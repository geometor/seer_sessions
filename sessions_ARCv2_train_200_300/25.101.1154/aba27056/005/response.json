Identify all pixels in the input grid that have the background color, white (0).\n3.  From these white pixels, identify the subset located on the grid's boundary (top row, bottom row, left column, right column). These are the starting \"source\" pixels.\n4.  Determine the set of all white pixels that can be reached starting from *any* source pixel by moving only between adjacent (up, down, left, right) white pixels. Let this set be the \"fillable\" pixels.\n5.  Apply a selection rule (currently unknown) to choose a subset of the \"fillable\" pixels. These chosen pixels are the \"target\" pixels. \n    ***NOTE: This implementation assumes the simplest rule: all \"fillable\" pixels are \"target\" pixels. This assumption is known to be incorrect based on the provided training examples, as it leads to overfilling. The true selection rule remains unidentified.***\n6.  Modify the output grid: For every pixel location `(r, c)` that belongs to the set of \"target\" pixels (in this implementation, all \"fillable\" pixels), change its color to yellow (4).\n7.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid unchanged from their color in the input grid. This includes the original non-white shapes and any white pixels that were not \"fillable\".\n\"\"\"\n\nimport copy\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Fills the white areas (0) connected to the boundary with yellow (4),\n    stopping at non-white pixels.
