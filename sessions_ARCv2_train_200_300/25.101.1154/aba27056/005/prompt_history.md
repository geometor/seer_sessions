**Perception:**

The task involves transforming an input grid containing a white background (0) and one or more shapes made of a single non-white color (foreground color) into an output grid. The foreground shapes from the input are preserved in the output. The transformation focuses on changing the color of some white pixels to yellow (4).

Observing the examples:
1.  **Train 1:** An orange (7) shape like '3'. The white area connected to the grid boundary, spreading around the '3', is filled with yellow (4). The white pixels technically "inside" the curves of the '3' are also filled yellow, suggesting they are reachable from the boundary fill.
2.  **Train 2:** A magenta (6) shape like an 'H'. The white area outside the 'H' connected to the boundary is filled yellow. The white area enclosed within the 'H' is also filled yellow. Both regions become connected via 4-connectivity through the gaps in the 'H'.
3.  **Train 3:** Green (3) shapes forming an outer frame and an inner rectangle. The white area between the frames and the white area in the bottom rows (connected to the boundary) appear to be targeted for filling. However, comparing the input white pixels and output yellow/white pixels shows a specific pattern: not all white pixels reachable from the boundary are filled yellow. Specifically, white pixels adjacent to the green frame at (4,0), (4,5) and white pixels on the boundary at (5,1), (5,4), plus internal white pixels (3,1), (3,4) remain white
, while others reachable from the boundary turn yellow.

The common logic appears to be a "flood fill" originating from the grid boundary. The fill color is yellow (4), and it spreads through connected white (0) pixels, stopping when it hits a non-white pixel. The discrepancy in Train 3 suggests either a subtlety in the rule or a potential ambiguity in interpreting the output image provided. Assuming the core logic is consistent, the most likely rule is a standard flood fill from boundary white pixels.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
2.  Identify all white pixels (color 0) that are located on the outermost border (top row, bottom row, leftmost column, rightmost column) of the input grid. These are the starting points for the fill.
3.  Initiate a flood fill process using the identified starting points.
4.  The fill color is yellow (color 4).
5.  The fill spreads from a filled pixel to its adjacent (up, down, left, right) neighbors only if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries and is currently white (color 0).
6.  When a white pixel is filled, change its color to yellow (4) in the output grid. Mark it as visited to avoid re-processing.
7.  The fill process stops spreading when it encounters a pixel that is not white (i.e., part of the original foreground shape) or reaches the grid boundaries.
8.  Continue the process until no more white pixels can be reached and filled from the initial boundary starting points.
9.  The resulting output grid reflects the original foreground shape(s) and the newly filled yellow areas.

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis was that the transformation involved a flood fill starting from the white pixels (0) on the grid boundary, filling with yellow (4) and stopping at non-white pixels. The provided code implemented this logic. However, comparing the code's output to the expected output for the training examples revealed significant discrepancies. The code tended to fill *all* white pixels reachable from the boundary, whereas the expected outputs showed only a *subset* of these pixels turning yellow.

Attempts to refine the rule by considering coordinate parity (`r+c`), distance from non-white pixels (Manhattan, Chebyshev), number of non-white neighbors, "shadow" casting, and diagonal alignment with visibility checks all failed to consistently reproduce the expected outputs across all three examples.

The most striking failure was the simple flood fill producing output identical to a complex "shadow/influence" model (`influence_TL` OR `influence_BR`), suggesting that the fundamental difference lies in *which* pixels are targeted for filling, rather than just the propagation mechanism itself.

Given the difficulty in finding a consistent rule matching the provided expected outputs, the strategy is to revert to the initial, most plausible concept (boundary flood fill) but highlight the observed discrepancies. There might be a subtle aspect of the flood fill (e.g., specific start points, modified propagation) or an entirely different mechanism at play. The current best approach is to document the flood fill clearly and acknowledge the inconsistencies with the provided examples require further investigation.

**Metrics:**

Metrics will be based on comparing the output of the initial `code_00.py` (standard boundary flood fill) with the expected outputs.

*   **Example 1 (Input 9x9):**
    *   Input white pixels: 66
    *   Expected output yellow pixels: 41
    *   Code output yellow pixels: 66
    *   Pixels incorrectly colored yellow by code: 25 (e.g., (0,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), etc.)
    *   Pixels that should be yellow but aren't (by code): 0
    *   Discrepancy: Code overfills significantly.

*   **Example 2 (Input 7x7):**
    *   Input white pixels: 34
    *   Expected output yellow pixels: 16
    *   Code output yellow pixels: 34
    *   Pixels incorrectly colored yellow by code: 18 (e.g., (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), etc.)
    *   Pixels that should be yellow but aren't (by code): 0
    *   Discrepancy: Code overfills significantly.

*   **Example 3 (Input 6x6):**
    *   Input white pixels: 18
    *   Expected output yellow pixels: 14
    *   Code output yellow pixels: 18
    *   Pixels incorrectly colored yellow by code: 4 ((4,0), (4,5), (5,1), (5,4))
    *   Pixels that should be yellow but aren't (by code): 0
    *   Discrepancy: Code overfills, but only slightly compared to Ex1 and Ex2. The pixels that *should* remain white according to the expected output are specifically (4,0), (4,5), (5,1), (5,4).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that have the background color, white (0).
3.  Identify the subset of these white pixels that are located on the grid's boundary (top row, bottom row, left column, right column). These are the initial starting points.
4.  Perform a search (like Breadth-First Search) starting from these initial boundary white pixels. The search explores the grid by moving between adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right).
5.  The search can only move into pixels that are within the grid boundaries and contain the background color, white (0). Keep track of all white pixels that are reached by this search.
6.  After the search is complete, modify the output grid: For every pixel location `(r, c)`, if the corresponding pixel in the input grid was white (0) AND this location `(r, c)` was reached by the search, change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to yellow (4).
7.  Pixels that were not white in the input grid, or white pixels that were not reached by the search starting from the boundary, remain unchanged in the output grid.

*(Self-correction note: This describes the standard boundary flood fill again. While this logic failed validation against the provided examples, it represents the most straightforward interpretation based on visual gestalt before detailed analysis revealed inconsistencies. The true rule is more complex and not yet determined.)*

Transformation Rule:

1.  Create the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all white (0) pixels located on the grid boundary (edges).
3.  Perform a flood fill (BFS) operation starting from these boundary white pixels.
4.  The fill color is yellow (4).
5.  The fill spreads only to adjacent (up, down, left, right) white (0) pixels within the grid bounds.
6.  Non-white pixels act as barriers, stopping the fill propagation.
7.  All white pixels reachable from the boundary via this flood fill are changed to yellow (4) in the output grid.
8.  Original non-white shapes and unreachable white pixels remain unchanged.

Note: This implementation reflects the standard flood fill approach described. As noted in the analysis phase, this specific logic did not perfectly match all training example outputs, suggesting a more nuanced rule might be required. However, this code represents the current best interpretation based on the NLP.

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis was that the transformation involves a standard flood fill originating from all white pixels on the grid boundary, using yellow (4) as the fill color and stopping at non-white pixels. The provided code (`code_00.py`) correctly implements this logic using a Breadth-First Search (BFS).

However, testing this code against the three training examples reveals significant discrepancies between the code's output and the expected output. In all examples, the code fills *more* white pixels than expected. The expected outputs seem to follow a selective fill pattern where only a subset of the white pixels reachable from the boundary are actually turned yellow.

Specifically:
*   Examples 1 and 2 show large regions near the top and left boundaries remaining white, even though they are connected to boundary pixels that initiate the fill in the code.
*   Example 3 is particularly puzzling, as the code's output is very close to the expected output, differing only by four specific white pixels that the code fills but should remain white according to the expected output.

Attempts to find a consistent alternative rule (e.g., based on coordinate parity, distance from shapes, visibility from corners, specific boundary segment starts, local neighborhood patterns) have failed to explain the results across all three examples. The pattern in the expected outputs is complex and does not seem to map to a single, simple geometric or topological modification of the flood fill.

The strategy is to document the standard boundary flood fill as the most plausible *initial* interpretation, clearly state that it fails validation against the provided examples, and quantify the discrepancies. The true rule remains elusive based on the provided data.

**Metrics:**

The metrics quantify the difference between the output of the standard boundary flood fill code (`code_00.py`) and the *expected* output for each training example.

*   **Example 1 (Input 9x9):**
    *   Input White Pixels: 66
    *   Expected Output Yellow Pixels: 41
    *   Code Output Yellow Pixels: 66
    *   Pixels Incorrectly Colored Yellow by Code (Should be White 0): 25
        *   Coordinates: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1) - (*Correction: Initial analysis missed some pixels*) Total 28 incorrect. Let's verify.

    *   Pixels Off: 4 (All are pixels the code turned yellow but should be white).
    *   Coordinates Incorrectly Yellow: (4,0), (4,5), (5,1), (5,4).
    *   Discrepancy: Code overfills only slightly. The failure points are specific and not easily explained by simple geometric properties tested so far.

task_type: selective_fill # Changed from flood_fill due to observed discrepancies
grid_properties:
  size: variable, input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  background_color: white (0)
  fill_color: yellow (4)
objects:
  - id: foreground_shape
    description: Contiguous shape(s) made of a single non-white color present in the input. These shapes remain unchanged in the output and act as barriers to filling.
    color: variable (orange 7, magenta 6, green 3 in examples)
  - id: background_pixels
    description: Pixels with the background color (white 0) in the input grid.
    color: white (0)
  - id: boundary_pixels
    description: Pixels located on the grid edges (row 0, row H-1, col 0, col W-1).
    color: any
  - id: source_pixels
    description: The subset of boundary_pixels that are also background_pixels (white 0). These are the potential starting points for the fill process.
    color: white (0)
  - id: fillable_pixels
    description: The set of background_pixels that are reachable from at least one source_pixel via a path of 4-adjacent background_pixels.
    color: white (0)
  - id: target_pixels
    description: >
      The specific subset of fillable_pixels that actually change color to yellow (4)
      in the output grid. The criteria for selecting target_pixels from fillable_pixels
      are not fully understood and represent the core challenge of this task.
      The standard flood fill assumes target_pixels = fillable_pixels, which has
      been shown incorrect by the examples.
    color: white (0) in input, yellow (4) in output
  - id: non_target_pixels
    description: >
      Background_pixels that remain white (0) in the output. This includes background_pixels
      not reachable from the boundary (e.g., enclosed holes initially white) AND
      the subset of fillable_pixels that meet the (unknown) criteria for *not*
      being filled yellow.
    color: white (0) in input and output
actions:
  - name: identify_components
    input: input grid
    output: coordinates and color of foreground_shape pixels, coordinates of background_pixels.
  - name: identify_source_pixels
    input: background_pixels, grid dimensions
    output: coordinates of source_pixels (white pixels on the boundary).
  - name: find_fillable_pixels
    input: input grid, source_pixels
    output: set of coordinates of fillable_pixels (perform standard flood fill reachability).
  - name: determine_target_pixels # The unknown step
    input: fillable_pixels, input_grid # Potentially needs full grid context
    output: set of coordinates of target_pixels (subset of fillable_pixels).
    # Note: The logic here is unclear. Standard flood fill (target = fillable) fails.
  - name: apply_fill
    input: input grid, target_pixels, fill_color
    output: output grid where target_pixels are set to fill_color, others retain input color.
transformation_hypothesis: # Explicitly framing as hypothesis due to uncertainty
  - step: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: Identify all white (0) pixels on the grid boundary (source_pixels).
  - step: Determine all white pixels reachable from any source_pixel via 4-adjacent white paths (fillable_pixels). This is done via a standard flood fill / BFS reachability analysis.
  - step: Identify a specific subset of these fillable_pixels as target_pixels based on an undetermined rule. (This rule is complex; in examples 1 & 2 it excludes many pixels near the top/left, in example 3 it excludes exactly four specific pixels).
  - step: For each pixel (r, c) in the target_pixels set, change its color to yellow (4) in the output grid.
  - step: All other pixels (foreground shapes, background pixels not in target_pixels) retain their original color from the input grid.
  - step: >
      NOTE: The standard flood fill algorithm (implemented in the provided code) assumes
      step 4 is trivial (target_pixels = fillable_pixels). This assumption leads to
      incorrect outputs for all provided training examples.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create the output grid by making an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that have the background color, white (0).
3.  From these white pixels, identify the subset located on the grid's boundary (top row, bottom row, left column, right column). These are the starting "source" pixels.
4.  Determine the set of all white pixels that can be reached starting from *any* source pixel by moving only between adjacent (up, down, left, right) white pixels. Let this set be the "fillable" pixels.
5.  **Apply a selection rule (currently unknown)** to choose a subset of the "fillable" pixels. These chosen pixels are the "target" pixels. *(Note: The standard flood fill rule assumes all fillable pixels are target pixels, but this is incorrect for this task based on the examples).*
6.  Modify the output grid: For every pixel location `(r, c)` that belongs to the set of "target" pixels, change its color to yellow (4).
7.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid unchanged from their color in the input grid. This includes the original non-white shapes and any white pixels that were either not "fillable" or were "fillable" but not selected as "target" pixels by the unknown rule in step 5.
