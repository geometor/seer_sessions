Identify all white (0) pixels located on the grid boundary (edges).\n3.  Perform a flood fill (BFS) operation starting from these boundary white pixels.\n4.  The fill color is yellow (4).\n5.  The fill spreads only to adjacent (up, down, left, right) white (0) pixels within the grid bounds.\n6.  Non-white pixels act as barriers, stopping the fill propagation.\n7.  All white pixels reachable from the boundary via this flood fill are changed to yellow (4) in the output grid.\n8.  Original non-white shapes and unreachable white pixels remain unchanged.\n\nNote: This implementation reflects the standard flood fill approach described. As noted in the analysis phase, this specific logic did not perfectly match all training example outputs, suggesting a more nuanced rule might be required. However, this code represents the current best interpretation based on the NLP.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport copy\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Fills the white areas (0) connected to the boundary with yellow (4),\n    stopping at non-white pixels.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid as a deep copy of the input grid\n    output_grid = copy.deepcopy(input_grid)\n    \n    # Get grid dimensions\n    height = len(input_grid)\n    if height == 0:\n        return []\n    width = len(input_grid[0])\n    if width == 0:\n        return [[] for _ in range(height)]\n\n    # Define fill color and background color\n    fill_color = 4\n    background_color = 0\n\n    # Initialize a queue for the flood fill (BFS)\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Identify boundary white pixels and add them to the queue\n    # Also, immediately color them in the output grid to mark as visited/source\n    # This prevents adding the same starting pixel multiple times if it's a corner\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Check if the pixel is on the boundary\n            is_boundary = (r == 0 or r == height - 1 or c == 0 or c == width - 1)\n            \n            # If it's a white pixel on the boundary AND hasn't been processed yet\n            if is_boundary and output_grid[r][c] == background_color:\n                 # Change color to fill color (mark as visited and source)\n                 output_grid[r][c] = fill_color\n                 # Add to the queue for processing neighbors\n                 queue.append((r, c))\n\n    # Define 4-way adjacent neighbors (dr, dc) for movement\n    neighbors = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)] # Right, Left, Down, Up\n\n    # Perform the flood fill using BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft() # Get the next pixel to process\n\n        # Explore its neighbors\n        for dr, dc in neighbors:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc # Calculate neighbor coordinates\n\n            # Check if the neighbor is within grid bounds\n            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                # Check if the neighbor is a background pixel (unvisited)\n                # We check output_grid because visited pixels are already colored yellow\n                if output_grid[nr][nc] == background_color:\n                    # Change color to fill color (mark as visited)\n                    output_grid[nr][nc] = fill_color\n                    # Add neighbor to the queue to process its neighbors later\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    # Return the modified grid\n    return output_grid\n```"
