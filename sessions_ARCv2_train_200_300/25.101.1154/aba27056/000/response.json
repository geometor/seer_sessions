The foreground shapes from the input are preserved in the output. The transformation focuses on changing the color of some white pixels to yellow (4).\n\nObserving the examples:\n1.  **Train 1:** An orange (7) shape like '3'. The white area connected to the grid boundary, spreading around the '3', is filled with yellow (4). The white pixels technically \"inside\" the curves of the '3' are also filled yellow, suggesting they are reachable from the boundary fill.\n2.  **Train 2:** A magenta (6) shape like an 'H'. The white area outside the 'H' connected to the boundary is filled yellow. The white area enclosed within the 'H' is also filled yellow. Both regions become connected via 4-connectivity through the gaps in the 'H'.\n3.  **Train 3:** Green (3) shapes forming an outer frame and an inner rectangle. The white area between the frames and the white area in the bottom rows (connected to the boundary) appear to be targeted for filling. However, comparing the input white pixels and output yellow/white pixels shows a specific pattern: not all white pixels reachable from the boundary are filled yellow. Specifically, white pixels adjacent to the green frame at (4,0), (4,5) and white pixels on the boundary at (5,1), (5,4), plus internal white pixels (3,1), (3,4) remain white"

          {
            "text": ", while others reachable from the boundary turn yellow.\n\nThe common logic appears to be a \"flood fill\" originating from the grid boundary. The fill color is yellow (4), and it spreads through connected white (0) pixels, stopping when it hits a non-white pixel. The discrepancy in Train 3 suggests either a subtlety in the rule or a potential ambiguity in interpreting the output image provided. Assuming the core logic is consistent, the most likely rule is a standard flood fill from boundary white pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

These are the starting points for the fill.\n3.  Initiate a flood fill process using the identified starting points.\n4.  The fill color is yellow (color 4).\n5.  The fill spreads from a filled pixel to its adjacent (up, down, left, right) neighbors only if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries and is currently white (color 0).\n6.  When a white pixel is filled, change its color to yellow (4) in the output grid. Mark it as visited to avoid re-processing.\n7.  The fill process stops spreading when it encounters a pixel that is not white (i.e., part of the original foreground shape) or reaches the grid boundaries.\n8.  Continue the process until no more white pixels can be reached and filled from the initial boundary starting points.\n9.  The resulting output grid reflects the original foreground shape(s) and the newly filled yellow areas."
