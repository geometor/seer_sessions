task_type: flood_fill
grid_properties:
  size: variable, input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  background_color: white (0)
  fill_color: yellow (4)
objects:
  - id: foreground_shape
    description: Contiguous shape(s) made of a single non-white color present in the input. Acts as a barrier to the fill.
    color: variable (orange 7, magenta 6, green 3 in examples)
  - id: background_pixels
    description: Pixels with the background color (white 0). These are candidates for filling.
    color: white (0)
actions:
  - name: identify_boundary_pixels
    input: input grid
    output: coordinates of all white (0) pixels located on the grid edges (row 0, row H-1, col 0, col W-1).
  - name: flood_fill
    description: Starting from a set of source pixels, fill connected background pixels with the fill color, stopping at non-background pixels.
    parameters:
      source_pixels: result of identify_boundary_pixels
      fill_color: yellow (4)
      background_color: white (0)
      barrier_colors: all colors except white (0)
      connectivity: 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right)
transformation:
  - step: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: Identify the set of source pixels for the fill (white pixels on the boundary).
  - step: Perform a flood fill operation starting from the source pixels.
  - step: The flood fill propagates through white (0) pixels only.
  - step: When a white pixel is visited by the flood fill, change its color to yellow (4) in the output grid.
  - step: The flood fill is blocked by any non-white pixel in the input grid.
  - step: Pixels of the foreground shape remain unchanged. White pixels not reached by the flood fill remain white.
