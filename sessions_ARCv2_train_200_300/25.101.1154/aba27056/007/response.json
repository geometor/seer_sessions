Identify all white pixels (color 0) in the input grid.\n3.  Determine the set of \"source\" pixels: white pixels located on the grid's boundary (top/bottom row or left/right column).\n4.  Find the set of all \"fillable\" white pixels: these are all white pixels that can be reached starting from *any* source pixel by moving only between adjacent (up, down, left, right) white pixels. Use a standard reachability search (like flood fill or BFS) for this.\n5.  Apply a specific, currently unknown, selection rule to choose a subset of the \"fillable\" pixels. These chosen pixels are the \"target\" pixels that will actually be colored yellow. \n    ***NOTE: This implementation assumes the simplest, incorrect rule: all \"fillable\" pixels are \"target\" pixels. This leads to overfilling compared to the expected outputs in the training examples. The correct selection rule remains unidentified.***\n6.  Modify the output grid: For every pixel location `(r, c)` that belongs to the \"target\" pixel set (in this implementation, all \"fillable\" pixels), change its color to yellow (4).\n7.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid unchanged from their original color in the input grid. This includes the original non-white shapes, any white pixels that were not \"fillable\", and any \"fillable\" white pixels that were not selected as \"target\" pixels by the (unknown) rule in step 5.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport copy\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Fills white areas (0) connected to the boundary with yellow (4),\n    stopping at non-white pixels.
