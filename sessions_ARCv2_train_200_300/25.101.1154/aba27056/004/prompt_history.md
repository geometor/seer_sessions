**Perception:**

The task involves transforming an input grid containing a white background (0) and one or more shapes made of a single non-white color (foreground color) into an output grid. The foreground shapes from the input are preserved in the output. The transformation focuses on changing the color of some white pixels to yellow (4).

Observing the examples:
1.  **Train 1:** An orange (7) shape like '3'. The white area connected to the grid boundary, spreading around the '3', is filled with yellow (4). The white pixels technically "inside" the curves of the '3' are also filled yellow, suggesting they are reachable from the boundary fill.
2.  **Train 2:** A magenta (6) shape like an 'H'. The white area outside the 'H' connected to the boundary is filled yellow. The white area enclosed within the 'H' is also filled yellow. Both regions become connected via 4-connectivity through the gaps in the 'H'.
3.  **Train 3:** Green (3) shapes forming an outer frame and an inner rectangle. The white area between the frames and the white area in the bottom rows (connected to the boundary) appear to be targeted for filling. However, comparing the input white pixels and output yellow/white pixels shows a specific pattern: not all white pixels reachable from the boundary are filled yellow. Specifically, white pixels adjacent to the green frame at (4,0), (4,5) and white pixels on the boundary at (5,1), (5,4), plus internal white pixels (3,1), (3,4) remain white
, while others reachable from the boundary turn yellow.

The common logic appears to be a "flood fill" originating from the grid boundary. The fill color is yellow (4), and it spreads through connected white (0) pixels, stopping when it hits a non-white pixel. The discrepancy in Train 3 suggests either a subtlety in the rule or a potential ambiguity in interpreting the output image provided. Assuming the core logic is consistent, the most likely rule is a standard flood fill from boundary white pixels.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
2.  Identify all white pixels (color 0) that are located on the outermost border (top row, bottom row, leftmost column, rightmost column) of the input grid. These are the starting points for the fill.
3.  Initiate a flood fill process using the identified starting points.
4.  The fill color is yellow (color 4).
5.  The fill spreads from a filled pixel to its adjacent (up, down, left, right) neighbors only if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries and is currently white (color 0).
6.  When a white pixel is filled, change its color to yellow (4) in the output grid. Mark it as visited to avoid re-processing.
7.  The fill process stops spreading when it encounters a pixel that is not white (i.e., part of the original foreground shape) or reaches the grid boundaries.
8.  Continue the process until no more white pixels can be reached and filled from the initial boundary starting points.
9.  The resulting output grid reflects the original foreground shape(s) and the newly filled yellow areas.

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis was that the transformation involved a flood fill starting from the white pixels (0) on the grid boundary, filling with yellow (4) and stopping at non-white pixels. The provided code implemented this logic. However, comparing the code's output to the expected output for the training examples revealed significant discrepancies. The code tended to fill *all* white pixels reachable from the boundary, whereas the expected outputs showed only a *subset* of these pixels turning yellow.

Attempts to refine the rule by considering coordinate parity (`r+c`), distance from non-white pixels (Manhattan, Chebyshev), number of non-white neighbors, "shadow" casting, and diagonal alignment with visibility checks all failed to consistently reproduce the expected outputs across all three examples.

The most striking failure was the simple flood fill producing output identical to a complex "shadow/influence" model (`influence_TL` OR `influence_BR`), suggesting that the fundamental difference lies in *which* pixels are targeted for filling, rather than just the propagation mechanism itself.

Given the difficulty in finding a consistent rule matching the provided expected outputs, the strategy is to revert to the initial, most plausible concept (boundary flood fill) but highlight the observed discrepancies. There might be a subtle aspect of the flood fill (e.g., specific start points, modified propagation) or an entirely different mechanism at play. The current best approach is to document the flood fill clearly and acknowledge the inconsistencies with the provided examples require further investigation.

**Metrics:**

Metrics will be based on comparing the output of the initial `code_00.py` (standard boundary flood fill) with the expected outputs.

*   **Example 1 (Input 9x9):**
    *   Input white pixels: 66
    *   Expected output yellow pixels: 41
    *   Code output yellow pixels: 66
    *   Pixels incorrectly colored yellow by code: 25 (e.g., (0,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), etc.)
    *   Pixels that should be yellow but aren't (by code): 0
    *   Discrepancy: Code overfills significantly.

*   **Example 2 (Input 7x7):**
    *   Input white pixels: 34
    *   Expected output yellow pixels: 16
    *   Code output yellow pixels: 34
    *   Pixels incorrectly colored yellow by code: 18 (e.g., (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), etc.)
    *   Pixels that should be yellow but aren't (by code): 0
    *   Discrepancy: Code overfills significantly.

*   **Example 3 (Input 6x6):**
    *   Input white pixels: 18
    *   Expected output yellow pixels: 14
    *   Code output yellow pixels: 18
    *   Pixels incorrectly colored yellow by code: 4 ((4,0), (4,5), (5,1), (5,4))
    *   Pixels that should be yellow but aren't (by code): 0
    *   Discrepancy: Code overfills, but only slightly compared to Ex1 and Ex2. The pixels that *should* remain white according to the expected output are specifically (4,0), (4,5), (5,1), (5,4).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that have the background color, white (0).
3.  Identify the subset of these white pixels that are located on the grid's boundary (top row, bottom row, left column, right column). These are the initial starting points.
4.  Perform a search (like Breadth-First Search) starting from these initial boundary white pixels. The search explores the grid by moving between adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right).
5.  The search can only move into pixels that are within the grid boundaries and contain the background color, white (0). Keep track of all white pixels that are reached by this search.
6.  After the search is complete, modify the output grid: For every pixel location `(r, c)`, if the corresponding pixel in the input grid was white (0) AND this location `(r, c)` was reached by the search, change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to yellow (4).
7.  Pixels that were not white in the input grid, or white pixels that were not reached by the search starting from the boundary, remain unchanged in the output grid.

*(Self-correction note: This describes the standard boundary flood fill again. While this logic failed validation against the provided examples, it represents the most straightforward interpretation based on visual gestalt before detailed analysis revealed inconsistencies. The true rule is more complex and not yet determined.)*
