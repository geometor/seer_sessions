            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis was that the transformation involves a standard flood fill originating from all white pixels on the grid boundary, using yellow (4) as the fill color and stopping at non-white pixels. The provided code (`code_00.py`) correctly implements this logic using a Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n\nHowever, testing this code against the three training examples reveals significant discrepancies between the code's output and the expected output. In all examples, the code fills *more* white pixels than expected. The expected outputs seem to follow a selective fill pattern where only a subset of the white pixels reachable from the boundary are actually turned yellow.\n\nSpecifically:\n*   Examples 1 and 2 show large regions near the top and left boundaries remaining white, even though they are connected to boundary pixels that initiate the fill in the code.\n*   Example 3 is particularly puzzling, as the code's output is very close to the expected output, differing only by four specific white pixels that the code fills but should remain white according to the expected output.\n\nAttempts to find a consistent alternative rule (e.g., based on coordinate parity, distance from shapes, visibility from corners, specific boundary segment starts, local neighborhood patterns) have failed to explain the results across all three examples. The pattern in the expected outputs is complex and does not seem to map to a single, simple geometric or topological modification of the flood fill.\n\nThe strategy is to document the standard boundary flood fill as the most plausible *initial* interpretation, clearly state that it fails validation against the provided examples, and quantify the discrepancies. The true rule remains elusive based on the provided data.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe metrics quantify the difference between the output of the standard boundary flood fill code (`code_00.py`) and the *expected* output for each training example.\n\n*   **Example 1 (Input 9x9):**\n    *   Input White Pixels: 66\n    *   Expected Output Yellow Pixels: 41\n    *   Code Output Yellow Pixels: 66\n    *   Pixels Incorrectly Colored Yellow by Code (Should be White 0): 25\n        *   Coordinates: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1) - (*Correction: Initial analysis missed some pixels*) Total 28 incorrect.
