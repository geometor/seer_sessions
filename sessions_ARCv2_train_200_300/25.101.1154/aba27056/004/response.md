**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis was that the transformation involves a standard flood fill originating from all white pixels on the grid boundary, using yellow (4) as the fill color and stopping at non-white pixels. The provided code (`code_00.py`) correctly implements this logic using a Breadth-First Search (BFS).

However, testing this code against the three training examples reveals significant discrepancies between the code's output and the expected output. In all examples, the code fills *more* white pixels than expected. The expected outputs seem to follow a selective fill pattern where only a subset of the white pixels reachable from the boundary are actually turned yellow.

Specifically:
*   Examples 1 and 2 show large regions near the top and left boundaries remaining white, even though they are connected to boundary pixels that initiate the fill in the code.
*   Example 3 is particularly puzzling, as the code's output is very close to the expected output, differing only by four specific white pixels that the code fills but should remain white according to the expected output.

Attempts to find a consistent alternative rule (e.g., based on coordinate parity, distance from shapes, visibility from corners, specific boundary segment starts, local neighborhood patterns) have failed to explain the results across all three examples. The pattern in the expected outputs is complex and does not seem to map to a single, simple geometric or topological modification of the flood fill.

The strategy is to document the standard boundary flood fill as the most plausible *initial* interpretation, clearly state that it fails validation against the provided examples, and quantify the discrepancies. The true rule remains elusive based on the provided data.

**Metrics:**

The metrics quantify the difference between the output of the standard boundary flood fill code (`code_00.py`) and the *expected* output for each training example.

    *   Input White Pixels: 66
    *   Expected Output Yellow Pixels: 41

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create the output grid by making an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that have the background color, white (0).
3.  From these white pixels, identify the subset located on the grid's boundary (top row, bottom row, left column, right column). These are the starting "source" pixels.
4.  Determine the set of all white pixels that can be reached starting from *any* source pixel by moving only between adjacent (up, down, left, right) white pixels. Let this set be the "fillable" pixels.
5.  **Apply a selection rule (currently unknown)** to choose a subset of the "fillable" pixels. These chosen pixels are the "target" pixels. *(Note: The standard flood fill rule assumes all fillable pixels are target pixels, but this is incorrect for this task based on the examples).*
6.  Modify the output grid: For every pixel location `(r, c)` that belongs to the set of "target" pixels, change its color to yellow (4).
7.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid unchanged from their color in the input grid. This includes the original non-white shapes and any white pixels that were either not "fillable" or were "fillable" but not selected as "target" pixels by the unknown rule in step 5.
