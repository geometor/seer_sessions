            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis implemented a standard flood fill algorithm starting from all white (0) pixels on the grid boundary, filling with yellow (4) and using non-white pixels as barriers. Testing this implementation against the provided training examples revealed that it consistently \"overfills\" the white areas compared to the expected outputs. Specifically, the standard flood fill colors *all* reachable white pixels yellow, whereas the expected outputs show that only a *subset* of these reachable pixels should be colored yellow.\n\nAnalysis of the pixels that were incorrectly colored yellow by the standard flood fill (i.e., pixels that are white and reachable from the boundary but should remain white according to the expected output) did not reveal a simple, consistent rule across all examples. Hypotheses based on:\n*   Distance from boundaries or foreground shapes\n*   Coordinate parity (r+c)\n*   Visibility or \"shadowing\" from corners or boundaries (Top-Left, Bottom-Right)\n*   Local neighborhood configurations (e.g., number of non-white neighbors)\n*   Starting the fill only from specific boundary segments or corners\n*   Set operations on fills originating from different boundary segments (e.g., TL vs BR)\n\nfailed to accurately predict the expected output for all three training examples simultaneously. The pattern of which reachable white pixels remain unfilled appears complex and context-dependent, possibly involving nuanced geometric relationships with the foreground shape(s) that are not immediately obvious.\n\nTherefore, the strategy is to:\n1.  Acknowledge that the true transformation involves selecting a *subset* of boundary-reachable white pixels.\n2.  Document the standard flood fill as a baseline approach that identifies the *potential* candidates for filling.\n3.  Clearly state that the rule for selecting the final subset from these candidates is currently unidentified based on the provided examples.\n4.  Provide detailed metrics showing the specific discrepancies for each example.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nMetrics compare the output of the standard boundary flood fill (`code_00.py`) with the expected output. \"Incorrectly Yellow\" refers to pixels that were white (0) in the input, reachable from the boundary (and thus colored 4 by the code), but are white (0) in the expected output.\n\n*   **Example 1 (Input 9x9):**\n    *   Pixels Off: 28\n    *   Incorrectly Yellow Pixels (Code=4, Expected=0): 28\n        \n\n*code_execution:*\n"
