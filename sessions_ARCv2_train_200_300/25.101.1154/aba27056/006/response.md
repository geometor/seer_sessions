**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis implemented a standard flood fill algorithm starting from all white (0) pixels on the grid boundary, filling with yellow (4) and using non-white pixels as barriers. Testing this implementation against the provided training examples revealed that it consistently "overfills" the white areas compared to the expected outputs. Specifically, the standard flood fill colors *all* reachable white pixels yellow, whereas the expected outputs show that only a *subset* of these reachable pixels should be colored yellow.

Analysis of the pixels that were incorrectly colored yellow by the standard flood fill (i.e., pixels that are white and reachable from the boundary but should remain white according to the expected output) did not reveal a simple, consistent rule across all examples. Hypotheses based on:
*   Distance from boundaries or foreground shapes
*   Coordinate parity (r+c)
*   Visibility or "shadowing" from corners or boundaries (Top-Left, Bottom-Right)
*   Local neighborhood configurations (e.g., number of non-white neighbors)
*   Starting the fill only from specific boundary segments or corners
*   Set operations on fills originating from different boundary segments (e.g., TL vs BR)

failed to accurately predict the expected output for all three training examples simultaneously. The pattern of which reachable white pixels remain unfilled appears complex and context-dependent, possibly involving nuanced geometric relationships with the foreground shape(s) that are not immediately obvious.

Therefore, the strategy is to:
1.  Acknowledge that the true transformation involves selecting a *subset* of boundary-reachable white pixels.
2.  Document the standard flood fill as a baseline approach that identifies the *potential* candidates for filling.
3.  Clearly state that the rule for selecting the final subset from these candidates is currently unidentified based on the provided examples.
4.  Provide detailed metrics showing the specific discrepancies for each example.

**Metrics:**

Metrics compare the output of the standard boundary flood fill (`code_00.py`) with the expected output. "Incorrectly Yellow" refers to pixels that were white (0) in the input, reachable from the boundary (and thus colored 4 by the code), but are white (0) in the expected output.

*   **Example 1 (Input 9x9):**
    *   Pixels Off: 28
    *   Incorrectly Yellow Pixels (Code=4, Expected=0): 28

    *   Discrepancy: The standard flood fill incorrectly colors only 4 pixels yellow. These pixels are (4,0), (4,5), (5,1), (5,4). Their positions relative to the green shape and the boundary seem specific, but the reason they are excluded is unclear.

  - step: Change the color of the `target_pixels` to yellow (4) in the output grid.
  - step: All other pixels (foreground shapes, unreachable white pixels, and fillable-but-not-targeted white pixels) retain their original input color.
  - uncertainty: The rule for selecting `target_pixels` from `fillable_pixels` is not determined. The standard flood fill approach (selecting all `fillable_pixels`) is incorrect.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create the initial output grid by making an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all white pixels (color 0) in the input grid.
3.  Determine the set of "source" pixels: white pixels located on the grid's boundary (top/bottom row or left/right column).
4.  Find the set of all "fillable" white pixels: these are all white pixels that can be reached starting from *any* source pixel by moving only between adjacent (up, down, left, right) white pixels. Use a standard reachability search (like flood fill or BFS) for this.
5.  **Apply a specific, currently unknown, selection rule** to choose a subset of the "fillable" pixels found in step 4. These chosen pixels are the "target" pixels that will actually be colored yellow. *(Note: Simply choosing all fillable pixels is incorrect based on the examples; some fillable pixels must be excluded by this rule).*
6.  Modify the output grid: For every pixel location `(r, c)` that belongs to the "target" pixel set identified in step 5, change its color to yellow (4).
7.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid unchanged from their original color in the input grid. This includes the original non-white shapes, any white pixels that were not "fillable" (i.e., not reachable from the boundary), and any "fillable" white pixels that were not selected as "target" pixels by the rule in step 5.
