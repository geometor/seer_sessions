**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis was that the transformation involved a flood fill starting from the white pixels (0) on the grid boundary, filling with yellow (4) and stopping at non-white pixels. The provided code implemented this logic. However, comparing the code's output to the expected output for the training examples revealed significant discrepancies. The code tended to fill *all* white pixels reachable from the boundary, whereas the expected outputs showed only a *subset* of these pixels turning yellow.

Attempts to refine the rule by considering coordinate parity (`r+c`), distance from non-white pixels (Manhattan, Chebyshev), number of non-white neighbors, "shadow" casting, and diagonal alignment with visibility checks all failed to consistently reproduce the expected outputs across all three examples.

The most striking failure was the simple flood fill producing output identical to a complex "shadow/influence" model (`influence_TL` OR `influence_BR`), suggesting that the fundamental difference lies in *which* pixels are targeted for filling, rather than just the propagation mechanism itself.

Given the difficulty in finding a consistent rule matching the provided expected outputs, the strategy is to revert to the initial, most plausible concept (boundary flood fill) but highlight the observed discrepancies. There might be a subtle aspect of the flood fill (e.g., specific start points, modified propagation) or an entirely different mechanism at play. The current best approach is to document the flood fill clearly and acknowledge the inconsistencies with the provided examples require further investigation.

**Metrics:**

Metrics will be based on comparing the output of the initial `code_00.py` (standard boundary flood fill) with the expected outputs.

*   **Example 1 (Input 9x9):**
    *   Input white pixels: 66
    *   Expected output yellow pixels: 41
    *   Code output yellow pixels: 66
    *   Pixels incorrectly colored yellow by code: 25 (e.g., (0,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), etc.)
    *   Pixels that should be yellow but aren't (by code): 0
    *   Discrepancy: Code overfills significantly.

*   **Example 2 (Input 7x7):**
    *   Input white pixels: 34
    *   Expected output yellow pixels: 16
    *   Code output yellow pixels: 34
    *   Pixels incorrectly colored yellow by code: 18 (e.g., (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), etc.)
    *   Pixels that should be yellow but aren't (by code): 0
    *   Discrepancy: Code overfills significantly.

*   **Example 3 (Input 6x6):**
    *   Input white pixels: 18
    *   Expected output yellow pixels: 14
    *   Code output yellow pixels: 18
    *   Pixels incorrectly colored yellow by code: 4 ((4,0), (4,5), (5,1), (5,4))
    *   Pixels that should be yellow but aren't (by code): 0
    *   Discrepancy: Code overfills, but only slightly compared to Ex1 and Ex2. The pixels that *should* remain white according to the expected output are specifically (4,0), (4,5), (5,1), (5,4).

  - id: target_pixels
    description: A subset of the background_pixels that change color to fill_color. The selection criteria are currently unclear but seem related to connectivity, boundary proximity, and potentially the geometry of the foreground_shape.
    color: white (0) in input, yellow (4) in output
  - id: non_target_pixels
    description: Background_pixels that remain white (0) in the output. In the provided examples, these often appear near the foreground shape or boundary in specific configurations not fully explained by simple flood fill.
    color: white (0) in input and output
actions:
  - name: identify_foreground
    input: input grid
    output: coordinates and color of non-white pixels.
  - name: identify_background
    input: input grid
    output: coordinates of white (0) pixels.
  - name: determine_fill_targets
    input: input grid, foreground coordinates, background coordinates
    output: set of coordinates of background pixels to be filled yellow.
    # Note: The logic for this step is the core uncertainty.
    # Initial hypothesis: Targets are all background pixels reachable via 4-connectivity from a white boundary pixel. (This failed tests).
    # Refined hypotheses (all failed): Based on coordinate parity, distance, neighbor counts, shadows, diagonal alignment.
    # Current best guess: Reverts to boundary flood fill, acknowledging failure.
  - name: apply_fill
    input: input grid, target coordinates, fill_color
    output: output grid with target pixels changed to fill_color.
transformation:
  - step: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: Identify all white (0) pixels on the grid boundary (row 0, H-1, col 0, W-1).
  - step: Perform a breadth-first search (flood fill) starting from these boundary white pixels.
  - step: The search propagates only to 4-adjacent white (0) pixels within the grid bounds.
  - step: Maintain a set of all white pixels visited/reachable during this search.
  - step: Iterate through all pixels (r, c) of the grid.
  - step: If the pixel (r, c) was white in the input AND it was visited/reachable by the boundary flood fill search, set its color to yellow (4) in the output grid.
  - step: Otherwise, the pixel retains its original color from the input grid.
  # Acknowledgment: This procedure matches the initial code and produced outputs inconsistent with the provided expected outputs for all training examples. The exact condition determining which reachable white pixels turn yellow remains unidentified.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that have the background color, white (0).
3.  Identify the subset of these white pixels that are located on the grid's boundary (top row, bottom row, left column, right column). These are the initial starting points.
4.  Perform a search (like Breadth-First Search) starting from these initial boundary white pixels. The search explores the grid by moving between adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right).
5.  The search can only move into pixels that are within the grid boundaries and contain the background color, white (0). Keep track of all white pixels that are reached by this search.
6.  After the search is complete, modify the output grid: For every pixel location `(r, c)`, if the corresponding pixel in the input grid was white (0) AND this location `(r, c)` was reached by the search, change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to yellow (4).
7.  Pixels that were not white in the input grid, or white pixels that were not reached by the search starting from the boundary, remain unchanged in the output grid.

*(Self-correction note: This describes the standard boundary flood fill again. While this logic failed validation against the provided examples, it represents the most straightforward interpretation based on visual gestalt before detailed analysis revealed inconsistencies. The true rule is more complex and not yet determined.)*
