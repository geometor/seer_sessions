            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial transformation rule, derived from `train_1`, correctly identified the 2x scaling and the handling of non-white input pixels. However, the rule for transforming white (0) input pixels was incorrect. The initial hypothesis was: \"If a white input pixel has *only* white cardinal neighbours, transform it into a 2x2 diagonal blue pattern `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`; otherwise, transform it into a 2x2 white block `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`.\"\n\nTesting this rule against `train_2` and `train_3` revealed discrepancies. Specifically:\n*   In `train_2`, input pixel (2,3) has only white cardinal neighbours, but the expected output block is white, not the blue pattern. The code incorrectly produced the blue pattern. Conversely, input pixels (3,2) and (4,1) have non-white cardinal neighbours, but the expected output is the blue pattern, while the code produced a white block.\n*   In `train_3`, numerous white input pixels like (0,0), (0,1), (1,2) have only white cardinal neighbours, but the expected output is a white block, while the code incorrectly produced the blue pattern.\n\nThis indicates the condition determining whether a white input pixel becomes a blue pattern or a white block is more complex than just checking cardinal neighbours. The errors suggest the rule needs to incorporate information about diagonal neighbours or the broader context.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-analyze White Pixel Transformation:** Focus on the white input pixels in all three examples. Compare those that result in a white output block versus those resulting in the blue pattern block.\n2.  **Identify Distinguishing Features:** Determine the properties (e.g., adjacency to non-white pixels in the 8-neighbourhood, configuration of the 2x2 input block) that differentiate the two cases for white input pixels.\n3.  **Formulate New Hypothesis:** Develop a revised rule for white pixels based on these features. A promising hypothesis is: A white pixel transforms to the blue pattern if and only if it is adjacent (cardinally or diagonally) to *any* non-white pixel in the input grid. Otherwise, it transforms to the white block. *Self-correction: Testing this hypothesis against Example 1 showed it failed for input pixels (0,1) and (1,0), predicting Blue where White was expected. The correct rule remains elusive based solely on local neighbourhood checks tested so far.*\n4.  **Refine NL Program and Facts:** Update the documentation to reflect the most accurate understanding, acknowledging the difficulty in precisely defining the white pixel rule but using the best hypothesis found. The structure (scaling, non-white pixel handling) remains the same. The core issue is the exact condition for the white -> blue pattern transformation.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nMetrics generation will focus on comparing the neighbourhood of white pixels leading to the two different output patterns across all examples.\n\n"

            "text": "**Findings from Metrics:**\n\nThe code execution analyzes white input pixels based on the *expected* output pattern.\n\n*   **White -> Blue Pattern:** These pixels sometimes have only white cardinal neighbours (`All Cardinal White: True`) and sometimes not. They sometimes have a non-white neighbour in the Moore neighbourhood (`Has Non-White Moore Neighbor: True`) and sometimes not (e.g., Ex2 (3,3), Ex2 (4,4), Ex3 (4,3), Ex3 (5,4)).\n*   **White -> White Block:** These pixels sometimes have only white cardinal neighbours and sometimes not. They sometimes have a non-white Moore neighbour and sometimes not.\n\nCrucially, the condition `All Cardinal White: True` does **not** reliably predict the Blue pattern (as seen in Ex2 (2,3), Ex3 (0,0) etc.). The condition `Has Non-White Moore Neighbor: True` also does **not** reliably predict the Blue pattern (as seen in Ex1 (0,1), Ex2 (0,1), Ex3 (0,4) etc. which produce White blocks).\n\nFurthermore, there are cases like Ex2 (3,3) and Ex2 (4,4) where the Blue pattern is expected, yet *all* neighbours (cardinal and diagonal) are white. This contradicts simple neighbourhood adjacency rules.\n\n**Conclusion:** The rule governing the transformation of white pixels is not based solely on the color of adjacent neighbours (cardinal or Moore). The initial hypothesis (blue if all cardinal neighbours are white) and subsequent variations tested are insufficient. There might be a non-local rule, a dependency on the specific configuration of neighbours, or a different principle at play. Given the analysis, the most robust parts of the initial perception are the 2x scaling and the direct colour expansion for non-white pixels. The white pixel rule requires further insight.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
