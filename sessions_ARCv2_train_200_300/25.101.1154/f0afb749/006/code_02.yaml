Input Grid:
  - object: grid
  - properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W
      - pixels: Located at (r, c), have a color C (0=white, 1-9 non-white)

Output Grid:
  - object: grid
  - properties:
      - height: 2H
      - width: 2W
      - pixels: Colors derived from input grid based on 2x2 blocks

Transformation Rules:
  - rule: Grid Scaling
    - action: Create an output grid with dimensions 2H x 2W.
    - relationship: Each input pixel I[r, c] corresponds to a 2x2 block in the output grid O, starting at O[2*r, 2*c].
  - rule: Non-White Pixel Expansion
    - condition: Input pixel I[r, c] has color C > 0.
    - action: Fill the corresponding output 2x2 block O[2*r : 2*r+2, 2*c : 2*c+2] entirely with color C.
  - rule: White Pixel Transformation
    - condition: Input pixel I[r, c] has color 0 (white).
    - action: Generate one of two patterns in the corresponding output 2x2 block O[2*r : 2*r+2, 2*c : 2*c+2]:
        - pattern_A: Diagonal Blue Pattern [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
        - pattern_B: White Block [[0, 0], [0, 0]]
    - determining_factor: A specific, currently unidentified condition P(r, c) associated with the input pixel I[r, c].
    - observation_1: P(r, c) is true (yields pattern_A) if I[r, c] = 0 and ... [condition unknown].
    - observation_2: P(r, c) is false (yields pattern_B) if I[r, c] = 0 and ... [condition unknown].
    - known_insufficiency: Condition P(r, c) is NOT solely determined by:
        - Whether all cardinal neighbours of I[r, c] are white.
        - Whether any cardinal neighbour of I[r, c] is non-white.
        - Whether all Moore neighbours (8 neighbours) of I[r, c] are white.
        - Whether any Moore neighbour of I[r, c] is non-white.
    - evidence: Metrics analysis shows counterexamples for all simple neighbourhood-based rules across the training set. For instance, some pixels with all-white Moore neighbours produce pattern_A, while others produce pattern_B. Some pixels with non-white cardinal neighbours produce pattern_A.
