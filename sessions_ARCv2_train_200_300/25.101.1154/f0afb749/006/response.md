**Assessment and Strategy**

The provided execution results confirm that the initial transformation rule, derived primarily from `train_1`, is incomplete. While the 2x scaling and the expansion of non-white pixels hold true across all examples, the rule governing the transformation of white pixels (0) is incorrect. The rule "transform a white pixel to a diagonal blue pattern `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]` if and only if all its existing cardinal neighbours are also white" fails significantly on `train_2` and `train_3`.

*   **Failure Cases:** The metrics show instances where white pixels with all-white cardinal neighbours result in a white block, and instances where white pixels with non-white cardinal neighbours result in the blue pattern.
*   **Complexity:** This indicates the determining factor for the white pixel transformation is more complex than a simple check of adjacent cardinal (or even Moore) neighbours' colors.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Retain Confirmed Rules:** Maintain the 2x scaling and the non-white pixel expansion logic.
2.  **Re-analyze White Pixels:** Focus specifically on the input context of white pixels across all training examples, comparing those that yield the blue pattern versus those that yield the white block in the *expected* outputs.
3.  **Hypothesize New Factors:** Consider alternative factors influencing the white pixel rule, such as:
    *   Positional information (e.g., row/column parity, distance from edge).
    *   Patterns within the 2x2 input block containing the white pixel.
    *   Non-local influences or relationships between pixels.
4.  **Generate Comprehensive Metrics:** Use code execution to systematically analyze properties of white pixels and their neighbourhoods against the expected output patterns, looking for a consistent distinguishing feature. The previous metrics analysis already disproved simple Cardinal and Moore neighbourhood rules.
5.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the knowns (scaling, non-white expansion) and the specific unknown (the precise condition `P(r,c)` for the white pixel transformation).

**Metrics Generation**

The following code analyzes each white input pixel across the three training examples, comparing its neighbourhood characteristics (all cardinal neighbours white, all Moore neighbours white) against the pattern observed in the corresponding 2x2 block of the *expected* output. This highlights the failure points of the simple neighbourhood-based rules.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Input Grid:
  - object: grid
  - properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W
      - pixels: Located at (r, c), have a color C (0=white, 1-9 non-white)

Output Grid:
  - object: grid
  - properties:
      - height: 2H
      - width: 2W
      - pixels: Colors derived from input grid based on 2x2 blocks

Transformation Rules:
  - rule: Grid Scaling
    - action: Create an output grid with dimensions 2H x 2W.
    - relationship: Each input pixel I[r, c] corresponds to a 2x2 block in the output grid O, starting at O[2*r, 2*c].
  - rule: Non-White Pixel Expansion
    - condition: Input pixel I[r, c] has color C > 0.
    - action: Fill the corresponding output 2x2 block O[2*r : 2*r+2, 2*c : 2*c+2] entirely with color C.
  - rule: White Pixel Transformation
    - condition: Input pixel I[r, c] has color 0 (white).
    - action: Generate one of two patterns in the corresponding output 2x2 block O[2*r : 2*r+2, 2*c : 2*c+2]:
        - pattern_A: Diagonal Blue Pattern [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
        - pattern_B: White Block [[0, 0], [0, 0]]
    - determining_factor: A specific, currently unidentified condition P(r, c) associated with the input pixel I[r, c].
    - observation_1: P(r, c) is true (yields pattern_A) if I[r, c] = 0 and ... [condition unknown].
    - observation_2: P(r, c) is false (yields pattern_B) if I[r, c] = 0 and ... [condition unknown].
    - known_insufficiency: Condition P(r, c) is NOT solely determined by:
        - Whether all cardinal neighbours of I[r, c] are white.
        - Whether any cardinal neighbour of I[r, c] is non-white.
        - Whether all Moore neighbours (8 neighbours) of I[r, c] are white.
        - Whether any Moore neighbour of I[r, c] is non-white.
    - evidence: Metrics analysis shows counterexamples for all simple neighbourhood-based rules across the training set. For instance, some pixels with all-white Moore neighbours produce pattern_A, while others produce pattern_B. Some pixels with non-white cardinal neighbours produce pattern_A.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input grid `I` with height `H` and width `W`.
2.  Create a new output grid `O` with height `2 * H` and width `2 * W`, initialized with white pixels (0).
3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid `I` at row `r` (from 0 to `H-1`) and column `c` (from 0 to `W-1`).
4.  Let `input_color` be the color of the input pixel `I[r, c]`.
5.  Calculate the top-left coordinates `(out_r, out_c)` for the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid: `out_r = 2 * r`, `out_c = 2 * c`.
6.  **If `input_color` is non-white (`input_color > 0`):**
    a.  Fill the 2x2 block in the output grid `O` starting at `(out_r, out_c)` entirely with `input_color`. (Specifically, set `O[out_r, out_c]`, `O[out_r+1, out_c]`, `O[out_r, out_c+1]`, and `O[out_r+1, out_c+1]` to `input_color`).
7.  **If `input_color` is white (`input_color == 0`):**
    a.  **Evaluate the specific condition `P(r, c)`** that determines the output pattern for this white pixel. (Note: The exact nature of this condition `P(r, c)` is currently unknown and requires further analysis; it is established that it does not solely depend on the colors of immediate cardinal or Moore neighbours).
    b.  **If condition `P(r, c)` evaluates to True:**
        i.  Set the output pixel `O[out_r, out_c]` to blue (1).
        ii. Set the output pixel `O[out_r+1, out_c+1]` to blue (1).
        iii. Ensure the other pixels in the block, `O[out_r, out_c+1]` and `O[out_r+1, out_c]`, are white (0) (they should be from initialization).
    c.  **If condition `P(r, c)` evaluates to False:**
        i.  Ensure the entire 2x2 block in `O` starting at `(out_r, out_c)` remains white (0) (this is the initialized state).
8.  Return the completed output grid `O`.
