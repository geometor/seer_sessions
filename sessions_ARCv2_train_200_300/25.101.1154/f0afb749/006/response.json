            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided execution results confirm that the initial transformation rule, derived primarily from `train_1`, is incomplete. While the 2x scaling and the expansion of non-white pixels hold true across all examples, the rule governing the transformation of white pixels (0) is incorrect. The rule \"transform a white pixel to a diagonal blue pattern `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]` if and only if all its existing cardinal neighbours are also white\" fails significantly on `train_2` and `train_3`.\n\n*   **Failure Cases:** The metrics show instances where white pixels with all-white cardinal neighbours result in a white block, and instances where white pixels with non-white cardinal neighbours result in the blue pattern.\n*   **Complexity:** This indicates the determining factor for the white pixel transformation is more complex than a simple check of adjacent cardinal (or even Moore) neighbours' colors.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Retain Confirmed Rules:** Maintain the 2x scaling and the non-white pixel expansion logic.\n2.  **Re-analyze White Pixels:** Focus specifically on the input context of white pixels across all training examples, comparing those that yield the blue pattern versus those that yield the white block in the *expected* outputs.\n3.  **Hypothesize New Factors:** Consider alternative factors influencing the white pixel rule, such as:\n    *   Positional information (e.g., row/column parity, distance from edge).\n    *   Patterns within the 2x2 input block containing the white pixel.\n    *   Non-local influences or relationships between pixels.\n4.  **Generate Comprehensive Metrics:** Use code execution to systematically analyze properties of white pixels and their neighbourhoods against the expected output patterns, looking for a consistent distinguishing feature. The previous metrics analysis already disproved simple Cardinal and Moore neighbourhood rules.\n5.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the knowns (scaling, non-white expansion) and the specific unknown (the precise condition `P(r,c)` for the white pixel transformation).\n\n**Metrics Generation**\n\nThe following code analyzes each white input pixel across the three training examples, comparing its neighbourhood characteristics (all cardinal neighbours white, all Moore neighbours white) against the pattern observed in the corresponding 2x2 block of the *expected* output. This highlights the failure points of the simple neighbourhood-based rules.\n\n\n"

Iterate through each pixel of the input grid `I` at row `r` (from 0 to `H-1`) and column `c` (from 0 to `W-1`).\n4.  Let `input_color` be the color of the input pixel `I[r, c]`.\n5.

Fill the 2x2 block in the output grid `O` starting at `(out_r, out_c)` entirely with `input_color`. (Specifically, set `O[out_r, out_c]`, `O[out_r+1, out_c]`, `O[out_r, out_c+1]`, and `O[out_r+1, out_c+1]` to `input_color`).\n7.  **If `input_color` is white (`input_color == 0`):**\n    a.  **Evaluate the specific condition `P(r, c)`** that determines the output pattern for this white pixel.
