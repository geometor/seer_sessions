**Perception:**

The core transformation involves scaling the input grid by a factor of two. Each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a 2x2 block in the output grid. The content of this 2x2 block is determined by the color of the original input pixel and its immediate orthogonal neighbours.

1.  **Scaling:** The output grid is twice the height and twice the width of the input grid.
2.  **Non-White Pixels:** If an input pixel has a color other than white (0), the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid is filled entirely with that color.
3.  **White Pixels:** If an input pixel is white (0), the corresponding 2x2 output block's content depends on the input pixel's cardinal neighbours (up, down, left, right).
    *   If all existing cardinal neighbours of the white input pixel are also white, the output block becomes a diagonal pattern: blue (1) top-left, white (0) top-right, white (0) bottom-left, blue (1) bottom-right.
    *   If any existing cardinal neighbour of the white input pixel is non-white, the output block remains entirely white (0).

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input Grid:
  - object: grid
  - properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W
      - pixels: Located at (r, c), have a color C (0-9, 0 is white)

Output Grid:
  - object: grid
  - properties:
      - height: 2H
      - width: 2W
      - pixels: Colors derived from input grid

Transformation Rules:
  - rule: Scaling
    - relationship: Each input pixel (r, c) maps to a 2x2 output block starting at (2*r, 2*c).
  - rule: Pattern Replacement based on Input Color and Neighbourhood
    - input_pixel: color C at (r, c)
    - output_block: 2x2 block starting at (2*r, 2*c)
    - condition: If C is not white (C > 0)
      - action: Fill output_block with color C. -> [[C, C], [C, C]]
    - condition: If C is white (C == 0)
      - sub_condition: Check cardinal neighbours (up, down, left, right) of input pixel (r, c). Are all neighbours that exist within the grid bounds also white (0)?
        - if True: Set output_block to [[blue(1), white(0)], [white(0), blue(1)]].
        - if False: Set output_block to [[white(0), white(0)], [white(0), white(0)]].
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an `output_grid` with dimensions `2 * input_height` by `2 * input_width`, filling it with the white color (0).
2.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the `input_grid`.
3.  Let `input_color` be the color of the cell `(r, c)`.
4.  Determine the top-left coordinates `(out_r, out_c)` of the corresponding 2x2 block in the `output_grid`, where `out_r = 2 * r` and `out_c = 2 * c`.
5.  If `input_color` is not white (`input_color > 0`):
    a.  Set the color of the four cells in the `output_grid` block starting at `(out_r, out_c)` (i.e., `(out_r, out_c)`, `(out_r+1, out_c)`, `(out_r, out_c+1)`, `(out_r+1, out_c+1)`) to `input_color`.
6.  If `input_color` is white (`input_color == 0`):
    a.  Assume initially that the condition for the special blue pattern is `True`.
    b.  Check the neighbor above: If `r > 0` and the color of `input_grid[r-1, c]` is not white, set the condition to `False`.
    c.  Check the neighbor below: If `r < input_height - 1` and the color of `input_grid[r+1, c]` is not white, set the condition to `False`.
    d.  Check the neighbor left: If `c > 0` and the color of `input_grid[r, c-1]` is not white, set the condition to `False`.
    e.  Check the neighbor right: If `c < input_width - 1` and the color of `input_grid[r, c+1]` is not white, set the condition to `False`.
    f.  If the condition remains `True` after checking all neighbours:
        i.  Set `output_grid[out_r, out_c]` to blue (1).
        ii. Set `output_grid[out_r+1, out_c+1]` to blue (1).
    g.  (Otherwise, if the condition became `False`, the block remains white (0) as initialized).
7.  Return the final `output_grid`.

**Assessment and Strategy**

The initial transformation rule, derived from `train_1`, correctly identified the 2x scaling and the handling of non-white input pixels. However, the rule for transforming white (0) input pixels was incorrect. The initial hypothesis was: "If a white input pixel has *only* white cardinal neighbours, transform it into a 2x2 diagonal blue pattern `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`; otherwise, transform it into a 2x2 white block `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`."

Testing this rule against `train_2` and `train_3` revealed discrepancies. Specifically:
*   In `train_2`, input pixel (2,3) has only white cardinal neighbours, but the expected output block is white, not the blue pattern. The code incorrectly produced the blue pattern. Conversely, input pixels (3,2) and (4,1) have non-white cardinal neighbours, but the expected output is the blue pattern, while the code produced a white block.
*   In `train_3`, numerous white input pixels like (0,0), (0,1), (1,2) have only white cardinal neighbours, but the expected output is a white block, while the code incorrectly produced the blue pattern.

This indicates the condition determining whether a white input pixel becomes a blue pattern or a white block is more complex than just checking cardinal neighbours. The errors suggest the rule needs to incorporate information about diagonal neighbours or the broader context.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-analyze White Pixel Transformation:** Focus on the white input pixels in all three examples. Compare those that result in a white output block versus those resulting in the blue pattern block.
2.  **Identify Distinguishing Features:** Determine the properties (e.g., adjacency to non-white pixels in the 8-neighbourhood, configuration of the 2x2 input block) that differentiate the two cases for white input pixels.
3.  **Formulate New Hypothesis:** Develop a revised rule for white pixels based on these features. A promising hypothesis is: A white pixel transforms to the blue pattern if and only if it is adjacent (cardinally or diagonally) to *any* non-white pixel in the input grid. Otherwise, it transforms to the white block. *Self-correction: Testing this hypothesis against Example 1 showed it failed for input pixels (0,1) and (1,0), predicting Blue where White was expected. The correct rule remains elusive based solely on local neighbourhood checks tested so far.*
4.  **Refine NL Program and Facts:** Update the documentation to reflect the most accurate understanding, acknowledging the difficulty in precisely defining the white pixel rule but using the best hypothesis found. The structure (scaling, non-white pixel handling) remains the same. The core issue is the exact condition for the white -> blue pattern transformation.

**Metrics**

Metrics generation will focus on comparing the neighbourhood of white pixels leading to the two different output patterns across all examples.

**Findings from Metrics:**

The code execution analyzes white input pixels based on the *expected* output pattern.

*   **White -> Blue Pattern:** These pixels sometimes have only white cardinal neighbours (`All Cardinal White: True`) and sometimes not. They sometimes have a non-white neighbour in the Moore neighbourhood (`Has Non-White Moore Neighbor: True`) and sometimes not (e.g., Ex2 (3,3), Ex2 (4,4), Ex3 (4,3), Ex3 (5,4)).
*   **White -> White Block:** These pixels sometimes have only white cardinal neighbours and sometimes not. They sometimes have a non-white Moore neighbour and sometimes not.

Crucially, the condition `All Cardinal White: True` does **not** reliably predict the Blue pattern (as seen in Ex2 (2,3), Ex3 (0,0) etc.). The condition `Has Non-White Moore Neighbor: True` also does **not** reliably predict the Blue pattern (as seen in Ex1 (0,1), Ex2 (0,1), Ex3 (0,4) etc. which produce White blocks).

Furthermore, there are cases like Ex2 (3,3) and Ex2 (4,4) where the Blue pattern is expected, yet *all* neighbours (cardinal and diagonal) are white. This contradicts simple neighbourhood adjacency rules.

**Conclusion:** The rule governing the transformation of white pixels is not based solely on the color of adjacent neighbours (cardinal or Moore). The initial hypothesis (blue if all cardinal neighbours are white) and subsequent variations tested are insufficient. There might be a non-local rule, a dependency on the specific configuration of neighbours, or a different principle at play. Given the analysis, the most robust parts of the initial perception are the 2x scaling and the direct colour expansion for non-white pixels. The white pixel rule requires further insight.

    - input_pixel: color C at (r, c)
    - output_block: 2x2 block starting at (2*r, 2*c)
    - condition: If C is non-white (C > 0)
      - action: Fill output_block with color C. -> [[C, C], [C, C]]
    - condition: If C is white (C == 0)
      - sub_condition: Check unknown property P(r, c) related to the input pixel's context (neighbourhood, position, etc.).
        - if P(r, c) is True: Set output_block to [[blue(1), white(0)], [white(0), blue(1)]].
        - if P(r, c) is False: Set output_block to [[white(0), white(0)], [white(0), white(0)]].
      - observation: The property P(r,c) is not simply whether all cardinal neighbours are white, nor whether any Moore neighbour is non-white. P(r,c) is true for some white pixels completely surrounded by white (e.g., Ex2 (3,3)), and false for others (e.g., Ex2 (2,3)).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an `output_grid` with dimensions `2 * input_height` by `2 * input_width`, filling it with the white color (0).
2.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the `input_grid`.
3.  Let `input_color` be the color of the cell `(r, c)`.
4.  Determine the top-left coordinates `(out_r, out_c)` of the corresponding 2x2 block in the `output_grid`, where `out_r = 2 * r` and `out_c = 2 * c`.
5.  If `input_color` is not white (`input_color > 0`):
    a.  Set the color of the four cells in the `output_grid` block starting at `(out_r, out_c)` (i.e., `(out_r, out_c)`, `(out_r+1, out_c)`, `(out_r, out_c+1)`, `(out_r+1, out_c+1)`) to `input_color`.
6.  If `input_color` is white (`input_color == 0`):
    a.  **Determine if the condition for the blue diagonal pattern is met for the input pixel (r, c).** (Note: The exact condition is currently unclear but is not simply based on cardinal or Moore neighbourhood checks.)
    b.  **If the condition is met:**
        i.  Set `output_grid[out_r, out_c]` to blue (1).
        ii. Set `output_grid[out_r + 1, out_c + 1]` to blue (1).
        iii. Set `output_grid[out_r, out_c + 1]` to white (0).
        iv. Set `output_grid[out_r + 1, out_c]` to white (0).
    c.  **If the condition is not met:**
        i.  Set the four cells in the `output_grid` block starting at `(out_r, out_c)` to white (0) (they are already initialized to 0, so no action is needed unless the initialization changes).
7.  Return the final `output_grid`.
```python
"""
Transforms the input grid according to the following rules:

1.  The output grid dimensions are twice the height and twice the width of the input grid.
2.  Each pixel (cell) in the input grid at coordinates (r, c) corresponds to a 2x2 block in the output grid, starting at coordinates (2*r, 2*c).
3.  If an input pixel has a non-white color (value > 0), the corresponding 2x2 output block is filled entirely with that color.
4.  If an input pixel is white (value == 0), its corresponding 2x2 output block is determined by its cardinal neighbours (up, down, left, right) in the input grid:
    a.  If all existing cardinal neighbours of the white input pixel are also white (0), the output block becomes a diagonal blue pattern: [[1, 0], [0, 1]].
    b.  If any existing cardinal neighbour of the white input pixel is non-white (> 0), the output block remains entirely white: [[0, 0], [0, 0]].

**Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis, based primarily on `train_1`, led to a transformation rule where the output grid is scaled 2x, non-white pixels expand to fill their corresponding 2x2 block, and white pixels transform based on their cardinal neighbours: becoming a diagonal blue pattern `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]` if all cardinal neighbours are white, and a white block `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]` otherwise.

Testing this rule (implemented in the provided Python code) against `train_2` and `train_3` revealed significant discrepancies, as shown by the non-zero `Pixels Off` counts and `Match: False` results. The core issue lies in the rule governing the transformation of white input pixels. The simple condition based on cardinal neighbours fails in numerous cases across `train_2` and `train_3`. Some white pixels with all-white cardinal neighbours produce white blocks (contrary to the rule), and some white pixels with non-white cardinal neighbours produce the blue pattern (also contrary to the rule).

Further analysis using Moore neighbourhoods (including diagonals) also failed to find a consistent local rule. White pixels completely surrounded by other white pixels (in their 3x3 neighbourhood) can result in *either* the blue pattern or a white block, indicating the determining factor is not solely the immediate neighbourhood's color composition.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Confirm Core Logic:** The 2x scaling and the expansion of non-white pixels appear consistent across all examples and should be retained.
2.  **Isolate White Pixel Rule:** The primary challenge is to identify the correct condition `P(r, c)` that determines whether a white input pixel `I[r, c]` results in the blue pattern `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]` or the white block `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`.
3.  **Re-evaluate Assumptions:** Since simple local neighbourhood rules (Cardinal, Moore) failed, consider other possibilities:
    *   Is the rule based on a larger pattern (e.g., checkerboard, relative position)?
    *   Does it depend on the configuration/pattern within a 2x2 input block?
    *   Is there a concept of "influence" or "distance" from non-white pixels that wasn't captured correctly?
    *   Could the transformation happen in stages, where the initial expansion influences subsequent steps? (Hypothesis tested in thought process, failed).
4.  **Focus on Failing Cases:** Systematically list the input white pixels where the initial rule failed and compare their contexts (neighbours, position, surrounding patterns) to find a distinguishing feature.
5.  **Metrics:** Use code execution to gather data on various properties of the white pixels and their neighbourhoods, comparing those that lead to the blue pattern versus the white block, specifically focusing on the cases where the initial rule failed.

**Metrics Generation**

The following code re-analyzes the white input pixels based on the *provided expected outputs*, focusing on the relationship between the input pixel's neighbourhood (Cardinal and Moore) and the resulting output pattern (Blue or White). This confirms the failure of simple neighbourhood rules.

**Metrics Findings:**
The metrics confirm the failure of the simple cardinal neighbour rule:
*   `(!) Blue pattern despite non-white Cardinal neighbour(s)` occurred in Ex2 for `(3, 2)` and `(4, 1)`.
*   `(!) White block despite all Cardinal neighbours being white` occurred frequently in Ex2 and Ex3.

The Moore neighbourhood analysis (`All Moore White?`) also fails to provide a clear separation:
*   There are Blue patterns where all Moore neighbours are white (e.g., Ex2 `(1,4), (2,0), (2,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)`; Ex3 `(4,3), (5,4)`).
*   There are White blocks where all Moore neighbours are white (e.g., Ex2 `(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,0)`; Ex3 many cases).

**Conclusion:** The rule governing the white pixel transformation is not determined solely by the colour values within the immediate Cardinal or Moore neighbourhood. The mechanism remains unidentified based on this local analysis.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Input Grid:
  - object: grid
  - properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W
      - pixels: Located at (r, c), have a color C (0=white, 1-9 non-white)

Output Grid:
  - object: grid
  - properties:
      - height: 2H
      - width: 2W
      - pixels: Colors derived from input grid based on 2x2 blocks

Transformation Rules:
  - rule: Scaling
    - relationship: The output grid dimensions are 2H x 2W.
    - relationship: Each input pixel (r, c) conceptually maps to a 2x2 output block starting at (2*r, 2*c).
  - rule: Non-White Pixel Expansion
    - condition: Input pixel I[r, c] has color C > 0.
    - action: The corresponding output 2x2 block O[2*r : 2*r+2, 2*c : 2*c+2] is filled with color C, i.e., [[C, C], [C, C]].
  - rule: White Pixel Transformation
    - condition: Input pixel I[r, c] has color 0 (white).
    - action: The corresponding output 2x2 block O[2*r : 2*r+2, 2*c : 2*c+2] becomes either:
        - Pattern A: [[1, 0], [0, 1]] (Diagonal Blue)
        - Pattern B: [[0, 0], [0, 0]] (White Block)
    - unresolved_condition: The specific condition P(r, c) determining whether Pattern A or Pattern B is generated is NOT simply dependent on whether all Cardinal neighbours are white, nor whether all Moore neighbours are white. The exact mechanism is currently unidentified. P(r, c) is true (produces Blue) for some white pixels surrounded only by white, and false (produces White) for others.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the dimensions of the input grid: `H` (height) and `W` (width).
2.  Initialize an output grid `O` with dimensions `2 * H` by `2 * W`, filling it entirely with the white color (0).
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid `I` from `r = 0` to `H-1` and `c = 0` to `W-1`.
4.  Get the color `C = I[r, c]`.
5.  **If `C` is non-white (`C > 0`):**
    a.  Calculate the top-left coordinates of the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid: `out_r = 2 * r`, `out_c = 2 * c`.
    b.  Fill the 2x2 block in the output grid `O` starting at `(out_r, out_c)` with the color `C`. That is, set `O[out_r, out_c]`, `O[out_r+1, out_c]`, `O[out_r, out_c+1]`, and `O[out_r+1, out_c+1]` to `C`.
6.  **If `C` is white (`C == 0`):**
    a.  Calculate the top-left coordinates of the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid: `out_r = 2 * r`, `out_c = 2 * c`.
    b.  **Determine if the condition `P(r, c)` for generating the diagonal blue pattern `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]` is met.** (Note: The precise nature of condition `P(r, c)` is currently unknown, but it is *not* simply whether all cardinal or Moore neighbours are white.)
    c.  **If condition `P(r, c)` is met:**
        i.  Set `O[out_r, out_c]` to blue (1).
        ii. Set `O[out_r+1, out_c+1]` to blue (1).
        iii. Ensure `O[out_r, out_c+1]` and `O[out_r+1, out_c]` are white (0) (they should be from initialization unless overwritten by a neighbouring non-white pixel's expansion; this step might need careful implementation depending on iteration order or if a final pass is used).
    d.  **If condition `P(r, c)` is NOT met:**
        i.  Ensure the 2x2 block in `O` starting at `(out_r, out_c)` remains entirely white (0). (This is the default initialization state, so potentially no action is needed unless overwritten).
7.  Return the final output grid `O`.

Transforms the input grid according to the following rules:

1.  The output grid dimensions are twice the height and twice the width of the input grid.
2.  Each pixel (cell) in the input grid at coordinates (r, c) corresponds to a 2x2 block in the output grid, starting at coordinates (2*r, 2*c).
3.  If an input pixel has a non-white color (value > 0), the corresponding 2x2 output block is filled entirely with that color.
4.  If an input pixel is white (value == 0), its corresponding 2x2 output block is determined by its cardinal neighbours (up, down, left, right) in the input grid:
    a.  If all existing cardinal neighbours of the white input pixel are also white (0), the output block becomes a diagonal blue pattern: [[1, 0], [0, 1]].
    b.  If any existing cardinal neighbour of the white input pixel is non-white (> 0), the output block remains entirely white: [[0, 0], [0, 0]].

The exact condition for transforming a white pixel into the blue diagonal pattern is complex and not fully captured by only checking cardinal neighbours.

**Assessment and Strategy**

The provided execution results confirm that the initial transformation rule, derived primarily from `train_1`, is incomplete. While the 2x scaling and the expansion of non-white pixels hold true across all examples, the rule governing the transformation of white pixels (0) is incorrect. The rule "transform a white pixel to a diagonal blue pattern `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]` if and only if all its existing cardinal neighbours are also white" fails significantly on `train_2` and `train_3`.

*   **Failure Cases:** The metrics show instances where white pixels with all-white cardinal neighbours result in a white block, and instances where white pixels with non-white cardinal neighbours result in the blue pattern.
*   **Complexity:** This indicates the determining factor for the white pixel transformation is more complex than a simple check of adjacent cardinal (or even Moore) neighbours' colors.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Retain Confirmed Rules:** Maintain the 2x scaling and the non-white pixel expansion logic.
2.  **Re-analyze White Pixels:** Focus specifically on the input context of white pixels across all training examples, comparing those that yield the blue pattern versus those that yield the white block in the *expected* outputs.
3.  **Hypothesize New Factors:** Consider alternative factors influencing the white pixel rule, such as:
    *   Positional information (e.g., row/column parity, distance from edge).
    *   Patterns within the 2x2 input block containing the white pixel.
    *   Non-local influences or relationships between pixels.
4.  **Generate Comprehensive Metrics:** Use code execution to systematically analyze properties of white pixels and their neighbourhoods against the expected output patterns, looking for a consistent distinguishing feature. The previous metrics analysis already disproved simple Cardinal and Moore neighbourhood rules.
5.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the knowns (scaling, non-white expansion) and the specific unknown (the precise condition `P(r,c)` for the white pixel transformation).

**Metrics Generation**

The following code analyzes each white input pixel across the three training examples, comparing its neighbourhood characteristics (all cardinal neighbours white, all Moore neighbours white) against the pattern observed in the corresponding 2x2 block of the *expected* output. This highlights the failure points of the simple neighbourhood-based rules.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Input Grid:
  - object: grid
  - properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W
      - pixels: Located at (r, c), have a color C (0=white, 1-9 non-white)

Output Grid:
  - object: grid
  - properties:
      - height: 2H
      - width: 2W
      - pixels: Colors derived from input grid based on 2x2 blocks

Transformation Rules:
  - rule: Grid Scaling
    - action: Create an output grid with dimensions 2H x 2W.
    - relationship: Each input pixel I[r, c] corresponds to a 2x2 block in the output grid O, starting at O[2*r, 2*c].
  - rule: Non-White Pixel Expansion
    - condition: Input pixel I[r, c] has color C > 0.
    - action: Fill the corresponding output 2x2 block O[2*r : 2*r+2, 2*c : 2*c+2] entirely with color C.
  - rule: White Pixel Transformation
    - condition: Input pixel I[r, c] has color 0 (white).
    - action: Generate one of two patterns in the corresponding output 2x2 block O[2*r : 2*r+2, 2*c : 2*c+2]:
        - pattern_A: Diagonal Blue Pattern [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
        - pattern_B: White Block [[0, 0], [0, 0]]
    - determining_factor: A specific, currently unidentified condition P(r, c) associated with the input pixel I[r, c].
    - observation_1: P(r, c) is true (yields pattern_A) if I[r, c] = 0 and ... [condition unknown].
    - observation_2: P(r, c) is false (yields pattern_B) if I[r, c] = 0 and ... [condition unknown].
    - known_insufficiency: Condition P(r, c) is NOT solely determined by:
        - Whether all cardinal neighbours of I[r, c] are white.
        - Whether any cardinal neighbour of I[r, c] is non-white.
        - Whether all Moore neighbours (8 neighbours) of I[r, c] are white.
        - Whether any Moore neighbour of I[r, c] is non-white.
    - evidence: Metrics analysis shows counterexamples for all simple neighbourhood-based rules across the training set. For instance, some pixels with all-white Moore neighbours produce pattern_A, while others produce pattern_B. Some pixels with non-white cardinal neighbours produce pattern_A.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input grid `I` with height `H` and width `W`.
2.  Create a new output grid `O` with height `2 * H` and width `2 * W`, initialized with white pixels (0).
3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid `I` at row `r` (from 0 to `H-1`) and column `c` (from 0 to `W-1`).
4.  Let `input_color` be the color of the input pixel `I[r, c]`.
5.  Calculate the top-left coordinates `(out_r, out_c)` for the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid: `out_r = 2 * r`, `out_c = 2 * c`.
6.  **If `input_color` is non-white (`input_color > 0`):**
    a.  Fill the 2x2 block in the output grid `O` starting at `(out_r, out_c)` entirely with `input_color`. (Specifically, set `O[out_r, out_c]`, `O[out_r+1, out_c]`, `O[out_r, out_c+1]`, and `O[out_r+1, out_c+1]` to `input_color`).
7.  **If `input_color` is white (`input_color == 0`):**
    a.  **Evaluate the specific condition `P(r, c)`** that determines the output pattern for this white pixel. (Note: The exact nature of this condition `P(r, c)` is currently unknown and requires further analysis; it is established that it does not solely depend on the colors of immediate cardinal or Moore neighbours).
    b.  **If condition `P(r, c)` evaluates to True:**
        i.  Set the output pixel `O[out_r, out_c]` to blue (1).
        ii. Set the output pixel `O[out_r+1, out_c+1]` to blue (1).
        iii. Ensure the other pixels in the block, `O[out_r, out_c+1]` and `O[out_r+1, out_c]`, are white (0) (they should be from initialization).
    c.  **If condition `P(r, c)` evaluates to False:**
        i.  Ensure the entire 2x2 block in `O` starting at `(out_r, out_c)` remains white (0) (this is the initialized state).
8.  Return the completed output grid `O`.
