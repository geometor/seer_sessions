Grid Scaling: The output grid dimensions are twice the height (2H) and twice the width (2W) of the input grid (H x W). Each input pixel I[r, c] corresponds to a 2x2 block in the output grid O, starting at O[2*r, 2*c].\n\n2.  Non-White Pixel Expansion: If an input pixel I[r, c] has a non-white color C (C > 0), the corresponding output 2x2 block O[2*r : 2*r+2, 2*c : 2*c+2] is filled entirely with color C.\n\n3.  White Pixel Transformation (Hypothesized Rule): If an input pixel I[r, c] is white (color 0), its transformation depends on its cardinal neighbours in the input grid:\n    a.  If all existing cardinal neighbours (up, down, left, right) of I[r, c] are also white (0), the output 2x2 block becomes a diagonal blue pattern: [[1, 0], [0, 1]].\n    b.  If any existing cardinal neighbour of I[r, c] is non-white (> 0), the output 2x2 block remains entirely white: [[0, 0], [0, 0]].\n\nNote: Extensive analysis of the training examples indicates that Rule 3, as stated, does not perfectly capture the transformation logic for all white pixels. There are cases where white pixels with all-white cardinal neighbours result in a white output block, and cases where white pixels with non-white cardinal neighbours result in the blue pattern. This implementation uses the hypothesized rule (Rule 3) but acknowledges its known limitations based on the training data. The true condition determining the white pixel transformation remains unidentified.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the described scaling and pattern replacement transformation.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed output grid based on the hypothesized rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to a NumPy array for efficient access and calculations\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    input_height, input_width = input_np.shape\n\n    # Initialize the output grid with doubled dimensions, filled with white (0)\n    output_height = 2 * input_height\n    output_width = 2 * input_width\n    output_np = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)\n\n    # Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the input grid\n    for r in range(input_height):\n        for c in range(input_width):\n            input_color = input_np[r, c]\n\n            # Calculate the top-left coordinates (out_r, out_c) for the 2x2 block in the output grid\n            out_r = 2 * r\n            out_c = 2 * c\n\n            # Apply Rule 2: Non-White Pixel Expansion\n            if input_color > 0:\n                # Define the slices for the 2x2 block, ensuring they don't exceed output bounds\n                row_slice = slice(out_r, min(out_r + 2, output_height))\n                col_slice = slice(out_c, min(out_c + 2, output_width))\n                # Fill the block with the input color\n                output_np[row_slice, col_slice] = input_color\n\n            # Apply Rule 3: White Pixel Transformation (Hypothesized)\n            else: # input_color == 0\n                # Check the cardinal neighbours based on the hypothesized rule\n                all_cardinal_neighbours_white = True\n                \n                # Define relative coordinates for cardinal neighbours\n                neighbour_deltas = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] # Up, Down, Left, Right\n\n                # Check each potential neighbour\n                for dr, dc in neighbour_deltas:\n                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                    # Check if the neighbour coordinates are within the input grid bounds\n                    if 0 <= nr < input_height and 0 <= nc < input_width:\n                        # If a valid neighbour is non-white, the condition fails\n                        if input_np[nr, nc] > 0:\n                            all_cardinal_neighbours_white = False\n                            break # Stop checking neighbours as soon as one non-white is found\n                \n                # Apply sub-rule 3a: Generate blue pattern if all neighbours were white\n                if all_cardinal_neighbours_white:\n                    # Set the diagonal blue pattern, checking output boundaries\n                    if out_r < output_height and out_c < output_width:\n                         output_np[out_r, out_c] = 1      # Top-left blue\n                    if out_r + 1 < output_height and out_c + 1 < output_width:\n                        output_np[out_r + 1, out_c + 1] = 1  # Bottom-right blue\n                    # The other cells (top-right, bottom-left) remain 0 from initialization.\n                \n                # Apply sub-rule 3b: If any neighbour was non-white, the block remains white.\n                # No explicit action is needed as the output grid was initialized with zeros.\n\n    # Convert the final NumPy array back to a list of lists format\n    output_grid = output_np.tolist()\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
