"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:

1.  Grid Scaling: The output grid dimensions are twice the height (2H) and twice the width (2W) of the input grid (H x W). Each input pixel I[r, c] corresponds to a 2x2 block in the output grid O, starting at O[2*r, 2*c].

2.  Non-White Pixel Expansion: If an input pixel I[r, c] has a non-white color C (C > 0), the corresponding output 2x2 block O[2*r : 2*r+2, 2*c : 2*c+2] is filled entirely with color C.

3.  White Pixel Transformation (Hypothesized Rule): If an input pixel I[r, c] is white (color 0), its transformation depends on its cardinal neighbours in the input grid:
    a.  If all existing cardinal neighbours (up, down, left, right) of I[r, c] are also white (0), the output 2x2 block becomes a diagonal blue pattern: [[1, 0], [0, 1]].
    b.  If any existing cardinal neighbour of I[r, c] is non-white (> 0), the output 2x2 block remains entirely white: [[0, 0], [0, 0]].

Note: Extensive analysis of the training examples indicates that Rule 3, as stated, does not perfectly capture the transformation logic for all white pixels. There are cases where white pixels with all-white cardinal neighbours result in a white output block, and cases where white pixels with non-white cardinal neighbours result in the blue pattern. This implementation uses the hypothesized rule (Rule 3) but acknowledges its known limitations based on the training data. The true condition determining the white pixel transformation remains unidentified.
