**Perception:**

The core transformation involves scaling the input grid by a factor of two. Each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a 2x2 block in the output grid. The content of this 2x2 block is determined by the color of the original input pixel and its immediate orthogonal neighbours.

1.  **Scaling:** The output grid is twice the height and twice the width of the input grid.
2.  **Non-White Pixels:** If an input pixel has a color other than white (0), the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid is filled entirely with that color.
3.  **White Pixels:** If an input pixel is white (0), the corresponding 2x2 output block's content depends on the input pixel's cardinal neighbours (up, down, left, right).
    *   If all existing cardinal neighbours of the white input pixel are also white, the output block becomes a diagonal pattern: blue (1) top-left, white (0) top-right, white (0) bottom-left, blue (1) bottom-right.
    *   If any existing cardinal neighbour of the white input pixel is non-white, the output block remains entirely white (0).

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input Grid:
  - object: grid
  - properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W
      - pixels: Located at (r, c), have a color C (0-9, 0 is white)

Output Grid:
  - object: grid
  - properties:
      - height: 2H
      - width: 2W
      - pixels: Colors derived from input grid

Transformation Rules:
  - rule: Scaling
    - relationship: Each input pixel (r, c) maps to a 2x2 output block starting at (2*r, 2*c).
  - rule: Pattern Replacement based on Input Color and Neighbourhood
    - input_pixel: color C at (r, c)
    - output_block: 2x2 block starting at (2*r, 2*c)
    - condition: If C is not white (C > 0)
      - action: Fill output_block with color C. -> [[C, C], [C, C]]
    - condition: If C is white (C == 0)
      - sub_condition: Check cardinal neighbours (up, down, left, right) of input pixel (r, c). Are all neighbours that exist within the grid bounds also white (0)?
        - if True: Set output_block to [[blue(1), white(0)], [white(0), blue(1)]].
        - if False: Set output_block to [[white(0), white(0)], [white(0), white(0)]].
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an `output_grid` with dimensions `2 * input_height` by `2 * input_width`, filling it with the white color (0).
2.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the `input_grid`.
3.  Let `input_color` be the color of the cell `(r, c)`.
4.  Determine the top-left coordinates `(out_r, out_c)` of the corresponding 2x2 block in the `output_grid`, where `out_r = 2 * r` and `out_c = 2 * c`.
5.  If `input_color` is not white (`input_color > 0`):
    a.  Set the color of the four cells in the `output_grid` block starting at `(out_r, out_c)` (i.e., `(out_r, out_c)`, `(out_r+1, out_c)`, `(out_r, out_c+1)`, `(out_r+1, out_c+1)`) to `input_color`.
6.  If `input_color` is white (`input_color == 0`):
    a.  Assume initially that the condition for the special blue pattern is `True`.
    b.  Check the neighbor above: If `r > 0` and the color of `input_grid[r-1, c]` is not white, set the condition to `False`.
    c.  Check the neighbor below: If `r < input_height - 1` and the color of `input_grid[r+1, c]` is not white, set the condition to `False`.
    d.  Check the neighbor left: If `c > 0` and the color of `input_grid[r, c-1]` is not white, set the condition to `False`.
    e.  Check the neighbor right: If `c < input_width - 1` and the color of `input_grid[r, c+1]` is not white, set the condition to `False`.
    f.  If the condition remains `True` after checking all neighbours:
        i.  Set `output_grid[out_r, out_c]` to blue (1).
        ii. Set `output_grid[out_r+1, out_c+1]` to blue (1).
    g.  (Otherwise, if the condition became `False`, the block remains white (0) as initialized).
7.  Return the final `output_grid`.

**Assessment and Strategy**

The initial transformation rule, derived from `train_1`, correctly identified the 2x scaling and the handling of non-white input pixels. However, the rule for transforming white (0) input pixels was incorrect. The initial hypothesis was: "If a white input pixel has *only* white cardinal neighbours, transform it into a 2x2 diagonal blue pattern `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`; otherwise, transform it into a 2x2 white block `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`."

Testing this rule against `train_2` and `train_3` revealed discrepancies. Specifically:
*   In `train_2`, input pixel (2,3) has only white cardinal neighbours, but the expected output block is white, not the blue pattern. The code incorrectly produced the blue pattern. Conversely, input pixels (3,2) and (4,1) have non-white cardinal neighbours, but the expected output is the blue pattern, while the code produced a white block.
*   In `train_3`, numerous white input pixels like (0,0), (0,1), (1,2) have only white cardinal neighbours, but the expected output is a white block, while the code incorrectly produced the blue pattern.

This indicates the condition determining whether a white input pixel becomes a blue pattern or a white block is more complex than just checking cardinal neighbours. The errors suggest the rule needs to incorporate information about diagonal neighbours or the broader context.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-analyze White Pixel Transformation:** Focus on the white input pixels in all three examples. Compare those that result in a white output block versus those resulting in the blue pattern block.
2.  **Identify Distinguishing Features:** Determine the properties (e.g., adjacency to non-white pixels in the 8-neighbourhood, configuration of the 2x2 input block) that differentiate the two cases for white input pixels.
3.  **Formulate New Hypothesis:** Develop a revised rule for white pixels based on these features. A promising hypothesis is: A white pixel transforms to the blue pattern if and only if it is adjacent (cardinally or diagonally) to *any* non-white pixel in the input grid. Otherwise, it transforms to the white block. *Self-correction: Testing this hypothesis against Example 1 showed it failed for input pixels (0,1) and (1,0), predicting Blue where White was expected. The correct rule remains elusive based solely on local neighbourhood checks tested so far.*
4.  **Refine NL Program and Facts:** Update the documentation to reflect the most accurate understanding, acknowledging the difficulty in precisely defining the white pixel rule but using the best hypothesis found. The structure (scaling, non-white pixel handling) remains the same. The core issue is the exact condition for the white -> blue pattern transformation.

**Metrics**

Metrics generation will focus on comparing the neighbourhood of white pixels leading to the two different output patterns across all examples.

**Findings from Metrics:**

The code execution analyzes white input pixels based on the *expected* output pattern.

*   **White -> Blue Pattern:** These pixels sometimes have only white cardinal neighbours (`All Cardinal White: True`) and sometimes not. They sometimes have a non-white neighbour in the Moore neighbourhood (`Has Non-White Moore Neighbor: True`) and sometimes not (e.g., Ex2 (3,3), Ex2 (4,4), Ex3 (4,3), Ex3 (5,4)).
*   **White -> White Block:** These pixels sometimes have only white cardinal neighbours and sometimes not. They sometimes have a non-white Moore neighbour and sometimes not.

Crucially, the condition `All Cardinal White: True` does **not** reliably predict the Blue pattern (as seen in Ex2 (2,3), Ex3 (0,0) etc.). The condition `Has Non-White Moore Neighbor: True` also does **not** reliably predict the Blue pattern (as seen in Ex1 (0,1), Ex2 (0,1), Ex3 (0,4) etc. which produce White blocks).

Furthermore, there are cases like Ex2 (3,3) and Ex2 (4,4) where the Blue pattern is expected, yet *all* neighbours (cardinal and diagonal) are white. This contradicts simple neighbourhood adjacency rules.

**Conclusion:** The rule governing the transformation of white pixels is not based solely on the color of adjacent neighbours (cardinal or Moore). The initial hypothesis (blue if all cardinal neighbours are white) and subsequent variations tested are insufficient. There might be a non-local rule, a dependency on the specific configuration of neighbours, or a different principle at play. Given the analysis, the most robust parts of the initial perception are the 2x scaling and the direct colour expansion for non-white pixels. The white pixel rule requires further insight.

      - pixels: Located at (r, c), have a color C (0=white, 1-9 non-white)

Output Grid:
  - object: grid
  - properties:
      - height: 2H
      - width: 2W
      - pixels: Colors derived from input grid based on 2x2 blocks

Transformation Rules:
  - rule: Scaling
    - relationship: Each input pixel (r, c) maps to a 2x2 output block starting at (2*r, 2*c).
  - rule: Pattern Replacement based on Input Color
    - input_pixel: color C at (r, c)
    - output_block: 2x2 block starting at (2*r, 2*c)
    - condition: If C is non-white (C > 0)
      - action: Fill output_block with color C. -> [[C, C], [C, C]]
    - condition: If C is white (C == 0)
      - sub_condition: Check unknown property P(r, c) related to the input pixel's context (neighbourhood, position, etc.).
        - if P(r, c) is True: Set output_block to [[blue(1), white(0)], [white(0), blue(1)]].
        - if P(r, c) is False: Set output_block to [[white(0), white(0)], [white(0), white(0)]].
      - observation: The property P(r,c) is not simply whether all cardinal neighbours are white, nor whether any Moore neighbour is non-white. P(r,c) is true for some white pixels completely surrounded by white (e.g., Ex2 (3,3)), and false for others (e.g., Ex2 (2,3)).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an `output_grid` with dimensions `2 * input_height` by `2 * input_width`, filling it with the white color (0).
2.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the `input_grid`.
3.  Let `input_color` be the color of the cell `(r, c)`.
4.  Determine the top-left coordinates `(out_r, out_c)` of the corresponding 2x2 block in the `output_grid`, where `out_r = 2 * r` and `out_c = 2 * c`.
5.  If `input_color` is not white (`input_color > 0`):
    a.  Set the color of the four cells in the `output_grid` block starting at `(out_r, out_c)` (i.e., `(out_r, out_c)`, `(out_r+1, out_c)`, `(out_r, out_c+1)`, `(out_r+1, out_c+1)`) to `input_color`.
6.  If `input_color` is white (`input_color == 0`):
    a.  **Determine if the condition for the blue diagonal pattern is met for the input pixel (r, c).** (Note: The exact condition is currently unclear but is not simply based on cardinal or Moore neighbourhood checks.)
    b.  **If the condition is met:**
        i.  Set `output_grid[out_r, out_c]` to blue (1).
        ii. Set `output_grid[out_r + 1, out_c + 1]` to blue (1).
        iii. Set `output_grid[out_r, out_c + 1]` to white (0).
        iv. Set `output_grid[out_r + 1, out_c]` to white (0).
    c.  **If the condition is not met:**
        i.  Set the four cells in the `output_grid` block starting at `(out_r, out_c)` to white (0) (they are already initialized to 0, so no action is needed unless the initialization changes).
7.  Return the final `output_grid`.
