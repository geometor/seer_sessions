Input Grid:
  - object: grid
  - properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W
      - pixels: Located at (r, c), have a color C (0=white, 1-9 non-white)

Output Grid:
  - object: grid
  - properties:
      - height: 2H
      - width: 2W
      - pixels: Colors derived from input grid based on 2x2 blocks

Transformation Rules:
  - rule: Scaling
    - relationship: The output grid dimensions are 2H x 2W.
    - relationship: Each input pixel (r, c) conceptually maps to a 2x2 output block starting at (2*r, 2*c).
  - rule: Non-White Pixel Expansion
    - condition: Input pixel I[r, c] has color C > 0.
    - action: The corresponding output 2x2 block O[2*r : 2*r+2, 2*c : 2*c+2] is filled with color C, i.e., [[C, C], [C, C]].
  - rule: White Pixel Transformation
    - condition: Input pixel I[r, c] has color 0 (white).
    - action: The corresponding output 2x2 block O[2*r : 2*r+2, 2*c : 2*c+2] becomes either:
        - Pattern A: [[1, 0], [0, 1]] (Diagonal Blue)
        - Pattern B: [[0, 0], [0, 0]] (White Block)
    - unresolved_condition: The specific condition P(r, c) determining whether Pattern A or Pattern B is generated is NOT simply dependent on whether all Cardinal neighbours are white, nor whether all Moore neighbours are white. The exact mechanism is currently unidentified. P(r, c) is true (produces Blue) for some white pixels surrounded only by white, and false (produces White) for others.
