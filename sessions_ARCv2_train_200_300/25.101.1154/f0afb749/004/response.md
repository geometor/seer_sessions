**Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis, based primarily on `train_1`, led to a transformation rule where the output grid is scaled 2x, non-white pixels expand to fill their corresponding 2x2 block, and white pixels transform based on their cardinal neighbours: becoming a diagonal blue pattern `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]` if all cardinal neighbours are white, and a white block `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]` otherwise.

Testing this rule (implemented in the provided Python code) against `train_2` and `train_3` revealed significant discrepancies, as shown by the non-zero `Pixels Off` counts and `Match: False` results. The core issue lies in the rule governing the transformation of white input pixels. The simple condition based on cardinal neighbours fails in numerous cases across `train_2` and `train_3`. Some white pixels with all-white cardinal neighbours produce white blocks (contrary to the rule), and some white pixels with non-white cardinal neighbours produce the blue pattern (also contrary to the rule).

Further analysis using Moore neighbourhoods (including diagonals) also failed to find a consistent local rule. White pixels completely surrounded by other white pixels (in their 3x3 neighbourhood) can result in *either* the blue pattern or a white block, indicating the determining factor is not solely the immediate neighbourhood's color composition.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Confirm Core Logic:** The 2x scaling and the expansion of non-white pixels appear consistent across all examples and should be retained.
2.  **Isolate White Pixel Rule:** The primary challenge is to identify the correct condition `P(r, c)` that determines whether a white input pixel `I[r, c]` results in the blue pattern `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]` or the white block `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`.
3.  **Re-evaluate Assumptions:** Since simple local neighbourhood rules (Cardinal, Moore) failed, consider other possibilities:
    *   Is the rule based on a larger pattern (e.g., checkerboard, relative position)?
    *   Does it depend on the configuration/pattern within a 2x2 input block?
    *   Is there a concept of "influence" or "distance" from non-white pixels that wasn't captured correctly?
    *   Could the transformation happen in stages, where the initial expansion influences subsequent steps? (Hypothesis tested in thought process, failed).
4.  **Focus on Failing Cases:** Systematically list the input white pixels where the initial rule failed and compare their contexts (neighbours, position, surrounding patterns) to find a distinguishing feature.
5.  **Metrics:** Use code execution to gather data on various properties of the white pixels and their neighbourhoods, comparing those that lead to the blue pattern versus the white block, specifically focusing on the cases where the initial rule failed.

**Metrics Generation**

The following code re-analyzes the white input pixels based on the *provided expected outputs*, focusing on the relationship between the input pixel's neighbourhood (Cardinal and Moore) and the resulting output pattern (Blue or White). This confirms the failure of simple neighbourhood rules.

**Metrics Findings:**
The metrics confirm the failure of the simple cardinal neighbour rule:
*   `(!) Blue pattern despite non-white Cardinal neighbour(s)` occurred in Ex2 for `(3, 2)` and `(4, 1)`.
*   `(!) White block despite all Cardinal neighbours being white` occurred frequently in Ex2 and Ex3.

The Moore neighbourhood analysis (`All Moore White?`) also fails to provide a clear separation:
*   There are Blue patterns where all Moore neighbours are white (e.g., Ex2 `(1,4), (2,0), (2,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)`; Ex3 `(4,3), (5,4)`).
*   There are White blocks where all Moore neighbours are white (e.g., Ex2 `(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,0)`; Ex3 many cases).

**Conclusion:** The rule governing the white pixel transformation is not determined solely by the colour values within the immediate Cardinal or Moore neighbourhood. The mechanism remains unidentified based on this local analysis.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Input Grid:
  - object: grid
  - properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W
      - pixels: Located at (r, c), have a color C (0=white, 1-9 non-white)

Output Grid:
  - object: grid
  - properties:
      - height: 2H
      - width: 2W
      - pixels: Colors derived from input grid based on 2x2 blocks

Transformation Rules:
  - rule: Scaling
    - relationship: The output grid dimensions are 2H x 2W.
    - relationship: Each input pixel (r, c) conceptually maps to a 2x2 output block starting at (2*r, 2*c).
  - rule: Non-White Pixel Expansion
    - condition: Input pixel I[r, c] has color C > 0.
    - action: The corresponding output 2x2 block O[2*r : 2*r+2, 2*c : 2*c+2] is filled with color C, i.e., [[C, C], [C, C]].
  - rule: White Pixel Transformation
    - condition: Input pixel I[r, c] has color 0 (white).
    - action: The corresponding output 2x2 block O[2*r : 2*r+2, 2*c : 2*c+2] becomes either:
        - Pattern A: [[1, 0], [0, 1]] (Diagonal Blue)
        - Pattern B: [[0, 0], [0, 0]] (White Block)
    - unresolved_condition: The specific condition P(r, c) determining whether Pattern A or Pattern B is generated is NOT simply dependent on whether all Cardinal neighbours are white, nor whether all Moore neighbours are white. The exact mechanism is currently unidentified. P(r, c) is true (produces Blue) for some white pixels surrounded only by white, and false (produces White) for others.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the dimensions of the input grid: `H` (height) and `W` (width).
2.  Initialize an output grid `O` with dimensions `2 * H` by `2 * W`, filling it entirely with the white color (0).
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid `I` from `r = 0` to `H-1` and `c = 0` to `W-1`.
4.  Get the color `C = I[r, c]`.
5.  **If `C` is non-white (`C > 0`):**
    a.  Calculate the top-left coordinates of the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid: `out_r = 2 * r`, `out_c = 2 * c`.
    b.  Fill the 2x2 block in the output grid `O` starting at `(out_r, out_c)` with the color `C`. That is, set `O[out_r, out_c]`, `O[out_r+1, out_c]`, `O[out_r, out_c+1]`, and `O[out_r+1, out_c+1]` to `C`.
6.  **If `C` is white (`C == 0`):**
    a.  Calculate the top-left coordinates of the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid: `out_r = 2 * r`, `out_c = 2 * c`.
    b.  **Determine if the condition `P(r, c)` for generating the diagonal blue pattern `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]` is met.** (Note: The precise nature of condition `P(r, c)` is currently unknown, but it is *not* simply whether all cardinal or Moore neighbours are white.)
    c.  **If condition `P(r, c)` is met:**
        i.  Set `O[out_r, out_c]` to blue (1).
        ii. Set `O[out_r+1, out_c+1]` to blue (1).
        iii. Ensure `O[out_r, out_c+1]` and `O[out_r+1, out_c]` are white (0) (they should be from initialization unless overwritten by a neighbouring non-white pixel's expansion; this step might need careful implementation depending on iteration order or if a final pass is used).
    d.  **If condition `P(r, c)` is NOT met:**
        i.  Ensure the 2x2 block in `O` starting at `(out_r, out_c)` remains entirely white (0). (This is the default initialization state, so potentially no action is needed unless overwritten).
7.  Return the final output grid `O`.
