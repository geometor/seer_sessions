For each column position in the output (0 to 4), one column is chosen from the corresponding columns in the three input segments (e.g., output column 0 is chosen from input columns 0, 6, or 12).\n5.  **Selection Logic:** The core challenge is determining the rule for selecting which of the three corresponding input columns (one from each segment) becomes the output column for that position. Several hypotheses were tested (most diverse segment, column similarity, column uniformity, frequency counts, sums) but none perfectly matched all examples. The logic appears complex but revolves around comparing the triplet of columns at the same relative position within each segment.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n```"
