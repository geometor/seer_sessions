  output_composition: The output grid is formed column by column.
  column_selection_rule:
    description: >
      For each column index 'j' (from 0 to 4), compare the input columns
      at indices j, j+6, and j+12 (referred to as Col_Seg1, Col_Seg2, Col_Seg3).
      Select one of these three columns based on a specific rule to become output column 'j'.
    tested_rule:
      name: Max Sum with Max Segment Index Tie-breaker
      primary_criterion: Select the column with the maximum sum of pixel values.
      tie_breaker_1: If sum is tied, select the column from the segment with the highest index (Segment 3 > Segment 2 > Segment 1).
      status: Partially Correct
      correct_examples: [Train 1]
      incorrect_examples:
        - Train 2: Fails for output columns 3 and 4.
        - Train 3: Fails for output column 3.
    observation: >
      Simple statistical rules (max/min sum, max/min unique colors, max frequency)
      with simple tie-breakers do not consistently predict the correct column
      across all training examples. The correct rule is likely more complex or
      context-dependent. The 'Max Sum' rule is documented as the current best, albeit incomplete, hypothesis.
