      orientation: vertical
      location: columns 5 and 11 (0-based indices)

      description: Input is divided by separators into three logical 5x5 segments.

transformation:
  type: column_selection
  input_source: Corresponding columns from the three segments for each output column position.
  output_composition: The output grid (5x5) is formed column by column (index j from 0 to 4).
  column_selection_rule:
    description: >
      For each output column index 'j', compare the input columns
      at indices j (Segment 0), j+6 (Segment 1), and j+12 (Segment 2).
      Select one of these three columns based on a specific rule to become output column 'j'.
    hypothesized_rule:
      name: Max Sum with Max Segment Index Tie-breaker
      primary_criterion: Select the column with the maximum sum of pixel values.
      tie_breaker: If sums are tied, select the column from the segment with the highest index (Prefer 2 > 1 > 0).
      status: Partially Correct - Best simple rule found, but incorrect on specific cases.

          expected_choice: Segment 2 (Sum 17)
        - example: Train 3
          output_column_index: 3
          candidates_sums: [29, 34, 30] # Seg 0, Seg 1, Seg 2
          rule_choice: Segment 1 (Sum 34)
          expected_choice: Segment 2 (Sum 30)
    observation: >
      Simple statistical rules fail to generalize. The correct rule might involve conditions not tested (e.g., minimum sum in specific cases, second highest sum, other properties) or be dependent on the column index 'j'.
