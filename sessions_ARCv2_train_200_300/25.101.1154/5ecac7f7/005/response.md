Transformation Rule:

1.  **Identify Separators:** Locate the vertical columns in the 5x17 input grid that consist entirely of 'magenta' (6) pixels. These are expected at column indices 5 and 11.
2.  **Segment Input:** Use the separators to divide the input grid into three 5x5 segments: Segment 0 (columns 0-4), Segment 1 (columns 6-10), and Segment 2 (columns 12-16).
3.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new, empty 5x5 output grid.
4.  **Process Columns:** For each column index `j` from 0 to 4:
    a.  **Extract Candidates:** Get the column data from input column `j` (Segment 0), input column `j+6` (Segment 1), and input column `j+12` (Segment 2).
    b.  **Apply Selection Rule (Hypothesized):**
        i.  Calculate the sum of pixel values for each of the three candidate columns.
        ii. Select the column that has the maximum sum.
        iii. **Tie-breaking:** If two or more columns share the same maximum sum, select the column that came from the segment with the largest index (prefer Segment 2 over Segment 1, and Segment 1 over Segment 0).
    c.  **Assign Output Column:** Place the selected column into the `j`-th column of the output grid.
5.  **Return Output:** Return the completed 5x5 output grid.

**(Self-Correction/Caveat):** The selection rule described in step 4b is the best simple hypothesis found but is known to be incorrect for output column 3 and 4 in Training Example 2, and output column 3 in Training Example 3. The actual rule required to solve all examples appears to be more complex than this maximum sum approach.
