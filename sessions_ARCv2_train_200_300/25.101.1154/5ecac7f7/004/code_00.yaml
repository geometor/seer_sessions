transformation:
  type: column_selection
  input_source: Corresponding columns from the three segments.
  output_composition: The output grid is formed column by column (index j from 0 to 4).
  column_selection_rule:
    description: >
      For each output column index 'j', compare the input columns
      at indices j (Segment 0), j+6 (Segment 1), and j+12 (Segment 2).
      Select one of these three columns based on a specific rule to become output column 'j'.
    hypothesized_rule:
      name: Max Sum with Max Segment Index Tie-breaker
      primary_criterion: Select the column with the maximum sum of pixel values.
      tie_breaker_1: If sums are tied, select the column from the segment with the highest index (Prefer 2 > 1 > 0).
      status: Partially Correct - Best simple rule found, but incorrect on specific cases.

    observation: >
      No simple statistical rule (tested: min/max sum, min/max unique colors, min/max frequency,
      min/max most frequent color value) with simple tie-breakers (max/min sum, max/min segment index)
      consistently predicts the correct column across all training examples. The 'Max Sum' rule is the
      closest simple approximation found. The true rule likely involves more complex comparisons or
      contextual factors not captured by these basic statistics.
