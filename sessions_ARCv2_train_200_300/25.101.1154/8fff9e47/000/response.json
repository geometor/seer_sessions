Note that these factors can be different for height and width and vary between examples (2x3 for train_1, 3x2 for train_2).\n    *   Each pixel in the input grid is expanded into a rectangular block of size `scale_h` x `scale_w` in the output grid.\n    *   The color of each pixel within an output block is not simply the color of the original input pixel. Instead, it seems to be determined by sampling the color of one of the pixels in the 3x3 neighborhood (including the center pixel itself) of the corresponding input pixel.\n    *   The specific neighbor chosen for sampling appears to depend on the relative position of the output pixel within its `scale_h` x `scale_w` block.\n    *   There seems to be a fixed mapping rule that connects the relative coordinates within a block to a specific neighbor direction (e.g., North, South-West, Center, etc.).\n    *   Pixels outside the original input grid boundaries, when queried as neighbors, likely return a default color value (potentially black/0, or perhaps derived from the input). The exact mapping and default value are not immediately obvious from the single example provided.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Calculate the integer scaling factors: `scale_h = 12 / H_in` and `scale_w = 12 / W_in`.\n    3.  Create a new output grid of size 12x12, initially empty or filled with a default color (e.g., black/0).\n    4.  Iterate through each pixel of the output grid using its row `r` (from 0 to 11) and column `c` (from 0 to 11).\n    5.  For each output pixel `(r, c)`, identify the corresponding source input pixel coordinates: `i = floor(r / scale_h)` and `j = floor(c / scale_w)`.\n    6.  Determine the relative position of the output pixel within its conceptual block: `rel_r = r % scale_h` and `rel_c = c % scale_w`.\n    7.  Based on the relative position `(rel_r, rel_c)`, select a specific neighbor direction relative to the source input pixel `(i, j)`. This selection follows a predefined mapping rule associated with the block shape (`scale_h` x `scale_w`). (For example, if the block is 2x3, the mapping might associate `(rel_r=0, rel_c=0)` with the North-West neighbor, `(rel_r=1, rel_c=2)` with the East neighbor, etc. This specific mapping needs to be fully determined).\n    8.  Get the coordinates `(ni, nj)` of the selected neighbor relative to `(i, j)`.\n    9.  Check if the neighbor coordinates `(ni, nj)` are within the bounds of the input grid.\n    10. If the neighbor is within bounds, retrieve its color value `Input[ni, nj]`.\n    11. If the neighbor is out of bounds, use a default color value (e.g., black/0).\n    12. Assign the retrieved or default color value to the output grid pixel `Output[r, c]`.\n    13. After iterating through all output pixels, return the completed 12x12 output grid."
