"""
Transforms an input grid to a fixed 12x12 output grid by scaling and sampling neighbors.

Hypothesized Transformation Rule:
1.  The input grid (H_in x W_in) is scaled up to a fixed 12x12 output grid.
2.  Integer scaling factors are calculated: scale_h = 12 // H_in, scale_w = 12 // W_in. 
    The transformation requires that 12 is divisible by both H_in and W_in.
3.  Each input pixel Input[i, j] corresponds to a rectangular block of pixels 
    (size scale_h x scale_w) in the output grid, starting at Output[i*scale_h, j*scale_w].
4.  The color of an output pixel Output[r, c] within that block is determined by 
    sampling the color of a pixel in the 3x3 neighborhood (including the center) 
    of the corresponding input pixel Input[i=r//scale_h, j=c//scale_w].
5.  The specific neighbor offset (dr, dc) relative to (i, j) is hypothesized to be 
    determined by the relative position (rel_r = r % scale_h, rel_c = c % scale_w) 
    of the output pixel within its block, using the formula:
       dr = floor((rel_r + 0.5) / scale_h * 3) - 1
       dc = floor((rel_c + 0.5) / scale_w * 3) - 1
    This formula maps the relative coordinates, normalized and scaled by 3, onto the 
    3x3 neighbor grid offsets (-1, 0, 1).
6.  If the calculated neighbor coordinate (i+dr, j+dc) falls outside the bounds of the 
    input grid, a default color of 0 (black) is used.

*Self-Correction Note:* Analysis of the training examples indicates that either the 
neighbor selection formula (step 5) or the boundary handling rule (step 6), or both, 
are incorrect as implemented. The provided code represents the hypothesized mechanism 
but failed to replicate the training outputs accurately. The true mapping or boundary 
rule requires further derivation.
