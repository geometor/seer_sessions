"""
Transforms an input grid to a fixed 12x12 output grid by scaling and sampling neighbors.

The core idea is that the input grid is scaled up to 12x12 dimensions. 
Each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a rectangular block of pixels 
(size scale_h x scale_w) in the output grid. The color of an output pixel 
is determined by sampling the color of a pixel in the 3x3 neighborhood 
(including the center) of the corresponding input pixel.

The specific neighbor to sample is determined by the relative position 
of the output pixel within its block. A mathematical formula is used to 
map the relative coordinates (normalized) to the 3x3 neighbor grid offsets 
(-1, 0, 1).

If the calculated neighbor coordinate falls outside the bounds of the 
input grid, a default color (currently assumed to be 0, black) is used.

Detailed Steps:
1. Calculates integer scaling factors: scale_h = 12 / H_in, scale_w = 12 / W_in. 
   Ensures scaling factors are integers.
2. Initializes a 12x12 output grid (e.g., with zeros).
3. Iterates through each output pixel Output[r, c] (where r is row, c is column).
4. For each output pixel:
    a. Finds the corresponding source input pixel coordinates: 
       i = r // scale_h
       j = c // scale_w
    b. Finds the relative position within the scaled block: 
       rel_r = r % scale_h
       rel_c = c % scale_w
    c. Determines a neighbor offset (dr, dc) relative to the source pixel (i, j).
       This offset selects one of the 9 neighbors in the 3x3 grid around (i,j).
       The mapping uses the relative position (rel_r, rel_c) and scales it to the 3x3 grid:
         dr = floor((rel_r + 0.5) / scale_h * 3) - 1
         dc = floor((rel_c + 0.5) / scale_w * 3) - 1
       *NOTE*: Analysis of the examples suggests this specific formula might be incorrect, 
               but it represents the hypothesized mechanism. The true mapping might differ.
    d. Calculates the target neighbor coordinates: 
       ni = i + dr
       nj = j + dc
    e. Retrieves the color from the input grid at Input[ni, nj].
    f. If the neighbor coordinate (ni, nj) is outside the input grid bounds 
       (ni < 0, ni >= H_in, nj < 0, or nj >= W_in), a default color is used.
       *NOTE*: The rule for this default color is uncertain based on example analysis. 
               A value of 0 (black) is used as a placeholder.
    g. Assigns the retrieved or default color to the output grid pixel Output[r, c].
5. Returns the completed 12x12 output grid.
