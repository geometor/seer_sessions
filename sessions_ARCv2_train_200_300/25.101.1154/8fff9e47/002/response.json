            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous attempt assumed a specific mathematical formula to map the relative position within a scaled block to a 3x3 neighbor offset. The code correctly implemented this formula and the neighbor sampling logic (using 0/black for out-of-bounds). However, the comparison with the expected outputs clearly shows that this specific formula for neighbor selection is incorrect. The generated outputs selected neighbor colors based on the formula, which did not match the target patterns.\n\nThe core concept of scaling the input grid to 12x12 and determining each output pixel's color based on the corresponding input pixel's neighborhood seems structurally plausible, but the rule linking the relative position `(rel_r, rel_c)` within the scaled block to the specific neighbor offset `(dr, dc)` is different from the one hypothesized. Additionally, the handling of out-of-bounds neighbors (currently returning 0/black) might be incorrect, as unexpected colors (like magenta/6 in example 1) appear in the output where neighbors are out of bounds.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Acknowledge Incorrect Hypothesis:** Explicitly state that the formula `dr = floor((rel_r + 0.5) / scale_h * 3) - 1` (and similarly for `dc`) for selecting neighbors is wrong.\n2.  **Retain Core Structure:** Maintain the understanding that the input is scaled, and each output pixel `(r, c)` corresponds to an input pixel `(i, j)` and a relative position `(rel_r, rel_c)`. The output color is determined by sampling *some* neighbor `Input[i+dr, j+dc]`.\n3.  **Define Unknown Mapping:** State that the mapping from `(rel_r, rel_c)` to the neighbor offset `(dr, dc)` is fixed for a given block shape (`scale_h` x `scale_w`) but needs to be determined by analyzing the examples.\n4.  **Investigate Boundary Handling:** Re-evaluate how out-of-bounds neighbors are treated. The default might not be 0/black. It could be the center pixel's color, a specific default color, or something more complex. The appearance of unexpected colors like '6' needs explanation.\n5.  **Refine YAML and Program:** Update the descriptions to reflect this revised understanding, highlighting the unknown mapping and boundary handling as key areas for further investigation.\n\n## Metrics\n\n"
