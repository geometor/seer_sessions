*   **Perception:**
    *   The task transforms a small input grid into a larger, fixed-size output grid (12x12).
    *   The transformation appears to involve scaling the input grid to fit the 12x12 output dimensions.
    *   The scaling factors are determined by the input grid's dimensions: `scale_h = 12 / H_in`, `scale_w = 12 / W_in`. Note that these factors can be different for height and width and vary between examples (2x3 for train_1, 3x2 for train_2).
    *   Each pixel in the input grid is expanded into a rectangular block of size `scale_h` x `scale_w` in the output grid.
    *   The color of each pixel within an output block is not simply the color of the original input pixel. Instead, it seems to be determined by sampling the color of one of the pixels in the 3x3 neighborhood (including the center pixel itself) of the corresponding input pixel.
    *   The specific neighbor chosen for sampling appears to depend on the relative position of the output pixel within its `scale_h` x `scale_w` block.
    *   There seems to be a fixed mapping rule that connects the relative coordinates within a block to a specific neighbor direction (e.g., North, South-West, Center, etc.).
    *   Pixels outside the original input grid boundaries, when queried as neighbors, likely return a default color value (potentially black/0, or perhaps derived from the input). The exact mapping and default value are not immediately obvious from the single example provided.

        method: Each pixel in the output block (size scale_h x scale_w) samples the color from one neighbor (including center) of the source input pixel.
        mapping: The choice of neighbor depends on the relative position within the block. (The exact mapping rule needs further examples to confirm).
        boundary_handling: Neighbors outside the input grid return a default color (e.g., black/0, but needs confirmation).
    relationships:
      - Each input pixel Input[i, j] corresponds to an output block starting at Output[i * scale_h, j * scale_w] of size scale_h x scale_w.
      - Each output pixel Output[r, c] is determined by the input pixel Input[floor(r / scale_h), floor(c / scale_w)] and its neighbors, based on the relative position (r % scale_h, c % scale_w).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the height (`H_in`) and width (`W_in`) of the input grid.
    2.  Calculate the integer scaling factors: `scale_h = 12 / H_in` and `scale_w = 12 / W_in`.
    3.  Create a new output grid of size 12x12, initially empty or filled with a default color (e.g., black/0).
    4.  Iterate through each pixel of the output grid using its row `r` (from 0 to 11) and column `c` (from 0 to 11).
    5.  For each output pixel `(r, c)`, identify the corresponding source input pixel coordinates: `i = floor(r / scale_h)` and `j = floor(c / scale_w)`.
    6.  Determine the relative position of the output pixel within its conceptual block: `rel_r = r % scale_h` and `rel_c = c % scale_w`.
    7.  Based on the relative position `(rel_r, rel_c)`, select a specific neighbor direction relative to the source input pixel `(i, j)`. This selection follows a predefined mapping rule associated with the block shape (`scale_h` x `scale_w`). (For example, if the block is 2x3, the mapping might associate `(rel_r=0, rel_c=0)` with the North-West neighbor, `(rel_r=1, rel_c=2)` with the East neighbor, etc. This specific mapping needs to be fully determined).
    8.  Get the coordinates `(ni, nj)` of the selected neighbor relative to `(i, j)`.
    9.  Check if the neighbor coordinates `(ni, nj)` are within the bounds of the input grid.
    10. If the neighbor is within bounds, retrieve its color value `Input[ni, nj]`.
    11. If the neighbor is out of bounds, use a default color value (e.g., black/0).
    12. Assign the retrieved or default color value to the output grid pixel `Output[r, c]`.
    13. After iterating through all output pixels, return the completed 12x12 output grid.

The transformation scales an input grid of size H_in x W_in to a fixed output grid of size 12x12.
The scaling factors are determined by integer division: scale_h = 12 / H_in and scale_w = 12 / W_in.
Each pixel Input[i, j] in the input grid corresponds to a block of size scale_h x scale_w in the output grid, starting at Output[i * scale_h, j * scale_w].
The color of each pixel Output[r, c] within this block is determined by sampling the color of one of the pixels in the 3x3 neighborhood (including the center pixel itself) of the corresponding input pixel Input[i, j].
The specific neighbor (offset dr, dc relative to (i, j)) is chosen based on the relative position (rel_r, rel_c) of the output pixel within its scale_h x scale_w block.
The mapping from (rel_r, rel_c) to (dr, dc) is determined by mapping the relative coordinates normalized to the 0-1 range onto a 3x3 grid representing the neighbor offsets (-1, 0, 1).
Neighbors outside the input grid boundaries are treated as having a default color of 0 (black).

Specifically, the neighbor offset (dr, dc) for an output pixel Output[r, c] is calculated as follows:
1. Find the corresponding input pixel: i = floor(r / scale_h), j = floor(c / scale_w).
2. Find the relative position within the block: rel_r = r % scale_h, rel_c = c % scale_w.
3. Calculate the normalized position within the 3x3 neighborhood grid:
   dr = floor((rel_r + 0.5) / scale_h * 3) - 1
   dc = floor((rel_c + 0.5) / scale_w * 3) - 1
4. Retrieve the color from the input grid at Input[i + dr, j + dc], handling boundary conditions by returning 0 if the coordinates are out of bounds.

## General Assessment

The previous attempt assumed a specific mathematical formula to map the relative position within a scaled block to a 3x3 neighbor offset. The code correctly implemented this formula and the neighbor sampling logic (using 0/black for out-of-bounds). However, the comparison with the expected outputs clearly shows that this specific formula for neighbor selection is incorrect. The generated outputs selected neighbor colors based on the formula, which did not match the target patterns.

The core concept of scaling the input grid to 12x12 and determining each output pixel's color based on the corresponding input pixel's neighborhood seems structurally plausible, but the rule linking the relative position `(rel_r, rel_c)` within the scaled block to the specific neighbor offset `(dr, dc)` is different from the one hypothesized. Additionally, the handling of out-of-bounds neighbors (currently returning 0/black) might be incorrect, as unexpected colors (like magenta/6 in example 1) appear in the output where neighbors are out of bounds.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Acknowledge Incorrect Hypothesis:** Explicitly state that the formula `dr = floor((rel_r + 0.5) / scale_h * 3) - 1` (and similarly for `dc`) for selecting neighbors is wrong.
2.  **Retain Core Structure:** Maintain the understanding that the input is scaled, and each output pixel `(r, c)` corresponds to an input pixel `(i, j)` and a relative position `(rel_r, rel_c)`. The output color is determined by sampling *some* neighbor `Input[i+dr, j+dc]`.
3.  **Define Unknown Mapping:** State that the mapping from `(rel_r, rel_c)` to the neighbor offset `(dr, dc)` is fixed for a given block shape (`scale_h` x `scale_w`) but needs to be determined by analyzing the examples.
4.  **Investigate Boundary Handling:** Re-evaluate how out-of-bounds neighbors are treated. The default might not be 0/black. It could be the center pixel's color, a specific default color, or something more complex. The appearance of unexpected colors like '6' needs explanation.
5.  **Refine YAML and Program:** Update the descriptions to reflect this revised understanding, highlighting the unknown mapping and boundary handling as key areas for further investigation.

      method: When the selected neighbor coordinate (i+dr, j+dc) is outside the input grid bounds.

relationships:
  - Each input pixel Input[i, j] corresponds to an output block starting at Output[i * scale_h, j * scale_w] of size scale_h x scale_w.
  - Each output pixel Output[r, c] derives its color from a specific neighbor of Input[r // scale_h, c // scale_w]. The choice of neighbor depends only on (r % scale_h, c % scale_w) and the calculated (scale_h, scale_w).
observations:
  - The scaling factors (and thus block shape) differ between examples (2x3 vs 3x2).
  - The neighbor selection rule (OffsetMap) likely differs for different block shapes.
  - The appearance of colors in the output (e.g., 6/magenta) that are not present in the immediate 3x3 neighborhood of the corresponding input pixel (when using 0/black default) indicates either a different boundary handling rule or a flaw in the neighbor sampling hypothesis itself.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the height (`H_in`) and width (`W_in`) of the input grid.
2.  Calculate the integer scaling factors: `scale_h = 12 / H_in` (integer division) and `scale_w = 12 / W_in` (integer division).
3.  Create a new output grid of size 12x12.
4.  Iterate through each pixel of the output grid using its row `r` (from 0 to 11) and column `c` (from 0 to 11).
5.  For each output pixel `(r, c)`:
    a.  Identify the corresponding source input pixel coordinates: `i = r // scale_h` and `j = c // scale_w`.
    b.  Determine the relative position of the output pixel within its conceptual block: `rel_r = r % scale_h` and `rel_c = c % scale_w`.
    c.  Determine the neighbor offset `(dr, dc)` based on the relative position `(rel_r, rel_c)` and the block shape `(scale_h, scale_w)`, using a predefined mapping rule `OffsetMap[scale_h, scale_w]`. (Note: The specific mapping rule is currently unknown and needs to be derived from the examples; the previously tested mathematical formula was incorrect).
    d.  Calculate the coordinates of the target neighbor pixel: `ni = i + dr`, `nj = j + dc`.
    e.  Check if the neighbor coordinates `(ni, nj)` are within the bounds of the input grid (0 <= `ni` < `H_in` and 0 <= `nj` < `W_in`).
    f.  If the neighbor is within bounds, retrieve its color value `Input[ni, nj]`.
    g.  If the neighbor is out of bounds, assign a default color. (Note: The rule for determining this default color is currently unknown; it is not necessarily 0/black and may depend on context).
    h.  Assign the retrieved or default color value to the output grid pixel `Output[r, c]`.
6.  After iterating through all output pixels, return the completed 12x12 output grid.

"""
Transforms an input grid to a fixed 12x12 output grid by scaling and sampling neighbors.

The core idea is that the input grid is scaled up to 12x12 dimensions. 
Each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a rectangular block of pixels 
(size scale_h x scale_w) in the output grid. The color of an output pixel 
is determined by sampling the color of a pixel in the 3x3 neighborhood 
(including the center) of the corresponding input pixel.

The specific neighbor to sample is determined by the relative position 
of the output pixel within its block. A mathematical formula is used to 
map the relative coordinates (normalized) to the 3x3 neighbor grid offsets 
(-1, 0, 1).

If the calculated neighbor coordinate falls outside the bounds of the 
input grid, a default color (currently assumed to be 0, black) is used.

Detailed Steps:
1. Calculates integer scaling factors: scale_h = 12 / H_in, scale_w = 12 / W_in. 
   Ensures scaling factors are integers.
2. Initializes a 12x12 output grid (e.g., with zeros).
3. Iterates through each output pixel Output[r, c] (where r is row, c is column).
4. For each output pixel:
    a. Finds the corresponding source input pixel coordinates: 
       i = r // scale_h
       j = c // scale_w
    b. Finds the relative position within the scaled block: 
       rel_r = r % scale_h
       rel_c = c % scale_w
    c. Determines a neighbor offset (dr, dc) relative to the source pixel (i, j).
       This offset selects one of the 9 neighbors in the 3x3 grid around (i,j).
       The mapping uses the relative position (rel_r, rel_c) and scales it to the 3x3 grid:
         dr = floor((rel_r + 0.5) / scale_h * 3) - 1
         dc = floor((rel_c + 0.5) / scale_w * 3) - 1
       *NOTE*: Analysis of the examples suggests this specific formula might be incorrect, 
               but it represents the hypothesized mechanism. The true mapping might differ.
    d. Calculates the target neighbor coordinates: 
       ni = i + dr
       nj = j + dc
    e. Retrieves the color from the input grid at Input[ni, nj].
    f. If the neighbor coordinate (ni, nj) is outside the input grid bounds 
       (ni < 0, ni >= H_in, nj < 0, or nj >= W_in), a default color is used.
       *NOTE*: The rule for this default color is uncertain based on example analysis. 
               A value of 0 (black) is used as a placeholder.
    g. Assigns the retrieved or default color to the output grid pixel Output[r, c].
5. Returns the completed 12x12 output grid.

## General Assessment

The previous code attempt correctly identified the core transformation as scaling the input grid to a fixed 12x12 output size, where each input pixel corresponds to a rectangular block in the output. It also correctly identified that the color of an output pixel within a block is determined by sampling from the 3x3 neighborhood of the corresponding input pixel.

However, the specific rule implemented for *which* neighbor to sample, based on the relative position within the block (the `floor(...) - 1` formula), was incorrect, leading to complete mismatches in the pixel values for both training examples. Additionally, the assumption that out-of-bounds neighbors should default to black (0) appears incorrect, as indicated by the presence of colors like magenta (6) in the expected output near boundaries in Example 1, where the hypothesized neighbor sampling would access out-of-bounds areas.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Derive Neighbor Mapping:** Instead of assuming a mathematical formula, we must empirically derive the mapping between the relative coordinates `(rel_r, rel_c)` within a block and the required neighbor offset `(dr, dc)` relative to the source input pixel `(i, j)`. This mapping needs to be determined separately for each observed block shape (`2x3` for Example 1, `3x2` for Example 2) by comparing the expected output pixels with the 3x3 neighborhood of the corresponding input pixels.
2.  **Determine Boundary Handling Rule:** Analyze the output pixels where the derived neighbor offset `(dr, dc)` points outside the input grid `(i+dr < 0 or i+dr >= H_in or j+dc < 0 or j+dc >= W_in)`. Observe the expected color in these specific output cells to understand the correct boundary handling rule. It might be the color of the central input pixel `Input[i, j]`, a specific default color depending on the context, or another rule.
3.  **Implement Derived Rules:** Update the transformation logic to use the empirically derived mappings (potentially stored in dictionaries or lookup tables) and the discovered boundary handling rule.

    width: scale_w = 12 // W_in (integer division)
  block_shape: [scale_h, scale_w] # Varies with input dimensions (e.g., 2x3, 3x2)
  sampling:
    source: 3x3 neighborhood of the corresponding input pixel.
    method: Each output pixel Output[r, c] samples the color from one neighbor (offset dr, dc) of the source input pixel Input[i, j], where i = r // scale_h and j = c // scale_w.
    neighbor_selection:
      dependency: Determined by the relative position (rel_r = r % scale_h, rel_c = c % scale_w) within the block.
      mapping: A specific, fixed mapping `OffsetMap[block_shape](rel_r, rel_c) -> (dr, dc)` exists for each unique block shape. This mapping must be empirically derived from the examples.
    boundary_handling:
      method: Applied when the selected neighbor coordinate (i+dr, j+dc) is outside the input grid bounds.
      rule: The rule for determining the color in out-of-bounds cases is UNDETERMINED and needs to be derived from the examples. It is not simply 0/black.
relationships:
  - Each input pixel Input[i, j] corresponds conceptually to an output block starting at Output[i * scale_h, j * scale_w] of size scale_h x scale_w.
  - The color of Output[r, c] is determined by Input[i+dr, j+dc] or a boundary rule, where (dr, dc) is a function of (r % scale_h, c % scale_w) specific to the (scale_h, scale_w) block shape.
observations:
  - The scaling factors and block shapes differ between examples, requiring potentially different neighbor offset mappings (OffsetMap) for each shape.
  - The boundary handling rule needs careful examination, as the default assumption of 0/black is inconsistent with observed outputs (e.g., color 6 in Example 1).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the height (`H_in`) and width (`W_in`) of the input grid.
2.  Calculate the integer scaling factors: `scale_h = 12 // H_in` and `scale_w = 12 // W_in`. Handle cases where `H_in` or `W_in` is zero, or if 12 is not divisible by `H_in` or `W_in`, potentially returning an empty or default grid.
3.  Create a new output grid of size 12x12.
4.  Iterate through each pixel of the output grid using its row `r` (from 0 to 11) and column `c` (from 0 to 11).
5.  For each output pixel `(r, c)`:
    a.  Identify the corresponding source input pixel coordinates: `i = r // scale_h` and `j = c // scale_w`.
    b.  Determine the relative position of the output pixel within its conceptual block: `rel_r = r % scale_h` and `rel_c = c % scale_w`.
    c.  Determine the required neighbor offset `(dr, dc)` relative to the source pixel `(i, j)`. This offset is found using a predefined mapping rule that depends *only* on the relative position `(rel_r, rel_c)` and the calculated block shape `(scale_h, scale_w)`. (This mapping must be derived by analyzing the input/output examples for each distinct block shape).
    d.  Calculate the coordinates of the target neighbor pixel: `ni = i + dr`, `nj = j + dc`.
    e.  Check if the neighbor coordinates `(ni, nj)` are within the bounds of the input grid (0 <= `ni` < `H_in` and 0 <= `nj` < `W_in`).
    f.  If the neighbor is within bounds, retrieve its color value `Input[ni, nj]`.
    g.  If the neighbor is out of bounds, apply the specific boundary handling rule determined by analyzing the examples. (This rule needs to be identified - it might involve using the source pixel's color `Input[i,j]`, a fixed color, or another mechanism).
    h.  Assign the retrieved or boundary-derived color value to the output grid pixel `Output[r, c]`.
6.  After iterating through all output pixels, return the completed 12x12 output grid.

1.  The input grid (H_in x W_in) is scaled up to a fixed 12x12 output grid.
2.  Integer scaling factors are calculated: scale_h = 12 // H_in, scale_w = 12 // W_in. 
    The transformation requires that 12 is divisible by both H_in and W_in.
3.  Each input pixel Input[i, j] corresponds to a rectangular block of pixels 
    (size scale_h x scale_w) in the output grid, starting at Output[i*scale_h, j*scale_w].
4.  The color of an output pixel Output[r, c] within that block is determined by 
    sampling the color of a pixel in the 3x3 neighborhood (including the center) 
    of the corresponding input pixel Input[i=r//scale_h, j=c//scale_w].
5.  The specific neighbor offset (dr, dc) relative to (i, j) is hypothesized to be 
    determined by the relative position (rel_r = r % scale_h, rel_c = c % scale_w) 
    of the output pixel within its block, using the formula:
       dr = floor((rel_r + 0.5) / scale_h * 3) - 1
       dc = floor((rel_c + 0.5) / scale_w * 3) - 1
    This formula maps the relative coordinates, normalized and scaled by 3, onto the 
    3x3 neighbor grid offsets (-1, 0, 1).
6.  If the calculated neighbor coordinate (i+dr, j+dc) falls outside the bounds of the 
    input grid, a default color of 0 (black) is used.

*Self-Correction Note:* Analysis of the training examples indicates that either the 
neighbor selection formula (step 5) or the boundary handling rule (step 6), or both, 
are incorrect as implemented. The provided code represents the hypothesized mechanism 
but failed to replicate the training outputs accurately. The true mapping or boundary 
rule requires further derivation.

## General Assessment

The previous code attempt correctly identified the overall structure of the transformation: scaling the input grid to a fixed 12x12 output and determining each output pixel's color based on the corresponding input pixel's neighborhood. However, it failed because:

1.  **Incorrect Neighbor Selection:** The mathematical formula used to map the relative position within a scaled block `(rel_r, rel_c)` to a specific neighbor offset `(dr, dc)` was wrong.
2.  **Incorrect Boundary Handling:** The assumption that out-of-bounds neighbors default to black (0) was incorrect.

The analysis reveals that a specific, fixed mapping `OffsetMap[block_shape](rel_r, rel_c) -> (dr, dc)` exists for each unique block shape encountered (2x3 and 3x2 in the examples). Furthermore, the boundary handling rule is consistent across both examples: if the mapped neighbor coordinate `(i+dr, j+dc)` falls outside the input grid, the color of the central input pixel `Input[i, j]` should be used instead.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Implement Derived Mappings:** Store the empirically derived offset maps for the 2x3 and 3x2 block shapes.
2.  **Implement Correct Boundary Handling:** Modify the `get_neighbor_color` logic (or integrate it into the main loop) to return the central pixel's color `Input[i, j]` when the calculated neighbor `(i+dr, j+dc)` is out of bounds.
3.  **Update Descriptions:** Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately describe the derived mappings and boundary rule.

```yaml
task_type: scaling_and_mapped_neighbor_sampling
input_object:
  type: grid
  description: A grid of pixels with varying dimensions (H_in x W_in). Dimensions must be divisors of 12.
output_object:
  type: grid
  description: A grid of pixels with fixed dimensions (12x12).
transformation:
  operation: scale_and_sample_via_mapping
  scaling_factors:
    height: scale_h = 12 // H_in (integer division)
    width: scale_w = 12 // W_in (integer division)
  block_shape: [scale_h, scale_w] # Determines which offset map to use (e.g., 2x3, 3x2)
  sampling:
    source: 3x3 neighborhood of the corresponding input pixel.
    method: Each output pixel Output[r, c] samples the color from one neighbor (offset dr, dc) of the source input pixel Input[i, j], where i = r // scale_h and j = c // scale_w.
    neighbor_selection:
      dependency: Determined by the relative position (rel_r = r % scale_h, rel_c = c % scale_w) within the block.
      mapping: A specific, fixed mapping `OffsetMap[block_shape](rel_r, rel_c) -> (dr, dc)` is used, derived empirically from the examples.
        map_2x3: # For scale_h=2, scale_w=3

          (2,0): (0,-1)  # W
          (2,1): (0,1)   # E
    boundary_handling:
      method: Applied when the selected neighbor coordinate (ni = i+dr, nj = j+dc) is outside the input grid bounds (ni < 0 or ni >= H_in or nj < 0 or nj >= W_in).
      rule: Use the color of the central source input pixel, Input[i, j].
relationships:
  - Each input pixel Input[i, j] corresponds conceptually to an output block starting at Output[i * scale_h, j * scale_w] of size scale_h x scale_w.
  - The color of Output[r, c] is determined by Input[i+dr, j+dc] (if in bounds) or Input[i, j] (if out of bounds), where (dr, dc) is uniquely determined by the block shape (scale_h, scale_w) and the relative position (r % scale_h, c % scale_w) via the appropriate OffsetMap.
observations:
  - The transformation requires input dimensions to be divisors of 12.
  - Two distinct neighbor offset maps are needed for the two block shapes observed.
  - The boundary handling rule is consistent across both examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the height (`H_in`) and width (`W_in`) of the input grid.
2.  Check if `H_in` and `W_in` are greater than zero and are divisors of 12. If not, return a default 12x12 grid (e.g., all black).
3.  Calculate the integer scaling factors: `scale_h = 12 // H_in` and `scale_w = 12 // W_in`.
4.  Define or select the appropriate neighbor offset map based on the calculated block shape (`scale_h`, `scale_w`). Use `map_2x3` if `scale_h=2` and `scale_w=3`, use `map_3x2` if `scale_h=3` and `scale_w=2`. (Note: The maps are provided in the YAML facts).
5.  Create a new output grid of size 12x12.
6.  Iterate through each pixel of the output grid using its row `r` (from 0 to 11) and column `c` (from 0 to 11).
7.  For each output pixel `(r, c)`:
    a.  Identify the corresponding source input pixel coordinates: `i = r // scale_h` and `j = c // scale_w`.
    b.  Determine the relative position of the output pixel within its conceptual block: `rel_r = r % scale_h` and `rel_c = c % scale_w`.
    c.  Look up the neighbor offset `(dr, dc)` from the selected offset map using the relative position `(rel_r, rel_c)` as the key.
    d.  Calculate the coordinates of the target neighbor pixel: `ni = i + dr`, `nj = j + dc`.
    e.  Check if the neighbor coordinates `(ni, nj)` are within the bounds of the input grid (0 <= `ni` < `H_in` and 0 <= `nj` < `W_in`).
    f.  If the neighbor is within bounds, retrieve its color value `color = Input[ni, nj]`.
    g.  If the neighbor is out of bounds, retrieve the color of the central source input pixel `color = Input[i, j]`.
    h.  Assign the determined color value (`color`) to the output grid pixel `Output[r, c]`.
8.  After iterating through all output pixels, return the completed 12x12 output grid.
