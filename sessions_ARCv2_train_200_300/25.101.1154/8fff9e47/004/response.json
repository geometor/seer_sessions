            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempt correctly identified the core transformation as scaling the input grid to a fixed 12x12 output size, where each input pixel corresponds to a rectangular block in the output. It also correctly identified that the color of an output pixel within a block is determined by sampling from the 3x3 neighborhood of the corresponding input pixel.\n\nHowever, the specific rule implemented for *which* neighbor to sample, based on the relative position within the block (the `floor(...) - 1` formula), was incorrect, leading to complete mismatches in the pixel values for both training examples. Additionally, the assumption that out-of-bounds neighbors should default to black (0) appears incorrect, as indicated by the presence of colors like magenta (6) in the expected output near boundaries in Example 1, where the hypothesized neighbor sampling would access out-of-bounds areas.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Derive Neighbor Mapping:** Instead of assuming a mathematical formula, we must empirically derive the mapping between the relative coordinates `(rel_r, rel_c)` within a block and the required neighbor offset `(dr, dc)` relative to the source input pixel `(i, j)`. This mapping needs to be determined separately for each observed block shape (`2x3` for Example 1, `3x2` for Example 2) by comparing the expected output pixels with the 3x3 neighborhood of the corresponding input pixels.\n2.  **Determine Boundary Handling Rule:** Analyze the output pixels where the derived neighbor offset `(dr, dc)` points outside the input grid `(i+dr < 0 or i+dr >= H_in or j+dc < 0 or j+dc >= W_in)`. Observe the expected color in these specific output cells to understand the correct boundary handling rule. It might be the color of the central input pixel `Input[i, j]`, a specific default color depending on the context, or another rule.\n3.  **Implement Derived Rules:** Update the transformation logic to use the empirically derived mappings (potentially stored in dictionaries or lookup tables) and the discovered boundary handling rule.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe following metrics summarize the characteristics of the examples and the performance of the previous code attempt:\n\n*code_execution:*\n"
