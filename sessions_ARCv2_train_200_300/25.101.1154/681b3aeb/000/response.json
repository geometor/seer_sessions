The objects have varying shapes (L-shapes, T-shapes, squares, etc.) and are located at different positions in a larger grid (10x10 in the examples).\n2.  **Output:** The output is a smaller, square grid. The size of the output grid appears determined by the dimensions of the input objects' bounding boxes.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves extracting the two objects from the input, determining their properties (shape, color, bounding box size), and combining them onto a new grid according to specific rules.\n4.  **Objects:** The core elements are the two colored blocks (objects) identified in the input.\n5.  **Properties:** Key properties are the color of each object, its shape (pixels relative to its bounding box), and the dimensions (height, width, area) of its bounding box.\n6.  **Combination Logic:** The output grid is formed by overlaying the shapes of the two input objects. The size of the output grid is determined by the maximum dimension (height or width) found across the bounding boxes of both input objects. A precedence rule determines which object's color prevails in case of overlap, and a fill rule determines the color of background cells in the output grid.\n7.  **Precedence Rule:** A \"Winner\" object and a \"Loser\" object are determined based on their bounding box areas. If the areas differ, the object with the larger area is the Winner. If the areas are the same, the object with the lower color index is the Winner. The Winner's shape takes precedence in the overlay.\n8.  **Fill Rule:** After overlaying based on precedence (Winner's non-zero pixels overwrite Loser's pixels), any remaining background (zero) cells in the output grid are filled with the color of the Loser object.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
