**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Input:** Each input grid contains exactly two distinct contiguous objects of different colors (excluding the white background). The objects have varying shapes (L-shapes, T-shapes, squares, etc.) and are located at different positions in a larger grid (10x10 in the examples).
2.  **Output:** The output is a smaller, square grid. The size of the output grid appears determined by the dimensions of the input objects' bounding boxes.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves extracting the two objects from the input, determining their properties (shape, color, bounding box size), and combining them onto a new grid according to specific rules.
4.  **Objects:** The core elements are the two colored blocks (objects) identified in the input.
5.  **Properties:** Key properties are the color of each object, its shape (pixels relative to its bounding box), and the dimensions (height, width, area) of its bounding box.
6.  **Combination Logic:** The output grid is formed by overlaying the shapes of the two input objects. The size of the output grid is determined by the maximum dimension (height or width) found across the bounding boxes of both input objects. A precedence rule determines which object's color prevails in case of overlap, and a fill rule determines the color of background cells in the output grid.
7.  **Precedence Rule:** A "Winner" object and a "Loser" object are determined based on their bounding box areas. If the areas differ, the object with the larger area is the Winner. If the areas are the same, the object with the lower color index is the Winner. The Winner's shape takes precedence in the overlay.
8.  **Fill Rule:** After overlaying based on precedence (Winner's non-zero pixels overwrite Loser's pixels), any remaining background (zero) cells in the output grid are filled with the color of the Loser object.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
task_description: Overlay two shapes based on priority, filling the background.

definitions:
  object: A contiguous block of non-white pixels of the same color.
  bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of an object.
  bbox_content: The 2D array of pixels within the bounding box, preserving relative positions.
  bbox_area: height * width of the bounding box.
  max_dimension: The maximum of height and width of a bounding box.

input_features:
  grid_size: Variable (e.g., 10x10).
  background_color: White (0).
  objects: Exactly two distinct colored objects per input grid.

output_features:
  grid_size: Square grid (S x S).
  size_determination: S = max(object1.max_dimension, object2.max_dimension).
  content: Combination of the two input object shapes based on specific rules.

transformation_steps:
  1. Identify the two colored objects (O1, O2) in the input grid.
  2. For each object, determine its color (C1, C2), bounding_box (B1, B2), and bbox_content (Shape1, Shape2). Calculate bbox_area (A1, A2) and max_dimension (S1, S2).
  3. Determine the output grid dimension: S = max(S1, S2).
  4. Determine the Winner (W) and Loser (L) objects:
     - If A1 != A2: Winner = object with larger Area.
     - If A1 == A2: Winner = object with lower Color index.
  5. Pad Winner's shape (ShapeW) and Loser's shape (ShapeL) to S x S grids (PW, PL).
  6. Create the initial overlay grid (Overlay) of size S x S:
     - For each cell (r, c):
       - Overlay[r, c] = PW[r, c] if PW[r, c] != 0 else PL[r, c]
  7. Create the final output grid (Output) by filling background:
     - For each cell (r, c):
       - Output[r, c] = Overlay[r, c] if Overlay[r, c] != 0 else ColorL (Loser's color).

relationships:
  - Output grid size depends on the maximum dimension of the input objects' bounding boxes.
  - Pixel colors in the output depend on the colors of both input objects.
  - Pixel placement depends on the relative shapes within the bounding boxes.
  - Precedence during overlay depends on bounding box area and color index.
  - Background color in the output depends on the color of the "Loser" object.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Find the two distinct colored objects in the input grid.
2.  For each object, find its color, calculate its bounding box, and extract the shape (content) within that bounding box. Also, calculate the area (height * width) and the maximum dimension (max(height, width)) of the bounding box.
3.  Determine the size `S` for the square output grid by taking the maximum of the two objects' maximum dimensions.
4.  Compare the bounding box areas of the two objects.
    *   If the areas are different, designate the object with the larger area as the "Winner" and the other as the "Loser".
    *   If the areas are the same, designate the object with the lower color index as the "Winner" and the other as the "Loser".
5.  Create an intermediate square grid of size `S x S`.
6.  Place the Winner's shape onto the intermediate grid at the top-left corner (relative position 0,0).
7.  Place the Loser's shape onto the intermediate grid at the top-left corner. If a cell is already colored by the Winner's shape, it retains the Winner's color; otherwise (if the cell was background), it takes the Loser's color.
8.  Create the final output grid by taking the intermediate grid from step 7. Find any cells that are still background-colored (value 0) and fill them with the Loser object's color.
9.  Return the final output grid.
