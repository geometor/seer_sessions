task_type: object_manipulation
components:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    properties: static, fills vacated space
  - role: boundary
    color: red (2)
    shape: solid line (row or column)
    properties: static, immovable, defines movement direction
  - role: movable_objects
    color: any color except white (0) and red (2)
    shape: contiguous blocks of single color
    properties: mobile
actions:
  - name: identify_boundary
    input: input_grid
    output: red line coordinates, orientation (horizontal/vertical), position (top/bottom/left/right)
  - name: determine_movement_direction
    input: boundary position and orientation
    output: direction vector (e.g., down, up, left, right) - always towards the boundary
  - name: shift_objects
    input: input_grid, boundary, movement_direction
    output: output_grid
    process:
      - Initialize output grid based on input dimensions.
      - Copy the red boundary line from input to output.
      - Fill the rest of the output grid with white.
      - Iterate through the input grid cells (excluding the boundary).
      - For each non-white, non-red pixel found:
        - Determine its target position by moving it in the movement_direction until it hits:
          - The cell adjacent to the red boundary.
          - A cell adjacent to a non-white pixel already placed in the output grid.
        - Place the pixel's color at the calculated target position in the output grid.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Movable objects are positioned relative to the red boundary.
  - type: interaction
    description: Movable objects shift towards the red boundary until collision with the boundary or another previously shifted object.
