Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels.
2.  **Background Color:** The predominant background color is white (0).
3.  **Objects:** There are contiguous blocks of non-white colors. These appear to be the objects being manipulated.
4.  **Special Color:** The color red (2) appears consistently in each example, forming a solid line (either a full row or a full column).
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a movement or shifting of the non-white, non-red objects. The direction of movement is related to the position of the red line. Objects move towards the red line and stop when they hit it or another object that has already stopped. The space previously occupied by the moved objects becomes white.
6.  **Boundary Behavior:** The red line acts as a static boundary or wall. Objects move towards it but do not cross or displace it.
7.  **Gravity/Packing:** The objects seem to "fall" or "slide" towards the red line, packing together against it and against each other in the direction of movement.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_manipulation
components:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    properties: static, fills vacated space
  - role: boundary
    color: red (2)
    shape: solid line (row or column)
    properties: static, immovable, defines movement direction
  - role: movable_objects
    color: any color except white (0) and red (2)
    shape: contiguous blocks of single color
    properties: mobile
actions:
  - name: identify_boundary
    input: input_grid
    output: red line coordinates, orientation (horizontal/vertical), position (top/bottom/left/right)
  - name: determine_movement_direction
    input: boundary position and orientation
    output: direction vector (e.g., down, up, left, right) - always towards the boundary
  - name: shift_objects
    input: input_grid, boundary, movement_direction
    output: output_grid
    process:
      - Initialize output grid based on input dimensions.
      - Copy the red boundary line from input to output.
      - Fill the rest of the output grid with white.
      - Iterate through the input grid cells (excluding the boundary).
      - For each non-white, non-red pixel found:
        - Determine its target position by moving it in the movement_direction until it hits:
          - The cell adjacent to the red boundary.
          - A cell adjacent to a non-white pixel already placed in the output grid.
        - Place the pixel's color at the calculated target position in the output grid.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Movable objects are positioned relative to the red boundary.
  - type: interaction
    description: Movable objects shift towards the red boundary until collision with the boundary or another previously shifted object.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Boundary Line:** Find the solid line (row or column) composed entirely of red (2) pixels in the input grid. Note its orientation (horizontal or vertical) and position (e.g., row index 9, column index 0).
2.  **Determine Movement Direction:**
    *   If the boundary is a column on the left (index 0), the direction is left.
    *   If the boundary is a column on the right (max column index), the direction is right.
    *   If the boundary is a row at the top (index 0), the direction is up.
    *   If the boundary is a row at the bottom (max row index), the direction is down.
3.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
4.  **Copy Boundary:** Copy the red boundary line from the input grid to the corresponding location in the new output grid.
5.  **Initialize Background:** Fill all other cells in the new output grid with white (0).
6.  **Shift Objects Towards Boundary:** Iterate through each cell of the *input* grid. If a cell contains a color other than white (0) or red (2):
    *   Starting from the cell's original position, trace a path one step at a time in the determined movement direction.
    *   Stop tracing at the final position, which is the cell *just before* you would encounter:
        *   The red boundary line.
        *   A cell in the *output* grid that is already occupied by a non-white color (meaning another object has already settled there).
    *   Place the color from the original input cell into this final position in the *output* grid.
7.  **Return Output:** The completed new grid is the result.
