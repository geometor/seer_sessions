These appear to be the objects being manipulated.\n4.  **Special Color:** The color red (2) appears consistently in each example, forming a solid line (either a full row or a full column).\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a movement or shifting of the non-white, non-red objects. The direction of movement is related to the position of the red line. Objects move towards the red line and stop when they hit it or another object that has already stopped. The space previously occupied by the moved objects becomes white.\n6.  **Boundary Behavior:** The red line acts as a static boundary or wall. Objects move towards it but do not cross or displace it.\n7.  **Gravity/Packing:** The objects seem to \"fall\" or \"slide\" towards the red line, packing together against it and against each other in the direction of movement.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
