task_type: object_manipulation
components:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    properties: static, fills vacated space
  - role: boundary
    color: red (2)
    shape: solid line (row or column)
    properties: static, immovable, defines movement direction and acts as a collision wall
  - role: movable_objects
    color: any color except white (0) and red (2)
    shape: contiguous blocks (including single pixels) of a single color
    properties:
      - mobile
      - move as a single unit
      - maintain shape during movement
actions:
  - name: identify_boundary_and_direction
    input: input_grid
    output: boundary (orientation, index), movement_direction (dr, dc)
  - name: identify_movable_objects
    input: input_grid
    output: list of objects, where each object is defined by its color and a list of its pixel coordinates
  - name: determine_processing_order
    input: list of objects, movement_direction
    output: list of objects sorted by proximity to the boundary (objects closer to the boundary in the direction of movement are processed first)
  - name: shift_objects
    input: input_grid dimensions, boundary, movement_direction, sorted_objects
    output: output_grid
    process:
      - Initialize an empty output grid (filled with white).
      - Place the red boundary line onto the output grid.
      - Iterate through the sorted objects:
        - For the current object, determine its starting position (list of pixel coordinates).
        - Simulate moving the entire object one step at a time in the movement_direction.
        - In each step, check if *any* pixel of the object, if moved to the next position, would land on a non-white cell in the *current state* of the output grid (which includes the boundary and previously settled objects).
        - If a collision is detected for any pixel of the object, the object stops at its *current* position (before the collision step).
        - Place all pixels of the object onto the output grid at their final determined coordinates.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Movable objects are positioned relative to the red boundary and other movable objects.
  - type: interaction
    description: Movable objects shift towards the red boundary until any part of the object collides with the boundary or another previously shifted object. Objects maintain their shape. Objects effectively stack or pack against the boundary and each other.
