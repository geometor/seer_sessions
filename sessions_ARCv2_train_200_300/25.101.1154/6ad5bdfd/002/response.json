            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanism: objects shifting towards a red boundary line. However, the implementation treated each pixel independently, leading to incorrect placements when objects should interact or stack against each other orthogonally to the direction of movement. The provided code failed on all three training examples, consistently misplacing 2 pixels in each case.\n\nThe errors occur because the collision check (`output_np[next_r, next_c] != white_color`) only considers the single cell directly in the path of the moving pixel. It fails to detect collisions with already settled pixels that are adjacent to the target cell but not directly in the path (e.g., pixels below the target cell when moving left/right, or pixels beside the target cell when moving up/down).\n\nThe strategy is to revise the transformation logic to treat contiguous blocks of the same color (objects) as single units. The movement simulation must check for collisions between the *entire boundary* of the moving object and any non-white pixels (boundary or other settled objects) in the output grid.\n\n**Metrics**\n"

Determine its orientation (row/column) and index. Based on its position (top/bottom/left/right edge), determine the direction of movement (up/down/left/right as a `(dr, dc)` vector) towards the boundary.\n2.  **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct contiguous blocks of pixels that are *not* white (0) and *not* red (2). For each object, record its color and the list of (row, column) coordinates of all pixels belonging to it.\n3.  **Sort Objects:** Create an order for processing the objects. Sort them based on their proximity to the boundary in the direction of movement. For example:\n    *   If moving down (`dr=1`), sort objects by their maximum row index in descending order (bottom-most objects first).\n    *   If moving up (`dr=-1`), sort objects by their minimum row index in ascending order (top-most objects first).\n    *   If moving right (`dc=1`), sort objects by their maximum column index in descending order (right-most objects first).\n    *   If moving left (`dc=-1`), sort objects by their minimum column index in ascending order (left-most objects first).\n4.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input, initially filled entirely with white (0).\n5.  **Place Boundary:** Copy the red boundary line from the input grid to the new output grid.\n6.  **Shift Objects:** Iterate through the *sorted* objects:\n    *   Let the object's current coordinates be its original coordinates from the input.\n    *   Start a loop to simulate movement steps:\n        *   Calculate the *potential next coordinates* for *all* pixels of the object by adding the movement direction vector (`dr`, `dc`) to their current coordinates.\n        *   Check for collisions: For *each* potential next coordinate, check if it falls outside the grid boundaries OR if the corresponding cell in the *output grid* is currently non-white (0).\n        *   If *any* potential next coordinate results in a collision (out of bounds or hits a non-white cell), then the object cannot move further. Break the movement loop. The object's final position is its *current* position.\n        *   If *no* collision is detected for *any* pixel, update the object's current coordinates to the potential next coordinates and continue the movement loop.\n    *   Once the movement loop stops (either by collision or hitting the grid edge implicitly handled by boundary placement), place the object onto the *output grid* by setting the color of its pixels at their final determined coordinates.\n7.  **Return Output:** The completed output grid is the result."
