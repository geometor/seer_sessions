GridProperties:
  - size: [9, 9]
  - background_color: Determined as the most frequent color in the input grid (magenta/6).

Objects:
  - type: SolidBlock
    properties:
      - shape: 3x3 square
      - composition: Monochromatic (single non-background color)
      - location: Various (e.g., top-left, bottom-right)
    actions:
      - identify
      - preserve_in_output
  - type: NoisePixel
    properties:
      - shape: 1x1 pixel
      - color: Non-background color, matches a SolidBlock color
      - location: Scattered, not part of a SolidBlock
    actions:
      - identify
      - remove_from_output (replace with background_color)
  - type: BackgroundPixel
    properties:
      - color: background_color
    actions:
      - identify
      - potentially_change_color

Relationships_And_Actions:
  - relationship: Adjacency (Orthogonal)
    applies_to: [BackgroundPixel, SolidBlock]
  - relationship: Adjacency (OrthogonalOrDiagonal)
    applies_to: [BackgroundPixel, NoisePixel]
  - action: ConditionalColorChange
    trigger: A BackgroundPixel `n` changes to color `c` if:
      1. `input[n]` is background_color.
      2. `n` is orthogonally adjacent to a SolidBlock `b` of color `c`.
      3. `n` is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to a NoisePixel `p` of color `c`.
    target: BackgroundPixel `n`
    result: `output[n]` becomes color `c`.
  - action: Initialization
    target: OutputGrid
    result: Filled with background_color.
  - action: Finalization
    trigger: After processing all conditional changes.
    result: OutputGrid contains preserved SolidBlocks and changed BackgroundPixels. All other pixels (original NoisePixels and unchanged BackgroundPixels) have the background_color.
