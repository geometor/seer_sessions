## Perception

The task involves processing a 9x9 grid containing a background color and several other colors. Some non-background colors form solid 3x3 blocks, while others appear as scattered individual pixels ("noise"). The transformation aims to clean up the noise and slightly expand the solid blocks based on the location of the noise.

Key observations:
1.  **Background:** There is a dominant background color (magenta/6 in both examples).
2.  **Solid Blocks:** There are distinct 3x3 areas completely filled with a single non-background color (Maroon/9 and Yellow/4 in train_1; Red/2 and Gray/5 in train_2). These blocks are preserved in the output.
3.  **Noise Pixels:** There are scattered pixels of the same colors as the blocks, but not part of the blocks. These noise pixels are removed in the output (replaced by the background color).
4.  **Block Expansion:** Some background pixels immediately adjacent (orthogonally) to the solid blocks change color to match the block. This change only occurs if the background pixel is also adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to a noise pixel of the same color as the block.

    actions:
      - identify
      - preserve_in_output
  - type: NoisePixel
    properties:
      - shape: 1x1 pixel
      - color: Non-background color, matches a SolidBlock color

Relationships_And_Actions:
  - relationship: Adjacency (Orthogonal)
    applies_to: [BackgroundPixel, SolidBlock]
  - relationship: Adjacency (OrthogonalOrDiagonal)
    applies_to: [BackgroundPixel, NoisePixel]
  - action: ConditionalColorChange
    trigger: A BackgroundPixel `n` changes to color `c` if:
      1. `input[n]` is background_color.
      2. `n` is orthogonally adjacent to a SolidBlock `b` of color `c`.
      3. `n` is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to a NoisePixel `p` of color `c`.
    target: BackgroundPixel `n`
    result: `output[n]` becomes color `c`.
  - action: Initialization
    target: OutputGrid
    result: Filled with background_color.
  - action: Finalization
    trigger: After processing all conditional changes.
    result: OutputGrid contains preserved SolidBlocks and changed BackgroundPixels. All other pixels (original NoisePixels and unchanged BackgroundPixels) have the background_color.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Background:** Find the color that appears most frequently in the input grid and designate it as the background color.
2.  **Identify Objects:**
    a.  Scan the input grid to locate all solid 3x3 blocks composed of a single non-background color. Record their color and coordinates.
    b.  Identify all other non-background pixels in the input grid that are not part of these 3x3 blocks. These are the "noise pixels". Record their color and coordinates.
3.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background color.
4.  **Preserve Blocks:** Copy the identified 3x3 solid blocks from the input grid onto the output grid at their corresponding locations.
5.  **Determine Expansion:** Create a list to store coordinates of background cells that should change color. Iterate through each identified solid 3x3 block `b` with color `c`:
    a.  For each cell `n` that is orthogonally adjacent to block `b`:
        i.  Check if the cell `n` contained the background color in the *original input grid*.
        ii. Check if the cell `n` is adjacent (using 8-way adjacency, including diagonals) to any *noise pixel* `p` that has the same color `c` as the block `b`.
        iii. If both conditions (i and ii) are true, add the coordinates of cell `n` and the color `c` to the list of changes.
6.  **Apply Expansion:** Iterate through the list of changes. For each coordinate and color pair `(n, c)` in the list, set the color of cell `n` in the output grid to `c`.
7.  **Finalize:** The resulting output grid, containing the preserved blocks and the expanded areas (changed background cells), is the final output. Noise pixels are implicitly removed because they were not copied from the input, and the output grid was initialized with the background color.
