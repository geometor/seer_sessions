## General Assessment

The previous execution attempt using Hypothesis 8 (Strict Bound + Row/Column Alignment) produced outputs that matched the expected outputs for both training examples according to the final summary report (`Match: True` for Example 1, `Match: True` for Example 2 - although the intermediate comparison showed Pixels Off > 0 which was confusing). However, a closer look at the reported transformed output for Example 2 reveals it did *not* perfectly match the expected output. There seems to be a contradiction between the final match status and the displayed grid/pixel difference in the previous run's report.

To resolve this discrepancy and ensure accuracy, we will re-run the analysis focusing specifically on Hypothesis 8. We need clear metrics on exactly which pixels are predicted to change by H8 and compare that directly against the pixels that *actually* change in the expected outputs.

**Strategy:**
1.  Re-execute the metrics analysis code specifically designed to test Hypothesis 8 (Strict Bound + Row/Column Alignment).
2.  Carefully compare the `h8_predictions` generated by the code with the `expected_changes` derived from the input/output pairs for both examples.
3.  Identify any discrepancies (false positives or false negatives) predicted by H8.
4.  Based on these precise results, confirm if H8 is the correct rule or if further refinement is needed. If refinement is needed, analyze the specific failing cases to develop a new hypothesis (Hypothesis 9).
5.  Update the YAML Facts and Natural Language Program based on the confirmed transformation rule.

The detailed metrics confirm the previous assessment: Hypothesis 8 (Strict Bound + Row/Column Alignment) works perfectly for `train_1` but fails for `train_2`.

*   **Train 1:** All expected changes are predicted by H8, and there are no false positives.
*   **Train 2:** H8 correctly predicts changes for `(0,3)`, `(1,3)`, `(3,1)`, `(3,2)`, `(5,7)`, `(7,5)`. It correctly avoids the false positives seen with H7. However, it fails to predict the required changes for `(2,3)` (should be Red 2), `(6,5)` (should be Gray 5), and `(8,5)` (should be Gray 5). These are false negatives.

**Conclusion:** Hypothesis 8 is incorrect. The strict row/column alignment rule is too restrictive.

**Developing Hypothesis 9:**
We need a rule that behaves like H8 for `train_1` (avoiding H7's false positives) but allows the changes at `(2,3)`, `(6,5)`, and `(8,5)` in `train_2`.

Let's look at the specific false negatives from H8 in `train_2`:
*   **`(2,3)`:** Adjacent to "Right" side of Red block (0,0)-(2,2). Noise activating "Right" is `(0,8), (1,8), (3,4)`. None are on row 2.
*   **`(6,5)`:** Adjacent to "Left" side of Gray block (6,6)-(8,8). Noise activating "Left" is `(5,4), (7,0)`. None are on row 6.
*   **`(8,5)`:** Adjacent to "Left" side of Gray block (6,6)-(8,8). Noise activating "Left" is `(5,4), (7,0)`. None are on row 8.

Compare these to the false positives *avoided* by H8 (i.e., correctly predicted as *no change*):
*   **T1 `(1,3)`:** Adjacent to "Right" of Red block. Noise activating "Right" is `(0,8), (1,8), (3,4)`. None on row 1. Correctly no change.
*   **T1 `(6,5)`:** Adjacent to "Left" of Yellow block. Noise activating "Left" is `(7,2), (8,3)`. None on row 6. Correctly no change.
*   **T2 `(3,0)`:** Adjacent to "Below" Red block. Noise activating "Below" is `(3,4), (4,1), (8,2)`. None on col 0. Correctly no change.
*   **T2 `(5,6)`:** Adjacent to "Above" Gray block. Noise activating "Above" is `(4,7), (5,4)`. None on col 6. Correctly no change.
*   **T2 `(5,8)`:** Adjacent to "Above" Gray block. Noise activating "Above" is `(4,7), (5,4)`. None on col 8. Correctly no change.

What is different between the false negatives `(2,3), (6,5), (8,5)` and the true negatives `(1,3), (6,5)_T1, (3,0), (5,6), (5,8)`?

Consider the *corners* of the block.
*   `(2,3)` is adjacent to the *side* `(2,2)` which is a corner of the Red block.
*   `(6,5)` is adjacent to the *side* `(6,6)` which is a corner of the Gray block.
*   `(8,5)` is adjacent to the *side* `(8,6)` which is a corner of the Gray block.

Now look at the true negatives (H8 correctly predicts no change):
*   `T1 (1,3)` is adjacent to `(1,2)` (middle of Red block edge).
*   `T1 (6,5)` is adjacent to `(6,6)` (corner of Yellow block). Wait, this conflicts. Let's re-check T1/Yellow/Left. Noise: (7,2), (8,3). Active Left. Candidates: (6,5), (7,5), (8,5). H8 predicts change for (7,5) [aligned with (7,2)] and (8,5) [aligned with (8,3)]. H8 correctly predicts NO change for (6,5). Pixel (6,5) is adjacent to corner (6,6).
*   `T2 (3,0)` is adjacent to `(2,0)` (corner of Red block).
*   `T2 (5,6)` is adjacent to `(6,6)` (corner of Gray block).
*   `T2 (5,8)` is adjacent to `(6,8)` (corner of Gray block).

Okay, adjacency to a corner doesn't seem to be the deciding factor alone.

Let's rethink the trigger. Maybe it's not *aligned* noise, but *any* noise in the active direction? (That was H7, which over-predicted).

What if the expansion "propagates" from the corners?
Or, what if we need noise alignment *or* some other condition?

Consider the distance? No, that seems unlikely for ARC.

Let's reconsider the concept of "activating" a side. H7/H8 defined "active" based on *any* noise beyond the boundary.
*   T2, Red block, Right side: Noise `(0,8), (1,8), (3,4)` exist.
*   T2, Gray block, Left side: Noise `(5,4), (7,0)` exist.

What if the rule is: A candidate pixel `n` adjacent to side `S` changes IF *EITHER*:
1.  (H8 condition) There exists noise `p` beyond side `S` aligned with `n`.
2.  OR `n` is adjacent to a *corner* of the block, AND there exists noise `p` beyond the *two* sides forming that corner?

Let's test this hypothetical H9:
*   **T2 `(2,3)`** - False Negative for H8:
    *   Adjacent to "Right" side. H8 fails (no aligned noise).
    *   Is `(2,3)` adjacent to a corner? Yes, `(2,2)` (bottom-right corner of Red block).
    *   Sides forming corner `(2,2)` are "Right" and "Below".
    *   Is there noise beyond "Right"? Yes (`(0,8), (1,8), (3,4)`).
    *   Is there noise beyond "Below"? Yes (`(3,4), (4,1), (8,2)`).
    *   Condition 2 met? Yes. -> H9 predicts change. (Correct)
*   **T2 `(6,5)`** - False Negative for H8:
    *   Adjacent to "Left" side. H8 fails.
    *   Adjacent to corner? Yes, `(6,6)` (top-left corner of Gray block).
    *   Sides forming corner `(6,6)` are "Left" and "Above".
    *   Noise beyond "Left"? Yes (`(5,4), (7,0)`).
    *   Noise beyond "Above"? Yes (`(4,7), (5,4)`).
    *   Condition 2 met? Yes. -> H9 predicts change. (Correct)
*   **T2 `(8,5)`** - False Negative for H8:
    *   Adjacent to "Left" side. H8 fails.
    *   Adjacent to corner? Yes, `(8,6)` (bottom-left corner of Gray block).
    *   Sides forming corner `(8,6)` are "Left" and "Below".
    *   Noise beyond "Left"? Yes (`(5,4), (7,0)`).
    *   Noise beyond "Below"? No noise below row 8.
    *   Condition 2 met? No. -> H9 still predicts no change. (Incorrect - fails for (8,5))

Hypothesis 9 fails for `(8,5)`. Backtrack.

What if the rule is simply: If a side `S` is "active" (has noise beyond its boundary), *all* background pixels adjacent to that side change color? This is essentially Hypothesis 7, which we know over-predicts.

Let's focus on the difference between H7 (over-predicts) and the expected output.
*   **T1 `(1,3)`:** H7 predicts change (Right active). Expected: no change.
*   **T1 `(6,5)`:** H7 predicts change (Left active). Expected: no change.
*   **T2 `(3,0)`:** H7 predicts change (Below active). Expected: no change.
*   **T2 `(5,6)`:** H7 predicts change (Above active). Expected: no change.
*   **T2 `(5,8)`:** H7 predicts change (Above active). Expected: no change.

What characteristic do `(1,3), (6,5)_T1, (3,0), (5,6), (5,8)` share that prevents the change?
And what characteristic do `(2,3), (6,5)_T2, (8,5)` share that *allows* the change even without strict H8 alignment?

Consider the *number* of noise pixels activating a side? Doesn't seem consistent.
Consider the *position* of the adjacent block pixel? Middle vs Corner?
*   Pixels that *shouldn't* change (H7 False Positives):
    *   `T1 (1,3)` adj. to `(1,2)` (Middle)
    *   `T1 (6,5)` adj. to `(6,6)` (Corner)
    *   `T2 (3,0)` adj. to `(2,0)` (Corner)
    *   `T2 (5,6)` adj. to `(6,6)` (Corner)
    *   `T2 (5,8)` adj. to `(6,8)` (Corner)
*   Pixels that *should* change but fail H8 (H8 False Negatives):
    *   `T2 (2,3)` adj. to `(2,2)` (Corner)
    *   `T2 (6,5)` adj. to `(6,6)` (Corner)
    *   `T2 (8,5)` adj. to `(8,6)` (Corner)

This is confusing. Adjacency to a corner doesn't seem deterministic.

Let's reconsider H8 - Alignment. Could the definition of alignment be wrong?
H8: `c_p == c_n` for Above/Below sides; `r_p == r_n` for Left/Right sides.
What if alignment is defined differently?

What if the rule is simpler: A pixel `n` adjacent to block `b` changes color if *any* noise pixel `p` of the same color exists such that `p` is "in the direction" of `n` relative to the block *center*? This was Hypothesis 2/3/6/7 territory which over-predicted.

Let's look at the specific noise pixels again relative to the H8 false negatives:
*   `T2 (2,3)` [Right of Red block]: Needs change. Activating noise: `(0,8), (1,8), (3,4)`. None have `r_p=2`.
*   `T2 (6,5)` [Left of Gray block]: Needs change. Activating noise: `(5,4), (7,0)`. None have `r_p=6`.
*   `T2 (8,5)` [Left of Gray block]: Needs change. Activating noise: `(5,4), (7,0)`. None have `r_p=8`.

Is it possible the 3x3 block identification is wrong? No, seems robust.
Is it possible the noise identification is wrong? No, seems robust.

Is there a simpler pattern?
Look at the output grids. The expanded blocks look like the original 3x3 block with some adjacent pixels filled in.
The filled-in pixels always form orthogonal extensions.
*   T1 Red Block: Extends Right by 1 col (rows 0, 2) and Below by 1 row (cols 0, 1, 2).
*   T1 Yellow Block: Extends Above by 1 row (cols 6, 7, 8) and Left by 1 col (rows 7, 8).
*   T2 Red Block: Extends Right by 1 col (rows 0, 1, 2) and Below by 1 row (cols 1, 2).
*   T2 Gray Block: Extends Above by 1 row (col 7) and Left by 1 col (rows 6, 7, 8).

Focus on the pixels *not* filled in T2 where H7 predicted a change: `(3,0)`, `(5,6)`, `(5,8)`.
Focus on the pixels filled in T2 where H8 predicted *no* change: `(2,3)`, `(6,5)`, `(8,5)`.

Maybe the rule involves checking alignment *along the whole edge*?
Let's define "Side Noise Alignment": For a side `S` (e.g., "Right", rows 0-2), does there exist noise `p` beyond side `S` such that `p` aligns with *any* pixel coordinate along that side?
*   T2, Red Block (0,0)-(2,2)
    *   Right Side (rows 0, 1, 2 at col 2): Noise beyond right: `(0,8), (1,8), (3,4)`.
        *   Does noise exist with `r_p = 0`? Yes, `(0,8)`.
        *   Does noise exist with `r_p = 1`? Yes, `(1,8)`.
        *   Does noise exist with `r_p = 2`? No.
    *   Below Side (cols 0, 1, 2 at row 2): Noise below: `(3,4), (4,1), (8,2)`.
        *   Does noise exist with `c_p = 0`? No.
        *   Does noise exist with `c_p = 1`? Yes, `(4,1)`.
        *   Does noise exist with `c_p = 2`? Yes, `(8,2)`.
*   T2, Gray Block (6,6)-(8,8)
    *   Above Side (cols 6, 7, 8 at row 6): Noise above: `(4,7), (5,4)`.
        *   Does noise exist with `c_p = 6`? No.
        *   Does noise exist with `c_p = 7`? Yes, `(4,7)`.
        *   Does noise exist with `c_p = 8`? No.
    *   Left Side (rows 6, 7, 8 at col 6): Noise left: `(5,4), (7,0)`.
        *   Does noise exist with `r_p = 6`? No.
        *   Does noise exist with `r_p = 7`? Yes, `(7,0)`.
        *   Does noise exist with `r_p = 8`? No.

**Hypothesis 9 (Revised): Side Activation by Aligned Noise**
A background pixel `n` at `(r_n, c_n)` adjacent to side `S` of block `b` changes color IF:
1.  There exists *any* noise pixel `p` beyond side `S`. (This activates the side generally, like H7).
2.  AND there exists *at least one* noise pixel `p_align` beyond side `S` that aligns (row/column match) with *any* coordinate `(r_edge, c_edge)` belonging to the edge segment defined by side `S`.

Let's test H9:
*   **T2 Red Block:**
    *   Right Side: Active (Noise exists beyond)? Yes. Aligned noise exists for rows 0 and 1? Yes (`(0,8)`, `(1,8)`). Rule: Change *all* pixels adjacent to Right side (rows 0, 1, 2)? Changes: `(0,3), (1,3), (2,3)`. (Matches expected!)
    *   Below Side: Active? Yes. Aligned noise exists for cols 1 and 2? Yes (`(4,1)`, `(8,2)`). Rule: Change *all* pixels adjacent to Below side (cols 0, 1, 2)? Changes: `(3,0), (3,1), (3,2)`. (Over-predicts (3,0)!)

Hypothesis 9 also fails. It fixes the false negatives but reintroduces false positives.

Let's combine H8 and H9(R)? What if a pixel `n` changes if EITHER H8 is true for `n`, OR `n` is adjacent to a corner activated on both sides (original H9)?

Hypothesis 10: Union of H8 and H9(original corner rule)
Pixel `n` changes if:
1. (H8): Noise `p` exists beyond adj. side `S` AND `p` aligns with `n`.
   OR
2. (H9corner): `n` is adjacent to corner `C` formed by sides `S1, S2`, AND noise exists beyond `S1`, AND noise exists beyond `S2`.

Test H10 on T2:
*   Pixels predicted by H8: `(0,3), (1,3), (3,1), (3,2), (5,7), (7,5)`.
*   Check H9corner for H8 False Negatives:
    *   `T2 (2,3)`: Adj corner (2,2). Sides R, B. Noise beyond R? Y. Noise beyond B? Y. -> H9corner predicts change.
    *   `T2 (6,5)`: Adj corner (6,6). Sides L, A. Noise beyond L? Y. Noise beyond A? Y. -> H9corner predicts change.
    *   `T2 (8,5)`: Adj corner (8,6). Sides L, B. Noise beyond L? Y. Noise beyond B? N. -> H9corner predicts NO change.

H10 predicts: `(0,3), (1,3), (3,1), (3,2), (5,7), (7,5)` [from H8] + `(2,3), (6,5)` [from H9corner].
Total H10 Predictions: `(0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (5,7), (6,5), (7,5)`.
Expected Changes: `(0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (5,7), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5)`.
H10 still misses `(8,5)`.

What is special about `(8,5)`? It's adjacent to corner `(8,6)`. Sides L, B. Noise exists beyond L, but not B. H8 alignment fails. H9corner fails. Why does it change?

Is the alignment rule (H8) subtly different?
Maybe alignment only requires the noise to be in *any* of the rows/columns spanned by the side?
H8 check for T2 `(8,5)`: Adj side L (rows 6, 7, 8 at col 6). Noise Left: `(5,4), (7,0)`. Does `r_p == r_n (8)`? No.
What if it's `c_p < c_min (6)` AND `r_p` is in `[r_min(6), r_max(8)]`?
Noise `(5,4)`: `c_p=4<6`, but `r_p=5` is not in `[6, 8]`.
Noise `(7,0)`: `c_p=0<6`, and `r_p=7` is in `[6, 8]`.
This modified alignment rule would trigger for `(8,5)`. Let's call it H8-modified.

Test H8-modified: Pixel `n=(r_n, c_n)` changes if adjacent to side `S` and noise `p=(r_p, c_p)` exists such that:
*   Side Above: `r_p < r_min` AND `c_p` in `[c_min, c_max]`
*   Side Below: `r_p > r_max` AND `c_p` in `[c_min, c_max]`
*   Side Left: `c_p < c_min` AND `r_p` in `[r_min, r_max]`
*   Side Right: `c_p > c_max` AND `r_p` in `[r_min, r_max]`

Test H8-modified on T2:
*   `(2,3)`: Adj R. Side R = rows [0,2]. Noise R: `(0,8), (1,8), (3,4)`. Check `c_p > 2` AND `r_p` in `[0, 2]`. Noise `(0,8)`: Y, Y. Noise `(1,8)`: Y, Y. -> Triggers. Predicts change (Correct).
*   `(6,5)`: Adj L. Side L = rows [6,8]. Noise L: `(5,4), (7,0)`. Check `c_p < 6` AND `r_p` in `[6, 8]`. Noise `(5,4)`: Y, N. Noise `(7,0)`: Y, Y. -> Triggers. Predicts change (Correct).
*   `(8,5)`: Adj L. Side L = rows [6,8]. Noise L: `(5,4), (7,0)`. Check `c_p < 6` AND `r_p` in `[6, 8]`. Noise `(5,4)`: Y, N. Noise `(7,0)`: Y, Y. -> Triggers. Predicts change (Correct).

Now check H8-modified on the True Negatives (where H7 failed):
*   T1
 `(1,3)`: Adj R. Side R = rows [0,2]. Noise R: `(0,7),(2,5)`. Check `c_p > 2` AND `r_p` in `[0, 2]`. Noise `(0,7)`: Y, Y. Noise `(2,5)`: Y, Y. -> Triggers. Predicts change (INCORRECT - H8m fails here).
*   T1 `(6,5)`: Adj L. Side L = rows [6,8]. Noise L: `(7,2),(8,3)`. Check `c_p < 6` AND `r_p` in `[6, 8]`. Noise `(7,2)`: Y, Y. Noise `(8,3)`: Y, Y. -> Triggers. Predicts change (INCORRECT - H8m fails here).

H8-modified is also wrong. It seems the original strict alignment (H8) is mostly correct, but something else allows `(2,3)`, `(6,5)`, `(8,5)` in T2 to change.

Final attempt: Combine H7 (General Activation) and H8 (Strict Alignment).
Hypothesis 11: A pixel `n` adjacent to side `S` changes IF side `S` is generally active (noise exists beyond boundary) AND the H8 strict alignment condition holds for pixel `n`.

This is just H8 again, because H8 implies the side is active.

What if the block expands to "reach" the nearest aligned noise? No, that seems too complex.

Let's assume H8 is the correct rule and there's something subtle about the examples, like maybe my expected output for T2 is wrong?

My analysis of H8 predictions vs expected seems correct. H8 fails on `(2,3), (6,5), (8,5)`.

Maybe the definition of noise is wrong? Pixels not part of a 3x3 block. Seems ok.
Maybe the definition of the 3x3 block is wrong? Must be solid. Seems ok.

Let's revisit the failing H8 cases visually.
*   `T2 (2,3)`: Needs to be Red. Red block (0,0-2,2). Noise Red: `(0,8), (1,8), (3,4), (4,1), (8,2)`. The change happens at the bottom-right of the block's expansion zone. Noise exists to the right `(0,8), (1,8)` and below `(3,4), (4,1), (8,2)`.
*   `T2 (6,5)`: Needs to be Gray. Gray block (6,6-8,8). Noise Gray: `(4,7), (5,4), (7,0)`. Change happens at top-left of expansion. Noise exists above `(4,7), (5,4)` and left `(5,4), (7,0)`.
*   `T2 (8,5)`: Needs to be Gray. Gray block (6,6-8,8). Noise Gray: `(4,7), (5,4), (7,0)`. Change happens at bottom-left of expansion. Noise exists above `(4,7), (5,4)` and left `(5,4), (7,0)`.

Is it related to corners where *both* adjacent sides are active?
*   `T2 (2,3)`: Adj corner `(2,2)`. Sides R, B. Noise beyond R? Y. Noise beyond B? Y. => Change? Yes.
*   `T2 (6,5)`: Adj corner `(6,6)`. Sides L, A. Noise beyond L? Y. Noise beyond A? Y. => Change? Yes.
*   `T2 (8,5)`: Adj corner `(8,6)`. Sides L, B. Noise beyond L? Y. Noise beyond B? N. => Change? Yes.

This "Both Sides Active Corner" rule (H9 original) explained (2,3) and (6,5) but not (8,5).

What if the rule is: Change pixel `n` if H8 is true OR if `n` is adjacent to a corner `C` where at least *one* of the two sides forming `C` has aligned noise (H8)?
Test H12 = H8 OR (AdjCorner AND (Side1 has H8 alignment OR Side2 has H8 alignment))
*   T2 (8,5): Adj Corner (8,6). Sides L, B. Does Side L have H8 alignment? Check noise Left `(5,4), (7,0)`. Does `r_p` align with `(6,6), (7,6), (8,6)`? Yes, `(7,0)` aligns with `(7,6)`. Does Side B have H8 alignment? Check noise Below (none). No. Since Side L has H8 alignment, condition 2 is met. -> H12 predicts change. (Correct!)

Let's recheck the other H8 false negatives with H12:
*   T2 (2,3): Adj Corner (2,2). Sides R, B. Does Side R have H8 alignment? Check noise Right `(0,8),(1,8),(3,4)`. Does `r_p` align with `(0,2),(1,2),(2,2)`? Yes, `(0,8)` aligns with `(0,2)`; `(1,8)` aligns with `(1,2)`. Yes. Condition 2 met. -> H12 predicts change. (Correct!)
*   T2 (6,5): Adj Corner (6,6). Sides L, A. Does Side L have H8 alignment? Yes, `(7,0)` aligns with `(7,6)`. Does Side A have H8 alignment? Yes, `(4,7)` aligns with `(6,7)`. Yes. Condition 2 met. -> H12 predicts change. (Correct!)

Now check H12 on the H7 False Positives (where H8 correctly predicted no change):
*   T1 `(1,3)`: Adj side R. H8 fails. Adj corner? No. -> H12 predicts no change (Correct).
*   T1 `(6,5)`: Adj side L. H8 fails. Adj corner `(6,6)`. Sides L, A. Does Side L have H8 alignment (for rows 6,7,8)? Noise L `(7,2),(8,3)`. Yes, `(7,2)` aligns with `(7,6)`, `(8,3)` aligns with `(8,6)`. Does Side A have H8 alignment (for cols 6,7,8)? Noise A `(0,8),(1,6),(1,7)`. Yes, `(1,6)` aligns with `(6,6)`, `(1,7)` aligns with `(6,7)`, `(0,8)` aligns with `(6,8)`. Yes. Condition 2 met. -> H12 predicts change (INCORRECT).

Hypothesis 12 fails. The interaction is more complex.

Let's go back to the simplest rule that worked for T1: H8. Strict Alignment.
Rule: Pixel `n` changes if adjacent to side `S` and noise `p` exists beyond `S` AND `p` aligns with `n`.
This fails for T2 `(2,3), (6,5), (8,5)`.

Consider the *shape* of the expansion. It seems to fill a rectangle defined by the block and the outermost aligned noise pixels.
*   T2 Red block (0,0)-(2,2). Noise R: `(0,8), (1,8), (3,4)`. Noise B: `(3,4), (4,1), (8,2)`.
    *   Max row of Right noise = 3. Max col = 8.
    *   Max row of Below noise = 8. Max col = 4.
    *   H8 aligned noise R: `(0,8)` (aligns with `(0,3)`), `(1,8)` (aligns with `(1,3)`). Max row = 1.
    *   H8 aligned noise B: `(4,1)` (aligns with `(3,1)`), `(8,2)` (aligns with `(3,2)`). Max col = 2.
    *   Expansion Right occurs up to row 1. Expansion Below occurs up to col 2.
    *   This implies changes at `(0,3), (1,3), (3,1), (3,2)`. Still misses `(2,3)`.

*   T2 Gray block (6,6)-(8,8). Noise A: `(4,7), (5,4)`. Noise L: `(5,4), (7,0)`.
    *   Min row of Above noise = 4. Max col = 7.
    *   Min col of Left noise = 0. Max row = 7.
    *   H8 aligned noise A: `(4,7)` (aligns with `(5,7)`). Min row = 4.
    *   H8 aligned noise L: `(7,0)` (aligns with `(7,5)`). Min col = 0.
    *   Expansion Above occurs down to row 4? No, only at col 7. Expansion Left occurs up to col 0? No, only at row 7.
    *   This implies changes at `(5,7), (7,5)`. Still misses `(6,5), (8,5)`.

Maybe the expansion fills the bounding box defined by the block AND *all* noise pixels?
*   T2 Red block (0,0)-(2,2). All Red Noise `(0,8), (1,8), (3,4), (4,1), (8,2)`.
    *   Overall bounds: min r=0, max r=8, min c=0, max c=8. -> Fills everything? No.
*   T2 Gray block (6,6)-(8,8). All Gray Noise `(4,7), (5,4), (7,0)`.
    *   Overall bounds: min r=4, max r=8, min c=0, max c=8. -> Fills everything? No.

Revisit H8. It perfectly explains Train 1. It fails only on 3 pixels in Train 2. Let's assume H8 is the *primary* rule, and there's a secondary, minor rule or exception for those 3 pixels.
The 3 pixels are `(2,3)`, `(6,5)`, `(8,5)`. All are adjacent to corners of their respective blocks.
Maybe the rule is: H8 OR (AdjacentToCorner AND Side1IsActive AND Side2IsActive)? (This was H9 original, failed on (8,5)).

Let's stick with H8 as the most robust hypothesis identified so far, acknowledging it fails on 3 specific pixels in one example. The task might have noise or ambiguity, or H8 captures the main intent. The coder phase can implement H8, and if it fails validation, we revisit.

## Natural Language Program

*(Based on Hypothesis 8)*

1.  **Identify Background:** Find the color that appears most frequently in the input grid. This is the `background_color`.
2.  **Identify Objects:**
    a.  Scan the input grid to locate all solid 3x3 blocks composed of a single non-background color. For each block, record its color `c`, its set of coordinates, and its bounding box (`r_min`, `r_max`, `c_min`, `c_max`).
    b.  Identify all other non-background pixels in the input grid that are not part of these 3x3 blocks. These are the "noise pixels". Group these noise pixels by color, storing their coordinates `P_c` for each color `c`.
3.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the `background_color`.
4.  **Preserve Blocks:** Copy the identified 3x3 solid blocks from the input grid onto the output grid at their corresponding locations.
5.  **Determine Expansion (Hypothesis 8 Rule):** Create a list or dictionary to store coordinates of background cells that should change color. Iterate through each identified solid 3x3 block `b` with color `c`, bounds (`r_min`, `r_max`, `c_min`, `c_max`), and noise coordinates `P_c`:
    a.  If `P_c` is empty, skip to the next block.
    b.  Find all candidate background pixels `n = (r_n, c_n)` in the *original input grid* that are orthogonally adjacent to any *edge* pixel of block `b`.
    c.  For each candidate pixel `n`:
        i.  Determine the side(s) `S` relative to the block `b` that `n` is adjacent to (e.g., "Above", "Left").
        ii. Assume `n` does not change initially.
        iii. Check if the expansion condition is met: Iterate through each side `s` in `S`. Does there exist *at least one* noise pixel `p = (r_p, c_p)` in `P_c` such that:
            *   `p` is strictly outside the block boundary corresponding to side `s` (e.g., if `s` is "Above", `r_p < r_min`)
            *   AND `p` is strictly aligned with `n` relative to side `s` (i.e., if `s` is "Above" or "Below", `c_p == c_n`; if `s` is "Left" or "Right", `r_p == r_n`).
        iv. If the condition in step (iii) is met for *any* side `s` in `S`, mark candidate pixel `n` to be changed to color `c` and break the side-checking loop for this candidate `n`.
6.  **Apply Expansion:** Iterate through the marked candidate pixels. For each marked coordinate `n`, set the color of cell `n` in the output grid to its corresponding marked color `c`.
7.  **Finalize:** The resulting output grid, containing the preserved blocks and the expanded areas (changed background cells based on H8), is the final output. Noise pixels are implicitly removed.


*(Self-correction note: Acknowledge that this program based on H8 is expected to fail on train_2 pixels (2,3), (6,5), and (8,5) based on the metrics analysis.)*
