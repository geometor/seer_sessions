            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous execution attempt using Hypothesis 8 (Strict Bound + Row/Column Alignment) produced outputs that matched the expected outputs for both training examples according to the final summary report (`Match: True` for Example 1, `Match: True` for Example 2 - although the intermediate comparison showed Pixels Off > 0 which was confusing). However, a closer look at the reported transformed output for Example 2 reveals it did *not* perfectly match the expected output. There seems to be a contradiction between the final match status and the displayed grid/pixel difference in the previous run's report.\n\nTo resolve this discrepancy and ensure accuracy, we will re-run the analysis focusing specifically on Hypothesis 8. We need clear metrics on exactly which pixels are predicted to change by H8 and compare that directly against the pixels that *actually* change in the expected outputs.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Re-execute the metrics analysis code specifically designed to test Hypothesis 8 (Strict Bound + Row/Column Alignment).\n2.  Carefully compare the `h8_predictions` generated by the code with the `expected_changes` derived from the input/output pairs for both examples.\n3.  Identify any discrepancies (false positives or false negatives) predicted by H8.\n4.  Based on these precise results, confirm if H8 is the correct rule or if further refinement is needed. If refinement is needed, analyze the specific failing cases to develop a new hypothesis (Hypothesis 9).\n5.  Update the YAML Facts and Natural Language Program based on the confirmed transformation rule.\n\n## Metrics\n\nExecuting the code to re-evaluate Hypothesis 8 (Strict Bound + Row/Column Alignment):\n\n*code_execution:*\n"

            "text": "\n\nThe detailed metrics confirm the previous assessment: Hypothesis 8 (Strict Bound + Row/Column Alignment) works perfectly for `train_1` but fails for `train_2`.\n\n*   **Train 1:** All expected changes are predicted by H8, and there are no false positives.\n*   **Train 2:** H8 correctly predicts changes for `(0,3)`, `(1,3)`, `(3,1)`, `(3,2)`, `(5,7)`, `(7,5)`. It correctly avoids the false positives seen with H7. However, it fails to predict the required changes for `(2,3)` (should be Red 2), `(6,5)` (should be Gray 5), and `(8,5)` (should be Gray 5). These are false negatives.\n\n**Conclusion:** Hypothesis 8 is incorrect. The strict row/column alignment rule is too restrictive.\n\n**Developing Hypothesis 9:**\nWe need a rule that behaves like H8 for `train_1` (avoiding H7's false positives) but allows the changes at `(2,3)`, `(6,5)`, and `(8,5)` in `train_2`.\n\nLet's look at the specific false negatives from H8 in `train_2`:\n*   **`(2,3)`:** Adjacent to \"Right\" side of Red block (0,0)-(2,2). Noise activating \"Right\" is `(0,8), (1,8), (3,4)`. None are on row 2.\n*   **`(6,5)`:** Adjacent to \"Left\" side of Gray block (6,6)-(8,8). Noise activating \"Left\" is `(5,4), (7,0)`. None are on row 6.\n*   **`(8,5)`:** Adjacent to \"Left\" side of Gray block (6,6)-(8,8). Noise activating \"Left\" is `(5,4), (7,0)`. None are on row 8.\n\nCompare these to the false positives *avoided* by H8 (i.e., correctly predicted as *no change*):\n*   **T1 `(1,3)`:** Adjacent to \"Right\" of Red block. Noise activating \"Right\" is `(0,8), (1,8), (3,4)`. None on row 1. Correctly no change.\n*   **T1 `(6,5)`:** Adjacent to \"Left\" of Yellow block. Noise activating \"Left\" is `(7,2), (8,3)`. None on row 6. Correctly no change.\n*   **T2 `(3,0)`:** Adjacent to \"Below\" Red block. Noise activating \"Below\" is `(3,4), (4,1), (8,2)`. None on col 0. Correctly no change.\n*   **T2 `(5,6)`:** Adjacent to \"Above\" Gray block. Noise activating \"Above\" is `(4,7), (5,4)`. None on col 6. Correctly no change.\n*   **T2 `(5,8)`:** Adjacent to \"Above\" Gray block. Noise activating \"Above\" is `(4,7), (5,4)`. None on col 8. Correctly no change.\n\nWhat is different between the false negatives `(2,3), (6,5), (8,5)` and the true negatives `(1,3), (6,5)_T1, (3,0), (5,6), (5,8)`?\n\nConsider the *corners* of the block.\n*   `(2,3)` is adjacent to the *side* `(2,2)` which is a corner of the Red block.\n*   `(6,5)` is adjacent to the *side* `(6,6)` which is a corner of the Gray block.\n*   `(8,5)` is adjacent to the *side* `(8,6)` which is a corner of the Gray block.\n\nNow look at the true negatives (H8 correctly predicts no change):\n*   `T1 (1,3)` is adjacent to `(1,2)` (middle of Red block edge).\n*   `T1 (6,5)` is adjacent to `(6,6)` (corner of Yellow block). Wait, this conflicts. Let's re-check T1/Yellow/Left. Noise: (7,2), (8,3). Active Left. Candidates: (6,5), (7,5), (8,5). H8 predicts change for (7,5) [aligned with (7,2)] and (8,5) [aligned with (8,3)]. H8 correctly predicts NO change for (6,5). Pixel (6,5) is adjacent to corner (6,6).\n*   `T2 (3,0)` is adjacent to `(2,0)` (corner of Red block).\n*   `T2 (5,6)` is adjacent to `(6,6)` (corner of Gray block).\n*   `T2 (5,8)` is adjacent to `(6,8)` (corner of Gray block).\n\nOkay, adjacency to a corner doesn't seem to be the deciding factor alone.\n\nLet's rethink the trigger. Maybe it's not *aligned* noise, but *any* noise in the active direction? (That was H7, which over-predicted).\n\nWhat if the expansion \"propagates\" from the corners?\nOr, what if we need noise alignment *or* some other condition?\n\nConsider the distance? No, that seems unlikely for ARC.\n\nLet's reconsider the concept of \"activating\" a side. H7/H8 defined \"active\" based on *any* noise beyond the boundary.\n*   T2, Red block, Right side: Noise `(0,8), (1,8), (3,4)` exist.\n*   T2, Gray block, Left side: Noise `(5,4), (7,0)` exist.\n\nWhat if the rule is: A candidate pixel `n` adjacent to side `S` changes IF *EITHER*:\n1.  (H8 condition) There exists noise `p` beyond side `S` aligned with `n`.\n2.  OR `n` is adjacent to a *corner* of the block, AND there exists noise `p` beyond the *two* sides forming that corner?\n\nLet's test this hypothetical H9:\n*   **T2 `(2,3)`** - False Negative for H8:\n    *   Adjacent to \"Right\" side. H8 fails (no aligned noise).\n    *   Is `(2,3)` adjacent to a corner? Yes, `(2,2)` (bottom-right corner of Red block).\n    *   Sides forming corner `(2,2)` are \"Right\" and \"Below\".\n    *   Is there noise beyond \"Right\"? Yes (`(0,8), (1,8), (3,4)`).\n    *   Is there noise beyond \"Below\"? Yes (`(3,4), (4,1), (8,2)`).\n    *   Condition 2 met? Yes. -> H9 predicts change. (Correct)\n*   **T2 `(6,5)`** - False Negative for H8:\n    *   Adjacent to \"Left\" side. H8 fails.\n    *   Adjacent to corner? Yes, `(6,6)` (top-left corner of Gray block).\n    *   Sides forming corner `(6,6)` are \"Left\" and \"Above\".\n    *   Noise beyond \"Left\"? Yes (`(5,4), (7,0)`).\n    *   Noise beyond \"Above\"? Yes (`(4,7), (5,4)`).\n    *   Condition 2 met? Yes. -> H9 predicts change. (Correct)\n*   **T2 `(8,5)`** - False Negative for H8:\n    *   Adjacent to \"Left\" side. H8 fails.\n    *   Adjacent to corner? Yes, `(8,6)` (bottom-left corner of Gray block).\n    *   Sides forming corner `(8,6)` are \"Left\" and \"Below\".\n    *   Noise beyond \"Left\"? Yes (`(5,4), (7,0)`).\n    *   Noise beyond \"Below\"? No noise below row 8.\n    *   Condition 2 met? No. -> H9 still predicts no change. (Incorrect - fails for (8,5))\n\nHypothesis 9 fails for `(8,5)`. Backtrack.\n\nWhat if the rule is simply: If a side `S` is \"active\" (has noise beyond its boundary), *all* background pixels adjacent to that side change color? This is essentially Hypothesis 7, which we know over-predicts.\n\nLet's focus on the difference between H7 (over-predicts) and the expected output.\n*   **T1 `(1,3)`:** H7 predicts change (Right active). Expected: no change.\n*   **T1 `(6,5)`:** H7 predicts change (Left active). Expected: no change.\n*   **T2 `(3,0)`:** H7 predicts change (Below active). Expected: no change.\n*   **T2 `(5,6)`:** H7 predicts change (Above active). Expected: no change.\n*   **T2 `(5,8)`:** H7 predicts change (Above active). Expected: no change.\n\nWhat characteristic do `(1,3), (6,5)_T1, (3,0), (5,6), (5,8)` share that prevents the change?\nAnd what characteristic do `(2,3), (6,5)_T2, (8,5)` share that *allows* the change even without strict H8 alignment?\n\nConsider the *number* of noise pixels activating a side? Doesn't seem consistent.\nConsider the *position* of the adjacent block pixel? Middle vs Corner?\n*   Pixels that *shouldn't* change (H7 False Positives):\n    *   `T1 (1,3)` adj. to `(1,2)` (Middle)\n    *   `T1 (6,5)` adj. to `(6,6)` (Corner)\n    *   `T2 (3,0)` adj. to `(2,0)` (Corner)\n    *   `T2 (5,6)` adj. to `(6,6)` (Corner)\n    *   `T2 (5,8)` adj. to `(6,8)` (Corner)\n*   Pixels that *should* change but fail H8 (H8 False Negatives):\n    *   `T2 (2,3)` adj. to `(2,2)` (Corner)\n    *   `T2 (6,5)` adj. to `(6,6)` (Corner)\n    *   `T2 (8,5)` adj. to `(8,6)` (Corner)\n\nThis is confusing. Adjacency to a corner doesn't seem deterministic.\n\nLet's reconsider H8 - Alignment. Could the definition of alignment be wrong?\nH8: `c_p == c_n` for Above/Below sides; `r_p == r_n` for Left/Right sides.\nWhat if alignment is defined differently?\n\nWhat if the rule is simpler: A pixel `n` adjacent to block `b` changes color if *any* noise pixel `p` of the same color exists such that `p` is \"in the direction\" of `n` relative to the block *center*? This was Hypothesis 2/3/6/7 territory which over-predicted.\n\nLet's look at the specific noise pixels again relative to the H8 false negatives:\n*   `T2 (2,3)` [Right of Red block]: Needs change. Activating noise: `(0,8), (1,8), (3,4)`. None have `r_p=2`.\n*   `T2 (6,5)` [Left of Gray block]: Needs change. Activating noise: `(5,4), (7,0)`. None have `r_p=6`.\n*   `T2 (8,5)` [Left of Gray block]: Needs change. Activating noise: `(5,4), (7,0)`. None have `r_p=8`.\n\nIs it possible the 3x3 block identification is wrong? No, seems robust.\nIs it possible the noise identification is wrong? No, seems robust.\n\nIs there a simpler pattern?\nLook at the output grids. The expanded blocks look like the original 3x3 block with some adjacent pixels filled in.\nThe filled-in pixels always form orthogonal extensions.\n*   T1 Red Block: Extends Right by 1 col (rows 0, 2) and Below by 1 row (cols 0, 1, 2).\n*   T1 Yellow Block: Extends Above by 1 row (cols 6, 7, 8) and Left by 1 col (rows 7, 8).\n*   T2 Red Block: Extends Right by 1 col (rows 0, 1, 2) and Below by 1 row (cols 1, 2).\n*   T2 Gray Block: Extends Above by 1 row (col 7) and Left by 1 col (rows 6, 7, 8).\n\nFocus on the pixels *not* filled in T2 where H7 predicted a change: `(3,0)`, `(5,6)`, `(5,8)`.\nFocus on the pixels filled in T2 where H8 predicted *no* change: `(2,3)`, `(6,5)`, `(8,5)`.\n\nMaybe the rule involves checking alignment *along the whole edge*?\nLet's define \"Side Noise Alignment\": For a side `S` (e.g., \"Right\", rows 0-2), does there exist noise `p` beyond side `S` such that `p` aligns with *any* pixel coordinate along that side?\n*   T2, Red Block (0,0)-(2,2)\n    *   Right Side (rows 0, 1, 2 at col 2): Noise beyond right: `(0,8), (1,8), (3,4)`.\n        *   Does noise exist with `r_p = 0`? Yes, `(0,8)`.\n        *   Does noise exist with `r_p = 1`? Yes, `(1,8)`.\n        *   Does noise exist with `r_p = 2`?

Yes, `(4,1)`.\n        *   Does noise exist with `c_p = 2`?

No.\n        *   Does noise exist with `c_p = 7`? Yes, `(4,7)`.\n        *   Does noise exist with `c_p = 8`? No.\n    *   Left Side (rows 6, 7, 8 at col 6): Noise left: `(5,4), (7,0)`.\n        *   Does noise exist with `r_p = 6`? No.\n        *   Does noise exist with `r_p = 7`? Yes, `(7,0)`.\n        *   Does noise exist with `r_p = 8`? No.\n\n**Hypothesis 9 (Revised): Side Activation by Aligned Noise**\nA background pixel `n` at `(r_n, c_n)` adjacent to side `S` of block `b` changes color IF:\n1.  There exists *any* noise pixel `p` beyond side `S`. (This activates the side generally, like H7).\n2.  AND there exists *at least one* noise pixel `p_align` beyond side `S` that aligns (row/column match) with *any* coordinate `(r_edge, c_edge)` belonging to the edge segment defined by side `S`.\n\nLet's test H9:\n*   **T2 Red Block:**\n    *   Right Side: Active (Noise exists beyond)? Yes. Aligned noise exists for rows 0 and 1? Yes (`(0,8)`, `(1,8)`). Rule: Change *all* pixels adjacent to Right side (rows 0, 1, 2)? Changes: `(0,3), (1,3), (2,3)`. (Matches expected!)\n    *   Below Side: Active? Yes. Aligned noise exists for cols 1 and 2? Yes (`(4,1)`, `(8,2)`). Rule: Change *all* pixels adjacent to Below side (cols 0, 1, 2)? Changes: `(3,0), (3,1), (3,2)`. (Over-predicts (3,0)!)\n\nHypothesis 9 also fails. It fixes the false negatives but reintroduces false positives.\n\nLet's combine H8 and H9(R)? What if a pixel `n` changes if EITHER H8 is true for `n`, OR `n` is adjacent to a corner activated on both sides (original H9)?\n\nHypothesis 10: Union of H8 and H9(original corner rule)\nPixel `n` changes if:\n1.

It's adjacent to corner `(8,6)`. Sides L, B. Noise exists beyond L, but not B. H8 alignment fails. H9corner fails.

Noise Red: `(0,8), (1,8), (3,4), (4,1), (8,2)`. The change happens at the bottom-right of the block's expansion zone. Noise exists to the right `(0,8), (1,8)` and below `(3,4), (4,1), (8,2)`.\n*   `T2 (6,5)`: Needs to be Gray. Gray block (6,6-8,8). Noise Gray: `(4,7), (5,4), (7,0)`.

Noise exists above `(4,7), (5,4)` and left `(5,4), (7,0)`.\n\nIs it related to corners where *both* adjacent sides are active?\n*   `T2 (2,3)`: Adj corner `(2,2)`. Sides R, B. Noise beyond R? Y. Noise beyond B? Y. => Change? Yes.\n*   `T2 (6,5)`: Adj corner `(6,6)`. Sides L, A. Noise beyond L? Y. Noise beyond A? Y. => Change? Yes.\n*   `T2 (8,5)`: Adj corner `(8,6)`. Sides L, B. Noise beyond L? Y. Noise beyond B? N. => Change? Yes.\n\nThis \"Both Sides Active Corner\" rule (H9 original) explained (2,3) and (6,5) but not (8,5).\n\nWhat if the rule is: Change pixel `n` if H8 is true OR if `n` is adjacent to a corner `C` where at least *one* of the two sides forming `C` has aligned noise (H8)?\nTest H12 = H8 OR (AdjCorner AND (Side1 has H8 alignment OR Side2 has H8 alignment))\n*   T2 (8,5): Adj Corner (8,6). Sides L, B. Does Side L have H8 alignment? Check noise Left `(5,4), (7,0)`. Does `r_p` align with `(6,6), (7,6), (8,6)`? Yes, `(7,0)` aligns with `(7,6)`. Does Side B have H8 alignment? Check noise Below (none). No. Since Side L has H8 alignment, condition 2 is met. -> H12 predicts change. (Correct!)\n\nLet's recheck the other H8 false negatives with H12:\n*   T2 (2,3): Adj Corner (2,2). Sides R, B. Does Side R have H8 alignment? Check noise Right `(0,8),(1,8),(3,4)`. Does `r_p` align with `(0,2),(1,2),(2,2)`? Yes, `(0,8)` aligns with `(0,2)`; `(1,8)` aligns with `(1,2)`. Yes. Condition 2 met. -> H12 predicts change. (Correct!)\n*   T2 (6,5): Adj Corner (6,6). Sides L, A. Does Side L have H8 alignment? Yes, `(7,0)` aligns with `(7,6)`. Does Side A have H8 alignment? Yes, `(4,7)` aligns with `(6,7)`. Yes. Condition 2 met. -> H12 predicts change. (Correct!)\n\nNow check H12 on the H7 False Positives (where H8 correctly predicted no change):\n*   T1 `(1,3)`: Adj side R. H8 fails. Adj corner? No. -> H12 predicts no change (Correct).\n*   T1 `(6,5)`: Adj side L. H8 fails. Adj corner `(6,6)`. Sides L, A. Does Side L have H8 alignment (for rows 6,7,8)? Noise L `(7,2),(8,3)`.

Yes, `(1,6)` aligns with `(6,6)`, `(1,7)` aligns with `(6,7)`, `(0,8)` aligns with `(6,8)`. Yes. Condition 2 met. -> H12 predicts change (INCORRECT).\n\nHypothesis 12 fails. The interaction is more complex.\n\nLet's go back to the simplest rule that worked for T1: H8. Strict Alignment.\nRule: Pixel `n` changes if adjacent to side `S` and noise `p` exists beyond `S` AND `p` aligns with `n`.\nThis fails for T2 `(2,3), (6,5), (8,5)`.\n\nConsider the *shape* of the expansion. It seems to fill a rectangle defined by the block and the outermost aligned noise pixels.\n*   T2 Red block (0,0)-(2,2). Noise R: `(0,8), (1,8), (3,4)`. Noise B: `(3,4), (4,1), (8,2)`.\n    *   Max row of Right noise = 3. Max col = 8.\n    *   Max row of Below noise = 8. Max col = 4.\n    *   H8 aligned noise R: `(0,8)` (aligns with `(0,3)`), `(1,8)` (aligns with `(1,3)`). Max row = 1.\n    *   H8 aligned noise B: `(4,1)` (aligns with `(3,1)`), `(8,2)` (aligns with `(3,2)`). Max col = 2.\n    *   Expansion Right occurs up to row 1. Expansion Below occurs up to col 2.\n    *   This implies changes at `(0,3), (1,3), (3,1), (3,2)`. Still misses `(2,3)`.\n\n*   T2 Gray block (6,6)-(8,8). Noise A: `(4,7), (5,4)`. Noise L: `(5,4), (7,0)`.\n    *   Min row of Above noise = 4. Max col = 7.\n    *   Min col of Left noise = 0. Max row = 7.\n    *   H8 aligned noise A: `(4,7)` (aligns with `(5,7)`). Min row = 4.\n    *   H8 aligned noise L: `(7,0)` (aligns with `(7,5)`). Min col = 0.\n    *   Expansion Above occurs down to row 4? No, only at col 7. Expansion Left occurs up to col 0? No, only at row 7.\n    *   This implies changes at `(5,7), (7,5)`. Still misses `(6,5), (8,5)`.\n\nMaybe the expansion fills the bounding box defined by the block AND *all* noise pixels?\n*   T2 Red block (0,0)-(2,2). All Red Noise `(0,8), (1,8), (3,4), (4,1), (8,2)`.\n    *   Overall bounds: min r=0, max r=8, min c=0, max c=8. -> Fills everything? No.\n*   T2 Gray block (6,6)-(8,8). All Gray Noise `(4,7), (5,4), (7,0)`.\n    *   Overall bounds: min r=4, max r=8, min c=0, max c=8. -> Fills everything? No.\n\nRevisit H8. It perfectly explains Train 1. It fails only on 3 pixels in Train 2. Let's assume H8 is the *primary* rule, and there's a secondary, minor rule or exception for those 3 pixels.\nThe 3 pixels are `(2,3)`, `(6,5)`, `(8,5)`. All are adjacent to corners of their respective blocks.\nMaybe the rule is: H8 OR (AdjacentToCorner AND Side1IsActive AND Side2IsActive)? (This was H9 original, failed on (8,5)).\n\nLet's stick with H8 as the most robust hypothesis identified so far, acknowledging it fails on 3 specific pixels in one example. The task might have noise or ambiguity, or H8 captures the main intent. The coder phase can implement H8, and if it fails validation, we revisit.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
