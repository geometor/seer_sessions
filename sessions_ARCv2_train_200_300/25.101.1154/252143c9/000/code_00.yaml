task_context:
  - description: Transform an input grid based on identifying a central feature and drawing a diagonal line.
  - grid_properties:
      - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
      - Orange (7) acts as the background color in the output and is often the most frequent color in the input.

identified_objects:
  - object: Central Pixel
    description: The non-background pixel closest to the geometric center of the input grid.
    properties:
      - location: (r_c, c_c)
      - color: C (input[r_c][c_c])
      - constraints: Must not be the background color (orange=7). Ties in distance resolved by top-most, then left-most.
  - object: Background
    description: The default color used to fill the output grid initially.
    properties:
      - color: Orange (7)
  - object: Output Line Segment
    description: A segment of an anti-diagonal line drawn on the output grid.
    properties:
      - color: C (derived from the Central Pixel)
      - geometry: Anti-diagonal (r + c = r_c + c_c)
      - location: A subset of the full anti-diagonal, determined by the Central Pixel's location and color parity.

transformations:
  - action: Identify Background Color
    input: input_grid
    output: background_color (assumed Orange=7)
  - action: Calculate Geometric Center
    input: grid_dimensions (height, width)
    output: center_coords (center_r, center_c)
  - action: Find Central Pixel
    input: input_grid, background_color, center_coords
    output: central_pixel_location (r_c, c_c), central_pixel_color (C)
    details: Finds the non-background pixel closest to center_coords (Manhattan distance, tie-break with min row, then min col).
  - action: Initialize Output Grid
    input: grid_dimensions, background_color
    output: output_grid (filled with background_color)
  - action: Determine Line Segment Parameters
    input: central_pixel_location (r_c, c_c), central_pixel_color (C)
    output: anti_diagonal_sum (S = r_c + c_c), direction_rule (based on C parity)
  - action: Draw Line Segment
    input: output_grid, anti_diagonal_sum (S), central_pixel_location (r_c, c_c), central_pixel_color (C), direction_rule
    output: modified output_grid
    details: Iterates through grid cells (r, c). If r + c == S and the cell satisfies the direction rule (relative to (r_c, c_c) based on C's parity), set output[r][c] = C.

relationships:
  - The color of the Output Line Segment is determined by the color of the Central Pixel found in the input.
  - The location of the Output Line Segment is determined by the location of the Central Pixel (it lies on the anti-diagonal passing through it).
  - The extent and direction of the Output Line Segment along the anti-diagonal depend on the parity of the Central Pixel's color.
  - All pixels in the output grid not belonging to the Output Line Segment are set to the Background color.
