The direction of extension seems dependent on the parity (even or odd) of the color of the central pixel.\nAll pixels not part of this drawn line segment are set to the background color (orange).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Let `C` be the color of the identified pixel `input[r_c][c_c]`.\n6.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions (H, W) as the input grid, and fill it entirely with the background color (orange=7).\n7.  Calculate the anti-diagonal sum `S = r_c + c_c`.\n8.
