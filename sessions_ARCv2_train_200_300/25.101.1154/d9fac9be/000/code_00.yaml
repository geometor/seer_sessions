elements:
  - role: input
    type: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors (0-9). Contains multiple colors, including white (0).
  - role: output
    type: color_value
    description: A single integer representing a color (0-9). This color is derived from the input grid.
task_logic:
  - process: analyze_frequency
    description: Count the occurrences of each distinct non-white color within the input grid.
  - process: find_minimum_frequency
    description: Identify the minimum count among all non-white colors.
  - process: identify_candidates
    description: Find all non-white colors that have this minimum frequency count.
  - process: select_output
    description: >
      If only one color has the minimum frequency, that color is the output.
      If multiple colors share the minimum frequency (a tie), the output is the color with the smallest numerical value among those tied candidates.
relationships:
  - input_grid -> color_counts -> minimum_count -> candidate_colors -> output_color
properties:
  - white_color (0): Ignored during frequency analysis.
  - non_white_colors: The colors considered for frequency counting and output selection.
  - minimum_frequency: The lowest count observed among non-white colors.
  - tie_breaking_rule: Select the smallest numerical color value in case of a frequency tie.
