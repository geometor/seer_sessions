Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception

The input is always a grid of pixels with varying dimensions and colors. The output is always a single pixel, represented by its color value (an integer from 0-9).

Observing the examples:
1.  The output color is always present in the input grid.
2.  The background color (white, 0) seems irrelevant to determining the output color.
3.  The task appears to involve analyzing the frequency of the non-white colors within the input grid.

Let's count the non-white pixel occurrences in each example:

*   **train_1:**
    *   Blue (1): 6
    *   Red (2): 13
    *   Output: 1 (Blue). Blue is the least frequent color.
*   **train_2:**
    *   Green (3): 9
    *   Azure (8): 8
    *   Output: 8 (Azure). Azure is the least frequent color.
*   **train_3:**
    *   Green (3): 16
    *   Azure (8): 9
    *   Output: 8 (Azure). Azure is the least frequent color.
*   **train_4:**
    *   Red (2): 9
    *   Yellow (4): 9
    *   Output: 2 (Red). Red and Yellow have the same frequency (9), which is the minimum frequency. The output is the smaller of the two color values (2 < 4).

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be: find the non-white color(s) that appear the minimum number of times in the input grid. If there is only one such color, that is the output. If there is a tie (multiple colors share the minimum frequency), the output is the color with the smallest numerical value among the tied colors.

## Facts


```yaml
elements:
  - role: input
    type: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors (0-9). Contains multiple colors, including white (0).
  - role: output
    type: color_value
    description: A single integer representing a color (0-9). This color is derived from the input grid.
task_logic:
  - process: analyze_frequency
    description: Count the occurrences of each distinct non-white color within the input grid.
  - process: find_minimum_frequency
    description: Identify the minimum count among all non-white colors.
  - process: identify_candidates
    description: Find all non-white colors that have this minimum frequency count.
  - process: select_output
    description: >
      If only one color has the minimum frequency, that color is the output.
      If multiple colors share the minimum frequency (a tie), the output is the color with the smallest numerical value among those tied candidates.
relationships:
  - input_grid -> color_counts -> minimum_count -> candidate_colors -> output_color
properties:
  - white_color (0): Ignored during frequency analysis.
  - non_white_colors: The colors considered for frequency counting and output selection.
  - minimum_frequency: The lowest count observed among non-white colors.
  - tie_breaking_rule: Select the smallest numerical color value in case of a frequency tie.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Create a frequency map (or counter) to store the counts of each color present in the input grid, excluding the white color (0).
3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
4.  If a pixel's color is not white (0), increment its count in the frequency map.
5.  After counting all non-white pixels, find the minimum frequency count recorded in the map.
6.  Identify all colors in the map that have this minimum frequency count.
7.  If there is only one color with the minimum frequency, return that color's value as the output.
8.  If there are multiple colors with the minimum frequency (a tie), find the smallest numerical value among these tied colors and return it as the output.
