The output is always a single pixel, represented by its color value (an integer from 0-9).\n\nObserving the examples:\n1.  The output color is always present in the input grid.\n2.  The background color (white, 0) seems irrelevant to determining the output color.\n3.  The task appears to involve analyzing the frequency of the non-white colors within the input grid.\n\nLet's count the non-white pixel occurrences in each example:\n\n*   **train_1:**\n    *   Blue (1): 6\n    *   Red (2): 13\n    *   Output: 1 (Blue). Blue is the least frequent color.\n*   **train_2:**\n    *   Green (3): 9\n    *   Azure (8): 8\n    *   Output: 8 (Azure). Azure is the least frequent color.\n*   **train_3:**\n    *   Green (3): 16\n    *   Azure (8): 9\n    *   Output: 8 (Azure). Azure is the least frequent color.\n*   **train_4:**\n    *   Red (2): 9\n    *   Yellow (4): 9\n    *   Output: 2 (Red). Red and Yellow have the same frequency (9), which is the minimum frequency. The output is the smaller of the two color values (2 < 4).\n\nBased on these observations, the rule seems to be: find the non-white color(s) that appear the minimum number of times in the input grid. If there is only one such color, that is the output. If there is a tie (multiple colors share the minimum frequency), the output is the color with the smallest numerical value among the tied colors.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
