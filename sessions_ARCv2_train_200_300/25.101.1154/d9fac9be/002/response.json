            "text": "**General Assessment & Strategy**\n\nThe initial code successfully identified the minimum frequency rule but used an incorrect tie-breaking mechanism (smallest color value). The failure on Example 2, where the expected output was 8 despite 3 being the smaller value in a frequency tie, revealed this flaw. The subsequent analysis, including code-based metric gathering, showed that Example 4 also involved a tie, but the expected output (2) aligned with the 'smallest value' rule, creating a contradiction if only considering color values.\n\nThe revised strategy incorporates the concept of \"objects\" (contiguous blocks of the same color connected horizontally/vertically). The updated hypothesis is that ties in minimum pixel frequency are broken by selecting the color that forms the *maximum* number of distinct objects. This hypothesis successfully explains the outputs for all training examples, including the previously contradictory tie-breaker results in Examples 2 and 4. The strategy is to first find colors with minimum pixel frequency, and if there's a tie, apply the maximum object count rule as the tie-breaker.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nThe following metrics were gathered using code execution to ensure accuracy:\n\n| Example | Input Grid Dim | Non-White Colors | Pixel Counts       | Min Freq | Freq Candidates | Object Counts      | Max Objects Candidate | Expected Output |\n| :------ | :------------- | :--------------- | :----------------- | :------- | :-------------- | :----------------- | :-------------------- | :-------------- |\n| 1       | 11x9           | 1 (Blue), 2 (Red) | {1: 9, 2: 19}      | 9        | [1]             | {1: 8, 2: 12}      | 1                     | 1               |\n| 2       | 7x9            | 8 (Azure), 3 (Green) | {8: 10, 3: 10}     | 10       | [3, 8]          | {8: 10, 3: 3}      | 8                     | 8               |\n| 3       | 11x12          | 8 (Azure), 3 (Green) | {8: 10, 3: 20}     | 10       | [8]             | {8: 10, 3: 11}     | 8                     | 8               |\n| 4       | 5x9            | 2 (Red), 4 (Yellow)| {2: 8, 4: 8}       | 8        | [2, 4]          | {2: 8, 4: 1}       | 2                     | 2               |\n\n*Notes:*\n*   Pixel Counts: Total number of times each non-white color appears.\n*   Min Freq: The lowest pixel count found.\n*   Freq Candidates: Color(s) matching the Min Freq.\n*   Object Counts: Number of distinct contiguous (non-diagonal) groups for each color.\n*   Max Objects Candidate: Among Freq Candidates, the color with the highest Object Count.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
