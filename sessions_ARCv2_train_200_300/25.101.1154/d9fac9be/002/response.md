**General Assessment & Strategy**

The initial code successfully identified the minimum frequency rule but used an incorrect tie-breaking mechanism (smallest color value). The failure on Example 2, where the expected output was 8 despite 3 being the smaller value in a frequency tie, revealed this flaw. The subsequent analysis, including code-based metric gathering, showed that Example 4 also involved a tie, but the expected output (2) aligned with the 'smallest value' rule, creating a contradiction if only considering color values.

The revised strategy incorporates the concept of "objects" (contiguous blocks of the same color connected horizontally/vertically). The updated hypothesis is that ties in minimum pixel frequency are broken by selecting the color that forms the *maximum* number of distinct objects. This hypothesis successfully explains the outputs for all training examples, including the previously contradictory tie-breaker results in Examples 2 and 4. The strategy is to first find colors with minimum pixel frequency, and if there's a tie, apply the maximum object count rule as the tie-breaker.

**Metrics**

The following metrics were gathered using code execution to ensure accuracy:

| Example | Input Grid Dim | Non-White Colors | Pixel Counts       | Min Freq | Freq Candidates | Object Counts      | Max Objects Candidate | Expected Output |
| :------ | :------------- | :--------------- | :----------------- | :------- | :-------------- | :----------------- | :-------------------- | :-------------- |
| 1       | 11x9           | 1 (Blue), 2 (Red) | {1: 9, 2: 19}      | 9        | [1]             | {1: 8, 2: 12}      | 1                     | 1               |
| 2       | 7x9            | 8 (Azure), 3 (Green) | {8: 10, 3: 10}     | 10       | [3, 8]          | {8: 10, 3: 3}      | 8                     | 8               |
| 3       | 11x12          | 8 (Azure), 3 (Green) | {8: 10, 3: 20}     | 10       | [8]             | {8: 10, 3: 11}     | 8                     | 8               |
| 4       | 5x9            | 2 (Red), 4 (Yellow)| {2: 8, 4: 8}       | 8        | [2, 4]          | {2: 8, 4: 1}       | 2                     | 2               |

*Notes:*
*   Pixel Counts: Total number of times each non-white color appears.
*   Min Freq: The lowest pixel count found.
*   Freq Candidates: Color(s) matching the Min Freq.
*   Object Counts: Number of distinct contiguous (non-diagonal) groups for each color.
*   Max Objects Candidate: Among Freq Candidates, the color with the highest Object Count.

    description: >
      The output color is the one identified either directly by unique minimum pixel frequency,
      or by having the maximum number of objects among those tied for minimum pixel frequency.
      (The examples show this resolves the tie uniquely).
relationships:
  - input_grid -> pixel_counts -> minimum_pixel_frequency -> frequency_candidates
  - frequency_candidates -> select_output (if unique candidate based on frequency)
  - frequency_candidates -> object_counts (for tied candidates) -> maximum_object_count -> select_output (candidate with max objects)

  - white_color (0): Ignored during pixel and object analysis.
  - non_white_colors: Colors considered for frequency/object counting and output selection (values 1-9).
  - minimum_pixel_frequency: The lowest pixel count observed among non-white colors.
  - maximum_object_count: The highest object count used as a tie-breaker among colors with minimum pixel frequency.
  - connectivity: Horizontal and vertical adjacency defines objects; diagonal adjacency does not.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Initialize a data structure (e.g., a dictionary or map) to store the count of each non-white pixel color (colors 1 through 9).
3.  Iterate through every pixel in the input grid. If a pixel's color is not white (0), increment the count for that color in the data structure.
4.  Determine the minimum count value recorded across all counted colors.
5.  Identify all colors that have this minimum count. These are the primary candidates.
6.  If exactly one color is identified as a primary candidate, return that color's value as the final output.
7.  If multiple colors are identified as primary candidates (i.e., there is a tie for the minimum pixel count):
    a.  For each of these tied candidate colors, calculate the number of distinct, contiguous objects formed by that color within the grid. An object consists of one or more pixels of the same color connected horizontally and/or vertically (not diagonally).
    b.  Compare the object counts calculated for the tied candidate colors.
    c.  Identify the candidate color that corresponds to the highest object count.
    d.  Return the value of this color (the one with the maximum number of objects among those tied for minimum pixel frequency) as the final output.
