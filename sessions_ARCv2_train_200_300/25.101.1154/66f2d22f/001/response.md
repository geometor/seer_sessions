"""
Transforms an input grid by comparing corresponding pixels from its left and right halves.
The input grid is assumed to have an even width. It is split vertically into two equal halves.
An output grid is generated with the same height as the input and half its width.
For each position (r, c) in the output grid, the corresponding pixels in the left half (r, c) and right half (r, c + half_width) of the input grid are examined.
If both these input pixels are white (0), the output pixel at (r, c) is set to gray (5).
Otherwise, the output pixel at (r, c) is set to white (0).
