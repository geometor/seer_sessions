Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are grids of single digits, represented as rows of space-separated numbers. The number of columns (11) is consistent across all examples, while the number of rows can vary.
2.  **Key Columns:** Columns 3 and 7 in the input consistently contain the digit 5 (except possibly in rows that are entirely 5s). These columns remain 5 in the output in the corresponding positions. Columns 1, 5, and 9 in the input seem to hold 'signal' digits that influence the output. The remaining columns (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) mostly contain 0s in the input.
3.  **Output Structure:** The output grid consists of blocks of identical digits. Specifically, columns 0-2 form a block, columns 4-6 form a block, and columns 8-10 form a block. Columns 3 and 7 act as separators between these blocks, holding the digit 5.
4.  **Transformation Logic:** The digits appearing in the output blocks seem related to the signal digits in columns 1, 5, and 9 of the input. Comparing input and output:
    *   `train_1`: Input row 1 has `3` (col 1), `1` (col 5), `4` (col 9). Output rows have `8` (cols 0-2), `6` (cols 4-6), `9` (cols 8-10). The transformation appears to be `output_digit = input_digit + 5`.
    *   `train_2`: Input row 1 has `2` (col 1), `3` (col 5), `1` (col 9). Output rows have `7` (cols 0-2), `8` (cols 4-6), `6` (cols 8-10). Again, `output_digit = input_digit + 5`.
    *   `train_4`: Input row 1 has `1` (col 1), `2` (col 5), `1` (col 9). Output rows have `6` (cols 0-2), `7` (cols 4-6), `6` (cols 8-10). The rule `output_digit = input_digit + 5` holds.
5.  **Row Propagation:** The output pattern derived from the signal digits in *one* input row is applied to *all* output rows within a specific section.
6.  **Sections and Separators:** `train_3` introduces a row composed entirely of 5s. This row acts as a separator, appearing unchanged in the output. The transformation rule is applied independently to the sections above and below this separator row. The signal digits for the first section come from input row 1, and the signal digits for the second section come from input row 5.
7.  **Zero Handling:** Input 0s in the block columns (0-2, 4-6, 8-10) are replaced by the calculated block digits. Input 0s in the signal columns (1, 5, 9) seem irrelevant unless they are the *only* digit present in those columns within a section's signal row (which doesn't happen in the examples; the signal rows always have non-zero digits in columns 1, 5, 9).

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 2D array of single digits.
  Dimensions: Fixed 11 columns, variable rows.
Objects:
  - Name: Signal Digit
    Location: Input grid, columns 1, 5, 9. Usually non-zero in specific rows.
    Property: Determines the value of output blocks.
  - Name: Constant Digit
    Location: Input grid, columns 3, 7. Value is 5.
    Property: Remains unchanged in the output (except in separator rows).
  - Name: Filler Digit
    Location: Input grid, primarily 0s in columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.
    Property: Replaced in the output.
  - Name: Output Block
    Location: Output grid, columns 0-2, 4-6, 8-10.
    Property: Contains uniform digits derived from signal digits.
  - Name: Separator Row
    Location: Input grid, a row consisting entirely of 5s.
    Property: Divides the grid into sections; remains unchanged in the output.
Relationships:
  - Output block value (cols 0-2) is determined by the signal digit in column 1 + 5.
  - Output block value (cols 4-6) is determined by the signal digit in column 5 + 5.
  - Output block value (cols 8-10) is determined by the signal digit in column 9 + 5.
Actions:
  - Identify separator rows (all 5s).
  - Partition the grid into sections based on separators.
  - For each section:
    - Locate the 'key' input row containing non-zero signal digits (in columns 1, 5, 9).
    - Extract the signal digits (d1, d5, d9) from this key row.
    - Calculate the output block values (o1 = d1+5, o5 = d5+5, o9 = d9+5).
    - Populate all rows of the output section: cols 0-2 with o1, col 3 with 5, cols 4-6 with o5, col 7 with 5, cols 8-10 with o9.
  - Copy separator rows directly to the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input grid.
2.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions.
3.  Identify the indices of any rows in the input grid that consist entirely of the digit 5. Mark these as separator rows.
4.  Define sections as contiguous blocks of rows between separator rows (or grid boundaries).
5.  Iterate through each section:
    a.  Within the current section of the input grid, find the first row that contains non-zero digits in columns 1, 5, *and* 9 (or simply the row containing the determining signal digits, assuming only one such row exists per section based on examples). Let this be the 'key row'.
    b.  Get the digit from the key row at column 1 (`d1`).
    c.  Get the digit from the key row at column 5 (`d5`).
    d.  Get the digit from the key row at column 9 (`d9`).
    e.  Calculate the output values: `o1 = d1 + 5`, `o5 = d5 + 5`, `o9 = d9 + 5`.
    f.  For each row index belonging to the current section:
        i.  Fill columns 0, 1, 2 of the corresponding output row with `o1`.
        ii. Fill column 3 of the output row with 5.
        iii. Fill columns 4, 5, 6 of the output row with `o5`.
        iv. Fill column 7 of the output row with 5.
        v. Fill columns 8, 9, 10 of the output row with `o9`.
6.  For each separator row index identified in step 3, copy the entire row from the input grid to the corresponding row in the output grid.
7.  Return the completed output grid.
