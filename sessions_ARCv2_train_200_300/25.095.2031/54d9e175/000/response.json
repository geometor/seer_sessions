            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are grids of single digits, represented as rows of space-separated numbers. The number of columns (11) is consistent across all examples, while the number of rows can vary.\n2.  **Key Columns:** Columns 3 and 7 in the input consistently contain the digit 5 (except possibly in rows that are entirely 5s). These columns remain 5 in the output in the corresponding positions. Columns 1, 5, and 9 in the input seem to hold 'signal' digits that influence the output. The remaining columns (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) mostly contain 0s in the input.\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output grid consists of blocks of identical digits. Specifically, columns 0-2 form a block, columns 4-6 form a block, and columns 8-10 form a block. Columns 3 and 7 act as separators between these blocks, holding the digit 5.\n4.  **Transformation Logic:** The digits appearing in the output blocks seem related to the signal digits in columns 1, 5, and 9 of the input. Comparing input and output:\n    *   `train_1`: Input row 1 has `3` (col 1), `1` (col 5), `4` (col 9). Output rows have `8` (cols 0-2), `6` (cols 4-6), `9` (cols 8-10). The transformation appears to be `output_digit = input_digit + 5`.\n    *   `train_2`: Input row 1 has `2` (col 1), `3` (col 5), `1` (col 9). Output rows have `7` (cols 0-2), `8` (cols 4-6), `6` (cols 8-10). Again, `output_digit = input_digit + 5`.\n    *   `train_4`: Input row 1 has `1` (col 1), `2` (col 5), `1` (col 9). Output rows have `6` (cols 0-2), `7` (cols 4-6), `6` (cols 8-10). The rule `output_digit = input_digit + 5` holds.\n5.  **Row Propagation:** The output pattern derived from the signal digits in *one* input row is applied to *all* output rows within a specific section.\n6.  **Sections and Separators:** `train_3` introduces a row composed entirely of 5s. This row acts as a separator, appearing unchanged in the output. The transformation rule is applied independently to the sections above and below this separator row. The signal digits for the first section come from input row 1, and the signal digits for the second section come from input row 5.\n7.  **Zero Handling:** Input 0s in the block columns (0-2, 4-6, 8-10) are replaced by the calculated block digits. Input 0s in the signal columns (1, 5, 9) seem irrelevant unless they are the *only* digit present in those columns within a section's signal row (which doesn't happen in the examples; the signal rows always have non-zero digits in columns 1, 5, 9).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
