Grid:
  Type: 2D array of single digits.
  Dimensions: Fixed 11 columns, variable rows.
Objects:
  - Name: Signal Digit
    Location: Input grid, columns 1, 5, 9. Usually non-zero in specific rows.
    Property: Determines the value of output blocks.
  - Name: Constant Digit
    Location: Input grid, columns 3, 7. Value is 5.
    Property: Remains unchanged in the output (except in separator rows).
  - Name: Filler Digit
    Location: Input grid, primarily 0s in columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.
    Property: Replaced in the output.
  - Name: Output Block
    Location: Output grid, columns 0-2, 4-6, 8-10.
    Property: Contains uniform digits derived from signal digits.
  - Name: Separator Row
    Location: Input grid, a row consisting entirely of 5s.
    Property: Divides the grid into sections; remains unchanged in the output.
Relationships:
  - Output block value (cols 0-2) is determined by the signal digit in column 1 + 5.
  - Output block value (cols 4-6) is determined by the signal digit in column 5 + 5.
  - Output block value (cols 8-10) is determined by the signal digit in column 9 + 5.
Actions:
  - Identify separator rows (all 5s).
  - Partition the grid into sections based on separators.
  - For each section:
    - Locate the 'key' input row containing non-zero signal digits (in columns 1, 5, 9).
    - Extract the signal digits (d1, d5, d9) from this key row.
    - Calculate the output block values (o1 = d1+5, o5 = d5+5, o9 = d9+5).
    - Populate all rows of the output section: cols 0-2 with o1, col 3 with 5, cols 4-6 with o5, col 7 with 5, cols 8-10 with o9.
  - Copy separator rows directly to the output.
