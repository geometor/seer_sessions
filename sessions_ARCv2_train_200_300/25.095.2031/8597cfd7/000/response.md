*   **Perception:**
    *   The input is a rectangular grid of digits.
    *   The digit 0 appears to be a background filler.
    *   The digit 5 consistently forms a single, solid horizontal line spanning the width of the grid. This line acts as a horizontal separator.
    *   The digits 2 and 4 appear in specific vertical columns (column index 2 for '2', column index 6 for '4') above and below the line of 5s.
    *   The output is always a 2x2 grid filled uniformly with a single digit, either 2 or 4.
    *   The digit chosen for the output grid depends on the relative frequency of digits 2 and 4 located *below* the horizontal line of 5s in the input grid.

    task_elements:
      - input_grid:
          type: object
          description: A 2D grid of integers.
          properties:
            - cells: Contains integer values (0, 2, 4, 5).
            - dimensions: Variable number of rows, fixed number of columns (9).
      - separator_line:
          type: object
          description: A horizontal line within the input_grid.
          properties:
            - value: Composed entirely of the digit 5.
            - position: Spans the full width of the grid at a specific row index.
            - function: Divides the grid into an upper and lower section.
      - target_digits:
          type: list
          description: The digits whose occurrences are compared.
          items: [2, 4]
      - comparison_zone:
          type: region
          description: The area of the input_grid below the separator_line.
      - counts:
          type: property
          description: Number of occurrences of target_digits within the comparison_zone.
          properties:
            - count_2: Integer count of digit 2 below the separator_line.
            - count_4: Integer count of digit 4 below the separator_line.
      - output_grid:
          type: object
          description: A 2x2 grid filled with a single digit.
          properties:
            - dimensions: Fixed 2x2 size.
            - fill_value: Either 2 or 4, determined by comparing count_2 and count_4.
    relationships:
      - The comparison_zone is defined relative to the separator_line.
      - The fill_value of the output_grid is determined by the relationship (comparison) between count_2 and count_4.
    actions:
      - locate: Find the row index of the separator_line (the line of 5s).
      - isolate: Define the subgrid below the separator_line.
      - count: Tally occurrences of digit 2 and digit 4 within the isolated subgrid.
      - compare: Determine which digit (2 or 4) has a higher count. If counts are equal, digit 2 is chosen.
      - generate: Create a 2x2 grid filled with the digit determined by the comparison.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the row in the input grid that consists entirely of the digit 5. This is the separator line.
    2.  Isolate the portion of the input grid located below this separator line.
    3.  Count the total number of occurrences of the digit 2 within this lower portion.
    4.  Count the total number of occurrences of the digit 4 within this lower portion.
    5.  Compare the count of 2s and the count of 4s:
        *   If the count of 2s is greater than or equal to the count of 4s, select the digit 2 as the result.
        *   If the count of 4s is greater than the count of 2s, select the digit 4 as the result.
    6.  Construct a 2x2 output grid where every cell is filled with the selected result digit (either 2 or 4).
