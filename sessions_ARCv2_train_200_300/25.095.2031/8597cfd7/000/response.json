This line acts as a horizontal separator.\n    *   The digits 2 and 4 appear in specific vertical columns (column index 2 for '2', column index 6 for '4') above and below the line of 5s.\n    *   The output is always a 2x2 grid filled uniformly with a single digit, either 2 or 4.\n    *   The digit chosen for the output grid depends on the relative frequency of digits 2 and 4 located *below* the horizontal line of 5s in the input grid.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
