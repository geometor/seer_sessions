Objects:
  - InputGrid:
      type: matrix (3 rows, N columns)
      properties:
        - rows: 3
        - elements: integers
        - row_1: all zeros
        - row_2: contains initial non-zero values followed by zeros (mostly)
        - row_3: all zeros
  - OutputGrid:
      type: matrix (3 rows, N columns)
      properties:
        - rows: 3
        - elements: integers
        - row_1: all zeros (copy of input row_1)
        - row_2: modified version of input row_2
        - row_3: all zeros (copy of input row_3)
  - KeyElements:
      source: InputGrid row_2
      elements:
        - A: value at index 0
        - B: value at index 1
  - IndexSequences:
      description: Used to determine placement positions for copies of A and B.
      sequence_A:
        type: arithmetic progression
        start_offset: 3
        common_difference: 4
        terms: [3, 7, 11, 15, ...]
      sequence_B:
        type: arithmetic progression
        start_offset: 5
        common_difference: 4
        terms: [5, 9, 13, 17, ...]

Relationships:
  - OutputGrid is derived from InputGrid.
  - OutputGrid rows 1 and 3 are identical copies of InputGrid rows 1 and 3.
  - OutputGrid row 2 initially copies InputGrid row 2.
  - Copies of KeyElement A are placed in OutputGrid row 2 at indices determined by cumulatively adding offsets from sequence_A to the previous placement index of A (starting from index 0).
  - Copies of KeyElement B are placed in OutputGrid row 2 at indices determined by cumulatively adding offsets from sequence_B to the previous placement index of B (starting from index 1).

Actions:
  - Identify KeyElements A and B from InputGrid row 2.
  - Copy InputGrid to OutputGrid.
  - Iterate using IndexSequences A and B:
    - Calculate the next target index for A.
    - Calculate the next target index for B.
    - If the target index is within the row bounds, place the corresponding KeyElement (A or B) at that index in OutputGrid row 2.
    - Update the current position and the next offset for A and B.
  - Stop when target indices exceed row bounds.
