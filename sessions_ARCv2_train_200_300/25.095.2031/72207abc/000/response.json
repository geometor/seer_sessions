            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids (matrices) of numbers, specifically 3 rows high. The width varies between examples.\n2.  **Static Rows:** The first and third rows consist entirely of zeros in both the input and the output. They appear unchanged by the transformation.\n3.  **Active Row:** The second row is where the transformation occurs.\n4.  **Key Input Values:** In the input's second row, the first two elements seem crucial. Let's call the element at index 0 'A' and the element at index 1 'B'. In all examples, these are non-zero, while subsequent elements are initially zero (except for `train_1` which has a `1` at index 3).\n5.  **Transformation Goal:** The output's second row starts identically to the input's second row but then has additional copies of 'A' and 'B' placed at specific indices further down the row.\n6.  **Placement Pattern (from train\\_2 & train\\_3):**\n    *   Copies of 'A' appear at indices calculated by adding an arithmetic sequence of offsets (3, 7, 11, ...) to the previous position of 'A'.\n    *   Copies of 'B' appear at indices calculated by adding an arithmetic sequence of offsets (5, 9, 13, ...) to the previous position of 'B'.\n    *   Both offset sequences start with a specific value (3 for A, 5 for B) and increase by 4 in each step.\n7.  **Anomaly (train\\_1):** The output for `train_1` (`[6 8 0 1 0 0 6 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0]`) doesn't perfectly fit the pattern observed in `train_2` and `train_3`. The element `1` at index 3 is also repeated, and the positions of the repeated `6` and `8` don't match the arithmetic sequence derived from the other examples. However, the pattern from `train_2` and `train_3` is internally consistent and simpler. I will proceed with the hypothesis based on `train_2` and `train_3`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
