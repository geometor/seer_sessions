```python
"""
Transforms the input grid based on a pattern observed in the second row.
Specifically, it identifies the first two elements (A and B) of the second row.
It then iteratively places copies of A and B further down the second row at indices
determined by adding accumulating offsets. The offset for A starts at 3 and increases
by 4 each time. The offset for B starts at 5 and increases by 4 each time.
The first and third rows remain unchanged (assumed to be all zeros).
