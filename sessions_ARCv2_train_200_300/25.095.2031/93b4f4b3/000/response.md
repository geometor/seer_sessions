Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input is consistently a grid of numbers with an even number of columns. The number of rows varies.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output is a grid of numbers with the same number of rows as the input, but exactly half the number of columns.
3.  **Spatial Relationship:** The input grid appears to be composed of two distinct sub-grids placed side-by-side. The left sub-grid seems to define a structure or frame, while the right sub-grid provides content to fill parts of that structure.
4.  **Value Mapping:**
    *   The left sub-grid in the input uses a specific non-zero digit (5 in `train_1`, 1 in `train_2`) to define a frame or boundary, and the digit 0 for the areas inside this frame.
    *   The right sub-grid in the input contains various non-zero digits representing content, placed on a background of 0s.
    *   The output grid seems to be a merge operation. It retains the frame structure from the left input sub-grid. The 0s *within* the frame in the left sub-grid are replaced by the corresponding values (if non-zero) from the right sub-grid.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
task_name: overlay_content_onto_mask
description: Combine two halves of an input grid, using the left half as a mask and the right half as content to fill the mask's empty areas.

grid_properties:
  input_width_relation: twice the output width
  input_height_relation: same as output height
  cell_values: integers

components:
  - id: input_grid
    type: Grid
  - id: output_grid
    type: Grid
  - id: left_mask_grid
    type: Grid
    derivation: Left half of input_grid
    properties:
      - contains a frame defined by a non-zero value (mask_value)
      - contains empty areas defined by zero (fill_target_value: 0)
  - id: right_content_grid
    type: Grid
    derivation: Right half of input_grid
    properties:
      - contains content defined by non-zero values (content_values)
      - contains empty areas defined by zero (background_value: 0)

actions:
  - Split: Divide the input_grid vertically into left_mask_grid and right_content_grid.
  - Initialize: Create the output_grid as a copy of the left_mask_grid.
  - Iterate: Process each cell (row r, column c) of the output_grid.
  - Condition: Check if the value at output_grid[r][c] is equal to fill_target_value (0).
  - Replace: If the condition is true, update output_grid[r][c] with the value from right_content_grid[r][c].
  - Keep: If the condition is false, keep the original value in output_grid[r][c] (the mask_value).

relationships:
  - output_grid dimensions match left_mask_grid dimensions.
  - output_grid combines the structure of left_mask_grid with the content of right_content_grid based on cell values.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the dimensions of the input grid (rows `R`, columns `C`).
2.  Calculate the width of the output grid, which is `C / 2`.
3.  Divide the input grid vertically into two halves: the `left_grid` (columns 0 to `C/2 - 1`) and the `right_grid` (columns `C/2` to `C - 1`). Both halves will have dimensions `R` x `C/2`.
4.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a direct copy of the `left_grid`.
5.  Iterate through each cell of the `output_grid` using its row index `r` (from 0 to `R-1`) and column index `c` (from 0 to `C/2 - 1`).
6.  For each cell `(r, c)`, check if the value in the `output_grid` at `output_grid[r][c]` is 0.
7.  If the value is 0, replace it with the value found in the `right_grid` at the corresponding position `right_grid[r][c]`.
8.  If the value is not 0, leave it unchanged.
9.  The final `output_grid` is the result of the transformation.
