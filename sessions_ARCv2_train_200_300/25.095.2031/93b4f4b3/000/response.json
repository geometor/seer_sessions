The number of rows varies.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output is a grid of numbers with the same number of rows as the input, but exactly half the number of columns.\n3.  **Spatial Relationship:** The input grid appears to be composed of two distinct sub-grids placed side-by-side. The left sub-grid seems to define a structure or frame, while the right sub-grid provides content to fill parts of that structure.\n4.  **Value Mapping:**\n    *   The left sub-grid in the input uses a specific non-zero digit (5 in `train_1`, 1 in `train_2`) to define a frame or boundary, and the digit 0 for the areas inside this frame.\n    *   The right sub-grid in the input contains various non-zero digits representing content, placed on a background of 0s.\n    *   The output grid seems to be a merge operation. It retains the frame structure from the left input sub-grid. The 0s *within* the frame in the left sub-grid are replaced by the corresponding values (if non-zero) from the right sub-grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Initialize the `output_grid` as a direct copy of the `left_grid`.\n5.  Iterate through each cell of the `output_grid` using its row index `r` (from 0 to `R-1`) and column index `c` (from 0 to `C/2 - 1`).\n6.  For each cell `(r, c)`, check if the value in the `output_grid` at `output_grid[r][c]` is 0.\n7.  If the value is 0, replace it with the value found in the `right_grid` at the corresponding position `right_grid[r][c]`.\n8.  If the value is not 0, leave it unchanged.\n9.
