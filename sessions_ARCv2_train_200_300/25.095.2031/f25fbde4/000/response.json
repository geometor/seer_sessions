The background is represented by zeros (0).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a scaling operation applied to the shape identified in the input, followed by cropping to the bounds of the scaled shape.\n4.  **Scaling Factor:** Each cell containing a '4' in the input seems to expand into a 2x2 block of '4's in the output. This suggests a scaling factor of 2.\n5.  **Cropping/Framing:** The output grid's dimensions are not fixed but depend on the size and position of the scaled shape. The output grid tightly frames the resulting 2x scaled pattern. Zeros are used as the background filler within this frame.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
