            "text": "*   **General Assessment:** The previous analysis correctly identified the core logic: determine scan direction based on aspect ratio, find the dominant number in each row/column, and collapse consecutive identical dominant numbers. The Python code implemented this logic accurately. However, the validation errors (\"Failed to convert transformed output to integer grid\") indicate a mismatch between the output format produced by the code (a formatted string) and the format expected by the validation framework (likely a list of lists representing a grid). The content of the generated sequences matches the target outputs precisely; only the final representation needs correction.\n\n*   **Strategy:** The strategy is to modify the final step of the transformation process. Instead of formatting the collapsed sequence of dominant numbers into a string with newlines or spaces, the code should format it into a 2D list (grid) according to the scan direction:\n    *   If the scan was horizontal (`R >= C`), the output grid should be a single column (Nx1), where N is the length of the collapsed sequence.\n    *   If the scan was vertical (`C > R`), the output grid should be a single row (1xN).\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n\n    | Example   | Input Dimensions (RxC) | Scan Direction | Dominant Sequence (Pre-Collapse)            | Collapsed Sequence | Expected Output (String) | Required Output (Grid) |\n    | :-------- | :--------------------- | :------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :----------------- | :----------------------- | :--------------------- |\n    | train\\_1 | 9x7                    | Horizontal     | `[2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5]`             | `[2, 8, 5]`        | `2\\n8\\n5`                | `[[2], [8], [5]]`      |\n    | train\\_2 | 14x16                  | Vertical       | `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8]` | `[4, 2, 8]`        | `4 2 8`                  | `[[4, 2, 8]]`          |\n    | train\\_3 | 11x9                   | Horizontal     | `[6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 3, 3]`         | `[6, 4, 2, 3]`     | `6\\n4\\n2\\n3`             | `[[6], [4], [2], [3]]` |\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
