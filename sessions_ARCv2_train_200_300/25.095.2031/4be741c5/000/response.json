            "text": "*   **Perception:** The task involves processing grids of single-digit integers. The transformation rule appears to depend on the grid's aspect ratio (number of rows vs. columns). Based on this ratio, the grid is scanned either row-by-row (horizontally) or column-by-column (vertically). Within each row or column, the most frequent number (the dominant number) is identified. Consecutive rows or columns sharing the same dominant number form a \"band\". The final output is the sequence of dominant numbers corresponding to these bands, ordered as they appear (top-to-bottom for horizontal bands, left-to-right for vertical bands). The output format (newline vs. space separated) also seems correlated with the scan direction.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
