Within the input grid, the 8s form distinct connected clusters or groups. The output is also a 2D grid, significantly smaller than the input, containing 0s and 8s. The output grid's structure is consistently an identity matrix pattern where the diagonal elements are 8 and off-diagonal elements are 0. The size of the output grid correlates directly with the number of distinct connected groups of 8s found in the input grid. Connectivity between 8s seems to include diagonal adjacency (8-connectivity).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
