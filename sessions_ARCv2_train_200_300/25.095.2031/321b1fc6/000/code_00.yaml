Grid_Properties:
  - Type: 2D Array
  - Dimensions: 10x10
  - Cell_Values: Integers (0-9)
  - Background_Value: 0

Object_Types:
  - Target_Object:
      - Definition: Connected component of non-zero cells.
      - Property: All cells have the value 8.
      - Role: Is replaced during transformation.
  - Pattern_Object:
      - Definition: Connected component of non-zero cells.
      - Property: Contains cell values other than 0 or 8.
      - Role: Serves as a template for replacing Target_Objects. Original instance is removed.

Relationships_and_Actions:
  - Identification:
      - Identify all distinct connected components (objects) of non-zero cells in the input grid.
      - Categorize objects into Target_Objects and Pattern_Objects.
  - Ordering:
      - Order Pattern_Objects based on their top-most, then left-most cell coordinate.
      - Order Target_Objects based on their top-most, then left-most cell coordinate.
  - Transformation:
      - Create an empty output grid (all zeros).
      - Iterate through the ordered Target_Objects.
      - For each Target_Object, select the next Pattern_Object from the ordered list (cycling through if necessary).
      - Determine the top-left coordinate of the Target_Object's bounding box.
      - Copy the selected Pattern_Object's structure and cell values onto the output grid, aligning the pattern's top-left corner with the target's top-left coordinate.
  - Removal:
      - Original Pattern_Objects are not copied to the output grid at their original locations.

Connectivity:
  - Assume 8-way connectivity (including diagonals) for defining connected components.
