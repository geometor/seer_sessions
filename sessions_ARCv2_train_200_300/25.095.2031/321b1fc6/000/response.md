Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids (10x10) containing single digits (0-9).
2.  **Key Digit:** The digit '8' seems to play a special role in the input. Objects composed solely of '8' are targets for transformation.
3.  **Pattern Digits:** Other non-zero digits (like '6', '7', '9', '4' in the examples) form distinct shapes or "patterns" in the input.
4.  **Background:** The digit '0' represents the empty background.
5.  **Objects:** Connected components of non-zero digits form distinct objects within the grid. We can differentiate between "target objects" (made of '8') and "pattern objects" (made of other non-zero digits).
6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves replacing each "target object" ('8' shape) with one of the "pattern objects". The original "pattern objects" are removed from their initial positions.
7.  **Replacement Logic:**
    *   Multiple '8' objects and potentially multiple pattern objects can exist.
    *   The '8' objects appear to be processed in a specific order (likely top-to-bottom, then left-to-right based on their top-left corner).
    *   The available pattern objects also seem to have an order (likely top-to-bottom, then left-to-right based on their top-left corner).
    *   The replacement cycles through the available pattern objects. For instance, if there are two patterns (P1, P2) and four target objects (T1, T2, T3, T4) ordered by position, the replacements would be T1->P1, T2->P2, T3->P1, T4->P2.
8.  **Placement:** When a target object is replaced by a pattern object, the pattern object is placed such that its top-left corner aligns with the top-left corner of the bounding box of the original target object. The internal structure and digit values of the pattern object are preserved in the copy.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  - Type: 2D Array
  - Dimensions: 10x10
  - Cell_Values: Integers (0-9)
  - Background_Value: 0

Object_Types:
  - Target_Object:
      - Definition: Connected component of non-zero cells.
      - Property: All cells have the value 8.
      - Role: Is replaced during transformation.
  - Pattern_Object:
      - Definition: Connected component of non-zero cells.
      - Property: Contains cell values other than 0 or 8.
      - Role: Serves as a template for replacing Target_Objects. Original instance is removed.

Relationships_and_Actions:
  - Identification:
      - Identify all distinct connected components (objects) of non-zero cells in the input grid.
      - Categorize objects into Target_Objects and Pattern_Objects.
  - Ordering:
      - Order Pattern_Objects based on their top-most, then left-most cell coordinate.
      - Order Target_Objects based on their top-most, then left-most cell coordinate.
  - Transformation:
      - Create an empty output grid (all zeros).
      - Iterate through the ordered Target_Objects.
      - For each Target_Object, select the next Pattern_Object from the ordered list (cycling through if necessary).
      - Determine the top-left coordinate of the Target_Object's bounding box.
      - Copy the selected Pattern_Object's structure and cell values onto the output grid, aligning the pattern's top-left corner with the target's top-left coordinate.
  - Removal:
      - Original Pattern_Objects are not copied to the output grid at their original locations.

Connectivity:
  - Assume 8-way connectivity (including diagonals) for defining connected components.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros.
2.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct connected components (objects) formed by non-zero digits, using 8-way connectivity.
3.  Separate these objects into two lists: `target_objects` (those composed entirely of the digit 8) and `pattern_objects` (those containing digits other than 0 and 8).
4.  If there are no `pattern_objects`, return the empty output grid.
5.  Sort the `pattern_objects` list based on the row index of their top-most cell, breaking ties using the column index of their left-most cell.
6.  Sort the `target_objects` list using the same sorting criteria (top-most row, then left-most column).
7.  Iterate through the sorted `target_objects` list, keeping track of the index `i` (starting from 0).
8.  For each `target_object` at index `i`:
    a.  Select the `pattern_object` from the sorted list at index `j = i % number_of_pattern_objects`.
    b.  Determine the minimum row (`target_min_row`) and minimum column (`target_min_col`) coordinates occupied by the current `target_object`.
    c.  Determine the minimum row (`pattern_min_row`) and minimum column (`pattern_min_col`) coordinates occupied by the selected `pattern_object`.
    d.  For each cell `(r, c)` within the selected `pattern_object` having a value `v`:
        i.  Calculate its relative position within the pattern: `rel_row = r - pattern_min_row`, `rel_col = c - pattern_min_col`.
        ii. Calculate the corresponding position in the output grid: `output_row = target_min_row + rel_row`, `output_col = target_min_col + rel_col`.
        iii. If `output_row` and `output_col` are within the grid boundaries, set the cell `(output_row, output_col)` in the output grid to the value `v`.
9.  Return the final output grid.
