            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids (10x10) containing single digits (0-9).\n2.  **Key Digit:** The digit '8' seems to play a special role in the input. Objects composed solely of '8' are targets for transformation.\n3.  **Pattern Digits:** Other non-zero digits (like '6', '7', '9', '4' in the examples) form distinct shapes or \"patterns\" in the input.\n4.  **Background:** The digit '0' represents the empty background.\n5.  **Objects:** Connected components of non-zero digits form distinct objects within the grid. We can differentiate between \"target objects\" (made of '8') and \"pattern objects\" (made of other non-zero digits).\n6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves replacing each \"target object\" ('8' shape) with one of the \"pattern objects\". The original \"pattern objects\" are removed from their initial positions.\n7.  **Replacement Logic:**\n    *   Multiple '8' objects and potentially multiple pattern objects can exist.\n    *   The '8' objects appear to be processed in a specific order (likely top-to-bottom, then left-to-right based on their top-left corner).\n    *   The available pattern objects also seem to have an order (likely top-to-bottom, then left-to-right based on their top-left corner).\n    *   The replacement cycles through the available pattern objects. For instance, if there are two patterns (P1, P2) and four target objects (T1, T2, T3, T4) ordered by position, the replacements would be T1->P1, T2->P2, T3->P1, T4->P2.\n8.  **Placement:** When a target object is replaced by a pattern object, the pattern object is placed such that its top-left corner aligns with the top-left corner of the bounding box of the original target object. The internal structure and digit values of the pattern object are preserved in the copy.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
