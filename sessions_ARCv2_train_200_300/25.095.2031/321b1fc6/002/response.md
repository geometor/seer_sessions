**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code failed on Example 1 because the object identification logic incorrectly merged distinct pattern and target objects due to the 8-way connectivity rule applied to all non-zero cells simultaneously. Example 2 succeeded because the relevant objects were sufficiently separated.

The core issue lies in the definition and identification of objects. The connectivity analysis should be performed separately for potential target shapes (all '8's) and potential pattern shapes (other non-zero digits).

**Strategy:**

1.  **Separate Object Identification:** Modify the `_find_objects` function (or create separate functions) to first identify connected components consisting *only* of the target value (8) and then, independently, identify connected components consisting *only* of non-zero, non-target values.
2.  **Refine Data Structures:** Ensure that each identified object stores its constituent cell coordinates and values accurately, along with its calculated top-left corner.
3.  **Maintain Core Logic:** The sorting and placement logic from the original attempt seems correct in principle and should work once provided with correctly identified and separated objects.

**Metrics and Observations:**

*   **Example 1 (Failed):**
    *   Input Objects (Intended): 3 Targets (all 8s), 2 Patterns (7s, 6s).
    *   Code Identified Objects (Incorrect): 2 Targets, 1 Pattern (merged P1, P2, T3).
    *   Failure Cause: 8-way connectivity on all non-zero cells linked the '6's shape (P2) diagonally to the bottom-left '8's shape (T3), creating a single large component containing non-'8' values, thus classified as a pattern.
*   **Example 2 (Passed):**
    *   Input Objects (Intended): 3 Targets (all 8s), 1 Pattern (7,6,9,4).
    *   Code Identified Objects (Correct): 3 Targets, 1 Pattern.
    *   Success Cause: Objects were spatially separated, preventing incorrect merging by the connectivity rule.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  - Type: 2D Array
  - Dimensions: Variable (e.g., 10x10 in examples)
  - Cell_Values: Integers (0-9)
  - Background_Value: 0
  - Target_Value: 8

Object_Identification:
  - Target_Object:
      - Definition: A connected component where all cells have the value specified by `Target_Value` (8).
      - Identification: Apply connected components algorithm (e.g., `scipy.ndimage.label`) to a mask of the input grid where only cells equal to `Target_Value` are considered foreground.
      - Connectivity: 8-way (cells touching orthogonally or diagonally are connected).
  - Pattern_Object:
      - Definition: A connected component where all cells have values that are non-zero and not equal to `Target_Value`. Can contain multiple different non-target digits.
      - Identification: Apply connected components algorithm to a mask of the input grid where only cells not equal to 0 AND not equal to `Target_Value` are considered foreground.
      - Connectivity: 8-way.

Object_Properties:
  - Each object (Target or Pattern) requires:
      - `cells`: A list of tuples `(row, column, value)` for each cell belonging to the object, using values from the original input grid.
      - `top_left`: The `(minimum_row, minimum_column)` coordinate among all cells in the object. This serves as the object's reference point for sorting and placement.

Relationships_and_Actions:
  - Sorting:
      - Sort identified `Pattern_Objects` based on their `top_left` coordinates (row first, then column).
      - Sort identified `Target_Objects` based on their `top_left` coordinates (row first, then column).
  - Transformation:
      - Create an empty output grid (all zeros) of the same dimensions as the input.
      - If no `Pattern_Objects` are identified, return the empty grid.
      - Let `N` be the number of `Pattern_Objects`.
      - Iterate through the sorted `Target_Objects` using index `i` (from 0).
      - For each `Target_Object`:
          - Select the `Pattern_Object` at index `j = i % N` from the sorted list.
          - Get the `top_left` coordinate `(Tr, Tc)` of the `Target_Object`.
          - Get the `top_left` coordinate `(Pr, Pc)` of the selected `Pattern_Object`.
          - For each cell `(r, c, v)` within the selected `Pattern_Object`:
              - Calculate its relative position within the pattern: `rel_row = r - Pr`, `rel_col = c - Pc`.
              - Calculate the destination position in the output grid: `dest_row = Tr + rel_row`, `dest_col = Tc + rel_col`.
              - Check if `(dest_row, dest_col)` is within the grid boundaries.
              - If within bounds, set the output grid cell `(dest_row, dest_col)` to the value `v`.
  - Exclusion: Original `Pattern_Objects` are implicitly excluded from the output unless copied during the replacement process. Original `Target_Objects` are replaced.

Assumptions:
  - The two identification processes (for Targets and Patterns) correctly partition all relevant non-zero shapes.
  - `Target_Value` (8) is consistent across all examples for this specific task.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Define the target value as 8.
2.  Initialize an empty list for `target_objects` and an empty list for `pattern_objects`.
3.  **Identify Target Objects:**
    a.  Create a boolean mask from the input grid where `True` indicates a cell value equals the target value (8).
    b.  Find all distinct 8-way connected components in this mask.
    c.  For each component, determine the set of absolute coordinates `(row, col)` it covers. Extract the original values (all 8s) for these coordinates from the input grid. Calculate the minimum row and minimum column (`top_left`). Store the object's cells `[(row, col, value), ...]` and its `top_left` coordinate in the `target_objects` list.
4.  **Identify Pattern Objects:**
    a.  Create a boolean mask from the input grid where `True` indicates a cell value is not 0 AND not the target value (8).
    b.  Find all distinct 8-way connected components in this mask.
    c.  For each component, determine the set of absolute coordinates `(row, col)` it covers. Extract the original values for these coordinates from the input grid. Calculate the minimum row and minimum column (`top_left`). Store the object's cells `[(row, col, value), ...]` and its `top_left` coordinate in the `pattern_objects` list.
5.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros.
6.  If the `pattern_objects` list is empty, return the empty output grid.
7.  Sort the `pattern_objects` list based on their `top_left` coordinates (row first, then column).
8.  Sort the `target_objects` list based on their `top_left` coordinates (row first, then column).
9.  Let `N` be the number of objects in the sorted `pattern_objects` list.
10. Iterate through the sorted `target_objects` list using an index `i` (starting from 0).
11. For the `target_object` at index `i`:
    a.  Select the `pattern_object` from the sorted list at index `j = i % N`.
    b.  Get the `top_left` corner `(Tr, Tc)` of the current `target_object`.
    c.  Get the `top_left` corner `(Pr, Pc)` of the selected `pattern_object`.
    d.  For each cell `(r, c, v)` belonging to the selected `pattern_object`:
        i.  Calculate the cell's relative position within its pattern: `rel_row = r - Pr`, `rel_col = c - Pc`.
        ii. Calculate the destination position in the output grid: `output_row = Tr + rel_row`, `output_col = Tc + rel_col`.
        iii. If `output_row` and `output_col` are within the grid boundaries, set the cell `(output_row, output_col)` in the output grid to the value `v`.
12. Return the final output grid.
