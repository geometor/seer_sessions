            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code failed on Example 1 because the object identification logic incorrectly merged distinct pattern and target objects due to the 8-way connectivity rule applied to all non-zero cells simultaneously. Example 2 succeeded because the relevant objects were sufficiently separated.\n\nThe core issue lies in the definition and identification of objects. The connectivity analysis should be performed separately for potential target shapes (all '8's) and potential pattern shapes (other non-zero digits).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Separate Object Identification:** Modify the `_find_objects` function (or create separate functions) to first identify connected components consisting *only* of the target value (8) and then, independently, identify connected components consisting *only* of non-zero, non-target values.\n2.  **Refine Data Structures:** Ensure that each identified object stores its constituent cell coordinates and values accurately, along with its calculated top-left corner.\n3.  **Maintain Core Logic:** The sorting and placement logic from the original attempt seems correct in principle and should work once provided with correctly identified and separated objects.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\n*   **Example 1 (Failed):**\n    *   Input Objects (Intended): 3 Targets (all 8s), 2 Patterns (7s, 6s).\n    *   Code Identified Objects (Incorrect): 2 Targets, 1 Pattern (merged P1, P2, T3).\n    *   Failure Cause: 8-way connectivity on all non-zero cells linked the '6's shape (P2) diagonally to the bottom-left '8's shape (T3), creating a single large component containing non-'8' values, thus classified as a pattern.\n*   **Example 2 (Passed):**\n    *   Input Objects (Intended): 3 Targets (all 8s), 1 Pattern (7,6,9,4).\n    *   Code Identified Objects (Correct): 3 Targets, 1 Pattern.\n    *   Success Cause: Objects were spatially separated, preventing incorrect merging by the connectivity rule.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
