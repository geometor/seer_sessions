            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code (`code_00.py`) attempted to implement a single transformation rule based on the first example and preliminary observations: find 2-row high blocks, determine a target row based on median/midpoint logic, and place blocks in the target rows while maintaining their original column positions.\n\nHowever, the test results reveal this approach fails for examples 1 and 2, and potentially example 3 (though the reported failure for example 3 seems inconsistent with the code logic, suggesting a possible test execution issue or a subtle bug).\n\nComparison between inputs, expected outputs, and the code's logic reveals a key distinction based on grid height (`H`):\n1.  For `H >= 10` (Example 1), blocks are collected, sorted horizontally, and placed *adjacently* in the middle rows, starting from the minimum original column index of any block.\n2.  For `H < 10` (Examples 2 and 3), blocks are identified and placed in the target rows (determined by the median start row) while *maintaining their original column positions*.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Refine the block identification function (`find_blocks_height2`) to ensure robustness, particularly the handling of visited cells.\n2.  Implement conditional logic within the main `transform` function:\n    *   Check the grid height `H`.\n    *   If `H >= 10`, apply the \"adjacent placement\" logic: sort blocks by column, find `c_min`, calculate `r_target = H // 2`, place blocks sequentially starting at `(r_target, c_min)`.\n    *   If `H < 10`, apply the \"original position placement\" logic: calculate `r_target = median_low(start_rows)`, place each block individually at `(r_target, block['c'])`.\n3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect this conditional logic.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nMetrics are based on the revised understanding of the transformation logic required to match the *expected* outputs.\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Dimensions: H=10, W=10\n*   Blocks Found (color, r, c, w): (4, 0, 7, 3), (2, 2, 1, 3), (1, 5, 4, 3)\n*   Grid Height Condition: H=10 (>= 10) -> Adjacent Placement Rule\n*   Target Row (`r_target`): `10 // 2 = 5`\n*   Block Start Columns: [7, 1, 4]\n*   Sorted Block Order (by column): Block 2 (c=1), Block 1 (c=4), Block 4 (c=7)\n*   Minimum Start Column (`c_min`): 1\n*   Output Placement: Adjacent blocks (2, 1, 4) starting at (r=5, c=1). Output occupies rows 5 and 6, columns 1 through 9.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Dimensions: H=5, W=10\n*   Blocks Found (color, r, c, w): (2, 0, 1, 2), (1, 1, 7, 2), (4, 2, 4, 2)\n*   Grid Height Condition: H=5 (< 10) -> Original Position Placement Rule\n*   Block Start Rows: [0, 1, 2]\n*   Target Row (`r_target`): `median_low([0, 1, 2]) = 1`\n*   Output Placement: Blocks placed individually at original columns in rows 1 and 2.\n    *   Block 2 at (r=1, c=1)\n    *   Block 4 at (r=1, c=4)\n    *   Block 1 at (r=1, c=7)\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input Dimensions: H=5, W=5 (Note: Original post showed W=10, but data is 5x5) - Assuming 5x5 based on data provided. Let's recheck the input data again.\n    Input 3:\n    "
