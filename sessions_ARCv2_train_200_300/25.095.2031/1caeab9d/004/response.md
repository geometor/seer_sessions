## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code (`code_00.py`) attempted to implement a single transformation rule based on the first example and preliminary observations: find 2-row high blocks, determine a target row based on median/midpoint logic, and place blocks in the target rows while maintaining their original column positions.

However, the test results reveal this approach fails for examples 1 and 2, and potentially example 3 (though the reported failure for example 3 seems inconsistent with the code logic, suggesting a possible test execution issue or a subtle bug).

Comparison between inputs, expected outputs, and the code's logic reveals a key distinction based on grid height (`H`):
1.  For `H >= 10` (Example 1), blocks are collected, sorted horizontally, and placed *adjacently* in the middle rows, starting from the minimum original column index of any block.
2.  For `H < 10` (Examples 2 and 3), blocks are identified and placed in the target rows (determined by the median start row) while *maintaining their original column positions*.

**Strategy:**
1.  Refine the block identification function (`find_blocks_height2`) to ensure robustness, particularly the handling of visited cells.
2.  Implement conditional logic within the main `transform` function:
    *   Check the grid height `H`.
    *   If `H >= 10`, apply the "adjacent placement" logic: sort blocks by column, find `c_min`, calculate `r_target = H // 2`, place blocks sequentially starting at `(r_target, c_min)`.
    *   If `H < 10`, apply the "original position placement" logic: calculate `r_target = median_low(start_rows)`, place each block individually at `(r_target, block['c'])`.
3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect this conditional logic.

## Metrics Analysis

Metrics are based on the revised understanding of the transformation logic required to match the *expected* outputs.

**Example 1:**
*   Input Dimensions: H=10, W=10
*   Blocks Found (color, r, c, w): (4, 0, 7, 3), (2, 2, 1, 3), (1, 5, 4, 3)
*   Grid Height Condition: H=10 (>= 10) -> Adjacent Placement Rule
*   Target Row (`r_target`): `10 // 2 = 5`
*   Block Start Columns: [7, 1, 4]
*   Sorted Block Order (by column): Block 2 (c=1), Block 1 (c=4), Block 4 (c=7)
*   Minimum Start Column (`c_min`): 1
*   Output Placement: Adjacent blocks (2, 1, 4) starting at (r=5, c=1). Output occupies rows 5 and 6, columns 1 through 9.

**Example 2:**
*   Input Dimensions: H=5, W=10
*   Blocks Found (color, r, c, w): (2, 0, 1, 2), (1, 1, 7, 2), (4, 2, 4, 2)
*   Grid Height Condition: H=5 (< 10) -> Original Position Placement Rule
*   Block Start Rows: [0, 1, 2]
*   Target Row (`r_target`): `median_low([0, 1, 2]) = 1`
*   Output Placement: Blocks placed individually at original columns in rows 1 and 2.
    *   Block 2 at (r=1, c=1)
    *   Block 4 at (r=1, c=4)
    *   Block 1 at (r=1, c=7)

**Example 3:**
*   Input Dimensions: H=5, W=5 (Note: Original post showed W=10, but data is 5x5) - Assuming 5x5 based on data provided. Let's recheck the input data again.
    Input 3:
    
```
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- W=10
    0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 1 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0
    ```

    Okay, Width is 10.
*   Input Dimensions: H=5, W=10
*   Blocks Found (color, r, c, w): (2, 1, 3, 1), (1, 2, 1, 1), (4, 3, 6, 1)
*   Grid Height Condition: H=5 (< 10) -> Original Position Placement Rule
*   Block Start Rows: [1, 2, 3]
*   Target Row (`r_target`): `median_low([1, 2, 3]) = 2`
*   Output Placement: Blocks placed individually at original columns in rows 2 and 3.
    *   Block 1 at (r=2, c=1)
    *   Block 2 at (r=2, c=3)
    *   Block 4 at (r=2, c=6)

This analysis confirms the two distinct placement rules based on grid height.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create an empty output grid with the same dimensions (height `H`, width `W`) as the input grid, filled with the background color '0'.
2.  **Identify Blocks:** Scan the input grid to find all separate, contiguous rectangular blocks that have a height of exactly 2 rows and consist of the same non-zero digit. For each block found, record its color, its top row index (`r`), its leftmost column index (`c`), and its width (`w`).
3.  **Check for Blocks:** If no such blocks are found, return the initialized empty output grid.
4.  **Check Grid Height:** Determine the height `H` of the input grid.
5.  **Conditional Placement Logic:**
    *   **If Grid Height `H` is 10 or greater:**
        a.  **Determine Target Row:** Calculate the target top row index `r_target = H // 2` (integer division).
        b.  **Determine Horizontal Order and Start:** Sort the identified blocks based on their leftmost column index (`c`) in ascending order. Find the minimum column index (`c_min`) among all the identified blocks.
        c.  **Place Blocks Adjacently:** Initialize a `current_col` variable to `c_min`. Iterate through the sorted blocks. For each block, copy its color into the output grid in rows `r_target` and `r_target + 1`, spanning columns from `current_col` to `current_col + block_width - 1`. Update `current_col` by adding the width of the block just placed.
    *   **If Grid Height `H` is less than 10:**
        a.  **Determine Target Row:** Collect the top row indices (`r`) of all identified blocks into a list. Calculate the target top row index `r_target` by finding the lower median (`median_low`) of this list of starting rows.
        b.  **Place Blocks at Original Columns:** Iterate through all identified blocks (order does not matter here). For each block, copy its color into the output grid in rows `r_target` and `r_target + 1`, spanning columns from the block's original leftmost column (`c`) to `c + block_width - 1`.
6.  **Return Output:** Return the modified output grid.
