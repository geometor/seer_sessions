## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids of single digits. The digit '0' represents the background. Non-zero digits represent distinct 'colors'.
2.  **Core Objects:** The key elements are contiguous rectangular blocks of identical non-zero digits ("color blocks"). In all examples, these blocks have a height of 2 rows. Their widths vary.
3.  **Transformation:** The task involves identifying these color blocks in the input, removing them from their original positions, and placing them adjacent to each other horizontally in a specific location in the output grid.
4.  **Horizontal Arrangement:** The blocks in the output are arranged horizontally without gaps. Their relative order corresponds to their left-to-right order in the input grid (based on the minimum column index of each block).
5.  **Horizontal Placement:** The combined horizontal strip of blocks in the output starts at the column corresponding to the minimum column index occupied by any non-zero cell in the input grid.
6.  **Vertical Placement:** The blocks are placed in two adjacent rows in the output grid. The determination of these two rows appears to depend on the input grid's height (`H`) and the vertical positions of the input blocks.
    *   Find the starting row index (top row) for each distinct color block in the input.
    *   If the grid height `H` is 10 or greater, the target top row (`r_target`) for the output strip seems to be `floor(H/2)`.
    *   If the grid height `H` is less than 10, find the median of the starting row indices of all blocks. The block corresponding to this median starting row index determines the target top row (`r_target`) for the output strip; `r_target` is the starting row index of this median block.
    *   The output strip occupies rows `r_target` and `r_target + 1`.
7.  **Output Grid:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. All locations not occupied by the rearranged blocks are filled with '0'.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color '0'.
2.  **Identify Blocks:** Scan the input grid to find all separate, contiguous rectangular blocks of identical non-zero digits. For each block, record its color (digit), its top row index (`r`), its leftmost column index (`c`), and its width (`w`). (Note: observed height `h` is always 2).
3.  **Determine Horizontal Order and Start:** Find the minimum column index (`c_min`) among all identified blocks. Sort the identified blocks based on their leftmost column index (`c`) in ascending order.
4.  **Determine Vertical Position:**
    a.  Let `H` be the height of the input grid.
    b.  Get the list of top

"""
Identifies contiguous rectangular blocks of height 2 with the same non-zero color in the input grid.
Determines the horizontal placement (minimum column index of any block) and vertical placement (based on grid height and median starting row of blocks) for the output.
Rearranges the identified blocks horizontally adjacent to each other in the output grid at the determined location, sorted by their original horizontal position (leftmost column).
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, with all other cells set to 0.

Detailed Vertical Placement Logic:
1. Find the starting row index (top row) for each distinct color block (height 2) in the input.
2. Let H be the grid height.
3. If H >= 10, the target top row (r_target) for the output strip is floor(H/2).
4. If H < 10:
    a. Get the list of starting row indices of all blocks.
    b. Find the median value of these starting row indices. Use median_low (the lower of the two middle values if the count is even) to ensure the median corresponds to an actual starting row.
    c. The target top row (r_target) is this median starting row value.
5. The output strip occupies rows r_target and r_target + 1.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code (`code_00.py`) attempted to implement a single transformation rule based on the first example and preliminary observations: find 2-row high blocks, determine a target row based on median/midpoint logic, and place blocks in the target rows while maintaining their original column positions.

However, the test results reveal this approach fails for examples 1 and 2, and potentially example 3 (though the reported failure for example 3 seems inconsistent with the code logic, suggesting a possible test execution issue or a subtle bug).

Comparison between inputs, expected outputs, and the code's logic reveals a key distinction based on grid height (`H`):
1.  For `H >= 10` (Example 1), blocks are collected, sorted horizontally, and placed *adjacently* in the middle rows, starting from the minimum original column index of any block.
2.  For `H < 10` (Examples 2 and 3), blocks are identified and placed in the target rows (determined by the median start row) while *maintaining their original column positions*.

**Strategy:**
1.  Refine the block identification function (`find_blocks_height2`) to ensure robustness, particularly the handling of visited cells.
2.  Implement conditional logic within the main `transform` function:
    *   Check the grid height `H`.
    *   If `H >= 10`, apply the "adjacent placement" logic: sort blocks by column, find `c_min`, calculate `r_target = H // 2`, place blocks sequentially starting at `(r_target, c_min)`.
    *   If `H < 10`, apply the "original position placement" logic: calculate `r_target = median_low(start_rows)`, place each block individually at `(r_target, block['c'])`.
3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect this conditional logic.

## Metrics Analysis

Metrics are based on the revised understanding of the transformation logic required to match the *expected* outputs.

**Example 1:**
*   Input Dimensions: H=10, W=10
*   Blocks Found (color, r, c, w): (4, 0, 7, 3), (2, 2, 1, 3), (1, 5, 4, 3)
*   Grid Height Condition: H=10 (>= 10) -> Adjacent Placement Rule
*   Target Row (`r_target`): `10 // 2 = 5`
*   Block Start Columns: [7, 1, 4]
*   Sorted Block Order (by column): Block 2 (c=1), Block 1 (c=4), Block 4 (c=7)
*   Minimum Start Column (`c_min`): 1
*   Output Placement: Adjacent blocks (2, 1, 4) starting at (r=5, c=1). Output occupies rows 5 and 6, columns 1 through 9.

**Example 2:**
*   Input Dimensions: H=5, W=10
*   Blocks Found (color, r, c, w): (2, 0, 1, 2), (1, 1, 7, 2), (4, 2, 4, 2)
*   Grid Height Condition: H=5 (< 10) -> Original Position Placement Rule
*   Block Start Rows: [0, 1, 2]
*   Target Row (`r_target`): `median_low([0, 1, 2]) = 1`
*   Output Placement: Blocks placed individually at original columns in rows 1 and 2.
    *   Block 2 at (r=1, c=1)
    *   Block 4 at (r=1, c=4)
    *   Block 1 at (r=1, c=7)

**Example 3:**
*   Input Dimensions: H=5, W=5 (Note: Original post showed W=10, but data is 5x5) - Assuming 5x5 based on data provided. Let's recheck the input data again.
    Input 3:
    
```
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- W=10
    0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 1 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0
    ```

    Okay, Width is 10.
*   Input Dimensions: H=5, W=10
*   Blocks Found (color, r, c, w): (2, 1, 3, 1), (1, 2, 1, 1), (4, 3, 6, 1)
*   Grid Height Condition: H=5 (< 10) -> Original Position Placement Rule
*   Block Start Rows: [1, 2, 3]
*   Target Row (`r_target`): `median_low([1, 2, 3]) = 2`
*   Output Placement: Blocks placed individually at original columns in rows 2 and 3.
    *   Block 1 at (r=2, c=1)
    *   Block 2 at (r=2, c=3)
    *   Block 4 at (r=2, c=6)

This analysis confirms the two distinct placement rules based on grid height.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create an empty output grid with the same dimensions (height `H`, width `W`) as the input grid, filled with the background color '0'.
2.  **Identify Blocks:** Scan the input grid to find all separate, contiguous rectangular blocks that have a height of exactly 2 rows and consist of the same non-zero digit. For each block found, record its color, its top row index (`r`), its leftmost column index (`c`), and its width (`w`).
3.  **Check for Blocks:** If no such blocks are found, return the initialized empty output grid.
4.  **Check Grid Height:** Determine the height `H` of the input grid.
5.  **Conditional Placement Logic:**
    *   **If Grid Height `H` is 10 or greater:**
        a.  **Determine Target Row:** Calculate the target top row index `r_target = H // 2` (integer division).
        b.  **Determine Horizontal Order and Start:** Sort the identified blocks based on their leftmost column index (`c`) in ascending order. Find the minimum column index (`c_min`) among all the identified blocks.
        c.  **Place Blocks Adjacently:** Initialize a `current_col` variable to `c_min`. Iterate through the sorted blocks. For each block, copy its color into the output grid in rows `r_target` and `r_target + 1`, spanning columns from `current_col` to `current_col + block_width - 1`. Update `current_col` by adding the width of the block just placed.
    *   **If Grid Height `H` is less than 10:**
        a.  **Determine Target Row:** Collect the top row indices (`r`) of all identified blocks into a list. Calculate the target top row index `r_target` by finding the lower median (`median_low`) of this list of starting rows.
        b.  **Place Blocks at Original Columns:** Iterate through all identified blocks (order does not matter here). For each block, copy its color into the output grid in rows `r_target` and `r_target + 1`, spanning columns from the block's original leftmost column (`c`) to `c + block_width - 1`.
6.  **Return Output:** Return the modified output grid.
