"""
Identifies contiguous rectangular blocks of height 2 with the same non-zero color in the input grid.
Determines the horizontal placement (minimum column index of any block) and vertical placement (based on grid height and median starting row of blocks) for the output.
Rearranges the identified blocks horizontally adjacent to each other in the output grid at the determined location, sorted by their original horizontal position (leftmost column).
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, with all other cells set to 0.

Detailed Vertical Placement Logic:
1. Find the starting row index (top row) for each distinct color block (height 2) in the input.
2. Let H be the grid height.
3. If H >= 10, the target top row (r_target) for the output strip is floor(H/2).
4. If H < 10:
    a. Get the list of starting row indices of all blocks.
    b. Find the median value of these starting row indices. Use median_low (the lower of the two middle values if the count is even) to ensure the median corresponds to an actual starting row.
    c. The target top row (r_target) is this median starting row value.
5. The output strip occupies rows r_target and r_target + 1.
