task_type: grid_transformation
input_features:
  grid_dimensions: [height, width]
  cell_values: digits 0-9
  background_value: 0
  objects:
    - type: contiguous_block
      properties:
        color: non-zero digit (constant within block)
        shape: rectangular
        height: 2 (constant observed value)
        position: [top_row, left_col] # r, c
        width: variable # w
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    between: blocks
    attributes: [relative_position_horizontal, relative_position_vertical] # In the input
output_features:
  grid_dimensions: same as input
  cell_values: digits 0-9
  background_value: 0
  objects:
    - type: collection_of_blocks # No longer a single composite block
      properties:
        constituent_blocks: input blocks identified
        arrangement: Placed individually, preserving original horizontal position
        target_top_row: Determined by specific rule (see actions)
        position_of_each_block: [target_top_row, original_left_col]
        height: 2 (constant)
actions:
  - identify_blocks: Find all distinct contiguous non-zero blocks in the input with height=2. Record color, top_row (r), left_col (c), width (w) for each.
  - store_block_properties: Keep a list of identified blocks with their properties (color, r, c, w).
  - determine_target_row:
      input: grid_height (H), list of block starting rows (all_r)
      condition: H >= 10
      action: target_top_row = floor(H / 2)
      condition: H < 10
      action:
        - calculate median_low of all_r
        - target_top_row = calculated median_low value
  - create_output_grid: Initialize grid of same dimensions as input with background value (0).
  - place_blocks_individually:
      iterate: through each identified block in the stored list
      action:
        - get block's color, original left_col (c), width (w)
        - copy the block's color values into the output grid
        - target_location: rows target_top_row and target_top_row + 1
        - target_columns: from original_left_col to original_left_col + width - 1
