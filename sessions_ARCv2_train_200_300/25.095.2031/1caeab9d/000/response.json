            "text": "## Perception of Task Elements\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids of single digits. The digit '0' represents the background. Non-zero digits represent distinct 'colors'.\n2.  **Core Objects:** The key elements are contiguous rectangular blocks of identical non-zero digits (\"color blocks\"). In all examples, these blocks have a height of 2 rows. Their widths vary.\n3.  **Transformation:** The task involves identifying these color blocks in the input, removing them from their original positions, and placing them adjacent to each other horizontally in a specific location in the output grid.\n4.  **Horizontal Arrangement:** The blocks in the output are arranged horizontally without gaps. Their relative order corresponds to their left-to-right order in the input grid (based on the minimum column index of each block).\n5.  **Horizontal Placement:** The combined horizontal strip of blocks in the output starts at the column corresponding to the minimum column index occupied by any non-zero cell in the input grid.\n6.  **Vertical Placement:** The blocks are placed in two adjacent rows in the output grid. The determination of these two rows appears to depend on the input grid's height (`H`) and the vertical positions of the input blocks.\n    *   Find the starting row index (top row) for each distinct color block in the input.\n    *   If the grid height `H` is 10 or greater, the target top row (`r_target`) for the output strip seems to be `floor(H/2)`.\n    *   If the grid height `H` is less than 10, find the median of the starting row indices of all blocks. The block corresponding to this median starting row index determines the target top row (`r_target`) for the output strip; `r_target` is the starting row index of this median block.\n    *   The output strip occupies rows `r_target` and `r_target + 1`.\n7.  **Output Grid:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. All locations not occupied by the rearranged blocks are filled with '0'.\n\n## Documented Facts\n\n"
