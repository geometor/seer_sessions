## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids of single digits. The digit '0' represents the background. Non-zero digits represent distinct 'colors'.
2.  **Core Objects:** The key elements are contiguous rectangular blocks of identical non-zero digits ("color blocks"). In all examples, these blocks have a height of 2 rows. Their widths vary.
3.  **Transformation:** The task involves identifying these color blocks in the input, removing them from their original positions, and placing them adjacent to each other horizontally in a specific location in the output grid.
4.  **Horizontal Arrangement:** The blocks in the output are arranged horizontally without gaps. Their relative order corresponds to their left-to-right order in the input grid (based on the minimum column index of each block).
5.  **Horizontal Placement:** The combined horizontal strip of blocks in the output starts at the column corresponding to the minimum column index occupied by any non-zero cell in the input grid.
6.  **Vertical Placement:** The blocks are placed in two adjacent rows in the output grid. The determination of these two rows appears to depend on the input grid's height (`H`) and the vertical positions of the input blocks.
    *   Find the starting row index (top row) for each distinct color block in the input.
    *   If the grid height `H` is 10 or greater, the target top row (`r_target`) for the output strip seems to be `floor(H/2)`.
    *   If the grid height `H` is less than 10, find the median of the starting row indices of all blocks. The block corresponding to this median starting row index determines the target top row (`r_target`) for the output strip; `r_target` is the starting row index of this median block.
    *   The output strip occupies rows `r_target` and `r_target + 1`.
7.  **Output Grid:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. All locations not occupied by the rearranged blocks are filled with '0'.

  - determine_target_row:
      condition: grid_height >= 10
      action: target_top_row = floor(grid_height / 2)
      condition: grid_height < 10
      action:
        - find median starting row among all blocks
        - identify block corresponding to median starting row
        - target_top_row = starting row of the median block
  - determine_target_col: target_left_col = minimum left_col among all input blocks.
  - sort_blocks: order input blocks based on their left_col (ascending).
  - create_output_grid: initialize grid of same dimensions as input with background value.
  - place_blocks: copy sorted blocks sequentially into the output grid at the target row/column, updating the horizontal placement position after each block.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color '0'.
2.  **Identify Blocks:** Scan the input grid to find all separate, contiguous rectangular blocks of identical non-zero digits. For each block, record its color (digit), its top row index (`r`), its leftmost column index (`c`), and its width (`w`). (Note: observed height `h` is always 2).
3.  **Determine Horizontal Order and Start:** Find the minimum column index (`c_min`) among all identified blocks. Sort the identified blocks based on their leftmost column index (`c`) in ascending order.
4.  **Determine Vertical Position:**
    a.  Let `H` be the height of the input grid.
    b.  Get the list of top
