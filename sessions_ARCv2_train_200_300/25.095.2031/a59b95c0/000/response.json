It appears to be determined by a specific value within the input grid itself.\n6.  **Key Location:** By analyzing the relationship between input values and the output size (tiling factor), the value at the bottom-right corner of the input grid (`Input[2][2]`) consistently predicts the tiling factor across all examples.\n7.  **Mapping Rule:** There's a specific mapping between the value at `Input[2][2]` and the tiling factor (`k`). Based on the examples: 1->3, 2->2, 3->4, 4->2, 6->3.\n8.  **Output Construction:** Once the tiling factor `k` is determined, the output grid is constructed by creating a `k x k` arrangement of the original input grid.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"

Determine the integer tiling factor `k` based on the value `v` according to the following rules:\n    *   If `v` is 1, set `k` to 3.\n    *   If `v` is 2, set `k` to 2.\n    *   If `v` is 3, set `k` to 4.\n    *   If `v` is 4, set `k` to 2.\n    *   If `v` is 6, set `k` to 3.\n    *   (For any other value `v`, the rule is undefined by the examples, but assume a defined mapping exists).\n4.  Create a new output grid whose dimensions are `k` times the dimensions of the input grid (e.g., if input is 3x3 and k=2, output is 6x6).\n5.  Fill the output grid by tiling the input grid `k` times horizontally and `k` times vertically, effectively creating a `k x k` block arrangement of the original input grid."
