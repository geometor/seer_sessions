## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input Data:** The input consists of square grids of numbers (specifically 3x3 grids in all examples).
2.  **Output Data:** The output also consists of square grids of numbers, larger than the input grids.
3.  **Transformation:** The output grid is formed by repeating or "tiling" the input grid multiple times horizontally and vertically.
4.  **Core Operation:** The fundamental operation is spatial replication of the input pattern.
5.  **Determining Factor:** The number of times the input grid is replicated (the tiling factor) is not constant. It appears to be determined by a specific value within the input grid itself.
6.  **Key Location:** By analyzing the relationship between input values and the output size (tiling factor), the value at the bottom-right corner of the input grid (`Input[2][2]`) consistently predicts the tiling factor across all examples.
7.  **Mapping Rule:** There's a specific mapping between the value at `Input[2][2]` and the tiling factor (`k`). Based on the examples: 1->3, 2->2, 3->4, 4->2, 6->3.
8.  **Output Construction:** Once the tiling factor `k` is determined, the output grid is constructed by creating a `k x k` arrangement of the original input grid.

        output_dimensions: (k * input_rows, k * input_cols)

  - input grid content defines the pattern to be tiled.
  - a specific element (bottom-right) in the input grid determines the scale of tiling (factor 'k').
  - output grid is composed entirely of repetitions of the input grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Read the input grid.
2.  Extract the integer value `v` located at the bottom-right corner of the input grid.
3.  Determine the integer tiling factor `k` based on the value `v` according to the following rules:
    *   If `v` is 1, set `k` to 3.
    *   If `v` is 2, set `k` to 2.
    *   If `v` is 3, set `k` to 4.
    *   If `v` is 4, set `k` to 2.
    *   If `v` is 6, set `k` to 3.
    *   (For any other value `v`, the rule is undefined by the examples, but assume a defined mapping exists).
4.  Create a new output grid whose dimensions are `k` times the dimensions of the input grid (e.g., if input is 3x3 and k=2, output is 6x6).
5.  Fill the output grid by tiling the input grid `k` times horizontally and `k` times vertically, effectively creating a `k x k` block arrangement of the original input grid.
