task_elements:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array of integers
    role: input and output container
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row_index, column_index)
  - object: target_digit
    value: 5
    description: The specific digit in the input grid that undergoes replacement.
  - object: replacement_source
    location: Column 0 of each row in the input grid.
    description: The value in this column determines the replacement for the target_digit in the same row.
relationships:
  - type: governs
    subject: cell at (row, 0) in input grid
    object: all cells with value 5 in the same row 'row'
    description: The value of the cell at column 0 dictates the output value for cells containing '5' in that row.
actions:
  - name: replace
    actor: transformation process
    target: each cell in the input grid with value 5
    effect: change the cell's value in the output grid to the value found in column 0 of its corresponding row in the input grid.
  - name: copy
    actor: transformation process
    target: each cell in the input grid with value != 5
    effect: maintain the cell's original value in the output grid.
