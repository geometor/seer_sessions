            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Data Structure:** The input and output are both 2D grids (matrices) of integers. The grid dimensions appear consistent between input and output within each example (10x10).\n2.  **Key Values:** The grids contain the digit '0' (representing a background or empty state) and other non-zero digits. The digit '5' seems to play a special role in the input, as it is present in the input grids but absent in the output grids.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation involves replacing occurrences of the digit '5' in the input grid. The replacement value is determined by another digit within the *same row*. Specifically, the digit in the first column (column index 0) of that row seems to dictate the replacement value for any '5's found in that row.\n4.  **Row-Based Logic:** The transformation appears to operate independently on each row. The value used for replacement is constant for all '5's within a single row.\n5.  **Identity:** Digits other than '5' in the input seem to retain their original value and position in the output grid. The '0's also remain unchanged.\n\n**Fact Document:**\n\n"

Iterate through each row of the input grid, identified by its row index `r`.\n3.  For the current row `r`, determine the replacement value by reading the digit located at column index 0 (i.e., `input_grid[r][0]`). Store this as `replacement_value`.\n4.  Iterate through each column of the current row `r`, identified by its column index `c`.\n5.  Examine the value of the cell at `input_grid[r][c]`.\n6.  If the value of `input_grid[r][c]` is 5, set the corresponding cell in the output grid, `output_grid[r][c]`, to the `replacement_value` determined in step 3.\n7.  If the value of `input_grid[r][c]` is *not* 5, copy the value directly from the input to the output: set `output_grid[r][c]` to `input_grid[r][c]`.\n8.  After iterating through all rows and columns, the output grid contains the transformed result."
