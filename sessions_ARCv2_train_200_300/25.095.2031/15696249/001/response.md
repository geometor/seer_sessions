"""
Transforms a 3x3 input grid into a 9x9 output grid by tiling the input grid
either horizontally or vertically within the output grid. The placement and
orientation depend on the value `N` in the top-left cell (0,0) of the input grid.

1. Initialize a 9x9 output grid with zeros.
2. Extract the control value `N` from `input_grid[0][0]`.
3. Calculate block indices: `block_row = (N - 1) // 3` and
   `block_col = (N - 1) % 3`. These indices conceptually divide the 9x9
   output grid into a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks.
4. Determine tiling direction:
   - If `block_col == 0`, tile horizontally across the `block_row`-th row of
     blocks.
   - If `block_col != 0`, tile vertically down the `block_row`-th column of
     blocks. (Note: The start column index is determined by `block_row`).
5. Copy the 3x3 input grid three times into the appropriate location in the
   output grid according to the determined tiling direction and block indices.
