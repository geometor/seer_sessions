            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception of Task Elements\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids (or lists of lists) containing integer values.\n2.  **Grid Dimensions:** The dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the output grid are identical to the input grid in all examples.\n3.  **Cell Values:** The grids primarily contain the integers 0, 3, and 8.\n4.  **Transformation Nature:** The transformation appears to operate independently on each row of the grid. Comparing input and output rows reveals that the positions of the number `3` change, while `0`s and `8`s generally remain fixed, although `0`s can be replaced by `3`s, and original `3`s can become `0`s.\n5.  **Movement Pattern:** The number `3` seems to move horizontally to the left within its row. Contiguous blocks of `3`s move together as a single unit.\n6.  **Movement Constraints:**\n    *   The movement stops when the block of `3`(s) reaches the beginning of the row (column 0).\n    *   The movement also stops if the cell immediately to the left of the block's leftmost `3` contains a non-zero value (specifically `8` in the examples). The `3`s settle just to the right of this \"barrier\".\n7.  **Value Updates:** When a block of `3`s moves from its original position to a new position, the cells at the original location are replaced with `0`s, and the cells at the new destination (which must have been `0`s) are replaced with `3`s.\n\n## YAML Fact Documentation\n\n"

For each `row`, create a mutable copy (e.g., a list) called `output_row` initialized with the values from the input `row`.\n3.  Scan the `input_row` from right-to-left using a column index `j`, starting from the last column (`width - 1`) down to the first column (`0`).\n4.  If the cell at `input_row[j]` contains the value `3`:\n    a.  Identify the start column `start_col` of the contiguous block of `3`s that ends at column `j`. This is the smallest index `k <= j` such that all cells from `input_row[k]` to `input_row[j]` are `3`.\n    b.  Calculate the length of this block: `block_length = j - start_col + 1`.\n    c.  Determine the target destination column `dest_col` for the start of the block. Scan leftwards from `start_col - 1` down to `0`. `dest_col` is the column index `k + 1` if `input_row[k]` contains a non-zero value (like `8`). If no non-zero value is encountered before reaching the start of the row, `dest_col` is `0`.\n    d.  Check if the block needs to move (`dest_col != start_col`).\n    e.  If the block needs to move:\n        i.  Update the `output_row`: Set the values from `start_col` to `j` (the original block location) to `0`.\n        ii. Update the `output_row`: Set the values from `dest_col` to `dest_col + block_length - 1` (the new block location) to `3`.\n    f.  Update the scanning index `j` to `start_col - 1` to skip over the block just processed and avoid reprocessing its parts.\n5.  After processing the entire row, replace the original row in the grid structure with the modified `output_row`.\n6.  Return the modified grid."
