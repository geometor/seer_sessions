Task: Grid Transformation

Elements:
  - Grid: A 2D array of integers.
  - Row: A 1D array (list) of integers, representing a single row within the Grid.
  - Cell: An individual element within a Row, containing an integer value.
  - Number: Integer values within Cells.
    - Value_0: Represents empty space. Can be overwritten by Value_3 during movement.
    - Value_3: Represents movable objects/blocks. These initiate the transformation.
    - Value_8: Represents fixed barriers. Blocks the movement of Value_3.

Properties:
  - Grid:
    - has dimensions (rows, columns).
    - composed of Rows.
  - Row:
    - has length (number of columns).
    - contains Cells ordered by column index.
  - Cell:
    - has a value (0, 3, or 8).
    - has a position (row_index, column_index).

Actions:
  - Process_Grid: Apply transformation to each Row independently.
  - Process_Row:
    - Identify_Blocks: Find all contiguous sequences of Value_3 within the Row.
    - Determine_Destination: For each block of Value_3 (processed right-to-left), find the leftmost possible position it can move to without crossing a Value_8 or the left grid boundary.
    - Move_Block:
      - Clear_Original: Set the original cells of the moved block to Value_0.
      - Place_New: Set the destination cells to Value_3.

Relationships:
  - Movement: Horizontal, leftward only, within a single Row.
  - Blocking: Value_8 prevents further leftward movement of Value_3 blocks. The left edge (column 0) also acts as a boundary.
  - Overwriting: Moving Value_3 blocks overwrite Value_0 cells at the destination and leave Value_0 cells at the origin.
