Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids (or lists of lists) containing integer values.
2.  **Grid Dimensions:** The dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the output grid are identical to the input grid in all examples.
3.  **Cell Values:** The grids primarily contain the integers 0, 3, and 8.
4.  **Transformation Nature:** The transformation appears to operate independently on each row of the grid. Comparing input and output rows reveals that the positions of the number `3` change, while `0`s and `8`s generally remain fixed, although `0`s can be replaced by `3`s, and original `3`s can become `0`s.
5.  **Movement Pattern:** The number `3` seems to move horizontally to the left within its row. Contiguous blocks of `3`s move together as a single unit.
6.  **Movement Constraints:**
    *   The movement stops when the block of `3`(s) reaches the beginning of the row (column 0).
    *   The movement also stops if the cell immediately to the left of the block's leftmost `3` contains a non-zero value (specifically `8` in the examples). The `3`s settle just to the right of this "barrier".
7.  **Value Updates:** When a block of `3`s moves from its original position to a new position, the cells at the original location are replaced with `0`s, and the cells at the new destination (which must have been `0`s) are replaced with `3`s.

## YAML Fact Documentation


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation

Elements:
  - Grid: A 2D array of integers.
  - Row: A 1D array (list) of integers, representing a single row within the Grid.
  - Cell: An individual element within a Row, containing an integer value.
  - Number: Integer values within Cells.
    - Value_0: Represents empty space. Can be overwritten by Value_3 during movement.
    - Value_3: Represents movable objects/blocks. These initiate the transformation.
    - Value_8: Represents fixed barriers. Blocks the movement of Value_3.

Properties:
  - Grid:
    - has dimensions (rows, columns).
    - composed of Rows.
  - Row:
    - has length (number of columns).
    - contains Cells ordered by column index.
  - Cell:
    - has a value (0, 3, or 8).
    - has a position (row_index, column_index).

Actions:
  - Process_Grid: Apply transformation to each Row independently.
  - Process_Row:
    - Identify_Blocks: Find all contiguous sequences of Value_3 within the Row.
    - Determine_Destination: For each block of Value_3 (processed right-to-left), find the leftmost possible position it can move to without crossing a Value_8 or the left grid boundary.
    - Move_Block:
      - Clear_Original: Set the original cells of the moved block to Value_0.
      - Place_New: Set the destination cells to Value_3.

Relationships:
  - Movement: Horizontal, leftward only, within a single Row.
  - Blocking: Value_8 prevents further leftward movement of Value_3 blocks. The left edge (column 0) also acts as a boundary.
  - Overwriting: Moving Value_3 blocks overwrite Value_0 cells at the destination and leave Value_0 cells at the origin.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Iterate through each `row` in the input `grid`.
2.  For each `row`, create a mutable copy (e.g., a list) called `output_row` initialized with the values from the input `row`.
3.  Scan the `input_row` from right-to-left using a column index `j`, starting from the last column (`width - 1`) down to the first column (`0`).
4.  If the cell at `input_row[j]` contains the value `3`:
    a.  Identify the start column `start_col` of the contiguous block of `3`s that ends at column `j`. This is the smallest index `k <= j` such that all cells from `input_row[k]` to `input_row[j]` are `3`.
    b.  Calculate the length of this block: `block_length = j - start_col + 1`.
    c.  Determine the target destination column `dest_col` for the start of the block. Scan leftwards from `start_col - 1` down to `0`. `dest_col` is the column index `k + 1` if `input_row[k]` contains a non-zero value (like `8`). If no non-zero value is encountered before reaching the start of the row, `dest_col` is `0`.
    d.  Check if the block needs to move (`dest_col != start_col`).
    e.  If the block needs to move:
        i.  Update the `output_row`: Set the values from `start_col` to `j` (the original block location) to `0`.
        ii. Update the `output_row`: Set the values from `dest_col` to `dest_col + block_length - 1` (the new block location) to `3`.
    f.  Update the scanning index `j` to `start_col - 1` to skip over the block just processed and avoid reprocessing its parts.
5.  After processing the entire row, replace the original row in the grid structure with the modified `output_row`.
6.  Return the modified grid.
