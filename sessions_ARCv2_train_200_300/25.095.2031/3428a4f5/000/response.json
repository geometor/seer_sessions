The values observed are 0, 2, and 4.\n2.  **Separator:** A distinct feature within each input grid is a single row composed entirely of the value 4. This row acts as a horizontal separator.\n3.  **Sub-Grids:** The separator divides the input grid into two distinct sub-grids of equal dimensions: one above the separator (Top Sub-grid) and one below it (Bottom Sub-grid).\n4.  **Output Data:** The output is also a grid of integers, but the values are only 0 and 3.\n5.  **Dimensionality:** The output grid's dimensions (rows and columns) are identical to the dimensions of the Top and Bottom Sub-grids derived from the input.\n6.  **Transformation:** The core operation appears to be a comparison between the corresponding cells of the Top and Bottom Sub-grids. The result of this comparison determines the value of the corresponding cell in the output grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
