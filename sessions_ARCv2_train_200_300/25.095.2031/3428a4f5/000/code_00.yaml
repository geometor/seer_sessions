Objects:
  - InputGrid:
      description: The primary input, a 2D array of integers.
      properties:
        - values: [0, 2, 4]
        - contains_separator: true
  - OutputGrid:
      description: The resulting 2D array of integers.
      properties:
        - values: [0, 3]
        - dimensions: Matches the dimensions of the input sub-grids.
  - SeparatorRow:
      description: A row within the InputGrid consisting solely of the value 4.
      properties:
        - value: 4
        - function: Divides InputGrid into Top and Bottom Sub-grids.
  - TopSubGrid:
      description: The portion of the InputGrid above the SeparatorRow.
      properties:
        - dimensions: Same as OutputGrid.
  - BottomSubGrid:
      description: The portion of the InputGrid below the SeparatorRow.
      properties:
        - dimensions: Same as OutputGrid.
  - Cell:
      description: An individual element within a grid.
      properties:
        - row_index
        - column_index
        - value

Actions:
  - Split: Dividing the InputGrid into TopSubGrid and BottomSubGrid using the SeparatorRow.
  - Compare: Element-wise comparison between cells at the same position (row, column) in TopSubGrid and BottomSubGrid.
  - Assign: Setting the value of a cell in the OutputGrid based on the comparison result.

Relationships:
  - OutputGrid dimensions == TopSubGrid dimensions == BottomSubGrid dimensions.
  - OutputGrid[r, c] depends on TopSubGrid[r, c] and BottomSubGrid[r, c].
  - The comparison rule: OutputGrid[r, c] is 0 if TopSubGrid[r, c] == BottomSubGrid[r, c], otherwise it is 3.
