Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and describe the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Data:** The input is structured as a grid (matrix) of integers. The values observed are 0, 2, and 4.
2.  **Separator:** A distinct feature within each input grid is a single row composed entirely of the value 4. This row acts as a horizontal separator.
3.  **Sub-Grids:** The separator divides the input grid into two distinct sub-grids of equal dimensions: one above the separator (Top Sub-grid) and one below it (Bottom Sub-grid).
4.  **Output Data:** The output is also a grid of integers, but the values are only 0 and 3.
5.  **Dimensionality:** The output grid's dimensions (rows and columns) are identical to the dimensions of the Top and Bottom Sub-grids derived from the input.
6.  **Transformation:** The core operation appears to be a comparison between the corresponding cells of the Top and Bottom Sub-grids. The result of this comparison determines the value of the corresponding cell in the output grid.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Objects:
  - InputGrid:
      description: The primary input, a 2D array of integers.
      properties:
        - values: [0, 2, 4]
        - contains_separator: true
  - OutputGrid:
      description: The resulting 2D array of integers.
      properties:
        - values: [0, 3]
        - dimensions: Matches the dimensions of the input sub-grids.
  - SeparatorRow:
      description: A row within the InputGrid consisting solely of the value 4.
      properties:
        - value: 4
        - function: Divides InputGrid into Top and Bottom Sub-grids.
  - TopSubGrid:
      description: The portion of the InputGrid above the SeparatorRow.
      properties:
        - dimensions: Same as OutputGrid.
  - BottomSubGrid:
      description: The portion of the InputGrid below the SeparatorRow.
      properties:
        - dimensions: Same as OutputGrid.
  - Cell:
      description: An individual element within a grid.
      properties:
        - row_index
        - column_index
        - value

Actions:
  - Split: Dividing the InputGrid into TopSubGrid and BottomSubGrid using the SeparatorRow.
  - Compare: Element-wise comparison between cells at the same position (row, column) in TopSubGrid and BottomSubGrid.
  - Assign: Setting the value of a cell in the OutputGrid based on the comparison result.

Relationships:
  - OutputGrid dimensions == TopSubGrid dimensions == BottomSubGrid dimensions.
  - OutputGrid[r, c] depends on TopSubGrid[r, c] and BottomSubGrid[r, c].
  - The comparison rule: OutputGrid[r, c] is 0 if TopSubGrid[r, c] == BottomSubGrid[r, c], otherwise it is 3.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate Separator:** Scan the input grid row by row to find the row composed entirely of the integer 4. This is the separator row.
2.  **Extract Sub-grids:**
    *   Define the "Top Sub-grid" as all rows in the input grid preceding the separator row.
    *   Define the "Bottom Sub-grid" as all rows in the input grid following the separator row.
3.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid (the "Output Grid") with the same number of rows and columns as the Top Sub-grid (or Bottom Sub-grid).
4.  **Compare and Populate:** Iterate through each cell position, identified by its row index `r` and column index `c`, within the dimensions of the sub-grids.
    *   For each position (`r`, `c`):
        *   Retrieve the value from the Top Sub-grid at (`r`, `c`). Let this be `value_top`.
        *   Retrieve the value from the Bottom Sub-grid at (`r`, `c`). Let this be `value_bottom`.
        *   Compare `value_top` and `value_bottom`.
        *   If `value_top` is identical to `value_bottom`, set the cell value in the Output Grid at position (`r`, `c`) to 0.
        *   If `value_top` is different from `value_bottom`, set the cell value in the Output Grid at position (`r`, `c`) to 3.
5.  **Finalize:** Once all cell positions have been processed, the populated Output Grid is the final result.
