Input:
  type: 2D grid
  dimensions: 9x9
  elements: integers (0, 1, 8)
  properties:
    - Contains background elements (0).
    - Contains foreground elements (1, 8) forming patterns.
    - Contains multiple (observed as 4 in training examples) 3x3 subgrids composed entirely of 1s and 8s.
Output:
  type: 2D grid
  dimensions: 3x3
  elements: integers (1, 8)
  properties:
    - Represents a specific subgrid extracted from the input.
    - Contains no background elements (0).
Relationship:
  - The output grid is a copy of one specific 3x3 subgrid found within the input grid.
  - This specific subgrid is chosen from the set of all 3x3 subgrids that contain only the numbers 1 and 8.
  - The selection criterion is based on maximizing a property of the subgrid.
Action:
  - Scan the input grid to locate all possible 3x3 subgrids.
  - Filter these subgrids to identify the candidates: those containing only 1s and 8s (no 0s).
  - For each candidate subgrid, count the number of occurrences of the digit 1.
  - Select the candidate subgrid that has the highest count of the digit 1. (Assume uniqueness based on examples).
  - Extract and return this selected 3x3 subgrid.
