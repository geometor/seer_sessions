Input:
  type: 2D grid
  dimensions: 9x9
  elements: integers (0, 1, 8)
  properties:
    - Contains background elements (0).
    - Contains foreground elements (1, 8) forming patterns.
    - Contains exactly one 3x3 subgrid composed entirely of 1s and 8s.
Output:
  type: 2D grid
  dimensions: 3x3
  elements: integers (1, 8)
  properties:
    - Represents a specific subgrid extracted from the input.
    - Contains no background elements (0).
Relationship:
  - The output grid is a direct copy of the unique 3x3 subgrid found within the input grid that contains only the numbers 1 and 8.
Action:
  - Scan the input grid to locate all possible 3x3 subgrids.
  - Filter these subgrids to find the one that does not contain any 0s.
  - Extract and return this identified 3x3 subgrid.
