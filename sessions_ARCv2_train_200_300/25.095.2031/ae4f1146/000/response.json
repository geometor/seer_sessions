The digit 0 appears to function as a background or padding element, while the digits 1 and 8 form meaningful patterns. The core operation seems to be identifying a specific 3x3 subgrid within the input based on its composition. In all provided examples, there is exactly one 3x3 subgrid that consists solely of the digits 1 and 8. This unique 3x3 subgrid is then extracted directly to form the output.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
