**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves processing a larger input grid (9x9) containing the digits 0, 1, and 8, and extracting a smaller output grid (3x3). The digit 0 appears to function as a background or padding element, while the digits 1 and 8 form meaningful patterns. The core operation seems to be identifying a specific 3x3 subgrid within the input based on its composition. In all provided examples, there is exactly one 3x3 subgrid that consists solely of the digits 1 and 8. This unique 3x3 subgrid is then extracted directly to form the output.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: 2D grid
  dimensions: 9x9
  elements: integers (0, 1, 8)
  properties:
    - Contains background elements (0).
    - Contains foreground elements (1, 8) forming patterns.
    - Contains exactly one 3x3 subgrid composed entirely of 1s and 8s.
Output:
  type: 2D grid
  dimensions: 3x3
  elements: integers (1, 8)
  properties:
    - Represents a specific subgrid extracted from the input.
    - Contains no background elements (0).
Relationship:
  - The output grid is a direct copy of the unique 3x3 subgrid found within the input grid that contains only the numbers 1 and 8.
Action:
  - Scan the input grid to locate all possible 3x3 subgrids.
  - Filter these subgrids to find the one that does not contain any 0s.
  - Extract and return this identified 3x3 subgrid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through all possible 3x3 subgrids within the 9x9 input grid. This involves checking subgrids starting at row indices 0 through 6 and column indices 0 through 6.
2.  For each 3x3 subgrid, examine all its 9 elements.
3.  Identify the subgrid where none of the elements is the number 0 (i.e., all elements are either 1 or 8).
4.  Return this identified 3x3 subgrid as the output.
