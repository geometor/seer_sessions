"""
This module transforms an input grid by selecting specific columns.

The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Receive the input grid, which has 5 rows and 17 columns.
2. Identify the columns from the input grid located at the following zero-based indices: 0, 1, 8, 15, and 16.
3. Construct a new output grid with 5 rows and 5 columns.
4. Place the selected input column at index 0 as the first column (index 0) of the output grid.
5. Place the selected input column at index 1 as the second column (index 1) of the output grid.
6. Place the selected input column at index 8 as the third column (index 2) of the output grid.
7. Place the selected input column at index 15 as the fourth column (index 3) of the output grid.
8. Place the selected input column at index 16 as the fifth column (index 4) of the output grid.
9. Return the constructed output grid.
