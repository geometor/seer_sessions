Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both grids (matrices) containing single digits (0-9).
*   The input grids consistently have 5 rows and 17 columns.
*   The output grids consistently have 5 rows and 5 columns.
*   The transformation reduces the number of columns while keeping the number of rows the same.
*   Comparing the content, the digits in the output grid seem to be directly copied from specific columns of the input grid.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
input_format:
  type: grid
  rows: 5
  columns: 17
  cell_type: integer (0-9)
output_format:
  type: grid
  rows: 5
  columns: 5
  cell_type: integer (0-9)
transformation:
  type: column_selection
  description: Selects specific columns from the input grid to form the output grid.
  selected_columns:
    - index: 0 # First column
    - index: 1 # Second column
    - index: 8 # Ninth column
    - index: 15 # Sixteenth column
    - index: 16 # Seventeenth column
  output_column_order: Matches the order of selected input columns [0, 1, 8, 15, 16]
relationships:
  - output_rows == input_rows
  - output_columns < input_columns
  - each_output_column corresponds_to a_specific_input_column
  - each_output_cell corresponds_to the_cell_in_the_same_row_of_the_selected_input_column
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid, which has 5 rows and 17 columns.
2.  Identify the columns from the input grid located at the following zero-based indices: 0, 1, 8, 15, and 16.
3.  Construct a new output grid with 5 rows and 5 columns.
4.  Place the selected input column at index 0 as the first column (index 0) of the output grid.
5.  Place the selected input column at index 1 as the second column (index 1) of the output grid.
6.  Place the selected input column at index 8 as the third column (index 2) of the output grid.
7.  Place the selected input column at index 15 as the fourth column (index 3) of the output grid.
8.  Place the selected input column at index 16 as the fifth column (index 4) of the output grid.
9.  Return the constructed output grid.
