Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids (10x10) containing single-digit integers.
2.  **Input Content:** The input grids consist solely of 0s and 1s. The 1s appear sparsely distributed.
3.  **Output Content:** The output grids contain integers ranging from 0 to 8.
4.  **Transformation Core:** The transformation seems centered around the locations of the '1's in the input grid. Each '1' in the input acts as a trigger or a seed.
5.  **Pattern Generation:** Each '1' in the input grid generates a specific cross-shaped pattern of numbers in the output grid, centered at the position of the original '1'.
    *   The cell corresponding to the input '1' becomes '1' in the output.
    *   The cell immediately above becomes '2'.
    *   The cell immediately below becomes '8'.
    *   The cell immediately to the left becomes '7'.
    *   The cell immediately to the right becomes '6'.
6.  **Boundary Conditions:** The patterns are placed only within the grid boundaries. If a part of the pattern (e.g., the cell above a '1' in the top row) falls outside the grid, it is simply omitted.
7.  **Overlapping Patterns:** When the patterns generated by different input '1's overlap in the output grid, the values seem to simply overwrite each other. The final value of a cell is determined by the pattern originating from the '1' that last dictates its value according to the described rules (though the order of application doesn't affect the final state, as each cell's value is uniquely determined by its relationship to nearby input '1's).
8.  **Background:** Cells in the input that are '0' remain '0' in the output, unless they are overwritten by a part of a pattern generated by a nearby '1'.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new 10x10 grid, `output_grid`, initialized with all zeros.
2.  Iterate through each cell of the `input_grid` at row `r` and column `c`.
3.  If the value of the cell `input_grid[r][c]` is 1:
    a.  Set the value of the corresponding cell `output_grid[r][c]` to 1.
    b.  If the cell directly above exists (i.e., `r > 0`), set `output_grid[r-1][c]` to 2.
    c.  If the cell directly below exists (i.e., `r < 9`), set `output_grid[r+1][c]` to 8.
    d.  If the cell directly to the left exists (i.e., `c > 0`), set `output_grid[r][c-1]` to 7.
    e.  If the cell directly to the right exists (i.e., `c < 9`), set `output_grid[r][c+1]` to 6.
4.  After iterating through all cells in the `input_grid`, the `output_grid` contains the final transformed result.
