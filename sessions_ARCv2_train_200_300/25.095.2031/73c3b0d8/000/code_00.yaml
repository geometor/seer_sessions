task_type: grid_transformation
components:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D array representing the state.
    properties:
      - cells: Contains integer values (0, 2, 4).
  - type: element
    value: 4
    description: Represents a movable object subject to gravity.
    behavior: Falls downwards within its column.
  - type: element
    value: 0
    description: Represents empty space.
  - type: element
    value: 2
    description: Represents an impassable boundary element.
    properties:
      - arrangement: Forms a continuous horizontal row.
      - immutability: Position and value remain unchanged.
rules:
  - rule: boundary_identification
    description: Identify the row composed entirely of 2s. This row acts as the primary stopping point.
  - rule: gravity_simulation
    description: Process each column independently from bottom to top (above the boundary).
    steps:
      - Identify all 4s in the column above the boundary.
      - Clear the original positions of these 4s (set to 0).
      - Determine the lowest available landing spot for each identified 4, starting from the row just above the boundary or the highest settled 4 in that column.
      - Place the 4s sequentially into their final settled positions within the column.
constraints:
  - Movement is purely vertical (within columns).
  - Objects (4s) cannot pass through the boundary (2s) or other settled objects (4s).
  - The boundary row (2s) is static.
