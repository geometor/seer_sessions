            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are 2D grids (matrices) of integers.\n2.  **Transformation Type:** The core transformation appears to be a form of scaling or \"pixel expansion\". Each cell in the input grid corresponds to a square block of cells in the output grid.\n3.  **Block Content:** The value within each expanded block in the output grid is identical to the value of the corresponding cell in the input grid. This includes blocks filled with zeros if the input cell was zero.\n4.  **Block Size (Scaling Factor):** The size of the square blocks (e.g., 3x3 in train\\_1, 2x2 in train\\_2, 5x5 in train\\_3) is consistent within a single input-output pair but varies between pairs.\n5.  **Determining Block Size:** Observing the relationship between the input grid and the scaling factor:\n    *   Train 1: Input has 3 non-zero values (4, 8, 6). Block size is 3x3.\n    *   Train 2: Input has 2 non-zero values (2, 7). Block size is 2x2.\n    *   Train 3: Input has 5 non-zero values (6, 9, 3, 2, 7). Block size is 5x5.\n    *   It appears the scaling factor (side length of the block) is equal to the *count* of non-zero elements in the input grid.\n6.  **Output Grid Dimensions:** The dimensions of the output grid are directly related to the input grid dimensions and the scaling factor. If the input is `R x C` and the scaling factor is `S`, the output is `(R * S) x (C * S)`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
