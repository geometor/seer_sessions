Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** A 9x9 grid containing integer values.
2.  **Output Grid:** A 6x6 grid containing integer values.
3.  **Dividers:** Each input grid features a single row and a single column completely filled with the value '8'. These act as dividers, partitioning the 9x9 grid.
4.  **Key Regions:** The '8' dividers effectively separate the input grid into four quadrants, although the dividers themselves occupy space. The crucial information seems to reside in two specific regions defined relative to these dividers:
    *   A 2x2 region containing the values that will populate the output grid (the "Value Map").
    *   A 6x6 region containing a pattern of 0s and 3s that dictates the structure of the output (the "Pattern Grid"). The '3's mark locations where values should be placed.
5.  **Transformation:** The output grid is constructed based on the "Pattern Grid". Where the Pattern Grid has a '3', the corresponding cell in the output grid is filled with a value from the "Value Map". The specific value chosen depends on which 3x3 quadrant of the Pattern Grid the '3' resides in. Where the Pattern Grid has a '0', the output grid also has a '0'.

relationships:
  - type: partitioning
    subject: input_grid
    objects: [divider_row, divider_column]
    details: Dividers split the input grid into four conceptual regions.

  - type: extraction
    subject: input_grid
    objects: [value_map, pattern_grid]
    details: The value_map (2x2) and pattern_grid (6x6) are extracted from specific regions of the input_grid determined by the dividers.

  - type: mapping
    subject: pattern_grid
    object: output_grid
    using: value_map
    details: |
      The output_grid is generated based on the pattern_grid.
      If pattern_grid[r][c] == 0, then output_grid[r][c] = 0.
      If pattern_grid[r][c] == 3, then output_grid[r][c] is determined by the corresponding value in value_map based on the 3x3 quadrant of (r, c) within the 6x6 pattern_grid:
      - Top-Left quadrant (rows 0-2, cols 0-2) uses value_map[0][0].
      - Top-Right quadrant (rows 0-2, cols 3-5) uses value_map[0][1].
      - Bottom-Left quadrant (rows 3-5, cols 0-2) uses value_map[1][0].
      - Bottom-Right quadrant (rows 3-5, cols 3-5) uses value_map[1][1].

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate Dividers:** Scan the 9x9 input grid to find the row index (`div_r`) and column index (`div_c`) that are entirely filled with the value 8.
2.  **Identify Regions:** Determine the four rectangular regions created by these dividers.
3.  **Extract Value Map:** Identify the 2x2 region among the four that does *not* contain the dividers. Extract the four values from this region into a 2x2 array, `value_map = [[v00, v01], [v10, v11]]`.
4.  **Extract Pattern Grid:** Identify the 6x6 region among the four that does *not* contain the dividers. Extract the values from this region into a 6x6 array, `pattern_grid`.
5.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new 6x6 grid, `output_grid`, filled with zeros.
6.  **Apply Pattern and Values:** Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the `pattern_grid` (from row `r=0` to `5`, column `c=0` to `5`):
    *   Check the value `p = pattern_grid[r][c]`.
    *   If `p` is 3:
        *   Determine the quadrant:
            *   If `r < 3` and `c < 3`, use `value = v00`.
            *   If `r < 3` and `c >= 3`, use `value = v01`.
            *   If `r >= 3` and `c < 3`, use `value = v10`.
            *   If `r >= 3` and `c >= 3`, use `value = v11`.
        *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = value`.
7.  **Return Result:** The final `output_grid` is the result of the transformation.
