The core operation seems to be identifying the locations of the 1s and drawing a specific shape (a plus sign) centered at the midpoint between them using the value 3.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Scan the input grid to find the row and column coordinates of the two cells that contain the value 1. Let these coordinates be (r1, c1) and (r2, c2).\n    3.  Calculate the integer midpoint coordinates (mr, mc) between these two points using the formula: `mr = (r1 + r2) // 2` and `mc = (c1 + c2) // 2`. (Using integer division assumes the midpoint falls exactly on a grid cell or halfway between cells, and we take the floor).\n    4.  Identify the set of five coordinates representing the plus shape centered at the midpoint: the midpoint itself (mr, mc), and its four orthogonal neighbors: (mr-1, mc), (mr+1, mc), (mr, mc-1), (mr, mc+1).\n    5.  For each coordinate in this set of five, update the corresponding cell in the output grid to the value 3, provided the cell is within the grid boundaries. (The examples suggest the original 1s are not overwritten, which is naturally handled if the midpoint and its neighbors don't coincide with the original 1s)."
