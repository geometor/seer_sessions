The cells containing '0' remain unchanged.\n    *   The change from '5' to '2' seems dependent on the local neighborhood of the cell. Specifically, '5's that are \"interior\" to a shape change, while those on the \"boundary\" do not.\n    *   Comparing the two examples reveals that the definition of \"interior\" isn't simply being surrounded orthogonally by other '5's (as seen in the 'U' shape in train\\_2).\n    *   Considering the 8 neighbors (orthogonal and diagonal) provides a consistent rule: A cell changes from 5 to 2 if it has more than 5 non-zero neighbors. Otherwise, it remains 5. Cells with 0 remain 0.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
