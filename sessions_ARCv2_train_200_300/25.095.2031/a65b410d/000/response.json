            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input is a 2D grid containing mostly zeros (0) and a single horizontal segment of twos (2).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output is also a 2D grid of the same dimensions as the input.\n3.  **Key Object:** The horizontal segment of cells with value 2 is the primary object influencing the transformation. Its position (row index) and length are crucial.\n4.  **Transformation Areas:** The transformation affects the cells above and below this segment of 2s. The segment of 2s itself remains unchanged in the output.\n5.  **Filling Values:** Cells below the segment are changed to ones (1), and cells above are changed to threes (3).\n6.  **Filling Pattern:**\n    *   The filling forms triangular shapes extending outwards from the segment.\n    *   The number of filled cells (1s or 3s) in each row depends on the row's distance from the segment and the segment's length.\n    *   The filled cells in each row are always left-aligned, starting from the same column as the segment begins.\n    *   Specifically, for the area below (value 1), the number of 1s in a row decreases by one for each row further away from the segment.\n    *   For the area above (value 3), the number of 3s in a row increases by one for each row further away (moving upwards) from the segment.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
