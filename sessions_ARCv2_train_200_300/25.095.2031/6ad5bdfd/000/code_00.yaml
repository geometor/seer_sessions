task_name: shift_non_zeros_left_preserving_first
data_type: grid_of_integers
dimensionality: primarily_1D_processing # Each row/list processed independently
objects:
  - name: grid_row
    properties:
      - elements: list_of_integers
      - length: integer
  - name: element
    properties:
      - value: integer
      - position: index (integer)
      - is_zero: boolean
      - is_first: boolean
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    between: elements
    details: elements are ordered sequentially within a row
actions:
  - name: identify_fixed_element
    inputs: grid_row
    outputs: element (the first one)
  - name: filter_non_zeros
    inputs: grid_row (excluding the first element)
    outputs: list_of_non_zero_elements (maintaining relative order)
  - name: construct_output_row
    inputs:
      - fixed_element
      - filtered_non_zero_elements
      - original_row_length
    outputs: new_grid_row
    process: place fixed_element at start, append filtered_non_zero_elements, pad with zeros to match original length
constraints:
  - The first element of each input row remains in the first position of the output row.
  - The relative order of the non-zero elements (excluding the first) is preserved.
  - The length of the output row is the same as the length of the input row.
