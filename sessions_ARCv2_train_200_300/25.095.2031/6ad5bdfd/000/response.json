For `train_1`, each line seems to be processed independently.\n*   Each line contains integer values, primarily single digits, including zero.\n*   The core operation appears to involve rearranging the non-zero elements within each line while keeping the very first element fixed.\n*   Zeroes seem to act as empty space or placeholders.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
