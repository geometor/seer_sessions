**General Assessment and Strategy**

1.  **Rule Identification:** The core task involves identifying which of three distinct transformation rules applies to the input grid based on the properties of its first and last columns. The three rules identified are:
    *   **Type 1 (Left Shift):** Triggered when the first column is constant and non-zero. Operates row-wise.
    *   **Type 2 (Gravity):** The default rule when Type 1 and Type 3 conditions are not met. Operates column-wise.
    *   **Type 3 (Right Shift):** Triggered when the last column is constant and non-zero. Operates row-wise.
2.  **Code Logic vs. Expected Output:** The provided code successfully implements the *selection* logic between these three rules and contains implementations for each rule. The "Transformed Output" shown in the results accurately reflects the output of *this specific code*. However, this output does not perfectly match the "Expected Output" for every example, leading to reported errors (Pixels Off > 0).
    *   In `train_1`, the code applies the Left Shift rule. The output matches the expected output for most rows, but differs for row 4.
    *   In `train_2`, the code applies the Gravity rule. The output differs from the expected output in column 4.
    *   In `train_3`, the code applies the Right Shift rule. The output matches the expected output for most rows, but differs for row 5.
3.  **Inconsistencies:** The discrepancies suggest either:
    *   The "Expected Output" contains anomalies or follows slightly nuanced rules not captured by the general pattern observed across the majority of rows/columns for each rule type.
    *   The code's implementation of the individual rules, while standard (e.g., basic gravity, basic shift), might need refinement to capture these nuances if perfect matching is required.
4.  **Strategy:** The natural language program and YAML facts should be updated to reflect the three-rule structure and the conditions for triggering each. The description of each rule should match the logic implemented in the provided code's helper functions (`_apply_left_shift`, `_apply_gravity`, `_apply_right_shift`), as this generated the actual "Transformed Output" shown. The goal is to accurately describe the transformation *implemented* by the code, which correctly handles the high-level structure of the task, even if it doesn't perfectly replicate the target outputs in all details.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Analyze Input Grid:** Examine the first and last columns of the input grid.
    *   Check if all elements in the first column are identical and non-zero.
    *   Check if all elements in the last column are identical and non-zero.
2.  **Select Transformation Rule:**
    *   **If** the first column is constant and non-zero, select the **Left Shift Rule (Type 1)**.
    *   **Else if** the last column is constant and non-zero, select the **Right Shift Rule (Type 3)**.
    *   **Otherwise**, select the **Gravity Rule (Type 2)**.
3.  **Execute Selected Rule:**
    *   **Left Shift Rule (Type 1):** Process each row independently. For a given row:
        a.  Keep the first element in its original position.
        b.  Collect all other non-zero elements from the row, maintaining their relative order.
        c.  Place these collected non-zero elements immediately to the right of the first element.
        d.  Fill all remaining positions to the right with zeros, ensuring the output row has the same length as the input row.
    *   **Right Shift Rule (Type 3):** Process each row independently. For a given row:
        a.  Keep the last element in its original position.
        b.  Collect all other non-zero elements from the row, maintaining their relative order.
        c.  Place these collected non-zero elements immediately to the left of the last element.
        d.  Fill all remaining positions at the beginning of the row with zeros, ensuring the output row has the same length as the input row.
    *   **Gravity Rule (Type 2):** Process the grid column by column.
        a.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with zeros.
        b.  For each column in the input grid:
            i.  Collect all non-zero elements from that column, maintaining their top-to-bottom relative order.
            ii. Place these collected non-zero elements into the corresponding column of the new grid, aligning them at the bottom. The positions above the collected elements in the new grid's column remain zero.
4.  **Return Output Grid:** The result of applying the selected rule is the final output grid.
