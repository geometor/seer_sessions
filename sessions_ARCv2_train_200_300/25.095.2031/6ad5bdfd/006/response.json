            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\n1.  **Rule Identification:** The core task involves identifying which of three distinct transformation rules applies to the input grid based on the properties of its first and last columns. The three rules identified are:\n    *   **Type 1 (Left Shift):** Triggered when the first column is constant and non-zero. Operates row-wise.\n    *   **Type 2 (Gravity):** The default rule when Type 1 and Type 3 conditions are not met. Operates column-wise.\n    *   **Type 3 (Right Shift):** Triggered when the last column is constant and non-zero. Operates row-wise.\n2.  **Code Logic vs. Expected Output:** The provided code successfully implements the *selection* logic between these three rules and contains implementations for each rule. The \"Transformed Output\" shown in the results accurately reflects the output of *this specific code*. However, this output does not perfectly match the \"Expected Output\" for every example, leading to reported errors (Pixels Off > 0).\n    *   In `train_1`, the code applies the Left Shift rule. The output matches the expected output for most rows, but differs for row 4.\n    *   In `train_2`, the code applies the Gravity rule. The output differs from the expected output in column 4.\n    *   In `train_3`, the code applies the Right Shift rule. The output matches the expected output for most rows, but differs for row 5.\n3.  **Inconsistencies:** The discrepancies suggest either:\n    *   The \"Expected Output\" contains anomalies or follows slightly nuanced rules not captured by the general pattern observed across the majority of rows/columns for each rule type.\n    *   The code's implementation of the individual rules, while standard (e.g., basic gravity, basic shift), might need refinement to capture these nuances if perfect matching is required.\n4.  **Strategy:** The natural language program and YAML facts should be updated to reflect the three-rule structure and the conditions for triggering each. The description of each rule should match the logic implemented in the provided code's helper functions (`_apply_left_shift`, `_apply_gravity`, `_apply_right_shift`), as this generated the actual \"Transformed Output\" shown. The goal is to accurately describe the transformation *implemented* by the code, which correctly handles the high-level structure of the task, even if it doesn't perfectly replicate the target outputs in all details.\n\n**Metrics and Verification**\n"
