Non-zero numbers form distinct, contiguous shapes or objects within the grid. Some shapes are composed of a single non-zero number (uniform shapes), while others are composed of multiple different non-zero numbers (non-uniform shapes). The transformation modifies some shapes based on the pattern of another shape.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
