The values within the grid are limited to 0, 1, and 4.\n2.  **Delimiter:** A distinct feature is the vertical column of '1's always present at the 5th column (index 4). This column appears to act as a separator, dividing the input grid into two 6x4 sections (columns 0-3 and columns 5-8).\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output is a grid with 6 rows and 4 columns. The values are limited to 0 and 8. The dimensions match the sections identified in the input grid.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve comparing the two 6x4 sections of the input grid (left and right of the '1's column) to produce the 6x4 output grid. The '1's column itself is discarded.\n5.  **Value Mapping:** The values 0 and 4 in the input sections seem to determine the values 0 and 8 in the output. Specifically, comparing corresponding cells (same row and column index within their respective sections) from the left and right sections dictates the output cell value.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
