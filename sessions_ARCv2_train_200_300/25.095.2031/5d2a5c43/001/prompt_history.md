Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input consists of grids with 6 rows and 9 columns. The values within the grid are limited to 0, 1, and 4.
2.  **Delimiter:** A distinct feature is the vertical column of '1's always present at the 5th column (index 4). This column appears to act as a separator, dividing the input grid into two 6x4 sections (columns 0-3 and columns 5-8).
3.  **Output Structure:** The output is a grid with 6 rows and 4 columns. The values are limited to 0 and 8. The dimensions match the sections identified in the input grid.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve comparing the two 6x4 sections of the input grid (left and right of the '1's column) to produce the 6x4 output grid. The '1's column itself is discarded.
5.  **Value Mapping:** The values 0 and 4 in the input sections seem to determine the values 0 and 8 in the output. Specifically, comparing corresponding cells (same row and column index within their respective sections) from the left and right sections dictates the output cell value.

      For each cell position (r, c):
      If left_subgrid[r, c] == 0 AND right_subgrid[r, c] == 0, then output_grid[r, c] = 0.
      Otherwise (if either or both are 4), output_grid[r, c] = 8.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the 6x9 input grid.
2.  Identify the column containing only '1's (column index 4) as the delimiter.
3.  Extract the left subgrid consisting of columns 0 through 3 of the input grid.
4.  Extract the right subgrid consisting of columns 5 through 8 of the input grid.
5.  Initialize an empty 6x4 output grid.
6.  Iterate through each row index `r` from 0 to 5 and each column index `c` from 0 to 3.
7.  For the current `(r, c)`, get the value `left_val` from the left subgrid at `(r, c)`.
8.  Get the value `right_val` from the right subgrid at `(r, c)`.
9.  Check if both `left_val` is 0 and `right_val` is 0.
10. If both are 0, set the value of the output grid at `(r, c)` to 0.
11. Otherwise (if at least one of `left_val` or `right_val` is 4), set the value of the output grid at `(r, c)` to 8.
12. After iterating through all `(r, c)` positions, return the completed output grid.
