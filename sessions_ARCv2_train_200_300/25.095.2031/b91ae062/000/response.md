Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input:** A small grid (matrix) of single digits. In all examples, the input is a 3x3 grid.
2.  **Output:** A larger grid (matrix) of single digits. The dimensions of the output grid vary between examples.
3.  **Transformation:** The output grid appears to be a scaled-up version of the input grid, where each cell from the input is expanded into a square block of identical digits in the output.
4.  **Scaling Factor:** The size of the square block (and thus the overall scaling of the grid) seems to vary. Let's call this the scaling factor `S`. The output grid dimensions are `input_rows * S` by `input_cols * S`.
5.  **Determining the Scaling Factor:** Observing the examples, the scaling factor `S` appears to be equal to the number of *unique non-zero digits* present in the input grid.
    *   train_1: Input has {8, 6, 9}. 3 unique non-zero digits. Scale `S=3`. Output 9x9.
    *   train_2: Input has {1, 4}. 2 unique non-zero digits. Scale `S=2`. Output 6x6.
    *   train_3: Input has {3, 2, 7}. 3 unique non-zero digits. Scale `S=3`. Output 9x9.
    *   train_4: Input has {4, 3, 2, 8}. 4 unique non-zero digits. Scale `S=4`. Output 12x12.
    *   train_5: Input has {6, 7}. 2 unique non-zero digits. Scale `S=2`. Output 6x6.
6.  **Block Replication:** Each cell `(r, c)` in the input grid, containing digit `d`, corresponds to an `S x S` block in the output grid. This block starts at output grid coordinates `(r * S, c * S)` and is filled entirely with the digit `d`.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Grid Scaling by Unique Non-Zero Digit Count

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Contains single digits (0-9)
    - Represents a 2D matrix
  Examples_Dimension: 3x3 (for all training cases)

Output:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Contains single digits (0-9)
    - Represents a 2D matrix
    - Dimensions are scaled relative to the input grid

Transformation:
  Name: Block Scaling
  Steps:
    - Determine Scaling Factor:
        - Identify all unique non-zero digits in the input grid.
        - Count the number of unique non-zero digits. This count is the Scaling Factor (S).
    - Create Output Grid:
        - Calculate output dimensions: `output_rows = input_rows * S`, `output_cols = input_cols * S`.
        - Initialize an empty output grid of these dimensions.
    - Populate Output Grid:
        - Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid.
        - Let the digit in the input cell `(r, c)` be `d`.
        - Identify the corresponding block in the output grid: This block covers rows from `r * S` to `(r * S) + S - 1` and columns from `c * S` to `(c * S) + S - 1`.
        - Fill all cells within this `S x S` block in the output grid with the digit `d`.

Relationships:
  - Output grid dimensions depend on input grid dimensions and the calculated Scaling Factor.
  - The Scaling Factor depends on the content (unique non-zero digits) of the input grid.
  - Each cell value in the input grid dictates the value of all cells within a corresponding block in the output grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input grid.
2.  Find all the unique digits present in the input grid, excluding the digit 0.
3.  Count how many unique non-zero digits were found. Let this count be the `scale_factor`.
4.  Determine the dimensions of the input grid: `input_rows` and `input_cols`.
5.  Calculate the dimensions of the output grid: `output_rows = input_rows * scale_factor`, `output_cols = input_cols * scale_factor`.
6.  Create a new grid (the output grid) with dimensions `output_rows` by `output_cols`.
7.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid using its row index `r` (from 0 to `input_rows - 1`) and column index `c` (from 0 to `input_cols - 1`).
8.  Get the digit `d` located at `input_grid[r][c]`.
9.  Determine the top-left corner of the corresponding block in the output grid: `start_row = r * scale_factor`, `start_col = c * scale_factor`.
10. Fill the `scale_factor` x `scale_factor` block in the output grid, starting at `(start_row, start_col)`, entirely with the digit `d`. Specifically, for every row index `out_r` from `start_row` to `start_row + scale_factor - 1`, and for every column index `out_c` from `start_col` to `start_col + scale_factor - 1`, set `output_grid[out_r][out_c] = d`.
11. After iterating through all input cells, the output grid is complete. Return the output grid.
