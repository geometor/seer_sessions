Task: Grid Scaling by Unique Non-Zero Digit Count

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Contains single digits (0-9)
    - Represents a 2D matrix
  Examples_Dimension: 3x3 (for all training cases)

Output:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Contains single digits (0-9)
    - Represents a 2D matrix
    - Dimensions are scaled relative to the input grid

Transformation:
  Name: Block Scaling
  Steps:
    - Determine Scaling Factor:
        - Identify all unique non-zero digits in the input grid.
        - Count the number of unique non-zero digits. This count is the Scaling Factor (S).
    - Create Output Grid:
        - Calculate output dimensions: `output_rows = input_rows * S`, `output_cols = input_cols * S`.
        - Initialize an empty output grid of these dimensions.
    - Populate Output Grid:
        - Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid.
        - Let the digit in the input cell `(r, c)` be `d`.
        - Identify the corresponding block in the output grid: This block covers rows from `r * S` to `(r * S) + S - 1` and columns from `c * S` to `(c * S) + S - 1`.
        - Fill all cells within this `S x S` block in the output grid with the digit `d`.

Relationships:
  - Output grid dimensions depend on input grid dimensions and the calculated Scaling Factor.
  - The Scaling Factor depends on the content (unique non-zero digits) of the input grid.
  - Each cell value in the input grid dictates the value of all cells within a corresponding block in the output grid.
