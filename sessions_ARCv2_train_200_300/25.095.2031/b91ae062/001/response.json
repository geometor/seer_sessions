Identify all unique non-zero digits in the input grid.\n2. Count these unique non-zero digits to get the scaling factor 'S'.\n3. Create an output grid with dimensions (input_rows * S) x (input_cols * S).\n4. For each cell (r, c) containing digit 'd' in the input grid, fill the corresponding S x S block starting at output grid coordinates (r * S, c * S) with the digit 'd'.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport math  # Not strictly necessary for this solution, but good practice to include common math lib\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the block scaling transformation to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid of digits.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the scaled output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Determine Scaling Factor ---\n    unique_digits = set()\n    # Flatten the grid and find unique non-zero digits\n    for row in input_grid:\n        for digit in row:\n            if digit != 0:\n                unique_digits.add(digit)\n\n    scale_factor = len(unique_digits)\n\n    # Handle edge case where input might be all zeros (though not in examples)\n    # If the input grid has dimensions but contains only zeros, \n    # the scale_factor would be 0 based on the rule. \n    # An output grid of size 0x0 is problematic.\n    # Let's default to a scale_factor of 1 if the calculated factor is 0 but the grid is not empty.\n    # However, observing train_3 and train_5, zero rows/cols in input become zero blocks in output,\n    # scaled by the factor derived from non-zero elements.
