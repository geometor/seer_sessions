Objects:
  - Grid: A 2D array of digits.
    Properties:
      - rows: Number of rows.
      - columns: Number of columns.
  - Cell: An element within the Grid.
    Properties:
      - row_index: The 0-based row number.
      - column_index: The 0-based column number.
      - value: The digit ('2', '5', '7', '8') stored in the cell.

Relationships:
  - Location: Cells have specific (row, column) coordinates.
  - Rightmost '8': The '8' with the largest column index in the entire grid.
  - First Row with '8': The lowest row index containing any '8'.
  - First Row with Rightmost '8': The lowest row index containing an '8' at the column of the Rightmost '8'.
  - Last Row with '2': The highest row index containing a '2'.
  - Column Offset: A target column is often determined by adding 2 to the column index of a key digit ('8' or '2').

Actions:
  - Scan Grid: Iterate through cells to find specific digits ('8', '2').
  - Identify Key Locations: Determine the column of the rightmost '8', the row/column of relevant '2's, and first/last rows containing key digits.
  - Conditional Modification: Change cell values to '5' based on the identified key locations and specific row ranges.
