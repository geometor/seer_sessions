The grids are represented as text, with digits separated by spaces within a row, and rows separated by newlines.\n2.  **Grid Content:** The grids primarily consist of the digit '7'. Digits '8' and '2' appear in specific locations in the input. The digit '5' appears in the output, replacing existing digits ('7' in the examples).\n3.  **Transformation Nature:** The transformation selectively changes certain cells to '5' based on the presence and location of '8's or '2's in the input grid. The rest of the grid remains unchanged. The rules for placing '5' seem to depend on whether '8' is present.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Scan the entire input grid to determine if the digit '8' is present.\n3.  **If the digit '8' is present:**\n    a.  Find the maximum column index (`C_max8`) where an '8' appears in any row of the input grid.\n    b.  Calculate the target column index for modification: `C_target = C_max8 + 2`.\n    c.  Find the minimum row index (`R_first_any8`) containing any '8'.\n    d.  Find the minimum row index (`R_first_max8`) containing an '8' specifically in column `C_max8`.\n    e.  Determine the starting row index (`R_start`) for modification:\n        i.  If `R_first_any8` is equal to `R_first_max8`, set `R_start = 1`.\n        ii. Otherwise (if they are different), set `R_start = R_first_max8 - 1`.\n    f.  Iterate through all rows from `R_start` down to the last row index of the grid. For each row `R` in this range, change the value of the cell at `(R, C_target)` in the output grid to '5'.\n4.  **If the digit '8' is NOT present:**\n    a.  Scan the entire input grid to determine if the digit '2' is present.\n    b.  **If the digit '2' is present:**\n        i.  Find the maximum row index (`R_last2`) where a '2' appears in the input grid.\n        ii. Find the column index (`C_2`) of the '2' located in row `R_last2`. (Assuming a consistent column for '2' if multiple '2's exist in that row, or take the first one encountered).\n        iii. Calculate the target column index for modification: `C_target = C_2 + 2`.\n        iv. Change the value of the single cell at `(R_last2, C_target)` in the output grid to '5'.\n5.  **(Implicit) If neither '8' nor '2' is present:** The output grid remains unchanged from the initial copy.\n6.
