Objects:
  - Grid: A 2D array of digits.
    Properties:
      - rows: Number of rows.
      - columns: Number of columns.
  - Cell: An element within the Grid.
    Properties:
      - row_index: The 0-based row number.
      - column_index: The 0-based column number.
      - value: The digit ('2', '5', '7', '8') stored in the cell.

Derived Properties/Locations:
  - Has '8': Boolean indicating if any cell contains '8'.
  - Has '2': Boolean indicating if any cell contains '2'.
  - Rightmost '8' Column (C_max8): The largest column index where an '8' appears.
  - First Row with any '8' (R_first_any8): The smallest row index containing any '8'.
  - First Row with Rightmost '8' (R_first_max8): The smallest row index containing an '8' specifically in column C_max8.
  - Last Row with '2' (R_last2): The largest row index containing a '2'.
  - Column of '2' in Last Row (C_last2): The column index of a '2' in row R_last2 (if multiple, use the smallest column index).
  - Target Column from '8' (C_target_from_8): Calculated as C_max8 + 2.
  - Target Column from '2' (C_target_from_2): Calculated as C_last2 + 2.

Actions:
  - Scan Grid: Iterate through cells to find locations of specific digits ('8', '2').
  - Calculate Key Indices: Determine C_max8, R_first_any8, R_first_max8, R_last2, C_last2 based on scan results.
  - Conditional Modification: Change cell values to '5' based on the presence/absence of '8' and '2', and the relationships between the key indices.
