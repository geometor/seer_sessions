Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for these grid examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are grids (matrices) of single digits. The grids are represented as text, with digits separated by spaces within a row, and rows separated by newlines.
2.  **Grid Content:** The grids primarily consist of the digit '7'. Digits '8' and '2' appear in specific locations in the input. The digit '5' appears in the output, replacing existing digits ('7' in the examples).
3.  **Transformation Nature:** The transformation selectively changes certain cells to '5' based on the presence and location of '8's or '2's in the input grid. The rest of the grid remains unchanged. The rules for placing '5' seem to depend on whether '8' is present.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Objects:
  - Grid: A 2D array of digits.
    Properties:
      - rows: Number of rows.
      - columns: Number of columns.
  - Cell: An element within the Grid.
    Properties:
      - row_index: The 0-based row number.
      - column_index: The 0-based column number.
      - value: The digit ('2', '5', '7', '8') stored in the cell.

Relationships:
  - Location: Cells have specific (row, column) coordinates.
  - Rightmost '8': The '8' with the largest column index in the entire grid.
  - First Row with '8': The lowest row index containing any '8'.
  - First Row with Rightmost '8': The lowest row index containing an '8' at the column of the Rightmost '8'.
  - Last Row with '2': The highest row index containing a '2'.
  - Column Offset: A target column is often determined by adding 2 to the column index of a key digit ('8' or '2').

Actions:
  - Scan Grid: Iterate through cells to find specific digits ('8', '2').
  - Identify Key Locations: Determine the column of the rightmost '8', the row/column of relevant '2's, and first/last rows containing key digits.
  - Conditional Modification: Change cell values to '5' based on the identified key locations and specific row ranges.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the entire input grid to determine if the digit '8' is present.
3.  **If the digit '8' is present:**
    a.  Find the maximum column index (`C_max8`) where an '8' appears in any row of the input grid.
    b.  Calculate the target column index for modification: `C_target = C_max8 + 2`.
    c.  Find the minimum row index (`R_first_any8`) containing any '8'.
    d.  Find the minimum row index (`R_first_max8`) containing an '8' specifically in column `C_max8`.
    e.  Determine the starting row index (`R_start`) for modification:
        i.  If `R_first_any8` is equal to `R_first_max8`, set `R_start = 1`.
        ii. Otherwise (if they are different), set `R_start = R_first_max8 - 1`.
    f.  Iterate through all rows from `R_start` down to the last row index of the grid. For each row `R` in this range, change the value of the cell at `(R, C_target)` in the output grid to '5'.
4.  **If the digit '8' is NOT present:**
    a.  Scan the entire input grid to determine if the digit '2' is present.
    b.  **If the digit '2' is present:**
        i.  Find the maximum row index (`R_last2`) where a '2' appears in the input grid.
        ii. Find the column index (`C_2`) of the '2' located in row `R_last2`. (Assuming a consistent column for '2' if multiple '2's exist in that row, or take the first one encountered).
        iii. Calculate the target column index for modification: `C_target = C_2 + 2`.
        iv. Change the value of the single cell at `(R_last2, C_target)` in the output grid to '5'.
5.  **(Implicit) If neither '8' nor '2' is present:** The output grid remains unchanged from the initial copy.
6.  Return the final output grid.
