Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input is consistently a 4x14 grid of single-digit integers.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output is consistently a 4x4 grid of single-digit integers.
3.  **Key Features in Input:** Columns 4 and 9 in the input grids always consist solely of the digit '2'. These columns appear to act as delimiters or separators.
4.  **Input Blocks:** These delimiters effectively partition the input grid (excluding the delimiters themselves) into three distinct 4x4 blocks:
    *   Block A: Columns 0-3
    *   Block B: Columns 5-8
    *   Block C: Columns 10-13
5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The output grid seems to be formed by selectively combining values from the corresponding positions within these three input blocks (A, B, and C).
6.  **Selection Logic:** For each position (row `r`, column `c`) in the output grid, the value appears to be chosen based on a priority system applied to the values at `(r, c)` in Block A, Block B, and Block C. Specifically, the non-zero value from the earliest block (A then B then C) is chosen. If all corresponding values in A, B, and C are zero, the output is zero (which is the value from Block C).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Combine three 4x4 blocks from a 4x14 input grid into a single 4x4 output grid based on a priority rule.
grid_dimensions:
  input:
    rows: 4
    columns: 14
  output:
    rows: 4
    columns: 4
input_elements:
  - type: grid
    data_type: integer
    range: 0-9
output_elements:
  - type: grid
    data_type: integer
    range: 0-9
input_structure:
  - name: Block A
    location: columns 0-3
    dimensions: 4x4
  - name: Delimiter 1
    location: column 4
    value: constant(2)
  - name: Block B
    location: columns 5-8
    dimensions: 4x4
  - name: Delimiter 2
    location: column 9
    value: constant(2)
  - name: Block C
    location: columns 10-13
    dimensions: 4x4
transformation_logic:
  - action: partitioning
    input: input grid
    delimiters: columns 4 and 9
    outputs: Block A, Block B, Block C
  - action: combination
    inputs: Block A, Block B, Block C
    output: output grid
    rule: For each cell (r, c):
            output[r, c] = BlockA[r, c] if BlockA[r, c] != 0
                           else BlockB[r, c] if BlockB[r, c] != 0
                           else BlockC[r, c]
    priority: Block A > Block B > Block C (for non-zero values)
relationships:
  - The output grid's dimensions match the dimensions of the identified input blocks (A, B, C).
  - Each cell in the output grid corresponds directly to cells at the same row/column index within input blocks A, B, and C.
  - Delimiter columns (4 and 9) are ignored in the final output generation.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Divide the 4x14 input grid into three 4x4 data blocks (Block A: columns 0-3, Block B: columns 5-8, Block C: columns 10-13), ignoring the delimiter columns 4 and 9 which contain only '2's.
2.  Initialize an empty 4x4 output grid.
3.  Iterate through each cell position (row `r`, column `c`) from `r=0` to `3` and `c=0` to `3`.
4.  For the current cell `(r, c)`:
    a.  Retrieve the value from Block A at `(r, c)` (let's call it `val_A`).
    b.  Retrieve the value from Block B at `(r, c)` (let's call it `val_B`).
    c.  Retrieve the value from Block C at `(r, c)` (let's call it `val_C`).
    d.  Determine the output value: If `val_A` is not zero, use `val_A`. Otherwise, if `val_B` is not zero, use `val_B`. Otherwise, use `val_C`.
    e.  Assign the determined value to the output grid at position `(r, c)`.
5.  The final 4x4 output grid is the result.
