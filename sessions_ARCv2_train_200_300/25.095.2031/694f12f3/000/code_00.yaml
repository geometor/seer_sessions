Objects:
  - name: Grid
    properties:
      - cells: 2D array of integers (colors)
      - dimensions: height, width
  - name: Rectangle
    properties:
      - color: 4 (blue)
      - solid: true (no holes)
      - bounding_box: min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col
      - height: H (number of rows)
      - width: W (number of columns)
    parts:
      - Border: The outermost cells of the rectangle.
      - Interior: The cells inside the border.
  - name: FillColor
    properties:
      - value: 1 (red) or 2 (green)

Relationships:
  - Rectangle is composed of Border and Interior cells.
  - Rectangle is located within the Grid.
  - FillColor depends on Rectangle's height (H) and width (W).

Actions:
  - Identify: Find connected components of color 4.
  - Validate: Check if a component forms a solid rectangle.
  - Calculate: Determine height (H) and width (W) of each rectangle.
  - Compare: Compare H and W.
  - Determine FillColor: Apply rules based on H/W comparison and values.
    - Rule 1: If H > W, FillColor is 2.
    - Rule 2: If W > H, FillColor is W - H.
    - Rule 3: If H == W:
        - If H > 4, FillColor is 2.
        - If H <= 4, FillColor is 1.
  - Modify: Change the color of the Interior cells of the Rectangle in the output grid to the determined FillColor. Keep the Border cells as color 4.
