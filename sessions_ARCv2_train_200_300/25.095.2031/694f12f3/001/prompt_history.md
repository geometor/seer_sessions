Okay, let's analyze the task provided in the examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** Both input and output are 2D grids of integers.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are 0 (background, black), 4 (blue). The output introduces colors 1 (red) and 2 (green).
3.  **Objects:** The input grids contain solid rectangular shapes made of color 4, surrounded by the background color 0.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation modifies the *interior* of the color 4 rectangles. The border of the rectangles (the outermost layer of color 4 cells) remains unchanged. The interior cells are replaced with either color 1 or color 2.
5.  **Rule Determination:** The specific color (1 or 2) used to fill the interior depends on the dimensions (height and width) of the original color 4 rectangle.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Objects:
  - name: Grid
    properties:
      - cells: 2D array of integers (colors)
      - dimensions: height, width
  - name: Rectangle
    properties:
      - color: 4 (blue)
      - solid: true (no holes)
      - bounding_box: min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col
      - height: H (number of rows)
      - width: W (number of columns)
    parts:
      - Border: The outermost cells of the rectangle.
      - Interior: The cells inside the border.
  - name: FillColor
    properties:
      - value: 1 (red) or 2 (green)

Relationships:
  - Rectangle is composed of Border and Interior cells.
  - Rectangle is located within the Grid.
  - FillColor depends on Rectangle's height (H) and width (W).

Actions:
  - Identify: Find connected components of color 4.
  - Validate: Check if a component forms a solid rectangle.
  - Calculate: Determine height (H) and width (W) of each rectangle.
  - Compare: Compare H and W.
  - Determine FillColor: Apply rules based on H/W comparison and values.
    - Rule 1: If H > W, FillColor is 2.
    - Rule 2: If W > H, FillColor is W - H.
    - Rule 3: If H == W:
        - If H > 4, FillColor is 2.
        - If H <= 4, FillColor is 1.
  - Modify: Change the color of the Interior cells of the Rectangle in the output grid to the determined FillColor. Keep the Border cells as color 4.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find all distinct, connected groups (components) of cells with color 4.
3.  For each identified component of color 4:
    a.  Determine the bounding box (minimum/maximum row and column indices) of the component.
    b.  Verify that the component perfectly fills its bounding box, confirming it is a solid rectangle. If it is not a solid rectangle, ignore this component and proceed to the next.
    c.  Calculate the height (H) and width (W) of the rectangle from its bounding box dimensions (H = max_row - min_row + 1, W = max_col - min_col + 1).
    d.  Determine the appropriate fill color (either 1 or 2) based on the rectangle's dimensions (H and W) using the following prioritized rules:
        i.  If the height (H) is strictly greater than the width (W), the fill color is 2.
        ii. Else, if the width (W) is strictly greater than the height (H), the fill color is the result of subtracting the height from the width (W - H).
        iii. Else (if height H equals width W):
            1.  If the height (H) is greater than 4, the fill color is 2.
            2.  If the height (H) is less than or equal to 4, the fill color is 1.
    e.  Identify the interior cells of the rectangle. These are the cells within the bounding box *excluding* the cells on the border (i.e., cells at `min_row`, `max_row`, `min_col`, or `max_col`).
    f.  For every interior cell identified, update its value in the output grid to the fill color determined in step 3d.
4.  Return the final modified output grid.
