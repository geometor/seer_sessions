"""
Transforms a 10x10 grid by:
1. Identifying a shape outlined by color 5 on a background of color 0.
2. Finding a specific gap (0 surrounded horizontally by 5s) in column 5 within this shape.
3. Flood-filling the interior region enclosed by the shape (5) starting from a point adjacent to the gap, changing background pixels (0) to fill color (8). The shape boundary (5) is respected and not crossed.
4. Determining the vertical extent (min/max rows) of the filled area.
5. Drawing a vertical line using fill color (8) in column 5. This line extends from the gap row towards the nearest grid edge (top or bottom), directed away from the main body of the filled area. The line does not overwrite the shape boundary pixels (5).
