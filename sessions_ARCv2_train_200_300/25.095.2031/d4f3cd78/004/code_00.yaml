task_description: Fill the interior of a shape defined by color 5 with color 8, respecting the shape as a boundary. Then, identify a horizontal gap (5,0,5) in column 5. Draw a vertical line (color 8) in column 5 extending from the gap row towards the nearest grid edge (top or bottom), directed away from the main filled interior region. The line should not overwrite the original shape pixels (5).

elements:
  - object: Grid
    properties:
      - size: 10x10
      - type: 2D array of integers
  - object: Background
    properties:
      - color_value: 0
      - role: The default color, can be replaced by Fill/Line.
  - object: ShapeBoundary
    properties:
      - color_value: 5
      - role: Defines the boundary of a region to be filled. Remains unmodified.
      - structure: Forms a single connected component, typically U/C shaped, containing a specific gap feature.
  - object: Gap
    properties:
      - pattern: Horizontal sequence [ShapeBoundary(5), Background(0), ShapeBoundary(5)]
      - column_index: 5 (0-indexed) # Based on examples
      - role: Anchor point for the vertical line and helps identify interior/exterior relative position.
  - object: Fill
    properties:
      - color_value: 8
      - role: Fills the interior region enclosed by ShapeBoundary. Replaces Background(0).
  - object: VerticalLine
    properties:
      - color_value: 8
      - column_index: 5 # Based on examples
      - role: Extends vertically from the Gap's row towards the nearest edge (top/bottom), away from the main filled area. Replaces Background(0) or existing Fill(8), but critically *not* ShapeBoundary(5).

actions:
  - action: FindGapRow
    input: Grid, ShapeBoundaryColor(5), BackgroundColor(0), GapColumn(5)
    output: RowIndexOfGap or None
    description: Locate the row index containing the specific horizontal gap pattern [5, 0, 5] centered in the designated column (5).
  - action: FindInteriorSeedPoint
    input: Grid, GapRow, GapColumn, BackgroundColor(0)
    output: SeedPointCoordinates (row, col) or None
    description: Identify a Background(0) pixel adjacent (preferably vertically) to the gap, positioned inside the shape boundary, to initiate the fill.
  - action: FloodFillInterior
    input: GridToModify, SeedPoint, FillColor(8), TargetColor(0), BoundaryColor(5)
    output: Modified Grid with InteriorRegion filled
    description: Starting from the SeedPoint, perform a 4-directional flood fill. Change connected TargetColor(0) pixels to FillColor(8). Treat BoundaryColor(5) pixels as impassable walls; do not cross or modify them. Modifies the grid in place.
  - action: GetFilledOrShapeAreaBounds
    input: Grid, FillColor(8), ShapeColor(5)
    output: MinRow, MaxRow or None, None
    description: Find the minimum and maximum row indices containing the FillColor. If no FillColor exists, find bounds based on ShapeColor. Return bounds, handling cases where neither exists.
  - action: DrawVerticalLine
    input: GridToModify, OriginalGrid, GapRow, GapColumn(5), MinBoundRow, MaxBoundRow, LineColor(8), ShapeBoundaryColor(5)
    output: Modified Grid with vertical line added
    description: Determine direction based on GapRow relative to Min/MaxBoundRow (away from main bounded area). Draw LineColor(8) pixels in GapColumn(5) from GapRow towards the nearest edge (row 0 or last row) in that direction. Critically, only modify pixels in GridToModify if the corresponding pixel in OriginalGrid was *not* ShapeBoundaryColor(5).

relationships:
  - type: Enclosure
    subject: ShapeBoundary (5)
    object: InteriorRegion (0 changing to 8 via FloodFillInterior)
    description: The ShapeBoundary spatially contains the InteriorRegion. The FloodFillInterior action respects this boundary.
  - type: Anchoring
    subject: VerticalLine (8)
    object: Gap
    description: The VerticalLine originates at the row of the Gap in column 5.
  - type: Directionality
    subject: VerticalLine (8)
    object: FilledOrShapeAreaBounds
    description: The VerticalLine extends away from the main area (defined by Min/MaxBoundRow) relative to the GapRow, towards the closer vertical grid edge.
