            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code failed consistently across both training examples. The core issue identified was the flood fill implementation, which incorrectly filled all background pixels (0) instead of only those enclosed by the shape boundary (5). The fill algorithm did not properly respect the `boundary_color`.\n\nThe strategy involves:\n1.  **Correcting the Flood Fill:** Implement a flood fill algorithm that explicitly uses the `shape_color` (5) as an impenetrable boundary, ensuring only connected `background_color` (0) pixels reachable from an interior seed point *without crossing the boundary* are filled with `fill_color` (8).\n2.  **Verifying Seed Point Logic:** Ensure the seed point for the flood fill is correctly identified as being inside the shape boundary. The current heuristic (adjacent to the gap) seems appropriate for the given examples.\n3.  **Maintaining Line Logic:** The logic for identifying the gap row and drawing the vertical line (in column 5, extending from the gap row away from the main filled area towards the nearest edge, avoiding overwriting the original shape) appears correct based on re-analysis and should be preserved.\n\n**Metrics Analysis (from `code_output`)**\n\n*   **Grid Dimensions:** Consistently 10x10 for both input and output.\n*   **Color Palette:** Inputs use {0, 5}. Outputs use {0, 5, 8}. This matches expectations.\n*   **Color Counts:** The number of '5' pixels remains constant from input to output, confirming the shape is preserved. '0' pixels decrease, and '8' pixels appear, consistent with filling and line drawing.\n*   **Gap Location:** A horizontal `[5, 0, 5]` pattern is found centered at column 5. The row varies: row 5 in Example 1, row 7 in Example 2.\n*   **Filled Area:** Pixels with value 8 form a connected region inside the shape boundary and the vertical line.\n*   **Vertical Line:** Appears in column 5 in the output.\n    *   Example 1: Gap at row 5. Filled interior region is primarily rows 6-8. The line extends *upwards* from row 5 to row 0. Direction: Up (away from rows 6-8).\n    *   Example 2: Gap at row 7. Filled interior region is primarily rows 3-6. The line extends *downwards* from row 7 to row 9. Direction: Down (away from rows 3-6).\n*   **Conclusion:** The metrics confirm the core understanding of the task: find a gap, flood fill the interior defined by the shape, and draw a line from the gap away from the filled area. The primary failure was the flood fill implementation detail (boundary handling).\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Define key values: `shape_color = 5`, `background_color = 0`, `fill_color = 8`, `gap_column = 5`.\n3.  **Find the Gap Row:** Iterate through rows of the `input_grid` to find the index `gap_row` where `input_grid[gap_row, gap_column-1] == shape_color`, `input_grid[gap_row, gap_column] == background_color`, and `input_grid[gap_row, gap_column+1] == shape_color`. If no `gap_row` is found, return the `output_grid` as is.\n4.  **Find Interior Seed Point:** Determine a starting coordinate (`seed_row`, `seed_col`) for the flood fill. Check the cell below the gap (`gap_row + 1`, `gap_column`) and the cell above (`gap_row - 1`, `gap_column`). Use the first of these that exists within grid bounds and has the `background_color`. If neither works, set `seed_point` to None.\n5.  **Flood Fill Interior:** If a valid `seed_point` was found:\n    *   Perform a flood fill on the `output_grid` starting from `seed_point`.\n    *   Use a queue and a `visited` set to manage exploration.\n    *   Only fill cells that currently contain `background_color`. Change them to `fill_color`.\n    *   Do not add cells to the queue if they are outside grid bounds, already visited, contain the `shape_color`, or contain the `fill_color`.\n    *   Mark cells as visited when they are processed or identified as boundaries/already filled.\n6.  **Determine Area Bounds:** Examine the `output_grid`. Find the minimum (`min_bound_row`) and maximum (`max_bound_row`) row indices that contain the `fill_color`. If no `fill_color` is present, find the minimum and maximum row indices containing the `shape_color`. If neither color exists, use `gap_row` for both `min_bound_row` and `max_bound_row`.\n7.  **Draw Vertical Line:**\n    *   Compare `gap_row` to `min_bound_row` and `max_bound_row` to determine the primary location of the filled/shape area relative to the gap.\n    *   If `gap_row < min_bound_row` (gap is above the main area), the line direction is upwards. Iterate from `r = 0` to `gap_row` (inclusive).\n    *   If `gap_row > max_bound_row` (gap is below the main area), the line direction is downwards. Iterate from `r = gap_row` to `grid_height - 1` (inclusive).\n    *   For each row `r` in the determined range (upwards or downwards): check if the *original* pixel `input_grid[r, gap_column]` is *not* equal to `shape_color`. If it is not, set the *output* pixel `output_grid[r, gap_column]` to `fill_color`.\n    *   If neither condition (`gap_row < min_bound_row` or `gap_row > max_bound_row`) was met (i.e., the gap is within the bounds), ensure the pixel at the gap itself `output_grid[gap_row, gap_column]` is set to `fill_color` if `input_grid[gap_row, gap_column]` was originally `background_color`.\n8.  Return the final `output_grid`."
