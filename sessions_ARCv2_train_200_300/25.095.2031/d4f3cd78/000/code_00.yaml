task_description: Fill the interior of a shape defined by color 5 with color 8, and draw a vertical line (color 8) in column 5 extending from the shape's horizontal bar away from the filled interior towards the nearest grid edge.

elements:
  - object: Grid
    properties:
      - size: 10x10
      - type: 2D array of integers
  - object: Background
    properties:
      - color_value: 0
  - object: ShapeBoundary
    properties:
      - color_value: 5
      - role: Defines the boundary of a region
      - structure: Forms a single connected, closed component with a horizontal bar containing a single pixel gap.
  - object: Fill
    properties:
      - color_value: 8
      - role: Fills the interior region enclosed by ShapeBoundary
  - object: VerticalLine
    properties:
      - color_value: 8
      - column_index: 5
      - role: Extends vertically from the ShapeBoundary's horizontal bar

actions:
  - action: IdentifyShapeInterior
    description: Find the connected region of Background pixels enclosed by ShapeBoundary pixels.
  - action: FloodFill
    input: Grid, InteriorRegionStartPoint, FillColor (8)
    output: Modified Grid with InteriorRegion filled
    description: Change the color value of pixels within the identified interior region to the FillColor.
  - action: IdentifyHorizontalBar
    input: Grid, ShapeBoundaryColor (5)
    output: RowIndexOfBar
    description: Find the row index containing the horizontal segment of the ShapeBoundary with a gap.
  - action: DrawVerticalLine
    input: Grid, ColumnIndex (5), StartRow, EndRow, LineColor (8)
    output: Modified Grid with vertical line
    description: Change the color value of pixels in the specified column between StartRow and EndRow (inclusive) to LineColor.

relationships:
  - type: Enclosure
    subject: ShapeBoundary (5)
    object: InteriorRegion (0 changing to 8)
    description: The ShapeBoundary surrounds the InteriorRegion.
  - type: Extension
    subject: VerticalLine (8)
    object: ShapeBoundary (5)
    description: The VerticalLine starts at the row of the ShapeBoundary's horizontal bar (with the gap) in column 5 and extends away from the filled interior towards the nearest vertical edge of the grid.
