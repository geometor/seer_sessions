This shape remains unchanged in the output.\n    *   `8`: Appears only in the output. It's used to fill an area enclosed by the shape (5) and to draw a vertical line extending from that shape.\n3.  **Shape**: The pixels with value 5 form a single, connected, closed shape in both examples. The shape resembles a 'U' or 'C' with a horizontal bar that has a single-pixel gap.\n4.  **Transformation - Filling**: The primary transformation involves filling the area enclosed by the shape (5). The background pixels (0) inside the shape are changed to 8.\n5.  **Transformation - Vertical Line**: An additional vertical line of 8s is drawn in column 5 (0-indexed). This line extends from the row containing the horizontal bar of the shape (specifically, the row with the gap) towards the nearest grid edge (top or bottom), away from the main body of the filled shape.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all pixels with the background color `0` that are enclosed within the shape formed by pixels with color `5`. (This can be done using a flood fill algorithm starting from a known interior point, or by iterating through pixels and checking for enclosure).\n3.  Change the color of these enclosed background pixels from `0` to `8` in the output grid.\n4.  Locate the row index (`bar_row`) containing the horizontal segment of the shape `5` which has a single-pixel gap (e.g., `5 5 5 0 5 5`).\n5.  Determine the minimum (`min_fill_row`) and maximum (`max_fill_row`) row indices of the area filled with `8` in step 3.\n6.  If the `bar_row` is above the filled area (`bar_row < min_fill_row`), then draw a vertical line of `8`s in column 5 from `bar_row` up to row 0 (inclusive).\n7.  If the `bar_row` is below the filled area (`bar_row > max_fill_row`), then draw a vertical line of `8`s in column 5 from `bar_row` down to the last row of the grid (row 9, inclusive).\n8.
