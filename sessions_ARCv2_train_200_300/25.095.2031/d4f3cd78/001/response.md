"""
This program transforms a 10x10 grid based on the following rules:
1. It identifies a shape outlined by the number 5 on a background of 0.
2. It fills the interior region enclosed by the shape (5) with the number 8. The interior region consists of pixels initially having the value 0.
3. It identifies a horizontal segment of the shape (5) that contains a single-pixel gap (a 0 surrounded by 5s horizontally) located specifically in column 5.
4. It draws a vertical line using the number 8 in column 5. This line extends from the row containing the gap towards the nearest top or bottom edge of the grid, stopping at the edge. The direction of extension (up or down) is away from the main body of the filled area.
