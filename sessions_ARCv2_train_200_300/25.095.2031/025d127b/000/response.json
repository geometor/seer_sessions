The value '0' appears to represent the background. Non-zero values (e.g., 8, 6, 2) form distinct shapes or patterns within the grid.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation observed is a horizontal shift of the non-zero elements. In both examples, all non-zero elements are shifted one position to the right.\n4.  **Shape Integrity:** The shapes formed by the non-zero numbers maintain their relative structure during the shift.\n5.  **Background:** The background '0' fills the space vacated by the shifted shapes and remains in the areas not occupied by the shapes in the output.\n6.  **Multiple Objects:** The task handles grids with single shapes (train\\_1) and multiple, distinct shapes (train\\_2, identified by different non-zero numbers) consistently. Each shape is shifted independently but by the same amount.\n7.  **Shift Amount:** The shift is consistently one column to the right in the provided examples.\n8.  **Boundary Conditions:** The examples don't explicitly show what happens if a shape element is shifted beyond the right boundary of the grid. However, based on the pattern, it's likely clipped or disappears. Elements shifted into a column from the left appear normally.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
