task_type: grid_transformation
input_description: A 2D grid of integers representing a background (0) and one or more shapes (non-zero integers).
output_description: A 2D grid of the same dimensions as the input, where the shapes from the input have been shifted horizontally.
objects:
  - id: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions (rows, columns)
      - cells containing integer values
  - id: shape
    properties:
      - composed_of: non-zero integer value(s)
      - location: set of coordinates within the grid
      - color_value: the specific non-zero integer representing the shape
  - id: background
    properties:
      - represented_by: integer value 0
relationships:
  - shapes are contained within the grid
  - shapes are distinct from the background
actions:
  - identify: locate all cells with non-zero values in the input grid.
  - shift: move each identified non-zero cell one position to the right.
  - construct_output: create a new grid, placing the shifted non-zero values at their new coordinates and filling the remaining cells with the background value (0).
constraints:
  - the grid dimensions remain constant.
  - the relative structure of each shape is preserved.
  - all non-zero elements undergo the same shift transformation.
  - the shift direction is horizontal (positive column direction).
  - the shift magnitude is 1 column.
