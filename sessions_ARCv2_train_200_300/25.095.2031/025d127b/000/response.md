**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) of integers.
2.  **Grid Content:** The grids contain integer values. The value '0' appears to represent the background. Non-zero values (e.g., 8, 6, 2) form distinct shapes or patterns within the grid.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation observed is a horizontal shift of the non-zero elements. In both examples, all non-zero elements are shifted one position to the right.
4.  **Shape Integrity:** The shapes formed by the non-zero numbers maintain their relative structure during the shift.
5.  **Background:** The background '0' fills the space vacated by the shifted shapes and remains in the areas not occupied by the shapes in the output.
6.  **Multiple Objects:** The task handles grids with single shapes (train\_1) and multiple, distinct shapes (train\_2, identified by different non-zero numbers) consistently. Each shape is shifted independently but by the same amount.
7.  **Shift Amount:** The shift is consistently one column to the right in the provided examples.
8.  **Boundary Conditions:** The examples don't explicitly show what happens if a shape element is shifted beyond the right boundary of the grid. However, based on the pattern, it's likely clipped or disappears. Elements shifted into a column from the left appear normally.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
input_description: A 2D grid of integers representing a background (0) and one or more shapes (non-zero integers).
output_description: A 2D grid of the same dimensions as the input, where the shapes from the input have been shifted horizontally.
objects:
  - id: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions (rows, columns)
      - cells containing integer values
  - id: shape
    properties:
      - composed_of: non-zero integer value(s)
      - location: set of coordinates within the grid
      - color_value: the specific non-zero integer representing the shape
  - id: background
    properties:
      - represented_by: integer value 0
relationships:
  - shapes are contained within the grid
  - shapes are distinct from the background
actions:
  - identify: locate all cells with non-zero values in the input grid.
  - shift: move each identified non-zero cell one position to the right.
  - construct_output: create a new grid, placing the shifted non-zero values at their new coordinates and filling the remaining cells with the background value (0).
constraints:
  - the grid dimensions remain constant.
  - the relative structure of each shape is preserved.
  - all non-zero elements undergo the same shift transformation.
  - the shift direction is horizontal (positive column direction).
  - the shift magnitude is 1 column.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with the background value (0).
2.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid at row `r` and column `c`.
3.  Retrieve the value `v` at `input[r][c]`.
4.  If `v` is not the background value (0):
    a.  Calculate the new column index `new_c = c + 1`.
    b.  Check if `new_c` is a valid column index within the grid's boundaries (i.e., less than the total number of columns).
    c.  If `new_c` is valid, set the value of the output grid at row `r` and column `new_c` to `v`.
5.  After iterating through all input cells, the initialized and updated output grid represents the final result. Return the output grid.
