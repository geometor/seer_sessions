Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

## Perception of Elements

The task involves transforming a 2D grid of integers based on the spatial relationship between two distinct, non-background "objects" within the grid.

1.  **Grid:** The input is a rectangular grid of single-digit integers.
2.  **Background:** One integer value dominates the grid and acts as the background color. This background remains unchanged in the output grid, except in the region between the two objects.
3.  **Objects:** There are exactly two distinct, connected regions (objects) in the input grid composed of colors different from the background. In the examples, these objects appear to be solid rectangles. Let's call them Object 1 and Object 2.
4.  **Separation & Overlap:** The two objects are separated by the background color along one primary axis (either horizontally or vertically). They might share the same coordinates along the secondary axis (e.g., same rows if separated horizontally, or same columns if separated vertically). The transformation occurs within the region of this overlap on the secondary axis.
5.  **Filling:** The core transformation is filling the background area *between* the two objects, but only within their overlapping range on the secondary axis. The filling uses the colors of the respective objects.
6.  **Filling Rule:** The filling extends from each object towards the other. The way the space is divided depends on the size of the gap between them and the axis of separation:
    *   **Even Gap:**
