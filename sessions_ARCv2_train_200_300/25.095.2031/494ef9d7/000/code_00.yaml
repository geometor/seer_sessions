task_elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D array of single digits (0-9).
    properties:
      - rows: Independent units for transformation.
      - cells: Contain digits 0-9. '0' acts as empty space.
transformation_rule:
  scope: row-wise
  conditions:
    - description: Applies only if a row contains exactly two non-zero digits.
      property: count(non_zero_digits) == 2
    - description: The pair of non-zero digits must be {1, 8} or {4, 7}.
      property: set(non_zero_digits) == {1, 8} or set(non_zero_digits) == {4, 7}
  action:
    - description: Move the rightmost non-zero digit.
      target: rightmost_non_zero_digit
      destination: The cell immediately to the right of the leftmost_non_zero_digit.
      effect: The original cell of the moved digit becomes 0.
    - description: Rows not meeting the conditions remain unchanged.
      target: rows_not_meeting_conditions
      effect: No change.
relationships:
  - type: positional
    description: The relative left/right positions of the two non-zero digits determine which one moves and where it lands.
  - type: value-based_trigger
    description: The specific numeric values of the non-zero pair ({1,8} or {4,7}) trigger the movement action.
