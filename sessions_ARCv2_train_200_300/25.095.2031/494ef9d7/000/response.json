            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are grids (2D arrays) of single digits, represented with spaces between columns and newlines between rows. The digits range from 0 to 9.\n2.  **Core Element:** The fundamental units are the individual cells containing digits within the grid. The digit '0' appears to represent empty space or a background.\n3.  **Transformation Scope:** The changes occur within individual rows. The transformation applied to one row does not seem to directly affect other rows.\n4.  **Nature of Change:** Some non-zero digits change their position within a row, moving horizontally. Specifically, they move to the left. Zeros are introduced into the vacated positions. Not all non-zero digits move.\n\n**Detailed Analysis & Pattern Recognition:**\n\n*   **Focus on Rows:** Let's examine rows where changes occur compared to those that don't.\n*   **Condition for Change:** Changes only seem to happen in rows containing *exactly two* non-zero digits. Rows with zero, one, or more than two non-zero digits remain unchanged.\n*   **Specific Pairs:** Examining the rows with exactly two non-zero digits that *do* change reveals a specific pattern in the digit pairs involved:\n    *   In `train_1`: (7, 4), (1, 8), (4, 7), (8, 1) pairs lead to movement.\n    *   In `train_2`: (4, 7) pair leads to movement.\n    *   In `train_3`: (4, 7), (1, 8) pairs lead to movement.\n    *   In `train_4`: (1, 8), (4, 7) pairs lead to movement.\n    *   Conversely, pairs like (8, 9), (6, 7), (2, 4), (3, 9), (6, 4), (9, 2), (1, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4) do *not* lead to movement in the examples.\n*   **Rule Identification:** The movement occurs if and only if a row contains exactly two non-zero digits, and those digits form the pair {1, 8} (i.e., a 1 and an 8) or the pair {4, 7} (i.e., a 4 and a 7).\n*   **Movement Mechanics:** When the condition is met, the rightmost of the two non-zero digits moves to the position immediately to the right of the leftmost digit. The original position of the moved digit becomes 0.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
