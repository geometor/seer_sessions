"""
Transforms a 2D grid based on the location of a '5' and an adjacent connected group of '2's.

1. Finds the location of the number 5 (anchor).
2. Finds any number 2 directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to the 5.
3. If an adjacent 2 is found, performs a search (BFS) starting from that 2 to identify 
   the entire connected component (group) of 2s touching the initial adjacent 2.
4. Changes all the 2s belonging to this identified group to 3s in the output grid.
5. Determines the relative position of the group with respect to the 5 (Left, Right, Above, Below) 
   based on the position of the initial adjacent 2 found.
6. Determines a projection direction orthogonal to the adjacency axis:
    - Group Left of 5 -> Project Up
    - Group Right of 5 -> Project Down
    - Group Above 5 -> Project Right
    - Group Below 5 -> Project Left
7. Determines the starting point for the projection, which is always one cell away 
   from the 5 in the projection direction.
8. Projects a line of 2s, starting from the calculated start point and moving in the
   projection direction. The length of the projected line is equal to the number 
   of cells in the original group of 2s found in step 3. Projection stops if it hits
   the grid boundary.
