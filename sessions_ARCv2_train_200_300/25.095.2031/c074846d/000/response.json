Identifying the anchor (5) and the adjacent target(s) (2s).\n    2.  Changing the color/value of the adjacent 2s to 3s.\n    3.  Projecting new 2s in a direction orthogonal to the adjacency axis, starting from a specific point determined by the relative positions, with the number of projected 2s matching the number of original adjacent 2s.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Find all cells containing the value 2 that are directly adjacent (sharing an edge, not just a corner) to the cell `(r5, c5)`. Store their coordinates in a list, `adjacent_2s`. Let `N` be the number of cells found.\n4.  If no adjacent 2s are found, the output grid is identical to the input grid. Stop.\n5.  Determine the primary relative direction of the `adjacent_2s` group with respect to `(r5, c5)` (e.g., are they mostly to the left, right, above, or below?).\n6.  For each coordinate `(r2, c2)` in `adjacent_2s`, change the value in the output grid at `(r2, c2)` from 2 to 3.\n7.  Determine the projection anchor coordinate and the projection direction vector based on the relative direction found in step 5:\n    *   If `adjacent_2s` are to the LEFT of 5: Anchor is the rightmost coordinate in `adjacent_2s`. Direction vector is `(-1, 0)` (UP).\n    *   If `adjacent_2s` are to the RIGHT of 5: Anchor is the leftmost coordinate in `adjacent_2s`. Direction vector is `(1, 0)` (DOWN).\n    *   If `adjacent_2s` are ABOVE 5: Anchor is `(r5, c5)`. Direction vector is `(0, 1)` (RIGHT).\n    *   If `adjacent_2s` are BELOW 5: Anchor is the topmost coordinate in `adjacent_2s`. Direction vector is `(0, -1)` (LEFT).\n8.  Starting from the position one step away from the anchor in the projection direction, place the value 2 in the output grid. Repeat this `N` times, moving one step further in the projection direction each time. Stop placing 2s if a step would go outside the grid boundaries."
