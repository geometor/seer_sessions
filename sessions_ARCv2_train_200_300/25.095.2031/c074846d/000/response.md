Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid:** A 2D array containing numerical values.
*   **Objects:** The key numbers are 0 (background), 5 (anchor/reference), 2 (target object), and 3 (transformed object).
*   **Relationships:** The core relationship is the adjacency (horizontal or vertical) between the number 5 and one or more number 2s.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Identifying the anchor (5) and the adjacent target(s) (2s).
    2.  Changing the color/value of the adjacent 2s to 3s.
    3.  Projecting new 2s in a direction orthogonal to the adjacency axis, starting from a specific point determined by the relative positions, with the number of projected 2s matching the number of original adjacent 2s.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Transform a grid based on the location of a '5' and adjacent '2's.
grid_dimensions: Variable (examples show different sizes).
elements:
  - object: background
    value: 0
    role: Neutral space
  - object: anchor
    value: 5
    role: Reference point for the transformation
  - object: target
    value: 2
    role: Cells to be modified and used for projection source
  - object: transformed_target
    value: 3
    role: The state of the target cells after transformation
actions:
  - name: locate_anchor
    input: input_grid
    output: coordinates_of_5
  - name: find_adjacent_targets
    input: input_grid, coordinates_of_5
    condition: Find cells with value 2 directly adjacent (not diagonal) to the anchor '5'.
    output: list_of_adjacent_2_coords, relative_direction (e.g., left, right, up, down), count_N
  - name: transform_targets
    input: list_of_adjacent_2_coords
    action: Change the value of cells at these coordinates from 2 to 3 in the output grid.
  - name: determine_projection
    input: relative_direction, list_of_adjacent_2_coords, coordinates_of_5, count_N
    output: projection_anchor_coord, projection_direction_vector, projection_length (N)
    logic:
      - If adjacent '2's are LEFT of '5', anchor is the rightmost '2', direction is UP.
      - If adjacent '2's are RIGHT of '5', anchor is the leftmost '2', direction is DOWN.
      - If adjacent '2's are ABOVE '5', anchor is '5', direction is RIGHT.
      - If adjacent '2's are BELOW '5', anchor is the topmost '2', direction is LEFT.
  - name: execute_projection
    input: projection_anchor_coord, projection_direction_vector, projection_length (N), output_grid
    action: Starting one step from the anchor in the projection direction, place 'N' cells with value 2 along the direction vector, stopping if the grid boundary is reached. Ensure projection doesn't overwrite existing non-zero cells (implicitly handled by examples, as projection areas are always 0).
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: anchor (5), target (2)
    cardinality: one (5) to many (2s, forming a line/group)
    significance: Triggers transformation and projection.
  - type: orthogonality
    between: adjacency_direction, projection_direction
    significance: Determines the axis of projection relative to the axis of adjacency.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Locate the coordinates `(r5, c5)` of the cell containing the value 5.
3.  Find all cells containing the value 2 that are directly adjacent (sharing an edge, not just a corner) to the cell `(r5, c5)`. Store their coordinates in a list, `adjacent_2s`. Let `N` be the number of cells found.
4.  If no adjacent 2s are found, the output grid is identical to the input grid. Stop.
5.  Determine the primary relative direction of the `adjacent_2s` group with respect to `(r5, c5)` (e.g., are they mostly to the left, right, above, or below?).
6.  For each coordinate `(r2, c2)` in `adjacent_2s`, change the value in the output grid at `(r2, c2)` from 2 to 3.
7.  Determine the projection anchor coordinate and the projection direction vector based on the relative direction found in step 5:
    *   If `adjacent_2s` are to the LEFT of 5: Anchor is the rightmost coordinate in `adjacent_2s`. Direction vector is `(-1, 0)` (UP).
    *   If `adjacent_2s` are to the RIGHT of 5: Anchor is the leftmost coordinate in `adjacent_2s`. Direction vector is `(1, 0)` (DOWN).
    *   If `adjacent_2s` are ABOVE 5: Anchor is `(r5, c5)`. Direction vector is `(0, 1)` (RIGHT).
    *   If `adjacent_2s` are BELOW 5: Anchor is the topmost coordinate in `adjacent_2s`. Direction vector is `(0, -1)` (LEFT).
8.  Starting from the position one step away from the anchor in the projection direction, place the value 2 in the output grid. Repeat this `N` times, moving one step further in the projection direction each time. Stop placing 2s if a step would go outside the grid boundaries.
