            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code failed on most examples because it incorrectly identified the group of '2's involved in the transformation and had flawed logic for determining the anchor point and direction of the projection.\n\n**Key Errors Identified:**\n\n1.  **Target Identification:** The code only considered '2's directly adjacent (sharing an edge) with the '5', instead of identifying the entire connected component (group) of '2's that touches the '5'.\n2.  **Projection Anchor/Start Point:** The initial logic for determining the starting cell for the projection (based on the adjacent '2's) was incorrect. The projection consistently starts relative to the position of the '5'.\n3.  **Projection Direction:** While the general orthogonal direction was mostly correct, the exact starting point relative to the '5' needed refinement based on all examples.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  Implement a method (like Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) to find the full connected component of '2's starting from any '2' found adjacent to the '5'.\n2.  Calculate the size (`N`) of this component.\n3.  Determine the relative position (Left, Right, Above, Below) of this component with respect to the '5'.\n4.  Update the output grid by changing all '2's in the identified component to '3's.\n5.  Implement the revised projection logic:\n    *   Determine the correct starting coordinate `(start_r, start_c)` and direction vector `(dr, dc)` based *only* on the relative position of the component to the '5'.\n    *   Project `N` cells with value '2' by iterating `i` from 0 to `N-1` and calculating the target coordinates `(start_r + i*dr, start_c + i*dc)`, checking grid boundaries.\n\n## Metrics and Observations\n\n*   **Common Pattern:** The transformation involves identifying a '5', finding an adjacent line/group of '2's, changing those '2's to '3's, and then projecting a new line of '2's (equal in length to the original group) orthogonally.\n*   **Group Identification:** The core issue in the failing examples (1, 2, 3, 5) stemmed from not identifying the *entire* group of connected '2's adjacent to the '5'. Example 4 worked because the group size was only 1.\n*   **Projection:** The projection always starts one cell away from the '5', in the direction orthogonal to the adjacency axis, and proceeds for a number of steps equal to the size of the original '2's group.\n\n| Example | Input `5` Pos | Adjacent `2`s Group Coords | Group Size (N) | Group Relative Pos | Expected Projection Start | Expected Projection Dir | Expected Projection Coords | Code Output Match | Pixels Off (Original Code) |\n| :------ | :------------ | :------------------------- | :------------- | :----------------- | :------------------------ | :---------------------- | :------------------------- | :---------------- | :------------------------- |\n| 1       | `(3, 4)`      | `{(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)}`    | 3              | Left               | `(2, 4)`                  | `(-1, 0)` (Up)          | `(2,4), (1,4), (0,4)`      | False             | 6                          |\n| 2       | `(1, 1)`      | `{(1, 2)}`                 | 1              | Right              | `(2, 1)`                  | `(1, 0)` (Down)         | `(2,1)`                    | False             | 2                          |\n| 3       | `(4, 4)`      | `{(5,4), (6,4)}`           | 2              | Below              | `(4, 3)`                  | `(0, -1)` (Left)        | `(4,3), (4,2)`             | False             | 4                          |\n| 4       | `(3, 3)`      | `{(2, 3)}`                 | 1              | Above              | `(3, 4)`                  | `(0, 1)` (Right)        | `(3,4)`                    | True              | 0                          |\n| 5       | `(2, 3)`      | `{(2,1), (2,2)}`           | 2              | Left               | `(1, 3)`                  | `(-1, 0)` (Up)          | `(1,3), (0,3)`             | False             | 4                          |\n\n*(Note: The Pixels Off count refers to the discrepancy between the expected output and the output generated by the previous, flawed code version).*\n\n## Updated YAML Facts\n\n"
