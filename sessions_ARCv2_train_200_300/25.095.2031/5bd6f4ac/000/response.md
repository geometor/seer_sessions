**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input:** The input is consistently a 9x9 grid of single-digit integers (0-9).
2.  **Output:** The output is consistently a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (0-9).
3.  **Transformation:** The output grid appears to be a direct sub-grid extracted from the input grid.
4.  **Location:** Comparing the values in the output grids to the input grids across all examples reveals that the output grid corresponds precisely to the 3x3 region located in the top-right corner of the input grid. Specifically, it includes the elements from rows 0, 1, and 2, and columns 6, 7, and 8 of the input grid.
5.  **Content:** The values within the extracted 3x3 subgrid are copied directly to the output grid without modification.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
Task: Subgrid Extraction

Objects:
  - Input_Grid:
      Properties:
        - Type: Grid
        - Dimensions: 9x9
        - Cell_Content: Single-digit integers (0-9)
  - Output_Grid:
      Properties:
        - Type: Grid
        - Dimensions: 3x3
        - Cell_Content: Single-digit integers (0-9)
  - Top_Right_Subgrid:
      Properties:
        - Type: Subgrid of Input_Grid
        - Location: Rows 0-2, Columns 6-8 (using 0-based indexing)
        - Dimensions: 3x3

Action:
  - Name: Extract
  - Source: Input_Grid
  - Target: Output_Grid
  - Method: Select the Top_Right_Subgrid from the Input_Grid.

Relationship:
  - The Output_Grid is identical in content and structure to the Top_Right_Subgrid of the Input_Grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input grid, which is a 9x9 grid of digits.
2.  Select the 3x3 subgrid located in the top-right corner of the input grid. This subgrid spans rows 0 through 2 and columns 6 through 8 (inclusive, using 0-based indexing).
3.  Construct the output grid as a direct copy of this selected 3x3 subgrid.
