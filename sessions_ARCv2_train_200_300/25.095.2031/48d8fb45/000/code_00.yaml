task_elements:
  - Input Grid:
      type: 2D array of integers
      size: 10x10
      properties:
        - Contains digits 0-9.
        - Contains exactly one instance of the digit 5.
        - Contains multiple instances of one other non-zero digit (target_digit).
        - Digit 0 acts as background.
  - Output Grid:
      type: 2D array of integers
      size: 3x3
      properties:
        - Contains only digit 0 and the target_digit from the input.
  - Marker Digit:
      value: 5
      role: Defines the reference point for extraction.
  - Target Digit:
      role: The primary digit to be preserved in the output.
      identification: The most frequent non-zero digit in the input, excluding the marker digit 5.
  - Background Digit:
      value: 0
      role: Fills empty space in input and non-target cells in output.
actions:
  - Find Marker: Locate the row (r5) and column (c5) of the digit 5 in the input grid.
  - Identify Target: Count frequencies of non-zero digits (excluding 5) to find the target_digit.
  - Calculate Extraction Origin: Determine the top-left corner (r_out, c_out) for the 3x3 extraction using the marker location: r_out = r5 + 1, c_out = c5 - 1.
  - Extract Subgrid: Copy the 3x3 portion of the input grid starting at (r_out, c_out).
  - Filter Subgrid: Create the output grid by iterating through the extracted 3x3 subgrid. Keep cells matching the target_digit; replace all others with 0.
relationships:
  - The position of the marker digit 5 dictates the position of the 3x3 subgrid extracted from the input.
  - The identity of the target digit dictates which values are preserved in the final output grid.
