            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task takes a 10x10 grid of single digits as input and produces a 3x3 grid of single digits as output.\n2.  **Digits:** The grids contain digits 0-9. '0' appears to be a background color/digit.\n3.  **Special Digit '5':** Each input grid contains exactly one digit '5'. This digit seems crucial, likely acting as a marker or reference point.\n4.  **Target Digit:** Each input grid also contains multiple instances of another non-zero digit (4 in train_1, 1 in train_2, 2 in train_3). This digit is the *only* non-zero digit present in the corresponding output grid. This suggests it's the primary digit of interest, the 'target digit'.\n5.  **Frequency:** Observing the inputs, the target digit (4, 1, or 2) is the most frequent non-zero digit *besides* the single '5'.\n6.  **Transformation:** The core task is extracting a specific 3x3 region from the input and filtering it. The location of the '5' determines *which* 3x3 region is extracted, and the filtering process keeps only the identified 'target digit'.\n7.  **Extraction Logic:** By comparing the location of the '5' in the input to the content of the output, it appears the output 3x3 grid is extracted from the input starting one row below and one column to the left of the '5's location.\n8.  **Filtering Logic:** After extracting the 3x3 subgrid, any digit within it that is *not* the target digit is replaced with '0'.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Iterate through each cell of the extracted 3x3 subgrid. If a cell's value is equal to the `target_digit`, place the `target_digit` in the corresponding position in the output grid. Otherwise, leave the '0'.\n7.  Return the final 3x3 output grid."
