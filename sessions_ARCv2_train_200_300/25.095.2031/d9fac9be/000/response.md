*   **Perception:** The input is a rectangular grid containing single digits. The output is a single digit. The output digit is always one of the non-zero digits present in the input grid. The task appears to involve analyzing the spatial arrangement of the non-zero digits within the grid. Specifically, it seems to distinguish between digits that form clusters (where identical digits are adjacent horizontally or vertically) and digits that appear scattered (where no identical digits are adjacent). The output corresponds to the digit whose instances are always scattered, never forming adjacent pairs or larger clusters.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - element: input_grid
        description: A 2D array of single-digit integers.
        properties:
          - dimensions: variable rows and columns
          - cell_values: integers from 0 to 9
          - background_value: 0 appears to represent empty space.
          - non_zero_values: represent distinct types of objects or points.
      - element: output_value
        description: A single integer.
        properties:
          - value: corresponds to one of the non_zero_values from the input_grid.

    relationships:
      - relationship: adjacency
        description: Two cells are adjacent if they share a horizontal or vertical edge.
        applies_to: cells with identical non_zero_values in the input_grid.

    derived_objects:
      - object: scattered_digit
        description: A non-zero digit in the input grid such that no two instances of this digit are adjacent horizontally or vertically.
        property: value (the digit itself)
      - object: clustered_digit
        description: A non-zero digit in the input grid such that at least two instances of this digit are adjacent horizontally or vertically.
        property: value (the digit itself)

    transformation:
      rule: Identify all unique non-zero digits present in the input grid. For each unique non-zero digit, check if any instance of that digit is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to another instance of the same digit. The output value is the unique non-zero digit for which no adjacent instances exist (the scattered_digit).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all unique non-zero digits present in the input grid.
    2.  For each unique non-zero digit:
        a.  Iterate through all cells in the grid containing this digit.
        b.  For each such cell, check its horizontal and vertical neighbors.
        c.  If any neighbor contains the same digit, mark this digit as "clustered" and proceed to the next unique digit.
    3.  If, after checking all instances of a digit, no adjacent pairs were found, this digit is the "scattered" digit.
    4.  Output the value of the "scattered" digit.
