The output digit is always one of the non-zero digits present in the input grid. The task appears to involve analyzing the spatial arrangement of the non-zero digits within the grid. Specifically, it seems to distinguish between digits that form clusters (where identical digits are adjacent horizontally or vertically) and digits that appear scattered (where no identical digits are adjacent). The output corresponds to the digit whose instances are always scattered, never forming adjacent pairs or larger clusters.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
