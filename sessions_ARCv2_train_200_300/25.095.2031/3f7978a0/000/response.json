The digits observed are 0, 5, and 8.\n2.  **Core Content:** The digits 5 and 8 seem significant, while 0 appears to be a background or empty value.\n3.  **Structure Preservation:** The relative arrangement of the non-zero digits within a specific region seems mostly preserved from input to output.\n4.  **Dimensionality Change:** The output grid is consistently smaller than the input grid. The transformation involves selecting a specific sub-region of the input.\n5.  **Key Identifier:** The digit '5' appears to play a central role in determining the region to be extracted. The output grid seems centered vertically around the rows containing '5's and horizontally aligned with the columns containing '5's.\n6.  **Boundary Definition:** The output grid's columns exactly span the columns containing at least one '5'. The output grid's rows span the rows containing '5's, plus one additional row above the topmost '5' row and one additional row below the bottommost '5' row.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all cells containing the digit '5'.\n    2. Determine the bounding box of these '5' cells:\n       - min_row_5: Minimum row index containing a '5'.\n       - max_row_5: Maximum row index containing a '5'.\n       - min_col_5: Minimum column index containing a '5'.\n       - max_col_5: Maximum column index containing a '5'.\n    3. Define the output grid boundaries based on the '5' bounding box:\n       - Output_Start_Row: min_row_5 - 1\n       - Output_End_Row: max_row_5 + 1\n       - Output_Start_Col: min_col_5\n       - Output_End_Col: max_col_5\n    4. Extract the subgrid from the Input using these calculated boundaries.\n\nRelationships:\n  - The output grid's content is directly copied from the corresponding subgrid region of the input.\n  - The size and position of the output subgrid are determined solely by the distribution of '5' digits in the input.\n```"
