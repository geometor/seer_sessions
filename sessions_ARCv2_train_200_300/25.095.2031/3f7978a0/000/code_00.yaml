Task: Grid Transformation

Input:
  Type: 2D Grid
  Elements:
    - Digit: 0 (Background)
    - Digit: 5 (Key Object Marker)
    - Digit: 8 (Secondary Object/Context)
  Properties:
    - Variable dimensions

Output:
  Type: 2D Grid
  Elements: Digits from Input (0, 5, 8)
  Properties:
    - Smaller dimensions than Input
    - Represents a subgrid of the Input

Transformation:
  Action: Subgrid Extraction / Cropping
  Rule_Basis: Spatial location of '5' digits in the Input grid.
  Process_Steps:
    1. Identify all cells containing the digit '5'.
    2. Determine the bounding box of these '5' cells:
       - min_row_5: Minimum row index containing a '5'.
       - max_row_5: Maximum row index containing a '5'.
       - min_col_5: Minimum column index containing a '5'.
       - max_col_5: Maximum column index containing a '5'.
    3. Define the output grid boundaries based on the '5' bounding box:
       - Output_Start_Row: min_row_5 - 1
       - Output_End_Row: max_row_5 + 1
       - Output_Start_Col: min_col_5
       - Output_End_Col: max_col_5
    4. Extract the subgrid from the Input using these calculated boundaries.

Relationships:
  - The output grid's content is directly copied from the corresponding subgrid region of the input.
  - The size and position of the output subgrid are determined solely by the distribution of '5' digits in the input.
