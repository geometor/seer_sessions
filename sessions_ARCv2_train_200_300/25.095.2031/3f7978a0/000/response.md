Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are 2D grids (matrices) containing numerical digits. The digits observed are 0, 5, and 8.
2.  **Core Content:** The digits 5 and 8 seem significant, while 0 appears to be a background or empty value.
3.  **Structure Preservation:** The relative arrangement of the non-zero digits within a specific region seems mostly preserved from input to output.
4.  **Dimensionality Change:** The output grid is consistently smaller than the input grid. The transformation involves selecting a specific sub-region of the input.
5.  **Key Identifier:** The digit '5' appears to play a central role in determining the region to be extracted. The output grid seems centered vertically around the rows containing '5's and horizontally aligned with the columns containing '5's.
6.  **Boundary Definition:** The output grid's columns exactly span the columns containing at least one '5'. The output grid's rows span the rows containing '5's, plus one additional row above the topmost '5' row and one additional row below the bottommost '5' row.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation

Input:
  Type: 2D Grid
  Elements:
    - Digit: 0 (Background)
    - Digit: 5 (Key Object Marker)
    - Digit: 8 (Secondary Object/Context)
  Properties:
    - Variable dimensions

Output:
  Type: 2D Grid
  Elements: Digits from Input (0, 5, 8)
  Properties:
    - Smaller dimensions than Input
    - Represents a subgrid of the Input

Transformation:
  Action: Subgrid Extraction / Cropping
  Rule_Basis: Spatial location of '5' digits in the Input grid.
  Process_Steps:
    1. Identify all cells containing the digit '5'.
    2. Determine the bounding box of these '5' cells:
       - min_row_5: Minimum row index containing a '5'.
       - max_row_5: Maximum row index containing a '5'.
       - min_col_5: Minimum column index containing a '5'.
       - max_col_5: Maximum column index containing a '5'.
    3. Define the output grid boundaries based on the '5' bounding box:
       - Output_Start_Row: min_row_5 - 1
       - Output_End_Row: max_row_5 + 1
       - Output_Start_Col: min_col_5
       - Output_End_Col: max_col_5
    4. Extract the subgrid from the Input using these calculated boundaries.

Relationships:
  - The output grid's content is directly copied from the corresponding subgrid region of the input.
  - The size and position of the output subgrid are determined solely by the distribution of '5' digits in the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid to find the row and column indices of all cells containing the digit '5'.
2.  Find the minimum and maximum row index among all '5' cells found (`min_row_5`, `max_row_5`).
3.  Find the minimum and maximum column index among all '5' cells found (`min_col_5`, `max_col_5`).
4.  Determine the row range for the output grid by taking the rows from `min_row_5 - 1` up to and including `max_row_5 + 1`.
5.  Determine the column range for the output grid by taking the columns from `min_col_5` up to and including `max_col_5`.
6.  Create the output grid by extracting the portion of the input grid defined by the calculated row and column ranges.
