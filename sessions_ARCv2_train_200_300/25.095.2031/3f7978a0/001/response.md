Scan the input grid to find the row and column indices of all cells containing the digit '5'.
Find the minimum and maximum row index among all '5' cells found (min_row_5, max_row_5).
Find the minimum and maximum column index among all '5' cells found (min_col_5, max_col_5).
Determine the row range for the output grid by taking the rows from min_row_5 - 1 up to and including max_row_5 + 1.
Determine the column range for the output grid by taking the columns from min_col_5 up to and including max_col_5.
Create the output grid by extracting the portion of the input grid defined by the calculated row and column ranges.
