The output grids contain `0`s, `1`s, and `2`s.\n3.  **Core Object:** There's a discernible shape or pattern formed by the non-zero cells (specifically, the `1`s) within the input grid. The `0`s seem to represent the background.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation modifies some of the `1`s in the input shape into `2`s in the output grid. The `0`s remain unchanged, and the `1`s that are *not* modified also retain their value.\n5.  **Spatial Relationship:** The change from `1` to `2` appears to be based on the vertical position (row index) within the shape formed by the `1`s. Specifically, the `1`s located in the lower half of the shape's vertical extent are changed to `2`s.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all row indices in the input grid that contain at least one cell with the value `1`.\n3.  If no rows contain `1`, the process is complete, and the initial output grid (identical to input) is the result.\n4.  Determine the minimum (`min_row`) and maximum (`max_row`) row indices among those identified in step 2.\n5.  Calculate the vertical height of the shape: `height = max_row - min_row + 1`.\n6.  Calculate the midpoint row index: `midpoint_row = min_row + (height // 2)`.\n7.  Iterate through each cell (`cell`) of the input grid using its `row_index` and `col_index`.\n8.  For each `cell`, check if its value is `1` *and* if its `row_index` is greater than or equal to the calculated `midpoint_row`.\n9.  If both conditions in step 8 are true, update the value of the corresponding cell in the output grid to `2`.\n10. Return the final output grid."
