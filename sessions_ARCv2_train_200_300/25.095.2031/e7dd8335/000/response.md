Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) containing integer values.
2.  **Values:** The input grids primarily contain `0`s and `1`s. The output grids contain `0`s, `1`s, and `2`s.
3.  **Core Object:** There's a discernible shape or pattern formed by the non-zero cells (specifically, the `1`s) within the input grid. The `0`s seem to represent the background.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation modifies some of the `1`s in the input shape into `2`s in the output grid. The `0`s remain unchanged, and the `1`s that are *not* modified also retain their value.
5.  **Spatial Relationship:** The change from `1` to `2` appears to be based on the vertical position (row index) within the shape formed by the `1`s. Specifically, the `1`s located in the lower half of the shape's vertical extent are changed to `2`s.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing the input and output spaces.
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - value: The integer contained in the cell (0, 1 in input; 0, 1, 2 in output).
      - row_index: The vertical position of the cell (0-based).
      - col_index: The horizontal position of the cell (0-based).
  - object: shape
    description: A collection of connected or relevant cells with value 1 in the input grid.
    properties:
      - cells: List of cells belonging to the shape.
      - min_row: The minimum row index occupied by any cell of the shape.
      - max_row: The maximum row index occupied by any cell of the shape.
      - height: The total number of rows spanned by the shape (max_row - min_row + 1).
      - midpoint_row: The calculated row index that divides the shape vertically into upper and lower halves (min_row + height // 2).
actions:
  - action: identify_shape_rows
    description: Find all row indices that contain at least one cell with value 1.
  - action: determine_vertical_bounds
    description: Calculate the minimum and maximum row indices from the identified shape rows.
  - action: calculate_midpoint
    description: Compute the midpoint row index based on the minimum row and the shape's height.
  - action: modify_cell_value
    description: Change the value of specific cells from 1 to 2 based on their row position relative to the midpoint.
relationships:
  - relationship: cell_position
    description: A cell's location within the grid defined by its row and column index.
  - relationship: cell_membership
    description: A cell with value 1 belongs to the shape.
  - relationship: vertical_division
    description: Cells are categorized as being in the upper or lower half of the shape based on their row index compared to the midpoint row. Cells with row_index >= midpoint_row are considered in the lower half.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all row indices in the input grid that contain at least one cell with the value `1`.
3.  If no rows contain `1`, the process is complete, and the initial output grid (identical to input) is the result.
4.  Determine the minimum (`min_row`) and maximum (`max_row`) row indices among those identified in step 2.
5.  Calculate the vertical height of the shape: `height = max_row - min_row + 1`.
6.  Calculate the midpoint row index: `midpoint_row = min_row + (height // 2)`.
7.  Iterate through each cell (`cell`) of the input grid using its `row_index` and `col_index`.
8.  For each `cell`, check if its value is `1` *and* if its `row_index` is greater than or equal to the calculated `midpoint_row`.
9.  If both conditions in step 8 are true, update the value of the corresponding cell in the output grid to `2`.
10. Return the final output grid.
