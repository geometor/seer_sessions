task_elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing the input and output spaces.
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - value: The integer contained in the cell (0, 1 in input; 0, 1, 2 in output).
      - row_index: The vertical position of the cell (0-based).
      - col_index: The horizontal position of the cell (0-based).
  - object: shape
    description: A collection of connected or relevant cells with value 1 in the input grid.
    properties:
      - cells: List of cells belonging to the shape.
      - min_row: The minimum row index occupied by any cell of the shape.
      - max_row: The maximum row index occupied by any cell of the shape.
      - height: The total number of rows spanned by the shape (max_row - min_row + 1).
      - midpoint_row: The calculated row index that divides the shape vertically into upper and lower halves (min_row + height // 2).
actions:
  - action: identify_shape_rows
    description: Find all row indices that contain at least one cell with value 1.
  - action: determine_vertical_bounds
    description: Calculate the minimum and maximum row indices from the identified shape rows.
  - action: calculate_midpoint
    description: Compute the midpoint row index based on the minimum row and the shape's height.
  - action: modify_cell_value
    description: Change the value of specific cells from 1 to 2 based on their row position relative to the midpoint.
relationships:
  - relationship: cell_position
    description: A cell's location within the grid defined by its row and column index.
  - relationship: cell_membership
    description: A cell with value 1 belongs to the shape.
  - relationship: vertical_division
    description: Cells are categorized as being in the upper or lower half of the shape based on their row index compared to the midpoint row. Cells with row_index >= midpoint_row are considered in the lower half.
