## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input/Output:** Both inputs and outputs are 2D grids of numerical digits.
2.  **Grid Cells:** Each cell contains a single digit, likely representing a color or state.
3.  **Background Color:** The digit '8' appears to be the default or background color, filling most of the grid in the inputs.
4.  **Foreground Color:** In each input grid, there is exactly one cell with a color different from '8' (e.g., '4', '9', '6'). This seems to be the significant 'foreground' color/pixel.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the single foreground pixel. Its presence in the input determines the pattern in the output.
6.  **Output Pattern:** The output grids consist of the background color ('8') and a solid 3x3 square filled with the foreground color from the input.
7.  **Pattern Placement:** The position of the 3x3 square in the output grid is related to the position of the single foreground pixel in the input grid. Specifically, the output square occupies the 3x3 block (aligned to a conceptual 3x3 grid tiling) that contains the original foreground pixel.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the background color, which is '8'.
2.  Scan the input grid row by row, then column by column, to find the coordinates `(r, c)` and the color `C` of the single cell that does not contain the background color '8'.
3.  Determine the top-left coordinates `(TL_r, TL_c)` of the 3x3 grid block that contains the cell `(r, c)`. Calculate these coordinates using integer division: `TL_r = (r // 3) * 3` and `TL_c = (c // 3) * 3`.
4.  Create a new output grid with the same height and width as the input grid.
5.  Fill every cell `(i, j)` in the output grid according to the following rule:
    *   If the cell's row `i` is between `TL_r` (inclusive) and `TL_r + 3` (exclusive), AND the cell's column `j` is between `TL_c` (inclusive) and `TL_c + 3` (exclusive), set the cell's color to `C`.
    *   Otherwise, set the cell's color to the background color '8'.
6.  Return the generated output grid.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial analysis correctly identified the core components: input/output grids, background color ('8'), and a single foreground pixel determining the output. However, the transformation rule involving a fixed 3x3 block placed using `(r // 3 * 3, c // 3 * 3)` was incorrect, as evidenced by the mismatches in examples 2, 3, and 4.

The key insight from analyzing the failures is that the output pattern is not a fixed-size block relative to a 3x3 grid, but rather a rectangular region whose boundaries are defined by the location `(r, c)` of the input foreground pixel relative to the grid dimensions. Specifically, the grid is conceptually divided into four quadrants by the grid's midpoint, and the quadrant containing the foreground pixel determines which corresponding data quadrant (defined by the pixel's row `r` and column `c`) is filled in the output.

**Strategy:**
1.  Confirm the revised hypothesis (quadrant-based filling) using code execution to analyze metrics for each example.
2.  Update the YAML facts to describe the grid division, quadrant determination, and quadrant filling process.
3.  Rewrite the natural language program to accurately reflect this revised transformation logic.

## Metrics Analysis

The following metrics were gathered using code execution to test the revised hypothesis:


```json
{
  "Example 1": {
    "Input Dim (H,W)": [6, 8],
    "FG (r,c)": [3, 2],
    "FG Color": 4,
    "Grid Midpoint (mid_r, mid_c)": [3, 4],
    "Pixel Location Quadrant": "Grid-BL",
    "Data Quadrant Rows (start, end)": [3, 6],
    "Data Quadrant Cols (start, end)": [0, 3],
    "Hypothesis Matches Expected Output": true
  },
  "Example 2": {
    "Input Dim (H,W)": [6, 6],
    "FG (r,c)": [2, 4],
    "FG Color": 9,
    "Grid Midpoint (mid_r, mid_c)": [3, 3],
    "Pixel Location Quadrant": "Grid-TR",
    "Data Quadrant Rows (start, end)": [0, 3],
    "Data Quadrant Cols (start, end)": [4, 6],
    "Hypothesis Matches Expected Output": true
  },
  "Example 3": {
    "Input Dim (H,W)": [10, 8],
    "FG (r,c)": [4, 2],
    "FG Color": 6,
    "Grid Midpoint (mid_r, mid_c)": [5, 4],
    "Pixel Location Quadrant": "Grid-TL",
    "Data Quadrant Rows (start, end)": [0, 5],
    "Data Quadrant Cols (start, end)": [0, 3],
    "Hypothesis Matches Expected Output": true
  },
  "Example 4": {
    "Input Dim (H,W)": [4, 4],
    "FG (r,c)": [0, 2],
    "FG Color": 6,
    "Grid Midpoint (mid_r, mid_c)": [2, 2],
    "Pixel Location Quadrant": "Grid-TR",
    "Data Quadrant Rows (start, end)": [0, 1],
    "Data Quadrant Cols (start, end)": [2, 4],
    "Hypothesis Matches Expected Output": true
  }
}
```

The analysis confirms that the hypothesis—determining the grid quadrant of the foreground pixel and filling the corresponding data quadrant—correctly predicts the output for all training examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the background color ('8') and the dimensions (height `H`, width `W`) of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find the coordinates `(r, c)` and the color `C` of the single cell that does not contain the background color.
3.  Calculate the grid's midpoint coordinates: `mid_r = H // 2` and `mid_c = W // 2`.
4.  Determine the location of the foreground pixel relative to the midpoint:
    *   If `r < mid_r` and `c < mid_c`, the pixel is in the Top-Left (TL) grid quadrant.
    *   If `r < mid_r` and `c >= mid_c`, the pixel is in the Top-Right (TR) grid quadrant.
    *   If `r >= mid_r` and `c < mid_c`, the pixel is in the Bottom-Left (BL) grid quadrant.
    *   If `r >= mid_r` and `c >= mid_c`, the pixel is in the Bottom-Right (BR) grid quadrant.
5.  Create a new output grid with the same height `H` and width `W`, initially filled entirely with the background color '8'.
6.  Based on the determined grid quadrant from step 4, fill the corresponding rectangular area in the output grid with the foreground color `C`:
    *   If TL quadrant: Fill cells `(i, j)` where `0 <= i <= r` and `0 <= j <= c`.
    *   If TR quadrant: Fill cells `(i, j)` where `0 <= i <= r` and `c <= j < W`.
    *   If BL quadrant: Fill cells `(i, j)` where `r <= i < H` and `0 <= j <= c`.
    *   If BR quadrant: Fill cells `(i, j)` where `r <= i < H` and `c <= j < W`.
7.  Return the generated output grid.
