task_description: Identify a unique non-background pixel in the input grid and fill the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid with that pixel's color, setting the rest to the background color.

grid_properties:
  cell_content: single digits (representing colors)
  background_color: '8' # Based on consistent observation across examples
  foreground_color: Any digit other than the background color. Only one such digit exists per input grid.

objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array of digits
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array of digits (same dimensions as input)
  - name: background_pixel
    properties:
      color: '8'
  - name: foreground_pixel
    properties:
      color: C (variable, e.g., '4', '9', '6')
      location: (r, c) - row and column index in the input grid
  - name: output_block
    properties:
      size: 3x3
      color: C (same as foreground_pixel)
      location: Top-left corner (TL_r, TL_c) in the output grid

relationships:
  - type: identity
    description: Output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - type: determination
    description: The color and location (r, c) of the single foreground_pixel in the input_grid determine the output_grid content.
  - type: calculation
    description: The top-left corner (TL_r, TL_c) of the output_block is derived from the foreground_pixel's location (r, c).
    formula: TL_r = (r // 3) * 3, TL_c = (c // 3) * 3
  - type: construction
    description: The output_grid is constructed by filling the output_block area with the foreground color C and all other cells with the background_color.

actions:
  - name: find_foreground_pixel
    inputs: input_grid, background_color
    outputs: foreground_color C, location (r, c)
    description: Scan the input grid to locate the single pixel whose color is not the background color.
  - name: calculate_block_location
    inputs: foreground_pixel location (r, c)
    outputs: output_block top-left location (TL_r, TL_c)
    description: Apply integer division and multiplication by 3 to find the containing 3x3 block's origin.
  - name: generate_output_grid
    inputs: grid_dimensions, output_block (location and color), background_color
    outputs: output_grid
    description: Create a grid, fill the 3x3 output_block area with its specified color, and fill the rest with the background color.
