            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core components: input/output grids, background color ('8'), and a single foreground pixel determining the output. However, the transformation rule involving a fixed 3x3 block placed using `(r // 3 * 3, c // 3 * 3)` was incorrect, as evidenced by the mismatches in examples 2, 3, and 4.\n\nThe key insight from analyzing the failures is that the output pattern is not a fixed-size block relative to a 3x3 grid, but rather a rectangular region whose boundaries are defined by the location `(r, c)` of the input foreground pixel relative to the grid dimensions. Specifically, the grid is conceptually divided into four quadrants by the grid's midpoint, and the quadrant containing the foreground pixel determines which corresponding data quadrant (defined by the pixel's row `r` and column `c`) is filled in the output.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Confirm the revised hypothesis (quadrant-based filling) using code execution to analyze metrics for each example.\n2.  Update the YAML facts to describe the grid division, quadrant determination, and quadrant filling process.\n3.  Rewrite the natural language program to accurately reflect this revised transformation logic.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nThe following metrics were gathered using code execution to test the revised hypothesis:\n\n"
