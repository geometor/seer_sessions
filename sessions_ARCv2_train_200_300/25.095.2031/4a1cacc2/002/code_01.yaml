task_description: Identify the unique non-background pixel in the input grid. Determine its location relative to the grid's center. Fill the corresponding rectangular quadrant defined by the pixel's coordinates in the output grid with the pixel's color, setting the rest to the background color.

grid_properties:
  cell_content: single digits (representing colors)
  background_color: '8'
  foreground_color: Any digit other than the background color. Exactly one per input grid.
  height: H
  width: W

objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array of digits (size HxW)
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array of digits (size HxW)
  - name: background_pixel
    properties:
      color: '8'
  - name: foreground_pixel
    properties:
      color: C (variable, e.g., '4', '9', '6')
      location: (r, c) - row and column index in the input grid
  - name: grid_center
    properties:
      row_midpoint: mid_r = H // 2
      col_midpoint: mid_c = W // 2
  - name: grid_quadrant # Location of FG pixel relative to grid center
    type: enum(TL, TR, BL, BR)
    determination: Based on comparing (r, c) with (mid_r, mid_c)
  - name: output_rectangle # The area to be filled in the output
    properties:
      color: C (same as foreground_pixel)
      rows: defined by grid_quadrant and r (e.g., 0 to r, or r to H-1)
      cols: defined by grid_quadrant and c (e.g., 0 to c, or c to W-1)

relationships:
  - type: identity
    description: Output grid has the same dimensions (H, W) as the input grid.
  - type: determination
    description: The color C and location (r, c) of the single foreground_pixel, along with grid dimensions H and W, determine the output_grid content.
  - type: calculation
    description: Grid midpoint (mid_r, mid_c) is calculated from H and W using integer division.
  - type: classification
    description: The grid_quadrant containing the foreground_pixel is determined by comparing r to mid_r and c to mid_c.
  - type: mapping
    description: The determined grid_quadrant dictates which data quadrant (output_rectangle) to fill.
      - Grid-TL -> Fill rows 0..r, cols 0..c
      - Grid-TR -> Fill rows 0..r, cols c..W-1
      - Grid-BL -> Fill rows r..H-1, cols 0..c
      - Grid-BR -> Fill rows r..H-1, cols c..W-1
  - type: construction
    description: The output_grid is constructed by filling the output_rectangle area with the foreground color C and all other cells with the background_color '8'.
