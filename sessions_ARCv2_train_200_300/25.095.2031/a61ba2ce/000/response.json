Most cells are 0 (background).\n    *   There are four distinct non-zero integers (colors) present in the input grid.\n    *   Each non-zero integer forms a small connected shape composed of exactly three cells.\n    *   These shapes resemble \"L\" shapes, fitting within a 2x2 bounding box. There are four possible orientations for these L-shapes (top-left corner missing, top-right missing, bottom-left missing, bottom-right missing).\n    *   The output is a 4x4 grid.\n    *   The output grid is composed of four 2x2 subgrids, arranged in a 2x2 layout.\n    *   Each 2x2 subgrid in the output corresponds to one of the L-shapes found in the input.\n    *   The specific 2x2 pattern placed in the output subgrid matches the 2x2 bounding box pattern of the corresponding input L-shape (including the single 0 cell).\n    *   The position of each 2x2 pattern within the 4x4 output grid (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right quadrant) is determined solely by the *orientation* of the L-shape it represents, not its color or its location in the input grid.\n\n*   **YAML Fact Document:**\n    "
