objects:
  - name: Grid
    properties:
      - rows: 3
      - columns: variable (consistent within a pair)
      - cells: list of Cell objects
  - name: Cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0 or 4 in input; 0, 4, or 6 in output)
      - row_index: integer (0 to 2)
      - column_index: integer (0 to N-1, where N is the number of columns)

actions:
  - name: Transform Cell Value
    input: Cell from input Grid
    output: Cell for output Grid
    condition:
      - If input Cell.value is 4 AND input Cell.column_index is divisible by 3 (column_index % 3 == 0), then output Cell.value is 6.
      - Otherwise, output Cell.value is the same as input Cell.value.

relationships:
  - The output Grid has the same dimensions (rows and columns) as the input Grid.
  - Each Cell in the output Grid corresponds positionally to a Cell in the input Grid.
  - The value of an output Cell is determined by the value and column_index of the corresponding input Cell according to the Transform Cell Value action.
