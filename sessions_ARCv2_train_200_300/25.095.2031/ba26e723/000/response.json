The number of columns varies between examples but remains consistent within each input-output pair.\n3.  **Value Domain:** Input grids contain only the integers 0 and 4. Output grids contain the integers 0, 4, and 6.\n4.  **Transformation Nature:** The transformation modifies some, but not all, instances of the number 4 in the input grid to the number 6 in the output grid. The number 0 remains unchanged. The positions of the 4s that are changed to 6s seem dependent on their column index.\n5.  **Pattern Recognition:** Upon inspection, a consistent pattern emerges: a '4' in the input grid is changed to a '6' in the output grid if and only if its column index is a multiple of 3 (i.e., column index 0, 3, 6, 9, etc.). This rule applies regardless of the row the '4' is in. All other '4's and all '0's retain their original values.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Check if the value `v` is equal to 4 AND the column index `c` is exactly divisible by 3.\n5.

Otherwise (if the value is not 4, or the column index is not divisible by 3), set the value of the corresponding cell `(r, c)` in the output grid to the original value `v`.\n7.  After iterating through all cells, return the completed output grid."
