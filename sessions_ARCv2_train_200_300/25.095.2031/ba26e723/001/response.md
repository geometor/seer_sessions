import copy

"""
Transforms an input grid by changing the value of cells containing '4' to '6' 
if their column index is a multiple of 3. All other cell values (0s and 4s 
in columns not divisible by 3) remain unchanged. The output grid retains the 
same dimensions as the input grid.

    Applies a transformation rule to a grid of integers.
