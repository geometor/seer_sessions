## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are grids (represented as lists of lists or arrays) containing single-digit integers.
2.  **Grid Dimensions:** All examples have grids with 3 rows. The number of columns varies between examples but remains consistent within each input-output pair.
3.  **Value Domain:** Input grids contain only the integers 0 and 4. Output grids contain the integers 0, 4, and 6.
4.  **Transformation Nature:** The transformation modifies some, but not all, instances of the number 4 in the input grid to the number 6 in the output grid. The number 0 remains unchanged. The positions of the 4s that are changed to 6s seem dependent on their column index.
5.  **Pattern Recognition:** Upon inspection, a consistent pattern emerges: a '4' in the input grid is changed to a '6' in the output grid if and only if its column index is a multiple of 3 (i.e., column index 0, 3, 6, 9, etc.). This rule applies regardless of the row the '4' is in. All other '4's and all '0's retain their original values.

## Facts


```yaml
objects:
  - name: Grid
    properties:
      - rows: 3
      - columns: variable (consistent within a pair)
      - cells: list of Cell objects
  - name: Cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0 or 4 in input; 0, 4, or 6 in output)
      - row_index: integer (0 to 2)
      - column_index: integer (0 to N-1, where N is the number of columns)

actions:
  - name: Transform Cell Value
    input: Cell from input Grid
    output: Cell for output Grid
    condition:
      - If input Cell.value is 4 AND input Cell.column_index is divisible by 3 (column_index % 3 == 0), then output Cell.value is 6.
      - Otherwise, output Cell.value is the same as input Cell.value.

relationships:
  - The output Grid has the same dimensions (rows and columns) as the input Grid.
  - Each Cell in the output Grid corresponds positionally to a Cell in the input Grid.
  - The value of an output Cell is determined by the value and column_index of the corresponding input Cell according to the Transform Cell Value action.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid, using its row index `r` and column index `c`.
3.  Get the value `v` of the input cell at `(r, c)`.
4.  Check if the value `v` is equal to 4 AND the column index `c` is exactly divisible by 3.
5.  If both conditions in step 4 are true, set the value of the corresponding cell `(r, c)` in the output grid to 6.
6.  Otherwise (if the value is not 4, or the column index is not divisible by 3), set the value of the corresponding cell `(r, c)` in the output grid to the original value `v`.
7.  After iterating through all cells, return the completed output grid.
