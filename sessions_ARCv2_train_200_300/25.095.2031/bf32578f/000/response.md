Okay, let's break down the transformation logic based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids of integers. The primary value seems to be 0 (representing background), with one other non-zero integer present in the input (e.g., 8, 7, 6), which acts as the 'color'.
2.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation identifies the non-zero elements in the input grid and uses their positions to define a rectangular area in the output grid. This output rectangle is then filled with the same non-zero 'color' found in the input.
3.  **Bounding Box:** The key first step appears to be finding the minimal bounding box that encloses all non-zero cells in the input grid. Let's denote its corners as (min_row, min_col) and (max_row, max_col).
4.  **Output Rectangle Calculation:** The output rectangle's boundaries seem derived from the input bounding box, but with modifications:
    *   The top row of the output rectangle is one row below the top of the input bounding box (`min_row + 1`).
    *   The bottom row of the output rectangle is one row above the bottom of the input bounding box (`max_row - 1`).
    *   The leftmost column of the output rectangle is one column to the right of the left edge of the input bounding box (`min_col + 1`).
    *   The rightmost column of the output rectangle seems more complex. It depends on the original rightmost column (`max_c`) and the *width* of the input bounding box (`width = max_c - min_c + 1`). The relationship observed across examples is `output_max_col = max_c + (5 - width)`.
5.  **Filling:** The calculated rectangular area in the output grid is filled entirely with the non-zero 'color' identified from the input. All other cells in the output grid are set to 0.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling all cells with 0.
2.  Scan the input grid to find all cells containing a non-zero value.
3.  If no non-zero cells are found, return the initialized (all zeros) output grid.
4.  Identify the specific non-zero value (the `color`).
5.  Determine the minimum and maximum row indices (`min_r`, `max_r`) and minimum and maximum column indices (`min_c`, `max_c`) among all identified non-zero cells. This defines the input `bounding_box`.
6.  Calculate the width of the input `bounding_box`: `width = max_c - min_c + 1`.
7.  Calculate a column adjustment factor `k` based on the width: `k = 5 - width`.
8.  Define the boundaries for the `output_rectangle` to be filled in the output grid:
    *   `out_min_r = min_r + 1`
    *   `out_max_r = max_r - 1`
    *   `out_min_c = min_c + 1`
    *   `out_max_c = max_c + k`
9.  Iterate through all cells in the output grid whose coordinates `(r, c)` satisfy `out_min_r <= r <= out_max_r` and `out_min_c <= c <= out_max_c`.
10. Set the value of these cells to the identified non-zero `color`.
11. Return the final output grid.
