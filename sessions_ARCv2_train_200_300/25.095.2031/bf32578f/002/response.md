## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial `transform` function, based primarily on the first example, correctly identified the core concept of finding a bounding box for non-zero elements and filling a modified rectangle in the output. However, the specific rule used to calculate the right boundary (`out_max_c`) of the output rectangle (`out_max_c = max_c + (5 - width)`) proved too specific and failed on Examples 2 and 3.

The errors indicate that the relationship between the input bounding box width and the output rectangle's right boundary is more nuanced. The strategy is to re-analyze the relationship between the input bounding box parameters (coordinates, dimensions) and the non-zero point count, and the desired output rectangle coordinates across all three examples to find a more general rule.

Analysis revealed that the row calculations (`out_min_r = min_r + 1`, `out_max_r = max_r - 1`) and the left column calculation (`out_min_c = min_c + 1`) hold true for all examples. The discrepancy lies entirely in determining `out_max_c`. A revised hypothesis suggests that `out_max_c` depends on the input `max_c`, the input bounding box `width`, and the *number of non-zero points* (`N`) in the input. Specifically, a base offset `k_base = 4 - width` is calculated, and this offset is increased if the number of non-zero points exceeds a threshold (found to be 6).

## Metrics and Verification

Let's verify the key parameters for each example.
