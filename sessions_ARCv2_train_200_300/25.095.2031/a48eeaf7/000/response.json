Find the cell `(target_row, target_col)` within the 2x2 block of '2's that has the minimum Manhattan distance (`|target_row - curr_row| + |target_col - curr_col|`) from the current position `(curr_row, curr_col)`. If there are multiple such cells, any one can be chosen.\n            ii. Calculate the step direction towards the chosen target cell: `step_row = sign(target_row - curr_row)` and `step_col = sign(target_col - curr_col)`, where `sign(x)` is -1 if x < 0, 1 if x > 0, and 0 if x = 0.\n            iii. Determine the next potential position: `next_row = curr_row + step_row`, `next_col = curr_col + step_col`.\n            iv. Check if the cell at `(next_row, next_col)` in the *input* grid contains the value 2.\n            v.  If `(next_row, next_col)` contains a 2, the movement for this '5' stops. The final position is the *current* position `(curr_row, curr_col)`. Exit the movement loop for this '5'.\n            vi. If `(next_row, next_col)` does not contain a 2, update the current position: `curr_row = next_row`, `curr_col = next_col`. Continue the movement loop from step 4.b.i.\n        c.  Once the loop terminates, place the value 5 at the determined final position `(curr_row, curr_col)` in the output grid.\n    5.  Return the completed output grid."
