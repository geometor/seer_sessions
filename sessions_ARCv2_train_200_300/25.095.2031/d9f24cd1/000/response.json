The key transformation involves identifying the columns where a '2' exists in the last row of the input. These columns are then filled entirely with '2's in the output grid.\n    *   However, the original positions of the '5's from the input grid are preserved in the output grid. If a '5' was located in a column designated to be filled with '2's, the '5' takes precedence and appears in that cell in the output instead of a '2'.\n    *   All other cells (those not containing an original '5' and not in a column marked by a '2' in the input's last row) remain '0'.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
