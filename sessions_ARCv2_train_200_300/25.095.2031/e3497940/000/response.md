Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are grids (2D arrays) containing single digits.
2.  **Grid Dimensions:**
    *   The input grids are consistently 10 rows by 9 columns.
    *   The output grids are consistently 10 rows by 4 columns.
3.  **Separator Column:** In all input examples, the 5th column (index 4) consists entirely of the digit '5'. This column appears to act as a separator or central axis and is not directly present in the output.
4.  **Input Structure:** The input grid can be conceptually divided into three parts based on the separator column:
    *   Left Part: Columns 0, 1, 2, 3 (4 columns)
    *   Separator: Column 4
    *   Right Part: Columns 5, 6, 7, 8 (4 columns)
5.  **Output Origin:** The output grid's dimensions (10x4) match the dimensions of the left part of the input grid. This suggests the output is primarily derived from the input's left part.
6.  **Transformation Pattern:** Comparing the input's left part and the output row by row reveals a pattern:
    *   If a cell in the input's left part is non-zero, its value appears in the corresponding cell of the output.
    *   If a cell in the input's left part is zero (0), the corresponding cell in the output takes its value from the input's *right* part. The specific cell in the right part seems to be determined by a horizontal reflection or mirroring across the central separator column. For an input cell at `(r, c)` (where `c < 4`), if it's 0, the output value seems to come from `input[r][8-c]`.

**YAML Facts:**

      left_value = input_grid[row_index][col_index]
      if left_value is not 0:
        return left_value
      else:
        mirrored_col_index = 8 - col_index
        right_mirrored_value = input_grid[row_index][mirrored_col_index]
        return right_mirrored_value
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same number of rows as the input grid (10) and 4 columns.
2.  Iterate through each row (`r`) from 0 to 9 of the input grid.
3.  For each row `r`, iterate through each column (`c`) from 0 to 3 (representing the columns of the output grid and the left part of the input grid).
4.  Retrieve the value from the input grid at position (`r`, `c`). Let this be `left_value`.
5.  Check if `left_value` is equal to 0.
    *   If `left_value` is **not** 0: Set the value of the output grid at position (`r`, `c`) to `left_value`.
    *   If `left_value` **is** 0:
        a. Calculate the mirrored column index in the right part of the input grid using the formula: `mirrored_col = 8 - c`.
        b. Retrieve the value from the input grid at position (`r`, `mirrored_col`). Let this be `right_mirrored_value`.
        c. Set the value of the output grid at position (`r`, `c`) to `right_mirrored_value`.
6.  After iterating through all rows and columns, the populated output grid is the result.
