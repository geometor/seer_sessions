            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial hypothesis, based on the first example, was that the transformation involved finding a connected component of non-zero digits whose bounding box was \"solid\" (contained no zeros). The provided code implemented this logic.\n\nHowever, testing against the full training set revealed this hypothesis was insufficient. Example 1 failed because there were *multiple* components with solid bounding boxes in the input. The code selected the first one it encountered, which was incorrect. Examples 2 and 3 passed because, presumably, the first solid bounding box found was the correct one, or there was only one solid bounding box.\n\nThe failure in Example 1 necessitates refining the selection criteria for the target component. Comparing the component selected by the code in Example 1 versus the component corresponding to the expected output suggests a new key property: the target component must **perfectly fill** its minimal bounding box. This means the number of cells belonging to the component must equal the area (width * height) of its bounding box. This implicitly ensures the bounding box is \"solid\" (contains no zeros), but adds the crucial constraint that eliminates components like Component A in Example 1, whose bounding box includes non-zero digits from *other* components or empty spaces that are not part of the component itself but fall within its rectangular bounds.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Verify this \"perfectly filled\" hypothesis by calculating metrics for the components in Example 1.\n2.  Update the description of the target object and the transformation steps to reflect this refined understanding.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze the components and their properties for Example 1 to confirm the hypothesis.\n\n**Input Example 1:**\n"

Both Component A (incorrect output) *and* Component C (correct output) **perfectly fill** their respective bounding boxes.\n\n*   Component A: Bbox (0,0) to (4,3), Area = 5 * 4 = 20. Cell count = 20. Perfectly filled = True.\n*   Component C: Bbox (7,1) to (9,3), Area = 3 * 3 = 9. Cell count = 9. Perfectly filled = True.\n\nThis means the \"perfectly filled\" criterion alone is *also* insufficient to distinguish the correct component in Example 1. The code still picked Component A because it was likely encountered first in the iteration.\n\n**Revised Hypothesis / Strategy:**\n\nSince both components perfectly fill their bounding boxes, there must be another distinguishing feature. Let's re-examine the components and the task:\n\n*   Component A (Incorrect): Size 5x4=20 cells.\n*   Component C (Correct): Size 3x3=9 cells.\n\nIn Example 1, the correct component is significantly *smaller* (in terms of bounding box area and cell count) than the incorrect one.\n\nLet's check if selecting the *smallest* component that perfectly fills its bounding box works for all examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Component C (9 cells) is smaller than Component A (20 cells). Component B is neither solid nor perfectly filled. Selecting the smallest perfectly filled component (C) yields the correct output.\n*   **Example 2:** Only one component perfectly fills its bounding box (verified by code output). Selecting the smallest (which is the only one) works.\n*   **Example 3:** Only one component perfectly fills its bounding box (verified by code output). Selecting the smallest (the only one) works.\n\n**New Strategy:** The transformation involves finding *all* connected components that perfectly fill their bounding box, and then selecting the one with the **smallest bounding box area**. If there's a tie in area, perhaps cell count or another tie-breaker is needed, but based on the examples, minimum area seems sufficient.\n\n## Updated Facts\n\n"
