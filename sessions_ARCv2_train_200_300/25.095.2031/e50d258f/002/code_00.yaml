Data:
  - type: Grid
    description: Represents the input and output structures.
    properties:
      rows: Integer (Input is 10, Output varies)
      columns: Integer (Input is 10, Output varies)
      cells: List of Lists of Integers (containing 0, 1, 2, 8)

Digits:
  - type: BackgroundDigit
    value: 0
    description: Represents empty space, separating foreground objects.
  - type: ForegroundDigit
    value: [1, 2, 8]
    description: Represents the content of objects or patterns.

Objects:
  - type: ConnectedComponent
    description: A cluster of adjacent (horizontally or vertically) ForegroundDigits.
    properties:
      cells: List of (row, col) tuples containing ForegroundDigits belonging to the component.
      bounding_box: The minimal rectangle enclosing all cells of the component.
        properties:
          min_row: Integer
          max_row: Integer
          min_col: Integer
          max_col: Integer
      bbox_area: Integer (Calculated as (max_row - min_row + 1) * (max_col - min_col + 1))
      cell_count: Integer (Calculated as the number of cells in the component)
      is_perfectly_filled: Boolean (Derived property - True if bbox_area == cell_count, False otherwise)

Transformation:
  - action: IdentifyComponents
    description: Find all distinct ConnectedComponents of ForegroundDigits in the input grid.
  - action: CalculateProperties
    description: For each component, determine its bounding_box, bbox_area, and cell_count.
  - action: IdentifyPerfectlyFilled
    description: Filter the components to find only those where is_perfectly_filled is True.
  - action: SelectSmallestComponent
    description: From the perfectly filled components, select the one with the minimum bbox_area. (Assume a unique minimum exists based on examples).
  - action: ExtractSubgrid
    description: Create the output grid by copying the portion of the input grid defined by the selected component's bounding box.
