The digits '1', '2', and '8' form distinct clusters or shapes within the grid, separated by the '0' digits.\n\nThe output is a smaller rectangular grid containing only the digits '1', '2', and '8'. The '0' digits are absent in the output. The dimensions of the output grid vary between examples.\n\nThe core transformation seems to involve identifying a specific cluster of non-zero digits in the input grid and extracting the minimal rectangular region (bounding box) that encompasses this cluster. Based on the examples, the selected cluster is the one whose bounding box contains *only* non-zero digits from the input grid (no '0's fall within the selected bounding box).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Treat the digit 0 as empty space separating components.\n2.  **Determine Bounding Boxes:** For each identified component, calculate its minimal bounding box by finding the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by the digits within that component.\n3.  **Find Solid Bounding Box:** Examine each component's bounding box. Check if the rectangular subgrid defined by this bounding box in the original input grid contains *only* non-zero digits (i.e., it contains no 0s).\n4.  **Select Target Component:** Select the component whose bounding box was identified as solid in the previous step. (Based on the examples, it's assumed there will be exactly one such component).\n5.  **Extract Output:** The output grid is the rectangular subgrid from the input grid corresponding exactly to the bounding box of the selected solid component."
