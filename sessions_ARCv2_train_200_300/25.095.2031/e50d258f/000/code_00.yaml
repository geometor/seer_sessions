Data:
  - type: Grid
    description: Represents the input and output structures.
    properties:
      rows: Integer (Input is 10, Output varies)
      columns: Integer (Input is 10, Output varies)
      cells: List of Lists of Integers

Digits:
  - type: BackgroundDigit
    value: 0
    description: Represents empty space, separating foreground objects.
  - type: ForegroundDigit
    value: [1, 2, 8]
    description: Represents the content of objects or patterns.

Objects:
  - type: ConnectedComponent
    description: A cluster of adjacent (horizontally or vertically) ForegroundDigits. Input grids may contain multiple components.
    properties:
      cells: List of coordinates containing ForegroundDigits belonging to the component.
      bounding_box: The minimal rectangle enclosing all cells of the component.
        properties:
          min_row: Integer
          max_row: Integer
          min_col: Integer
          max_col: Integer
      is_solid: Boolean (Derived property - True if the bounding box in the input grid contains only ForegroundDigits, False otherwise)

Transformation:
  - action: IdentifyComponents
    description: Find all distinct ConnectedComponents of ForegroundDigits in the input grid.
  - action: CalculateBoundingBoxes
    description: Determine the minimal bounding box for each identified component.
  - action: CheckSolidity
    description: For each component's bounding box, check if all cells within that box in the *input* grid contain ForegroundDigits.
  - action: SelectComponent
    description: Choose the single component whose bounding box is solid (contains no BackgroundDigits).
    assumption: Exactly one such component exists in each input.
  - action: ExtractSubgrid
    description: Create the output grid by copying the portion of the input grid defined by the selected component's bounding box.
