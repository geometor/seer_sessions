Data:
  - type: Grid
    description: Represents the input and output structures.
    properties:
      rows: Integer (Input is 10, Output varies)
      columns: Integer (Input is 10, Output varies)
      cells: List of Lists of Integers (0, 1, 2, 8)

Digits:
  - type: BackgroundDigit
    value: 0
    description: Represents empty space.
  - type: ForegroundDigit
    value: [1, 2, 8]
    description: Represents the content of objects.

Objects:
  - type: SolidRectangleComponent
    description: >
      A connected component of ForegroundDigits that perfectly
      fills its minimal bounding box within the input grid.
      Essentially, a rectangular block composed entirely of
      non-zero digits.
    properties:
      cells: List of coordinates (row, col) belonging to the component.
      bounding_box: The minimal rectangle enclosing the component.
        properties:
          min_row: Integer
          max_row: Integer
          min_col: Integer
          max_col: Integer
      area: Integer (Calculated from bounding_box dimensions)
      cell_count: Integer (Number of cells in the component; must equal area)
      touches_grid_edge: Boolean (True if the bounding_box touches row 0, col 0, row 9, or col 9 of the input grid)
      top_left_corner: Tuple (min_row, min_col)

Transformation:
  - action: IdentifySolidRectangles
    description: Find all distinct SolidRectangleComponents in the input grid.
  - action: FilterByEdgeContact
    description: Create a candidate list containing only those SolidRectangleComponents where touches_grid_edge is True.
  - action: SelectTargetComponent
    description: >
      From the candidate list, select the component based on the following
      prioritized criteria:
      1. Minimum area.
      2. Minimum top_left_corner row index (if tie in area).
      3. Minimum top_left_corner column index (if tie in row index).
    assumption: Exactly one component will satisfy the criteria.
  - action: ExtractSubgrid
    description: >
      Create the output grid by copying the portion of the input grid
      defined by the selected component's bounding_box.
