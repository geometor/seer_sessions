## General Assessment

The initial code successfully identified and extracted "solid" rectangular components (where the component's non-zero cells perfectly fill its bounding box). It correctly solved Examples 1 and 3 but failed on Example 2.

The failure occurred because the selection criterion ("smallest area") was incorrect. Example 2 requires selecting a component (Area 20) that is neither the smallest (Area 16) nor the largest (Area 24) among the solid rectangular components.

The new strategy involves adding a filtering step: only consider solid rectangular components that touch at least one edge of the 10x10 input grid. After filtering, the selection criterion remains finding the component with the minimum area, using top-most, then left-most as tie-breakers. This revised strategy appears consistent with all three training examples.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's verify the properties of the solid rectangular components (which are also the maximal solid rectangles in these examples) for each training case.

**Definitions:**
*   **Component:** A set of connected non-zero cells found via BFS.
*   **BBox:** Minimal bounding box (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c).
*   **Solid:** The component perfectly fills its bounding box (number of cells == bbox_area). All examples here have components that are solid rectangles.
*   **Touches Edge:** True if min_r=0, min_c=0, max_r=9, or max_c=9 (assuming 10x10 grid, 0-indexed).
*   **Area:** (max_r - min_r + 1) * (max_c - min_c + 1)

**Analysis of Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:** Solid components have areas 20, 35, 9. *Correction:* My manual analysis missed a cell, the first component is 5x4=20, not 4x4=16. All touch the edge. Applying the new rule: Filter -> [Area 20, Area 35, Area 9]. Select min area -> Area 9. Target BBox: (7,1)-(9,3). **Matches expectation.**
*   **Example 2:** Solid components have areas 20, 16, 24. Filter (Touches Edge): Keep Area 20 (True), discard Area 16 (False), keep Area 24 (True). Filtered list: [Area 20, Area 24]. Select min area -> Area 20. Target BBox: (0,6)-(4,9). **Matches expectation.**
*   **Example 3:** Solid components have areas 24, 24. Filter (Touches Edge): Keep Area 24 (True), Keep Area 24 (True). Filtered list: [Area 24 (0,0), Area 24 (3,6)]. Select min area -> Tie (24). Tie-breaker (min row) -> (0,0) wins over (3,6). Target BBox: (0,0)-(5,3). **Matches expectation.**

The metrics confirm the refined hypothesis works for all training examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Solid Rectangular Components:** Scan the 10x10 input grid to find all distinct connected components formed by adjacent non-zero digits (1, 2, 8). For each component, determine its minimal bounding box. Identify components that are "solid rectangles," meaning their non-zero cells exactly fill their bounding box (component cell count equals bounding box area).
2.  **Filter by Edge Contact:** Examine each identified solid rectangular component. Create a candidate list containing only those components whose bounding box touches any of the four outer edges (top, bottom, left, or right) of the 10x10 input grid.
3.  **Select the Target Component:** From the candidate list, select the single target component using the following rules, in order:
    *   Choose the component with the smallest bounding box area.
    *   If multiple components share the smallest area, choose the one whose top-left corner has the smallest row index (i.e., the highest one).
    *   If multiple components are still tied, choose the one whose top-left corner has the smallest column index (i.e., the leftmost one).
4.  **Extract Output:** Create the output grid by extracting the subgrid from the input grid that corresponds exactly to the bounding box of the selected target component.
