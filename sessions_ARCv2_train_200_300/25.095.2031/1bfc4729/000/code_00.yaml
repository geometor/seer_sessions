task_description: "Transform a 10x10 grid based on the locations and values of two non-zero numbers."
grid_properties:
  size: [10, 10]
  background_value: 0
input_elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - contains: two non-zero values (C1, C2) at locations (R1, Col1) and (R2, Col2) respectively, where R1 < R2.
      - contains: zero values elsewhere.
output_elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - size: [10, 10]
      - divided_horizontally: True
        boundary_definition: "Based on the row R1 of the upper non-zero value C1."
        regions:
          - region: top
            rows: [0, R1 + 2]
            color: C1
            pattern:
              - type: filled_row
                condition: "row index is R1 or R1-2"
              - type: border_row
                condition: "otherwise"
                details: "Set column 0 and 9 to C1, others to 0."
          - region: bottom
            rows: [R1 + 3, 9]
            color: C2
            pattern:
              - type: filled_row
                condition: "row index is R2 or R2+2"
              - type: border_row
                condition: "otherwise"
                details: "Set column 0 and 9 to C2, others to 0."
relationships:
  - type: mapping
    input: non-zero value C1 at (R1, Col1)
    output: determines color and pattern for rows 0 to R1+2
  - type: mapping
    input: non-zero value C2 at (R2, Col2)
    output: determines color and pattern for rows R1+3 to 9
assumptions:
  - R1 >= 2
  - R2 <= 7 (Based on observed examples, specific row indices R1-2 and R2+2 are filled)
