The grid appears visually divided into two horizontal sections.\n3.  **Non-Zero Values:** The two non-zero values from the input grid determine the colors used in the output grid and influence the pattern structure. Let's call the value with the smaller row index C1 (at row R1) and the value with the larger row index C2 (at row R2).\n4.  **Horizontal Division:** The output grid is divided into two regions based on the row index R1 of the upper non-zero value (C1).\n    *   The **Top Region** spans rows 0 to R1 + 2 (inclusive).\n    *   The **Bottom Region** spans rows R1 + 3 to 9 (inclusive).\n5.  **Pattern Application:** A specific pattern is applied within each region, using the corresponding color (C1 for the top, C2 for the bottom).\n    *   **Filled Rows:** Certain rows within each region are completely filled with the region's color.\n        *   In the Top Region: Rows R1 and R1-2 are filled with C1.\n        *   In the Bottom Region: Rows R2 and R2+2 are filled with C2.\n    *   **Border Rows:** All other rows within a region have only their first (column 0) and last (column 9) cells set to the region's color, with the interior cells remaining zero.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
