Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** A 10x10 grid containing mostly zeros (0) and exactly two non-zero integer values at distinct locations.
2.  **Output Grid:** A 10x10 grid derived from the input. The grid appears visually divided into two horizontal sections.
3.  **Non-Zero Values:** The two non-zero values from the input grid determine the colors used in the output grid and influence the pattern structure. Let's call the value with the smaller row index C1 (at row R1) and the value with the larger row index C2 (at row R2).
4.  **Horizontal Division:** The output grid is divided into two regions based on the row index R1 of the upper non-zero value (C1).
    *   The **Top Region** spans rows 0 to R1 + 2 (inclusive).
    *   The **Bottom Region** spans rows R1 + 3 to 9 (inclusive).
5.  **Pattern Application:** A specific pattern is applied within each region, using the corresponding color (C1 for the top, C2 for the bottom).
    *   **Filled Rows:** Certain rows within each region are completely filled with the region's color.
        *   In the Top Region: Rows R1 and R1-2 are filled with C1.
        *   In the Bottom Region: Rows R2 and R2+2 are filled with C2.
    *   **Border Rows:** All other rows within a region have only their first (column 0) and last (column 9) cells set to the region's color, with the interior cells remaining zero.

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    input: non-zero value C1 at (R1, Col1)
    output: determines color and pattern for rows 0 to R1+2
  - type: mapping
    input: non-zero value C2 at (R2, Col2)
    output: determines color and pattern for rows R1+3 to 9
assumptions:
  - R1 >= 2
  - R2 <= 7 (Based on observed examples, specific row indices R1-2 and R2+2 are filled)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the two non-zero cells in the 10x10 input grid. Let the cell with the smaller row index have value `C1` and row index `R1`. Let the cell with the larger row index have value `C2` and row index `R2`.
2.  Create a new 10x10 output grid, initially filled with zeros.
3.  Define the top region as rows 0 through `R1 + 2`.
4.  Define the bottom region as rows `R1 + 3` through 9.
5.  Process the top region (rows `r` from 0 to `R1 + 2`):
    *   If the current row `r` is equal to `R1` or `R1 - 2`, fill the entire row `r` of the output grid with the value `C1`.
    *   Otherwise (for other rows in the top region), set the cell at `(r, 0)` and the cell at `(r, 9)` of the output grid to the value `C1`.
6.  Process the bottom region (rows `r` from `R1 + 3` to 9):
    *   If the current row `r` is equal to `R2` or `R2 + 2`, fill the entire row `r` of the output grid with the value `C2`.
    *   Otherwise (for other rows in the bottom region), set the cell at `(r, 0)` and the cell at `(r, 9)` of the output grid to the value `C2`.
7.  Return the completed output grid.
