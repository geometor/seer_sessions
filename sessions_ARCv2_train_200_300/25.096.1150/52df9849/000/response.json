The input grids contain simple geometric shapes (rectangles, lines) drawn with distinct digits (colors) on a uniform background digit (color 7). Where these shapes overlap or intersect, a color change occurs in the output grid. Specifically, the color of a cell at the intersection point is flipped to the color of the *other* shape involved in the intersection.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
