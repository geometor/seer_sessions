            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input/Output Data:** Both input and output are grids (matrices) of numbers, specifically appearing as 16x16 grids.\n*   **Grid Cells:** Each cell contains a single digit number (0-8).\n*   **Background:** The digit '8' appears to function as a background color, filling most of the grid.\n*   **Foreground Objects:** There are distinct patterns or shapes embedded within the grid, formed by digits other than '8'.\n    *   In `train_1`, the pattern uses digits '0' and '5'.\n    *   In `train_2`, the pattern uses digits '1' and '2'.\n*   **Transformation:** The primary transformation involves the foreground pattern. It appears to be reflected horizontally and undergo a change in its constituent digits (colors). The background '8's remain unchanged in their positions relative to the grid boundaries.\n*   **Coordinate System:** Assuming a standard matrix indexing (row, column), starting from (0, 0) at the top-left.\n*   **Spatial Change:** Comparing the input and output patterns, the row indices seem to remain the same for corresponding parts of the pattern, while the column indices change. Specifically, comparing the columns in both examples suggests a reflection across a vertical axis. For a 16-column grid (indices 0-15), a reflection mapping `c` to `11-c` seems consistent with the observed position shifts in both examples.\n*   **Value Change:** The digits within the pattern also change.\n    *   In `train_1`: Input '5's consistently become '0's in the output. Input '0's sometimes become '0's and sometimes '5's in the output. The change for '0' appears dependent on the *target* column index (`c_out = 11-c`): if `c_out >= 8`, the output is '0'; if `c_out < 8`, the output is '5'.\n    *   In `train_2`: Input '1's become '2's, and input '2's become '1's. This is a simple swap.\n*   **Rule Dependency:** The specific rule for changing the values depends on the pair of non-background digits present in the input pattern.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
