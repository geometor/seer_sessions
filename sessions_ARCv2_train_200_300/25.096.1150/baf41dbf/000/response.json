These shapes define enclosed or semi-enclosed regions.\n4.  **Markers:** Color 6 appears as isolated points within or near the regions defined by color 3.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves filling areas associated with the shapes defined by color 3.\n6.  **Filling Logic:** The filling seems to originate from the location of the color 6 marker. The fill uses color 3 and expands outwards until it encounters cells already containing color 3 or the grid boundaries.\n7.  **Preservation:** The original positions of cells with color 3 and color 6 in the input are preserved in the output. The transformation only changes cells with color 0 to color 3 based on the fill logic.\n8.  **Multiple Instances:** The process applies independently if multiple color 6 markers and associated shapes exist.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
