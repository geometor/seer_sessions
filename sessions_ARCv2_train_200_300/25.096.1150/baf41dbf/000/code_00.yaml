objects:
  - id: grid
    description: A 2D array of integer values representing pixels or cells.
  - id: boundary_cell
    description: A cell in the grid with the value 3. These cells form the borders of regions.
  - id: marker_cell
    description: A cell in the grid with the value 6. These act as starting points for the fill operation.
  - id: background_cell
    description: A cell in the grid with the value 0. These are candidates for being filled.
  - id: region
    description: An area implicitly defined by boundary_cells, potentially containing a marker_cell.
properties:
  - object: grid
    property: dimensions
    value: rows x columns (variable)
  - object: cell
    property: position
    value: (row, column) coordinates
  - object: cell
    property: color
    value: integer (0, 3, or 6 in input)
actions:
  - id: locate_markers
    description: Find the coordinates of all cells with value 6.
  - id: flood_fill
    description: Starting from a marker_cell's position, change connected background_cells (value 0) to the fill color (value 3).
    constraints: The fill propagates in 4 directions (up, down, left, right) and stops when it encounters a boundary_cell (value 3) or the grid edges. The fill does not change existing boundary_cells or marker_cells.
relationships:
  - type: containment
    subject: marker_cell
    object: region
    description: A marker_cell indicates which region(s) should be filled.
  - type: boundary
    subject: boundary_cell
    object: region
    description: Boundary_cells define the limits of the fill originating from a marker_cell within that region.
