            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code failed because the condition used to determine if a marker cell (6) should initiate a fill operation was incorrect. The assumption that an active marker must be directly adjacent to a boundary cell (3) was disproven by Example 3, where fills occurred for markers not adjacent to any 3s.\n\nThe analysis suggests a new hypothesis: A marker (6) is \"active\" and triggers a fill if a search (like flood fill or BFS/DFS) starting from the marker's position and propagating *only* through background cells (0) eventually reaches (i.e., becomes adjacent to) *any* boundary cell (3). If a marker is active, the fill then proceeds as before: starting from background cells (0) adjacent to the active marker, filling with color 3, and stopping at non-background cells or grid boundaries. Markers whose search only encounters other 0s or grid boundaries without reaching a '3' are inactive and do not trigger a fill.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1. Implement this new marker activation check.\n2. Collect all background cells adjacent to *any* active marker.\n3. Initiate the flood fill from these collected cells, ensuring the fill correctly propagates through background cells (0) and stops at boundaries (original 3s, original 6s, or already filled 3s).\n\n## Metrics\n\n"
