## General Assessment

The provided Python code attempts to solve the task by implementing a flood fill algorithm originating from the neighbours of marker cells (value 6). However, the results demonstrate that this implementation fails significantly on all training examples. The transformed outputs show the fill color (3) spreading across almost the entire grid, ignoring the boundaries defined by the existing cells with value 3 in the input.

The core issue appears to be that the flood fill, as implemented or initiated, does not correctly respect the containment defined by the '3' cells. The fill escapes the intended regions.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Analyze Containment:** Re-evaluate how the fill should be contained. The '3' cells act as barriers. A fill starting from a '0' cell should only propagate to other '0' cells and stop upon encountering a '3' cell or a grid boundary.
2.  **Identify Fill Origin:** Determine the correct starting point(s) for the fill. The initial code started from *all* '0' neighbours of a '6'. This might be incorrect if some neighbours lead to uncontained areas. The '6' marker likely designates *which* contained region(s) should be filled.
3.  **Refine Region Identification:** Develop a method to identify the specific region(s) of '0's that need filling, based on their relationship to the '6' markers and the '3' boundaries. The fill should only occur within regions that are effectively "bounded" by '3' cells and/or grid edges.
4.  **Update Logic:** Modify the natural language program and subsequent code implementation to perform a bounded flood fill, likely initiating only within contained regions associated with a '6' marker. A potential approach involves a "test" fill or connectivity analysis to confirm boundedness before performing the actual fill.
