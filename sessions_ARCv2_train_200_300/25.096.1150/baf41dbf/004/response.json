            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempt failed because it implemented a flood fill that originated from any background cell ('0') adjacent to *any* marker cell ('6'). This fill only stopped at grid boundaries or non-'0' cells. The analysis of the failures across the three examples revealed that this approach incorrectly filled regions associated with marker cells that were isolated from boundary cells ('3').\n\nThe key insight is that **a marker cell ('6') only initiates a fill operation if it is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to at least one boundary cell ('3').** Marker cells not adjacent to any '3's do not cause any filling, even if they are adjacent to '0's.\n\nThe revised strategy is to:\n1.  Identify all marker cells ('6').\n2.  Filter this list, keeping only those markers adjacent to at least one '3'.\n3.  Identify all background cells ('0') adjacent to these *filtered* markers. These are the fill start points.\n4.  Perform a standard flood fill (filling '0's with '3's, stopping at non-'0's) starting from these points, ensuring each connected component of '0's is filled only once.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe following metrics compare the input, expected output, and the (incorrect) transformed output from the previous attempt:\n\n"
