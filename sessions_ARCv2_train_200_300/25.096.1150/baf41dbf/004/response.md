## General Assessment

The previous code attempt failed because it implemented a flood fill that originated from any background cell ('0') adjacent to *any* marker cell ('6'). This fill only stopped at grid boundaries or non-'0' cells. The analysis of the failures across the three examples revealed that this approach incorrectly filled regions associated with marker cells that were isolated from boundary cells ('3').

The key insight is that **a marker cell ('6') only initiates a fill operation if it is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to at least one boundary cell ('3').** Marker cells not adjacent to any '3's do not cause any filling, even if they are adjacent to '0's.

The revised strategy is to:
1.  Identify all marker cells ('6').
2.  Filter this list, keeping only those markers adjacent to at least one '3'.
3.  Identify all background cells ('0') adjacent to these *filtered* markers. These are the fill start points.
4.  Perform a standard flood fill (filling '0's with '3's, stopping at non-'0's) starting from these points, ensuring each connected component of '0's is filled only once.

## Metrics

**Observations from Metrics:**
*   Grid dimensions are consistent.
*   The count of marker cells ('6') is preserved in both expected and transformed outputs.
*   The transformed outputs have significantly fewer background cells ('0') and significantly more fill cells ('3') than the expected outputs, confirming the over-filling issue.
*   The number of '3's added in the expected output varies (11 in ex1, 12 in ex2, 30 in ex3), correlating with the size of the regions filled.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Find the coordinates of all marker cells (value 6) in the input grid.
3.  Identify the "active" marker cells: a marker cell is active if at least one of its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, or right) has the value 3 (boundary cell).
4.  Identify all potential fill start cells: these are cells with value 0 (background cell) that are immediate neighbors (up, down, left, or right) of any *active* marker cell. Collect these start cell coordinates into a unique set.
5.  Iterate through the unique set of potential fill start cells. For each start cell coordinate `(r, c)`:
    a.  Check the current value of the cell at `(r, c)` in the output grid. If it is still 0 (meaning it hasn't been filled by a previous fill operation originating from a different start cell in the same connected region), then proceed to initiate a flood fill.
    b.  Perform a flood fill starting from `(r, c)` on the output grid:
        i.  Use a queue or stack for the fill process, initially containing `(r, c)`.
        ii. Change the color of the starting cell `(r, c)` in the output grid to 3.
        iii. While the queue/stack is not empty, dequeue/pop a cell coordinate `(curr_r, curr_c)`.
        iv. Examine its neighbors (up, down, left, right). For each neighbor `(nr, nc)`:
            *   Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the grid boundaries.
            *   Check if the cell at `(nr, nc)` in the output grid currently has the value 0.
            *   If both conditions are true, change the value of the cell at `(nr, nc)` in the output grid to 3 and enqueue/push `(nr, nc)`.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
