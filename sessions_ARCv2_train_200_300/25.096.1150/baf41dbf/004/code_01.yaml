objects:
  - id: grid
    description: A 2D array of integer values representing pixels or cells.
  - id: boundary_cell
    description: A cell in the grid with the value 3. These cells form borders and also act as the fill color.
  - id: marker_cell
    description: A cell in the grid with the value 6. These potentially trigger a fill operation.
  - id: background_cell
    description: A cell in the grid with the value 0. These are candidates for being filled.
  - id: active_marker_cell
    description: A marker_cell that is adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to at least one boundary_cell. Only these markers trigger fills.
  - id: fill_start_cell
    description: A background_cell that is adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to an active_marker_cell. These are the starting points for the flood fill.
  - id: fillable_region
    description: A connected component of background_cells reachable from a fill_start_cell without crossing any non-background cells.
properties:
  - object: grid
    property: dimensions
    value: rows x columns (variable)
  - object: cell
    property: position
    value: (row, column) coordinates
  - object: cell
    property: color
    value: integer (0, 3, or 6 in input)
  - object: marker_cell
    property: is_active
    value: boolean (true if adjacent to any '3', false otherwise)
actions:
  - id: identify_markers
    description: Find the coordinates of all cells with value 6.
  - id: filter_active_markers
    description: Check each marker_cell for adjacency to any boundary_cell (value 3). Keep only the active ones.
  - id: identify_fill_starts
    description: Find all background_cells (value 0) adjacent to any active_marker_cell.
  - id: flood_fill
    description: Starting from a fill_start_cell, change connected background_cells (value 0) to the fill color (value 3).
    constraints: The fill propagates in 4 directions (up, down, left, right) and stops when it encounters any non-background cell (i.e., value not 0) or the grid edges. The fill modifies the grid.

    object: fill_start_cell
    description: A fillable_region is the set of background_cells connected to a fill_start_cell.
