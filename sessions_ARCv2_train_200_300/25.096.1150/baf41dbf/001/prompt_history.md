## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of numerical values.
2.  **Color Palette:** The grids primarily use colors 0 (background), 3 (boundary/shape color), and 6 (marker color).
3.  **Shapes:** Color 3 is used to define the outlines of shapes, often rectangular or U-shaped structures. These shapes define enclosed or semi-enclosed regions.
4.  **Markers:** Color 6 appears as isolated points within or near the regions defined by color 3.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves filling areas associated with the shapes defined by color 3.
6.  **Filling Logic:** The filling seems to originate from the location of the color 6 marker. The fill uses color 3 and expands outwards until it encounters cells already containing color 3 or the grid boundaries.
7.  **Preservation:** The original positions of cells with color 3 and color 6 in the input are preserved in the output. The transformation only changes cells with color 0 to color 3 based on the fill logic.
8.  **Multiple Instances:** The process applies independently if multiple color 6 markers and associated shapes exist.

## Facts


```yaml
objects:
  - id: grid
    description: A 2D array of integer values representing pixels or cells.
  - id: boundary_cell
    description: A cell in the grid with the value 3. These cells form the borders of regions.
  - id: marker_cell
    description: A cell in the grid with the value 6. These act as starting points for the fill operation.
  - id: background_cell
    description: A cell in the grid with the value 0. These are candidates for being filled.
  - id: region
    description: An area implicitly defined by boundary_cells, potentially containing a marker_cell.
properties:
  - object: grid
    property: dimensions
    value: rows x columns (variable)
  - object: cell
    property: position
    value: (row, column) coordinates
  - object: cell
    property: color
    value: integer (0, 3, or 6 in input)
actions:
  - id: locate_markers
    description: Find the coordinates of all cells with value 6.
  - id: flood_fill
    description: Starting from a marker_cell's position, change connected background_cells (value 0) to the fill color (value 3).
    constraints: The fill propagates in 4 directions (up, down, left, right) and stops when it encounters a boundary_cell (value 3) or the grid edges. The fill does not change existing boundary_cells or marker_cells.
relationships:
  - type: containment
    subject: marker_cell
    object: region
    description: A marker_cell indicates which region(s) should be filled.
  - type: boundary
    subject: boundary_cell
    object: region
    description: Boundary_cells define the limits of the fill originating from a marker_cell within that region.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the locations (row, column coordinates) of all cells in the input grid that have the value 6 (marker cells).
3.  For each identified marker cell location:
    a.  Initiate a flood fill operation starting from this location.
    b.  Use the color 3 as the fill color.
    c.  The fill should only change cells that currently have the value 0 (background cells).
    d.  The fill propagates to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).
    e.  The fill stops propagating into a cell if that cell is outside the grid boundaries or if that cell already contains the value 3 (boundary cell).
    f.  Modify the output grid by changing the color of the filled cells to 3.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
