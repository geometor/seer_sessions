Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 15x15 grids containing integers.
2.  **Key Values:** The grids primarily use three distinct values:
    *   `0`: Represents the background, largely static between input and output.
    *   `2`: Forms a rectangular frame or border in the input. This frame remains unchanged in the output.
    *   `5`: Represents content pieces. In the input, these '5's are located *inside* the '2' frame. In the output, the original '5's are gone, and new '5's appear *outside* the '2' frame.
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation involves the '5's. Their positions change based on the '2' frame. The original '5's inside the frame are effectively moved or mirrored to new positions outside the frame.
4.  **Frame Properties:** The '2' frame has a specific location (defined by its minimum and maximum row and column) and dimensions (height and width). These properties seem crucial for the transformation.
5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The placement of the new '5's in the output appears to be a reflection of the original '5's across the boundaries of the '2' frame. The axis of reflection (horizontal or vertical) seems dependent on the aspect ratio (width vs. height) of the '2' frame.
