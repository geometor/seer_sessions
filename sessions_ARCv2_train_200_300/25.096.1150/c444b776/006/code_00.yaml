task_description: Replicate grid patterns based on separator lines.
grid_properties:
  type: 2D array
  content: Integers (0-9 observed)
  separator_value: 4

separator_lines:
  - type: horizontal
    value: 4
    detection: Find the first row composed entirely of the separator_value. Let its index be 'hr'.
    function: Divides the grid into 'above' (rows 0 to hr-1) and 'below' (rows hr+1 to end) regions.
  - type: vertical
    value: 4
    detection: Find the first column composed entirely of the separator_value. Let its index be 'vc'.
    function: Divides the grid into 'left' (columns 0 to vc-1) and 'right' (columns vc+1 to end) regions.

transformation_cases:
  - condition: Horizontal separator found (hr is not None), Vertical separator not found (vc is None).
    source_pattern: Region 'above' the horizontal separator (rows 0 to hr-1, all columns).
    action: Copy the source_pattern to the region 'below' the horizontal separator (rows hr+1 to end, all columns). Overwrite existing content. Truncate source_pattern if target region is smaller.
  - condition: Vertical separator found (vc is not None), Horizontal separator not found (hr is None).
    source_pattern: Region 'left' of the vertical separator (all rows, columns 0 to vc-1).
    action: Copy the source_pattern to the region 'right' of the vertical separator (all rows, columns vc+1 to end). Overwrite existing content. Truncate source_pattern if target region is smaller.
  - condition: Both horizontal (hr) and vertical (vc) separators found.
    source_pattern: Top-left quadrant (rows 0 to hr-1, columns 0 to vc-1).
    action:
      - Copy the source_pattern to the top-right quadrant (rows 0 to hr-1, columns vc+1 to end).
      - Copy the source_pattern to the bottom-left quadrant (rows hr+1 to end, columns 0 to vc-1).
      - Copy the source_pattern to the bottom-right quadrant (rows hr+1 to end, columns vc+1 to end).
    details: Overwrite existing content in target quadrants. Truncate source_pattern if target quadrants are smaller.
  - condition: No separators found (hr is None and vc is None).
    action: Output grid is identical to the input grid.

unchanged_elements:
  - The separator lines (row hr and/or column vc) remain unchanged in the output grid.

output_initialization: Start with an output grid identical to the input grid, then modify based on the applicable transformation case.
