These lines act as dividers or axes of symmetry/replication.\n3.  **Source Pattern:** The region(s) of the grid *before* the separator line(s) seem to define a source pattern. In `train_1`, this is the area above the horizontal line. In `train_2`, this is the top-left quadrant defined by both lines.\n4.  **Replication:** The transformation involves replicating the source pattern into other regions defined by the separator lines. The separator lines themselves remain unchanged.\n5.  **Replication Types:**\n    *   `train_1`: The pattern above the horizontal line is copied to the area below the line.\n    *   `train_2`: The pattern in the top-left quadrant is copied to the top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right quadrants.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
