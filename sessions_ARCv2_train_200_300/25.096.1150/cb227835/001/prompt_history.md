*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input is a 2D grid containing predominantly zeros (0) and exactly two eights (8).
    *   The output is also a 2D grid of the same dimensions.
    *   The output grid retains the original positions of the eights (8).
    *   The output grid introduces threes (3) which appear to form a path or line connecting the locations of the two original eights.
    *   The background remains zero (0).
    *   The path traced by the threes seems to represent a digital line segment (similar to one generated by Bresenham's line algorithm) between the coordinates of the two eights.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - element: grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array of integers
          - values: 0, 3, 8
      - element: input_grid
        properties:
          - contains: background value (0)
          - contains: exactly two marker points (8)
      - element: output_grid
        properties:
          - derived_from: input_grid
          - retains: original marker points (8)
          - contains: path points (3)
          - contains: background value (0)
    transformation:
      - action: locate_markers
        input: input_grid
        value: 8
        output: coordinates of two '8' cells (point1, point2)
      - action: draw_line
        start_point: point1
        end_point: point2
        algorithm: digital line drawing (e.g., Bresenham's)
        output: set of coordinates representing the line path
      - action: generate_output_grid
        based_on: input_grid dimensions
        steps:
          - Initialize output grid with zeros.
          - For each coordinate in the line path:
              - If the coordinate matches point1 or point2, set the output grid value to 8.
              - Otherwise, set the output grid value to 3.
    relationships:
      - The threes (3) in the output grid form a connection path between the two eights (8).
      - The path is a discrete representation of the straight line segment connecting the centers of the cells containing the eights.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify the row and column coordinates of the two cells in the input grid that contain the value 8. Let these coordinates be (r1, c1) and (r2, c2).
    3.  Determine the set of grid cells that lie on the digital straight line segment connecting (r1, c1) and (r2, c2). Use an algorithm like Bresenham's line algorithm to find these intermediate cell coordinates.
    4.  Iterate through the coordinates of the cells identified in step 3.
    5.  For each coordinate (r, c) in this set:
        *   If (r, c) is not equal to (r1, c1) and not equal to (r2, c2), change the value of the cell at (r, c) in the output grid to 3.
    6.  The cells at (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) in the output grid retain their original value of 8. All other cells not part of the line path retain their original value of 0.
    7.  Return the modified output grid.
