Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) containing single-digit integers.
2.  **Grid Contents:** The grids primarily consist of the number 8, with sparse occurrences of the number 1.
3.  **Transformation:** The output grid is largely identical to the input grid. The only difference is that specific instances of the number 8 in the input are changed to the number 4 in the output.
4.  **Pattern Recognition:** The change from 8 to 4 seems dependent on the local neighbourhood of the cell within its row. Comparing the input and output grids reveals that an '8' is changed to a '4' only when it is the central '8' within a specific horizontal sequence: `1 1 8 8 8 1 1`.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Transform a 2D grid by replacing specific '8' values with '4' based on a local horizontal pattern.
elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers.
    properties:
      - rows: integer
      - columns: integer
      - cells: list of lists of integers
  - object: cell
    description: An individual element within the grid.
    properties:
      - value: integer (primarily 1 or 8 in input, 1, 4, or 8 in output)
      - row_index: integer
      - column_index: integer
  - object: pattern
    description: A specific horizontal sequence triggering a transformation.
    properties:
      - sequence: [1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1]
      - target_cell_relative_index: 3 # The middle '8' in the sequence
      - replacement_value: 4
actions:
  - action: find_pattern
    description: Scan each row of the input grid to locate occurrences of the defined pattern sequence.
    inputs:
      - grid
      - pattern.sequence
    outputs:
      - list of locations (row_index, column_index_of_target_cell) where the pattern's target cell is found.
  - action: replace_value
    description: Create the output grid by copying the input grid and modifying the value of cells identified by find_pattern.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - list_of_locations
      - pattern.replacement_value
    outputs:
      - output_grid
relationships:
  - The value of a cell in the output grid depends on its value and its horizontal neighbors in the input grid.
  - An '8' in the input grid becomes a '4' in the output grid if and only if it is the third '8' (at index `i+3`) in a sequence `1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1` starting at index `i` within the same row.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3.  Within each row, slide a window of size 7 across the columns, from left to right.
4.  For each window position, check if the sequence of numbers matches the pattern `[1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1]`.
5.  If the pattern is matched starting at column index `j`, identify the cell corresponding to the middle '8' of the pattern. This cell is located at the current row index and column index `j + 3`.
6.  Change the value of this identified cell in the *output* grid to `4`.
7.  After checking all rows and all possible window positions, return the modified output grid.
