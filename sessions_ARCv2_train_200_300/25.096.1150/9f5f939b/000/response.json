The only difference is that specific instances of the number 8 in the input are changed to the number 4 in the output.\n4.  **Pattern Recognition:** The change from 8 to 4 seems dependent on the local neighbourhood of the cell within its row. Comparing the input and output grids reveals that an '8' is changed to a '4' only when it is the central '8' within a specific horizontal sequence: `1 1 8 8 8 1 1`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
