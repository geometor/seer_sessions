task_description: Transform a 2D grid by replacing specific '8' values with '4' based on a local horizontal pattern.
elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers.
    properties:
      - rows: integer
      - columns: integer
      - cells: list of lists of integers
  - object: cell
    description: An individual element within the grid.
    properties:
      - value: integer (primarily 1 or 8 in input, 1, 4, or 8 in output)
      - row_index: integer
      - column_index: integer
  - object: pattern
    description: A specific horizontal sequence triggering a transformation.
    properties:
      - sequence: [1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1]
      - target_cell_relative_index: 3 # The middle '8' in the sequence
      - replacement_value: 4
actions:
  - action: find_pattern
    description: Scan each row of the input grid to locate occurrences of the defined pattern sequence.
    inputs:
      - grid
      - pattern.sequence
    outputs:
      - list of locations (row_index, column_index_of_target_cell) where the pattern's target cell is found.
  - action: replace_value
    description: Create the output grid by copying the input grid and modifying the value of cells identified by find_pattern.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - list_of_locations
      - pattern.replacement_value
    outputs:
      - output_grid
relationships:
  - The value of a cell in the output grid depends on its value and its horizontal neighbors in the input grid.
  - An '8' in the input grid becomes a '4' in the output grid if and only if it is the third '8' (at index `i+3`) in a sequence `1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1` starting at index `i` within the same row.
