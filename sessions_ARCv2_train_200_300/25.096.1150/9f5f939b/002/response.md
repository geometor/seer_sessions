**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis identified the core pattern `[1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1]` leading to the transformation of the central '8' to a '4'. This held true for the first two examples. However, the results for `train_3` revealed that this pattern alone is insufficient. The code generated based on the initial hypothesis incorrectly applied the transformation in two instances within `train_3`.

Specifically reviewing `train_3`:
*   In row 5 (`8 8 1 1 8 8 8 1 1 8 8 8 1 1 8 8`), the pattern occurs twice. The first occurrence (starting index 2, target index 5) should be ignored, while the second (starting index 7, target index 10) should be applied.
*   In row 12 (`1 1 8 8 8 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8`), the pattern occurs once at the beginning (starting index 0, target index 3), but this transformation should be ignored.

Comparing these failed cases with the successful ones suggests two additional conditions are required for the transformation to occur:
1.  The cell directly above the target '8' must also be an '8'.
2.  The cell immediately following the 7-element pattern `[1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1]` must *not* be a '1'. (If the pattern occurs at the very end of a row, this condition is met).

The strategy is to update the understanding of the transformation rule to incorporate these two constraints.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's verify the locations and constraints for each transformation.
