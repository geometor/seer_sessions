task_description: Transform a 2D grid by replacing specific '8' values with '4' based on local horizontal patterns and adjacency conditions.
elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers.
    properties:
      - rows: integer (e.g., 8, 16)
      - columns: integer (e.g., 8, 16)
      - cells: list of lists of integers
  - object: cell
    description: An individual element within the grid.
    properties:
      - value: integer (1, 8 in input; 1, 4, 8 in output)
      - row_index: integer
      - column_index: integer
  - object: pattern
    description: The primary horizontal sequence triggering a potential transformation.
    properties:
      - sequence: [1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1]
      - length: 7
      - target_cell_relative_index: 3 # The middle '8'
      - replacement_value: 4
  - object: pattern_instance
    description: A specific occurrence of the pattern within a row.
    properties:
      - row_index: integer
      - start_column_index: integer
      - target_cell_column_index: integer (start_column_index + 3)
conditions_for_change:
  - condition: pattern_match
    description: The sequence of 7 cells starting at (row_index, start_column_index) must match pattern.sequence.
  - condition: cell_above_is_8
    description: The cell directly above the target cell (row_index - 1, target_cell_column_index) must have a value of 8. Requires row_index > 0.
  - condition: suppression_check
    description: Another instance of the pattern must NOT start 5 columns after the current pattern instance.
    properties:
      - suppression_start_column_index: integer (start_column_index + 5)
      - check: The sequence of 7 cells starting at (row_index, suppression_start_column_index) must NOT match pattern.sequence (respecting grid boundaries).
actions:
  - action: find_potential_changes
    description: Scan each row (from row 1 onwards) of the input grid to locate pattern instances satisfying the pattern_match and cell_above_is_8 conditions.
    inputs:
      - grid
      - pattern.sequence
    outputs:
      - list of potential change locations [(row_index, target_cell_column_index, start_column_index)]
  - action: filter_suppressed_changes
    description: Remove potential changes from the list if they meet the suppression_check condition.
    inputs:
      - grid
      - pattern.sequence
      - list of potential change locations
    outputs:
      - list of confirmed change locations [(row_index, target_cell_column_index)]
  - action: apply_changes
    description: Create the output grid by copying the input grid and modifying the value of cells identified in the confirmed change locations.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - list_of_confirmed_locations
      - pattern.replacement_value
    outputs:
      - output_grid
relationships:
  - The value of a cell in the output grid depends on its value, its horizontal neighbors, the cell directly above it, and the potential presence of another pattern instance slightly offset horizontally in the input grid.
  - A change from 8 to 4 occurs only if all three conditions (pattern_match, cell_above_is_8, suppression_check passes) are met for that specific location.
