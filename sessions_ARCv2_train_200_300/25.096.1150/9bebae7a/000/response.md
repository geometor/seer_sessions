*   **Perception:** The task involves manipulating 2D grids containing integer values. Each input grid features two distinct connected shapes, one composed of the integer '4' and the other of the integer '6', on a background of '0's. The output grid retains only the shape made of '4's, but its position is altered. The shape made of '6's is completely removed in the output. The transformation rule appears to involve using the position of the '6' shape to determine the new location for the '4' shape. Specifically, the '4' shape seems to be translated vertically.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - object: grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array of integers
          - dimensions: variable (e.g., 6x10, 12x10, 10x10, 11x10, 11x13)
          - background_value: 0
      - object: shape_4
        properties:
          - color: 4
          - role: primary object, to be moved
          - reference_point: top-most cell (minimum row index), tie-break with minimum column index
      - object: shape_6
        properties:
          - color: 6
          - role: reference object, determines vertical position
          - reference_point: bottom-most cell (maximum row index), tie-break with minimum column index
          - presence_in_output: absent (removed)
    actions:
      - action: identify_shape
        parameters:
          - color_value (4 or 6)
        output: set of coordinates for the shape
      - action: find_reference_point
        parameters:
          - shape_coordinates
          - point_type ('top-most' or 'bottom-most')
        output: reference coordinate (row, column)
      - action: calculate_translation
        parameters:
          - shape_4_reference_point
          - shape_6_reference_point
        output: vertical_shift (delta_row)
      - action: translate_shape
        parameters:
          - shape_4_coordinates
          - vertical_shift
        output: new coordinates for shape_4
      - action: generate_output_grid
        parameters:
          - input_grid_dimensions
          - translated_shape_4_coordinates
        output: final grid with translated shape_4 and background_value elsewhere
    relationships:
      - The vertical position (row index) of the 'shape_6' reference point determines the new vertical position (row index) of the 'shape_4' reference point in the output.
      - The horizontal position (column index) of the 'shape_4' reference point remains unchanged relative to its original position during the translation.
      - The 'shape_6' itself is removed from the output grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color '0'.
    2.  Identify all cells in the input grid containing the value '4' (shape_4).
    3.  Identify all cells in the input grid containing the value '6' (shape_6).
    4.  Determine the reference point for shape_4: Find the cell(s) with the minimum row index. If there are multiple, select the one among them with the minimum column index. Let this be `(r4_ref, c4_ref)`.
    5.  Determine the reference point for shape_6: Find the cell(s) with the maximum row index. If there are multiple, select the one among them with the minimum column index. Let this be `(r6_ref, c6_ref)`.
    6.  Calculate the vertical shift required: `delta_r = r6_ref - r4_ref`. The horizontal shift `delta_c` is 0.
    7.  For each cell `(r, c)` belonging to shape_4 in the input grid:
        a.  Calculate its new position in the output grid: `new_r = r + delta_r`, `new_c = c + delta_c` (which is just `c`).
        b.  If the `new_r` and `new_c` are within the bounds of the output grid, set the value of the cell at `(new_r, new_c)` in the output grid to '4'.
    8.  Return the modified output grid.
