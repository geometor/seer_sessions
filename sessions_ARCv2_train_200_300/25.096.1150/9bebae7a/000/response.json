Each input grid features two distinct connected shapes, one composed of the integer '4' and the other of the integer '6', on a background of '0's. The output grid retains only the shape made of '4's, but its position is altered. The shape made of '6's is completely removed in the output. The transformation rule appears to involve using the position of the '6' shape to determine the new location for the '4' shape. Specifically, the '4' shape seems to be translated vertically.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
