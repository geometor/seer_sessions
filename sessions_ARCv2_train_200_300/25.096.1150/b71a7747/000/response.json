Both input grids exhibit repeating patterns, suggesting a block-based structure. The output grid seems to be a sub-section of the input grid, composed of specific numbers found within the input. The transformation appears to involve selecting specific rows and columns from the input based on their indices and the grid's repeating pattern, and then assembling the output grid from the values at the intersections of these selected rows and columns. Boundary rows and columns seem to be treated differently.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
