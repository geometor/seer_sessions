*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a larger input grid of numbers into a smaller output grid. Both input grids exhibit repeating patterns, suggesting a block-based structure. The output grid seems to be a sub-section of the input grid, composed of specific numbers found within the input. The transformation appears to involve selecting specific rows and columns from the input based on their indices and the grid's repeating pattern, and then assembling the output grid from the values at the intersections of these selected rows and columns. Boundary rows and columns seem to be treated differently.

```yaml
    task: grid_transformation
    
    input_elements:
      - object: input_grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array of integers
          - structure: contains repeating blocks or patterns
          - dimensions: H (height) x W (width)
    
    output_elements:
      - object: output_grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array of integers
          - dimensions: smaller than input_grid
          - content: derived from a subset of input_grid values
    
    transformation:
      action: subgrid_extraction
      parameters:
        - name: block_size
          symbol: B
          description: The size of the repeating block structure in the input_grid.
          inference: Determined by observing the periodicity of patterns or border elements in the input grid. (e.g., B=4 for train_1, B=6 for train_2)
        - name: target_remainders
          symbol: M
          description: A set of integers representing the remainders when selected row/column indices are divided by B.
          inference: Determined by identifying the modulo B values of indices corresponding to the desired elements or excluding indices corresponding to border/separator elements. (e.g., M={0, 2, 3} for train_1, M={5, 0, 1} for train_2)
        - name: boundary_handling
          description: Specific rows and columns at the edges of the grid are excluded from selection.
          rule: Exclude rows 0, 1, H-2, H-1 and columns 0, 1, W-2, W-1. More precisely, select indices i where 1 < i < Dim-2.
    
    relationship:
      - type: selection
        subject: input_grid rows and columns
        rule: Select row index 'r' if 1 < r < H-2 and (r % B) is in M. Select column index 'c' if 1 < c < W-2 and (c % B) is in M.
      - type: construction
        subject: output_grid
        rule: Constructed from input_grid[r][c] for all selected pairs of (r, c), preserving relative order.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the block size `B` of the repeating pattern within the input grid.
    2.  Determine the set `M` of index remainders modulo `B` that identify the rows and columns to be potentially included in the output. This can often be found by taking all possible remainders {0, 1, ..., B-1} and removing the remainder(s) associated with the separating or border elements in the pattern.
    3.  Get the height `H` and width `W` of the input grid.
    4.  Create a list of selected row indices by iterating through row indices `r` from 2 up to (but not including) `H-2`. Keep index `r` if `(r % B)` is present in the set `M`.
    5.  Create a list of selected column indices by iterating through column indices `c` from 2 up to (but not including) `W-2`. Keep index `c` if `(c % B)` is present in the set `M`.
    6.  Construct the output grid: For each selected row index `r` (in order) and each selected column index `c` (in order), the corresponding element in the output grid is the value from the input grid at `input[r][c]`.
