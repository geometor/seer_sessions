    """
    Transforms an input grid based on periodic block patterns.

    1.  Determines the block size `B` of the repeating pattern within the input grid (handling specific cases).
    2.  Determines the set `M` of index remainders modulo `B` that identify the rows and columns to be selected (handling specific cases).
    3.  Gets the height `H` and width `W` of the input grid.
    4.  Creates a list of selected row indices by iterating through row indices `r` from 2 up to (but not including) `H-2`. Keeps index `r` if `(r % B)` is present in the set `M`.
    5.  Creates a list of selected column indices by iterating through column indices `c` from 2 up to (but not including) `W-2`. Keeps index `c` if `(c % B)` is present in the set `M`.
    6.  Constructs the output grid: For each selected row index `r` (in order) and each selected column index `c` (in order), the corresponding element in the output grid is the value from the input grid at `input[r][c]`.
