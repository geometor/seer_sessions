Find all non-zero markers in the input grid.\n2. For each marker, determine the coordinates/values for its corresponding pattern:\n    - Marker 1 at (r, c): Draws [1, 5, 5] at [(r, c), (r, c+1), (r, c+2)] AND places a 'shadow' 1 at (r-1, c+2).\n    - Marker 2 at (r, c): Draws [2, 5, 5, 5, 2] at [(r, c-4), (r, c-3), (r, c-2), (r, c-1), (r, c)].\n    - Marker 3 at (r, c): Draws [3, 5, 5, 3] at [(r, c), (r+1, c), (r+2, c), (r+3, c)].\n    - Marker 6 at (r, c): Draws [6, 5, ..., 5, 6] (length 7) at [(r-6, c), (r-5, c), ..., (r, c)].\n3. Store endpoint values (1, 2, 3, 6) and the shadow '1' from marker 1 in a priority placement map.\n4. Store path values (5) in a separate structure, tracking which marker(s) painted each cell.\n5. Apply priority placements directly to the output grid.\n6. Identify intersection cells where more than one marker painted a path (5).\n7. Apply path (5) and intersection (4) colors:\n    - If a cell is an intersection, write 4 to the output grid (overwriting priority placements if necessary, although unlikely by design).\n    - If a cell was painted by only one path (5) AND the cell is currently 0 in the output grid, write 5.\n8. For each intersection cell (now containing 4), draw a diagonal line of 4s starting one cell down-left and continuing down-left until the grid boundary (overwriting any existing values).\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rules to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the 2D input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed 2D output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not input_grid or not input_grid[0]:\n        return []\n\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n    \n    # Initialize output grid with zeros\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n    \n    # Structure to track cells painted with '5' and by which marker(s)\n    # {(r, c): [marker_id_1, marker_id_2, ...]}\n    path_painters = collections.defaultdict(list)\n    \n    # Structure to store placements that take priority (endpoints, shadow '1')\n    # {(r, c): value}\n    priority_placements = {}\n\n    # --- 1.
