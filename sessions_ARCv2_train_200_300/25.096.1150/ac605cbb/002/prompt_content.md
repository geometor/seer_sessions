"""
This module transforms a 2D grid based on marker values (1, 2, 3, 6).

Transformation Rules:
1. Find all non-zero markers in the input grid.
2. For each marker, draw a line segment based on its value:
    - 1: Horizontal line [1, 5, 5] starting at the marker and extending right.
    - 2: Horizontal line [2, 5, 5, 5, 2] ending at the marker and extending left.
    - 3: Vertical line [3, 5, 5, 3] starting at the marker and extending down.
    - 6: Vertical line [6, 5, ..., 5, 6] ending at the marker and extending up (length 7).
3. Lines are composed of endpoint colors (matching the marker) and path color 5.
4. If paths (color 5) from different line segments overlap at a cell, that cell becomes color 4 (intersection).
5. From each intersection cell (color 4), draw a diagonal line of color 4 extending down and left until the grid boundary.
6. The final output grid reflects these drawn lines and intersections, overwriting initial values where necessary (endpoints overwrite 0s/5s, intersections overwrite 5s, diagonals overwrite existing values).
