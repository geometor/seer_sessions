In each case, the generated output was missing a single pixel compared to the expected output.\n    *   The missing pixel is consistently a `1` located one row above and two columns to the right of the *original* marker `1` position: `(r-1, c+2)`. This suggests an additional rule specifically for marker `1`, which we can call a \"shadow\" point or reflected endpoint.\n    *   The strategy is to modify the natural language program and subsequently the code to add this specific rule for marker `1`, while keeping the rest of the logic intact.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   **Example 1:** Failed. 1 pixel difference. Expected `1` at `(3, 5)`, Generated `0`. Marker `1` is at `(4, 3)`. `(3, 5)` is `(4-1, 3+2)`.\n    *   **Example 2:** Failed. 1 pixel difference. Expected `1` at `(4, 8)`, Generated `0`. Marker `1` is at `(5, 6)`. `(4, 8)` is `(5-1, 6+2)`.\n    *   **Example 3:** Passed. Contains markers `2` and `3`, intersections, and diagonals. Confirms those rules are likely correct.\n    *   **Example 4:** Failed. 1 pixel difference. Expected `1` at `(8, 9)`, Generated `0`. Marker `1` is at `(9, 7)`. `(8, 9)` is `(9-1, 7+2)`. Also contains markers `2` and `6`, intersections, and diagonals, which seem correctly handled apart from the missing `1`.\n    *   **Example 5:** Failed. 1 pixel difference. Expected `1` at `(1, 5)`, Generated `0`. Marker `1` is at `(2, 3)`. `(1, 5)` is `(2-1, 3+2)`. Also contains markers `2` and `3`, correctly handled.\n    *   **Example 6:** Passed. Contains only marker `6`. Confirms the rule for marker `6` is likely correct.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    \n"

Create a temporary data structure (e.g., a dictionary mapping coordinates to values) to store endpoint placements and the shadow point placement for marker `1`.\n    4.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid.\n    5.  If a cell contains a marker `N` (non-zero value):\n        *   Determine the sequence of cells and their corresponding values (endpoint `N` or path `5`) for the line segment based on `N`:\n            *   If `N = 1`: Cells `(r, c)=1`, `(r, c+1)=5`, `(r, c+2)=5`.

Any cell `(ri, ci)` associated with more than one marker ID is an intersection. Store these intersection coordinates.\n    8.  Draw paths and intersections: Iterate through the path tracking structure again.
