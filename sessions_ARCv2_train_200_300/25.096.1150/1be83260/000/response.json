            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation from input to output.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input is a grid containing integer values. It features distinct rectangular blocks composed primarily of non-zero numbers (like '2' in `train_1`, '1' in `train_2`), separated by rows and columns filled entirely with zeros ('0').\n2.  **Foreground/Background Distinction:** Within the non-zero blocks, one number acts as a 'background' color (the most frequent one, e.g., '2' or '1'). Other non-zero numbers ('1', '3', '4' in `train_1`; '2', '4', '8' in `train_2`) act as 'foreground' or 'marker' colors.\n3.  **Special Block:** Typically, only one of the non-zero blocks in the input contains these foreground/marker colors. This block seems to be treated differently.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the background color within each block. The new color depends on whether the block is the 'special' block or a 'normal' block, and potentially its relative position. Foreground colors within the special block are preserved.\n5.  **Output Structure:** The output grid consists of the transformed blocks, stitched together. The zero-separators from the input are removed, and new separators (single rows/columns) are inserted between the blocks in the output. The color used for these separators appears to be the original background color from the input.\n6.  **Color Mapping:**\n    *   **Special Block:** The background color changes to a specific value derived from the foreground colors present within that block (in `train_1`, BG '2' changes to '3'; in `train_2`, BG '1' changes to '8' - potentially the foreground color with the highest column index).\n    *   **Normal Blocks:** The background color changes based on the block's relative position in the input grid layout. The new colors seem to be drawn from the set of foreground colors found in the special block, potentially assigned based on position (e.g., TL, TR, BL mapping to sorted foreground colors). The exact mapping rule needs careful definition, especially when the number of normal blocks differs from the number of distinct foreground colors.\n    *   **Separators:** The separators introduced in the output use the original background color.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
