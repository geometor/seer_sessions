"""
The transformation identifies distinct rectangular blocks of non-zero numbers in the input grid, separated by rows and columns of zeros.
It identifies one 'special' block containing foreground colors (colors different from the most frequent non-zero color within that block, which is the background color).
All blocks share the same original background color.
The transformation modifies the background color of each block based on a mapping determined by the set of foreground colors found in the special block and the block's position in the output grid layout.
Foreground colors within each block are preserved.
The output grid reassembles the transformed blocks in their original relative layout (e.g., 2x2), inserting single rows/columns of the original background color as separators between them.

The specific mapping observed from output grid position (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) to the new background color, based on the foreground colors (FG) found in the special block, is:
- If FG = {1, 3, 4}: TL->3, TR->1, BL->4, BR->1
- If FG = {2, 4, 8}: TL->2, TR->8, BL->4, BR->8

The separator color used in the output is the original background color common to all input blocks.
