Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of integers (pixels). The dominant value is 0, representing the background.
2.  **Key Colors/Objects:**
    *   **Color 0:** Background.
    *   **Colors 1 and 8:** These colors form a single, connected 3x3 block in each input grid. This block appears to be the primary object undergoing transformation.
    *   **Color 4:** These appear as isolated points in the input. They seem to act as signals or triggers influencing the transformation.
3.  **Transformation Core:** The central action involves modifying the 3x3 block of 1s and 8s and relocating one of the '4's based on its position relative to the block.
4.  **Input Variations:** The position and internal pattern of the 3x3 block vary, as do the number and positions of the '4's.
5.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains the background. The 3x3 block (potentially altered) remains in its original position. Only one '4' remains, moved to a new position determined by the input configuration. All other '4's from the input are removed.
6.  **Conditional Logic:** The specific transformation applied to the 3x3 block and the rule for moving the '4' appear to depend on the vertical distance between the 3x3 block and the "determining" '4' (the topmost, leftmost one).
    *   If the determining '4' is 1 row above the block, one set of rules applies (Rule A).
    *   If the determining '4' is 2 rows above the block, a different set of rules applies (Rule B).

## Facts


```yaml
elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing pixels.
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: An integer value (0, 1, 4, 8 observed).
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
  - object: background
    description: Pixels with color 0.
  - object: main_block
    description: A connected 3x3 component composed entirely of pixels with colors 1 and 8. There is exactly one such block in each input.
    properties:
      - top_left_corner: (row, column) of the top-left pixel of the block.
      - pattern: The specific 3x3 array of 1s and 8s.
  - object: signal_pixels
    description: Pixels with color 4. They appear isolated.
    properties:
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.

relationships:
  - relation: relative_position
    object1: determining_signal_pixel
    object2: main_block
    description: The row and column difference between the determining signal pixel (topmost, then leftmost '4') and the top-left corner of the main_block. This relative position dictates the transformation rules applied.

actions:
  - action: identify_main_block
    input: input_grid
    output: main_block object (pattern and position)
  - action: identify_signal_pixels
    input: input_grid
    output: list of signal_pixel objects (positions)
  - action: select_determining_signal
    input: list of signal_pixels
    output: one signal_pixel object (the one with the minimum row index, breaking ties with the minimum column index)
  - action: determine_rule_set
    input: relative_position (determining_signal to main_block)
    output: rule_identifier ('Rule A' or 'Rule B')
    logic: |
      If relative_row = -1, use Rule A.
      If relative_row = -2, use Rule B.
  - action: transform_main_block
    input: main_block pattern, rule_identifier
    output: transformed_main_block pattern
    logic: |
      Applies a specific, fixed 3x3 transformation based on the rule_identifier (T_A or T_B, derived from examples). The transformation swaps an equal number of 1s and 8s within the block. The block remains in its original position in the grid.
      - T_A (Rule A): Observed in examples 1 and 3.
      - T_B (Rule B): Observed in examples 2 and 4.
  - action: move_determining_signal
    input: determining_signal position, rule_identifier
    output: new_signal_position
    logic: |
      Calculates the output position for the determining signal pixel based on the rule_identifier.
      - Rule A: new_position = (input_row + 4, input_col)
      - Rule B: new_position = (input_row + 1, input_col + 1)
  - action: construct_output_grid
    input: input_grid_dimensions, transformed_main_block (pattern and position), new_signal_position
    output: output_grid
    logic: |
      Create a new grid filled with 0s.
      Place the transformed_main_block pattern at its original position.
      Place a '4' at the new_signal_position.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Objects:**
    a.  Scan the input grid to find the 3x3 connected component consisting solely of pixels with values 1 and 8. Record its pattern and the coordinates of its top-left corner. This is the `main_block`.
    b.  Scan the input grid to find all pixels with value 4. Record their coordinates. These are the `signal_pixels`.
2.  **Select Key Signal:**
    a.  From the list of `signal_pixels`, find the one with the minimum row index.
    b.  If there are multiple signal pixels with the same minimum row index, select the one among them with the minimum column index. This is the `determining_signal`.
3.  **Determine Transformation Rules:**
    a.  Calculate the relative row offset between the `determining_signal` and the `main_block` ( `determining_signal.row - main_block.top_left_row`).
    b.  If the relative row offset is -1, select **Rule Set A**.
    c.  If the relative row offset is -2, select **Rule Set B**.
4.  **Apply Transformations:**
    a.  **Transform Block:** Apply the specific 3x3 pattern transformation corresponding to the selected Rule Set (`T_A` for Rule Set A, `T_B` for Rule Set B, as observed in the training examples) to the `main_block`'s pattern. The block's position in the grid does not change.
    b.  **Move Signal:** Calculate the new position for the `determining_signal` based on the selected Rule Set:
        *   If Rule Set A: `new_signal_position = (determining_signal.row + 4, determining_signal.col)`
        *   If Rule Set B: `new_signal_position = (determining_signal.row + 1, determining_signal.col + 1)`
5.  **Construct Output:**
    a.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized with 0s.
    b.  Place the transformed `main_block` pattern onto the new grid at its original top-left corner coordinates.
    c.  Place a pixel with value 4 at the calculated `new_signal_position` in the new grid.
    d.  The resulting grid is the output.
