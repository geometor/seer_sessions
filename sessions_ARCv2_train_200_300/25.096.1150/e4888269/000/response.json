            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Data Structure:** The input and output are represented as 2D grids (matrices) of integers. Based on the examples, the grid dimensions appear fixed at 10 rows and 20 columns.\n2.  **Content:** The grids contain mostly zeros, with some non-zero integer values scattered, particularly in the earlier columns and specific cells later in the rows. Column 9 (index 9) consistently contains the value 2.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation from input to output involves modifying the values of specific cells while leaving the rest of the grid unchanged. The majority of the grid structure and values are preserved.\n4.  **Key Locations:** The changes consistently occur at three specific cell coordinates (using 0-based indexing):\n    *   Row 2, Column 14\n    *   Row 6, Column 11\n    *   Row 7, Column 18\n5.  **Value Mapping:**\n    *   The value at (2, 14) in the input (which is 6 in all examples) is always changed to 7 in the output.\n    *   The value at (6, 11) in the input (which is 3 in all examples) is always changed to 5 in the output.\n    *   The value at (7, 18) in the input (which is 1 in all examples) changes to a value in the output that varies between examples (7, 6, 4).\n6.  **Conditional Change:** The final value for the cell at (7, 18) appears dependent on the value found in the input grid at coordinates (3, 1) (4th row, 2nd column). If input(3, 1) is non-zero, output(7, 18) takes that value. If input(3, 1) is zero, output(7, 18) becomes 4.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
