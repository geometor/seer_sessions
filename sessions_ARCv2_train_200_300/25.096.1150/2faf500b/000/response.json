Specifically, the '6' markers themselves and the '9's immediately adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to them are removed (turned into 0s). Other '9's and all '0's remain unchanged.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Create a list of coordinates for all cells in the input grid that contain the value 6.\n3.  Create a second list to store the coordinates of cells to be changed to 0. Add all coordinates from the list created in step 2 to this second list.\n4.  Iterate through each coordinate `(r, c)` identified in step 2 (where the input value is 6).\n5.  For each such coordinate `(r, c)`, examine its four direct neighbors (up, down, left, right): `(r-1, c)`, `(r+1, c)`, `(r, c-1)`, `(r, c+1)`.\n6.  If a neighbor exists within the grid boundaries *and* its value in the *input* grid is 9, add the coordinates of that neighbor to the list created in step 3.\n7.  Iterate through all unique coordinates collected in the list from step 3.\n8.  For each coordinate `(r_change, c_change)` in this list, set the value of the corresponding cell in the *output* grid to 0.\n9.  The final output grid contains the transformed data."
