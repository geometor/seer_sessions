elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - content: single digits (0-9)
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - value: digit (0, 6, 9 are significant)
      - location: (row, column) coordinates
  - object: background
    represented_by:
      - cell value: 0
  - object: shape_component
    represented_by:
      - cell value: 9
  - object: marker
    represented_by:
      - cell value: 6
    relationship:
      - type: located_within_or_adjacent_to
        target: shape_component (9)
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: cells with value 6
  - action: identify
    target: cells with value 9 that are adjacent (up, down, left, right) to cells with value 6
  - action: replace_value
    target: identified cells (both original 6s and adjacent 9s)
    new_value: 0
  - action: copy_value
    target: all other cells (original 0s and 9s not adjacent to 6s)
    condition: cell value was not identified for replacement
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: cells (sharing an edge)
    relevance: determines which 9s are affected by a 6
