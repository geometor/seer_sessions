Input:
  Type: 2D Grid (List of Lists)
  Element Type: Integer (Single Digit)
  Properties:
    - Contains a dominant "background" digit.
    - Contains other "foreground" digits.
    - Some foreground digits act as "signal" digits.
    - Some foreground digits act as "noise" digits.
    - Dimensions vary.

Output:
  Type: 2D Grid (List of Lists)
  Element Type: Integer (Single Digit)
  Properties:
    - Composed of stacked 6x6 patterns.
    - Each 6x6 pattern uses the input's background digit and one signal digit.
    - The 6x6 patterns have a fixed, identical structure (a frame shape).
    - Width is consistently 6.
    - Height is `6 * number_of_signal_digits`.

Transformation:
  Actions:
    1. Identify Background Digit: Find the most frequent digit in the input grid.
    2. Identify Signal Digits:
       - Find all unique digits in the input grid that are not the background digit.
       - Filter these candidates: keep only those digits where at least one instance is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to another instance of the *same* digit. These are the signal digits.
    3. Sort Signal Digits: Arrange the identified signal digits in ascending numerical order.
    4. Generate Patterns: For each sorted signal digit:
       - Create a 6x6 grid.
       - Fill the grid with the background digit.
       - Overwrite specific cells with the current signal digit to form a fixed frame pattern:
         - Rows 0 & 5, Columns 0, 2, 3, 5
         - Rows 1 & 4, Columns 0, 1, 4, 5
         - Rows 2 & 3, Columns 0, 5
    5. Stack Patterns: Vertically concatenate the generated 6x6 patterns in the order determined by the sorted signal digits.
    6. Return Result: Output the final stacked grid.

Fixed Pattern Structure (6x6):
  - Uses Background (B) and Foreground (F = Signal Digit)
  - Layout:
