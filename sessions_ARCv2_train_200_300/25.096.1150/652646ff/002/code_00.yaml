  input_object:
    type: 2D grid
    description: A grid of single digits.
    properties:
      - Contains a dominant 'background' digit (most frequent).
      - Contains other 'foreground' digits scattered or clustered within.
      - Some foreground digits act as 'signals', others as 'noise'.
  output_object:
    type: 2D grid
    description: A grid composed of stacked 6x6 patterns.
    properties:
      - Width is always 6.
      - Height is 6 times the number of identified signal digits.
      - Each 6x6 pattern follows a fixed structure.

discernment:
  transformation_goal: >
    Identify specific 'signal' digits within the input grid based on adjacency properties,
    then construct and stack standardized 6x6 patterns for each signal digit.

  key_steps:
    - Identify the background digit (most frequent).
    - Identify all unique non-background digits.
    - Filter non-background digits to find 'signal' digits:
        - A digit is a signal if at least one instance of it in the grid is adjacent (including diagonals) to another instance of the same digit.
    - Sort the identified signal digits numerically.
    - For each sorted signal digit:
        - Generate a 6x6 pattern using the signal digit as foreground and the background digit.
        - The pattern structure is fixed: 8 foreground cells in a specific frame shape, 28 background cells.
    - Vertically stack the generated 6x6 patterns in the sorted order.

  pattern_details:
    background_digit_identification: Most frequent digit in the input grid.
    signal_digit_identification: Non-background digits where at least one instance has an identical neighbor (8 directions).
    noise_digit_identification: Non-background digits where no instance has an identical neighbor.
    output_pattern_structure:
      size: 6x6
      foreground_digit: The identified signal digit.
      background_digit: The identified background digit from the input.
      foreground_positions:
        - Rows 0 & 5: Columns 0, 2, 3, 5
        - Rows 1 & 4: Columns 0, 1, 4, 5
        - Rows 2 & 3: Columns 0, 5
      background_positions: All other cells within the 6x6 grid.
    output_assembly: Vertical stacking of generated patterns, ordered by the numerical value of the signal digits.
