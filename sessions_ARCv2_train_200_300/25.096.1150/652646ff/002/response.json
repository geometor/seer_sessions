            "text": "Okay, let's refine the understanding based on the execution results and the analysis.\n\n**General Assessment & Strategy**\n\nThe initial code failed because its core assumption \u2013 that the exact 6x6 output patterns exist as clean subgrids within the input \u2013 was incorrect. The code produced empty outputs because the `_is_valid_pattern` function never found a subgrid matching its strict criteria (exactly two digits - background and foreground, foreground count of 8, and specific placement).\n\nThe new analysis, confirmed by code execution metrics, reveals a different logic:\n1.  The input grid contains a background digit and several other digits.\n2.  Some non-background digits act as \"signals,\" while others are \"noise.\"\n3.  The crucial step is correctly identifying which digits are signals. The initial hypotheses (fixed noise set, count threshold) were insufficient.\n4.  The successful hypothesis is that signal digits exhibit *clustering* \u2013 at least one instance of a signal digit must be adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to another instance of the *same* digit. Noise digits appear isolated from digits of the same value.\n5.  Once the signal digits are identified, they are sorted, and for each one, a *standardized* 6x6 pattern is generated using that digit as foreground and the identified background digit. These generated patterns are then stacked vertically.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Implement the logic to identify the background digit.\n2.  Implement the logic to identify signal digits based on the self-adjacency criterion.\n3.  Retain the logic for sorting signal digits and constructing the standard 6x6 output patterns.\n4.  Update the natural language program and YAML facts accordingly.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nBased on the `tool_code` execution:\n\n| Example | Dimensions | Background | Non-Background Counts              | Signal (Self-Adjacent) | Noise (Not Self-Adjacent) | Expected Signal | Match |\n| :------ | :--------- | :--------- | :--------------------------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------ | :-------------- | :---- |\n| 1       | (20, 20)   | 2 (361)    | 4:12, 8:10, 3:10, 5:5, 9:2         | {3, 4, 8}              | {5, 9}                    | {3, 4, 8}       | Yes   |\n| 2       | (10, 10)   | 3 (67)     | 4:12, 1:10, 8:8, 5:3               | {1, 4, 8}              | {5}                       | {1, 4, 8}       | Yes   |\n| 3       | (13, 13)   | 4 (134)    | 3:10, 2:9, 8:9, 5:4, 7:3           | {2, 3, 8}              | {5, 7}                    | {2, 3, 8}       | Yes   |\n| 4       | (10, 10)   | 8 (74)     | 4:12, 3:10, 5:2, 2:2               | {3, 4}                 | {2, 5}                    | {3, 4}          | Yes   |\n\nThe self-adjacency criterion correctly identifies the signal digits in all training examples.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
