*   **Perception of Elements**:
    *   The input is a 2D grid of single digits.
    *   The output is also a 2D grid of single digits, generally smaller in height but potentially wider or narrower than the input depending on the specific task instance (though consistently 6 wide in the examples).
    *   There is a dominant "background" digit in each input grid (the most frequent one).
    *   Embedded within the input grid are patterns made of other "foreground" digits.
    *   The key patterns appear to occupy a 6x6 area and consist of a specific foreground digit arranged in a consistent "frame" shape (8 cells of the foreground digit, the rest being the background digit) within that 6x6 area.
    *   Some digits in the input seem to be "noise" and do not form part of the extracted patterns (e.g., 5, 7, 9 in various examples).
    *   The output grid is formed by stacking these identified 6x6 patterns vertically.
