objects:
  - id: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing the input and output state.
  - id: frame
    description: A rectangular boundary within the grid defined by cells with value 3.
    properties:
      - value: 3
      - location: Consistent across examples (rows 2-10, columns 3-11).
  - id: obstacle
    description: Cells with value 3 located inside the boundary defined by the frame.
    properties:
      - value: 3
      - location: Varies between examples, always within the frame boundary.
  - id: background
    description: Cells with value 0 located outside the frame boundary.
    properties:
      - value: 0
  - id: internal_empty_cell
    description: Cells with value 0 located inside the frame boundary in the input grid.
    properties:
      - value: 0
  - id: fill_cell_type_4
    description: Cells in the output grid corresponding to internal_empty_cells that are adjacent to a frame or obstacle cell.
    properties:
      - value: 4
  - id: fill_cell_type_2
    description: Cells in the output grid corresponding to internal_empty_cells that are not adjacent to any frame or obstacle cell.
    properties:
      - value: 2

relationships:
  - type: containment
    description: Obstacles and internal_empty_cells are contained within the frame.
  - type: adjacency
    description: Orthogonal adjacency (up, down, left, right) between cells. Key for determining fill value.
  - type: transformation
    description: internal_empty_cells are transformed into fill_cell_type_4 or fill_cell_type_2 based on adjacency to frame or obstacle cells.

actions:
  - id: identify_frame_region
    description: Determine the area enclosed by the outer frame of 3s.
  - id: check_adjacency
    description: For each internal_empty_cell, check its orthogonal neighbors in the input grid.
  - id: assign_value
    description: Assign 4 if adjacent to any 3, assign 2 otherwise.
  - id: copy_unmodified
    description: Copy background cells, frame cells, and obstacle cells directly from input to output.
