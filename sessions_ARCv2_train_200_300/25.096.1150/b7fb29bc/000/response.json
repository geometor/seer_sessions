The positions of these internal 3s vary between examples.\nThe output grid preserves the external 0s, the outer frame of 3s, and the internal obstacles (3s).\nThe transformation focuses on the cells within the outer frame that originally contained 0 in the input.\nThese internal 0s are replaced by either 2 or 4 in the output.\nThe value 4 is assigned to cells that were originally 0 but are orthogonally adjacent (sharing an edge) to any cell containing a 3 (either the outer frame or an internal obstacle).\nThe value 2 is assigned to cells that were originally 0 and are *not* orthogonally adjacent to any cell containing a 3.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
