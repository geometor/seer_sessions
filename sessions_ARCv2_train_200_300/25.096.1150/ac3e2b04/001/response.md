"""
Identifies connected regions of 0s in the input grid. 
For each region, it determines the values of the non-zero cells directly adjacent to it. 
If the adjacent non-zero values include both 2 and 3, the entire region of 0s is filled with 1s in the output grid. 
Cells with values 2 and 3 remain unchanged.
