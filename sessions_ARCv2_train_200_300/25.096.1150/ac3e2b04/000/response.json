The positions of the 2s and 3s remain unchanged.\n*   **Pattern:** The 1s appear in contiguous regions of 0s from the input. These regions seem to be \"bounded\" or \"enclosed\" in some way by the shapes formed by 2s and 3s. Specifically, the filled regions are those areas of 0s that are adjacent to *both* cells with value 2 and cells with value 3.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
