Data:
  Type: 2D Grid (List of Lists)
  Cell Values: [0, 1, 2, 3]

Objects:
  - Name: Grid
    Properties:
      - dimensions (rows, cols)
      - cells
  - Name: Cell
    Properties:
      - value (integer)
      - position (row, col)
  - Name: Region
    Properties:
      - type: Contiguous area of cells with value 0
      - connectivity: 4-way (N, S, E, W)
      - boundary_cells: Non-zero cells adjacent to the region
      - boundary_values: Set of unique values in boundary_cells

Shapes:
  - Name: Borders/Lines
    ComposedOf: Cells with value 2
    Arrangement: Typically horizontal or vertical lines
  - Name: Crosses
    ComposedOf: Cells with value 3 (sometimes including 2s)
    Arrangement: Cross-like patterns (3x3 with center potentially different)

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Cells sharing an edge.
  - Bounding: Non-zero cells (2s and 3s) adjacent to a region of 0s define its boundary.

Transformation:
  Action: Fill a region of 0s with 1s.
  Condition:
    - Input: Region of 0s.
    - Trigger: The set of values of the non-zero cells adjacent to the region must contain BOTH 2 AND 3.
  Input State: Cells in the region have value 0.
  Output State: Cells in the region have value 1.
  Invariant: Cells with values 2 and 3 remain unchanged.
