import collections

"""
Identifies connected regions of 0s in the input grid. 
For each region, it determines if the region touches the grid's outer border 
and finds the set of unique non-zero values adjacent to the region.
If a region does *not* touch the border AND its adjacent non-zero values 
include *both* 2 and 3, the entire region of 0s is filled with 1s 
in the output grid. 
Cells with values 2 and 3 remain unchanged. Other 0-regions remain 0.
