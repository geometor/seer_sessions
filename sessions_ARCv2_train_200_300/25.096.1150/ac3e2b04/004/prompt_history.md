Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of integers.
*   **Cell Values:** The grids contain specific integer values: 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    *   0 appears to be the background color.
    *   2 seems to form lines or borders (horizontal or vertical).
    *   3 seems to form cross-like shapes, sometimes including 2s within them.
    *   1 appears only in the output, replacing some of the 0s from the input.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing some 0 cells to 1. The positions of the 2s and 3s remain unchanged.
*   **Pattern:** The 1s appear in contiguous regions of 0s from the input. These regions seem to be "bounded" or "enclosed" in some way by the shapes formed by 2s and 3s. Specifically, the filled regions are those areas of 0s that are adjacent to *both* cells with value 2 and cells with value 3.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  Type: 2D Grid (List of Lists)
  Cell Values: [0, 1, 2, 3]

Objects:
  - Name: Grid
    Properties:
      - dimensions (rows, cols)
      - cells
  - Name: Cell
    Properties:
      - value (integer)
      - position (row, col)
  - Name: Region
    Properties:
      - type: Contiguous area of cells with value 0
      - connectivity: 4-way (N, S, E, W)
      - boundary_cells: Non-zero cells adjacent to the region
      - boundary_values: Set of unique values in boundary_cells

Shapes:
  - Name: Borders/Lines
    ComposedOf: Cells with value 2
    Arrangement: Typically horizontal or vertical lines
  - Name: Crosses
    ComposedOf: Cells with value 3 (sometimes including 2s)
    Arrangement: Cross-like patterns (3x3 with center potentially different)

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Cells sharing an edge.
  - Bounding: Non-zero cells (2s and 3s) adjacent to a region of 0s define its boundary.

Transformation:
  Action: Fill a region of 0s with 1s.
  Condition:
    - Input: Region of 0s.
    - Trigger: The set of values of the non-zero cells adjacent to the region must contain BOTH 2 AND 3.
  Input State: Cells in the region have value 0.
  Output State: Cells in the region have value 1.
  Invariant: Cells with values 2 and 3 remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  **Identify Regions:** Find all distinct, connected regions of cells containing the value 0 in the input grid. Consider cells connected if they share an edge (up, down, left, or right).
3.  **Analyze Boundaries:** For each identified region of 0s:
    a.  Determine the set of all non-zero cells that are directly adjacent (share an edge) to any cell within that region. These are the boundary cells.
    b.  Extract the unique values present in these boundary cells.
    c.  Check if this set of unique boundary values includes *both* the value 2 and the value 3.
4.  **Fill Regions:** If a region's boundary values contain both 2 and 3, then change the value of every cell within that specific region from 0 to 1 in the output grid.
5.  **Return:** The final modified grid is the result.
