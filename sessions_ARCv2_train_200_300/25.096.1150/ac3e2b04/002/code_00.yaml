Data:
  Type: 2D Grid (List of Lists)
  Cell Values: [0, 1, 2, 3]
  Value Semantics:
    - 0: Background / Empty space
    - 1: Filled space (output only)
    - 2: Barrier type 1 (often lines)
    - 3: Barrier type 2 (often crosses/clusters)

Objects:
  - Name: Grid
    Properties:
      - dimensions (rows, cols)
      - cells
  - Name: Cell
    Properties:
      - value (integer: 0, 1, 2, 3)
      - position (row, col)
  - Name: Region
    Properties:
      - type: Contiguous area of cells with the same value (primarily focusing on 0-value regions)
      - connectivity: 4-way (N, S, E, W)
  - Name: Boundary
    Properties:
      - type: Set of non-zero cells adjacent to a specific 0-value region.
      - values: Set of unique values {2, 3} present in the boundary cells.
  - Name: EdgeConnectivity
    Properties:
      - type: Boolean flag indicating if a 0-value region contains any cell on the grid's outer border.

TransformationRule:
  InputCondition: Cell has value 0.
  OutputCondition: Cell value becomes 1.
  Trigger:
    - The cell belongs to a connected region of 0s.
    - The set of unique non-zero values adjacent to *any* cell in this region contains BOTH 2 AND 3.
    - This specific connected region of 0s is 'enclosed', meaning it does NOT have any cell directly on the outer border (row 0, last row, col 0, last col) of the grid.
  Invariant: Cells with values 2 and 3 remain unchanged.

Refined_Understanding:
  - The 'connected region' definition used by the initial BFS was too broad. It appears the 'enclosed' property is critical. A region of 0s must be fully surrounded by non-zero cells (specifically requiring both 2s and 3s among them) without any path of 0s leading to the grid edge.
