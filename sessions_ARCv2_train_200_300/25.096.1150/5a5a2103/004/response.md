**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code attempted to fill all non-separator cells within a horizontal strip with the source color found in the leftmost quadrant. The comparison between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` clearly shows this was incorrect. The `Transformed Output` overfilled regions, changing background cells (`0`) that should have remained background.

The key insight gained from analyzing the discrepancies is that the transformation targets only the *existing non-background, non-separator* cells within a strip. These target cells are then recolored using the `source_color` identified from the leftmost quadrant of that strip. Cells that are originally background (`0`) or part of a separator line remain unchanged.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm grid properties (dimensions, separator colors, source colors) using code execution.
2.  Update the YAML fact document to reflect the revised understanding of the elements and actions, particularly how the `source_color` is applied.
3.  Revise the natural language program to accurately describe the process: find the source color per strip, then iterate through the strip, changing only the cells that were originally *neither* background nor separator to the `source_color`.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's verify the properties for each example.
