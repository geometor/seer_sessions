            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code attempted to fill all non-separator cells within a horizontal strip with the source color found in the leftmost quadrant. The comparison between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` clearly shows this was incorrect. The `Transformed Output` overfilled regions, changing background cells (`0`) that should have remained background.\n\nThe key insight gained from analyzing the discrepancies is that the transformation targets only the *existing non-background, non-separator* cells within a strip. These target cells are then recolored using the `source_color` identified from the leftmost quadrant of that strip. Cells that are originally background (`0`) or part of a separator line remain unchanged.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm grid properties (dimensions, separator colors, source colors) using code execution.\n2.  Update the YAML fact document to reflect the revised understanding of the elements and actions, particularly how the `source_color` is applied.\n3.  Revise the natural language program to accurately describe the process: find the source color per strip, then iterate through the strip, changing only the cells that were originally *neither* background nor separator to the `source_color`.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's verify the properties for each example.\n\n"
