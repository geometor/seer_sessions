task_description: "Fill regions of a grid defined by separator lines. For each horizontal strip between horizontal separators, find the first non-background, non-separator color in the leftmost region (quadrant) of that strip. Use this color to fill all non-separator cells across the entire horizontal strip."
elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - represents: colored cells
  - object: separator_lines
    properties:
      - type: horizontal and vertical lines
      - composition: composed of a single, non-zero 'separator_color' that forms complete rows and columns.
      - function: divide the grid into rectangular 'quadrants'
  - object: background
    properties:
      - color_value: 0
      - role: empty space within quadrants, ignored when searching for source color.
  - object: content_pixels
    properties:
      - type: non-zero, non-separator colored cells
      - location: within quadrants
      - role: potential source colors for filling
  - object: horizontal_strips
    properties:
      - type: horizontal rectangular regions of the grid located *between* consecutive horizontal separator lines (or between a grid edge and the nearest horizontal separator).
      - excludes: the separator lines themselves.
  - object: leftmost_quadrant
    properties:
      - type: rectangular subgrid within a horizontal_strip
      - location: occupies the full height of its strip and extends horizontally from the left grid edge (column 0) to the first vertical separator line (or the right grid edge if no vertical separators exist).
      - function: scanned to find the 'source_color' for its strip.
