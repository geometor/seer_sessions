            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both inputs and outputs are 2D grids of integers representing colors.\n2.  **Separator Lines:** There are distinct horizontal and vertical lines composed of a single color (color `8` in train\\_1, color `3` in train\\_2). These lines divide the grid into smaller rectangular regions or \"quadrants\".\n3.  **Background Color:** The color `0` acts as a background or empty space.\n4.  **Content Colors:** Within the quadrants defined by the separator lines, there are other non-zero colors (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`, `5` in train\\_1; `1`, `2`, `4`, `6`, `8` in train\\_2). These often appear as small blocks or individual pixels.\n5.  **Transformation Goal:** The transformation fills the non-separator areas of the grid. The fill color for a horizontal \"strip\" of quadrants seems determined by a specific color found within the leftmost quadrant of that strip.\n6.  **Color Propagation:** The color found in the leftmost quadrant of a horizontal strip (between two horizontal separator lines) propagates horizontally across that entire strip, overwriting any background (`0`) or other content colors (`5`, `6` in the examples) within that strip, but stopping at the vertical separator lines.\n7.  **Separator Preservation:** The separator lines (horizontal and vertical) remain unchanged in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

Scan the cells within this leftmost quadrant (e.g., row by row, then column by column). Find the first cell whose color is not the background color (`0`) and not the `separator_color`. Store this color as the `source_color` for the current strip. If no such color is found, the strip might remain unchanged or filled with background (the examples suggest a source color is always found).\n    d.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` within the row range of the current strip.\n    e.  If the cell `(r, c)` in the input grid does *not* contain the `separator_color`, update the corresponding cell `(r, c)` in the output grid with the determined `source_color`.\n5.
