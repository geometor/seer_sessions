task_description: "Fill regions of a grid based on a color found in the leftmost region of each horizontal strip."
elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - represents: colored cells
  - object: separator_lines
    properties:
      - type: horizontal and vertical lines
      - composition: composed of a single, non-zero 'separator_color'
      - function: divide the grid into rectangular 'quadrants'
  - object: background
    properties:
      - color_value: 0
      - role: empty space within quadrants
  - object: content_pixels
    properties:
      - type: non-zero, non-separator colored cells
      - location: within quadrants
      - role: potential source colors for filling
  - object: quadrants
    properties:
      - type: rectangular subgrids
      - boundaries: defined by separator lines or grid edges
  - object: horizontal_strips
    properties:
      - type: collection of quadrants aligned horizontally between two horizontal separator lines (or grid edge)
