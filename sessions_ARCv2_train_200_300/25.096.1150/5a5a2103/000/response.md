Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both inputs and outputs are 2D grids of integers representing colors.
2.  **Separator Lines:** There are distinct horizontal and vertical lines composed of a single color (color `8` in train\_1, color `3` in train\_2). These lines divide the grid into smaller rectangular regions or "quadrants".
3.  **Background Color:** The color `0` acts as a background or empty space.
4.  **Content Colors:** Within the quadrants defined by the separator lines, there are other non-zero colors (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`, `5` in train\_1; `1`, `2`, `4`, `6`, `8` in train\_2). These often appear as small blocks or individual pixels.
5.  **Transformation Goal:** The transformation fills the non-separator areas of the grid. The fill color for a horizontal "strip" of quadrants seems determined by a specific color found within the leftmost quadrant of that strip.
6.  **Color Propagation:** The color found in the leftmost quadrant of a horizontal strip (between two horizontal separator lines) propagates horizontally across that entire strip, overwriting any background (`0`) or other content colors (`5`, `6` in the examples) within that strip, but stopping at the vertical separator lines.
7.  **Separator Preservation:** The separator lines (horizontal and vertical) remain unchanged in the output.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the `separator_color` by finding the color that forms solid horizontal and vertical lines spanning the grid dimensions.
3.  Identify the row indices of the horizontal separator lines and the column indices of the vertical separator lines.
4.  Iterate through the horizontal "strips" defined by consecutive horizontal separator lines (or grid edges). For each strip:
    a.  Determine the row range of the current strip.
    b.  Identify the first (leftmost) quadrant within this strip (columns from the start up to the first vertical separator line, or the full width if no vertical separators exist).
    c.  Scan the cells within this leftmost quadrant (e.g., row by row, then column by column). Find the first cell whose color is not the background color (`0`) and not the `separator_color`. Store this color as the `source_color` for the current strip. If no such color is found, the strip might remain unchanged or filled with background (the examples suggest a source color is always found).
    d.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` within the row range of the current strip.
    e.  If the cell `(r, c)` in the input grid does *not* contain the `separator_color`, update the corresponding cell `(r, c)` in the output grid with the determined `source_color`.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
