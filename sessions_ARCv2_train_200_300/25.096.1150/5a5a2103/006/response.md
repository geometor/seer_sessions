**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code implementation failed because it incorrectly applied the filling logic. The analysis revealed that the transformation should fill *all* non-separator cells within a horizontal strip with the determined source color, including cells originally containing the background color (0). The previous logic only overwrote cells that already had a non-zero, non-separator color.

The metrics gathered confirmed this analysis, showing that the majority of pixel errors occurred on cells that were originally background (0) and should have been filled according to the expected output.

The strategy is to revise the Natural Language Program to accurately reflect this "fill-all-non-separators" rule within each strip and ensure the subsequent code implements this corrected logic.

**Metrics:**

    *   Input Shape: (14, 14)
    *   Output Shape: (14, 14)
    *   Separator Color: 8
    *   Pixels Incorrect (Previous Code): 58
    *   Incorrect Pixels Originally Background (0): 55
    *   Incorrect Pixels Originally Content (non-0, non-8): 3
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (19, 19)
    *   Output Shape: (19, 19)
    *   Separator Color: 3
    *   Pixels Incorrect (Previous Code): 82
    *   Incorrect Pixels Originally Background (0): 78
    *   Incorrect Pixels Originally Content (non-0, non-3): 4

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an `output_grid` as a direct copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Identify the `separator_color` by finding the unique non-zero integer that constitutes complete rows *and* complete columns in the `input_grid`. If no such unique color is found, return the original `input_grid`.
3.  Identify the row indices of all horizontal lines composed entirely of the `separator_color` (`h_lines`).
4.  Identify the column indices of all vertical lines composed entirely of the `separator_color` (`v_lines`).
5.  Define horizontal strip boundaries by creating a sorted list containing 0, all indices in `h_lines`, and the total number of rows in the grid.
6.  Iterate through each pair of consecutive boundaries `(strip_start_row, strip_end_row)` from the list in step 5. These define a horizontal strip.
7.  Determine the content rows for the current strip:
    *   Set `content_start_row` to `strip_start_row + 1` if `strip_start_row` is in `h_lines`, otherwise set it to `strip_start_row`.
    *   The content rows range from `content_start_row` up to (but not including) `strip_end_row`.
    *   If `content_start_row` is greater than or equal to `strip_end_row`, this strip contains no content (it's purely a separator line or an empty gap), so continue to the next strip.
8.  Determine the column boundary for the leftmost quadrant:
    *   Set `leftmost_quadrant_col_end` to the grid width.
    *   Iterate through the sorted `v_lines`. If a `v_line_idx` is found where `v_line_idx >= 0`, set `leftmost_quadrant_col_end` to `v_line_idx` and stop this inner iteration.
9.  Find the `source_color` for the current strip:
    *   Iterate through the cells `(r, c)` of the `input_grid` where `r` ranges from `content_start_row` to `strip_end_row` (exclusive) and `c` ranges from 0 to `leftmost_quadrant_col_end` (exclusive).
    *   The first cell encountered whose color is *not* equal to the `background_color` (0) and *not* equal to the `separator_color` provides the `source_color`.
    *   If no such color is found within the leftmost quadrant, store `None` as the `source_color` and continue to the next strip (no filling occurs for this strip).
10. Fill the current strip in the `output_grid`:
    *   If a valid `source_color` was found in step 9:
        *   Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` where `r` ranges from `content_start_row` to `strip_end_row` (exclusive) and `c` ranges from 0 to the grid width (exclusive).
        *   Check the color in the original `input_grid` at `(r, c)`.
        *   If `input_grid[r, c]` is *not* equal to the `separator_color`, then update the corresponding cell in the `output_grid`: `output_grid[r, c] = source_color`.
        *   (If `input_grid[r, c]` *is* the `separator_color`, the `output_grid` cell remains unchanged due to the initial copy).
11. After iterating through all strips, return the modified `output_grid`.
