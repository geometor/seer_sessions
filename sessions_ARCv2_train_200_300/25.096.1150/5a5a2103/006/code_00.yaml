task_description: "Fill regions of a grid based on a color found in the leftmost region of each horizontal strip, preserving separator lines."
elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - represents: colored cells
  - object: separator_lines
    properties:
      - type: horizontal and vertical lines
      - composition: composed of a single, non-zero 'separator_color'
      - function: divide the grid into rectangular 'quadrants' and define 'strips'
      - persistence: separator lines remain unchanged in the output
  - object: background
    properties:
      - color_value: 0
      - role: empty space, subject to being filled by a 'source_color'
  - object: content_pixels
    properties:
      - type: non-zero, non-separator colored cells
      - location: within quadrants/strips
      - role: 
        - potential 'source_color' when located in the leftmost quadrant of a strip
        - subject to being overwritten by the 'source_color' when located elsewhere in the strip
  - object: quadrants
    properties:
      - type: rectangular subgrids
      - boundaries: defined by separator lines or grid edges
      - role: specifically, the leftmost quadrant in a strip determines the fill color for that strip
  - object: horizontal_strips
    properties:
      - type: set of rows between horizontal separator lines (or grid edges)
      - boundaries: defined by horizontal separator lines or grid top/bottom edges
      - composition: contains background, content_pixels, and potentially parts of vertical separator lines
      - scope: filling action applies to the entire width of the strip's content rows
actions:
  - action: identify_separator_color
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [separator_color]
    description: "Find the unique non-zero color that forms complete horizontal and vertical lines spanning the grid."
  - action: identify_separator_line_indices
    inputs: [input_grid, separator_color]
    outputs: [horizontal_line_rows, vertical_line_cols]
    description: "Find the row indices of horizontal separator lines and column indices of vertical separator lines."
  - action: define_horizontal_strips
    inputs: [grid_height, horizontal_line_rows]
    outputs: [list_of_strip_row_ranges]
    description: "Determine the start and end row indices for each horizontal strip based on horizontal separator lines and grid edges."
  - action: find_source_color_for_strip
    inputs: [input_grid, strip_row_range, vertical_line_cols, separator_color, background_color=0]
    outputs: [source_color]
    description: "Scan the leftmost quadrant (from column 0 up to the first vertical separator or grid edge) within the strip's content rows. Find the first cell whose color is not background (0) and not separator_color. Return this color, or None if none found."
  - action: fill_strip
    inputs: [output_grid, input_grid, strip_row_range, source_color, separator_color]
    outputs: [modified_output_grid]
    description: "Iterate through all cells (r, c) within the strip's content row range (full width). If the corresponding input grid cell input_grid[r, c] is *not* the separator_color, set the output grid cell output_grid[r, c] to the source_color. Otherwise (if it is the separator color), leave the output cell unchanged (preserving the separator)."
