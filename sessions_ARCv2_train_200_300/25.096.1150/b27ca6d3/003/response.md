"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rules:
1. Cells that contain the value 2 in the input grid retain the value 2 in the output grid.
2. Cells that contain the value 0 in the input grid are changed to 3 in the output grid if, and only if, they have at least one neighboring cell (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) with the value 2, AND that neighboring '2' cell itself has at least one other neighbor with the value 2 (excluding the original '0' cell being considered).
3. Cells that contain the value 0 in the input grid and do not meet the condition in rule 2 remain 0 in the output grid.
