"""
Transforms an input grid based on the proximity of cells with value 0 to cells with value 2.

1. Cells with value 2 in the input grid remain 2 in the output grid.
2. Cells with value 0 in the input grid become 3 in the output grid if they have at least one neighbor (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) with value 2 in the input grid.
3. Cells with value 0 in the input grid that do not have any neighbors with value 2 remain 0 in the output grid.
