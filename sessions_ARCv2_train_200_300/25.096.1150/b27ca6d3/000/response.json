The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid and contains the numbers 0, 2, and 3.\n\nBy comparing the input and output grids in the provided examples, the transformation rule appears to be based on the neighborhood of cells containing the value 2. Specifically:\n\n1.  Cells that contain the value 2 in the input grid retain the value 2 in the output grid.\n2.  Cells that contain the value 0 in the input grid are changed to 3 in the output grid if, and only if, at least one of their eight neighboring cells (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent) in the input grid contains the value 2.\n3.  Cells that contain the value 0 in the input grid and do not have any neighbors with the value 2 remain 0 in the output grid.\n\nEssentially, the transformation \"marks\" the cells adjacent to the '2' cells with a '3', provided those adjacent cells were originally '0'.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
