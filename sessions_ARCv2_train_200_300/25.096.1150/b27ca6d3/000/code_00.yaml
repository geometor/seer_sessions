Objects:
  - Input_Grid: A 2D array representing the initial state.
  - Output_Grid: A 2D array representing the final state, derived from Input_Grid.
  - Cell: An individual element within a grid, defined by its row, column, and value.

Properties:
  - Grid:
    - dimensions: height (number of rows), width (number of columns)
    - cells: A collection of Cell objects.
  - Cell:
    - row: Integer index for the row position.
    - column: Integer index for the column position.
    - value: Integer value (0, 2 in Input_Grid; 0, 2, 3 in Output_Grid).
  - Neighborhood:
    - type: Moore neighborhood (8 adjacent cells including diagonals).
    - context: Defined relative to a central Cell within the Input_Grid.

Relationships:
  - Output_Grid is derived from Input_Grid.
  - The value of a Cell in Output_Grid depends on the value of the corresponding Cell in Input_Grid and the values of its neighboring Cells in Input_Grid.
  - A Cell value of 3 in Output_Grid indicates that the corresponding Input_Grid Cell had a value of 0 and was adjacent (neighbor) to at least one Cell with a value of 2 in the Input_Grid.

Actions:
  - Iterate through each Cell (r, c) of the Input_Grid.
  - Determine the value for the corresponding Cell (r, c) in the Output_Grid based on the following rules:
    - If Input_Grid[r][c] is 2, then Output_Grid[r][c] is 2.
    - If Input_Grid[r][c] is 0:
      - Check all 8 neighbors (nr, nc) of Cell (r, c) in the Input_Grid.
      - If any neighbor Input_Grid[nr][nc] exists and has a value of 2, then Output_Grid[r][c] is 3.
      - Otherwise (if no neighbor has a value of 2), Output_Grid[r][c] is 0.
