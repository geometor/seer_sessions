"""
Identifies two distinct blue shapes in the input grid. 
For each shape, finds the coordinates of the unique black pixel (0) located within the minimal bounding box of the blue pixels of that shape. These two black pixel coordinates serve as anchor points.
Determines the rectangular region defined by these two anchor points as diagonal corners.
Fills this rectangular region in the output grid: if a pixel within the region was black (0) in the input, it becomes red (4) in the output. All other pixels (including the original blue/green shapes and pixels outside the rectangle) retain their original colors.
