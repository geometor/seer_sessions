These points seem to be the single black (0) pixels located *within* the immediate 3x3 bounding box defined by each blue shape.\n    *   A rectangular area is defined using these two identified black pixels as diagonal corners.\n    *   Within this rectangular area, all black (0) pixels from the input grid are changed to red (4) in the output grid.\n    *   Pixels that were originally blue (2) or green (5) within this rectangle remain unchanged.\n    *   Pixels outside this rectangle remain unchanged.\n\n## YAML Fact Documentation:\n\n"
