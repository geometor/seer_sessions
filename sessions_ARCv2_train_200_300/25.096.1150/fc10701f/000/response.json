            "text": "## Perception\n\nThe task involves transforming a 2D grid of digits based on specific rules applied to individual cells. The grids are primarily composed of the digit '6', which acts as a background color. Other significant digits are '0', '7', and '9'. The transformation introduces a new digit, '2'.\n\nThe transformation appears to involve three distinct and independent rules applied simultaneously to each cell based on the input grid's state:\n1.  Cells containing '9' are changed to '7'.\n2.  Cells containing '7' are changed to '6'.\n3.  Cells containing '6' are changed to '2' under specific contextual conditions related to neighboring '0's. A '6' changes to '2' if it lies on a direct path (horizontal or vertical) between two '0's, where the path consists only of '6's apart from the endpoint '0's.\n\nThe relative positions of '0's determine whether the '6'-to-'2' transformation occurs. In some examples, pairs of '0's are arranged horizontally (`0 0 ... 6 6 ... 0 0`), causing the intermediate '6's in that row to become '2'. In other examples, the '0's are arranged vertically (`0 ... 6 ... 0`), causing the intermediate '6' in that column to become '2'.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
