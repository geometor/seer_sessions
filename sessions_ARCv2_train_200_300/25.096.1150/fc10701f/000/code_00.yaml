task_elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of single digits.
    properties:
      - rows: Integer number of rows.
      - columns: Integer number of columns.
      - cells: Contains individual digit values.
  - object: cell
    description: An individual element within the grid.
    properties:
      - value: The digit contained in the cell (e.g., 0, 2, 6, 7, 9).
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
      - neighbors: Adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).
      - context: Surrounding cells in the same row or column, particularly '0's.

transformation_rules:
  - rule: direct_replacement_9_to_7
    description: Any cell containing the digit '9' in the input grid is replaced with '7' in the output grid.
    input_value: 9
    output_value: 7
  - rule: direct_replacement_7_to_6
    description: Any cell containing the digit '7' in the input grid is replaced with '6' in the output grid.
    input_value: 7
    output_value: 6
  - rule: conditional_replacement_6_to_2
    description: A cell containing '6' in the input grid is replaced with '2' if it satisfies the 'betweenness' condition.
    input_value: 6
    output_value: 2
    condition:
      - type: horizontal_betweenness
        description: >
          The cell at (r, c) contains '6', AND there exists a column c_left < c such that the cell (r, c_left) contains '0',
          AND there exists a column c_right > c such that the cell (r, c_right) contains '0',
          AND all cells (r, k) for c_left < k < c_right contain '6' in the input grid.
      - type: vertical_betweenness
        description: >
          The cell at (r, c) contains '6', AND there exists a row r_up < r such that the cell (r_up, c) contains '0',
          AND there exists a row r_down > r such that the cell (r_down, c) contains '0',
          AND all cells (k, c) for r_up < k < r_down contain '6' in the input grid.
    condition_logic: The cell must satisfy EITHER horizontal_betweenness OR vertical_betweenness.
  - rule: default_copy
    description: If none of the above rules apply to a cell, its value remains unchanged from input to output.

processing_order:
  - All rules are evaluated based on the original input grid state.
  - The output grid is constructed based on the results of these evaluations.
