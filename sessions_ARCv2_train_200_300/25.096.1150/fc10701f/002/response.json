            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe analysis of the execution results reveals that the initial natural language program and corresponding code correctly identified the basic transformation rules (9->7, 7->6) and the mechanism for the 6->2 change (being horizontally or vertically between two 0s with only 6s in between). However, the code failed because it applied the 6->2 rule too liberally.\n\nThe key insight from comparing the expected outputs with the code's outputs is that the 6->2 transformation is subject to an *additional spatial constraint*. It appears that a '6' only transforms to a '2' if it meets the \"between 0s\" condition *and* its location `(r, c)` falls within the bounding box defined by the initial positions of all '7's and '9's in the input grid.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the natural language program and the subsequent code implementation by adding this bounding box check as a prerequisite for applying the \"between 0s\" logic for the 6->2 transformation.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the tool execution and analysis:\n\n1.  **Input/Output Parsing:** Input and expected output grids were successfully parsed for all examples.\n2.  **Digit Location Finding:** Locations of '7's and '9's in each input grid were correctly identified.\n    *   Example 1: 7s at [(10, 6), (10, 7), (11, 6), (11, 7)], 9s at [(1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 6), (2, 7)].\n    *   Example 2: 7s at [(4, 1)], 9s at [(4, 7)].\n    *   Example 3: 7s at [(7, 12), (7, 13), (8, 12), (8, 13)], 9s at [(7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 4), (8, 5)].\n3.  **Bounding Box Calculation:** The combined bounding box enclosing all input '7's and '9's was computed for each example.\n    *   Example 1: Rows 1-11, Cols 6-7.\n    *   Example 2: Row 4, Cols 1-7.\n    *   Example 3: Rows 7-8, Cols 4-13.\n4.  **Condition Verification:** For every cell `(r, c)` that changed from '6' in the input to '2' in the *expected output*, the analysis verified that:\n    *   The cell `(r, c)` satisfied the \"between 0s\" condition (either horizontally or vertically) based on the input grid.\n    *   The cell `(r, c)` was located within the combined bounding box calculated in step 3.\n    *   Crucially, **zero** failures were found (`failed_conditions` list is empty for all examples). This confirms that all expected 6->2 changes adhere to *both* the local \"between 0s\" rule and the global bounding box constraint.\n5.  **Error Explanation:** The errors in the previous code stemmed from applying the \"between 0s\" rule to '6's located *outside* the combined bounding box, which should have remained '6'.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Scan the entire input grid to find the coordinates of all cells containing the digit '7' and all cells containing the digit '9'.\n    b.  If at least one '7' or '9' was found: Calculate the minimum row (`min_r`), maximum row (`max_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), and maximum column (`max_c`) encompassing all found '7' and '9' coordinates. Store these four boundary values. Note that a bounding box exists.\n    c.  If no '7's or '9's were found in the input grid, note that the bounding box constraint does not apply.\n2.  **Initialization:** Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, making it an exact copy of the input grid initially.\n3.  **Cell Transformation Loop:** Process each cell at position `(r, c)` in the grid:\n    a.  Retrieve the value (`input_value`) from the cell `(r, c)` of the *original input grid*.\n    b.  **Rule 1 (9 to 7):** If `input_value` is '9', change the value of the cell `(r, c)` in the *output grid* to '7'.\n    c.  **Rule 2 (7 to 6):** Else if `input_value` is '7', change the value of the cell `(r, c)` in the *output grid* to '6'.\n    d.  **Rule 3 (Conditional 6 to 2):** Else if `input_value` is '6':\n        i.  **Check Bounding Box:** Determine if the current cell `(r, c)` falls within the spatial constraint defined in step 1. This means checking if a bounding box exists AND if `r` is between `min_r` and `max_r` (inclusive) AND `c` is between `min_c` and `max_c` (inclusive). If no bounding box exists, this check automatically passes.\n        ii. **Check Local Context (if Bounding Box check passed):** If the bounding box check passed, then check if the cell `(r, c)` is locally situated between two '0's in the *input grid*:\n            1.  Check horizontally: Is there a '0' at `(r, c_left)` with `c_left < c` AND a '0' at `(r, c_right)` with `c_right > c`, such that all cells `(r, k)` for `c_left < k < c_right` contain only '6's in the input grid?\n            2.  Check vertically: Is there a '0' at `(r_up, c)` with `r_up < r` AND a '0' at `(r_down, c)` with `r_down > r`, such that all cells `(k, c)` for `r_up < k < r_down` contain only '6's in the input grid?\n        iii. **Apply Change:** If the Bounding Box check passed AND (the horizontal check OR the vertical check succeeded), change the value of cell `(r, c)` in the *output grid* to '2'.\n        iv. **No Change for 6:** Otherwise (if the input was '6' but it failed either the Bounding Box check or both local context checks), the value at `(r, c)` in the output grid remains '6' (as initially copied).\n    e.  **Rule 4 (Default Copy):** Else (if `input_value` is '0' or any other digit not explicitly handled), the value at `(r, c)` in the output grid remains unchanged from the initial copy.\n4.  **Finalization:** After processing all cells, return the completed output grid."
