"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules applied simultaneously using the input state:
1. Pre-computation: Identify the bounding box enclosing all initial '7's and '9's.
2. Rule 9->7: Cells with '9' become '7'.
3. Rule 7->6: Cells with '7' become '6'.
4. Rule 6->2 (Conditional): Cells with '6' become '2' ONLY IF:
   a) They fall within the pre-computed bounding box (if one exists).
   b) They are horizontally or vertically positioned between two '0's, with only '6's along the direct path between the '0's (excluding the '0's themselves).
5. Default Copy: All other cells retain their original value.
