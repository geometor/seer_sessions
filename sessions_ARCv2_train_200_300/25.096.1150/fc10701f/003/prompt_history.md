## Perception

The task involves transforming a 2D grid of digits based on specific rules applied to individual cells. The grids are primarily composed of the digit '6', which acts as a background color. Other significant digits are '0', '7', and '9'. The transformation introduces a new digit, '2'.

The transformation appears to involve three distinct and independent rules applied simultaneously to each cell based on the input grid's state:
1.  Cells containing '9' are changed to '7'.
2.  Cells containing '7' are changed to '6'.
3.  Cells containing '6' are changed to '2' under specific contextual conditions related to neighboring '0's. A '6' changes to '2' if it lies on a direct path (horizontal or vertical) between two '0's, where the path consists only of '6's apart from the endpoint '0's.

The relative positions of '0's determine whether the '6'-to-'2' transformation occurs. In some examples, pairs of '0's are arranged horizontally (`0 0 ... 6 6 ... 0 0`), causing the intermediate '6's in that row to become '2'. In other examples, the '0's are arranged vertically (`0 ... 6 ... 0`), causing the intermediate '6' in that column to become '2'.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the input grid.
3.  For the current cell (r, c), determine its output value based on the following prioritized rules, evaluated using the *input* grid values:
    a.  If the input cell value is '9', set the corresponding output cell value to '7'.
    b.  Else if the input cell value is '7', set the corresponding output cell value to '6'.
    c.  Else if the input cell value is '6':
        i.  Check for horizontal 'betweenness': Scan leftwards from (r, c-1) to find the nearest '0' at (r, c_left). Scan rightwards from (r, c+1) to find the nearest '0' at (r, c_right). If both are found AND all cells between (r, c_left) and (r, c_right) (exclusive) contain only '6's in the input grid, then set the output cell value to '2'.
        ii. Check for vertical 'betweenness': Scan upwards from (r-1, c) to find the nearest '0' at (r_up, c). Scan downwards from (r+1, c) to find the nearest '0' at (r_down, c). If both are found AND all cells between (r_up, c) and (r_down, c) (exclusive) contain only '6's in the input grid, then set the output cell value to '2'.
        iii. If the cell is '6' but neither the horizontal nor vertical 'betweenness' condition is met, set the corresponding output cell value to '6'.
    d.  Else (if the input cell value is '0' or any other value not covered above), copy the input cell value to the corresponding output cell.
4.  Return the completed output grid.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The analysis of the execution results reveals that the initial natural language program and corresponding code correctly identified the basic transformation rules (9->7, 7->6) and the mechanism for the 6->2 change (being horizontally or vertically between two 0s with only 6s in between). However, the code failed because it applied the 6->2 rule too liberally.

The key insight from comparing the expected outputs with the code's outputs is that the 6->2 transformation is subject to an *additional spatial constraint*. It appears that a '6' only transforms to a '2' if it meets the "between 0s" condition *and* its location `(r, c)` falls within the bounding box defined by the initial positions of all '7's and '9's in the input grid.

The strategy is to refine the natural language program and the subsequent code implementation by adding this bounding box check as a prerequisite for applying the "between 0s" logic for the 6->2 transformation.

## Metrics

Based on the tool execution and analysis:

1.  **Input/Output Parsing:** Input and expected output grids were successfully parsed for all examples.
2.  **Digit Location Finding:** Locations of '7's and '9's in each input grid were correctly identified.
    *   Example 1: 7s at [(10, 6), (10, 7), (11, 6), (11, 7)], 9s at [(1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 6), (2, 7)].
    *   Example 2: 7s at [(4, 1)], 9s at [(4, 7)].
    *   Example 3: 7s at [(7, 12), (7, 13), (8, 12), (8, 13)], 9s at [(7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 4), (8, 5)].
3.  **Bounding Box Calculation:** The combined bounding box enclosing all input '7's and '9's was computed for each example.
    *   Example 1: Rows 1-11, Cols 6-7.
    *   Example 2: Row 4, Cols 1-7.
    *   Example 3: Rows 7-8, Cols 4-13.
4.  **Condition Verification:** For every cell `(r, c)` that changed from '6' in the input to '2' in the *expected output*, the analysis verified that:
    *   The cell `(r, c)` satisfied the "between 0s" condition (either horizontally or vertically) based on the input grid.
    *   The cell `(r, c)` was located within the combined bounding box calculated in step 3.
    *   Crucially, **zero** failures were found (`failed_conditions` list is empty for all examples). This confirms that all expected 6->2 changes adhere to *both* the local "between 0s" rule and the global bounding box constraint.
5.  **Error Explanation:** The errors in the previous code stemmed from applying the "between 0s" rule to '6's located *outside* the combined bounding box, which should have remained '6'.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Preprocessing: Determine Spatial Constraint:**
    a.  Scan the entire input grid to find the coordinates of all cells containing the digit '7' and all cells containing the digit '9'.
    b.  If at least one '7' or '9' was found: Calculate the minimum row (`min_r`), maximum row (`max_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), and maximum column (`max_c`) encompassing all found '7' and '9' coordinates. Store these four boundary values. Note that a bounding box exists.
    c.  If no '7's or '9's were found in the input grid, note that the bounding box constraint does not apply.
2.  **Initialization:** Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, making it an exact copy of the input grid initially.
3.  **Cell Transformation Loop:** Process each cell at position `(r, c)` in the grid:
    a.  Retrieve the value (`input_value`) from the cell `(r, c)` of the *original input grid*.
    b.  **Rule 1 (9 to 7):** If `input_value` is '9', change the value of the cell `(r, c)` in the *output grid* to '7'.
    c.  **Rule 2 (7 to 6):** Else if `input_value` is '7', change the value of the cell `(r, c)` in the *output grid* to '6'.
    d.  **Rule 3 (Conditional 6 to 2):** Else if `input_value` is '6':
        i.  **Check Bounding Box:** Determine if the current cell `(r, c)` falls within the spatial constraint defined in step 1. This means checking if a bounding box exists AND if `r` is between `min_r` and `max_r` (inclusive) AND `c` is between `min_c` and `max_c` (inclusive). If no bounding box exists, this check automatically passes.
        ii. **Check Local Context (if Bounding Box check passed):** If the bounding box check passed, then check if the cell `(r, c)` is locally situated between two '0's in the *input grid*:
            1.  Check horizontally: Is there a '0' at `(r, c_left)` with `c_left < c` AND a '0' at `(r, c_right)` with `c_right > c`, such that all cells `(r, k)` for `c_left < k < c_right` contain only '6's in the input grid?
            2.  Check vertically: Is there a '0' at `(r_up, c)` with `r_up < r` AND a '0' at `(r_down, c)` with `r_down > r`, such that all cells `(k, c)` for `r_up < k < r_down` contain only '6's in the input grid?
        iii. **Apply Change:** If the Bounding Box check passed AND (the horizontal check OR the vertical check succeeded), change the value of cell `(r, c)` in the *output grid* to '2'.
        iv. **No Change for 6:** Otherwise (if the input was '6' but it failed either the Bounding Box check or both local context checks), the value at `(r, c)` in the output grid remains '6' (as initially copied).
    e.  **Rule 4 (Default Copy):** Else (if `input_value` is '0' or any other digit not explicitly handled), the value at `(r, c)` in the output grid remains unchanged from the initial copy.
4.  **Finalization:** After processing all cells, return the completed output grid.
