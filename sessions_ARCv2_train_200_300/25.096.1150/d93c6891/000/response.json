The grid sizes vary between examples.\n2.  **Colors/Values:** The significant integer values (colors) appearing are 0, 4, 5, and 7. Colors 0 and 4 often appear as background or large filled areas.\n3.  **Key Transformation Color:** The color 7 seems to be the primary trigger for changes. Blocks of connected 7s are modified.\n4.  **Secondary Transformation Color:** The color 5 is also affected, consistently changing to color 4 in the output.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The way a block of 7s transforms depends on its dimensions (height and width). The transformation involves changing some or all of the 7s within a block to 5s. All original 5s are changed to 4s. Other colors (0 and 4) generally remain unchanged unless they were part of the initial 5s group.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Identify all distinct connected blocks (components) of cells with the color 7 in the input grid. Use 8-way connectivity (including diagonals) is usually assumed for block finding in ARC, but let's stick to cardinal (4-way) unless contradicted. *Self-correction: Looking closely, connectivity seems cardinal*. Assume cardinal connectivity.\n3.  For each identified block of 7s:\n    a.  Determine its bounding box (minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, maximum column).\n    b.  Calculate the block's height (`H = max_row - min_row + 1`) and width (`W = max_col - min_col + 1`).\n    c.  **Apply transformation rules based on dimensions:**\n        i.   If `H == 1`, leave all 7s in this block unchanged in the output grid.\n        ii.  If `H == 2` and `W == 2` or `W == 3`, change all 7s within this block's bounding box to 5 in the output grid.\n        iii. If `H == 2` and `W == 6`, change the 7s in the top row of the block (row = `min_row`) to 5s in the output grid, and leave the 7s in the bottom row (row = `max_row`) unchanged as 7s.\n        iv.  If `H == 3` and `W == 3`, change the 7s in the first two columns of the block (columns = `min_col`, `min_col + 1`) to 5s in the output grid, and leave the 7s in the third column (column = `min_col + 2`) unchanged as 7s.\n        *(Implicit: Assume these cover all cases seen, other H/W combinations might default to no change or require more examples).*\n4.  Iterate through every cell of the *original* input grid. If a cell's color is 5, set the corresponding cell's color in the output grid to 4. (This overwrites any potential changes made in step 3 if a 7 somehow transformed into a 5 that was originally a 5 - unlikely but covers the logic). *Self-correction: It's simpler - perform this step *after* processing the 7s, operating on the original input locations.* Iterate through the input grid: if `input[r][c] == 5`, set `output[r][c] = 4`. This ensures it doesn't interfere with the 7->5 transformation.\n5.  The resulting output grid contains the final transformed state."
