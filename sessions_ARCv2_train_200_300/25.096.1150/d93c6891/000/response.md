Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of integers. The grid sizes vary between examples.
2.  **Colors/Values:** The significant integer values (colors) appearing are 0, 4, 5, and 7. Colors 0 and 4 often appear as background or large filled areas.
3.  **Key Transformation Color:** The color 7 seems to be the primary trigger for changes. Blocks of connected 7s are modified.
4.  **Secondary Transformation Color:** The color 5 is also affected, consistently changing to color 4 in the output.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The way a block of 7s transforms depends on its dimensions (height and width). The transformation involves changing some or all of the 7s within a block to 5s. All original 5s are changed to 4s. Other colors (0 and 4) generally remain unchanged unless they were part of the initial 5s group.

## YAML Facts

# YAML document describing the observations from the examples

# -- Objects --
Objects:
  - Grid: Represents the 2D input and output data structure.
    Properties:
      - dimensions: height and width (variable between examples)
      - cells: individual units within the grid
  - Cell: Represents a single position in the grid.
    Properties:
      - coordinates: row and column index
      - color: integer value (0, 4, 5, or 7 are significant)
  - Connected Component (Block): A group of adjacent cells sharing the same color (specifically color 7 in this task).
    Properties:
      - color: the shared color (always 7 for the relevant blocks)
      - cells: list of coordinates belonging to the block
      - bounding_box: min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col defining the extent
      - height: calculated from bounding_box (max_row - min_row + 1)
      - width: calculated from bounding_box (max_col - min_col + 1)

# -- Actions --
Actions:
  - Identify Blocks: Find all connected components of cells with color 7 in the input grid.
  - Analyze Block Dimensions: For each block of 7s, calculate its height and width.
  - Transform 7s: Modify the color of cells within each 7s block based on its dimensions and potentially the cell's relative position within the block (changing 7s to 5s according to specific rules).
  - Transform 5s: Change the color of all cells that originally had color 5 to color 4.
  - Copy Unchanged: Leave all other cells (original 0s and 4s) with their original colors.

# -- Relationships --
Relationships:
  - Cell Membership: Each cell belongs to the grid. Some cells belong to a specific connected component (block).
  - Transformation Dependency:
    - The transformation rule applied to a block of 7s depends directly on its height and width.
    - The transformation of 5s to 4s is global and unconditional for all cells originally containing 5.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct connected blocks (components) of cells with the color 7 in the input grid. Use 8-way connectivity (including diagonals) is usually assumed for block finding in ARC, but let's stick to cardinal (4-way) unless contradicted. *Self-correction: Looking closely, connectivity seems cardinal*. Assume cardinal connectivity.
3.  For each identified block of 7s:
    a.  Determine its bounding box (minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, maximum column).
    b.  Calculate the block's height (`H = max_row - min_row + 1`) and width (`W = max_col - min_col + 1`).
    c.  **Apply transformation rules based on dimensions:**
        i.   If `H == 1`, leave all 7s in this block unchanged in the output grid.
        ii.  If `H == 2` and `W == 2` or `W == 3`, change all 7s within this block's bounding box to 5 in the output grid.
        iii. If `H == 2` and `W == 6`, change the 7s in the top row of the block (row = `min_row`) to 5s in the output grid, and leave the 7s in the bottom row (row = `max_row`) unchanged as 7s.
        iv.  If `H == 3` and `W == 3`, change the 7s in the first two columns of the block (columns = `min_col`, `min_col + 1`) to 5s in the output grid, and leave the 7s in the third column (column = `min_col + 2`) unchanged as 7s.
        *(Implicit: Assume these cover all cases seen, other H/W combinations might default to no change or require more examples).*
4.  Iterate through every cell of the *original* input grid. If a cell's color is 5, set the corresponding cell's color in the output grid to 4. (This overwrites any potential changes made in step 3 if a 7 somehow transformed into a 5 that was originally a 5 - unlikely but covers the logic). *Self-correction: It's simpler - perform this step *after* processing the 7s, operating on the original input locations.* Iterate through the input grid: if `input[r][c] == 5`, set `output[r][c] = 4`. This ensures it doesn't interfere with the 7->5 transformation.
5.  The resulting output grid contains the final transformed state.
