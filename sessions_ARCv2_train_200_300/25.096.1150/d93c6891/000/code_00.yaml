# YAML document describing the observations from the examples

# -- Objects --
Objects:
  - Grid: Represents the 2D input and output data structure.
    Properties:
      - dimensions: height and width (variable between examples)
      - cells: individual units within the grid
  - Cell: Represents a single position in the grid.
    Properties:
      - coordinates: row and column index
      - color: integer value (0, 4, 5, or 7 are significant)
  - Connected Component (Block): A group of adjacent cells sharing the same color (specifically color 7 in this task).
    Properties:
      - color: the shared color (always 7 for the relevant blocks)
      - cells: list of coordinates belonging to the block
      - bounding_box: min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col defining the extent
      - height: calculated from bounding_box (max_row - min_row + 1)
      - width: calculated from bounding_box (max_col - min_col + 1)

# -- Actions --
Actions:
  - Identify Blocks: Find all connected components of cells with color 7 in the input grid.
  - Analyze Block Dimensions: For each block of 7s, calculate its height and width.
  - Transform 7s: Modify the color of cells within each 7s block based on its dimensions and potentially the cell's relative position within the block (changing 7s to 5s according to specific rules).
  - Transform 5s: Change the color of all cells that originally had color 5 to color 4.
  - Copy Unchanged: Leave all other cells (original 0s and 4s) with their original colors.

# -- Relationships --
Relationships:
  - Cell Membership: Each cell belongs to the grid. Some cells belong to a specific connected component (block).
  - Transformation Dependency:
    - The transformation rule applied to a block of 7s depends directly on its height and width.
    - The transformation of 5s to 4s is global and unconditional for all cells originally containing 5.
