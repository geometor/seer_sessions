Identify connected blocks of color 7 in the input grid. Based on the height (H) and width (W) of each block's bounding box, apply specific transformations changing some or all 7s to 5s:
- If H=1, no change.
- If H=2 and W=2 or W=3, change all 7s in the block to 5s.
- If H=2 and W=6, change 7s in the top row of the block to 5s, leave the bottom row as 7s.
- If H=3 and W=3, change 7s in the first two columns of the block to 5s, leave the third column as 7s.
After processing all 7-blocks, iterate through the grid and change any cell that was originally color 5 to color 4.
