The failure occurred specifically on `train_3`, indicating that the transformation rule implemented (`erase if 0 < neighbor_value < input_value`) is too restrictive or incorrect. The original hypothesis derived from perceptual analysis was `erase if neighbor_value != 0 and neighbor_value != input_value`.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Verify the exact discrepancies in `train_3` using code execution.\n2.  Re-evaluate the transformation rule based on all examples, likely reverting to the \"different non-zero neighbor\" condition.\n3.  Update the Facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the refined understanding.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's confirm the number of pixel differences in `train_3` and check other examples.\n\n"
