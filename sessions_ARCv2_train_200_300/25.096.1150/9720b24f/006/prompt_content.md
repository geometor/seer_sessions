```python
import copy

"""
Creates an output grid based on the input grid. Iterates through each cell 
in the input grid. If a cell has a non-zero value, it checks its orthogonal 
neighbors (up, down, left, right). If any neighbor has a non-zero value that 
is *smaller* than the current cell's value, then the current cell's value is 
set to 0 in the output grid. Otherwise (if all non-zero neighbors have values 
equal to or greater than the current cell, or if all neighbors are zero), 
the current cell's value is kept in the output grid. Cells with value 0 in 
the input grid remain 0 in the output grid.
"""

def transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
    """
    Transforms the input grid based on comparing cell values with their 
    smaller non-zero neighbors.

    Args:
        input_grid: A list of lists representing the 2D grid of integers.
