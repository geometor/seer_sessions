            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code implementation, based on the first hypothesis (erase if *any* different non-zero neighbor exists), failed across all training examples. The errors consistently showed that cells were being erased when they should have been kept. Specifically, when two cells of different non-zero colors (say, A and B) were adjacent, the initial code erased *both* A and B. However, the expected outputs show that only *one* of the adjacent cells is erased.\n\nAnalysis of the input/output pairs reveals a clear pattern: the cell with the *higher* value is erased when adjacent to a cell with a *lower* non-zero value. Cells adjacent only to zero or cells of the same value are kept. Cells adjacent to higher non-zero values are also kept. This leads to a revised understanding of the transformation rule.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the natural language program and the associated facts to reflect this \"erase if greater than neighbor\" rule. The previous code's structure (iterating through cells, checking neighbors) is sound, but the condition for erasure needs modification.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe following metrics confirm that the revised hypothesis (\"erase if value > neighbor_value > 0\") aligns with the observed transformations in the training data.\n\n"
