If a cell has a non-zero value, it checks its orthogonal \nneighbors (up, down, left, right). If any neighbor has a non-zero value that \nis *smaller* than the current cell's value, then the current cell's value is \nset to 0 in the output grid. Otherwise (if all non-zero neighbors have values \nequal to or greater than the current cell, or if all neighbors are zero), \nthe current cell's value is kept in the output grid. Cells with value 0 in \nthe input grid remain 0 in the output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on comparing cell values with their \n    smaller non-zero neighbors.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the 2D grid of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        A new list of lists representing the transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get grid dimensions\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    if rows == 0:\n        return []\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n    if cols == 0:\n        # Handle empty rows case\n        return [[] for _ in range(rows)]\n\n    # Initialize output_grid as a deep copy of the input grid.\n    # We will modify this grid by setting cells to 0 where needed based on the rule.\n    output_grid = copy.deepcopy(input_grid)\n\n    # Define orthogonal neighbor offsets\n    neighbor_offsets = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] # Up, Down, Left, Right\n\n    # Iterate through each cell of the input_grid\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Get the value of the current cell from the original input grid\n            input_value = input_grid[r][c]\n\n            # Skip processing if the cell value is 0 (it remains 0 in the output)\n            if input_value == 0:\n                continue\n\n            # Flag to determine if the current cell should be erased\n            should_erase = False\n\n            # Check orthogonal neighbors\n            for dr, dc in neighbor_offsets:\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n\n                # Check if the neighbor coordinate is within the bounds of the input_grid\n                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                    # Get the neighbor's value from the *original* input_grid\n                    neighbor_value = input_grid[nr][nc]\n\n                    # Check the core condition: erase if a neighbor has a smaller non-zero value\n                    if 0 < neighbor_value < input_value:\n                        # If such a neighbor exists, mark this cell for erasing\n                        should_erase = True\n                        # Break the inner loop (no need to check other neighbors)\n                        break \n            \n            # If the cell was marked for erasing, set its value to 0 in the output_grid\n            if should_erase:\n                output_grid[r][c] = 0\n            # Otherwise, the value remains as it was copied initially from input_grid.\n\n    # Return the modified output_grid\n    return output_grid\n```"
