## Perception

The task involves processing a 2D grid of integers. The transformation rule appears to selectively change some non-zero integer values back to 0 based on their neighboring cells. Cells with the value 0 seem to remain unchanged. The non-zero values likely represent different types of objects or "colors". The core pattern is that a non-zero cell is "erased" (set to 0) if it is orthogonally adjacent to another cell containing a *different* non-zero value. Cells that are only adjacent to cells with the same non-zero value or zero value remain unchanged.

## Facts

task_type: grid_transformation
grid_elements:
  - type: integer
    value_range: 0-9 (based on examples)
    role: background (0), object_color (non-zero)
objects:
  - id: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer
      - row_index: integer
      - column_index: integer
      - neighbors: list of adjacent cells (orthogonal)
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: [cell, cell]
    definition: Two cells are adjacent if they share an edge (orthogonally: up, down, left, right).
actions:
  - name: evaluate_cell

        input: cell, input_grid
        output: keep_flag (boolean)
        logic: |
          Iterate through orthogonal neighbors.
          If any neighbor exists and has a value `v` such that `v != 0` and `v != cell.value`,
          set `keep_flag = False` and stop checking neighbors.
          Otherwise, `keep_flag = True`.
      - name: update_output_cell
        input: cell, keep_flag
        target: corresponding cell in output grid
        logic: |
          If `keep_flag` is False, set output cell value to 0.
          Otherwise, set output cell value to input cell value.
  - name: copy_zero_cell
    input: cell (from input grid)
    condition: cell.value == 0
    target: corresponding cell in output grid
    logic: Set output cell value to 0.
transformation_goal: Create an output grid where non-zero cells from the input are set to 0 if they have any orthogonal neighbor with a different non-zero value.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid (`output_grid`) with the same dimensions as the `input_grid`.
2.  Iterate through each cell of the `input_grid` using its row index `r` and column index `c`.
3.  Get the value of the current cell in the `input_grid`: `input_value = input_grid[r][c]`.
4.  If `input_value` is 0, set the corresponding cell in the `output_grid` to 0 (`output_grid[r][c] = 0`) and continue to the next cell.
5.  If `input_value` is not 0, assume initially that the value should be kept: set a flag `should_erase = False`.
6.  Define the coordinates of the orthogonal neighbors: `(r-1, c)`, `(r+1, c)`, `(r, c-1)`, `(r, c+1)`.
7.  For each neighbor coordinate `(nr, nc)`:
    a.  Check if the neighbor coordinate is within the bounds of the `input_grid`.
    b.  If it is within bounds, get the neighbor's value: `neighbor_value = input_grid[nr][nc]`.
    c.  Check if the `neighbor_value` is different from 0 AND different from the `input_value`.
    d.  If both conditions in step 7c are true, set `should_erase = True` and break out of the neighbor-checking loop (no need to check other neighbors for this cell).
8.  After checking all neighbors (or breaking early), if `should_erase` is `True`, set the corresponding cell in the `output_grid` to 0 (`output_grid[r][c] = 0`).
9.  If `should_erase` is `False`, copy the `input_value` to the corresponding cell in the `output_grid` (`output_grid[r][c] = input_value`).
10. After iterating through all cells, return the `output_grid`.

## General Assessment

The initial hypothesis, that a non-zero cell is erased if *any* orthogonally adjacent neighbor has a *different* non-zero value, was partially correct but led to incorrect transformations in all examples. The provided code implemented this initial hypothesis.

Comparing the `transformed_output` with the `expected_output` reveals a clear pattern: cells are only erased if they are adjacent to a *smaller* non-zero value. Cells adjacent only to zero, the same value, or *larger* non-zero values are kept.

**Strategy:**
1.  Refine the understanding of the trigger condition for erasing a cell.
2.  Gather detailed metrics on the differences between expected and transformed outputs to confirm the new hypothesis.
3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to incorporate the refined rule: A non-zero cell `X` at `(r, c)` is set to 0 if and only if there exists an orthogonal neighbor `Y` at `(nr, nc)` such that `Y != 0` and `Y < X`.
4.  Prepare this refined information for the coder phase.

## Metrics Analysis

Let's analyze the discrepancies programmatically.
