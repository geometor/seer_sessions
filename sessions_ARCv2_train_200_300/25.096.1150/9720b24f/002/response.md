## General Assessment

The initial hypothesis, that a non-zero cell is erased if *any* orthogonally adjacent neighbor has a *different* non-zero value, was partially correct but led to incorrect transformations in all examples. The provided code implemented this initial hypothesis.

Comparing the `transformed_output` with the `expected_output` reveals a clear pattern: cells are only erased if they are adjacent to a *smaller* non-zero value. Cells adjacent only to zero, the same value, or *larger* non-zero values are kept.

**Strategy:**
1.  Refine the understanding of the trigger condition for erasing a cell.
2.  Gather detailed metrics on the differences between expected and transformed outputs to confirm the new hypothesis.
3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to incorporate the refined rule: A non-zero cell `X` at `(r, c)` is set to 0 if and only if there exists an orthogonal neighbor `Y` at `(nr, nc)` such that `Y != 0` and `Y < X`.
4.  Prepare this refined information for the coder phase.

## Metrics Analysis

Let's analyze the discrepancies programmatically.
