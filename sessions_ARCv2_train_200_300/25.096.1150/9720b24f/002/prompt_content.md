import copy

"""
Creates an output grid where non-zero cells from the input are set to 0 
if they have any orthogonal neighbor (up, down, left, right) with a 
different non-zero value. Cells with value 0 remain 0. Non-zero cells 
that are only adjacent to cells with the same non-zero value or 0 remain 
unchanged.
