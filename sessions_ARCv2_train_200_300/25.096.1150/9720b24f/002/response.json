The provided code implemented this initial hypothesis.\n\nComparing the `transformed_output` with the `expected_output` reveals a clear pattern: cells are only erased if they are adjacent to a *smaller* non-zero value. Cells adjacent only to zero, the same value, or *larger* non-zero values are kept.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Refine the understanding of the trigger condition for erasing a cell.\n2.  Gather detailed metrics on the differences between expected and transformed outputs to confirm the new hypothesis.\n3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to incorporate the refined rule: A non-zero cell `X` at `(r, c)` is set to 0 if and only if there exists an orthogonal neighbor `Y` at `(nr, nc)` such that `Y != 0` and `Y < X`.\n4.  Prepare this refined information for the coder phase.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the discrepancies programmatically.\n\n"
