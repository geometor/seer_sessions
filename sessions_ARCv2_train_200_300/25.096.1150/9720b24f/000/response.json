The transformation rule appears to selectively change some non-zero integer values back to 0 based on their neighboring cells. Cells with the value 0 seem to remain unchanged. The non-zero values likely represent different types of objects or \"colors\". The core pattern is that a non-zero cell is \"erased\" (set to 0) if it is orthogonally adjacent to another cell containing a *different* non-zero value. Cells that are only adjacent to cells with the same non-zero value or zero value remain unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
