Convert the input list of lists into a NumPy array.\n2. Find all connected components (objects) of non-zero cells in the input grid.\n3. Identify the largest object composed of the digit '1'. If no '1' object exists, \n   proceed assuming no boundary filtering is needed.\n4. Filter out the '1' object(s) and any objects completely enclosed within the \n   bounding box of the largest '1' object.\n5. Identify the four remaining target objects. It's assumed there will be exactly four.\n6. For each target object:\n    a. Calculate its geometric center.\n    b. Extract its shape into a 3x3 grid, maintaining its top-left alignment \n       relative to its bounding box.\n7. Calculate the overall geometric center of the centers of the four target objects.\n8. Determine the relative quadrant (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) \n   for each target object based on its center's position relative to the overall center.\n9. Initialize a 7x7 output grid filled with zeros.\n10. Place the 3x3 shape grid of each target object into the corresponding quadrant \n    of the output grid:\n    - Top-Left object -> Output[0:3, 0:3]\n    - Top-Right object -> Output[0:3, 4:7]\n    - Bottom-Left object -> Output[4:7, 0:3]\n    - Bottom-Right object -> Output[4:7, 4:7]\n11.
