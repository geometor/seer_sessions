**General Assessment:**

The previous analysis correctly identified the task as maze generation within a grid. The generated code successfully implements the general structure: an N x N grid, boundary walls ('3'), an entrance ('0') at (1, 0), an exit ('0') at (N-2, 0), and an inner maze structure using Randomized DFS.

However, the evaluation results show that the generated mazes do not match the expected outputs. This is because the Randomized DFS algorithm, by design, produces different maze layouts each time it runs (or based on the random seed). The training examples, however, show a *specific, deterministic* maze pattern for each grid size N.

The core issue is the use of randomness (`random.choice`) in the implemented DFS algorithm. The transformation rule required by the task must be deterministic.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Analyze Determinism:** Re-examine the example outputs to identify the deterministic pattern or rule used to generate the specific maze structures. The rule likely depends solely on the grid size N.
2.  **Verify Boundaries:** Double-check if the boundary conditions (outer walls, entrance/exit placement) are consistently met in the expected outputs and if the previous code implemented them correctly.
3.  **Refine Algorithm Description:** Update the natural language program and YAML facts to reflect that the maze generation is deterministic, resulting in the exact patterns shown. Avoid specifying Randomized DFS unless a fixed seed strategy could replicate the examples (which seems unlikely without knowing the original seed or if the algorithm is different).
4.  **Focus on Replication:** The goal shifts from generating *a* maze to generating *the specific* maze shown for each N. This might involve reverse-engineering the pattern or identifying a known deterministic maze algorithm that produces these results.

**Metrics:**

Let's gather metrics on the expected outputs to better understand the deterministic target pattern.
