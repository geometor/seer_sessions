**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the task as maze generation within a grid, defining paths with '0' and walls with '3'. The boundaries, entrance, and exit were also correctly identified. The Python code implemented a standard Randomized Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm for maze carving.

However, the results clearly show that the generated maze patterns do not match the expected outputs, despite having the correct overall structure (boundaries, entrance/exit, dimensions, character set). The key discrepancy lies in the specific layout of the internal maze paths and walls.

This indicates that the maze generation process is **deterministic** for a given grid size `N`, rather than random as implemented. The specific path chosen in the training examples is consistent and repeatable for each size `N`. The Randomized DFS algorithm, while a valid maze generation technique, produces different results on each run (or with different seeds).

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Identify the Deterministic Algorithm:** The primary task is to deduce the specific, deterministic algorithm or rule used to generate the exact maze patterns shown in the examples. This could be:
    *   A standard maze algorithm (like DFS or Prim's) executed with a **fixed random seed** (potentially `seed=0`, `seed=N`, or some other constant).
    *   A non-standard or custom algorithm specifically designed to produce these patterns.
    *   A pattern based directly on grid coordinates or size `N`.
2.  **Refine Observations:** Re-examine the structure of the expected maze paths. Look for repeating motifs, symmetry, or algorithmic patterns (e.g., always turning right when possible, biases in direction).
3.  **Update Documentation:** Modify the YAML facts and the Natural Language Program to reflect the deterministic nature of the maze generation, removing references to randomness unless it's confirmed to be seeded deterministically. Describe the observed structural properties accurately.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's gather metrics on the input/output grids to better understand the constraints and properties.

**Observations from Metrics:**

*   Input and output grids are always square (N x N).
*   Output grids contain only 0s (paths) and 3s (walls).
*   The number of path cells (0s) and wall cells (3s) varies with N, but follows a consistent pattern expected from a perfect maze (a maze with no loops and where all cells are reachable). In a perfect maze generated by carving paths in a grid where potential path cells and wall cells alternate (like in DFS or Prim's on a grid), roughly half the cells end up as paths and half as walls within the carved area. The exact count depends on the boundary conditions and the specific algorithm.

**Updated Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Get Dimensions:** Determine the size `N` from the input N x N grid.
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create an output grid of size N x N and initialize all its cells with the value '3' (representing walls).
3.  **Apply Deterministic Maze Generation (Inner Grid):**
    a.  Define the inner grid region as rows 1 to N-2 and columns 1 to N-2. Handle edge cases where N < 5 (the inner grid is too small for standard carving; only perform initialization and opening creation).
    b.  **(Hypothesis)** Initialize a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) with a fixed seed (e.g., `seed = 0`).
    c.  Select a starting cell within the inner region, typically (1, 1). Mark this cell as a path by setting its value to '0'.
    d.  Execute a maze generation algorithm (like Depth-First Search) within the inner grid, using the seeded PRNG for any random choices (like selecting the next neighbor to visit or the direction to carve).
        i.  *DFS Example:* Maintain a stack, starting with (1, 1). While the stack is not empty, look at the top cell. Find neighbors (2 steps away, within the inner grid, still walls '3'). If neighbors exist, use the seeded PRNG to choose one, carve the path (set the wall between and the neighbor cell to '0'), and push the neighbor onto the stack. If no neighbors, pop from the stack (backtrack).
    e.  This process ensures that the exact same sequence of path carving and wall placement occurs every time for a given size `N`, replicating the specific patterns seen in the examples.
4.  **Create Entrance and Exit:**
    a.  Set the value of the cell at coordinates (1, 0) in the output grid to '0'.
    b.  Set the value of the cell at coordinates (N-2, 0) in the output grid to '0' (ensure N>=3 for a distinct exit).
5.  **Final Output:** The resulting output grid contains the specific, deterministic maze pattern required for size N.
