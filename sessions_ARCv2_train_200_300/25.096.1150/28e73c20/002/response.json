            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code successfully implements the general structure observed: creating a grid, setting boundary walls (3s), creating entrance/exit points (0s) on the left boundary, and using a maze generation algorithm (Randomized DFS) to carve paths (0s) within the inner grid.\n\nHowever, the comparison shows that the *specific* internal maze pattern generated by the code's `random.choice` does not match the *specific* pattern in the training examples for any given size. The boundaries and entrance/exit points are correctly placed, but the internal walls and paths differ.\n\nThis indicates that the maze generation process, while likely based on an algorithm like DFS, is not purely random in the context of producing the *exact* target output. It's either:\n1.  A deterministic variant of the algorithm (e.g., neighbors are always explored in a fixed order).\n2.  Using a pseudo-random number generator initialized with a specific seed (potentially derived from the grid size N, although how is unclear).\n3.  Following a completely different, potentially constructive, pattern rule.\n\nGiven the examples, the Randomized DFS approach remains a strong candidate for the *type* of algorithm. The discrepancy lies in achieving the specific deterministic output shown in the examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Maintain the Randomized DFS algorithm as the core logic for the inner maze generation in the natural language program, as it correctly models the *type* of structure (a perfect maze connecting entrance and exit within boundaries).\n2.  Acknowledge that the exact path/wall configuration within the maze appears deterministic for a given size N in the examples, but the specific rule (fixed seed or deterministic neighbor choice) cannot be definitively inferred without more information or examples.\n3.  Refine the natural language program and YAML facts to accurately describe the confirmed deterministic elements (boundaries, entrance/exit) and the nature of the inner maze generation (likely DFS-based, creates a connected path, but the specific example patterns imply determinism).\n\n**Metrics**\n\nBased on analysis of the examples and the code's attempt:\n\n*   **Input:** Always an N x N grid of 0s. Dimensions vary (6x6, 8x8, 10x10, 13x13, 15x15).\n*   **Output:** Always an N x N grid of 0s and 3s.\n*   **Boundary Conditions (Deterministic & Matched by Code Logic):**\n    *   Top Row (Row 0): All 3s.\n    *   Bottom Row (Row N-1): All 3s.\n    *   Right Column (Col N-1): All 3s.\n    *   Left Column (Col 0): Cells (1, 0) and (N-2, 0) are 0 (entrance/exit). All other cells in Col 0 are 3. (This holds for N>=3).\n*   **Inner Grid (Rows 1 to N-2, Cols 1 to N-2):**\n    *   Contains a mixture of 0s (paths) and 3s (walls).\n    *   The 0s form a single connected component linking the entrance corridor starting near (1,1) to the exit corridor near (N-2, 1).\n    *   The specific pattern of 0s and 3s generated by the *randomized* code does not match the *specific* deterministic patterns shown in the examples. The examples show a unique, fixed maze layout for each N.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```"
