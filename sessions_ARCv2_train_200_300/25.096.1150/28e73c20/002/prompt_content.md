```python
import random

"""
Transforms an N x N grid of zeros into a maze represented by 0s (paths) and 3s (walls).

The transformation follows these steps:
1.  Initialize an N x N output grid filled entirely with 3s (walls).
2.  Use a Randomized Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to carve paths (0s) within the inner part of the grid (rows 1 to N-2, columns 1 to N-2).
    a. Start at cell (1, 1).
    b. Maintain a stack for the DFS traversal.
    c. While the stack is not empty:
        i.   Get the current cell (r, c).
        ii.  Find unvisited neighbors (cells 2 steps away horizontally or vertically, still marked as 3) within the inner grid bounds [1..N-2, 1..N-2].
        iii. If unvisited neighbors exist:
             - Randomly choose one neighbor (nr, nc).
             - Push the current cell back onto the stack.
             - Calculate the wall cell ((r+nr)//2, (c+nc)//2) between the current cell and the neighbor.
             - Mark the wall cell and the neighbor cell as paths (0) in the output grid.
             - Push the neighbor cell onto the stack.
        iv.  If no unvisited neighbors exist, pop the current cell (backtrack).
3.  Create an entrance at (1, 0) and an exit at (N-2, 0) by setting these cells to 0.
4.  The final grid contains the maze structure. The outer border (top, bottom, right) remains mostly walls (3), the left border has the entrance/exit, and the interior contains the carved maze.
