"""
Transforms an N x N grid of zeros into a maze represented by 0s (paths) 
and 3s (walls).

The transformation follows these steps:
1.  Initialize an N x N output grid filled entirely with 3s (walls).
2.  Use a maze generation algorithm, likely Randomized Depth-First Search (DFS),
    to carve paths (0s) within the inner part of the grid 
    (rows 1 to N-2, columns 1 to N-2). 
    NOTE: The specific examples provided seem to follow a deterministic pattern
    for maze generation which is not fully captured by standard Randomized DFS.
    This implementation uses standard Randomized DFS, so the generated maze
    layout will likely differ from the examples while maintaining the overall
    structure (boundaries, entrance, exit, connectivity).
    a. Start carving from cell (1, 1).
    b. Maintain a stack for the DFS traversal.
    c. While the stack is not empty:
        i.   Get the current cell (r, c).
        ii.  Find unvisited neighbors (cells 2 steps away horizontally or 
             vertically, still marked as 3) within the inner grid bounds 
             [1..N-2, 1..N-2].
        iii. If unvisited neighbors exist:
             - Randomly choose one neighbor (nr, nc).
             - Calculate the wall cell ((r+nr)//2, (c+nc)//2) between the 
               current cell and the neighbor.
             - Mark the wall cell and the neighbor cell as paths (0).
             - Push the neighbor cell onto the stack.
        iv.  If no unvisited neighbors exist, pop the current cell (backtrack).
3.  Create an entrance at (1, 0) and an exit at (N-2, 0) by setting 
    these cells to 0.
4.  The final grid contains the maze structure with outer walls, 
    an entrance/exit on the left, and an inner carved maze.
