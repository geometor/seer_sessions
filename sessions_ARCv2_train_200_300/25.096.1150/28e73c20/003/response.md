"""
Transforms an N x N grid of zeros into a specific, deterministic maze pattern 
for that size N, represented by '0' for paths and '3' for walls.

The transformation follows these general steps, although the specific internal 
maze pattern generated by this code will differ from the examples due to the 
use of randomness (the examples imply a deterministic rule or fixed seed):

1.  **Initialization:** Create an N x N output grid filled entirely with the 
    wall character '3'.
2.  **Maze Carving (Inner Grid):** Apply a maze generation algorithm 
    (Randomized Depth-First Search - DFS) to the inner grid area 
    (rows 1 to N-2, columns 1 to N-2).
    a. Start carving paths (changing '3' to '0') from cell (1, 1).
    b. Use a stack to manage the DFS traversal.
    c. Iteratively move to unvisited neighboring cells (2 steps away), carving 
       the wall between the current cell and the neighbor.
    d. Backtrack when a dead end is reached.
3.  **Create Entrance and Exit:** Set the cells at coordinates (1, 0) and 
    (N-2, 0) in the output grid to the path character '0'.
4.  **Final Output:** Return the grid containing the maze pattern.
