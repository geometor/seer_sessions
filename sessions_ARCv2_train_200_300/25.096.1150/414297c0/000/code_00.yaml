task_description: Extract the largest connected non-zero region from the input grid and represent it within its bounding box, filling non-region cells with the region's dominant color.

definitions:
  grid: A 2D array of integers representing pixels or cells.
  color: An integer value in a grid cell. 0 represents the background.
  region: A set of connected cells in the grid that have non-zero colors. Connectivity is typically 4-directional (up, down, left, right). Note: A single region might contain multiple different non-zero colors if they are connected.
  connected_component: A specific type of region where all cells are reachable from each other by traversing adjacent cells of non-zero color, considering all non-zero colors as potentially part of the same component.
  region_size: The number of cells belonging to a region.
  largest_region: The connected component (region) with the maximum number of cells among all non-zero connected components in the input grid.
  dominant_color: The color that appears most frequently within the largest_region.
  bounding_box: The smallest rectangular subgrid that completely encloses all cells of a given region. Defined by min/max row and column indices.
