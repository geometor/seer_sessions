task_description: >
  Identify the largest monochromatic connected component (LMC) in the input grid. 
  Extract the subgrid corresponding to the LMC's bounding box. Within this subgrid, 
  preserve all original non-zero colors from the input grid, and replace all 
  original background (0) cells with the color of the LMC.

definitions:
  grid: A 2D array of integers.
  color: An integer value in a grid cell. 0 represents the background.
  connected_component: A set of connected cells sharing the same non-zero color. Connectivity is 4-directional.
  component_size: The number of cells in a connected component.
  largest_monochromatic_component (LMC): The single-color connected component with the maximum number of cells.
  LMC_color: The color of the LMC.
  bounding_box: The smallest rectangle (min/max row and column indices) enclosing a component.

input_elements:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    description: Contains background (0) and multiple monochromatic regions.

output_elements:
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    description: >
      Represents the extracted subgrid based on the LMC's bounding box, 
      with background cells filled by the LMC_color.

      with the lmc_color.
