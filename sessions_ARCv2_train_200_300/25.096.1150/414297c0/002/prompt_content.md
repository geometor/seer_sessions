"""
Transforms the input grid by performing the following steps:
1. Identifies all connected components of non-zero cells. Connectivity is 4-directional (up, down, left, right).
   All adjacent non-zero cells are considered connected, regardless of their specific color value.
2. Selects the component with the largest number of cells. If there's a tie, any of the largest is chosen.
3. Determines the dominant (most frequent) non-zero color within the largest component.
4. Calculates the minimum bounding box (smallest rectangle) enclosing the largest component.
5. Creates an output grid with dimensions matching the bounding box.
6. Fills the output grid:
   - Cells that correspond to a cell location within the bounding box *and* belong to the largest component
     are assigned their original color from the input grid.
   - All other cells within the output grid (those corresponding to background '0' cells or cells belonging
     to other components within the input grid's bounding box) are filled with the dominant color found in step 3.
