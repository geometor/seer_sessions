            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid:** The data is presented as a 2D grid of numbers (likely representing colors). The grid size appears consistent (15x15).\n2.  **Values/Colors:** Three distinct values are present:\n    *   `0`: Appears to be the background color (Black).\n    *   `2`: Forms distinct shapes, often rectangular or U-shaped (Blue). These shapes seem static between input and output.\n    *   `5`: Appears in smaller groups or individual pixels (Red). These are the elements that change position.\n3.  **Shapes:**\n    *   The `2` values form stable structures that seem to define boundaries or containers.\n    *   The `5` values form shapes or patterns that are relocated.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the `5` values. `5` values located \"outside\" the region defined by the `2` shapes are moved to an \"inside\" empty region delineated by the `2` shapes. The `2` shapes and the background `0`s (except where `5`s are moved) remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

These are the 'boundary shapes'.\n3.  Determine the overall bounding box containing all 'boundary shapes'.\n4.  Identify all connected components formed by cells with value `5`. These are the 'object patterns'.\n5.  Identify which 'object patterns' lie completely 'outside' the bounding box determined in step 3. Collect the shape/pattern of each 'outside object pattern' and its general location relative to the bounding box (e.g., left, right, top, bottom).\n6.  For each 'outside object pattern' identified in step 5, set the corresponding cells in the *output grid* to `0`.\n7.  Identify all cells with value `0` in the *input grid* that are located *inside* the bounding box (from step 3) and situated *between* the distinct 'boundary shapes' (if multiple exist). These form the 'target empty regions'. Group these regions based on their location relative to the boundary shapes (e.g., central gap, left gap, etc.).\n8.  For each 'outside object pattern' removed in step 6, place its collected shape/pattern into a corresponding 'target empty region' within the output grid, overwriting the `0`s with `5`s. The placement should match the relative location (e.g., patterns removed from the left outside are placed in the empty region on the left side inside the boundary)."
