task_description: Relocate 'object' patterns (color 5) from outside a 'boundary' shape (color 2) to the empty space inside the boundary.

elements:
  - element: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D Array
      - size: 15x15 (observed)
      - value_type: Integer (0, 2, 5)

  - element: Background
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: Empty space / Background

  - element: BoundaryShape
    properties:
      - value: 2
      - role: Defines container boundaries, static position
      - appearance: Forms connected components (rectangles, U-shapes observed)

  - element: ObjectPattern
    properties:
      - value: 5
      - role: Objects to be potentially moved
      - appearance: Forms connected components (pixels, small groups observed)

relationships:
  - type: Spatial
    from: ObjectPattern
    to: BoundaryShape
    relation:
      - Inside: ObjectPattern is located within the area defined/enclosed by the BoundaryShape.
      - Outside: ObjectPattern is located outside the area defined/enclosed by the BoundaryShape.
  - type: Spatial
    from: Background (value 0)
    to: BoundaryShape
    relation:
      - InsideEmpty: Background cell is located within the area defined/enclosed by the BoundaryShape.

actions:
  - action: Identify
    target: BoundaryShape components
  - action: Identify
    target: ObjectPattern components
  - action: Determine
    target: Spatial relationship (Inside/Outside) for each ObjectPattern relative to BoundaryShape area.
  - action: Identify
    target: InsideEmpty background cells.
  - action: Remove
    target: ObjectPatterns classified as 'Outside'. (Set corresponding grid cells to 0)
  - action: Relocate
    source: Removed 'Outside' ObjectPatterns
    destination: InsideEmpty background cells
    details: The pattern/shape of the removed objects is preserved and placed into the available empty space inside the boundary. The relative positioning seems maintained (e.g., objects outside on the left are moved to the empty space on the left side within the boundary).

input_output_mapping:
  - input_property: Grid configuration including BoundaryShapes and ObjectPatterns (some Outside, some potentially Inside).
  - output_property: Grid configuration where BoundaryShapes are unchanged, Outside ObjectPatterns are removed, and the patterns of these removed objects are replicated in the InsideEmpty regions.
