task_description: Identify and remove solid rectangular shapes of a single color from the input grid, leaving other shapes and the background intact.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      - dimensions: [height, width]
      - cells: collection of cell elements

  - element: cell
    description: A single unit within the grid.
    properties:
      - position: [row, column]
      - color: integer value

  - element: shape
    description: A collection of connected or disconnected cells sharing the same non-zero color.
    properties:
      - color: integer value (non-zero)
      - cell_locations: list of [row, column] coordinates
      - bounding_box: [min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col]
      - is_solid_rectangle: boolean # True if all cells within the bounding box have the shape's color

relationships:
  - A grid contains multiple cells.
  - Cells with the same non-zero color constitute a shape (or potentially multiple shapes of the same color, though not seen in examples).

actions:
  - identify_shapes: Group cells by their non-zero color.
  - calculate_bounding_box: For each identified shape, determine its minimum and maximum row and column indices.
  - check_solid_rectangle: For each shape, verify if the number of cells in the shape equals the area of its bounding box.
  - filter_grid: Create the output grid by copying the input, then changing the color of cells belonging to shapes identified as 'solid rectangles' to the background color (0).

input_features:
  - Input grid contains a background color (0).
  - Input grid contains exactly two non-zero colors.
  - One non-zero color forms a shape that is a solid rectangle.
  - The other non-zero color forms a shape that is not a solid rectangle.

output_features:
  - Output grid retains the background color (0) from the input.
  - Output grid retains the non-rectangular shape from the input.
  - Output grid replaces the solid rectangular shape from the input with the background color (0).
