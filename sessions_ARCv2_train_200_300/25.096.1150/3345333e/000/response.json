The grid size appears consistent within each example (16x16 for both `train_1` and `train_2`).\n2.  **Colors/Numbers:** The grids contain numerical values representing colors. The number 0 consistently represents the background color. Each input grid features two distinct non-zero colors.\n    *   `train_1`: Colors 2 and 3.\n    *   `train_2`: Colors 1 and 6.\n3.  **Shapes/Objects:** The non-zero colors form distinct shapes or regions within the grid.\n    *   In `train_1`, color 3 forms a solid rectangle, while color 2 forms a more complex, somewhat hollow shape.\n    *   In `train_2`, color 1 forms a solid rectangle, while color 6 forms a more complex shape.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves selectively removing one of the non-zero colored shapes from the input grid while preserving the other non-zero shape and the background.\n5.  **Pattern:** In both examples, the shape that is *removed* is the one that forms a solid rectangle. The shape that is *kept* is the one that does not form a solid rectangle (it might be hollow, irregular, or L-shaped, etc.).\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
