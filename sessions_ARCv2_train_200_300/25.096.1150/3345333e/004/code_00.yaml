task_description: Identify and remove solid rectangular shapes of a single color from the input grid, leaving other shapes and the background intact.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing pixels or cells.
    properties:
      - dimensions: [height, width] (Consistent within and between examples)
      - background_color: integer (Consistently 0)
      - cell_values: integers representing different colors/states.

  - element: shape
    description: A collection of connected or disconnected cells sharing the same non-zero color.
    properties:
      - color: integer (value > 0)
      - cell_coordinates: list of [row, column] tuples.
      - cell_count: integer (number of cells with this color).
      - bounding_box: tuple (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) encompassing all cells of the shape.
      - bounding_box_area: integer ((max_row - min_row + 1) * (max_col - min_col + 1)).
      - is_solid_rectangle: boolean (True if cell_count == bounding_box_area).

relationships:
  - Input grid contains exactly one shape where `is_solid_rectangle` is True.
  - Input grid contains exactly one shape where `is_solid_rectangle` is False.
  - The output grid is derived from the input grid.

actions:
  - identify_shapes: For each non-zero color in the input grid, find all its cell coordinates.
  - calculate_shape_properties: For each identified shape, calculate its bounding_box, cell_count, bounding_box_area, and determine if it `is_solid_rectangle`.
  - filter_solid_rectangles:
    - Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
    - Find the shape(s) for which `is_solid_rectangle` is True.
    - For each such shape, iterate through its `cell_coordinates`.
    - Set the value of the corresponding cell in the output grid to the `background_color` (0).

input_features:
  - Input grid with background color 0.
  - Two distinct non-zero colors present.
  - One non-zero color forms a solid rectangle.
  - One non-zero color forms a shape that is *not* a solid rectangle.

output_features:
  - Output grid has the same dimensions as the input.
  - Output grid contains the background color (0).
  - Output grid contains the *exact* shape (pixels and color) of the non-rectangular shape from the input.
  - The area previously occupied by the solid rectangular shape in the input grid is replaced with the background color (0) in the output grid.
