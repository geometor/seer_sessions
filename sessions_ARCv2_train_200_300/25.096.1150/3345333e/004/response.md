**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial code (`code_00.py`) incorrectly interpreted the transformation. Instead of *removing* the solid rectangular shape, it identified the *non-rectangular* shape and filled its *bounding box* in the output grid. The comparison between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` clearly shows this discrepancy: the non-rectangular shape's area is filled solid in the transformed output, whereas the expected output preserves the original pixels of the non-rectangular shape and removes the pixels of the solid rectangular shape.

The strategy is to revert to the initial hypothesis derived from the first example:
1.  Identify all distinct non-zero colored shapes in the input.
2.  For each shape, determine if it forms a solid rectangle (i.e., its constituent cells perfectly fill its bounding box).
3.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
4.  Modify the output grid by changing the color of all cells belonging to the identified solid rectangular shape(s) to the background color (0).

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's analyze the shapes in each training example.


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_grid(grid_list: list[list[int]], example_name: str):
    grid = np.array(grid_list)
    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)
    non_zero_colors = unique_colors[unique_colors != 0]
    print(f"--- Analysis for {example_name} ---")
    print(f"Grid Dimensions: {grid.shape}")
    print(f"Non-zero colors: {non_zero_colors.tolist()}")

    results = {}
    for color in non_zero_colors:
        coords = list(zip(*np.where(grid == color)))
        if not coords:
            print(f"  Color {color}: No cells found.")
            continue

        min_r = min(r for r, c in coords)
        min_c = min(c for r, c in coords)
        max_r = max(r for r, c in coords)
        max_c = max(c for r, c in coords)
        bbox = (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c)
        bbox_h = max_r - min_r + 1
        bbox_w = max_c - min_c + 1
        bbox_area = bbox_h * bbox_w
        cell_count = len(coords)
        is_solid = cell_count == bbox_area

        results[color] = {
            "cell_count": cell_count,

        }

        output_matches_input = True
        for r, c in color_coords:
            if expected_output_grid[r, c] != color_val:
                output_matches_input = False
                break
        if not output_matches_input:
             # Check if these cells are now background
             all_background = all(expected_output_grid[r, c] == 0 for r,c in color_coords)
             if all_background:
                 removed_colors.append(color_val)

    print(f"  Colors removed in output: {removed_colors}")

**Correction**: My code execution for determining removed colors was flawed. It incorrectly checked if the *entire* shape was preserved rather than if it was replaced by background. Let's re-evaluate manually based on the code output and visual inspection:

*   **Train 1:** Color 2 (non-solid) is present in both input and output. Color 3 (solid rectangle) is present in input but *absent* (replaced by 0) in output. **Removed Color: 3**.
*   **Train 2:** Color 6 (non-solid) is present in both input and output. Color 1 (solid rectangle) is present in input but *absent* (replaced by 0) in output. **Removed Color: 1**.

The analysis confirms that the solid rectangular shape is the one being removed in both examples.

**YAML Fact Sheet:**


```yaml
task_description: Identify and remove solid rectangular shapes of a single color from the input grid, leaving other shapes and the background intact.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing pixels or cells.
    properties:
      - dimensions: [height, width] (Consistent within and between examples)
      - background_color: integer (Consistently 0)
      - cell_values: integers representing different colors/states.

  - element: shape
    description: A collection of connected or disconnected cells sharing the same non-zero color.
    properties:
      - color: integer (value > 0)
      - cell_coordinates: list of [row, column] tuples.
      - cell_count: integer (number of cells with this color).
      - bounding_box: tuple (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) encompassing all cells of the shape.
      - bounding_box_area: integer ((max_row - min_row + 1) * (max_col - min_col + 1)).
      - is_solid_rectangle: boolean (True if cell_count == bounding_box_area).

relationships:
  - Input grid contains exactly one shape where `is_solid_rectangle` is True.
  - Input grid contains exactly one shape where `is_solid_rectangle` is False.
  - The output grid is derived from the input grid.

actions:
  - identify_shapes: For each non-zero color in the input grid, find all its cell coordinates.
  - calculate_shape_properties: For each identified shape, calculate its bounding_box, cell_count, bounding_box_area, and determine if it `is_solid_rectangle`.
  - filter_solid_rectangles:
    - Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
    - Find the shape(s) for which `is_solid_rectangle` is True.
    - For each such shape, iterate through its `cell_coordinates`.
    - Set the value of the corresponding cell in the output grid to the `background_color` (0).

input_features:
  - Input grid with background color 0.
  - Two distinct non-zero colors present.
  - One non-zero color forms a solid rectangle.
  - One non-zero color forms a shape that is *not* a solid rectangle.

output_features:
  - Output grid has the same dimensions as the input.
  - Output grid contains the background color (0).
  - Output grid contains the *exact* shape (pixels and color) of the non-rectangular shape from the input.
  - The area previously occupied by the solid rectangular shape in the input grid is replaced with the background color (0) in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid; this will be the basis for the output grid.
2.  Identify all unique non-zero integer colors present in the input grid.
3.  For each unique non-zero color:
    a.  Find the list of all `(row, column)` coordinates where this color appears in the input grid.
    b.  If the list of coordinates is empty, skip to the next color.
    c.  Calculate the minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, and maximum column from the coordinates to define the bounding box.
    d.  Calculate the area of the bounding box (height * width).
    e.  Count the total number of cells found for this color.
    f.  Determine if the shape is a solid rectangle by checking if the cell count is equal to the bounding box area.
    g.  If the shape is a solid rectangle:
        i.  Iterate through the list of `(row, column)` coordinates found in step 3a for this specific color.
        ii. For each coordinate `(r, c)`, set the value of the cell at `(r, c)` in the *output grid* to 0 (the background color).
4.  Return the modified output grid.
