            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial code (`code_00.py`) incorrectly interpreted the transformation. Instead of *removing* the solid rectangular shape, it identified the *non-rectangular* shape and filled its *bounding box* in the output grid. The comparison between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` clearly shows this discrepancy: the non-rectangular shape's area is filled solid in the transformed output, whereas the expected output preserves the original pixels of the non-rectangular shape and removes the pixels of the solid rectangular shape.\n\nThe strategy is to revert to the initial hypothesis derived from the first example:\n1.  Identify all distinct non-zero colored shapes in the input.\n2.  For each shape, determine if it forms a solid rectangle (i.e., its constituent cells perfectly fill its bounding box).\n3.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n4.  Modify the output grid by changing the color of all cells belonging to the identified solid rectangular shape(s) to the background color (0).\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's analyze the shapes in each training example.\n\n"
