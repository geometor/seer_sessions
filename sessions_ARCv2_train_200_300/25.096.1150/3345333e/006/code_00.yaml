task_description: From an input grid containing a background color (0) and exactly two non-zero colored shapes, identify the shape that forms a solid rectangle and the one that does not. Construct an output grid containing only the background color and the non-rectangular shape, preserving its original colors and positions.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing pixels/colors.
    properties:
      - dimensions: [height, width] (e.g., 16x16)
      - background_color: integer (consistently 0 in examples)

  - element: shape
    description: A collection of grid cells sharing the same non-zero color.
    properties:
      - color: integer (non-zero)
      - cell_locations: list of [row, column] coordinates where the shape exists in the input grid.
      - bounding_box: [min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col] encompassing all cell_locations.
      - is_solid_rectangle: boolean # True if the number of cell_locations equals the area of the bounding_box.

relationships:
  - Input grid contains multiple shapes (one background, two non-zero).
  - One non-zero shape `is_solid_rectangle: true`.
  - The other non-zero shape `is_solid_rectangle: false`.
  - The output grid contains the background shape and the non-rectangular shape.

actions:
  - initialize_output_grid: Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background_color.
  - identify_shapes: For each non-zero color in the input grid, find all its cell_locations.
  - calculate_bounding_box: Determine the bounding box for each identified shape.
  - check_solid_rectangle: Determine if a shape `is_solid_rectangle`.
  - filter_and_draw: Identify the shape(s) where `is_solid_rectangle` is false. For each such shape, copy its `cell_locations` and `color` onto the `output_grid`.

input_features:
  - Grid dimensions are fixed within the task.
  - Background color is 0.
  - Exactly two distinct non-zero colors exist.
  - One non-zero color forms a single, solid, axis-aligned rectangle.
  - The other non-zero color forms a shape that is not a solid rectangle.

output_features:
  - Output grid has the same dimensions as the input.
  - Output grid contains the background color (0).
  - Output grid contains only the pixels corresponding to the non-rectangular shape from the input, preserving their original color and position. Pixels belonging *only* to the solid rectangle are replaced by the background color.
