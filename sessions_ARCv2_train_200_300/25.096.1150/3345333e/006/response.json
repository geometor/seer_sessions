            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial analysis identified the core task as removing a solid rectangular shape of one color while preserving another, non-rectangular shape. The provided code implemented this by finding the solid rectangle and setting its cells to the background color (0) in a copy of the input grid.\n\nHowever, the test results show discrepancies (`Match: False`, `Pixels Off > 0`, `Color Count Correct: False`) between the code's output and the expected output, even though the code correctly identifies and targets the solid rectangle for removal.\n\nAnalysis using `tool_code` confirmed that the pixels reported as \"off\" correspond to locations where the non-rectangular shape existed in the input grid but were overwritten with 0 by the code because those locations were also part of the solid rectangle being removed. The expected output retains these pixels belonging to the non-rectangular shape.\n\nThe strategy is to revise the transformation logic: instead of starting with the input grid and *removing* the rectangle, we should start with an empty grid (filled with background color) and *add only* the pixels belonging to the non-rectangular shape(s).\n\n## Metrics\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   Input Colors: 0 (background), 2 (non-rectangle), 3 (solid rectangle)\n*   Shape 3 (Solid Rectangle): Color=3, Coords=16, BBox=(4,0,7,3), Area=16. IsSolid=True.\n*   Shape 2 (Non-Rectangle): Color=2, Coords=38 (in input). IsSolid=False.\n*   Expected Output Colors: 0, 2. Count(0)=218, Count(2)=38.\n*   Code Output Colors: 0, 2. Count(0)=225, Count(2)=31.\n*   Difference: 7 pixels at [(4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,2), (7,2)] are 2 in Expected, 0 in Code Output. These pixels were originally color 2 in the input but were located where the color 3 rectangle was.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   Input Colors: 0 (background), 1 (solid rectangle), 6 (non-rectangle)\n*   Shape 1 (Solid Rectangle): Color=1, Coords=12, BBox=(3,6,5,9), Area=12. IsSolid=True.\n*   Shape 6 (Non-Rectangle): Color=6, Coords=28 (in input). IsSolid=False.\n*   Expected Output Colors: 0, 6. Count(0)=228, Count(6)=28.\n*   Code Output Colors: 0, 6. Count(0)=233, Count(6)=23.\n*   Difference: 5 pixels at [(3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,7), (5,6)] are 6 in Expected, 0 in Code Output. These pixels were originally color 6 in the input but were located where the color 1 rectangle was.\n\n## YAML Fact Sheet\n\n\n"
