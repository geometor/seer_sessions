## Assessment and Strategy

The initial analysis identified the core task as removing a solid rectangular shape of one color while preserving another, non-rectangular shape. The provided code implemented this by finding the solid rectangle and setting its cells to the background color (0) in a copy of the input grid.

However, the test results show discrepancies (`Match: False`, `Pixels Off > 0`, `Color Count Correct: False`) between the code's output and the expected output, even though the code correctly identifies and targets the solid rectangle for removal.

Analysis using `tool_code` confirmed that the pixels reported as "off" correspond to locations where the non-rectangular shape existed in the input grid but were overwritten with 0 by the code because those locations were also part of the solid rectangle being removed. The expected output retains these pixels belonging to the non-rectangular shape.

The strategy is to revise the transformation logic: instead of starting with the input grid and *removing* the rectangle, we should start with an empty grid (filled with background color) and *add only* the pixels belonging to the non-rectangular shape(s).

## Metrics

**Example 1:**

*   Input Colors: 0 (background), 2 (non-rectangle), 3 (solid rectangle)
*   Shape 3 (Solid Rectangle): Color=3, Coords=16, BBox=(4,0,7,3), Area=16. IsSolid=True.
*   Shape 2 (Non-Rectangle): Color=2, Coords=38 (in input). IsSolid=False.
*   Expected Output Colors: 0, 2. Count(0)=218, Count(2)=38.
*   Code Output Colors: 0, 2. Count(0)=225, Count(2)=31.
*   Difference: 7 pixels at [(4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,2), (7,2)] are 2 in Expected, 0 in Code Output. These pixels were originally color 2 in the input but were located where the color 3 rectangle was.

**Example 2:**

*   Input Colors: 0 (background), 1 (solid rectangle), 6 (non-rectangle)
*   Shape 1 (Solid Rectangle): Color=1, Coords=12, BBox=(3,6,5,9), Area=12. IsSolid=True.
*   Shape 6 (Non-Rectangle): Color=6, Coords=28 (in input). IsSolid=False.
*   Expected Output Colors: 0, 6. Count(0)=228, Count(6)=28.
*   Code Output Colors: 0, 6. Count(0)=233, Count(6)=23.
*   Difference: 5 pixels at [(3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,7), (5,6)] are 6 in Expected, 0 in Code Output. These pixels were originally color 6 in the input but were located where the color 1 rectangle was.

## YAML Fact Sheet



```yaml
task_description: From an input grid containing a background color (0) and exactly two non-zero colored shapes, identify the shape that forms a solid rectangle and the one that does not. Construct an output grid containing only the background color and the non-rectangular shape, preserving its original colors and positions.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing pixels/colors.
    properties:
      - dimensions: [height, width] (e.g., 16x16)
      - background_color: integer (consistently 0 in examples)

  - element: shape
    description: A collection of grid cells sharing the same non-zero color.
    properties:
      - color: integer (non-zero)
      - cell_locations: list of [row, column] coordinates where the shape exists in the input grid.
      - bounding_box: [min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col] encompassing all cell_locations.
      - is_solid_rectangle: boolean # True if the number of cell_locations equals the area of the bounding_box.

relationships:
  - Input grid contains multiple shapes (one background, two non-zero).
  - One non-zero shape `is_solid_rectangle: true`.
  - The other non-zero shape `is_solid_rectangle: false`.
  - The output grid contains the background shape and the non-rectangular shape.

actions:
  - initialize_output_grid: Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background_color.
  - identify_shapes: For each non-zero color in the input grid, find all its cell_locations.
  - calculate_bounding_box: Determine the bounding box for each identified shape.
  - check_solid_rectangle: Determine if a shape `is_solid_rectangle`.
  - filter_and_draw: Identify the shape(s) where `is_solid_rectangle` is false. For each such shape, copy its `cell_locations` and `color` onto the `output_grid`.

input_features:
  - Grid dimensions are fixed within the task.
  - Background color is 0.
  - Exactly two distinct non-zero colors exist.
  - One non-zero color forms a single, solid, axis-aligned rectangle.
  - The other non-zero color forms a shape that is not a solid rectangle.

output_features:
  - Output grid has the same dimensions as the input.
  - Output grid contains the background color (0).
  - Output grid contains only the pixels corresponding to the non-rectangular shape from the input, preserving their original color and position. Pixels belonging *only* to the solid rectangle are replaced by the background color.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the dimensions (height, width) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions, initialized entirely with the background color (0).
3.  Identify the unique non-zero colors present in the input grid.
4.  For each unique non-zero color:
    a.  Find all coordinates `(r, c)` in the input grid where this color appears. Store these coordinates.
    b.  If no coordinates were found, continue to the next color.
    c.  Calculate the bounding box (`min_r`, `min_c`, `max_r`, `max_c`) encompassing these coordinates.
    d.  Calculate the area of the bounding box: `area = (max_r - min_r + 1) * (max_c - min_c + 1)`.
    e.  Count the number of coordinates found: `cell_count`.
    f.  Determine if the shape is a solid rectangle by checking if `cell_count` equals `area`.
    g.  If the shape is **not** a solid rectangle:
        i.  Iterate through the stored coordinates `(r, c)` for this non-rectangular shape.
        ii. Set the value of the cell at `(r, c)` in the **output grid** to the current color.
5.  Return the final output grid.
