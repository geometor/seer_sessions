Okay, let's break down the perception and logic for this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of numbers (integers). The grid size appears consistent within each example (16x16 for both `train_1` and `train_2`).
2.  **Colors/Numbers:** The grids contain numerical values representing colors. The number 0 consistently represents the background color. Each input grid features two distinct non-zero colors.
    *   `train_1`: Colors 2 and 3.
    *   `train_2`: Colors 1 and 6.
3.  **Shapes/Objects:** The non-zero colors form distinct shapes or regions within the grid.
    *   In `train_1`, color 3 forms a solid rectangle, while color 2 forms a more complex, somewhat hollow shape.
    *   In `train_2`, color 1 forms a solid rectangle, while color 6 forms a more complex shape.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves selectively removing one of the non-zero colored shapes from the input grid while preserving the other non-zero shape and the background.
5.  **Pattern:** In both examples, the shape that is *removed* is the one that forms a solid rectangle. The shape that is *kept* is the one that does not form a solid rectangle (it might be hollow, irregular, or L-shaped, etc.).

**YAML Fact Sheet:**


```yaml
task_description: Identify and remove solid rectangular shapes of a single color from the input grid, leaving other shapes and the background intact.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      - dimensions: [height, width]
      - cells: collection of cell elements

  - element: cell
    description: A single unit within the grid.
    properties:
      - position: [row, column]
      - color: integer value

  - element: shape
    description: A collection of connected or disconnected cells sharing the same non-zero color.
    properties:
      - color: integer value (non-zero)
      - cell_locations: list of [row, column] coordinates
      - bounding_box: [min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col]
      - is_solid_rectangle: boolean # True if all cells within the bounding box have the shape's color

relationships:
  - A grid contains multiple cells.
  - Cells with the same non-zero color constitute a shape (or potentially multiple shapes of the same color, though not seen in examples).

actions:
  - identify_shapes: Group cells by their non-zero color.
  - calculate_bounding_box: For each identified shape, determine its minimum and maximum row and column indices.
  - check_solid_rectangle: For each shape, verify if the number of cells in the shape equals the area of its bounding box.
  - filter_grid: Create the output grid by copying the input, then changing the color of cells belonging to shapes identified as 'solid rectangles' to the background color (0).

input_features:
  - Input grid contains a background color (0).
  - Input grid contains exactly two non-zero colors.
  - One non-zero color forms a shape that is a solid rectangle.
  - The other non-zero color forms a shape that is not a solid rectangle.

output_features:
  - Output grid retains the background color (0) from the input.
  - Output grid retains the non-rectangular shape from the input.
  - Output grid replaces the solid rectangular shape from the input with the background color (0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all unique non-zero colors present in the input grid.
3.  For each unique non-zero color found:
    a.  Find all cell coordinates `(r, c)` containing this color.
    b.  If no cells are found for this color, continue to the next color.
    c.  Calculate the bounding box of these cells: determine the minimum row (`min_r`), maximum row (`max_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), and maximum column (`max_c`).
    d.  Calculate the area of the bounding box: `area = (max_r - min_r + 1) * (max_c - min_c + 1)`.
    e.  Count the number of cells actually containing this color (`cell_count`).
    f.  Check if the shape forms a solid rectangle: this is true if `cell_count` equals `area`.
    g.  If the shape *is* a solid rectangle:
        i.  Iterate through all the cell coordinates `(r, c)` originally found for this color.
        ii. Set the color of the corresponding cell `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to 0 (the background color).
4.  Return the modified output grid.
