            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified and removed the solid rectangular shape in both training examples. However, it failed to reproduce the expected output accurately because the transformation involves more than just removing the rectangle. The errors observed (mismatched pixels for the remaining shape) indicate that the non-rectangular shape is also modified.\n\nComparing the input and expected output grids reveals that the non-rectangular shape in the output corresponds to the *filled bounding box* of the non-rectangular shape from the input.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the transformation logic:\n1.  Identify all distinct non-zero colored shapes in the input.\n2.  Classify each shape as either a \"solid rectangle\" or \"not a solid rectangle\".\n3.  Identify the color associated with the solid rectangle (`rect_color`) and the color associated with the non-rectangular shape (`non_rect_color`).\n4.  Calculate the bounding box of the non-rectangular shape from the input.\n5.  Create the output grid by:\n    *   Initializing it with the background color (0).\n    *   Filling the calculated bounding box of the non-rectangular shape with `non_rect_color`.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n"
