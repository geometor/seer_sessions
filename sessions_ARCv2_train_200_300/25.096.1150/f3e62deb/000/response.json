Each input grid features a single, distinct object composed of non-zero identical digits, arranged in a 3x3 hollow square pattern, against a background of zeros. The output grid shows the same object relocated to a different position within the grid, while the background remains zero. The object's shape and color (the specific digit) are preserved during the transformation. The movement is always purely horizontal or purely vertical.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
