Grid:
  Type: 2D array of integers
  BackgroundValue: 0

Region:
  Definition: Connected component of non-zero cells (using 8-way connectivity).
  Identification: Use `scipy.ndimage.label` on cells > 0.
  Properties:
    - Cells: Coordinates `(r, c)` belonging to the region.
    - Values: List of integer values at the cell coordinates.
    - ValueCounts: Frequency of each value in the region.
    - ComponentColor (C): The most frequent non-zero value. Assumed to exist if `len(ValueCounts) >= 2`.
    - SeedColor (S): The unique non-zero value that is not C. Assumed to exist if `len(ValueCounts) >= 2`.
    - SeedCell: The cell `(r_s, c_s)` within the region having the SeedColor S.
    - BoundaryCells: Set of cells `(r, c)` in the region where at least one 8-way neighbor has the BackgroundValue (0).
    - InteriorCells: Set of cells `(r, c)` in the region that are neither the SeedCell nor BoundaryCells.

TransformationRule:
  Scope: Applied independently to each identified Region where both C and S exist (i.e., `len(ValueCounts) >= 2`).
  Input: Input Grid
  Output: Output Grid (initialized as a copy of Input Grid)
  Steps:
    1. Identify all Regions.
    2. For each Region:
       a. Calculate ValueCounts.
       b. If `len(ValueCounts) < 2`:
          - Skip transformation for this region (output remains as copied from input).
       c. If `len(ValueCounts) >= 2`:
          - Determine ComponentColor (C) (most frequent).
          - Determine SeedColor (S) (the other color).
          - Find SeedCell `(r_s, c_s)`.
          - Identify BoundaryCells.
          - For each cell `(r, c)` in the Region:
             i. If `(r, c)` is the SeedCell: Set `Output[r, c] = 0`.
             ii. Else if `(r, c)` is in BoundaryCells: Keep `Output[r, c]` as C (no change from initial copy).
             iii. Else (`(r, c)` is an InteriorCell):
                 - Calculate Manhattan distance `d = |r - r_s| + |c - c_s|`.
                 - If `d` is odd: Set `Output[r, c] = 0`.
                 - If `d` is even (`d > 0`): Set `Output[r, c] = SeedColor (S)`.
  UnaffectedCells:
    - Cells with BackgroundValue (0).
    - Cells in Regions where `len(ValueCounts) < 2`.
    - BoundaryCells within transformed regions.
