These regions appear mostly uniform in color, except for one unique cell.\n4.  **Region Color (C):** Within each non-zero region, there's a predominant color (e.g., 2 in `train_1`, 3 in `train_2`, 1, 3, 4 in `train_3`).\n5.  **Seed Cell:** Each region contains exactly one cell whose color (let's call it `S`) is different from the predominant color `C` of that region. This cell acts as a 'seed' or 'origin' for the transformation within its region.\n6.  **Boundary:** The outermost layer of cells in each region (those adjacent to the background 0s) appears to retain its original color `C` in the output.\n7.  **Interior:** The cells inside the boundary, excluding the seed cell, undergo a change.\n8.  **Pattern:** The change inside the region follows a pattern based on the Manhattan distance (`d = |row_diff| + |col_diff|`) from the seed cell's location `(r_s, c_s)`.\n    *   The seed cell itself becomes 0 in the output.\n    *   Interior cells at an odd Manhattan distance (`d % 2 == 1`) from the seed become 0.\n    *   Interior cells at an even, non-zero Manhattan distance (`d > 0 and d % 2 == 0`) from the seed take on the seed color `S`.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
