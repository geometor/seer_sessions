Grid:
  Type: 2D array of integers
  BackgroundValue: 0

Region:
  Definition: Connected component of non-zero cells
  Properties:
    - ComponentColor (C): Most frequent non-zero value in the region
    - SeedCell:
        Exists: True (one per region)
        Color (S): Value different from ComponentColor C
        Location (r_s, c_s): Coordinates of the SeedCell
    - BoundaryCells: Cells in the region adjacent (8-connectivity) to BackgroundValue 0
    - InteriorCells: Cells in the region that are not BoundaryCells and not the SeedCell

Transformation:
  Scope: Applies independently to each Region
  Unaffected:
    - BackgroundCells (value 0)
    - BoundaryCells (retain ComponentColor C)
  Affected:
    - SeedCell: Output value becomes 0
    - InteriorCells:
        Action: Calculate Manhattan distance 'd' from SeedCell location (r_s, c_s)
        Rule:
          - If d is odd: Output value becomes 0
          - If d is even and d > 0: Output value becomes SeedColor S
