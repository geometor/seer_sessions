It also correctly identified the connected components within each region. However, the mapping strategy, based on the closest normalized centroid relative to the *entire grid*, failed. In both examples, this led to an incorrect assignment of colors to the template components, often favoring a single pattern color (color '4' in the provided outputs).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe core issue lies in how the spatial relationship between pattern components and template components is defined and measured. The strategy is to refine the mapping logic:\n\n1.  **Bounding Box Normalization:** Instead of normalizing centroids by the full grid dimensions, normalize them relative to the bounding box of their respective regions (pattern region and template region). This should capture the *relative* position within each cluster of components more accurately.\n2.  **Calculate Bounding Boxes:** Determine the minimum and maximum row and column for the pattern region (all cells with colors 1-7 or 9) and the template region (all cells with color 8).\n3.  **Normalize Centroids within Bounding Boxes:** For each pattern component centroid `(r, c)`, calculate its normalized position `((r - min_r_pattern) / height_pattern, (c - min_c_pattern) / width_pattern)`. Do the same for template component centroids relative to the template bounding box.\n4.  **Re-evaluate Closest Component:** Use the newly normalized centroids to find the closest pattern component for each template component using Euclidean distance.\n5.  **Update Documentation:** Reflect this refined mapping strategy in the facts and natural language program.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's calculate the bounding boxes and normalized centroids for the first example to test the refined strategy.\n"
