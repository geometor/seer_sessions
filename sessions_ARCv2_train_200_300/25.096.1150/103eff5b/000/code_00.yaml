task_elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of single digits.
    properties:
      - rows: integer
      - columns: integer
      - cells: list of lists of integers (0-9)

  - object: pattern_region
    description: An area within the input grid containing non-zero digits, excluding the digit 8.
    properties:
      - colors: set of integers (1-7, 9) present in the region.
      - location: coordinates of the cells belonging to this region.
      - components: list of connected sub-regions within the pattern region, each associated with a single color.

  - object: template_region
    description: An area within the input grid containing only the digit 8.
    properties:
      - color: 8 (constant)
      - location: coordinates of the cells belonging to this region.
      - components: list of connected sub-regions (using 8-connectivity) within the template region.

  - object: background
    description: Cells in the grid with the value 0.

  - type: spatial_mapping
    description: >
      A correspondence exists between the pattern region components and the template region components based on their relative positions within their respective bounding boxes or overall structures.

actions:
  - action: identify_regions
    description: Locate the pattern_region and template_region within the input grid.
  - action: find_components
    description: >
      Identify the connected components within the pattern_region (grouping by color)
      and within the template_region (all color 8). 8-connectivity seems appropriate.
  - action: map_components
    description: >
      Establish a mapping from each template_region component to a pattern_region component.
      This mapping is determined by matching the relative spatial positions (e.g., using normalized centroids or bounding box centers).
  - action: replace_color
    description: >
      Create the output grid by copying the input grid. Then, for each template_region component,
      replace the color (8) of all its cells with the color of the pattern_region component it maps to.
