            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous attempts using component centroids normalized by grid size (in the initial thought process, though not coded correctly) and pixel-wise mapping based on bounding box normalization both failed to produce the correct output. The pixel-wise mapping generated particularly fragmented and incorrect results.\n\nThe core concept seems to involve transferring colors from a \"pattern\" region (non-zero, non-8 digits) to a \"template\" region (digit 8). The expected outputs show that the template regions are filled with solid colors corresponding to parts of the pattern region, maintaining the connectivity of the original template components. This strongly suggests a mapping between **connected components** of the template region and **connected components** of the pattern region.\n\nThe failure likely lies in the specific method used to determine the correspondence (mapping) between these components. The previous attempts used either simple centroid distance (perhaps normalized incorrectly) or bounding-box relative pixel mapping.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-implement Component Mapping:** Revisit the approach of mapping template components to pattern components based on their spatial relationship.\n2.  **Use Centroids:** Calculate the centroid (center of mass) for each connected component in both the pattern and template regions.\n3.  **Normalize Centroids:** Normalize the centroid coordinates (row, column) by dividing by the overall grid dimensions (height, width). This provides a relative position within the entire grid, independent of the size or location of specific bounding boxes.\n4.  **Nearest Neighbor Mapping:** For each template component, find the pattern component whose normalized centroid is closest (using Euclidean distance) to the template component's normalized centroid.\n5.  **Apply Color:** Assign the color of the closest pattern component to the entire corresponding template component in the output grid.\n\nThis strategy focuses on the relative positions of the *entire* components within the grid, which seems more robust than relying on bounding boxes or direct pixel scaling, especially given the shapes observed in the examples.\n\n## Metrics\n\n"
