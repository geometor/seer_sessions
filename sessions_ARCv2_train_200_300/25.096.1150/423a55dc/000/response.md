*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are 2D grids (matrices) containing integer values.
    *   Each input grid contains a single "shape" or "object" composed of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by a background of zeros (digit 0).
    *   The non-zero digit used for the shape varies across different examples (e.g., 8, 6, 3, 2).
    *   The transformation involves moving the shape horizontally within the grid.
    *   The shape itself (its internal structure and the digit it's made of) remains unchanged.
    *   The background (zeros) remains unchanged.
    *   The specific transformation is a horizontal shift to the left. The amount of the shift aligns the leftmost part of the shape with the first column (column index 0) of the grid.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - input_grid: A 2D array of integers representing the initial state.
      - output_grid: A 2D array of integers representing the final state.
      - shape: A collection of connected cells in the input_grid with the same non-zero integer value.
      - background_cells: Cells in the input_grid with a value of 0.
    properties:
      - input_grid.dimensions: [height, width]
      - output_grid.dimensions: [height, width] # Same as input_grid.dimensions
      - shape.value: The non-zero integer value of the cells forming the shape.
      - shape.cells: A list of coordinates [(row1, col1), (row2, col2), ...] for the shape cells.
      - shape.min_column: The smallest column index found among shape.cells.
    actions:
      - find_shape_cells: Identify all non-zero cells in the input_grid.
      - calculate_min_column: Determine the minimum column index among the identified shape cells.
      - initialize_output: Create an output_grid of the same dimensions as the input_grid, filled with zeros.
      - translate_shape: For each shape cell in the input_grid, place its value in the output_grid at a new position shifted horizontally.
    relationships:
      - output_grid is derived from input_grid by applying a transformation only to the shape cells.
      - The horizontal shift amount for each shape cell is calculated as `(- shape.min_column)`.
      - The position `(r, c)` of a shape cell in the input_grid maps to `(r, c - shape.min_column)` in the output_grid.
      - Background cells remain zero in the output_grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a new grid (the output grid) with the same dimensions as the input grid, and initialize all its cells to 0.
    2.  Identify all cells in the input grid that have a non-zero value. Record their row index, column index, and value. These constitute the "shape".
    3.  If no non-zero cells are found, return the initialized (all zero) output grid.
    4.  Find the minimum column index among all the identified non-zero cells. Call this `min_col`.
    5.  For each non-zero cell identified in step 2 with value `v` at input coordinates `(row, col)`:
        a.  Calculate its new column index for the output grid as `new_col = col - min_col`.
        b.  Set the cell at coordinates `(row, new_col)` in the output grid to the value `v`.
    6.  Return the final output grid.
