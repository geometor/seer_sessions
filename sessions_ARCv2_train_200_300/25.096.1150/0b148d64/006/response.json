            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code attempt correctly identified the bottom section of the grid (below the main zero-row separator) but failed on `train_1`. The failure analysis revealed that the assumption of extracting the *left-most* contiguous block within the bottom section was incorrect.\n\n*   **Observation:** In `train_1`, the bottom section contains two distinct patterns (one using `2`s, one using `3`s), separated horizontally by columns containing only zeros within that section. The desired output corresponds to the bounding box of the *right-most* of these patterns.\n*   **Hypothesis:** The transformation rule involves:\n    1.  Identifying the overall bottom section below the main horizontal separator.\n    2.  Locating potential vertical separators (columns of zeros) *within* the vertical bounds of the bottom section's content.\n    3.  Identifying the pattern situated to the right of the *last* such vertical separator.\n    4.  Extracting the bounding box of this right-most pattern.\n*   **Strategy:**\n    1.  Refine the logic to find the vertical range (`min_row`, `max_row`) of *all* non-zero elements in the bottom section.\n    2.  Within this row range, scan columns from right to left to find the first column containing a non-zero element (`max_col`).\n    3.  Continue scanning leftwards from `max_col` to find the first column containing *only* zeros within the `min_row` to `max_row` range. The column immediately to the right of this zero-column separator marks the `min_col` of the target right-most pattern. If no such zero-column separator is found before reaching the overall minimum column of the bottom section, then the entire bottom pattern is the target.\n    4.  Extract the subgrid defined by `min_row`, `max_row`, `min_col` (of the right-most pattern), and `max_col` (of the right-most pattern).\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's analyze `train_1` specifically to confirm the structure.\n"
