Objects:
  - InputGrid:
      Properties:
        - type: 2D array of integers
        - background_value: 0
        - contains: potentially multiple distinct patterns of non-zero integers
        - structure: top patterns separated from bottom patterns by horizontal_separator
  - HorizontalSeparator:
      Properties:
        - type: one or more contiguous rows in InputGrid containing only background_value
        - location: lies between the lowest row of the top patterns and the highest row of the bottom patterns
  - BottomSection:
      Properties:
        - type: region of InputGrid
        - location: all rows below the HorizontalSeparator
        - contains: one or more distinct BottomPatterns
  - VerticalSeparator:
      Properties:
        - type: one or more contiguous columns containing only background_value
        - location: exists within the row-span of a BottomSection and horizontally separates BottomPatterns
  - BottomPattern:
      Properties:
        - type: connected region of non-zero integers within BottomSection
        - location: may be separated from other BottomPatterns by VerticalSeparators
        - bounding_box: defined by min/max row/column containing non-zero elements of the specific pattern
  - TargetPattern:
      Properties:
        - type: the specific BottomPattern selected for output
        - criteria: it is the right-most BottomPattern within the BottomSection (i.e., located to the right of the last VerticalSeparator, or the only pattern if no VerticalSeparator exists within the BottomSection's bounds)
  - OutputGrid:
      Properties:
        - type: 2D array of integers
        - relation: is the subgrid of InputGrid corresponding to the bounding_box of the TargetPattern

Actions:
  - FindHorizontalSeparator: Locate the end row of the HorizontalSeparator above the BottomSection.
  - DefineBottomSection: Identify the rows starting immediately after the HorizontalSeparator.
  - FindBottomSectionBounds: Determine the min/max rows containing non-zero values within the BottomSection.
  - FindLastVerticalSeparator: Within the row bounds of the BottomSection, find the right-most column containing only background_value that separates potential patterns.
  - IdentifyTargetPatternBounds: Determine the min/max column indices for the TargetPattern (right-most pattern). This starts at the column after the LastVerticalSeparator (or the overall min column if no separator exists) and ends at the overall max column of the BottomSection. The rows are the min/max rows of the entire BottomSection's content.
  - ExtractSubgrid: Select the portion of the InputGrid defined by the TargetPattern's bounds (rows and columns).
