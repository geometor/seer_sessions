Objects:
  - InputGrid:
      Properties:
        - type: 2D array of integers
        - contains: two distinct patterns (objects) of non-zero integers
        - separator: patterns are separated vertically by one or more rows of zeros (value 0)
  - OutputGrid:
      Properties:
        - type: 2D array of integers
        - relation: is a subgrid of InputGrid corresponding to the bounding box of the BottomObject
  - TopObject:
      Properties:
        - type: connected region of non-zero integers within InputGrid
        - location: resides entirely above the SeparatorRows
  - BottomObject:
      Properties:
        - type: connected region of non-zero integers within InputGrid
        - location: resides entirely below the SeparatorRows
        - bounding_box: defined by min/max row/column containing non-zero elements *belonging solely to this object*
  - SeparatorRows:
      Properties:
        - type: one or more contiguous rows in InputGrid containing only zeros
        - function: vertically divides InputGrid, separating TopObject and BottomObject

Actions:
  - IdentifySeparator: Find the contiguous block of all-zero rows separating the non-zero patterns. Determine the last row index of this block.
  - IdentifyBottomObjectCoordinates: Locate all non-zero cells (r, c) in the InputGrid where the row index `r` is greater than the Separator's last row index.
  - CalculateBottomObjectBoundingBox: Determine the minimum row (`min_r`), maximum row (`max_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), and maximum column (`max_c`) based *only* on the coordinates identified in the previous step.
  - ExtractSubgrid: Select the rectangular portion of the original InputGrid defined by the calculated bounding box: rows from `min_r` to `max_r` (inclusive) and columns from `min_c` to `max_c` (inclusive).

Relationships:
  - InputGrid contains a TopObject and a BottomObject.
  - SeparatorRows separate TopObject from BottomObject.
  - OutputGrid is the result of ExtractSubgrid applied using the BottomObjectBoundingBox coordinates on the InputGrid.
