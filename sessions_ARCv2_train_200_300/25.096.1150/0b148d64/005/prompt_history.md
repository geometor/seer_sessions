Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input Data:** The input is consistently a grid (matrix) of single-digit integers. The grid contains regions of non-zero numbers separated by regions composed entirely of zeros (`0`). `0` appears to function as a background or empty space.
2.  **Structure:** In each input grid, there are typically two distinct "objects" or patterns formed by non-zero numbers. These objects are separated vertically by one or more rows containing only zeros. One object resides in the upper portion of the grid, and the other resides in the lower portion. Different integers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 8) are used within these objects, potentially representing different colors or types, but the specific value doesn't seem to dictate *which* object is chosen, only the content *of* the chosen object.
3.  **Output Data:** The output is also a grid of integers. It appears to be a subgrid extracted from the input.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve identifying and isolating one of the objects from the input grid based on its vertical position. Specifically, the object located in the *bottom* part of the grid (below the separating zero rows) is selected.
5.  **Extraction Detail:** The output grid corresponds exactly to the bounding box of the selected bottom object within the input grid. This includes all the original numbers (both non-zero and zero) within that rectangular bounding box.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
Objects:
  - InputGrid:
      Properties:
        - type: 2D array of integers
        - contains: multiple distinct patterns of non-zero integers
        - separator: patterns are separated vertically by rows of zeros
  - OutputGrid:
      Properties:
        - type: 2D array of integers
        - relation: is a subgrid of InputGrid
  - Pattern:
      Properties:
        - type: connected region of non-zero integers within InputGrid
        - location: resides either in the top or bottom section relative to separator rows
        - bounding_box: defined by min/max row/column containing non-zero elements of the pattern
  - SeparatorRows:
      Properties:
        - type: one or more contiguous rows in InputGrid containing only zeros
        - function: vertically divides InputGrid into sections containing patterns

Actions:
  - IdentifySeparator: Find the band of all-zero rows dividing the InputGrid.
  - IdentifyBottomPattern: Locate the pattern existing entirely below the SeparatorRows.
  - CalculateBoundingBox: Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices encompassing the non-zero elements of the BottomPattern.
  - ExtractSubgrid: Select the portion of the InputGrid defined by the calculated bounding box.

Relationships:
  - InputGrid contains a TopPattern and a BottomPattern.
  - SeparatorRows separate TopPattern from BottomPattern.
  - OutputGrid is the result of ExtractSubgrid applied to the BottomPattern's BoundingBox within the InputGrid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input into a 2D grid representation.
2.  Scan the grid row by row to find the contiguous block of rows that contain only the background value (`0`). These are the separator rows.
3.  Identify the region of the grid located *below* these separator rows. This is the bottom section.
4.  Within this bottom section, find all cells containing non-zero values.
5.  Determine the minimum row index (`min_row`), maximum row index (`max_row`), minimum column index (`min_col`), and maximum column index (`max_col`) among these non-zero cells. This defines the bounding box of the pattern in the bottom section.
6.  Extract the rectangular subgrid from the original input grid starting at `min_row` and ending at `max_row` (inclusive), and spanning from `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive).
7.  The extracted subgrid is the final output.

## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the separation of the grid into top and bottom sections by zero-rows and the need to extract the bottom section. However, the code failed because the bounding box calculation was too broad horizontally. The previous code calculated the `min_col` and `max_col` based on *all* non-zero elements found below the separator rows.

The failed examples reveal that when the bottom section contains horizontally separated patterns (as seen by columns of zeros splitting non-zero regions in the bottom section), the task requires extracting only the **left-most** pattern's bounding box. The row extent (`min_row`, `max_row`) is still determined by the vertical span of all non-zero elements in the bottom section, but the column extent (`min_col`, `max_col`) must be restricted to the columns occupied by the first contiguous horizontal block of the pattern encountered below the separator.

**Strategy:**

1.  Refine the `find_bottom_object_bounding_box` function (or create a new one).
2.  After identifying the `bottom_section_start_row` and the overall `min_row` and `max_row` for the bottom section, determine the correct `min_col` and `max_col`.
3.  The `min_col` should be the minimum column index of any non-zero element within the relevant rows (`min_row` to `max_row`).
4.  The `max_col` needs careful calculation. It should be the maximum column index belonging to the *same* left-most contiguous block of columns that contains `min_col`. This means scanning columns starting from `min_col` and stopping at the first column that is *entirely zero* within the row range `min_row` to `max_row`.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's analyze the dimensions and bounding boxes:
