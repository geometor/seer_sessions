The grid contains regions of non-zero numbers separated by regions composed entirely of zeros (`0`). `0` appears to function as a background or empty space.\n2.  **Structure:** In each input grid, there are typically two distinct \"objects\" or patterns formed by non-zero numbers. These objects are separated vertically by one or more rows containing only zeros. One object resides in the upper portion of the grid, and the other resides in the lower portion. Different integers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 8) are used within these objects, potentially representing different colors or types, but the specific value doesn't seem to dictate *which* object is chosen, only the content *of* the chosen object.\n3.  **Output Data:** The output is also a grid of integers. It appears to be a subgrid extracted from the input.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve identifying and isolating one of the objects from the input grid based on its vertical position. Specifically, the object located in the *bottom* part of the grid (below the separating zero rows) is selected.\n5.  **Extraction Detail:** The output grid corresponds exactly to the bounding box of the selected bottom object within the input grid. This includes all the original numbers (both non-zero and zero) within that rectangular bounding box.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Scan the grid row by row to find the contiguous block of rows that contain only the background value (`0`). These are the separator rows.\n3.  Identify the region of the grid located *below* these separator rows. This is the bottom section.\n4.  Within this bottom section, find all cells containing non-zero values.\n5.  Determine the minimum row index (`min_row`), maximum row index (`max_row`), minimum column index (`min_col`), and maximum column index (`max_col`) among these non-zero cells. This defines the bounding box of the pattern in the bottom section.\n6.  Extract the rectangular subgrid from the original input grid starting at `min_row` and ending at `max_row` (inclusive), and spanning from `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive).\n7.  The extracted subgrid is the final output."
