Objects:
  - InputGrid:
      Properties:
        - type: 2D array of integers
        - contains: multiple distinct patterns of non-zero integers
        - separator: patterns are separated vertically by rows of zeros
  - OutputGrid:
      Properties:
        - type: 2D array of integers
        - relation: is a subgrid of InputGrid
  - Pattern:
      Properties:
        - type: connected region of non-zero integers within InputGrid
        - location: resides either in the top or bottom section relative to separator rows
        - bounding_box: defined by min/max row/column containing non-zero elements of the pattern
  - SeparatorRows:
      Properties:
        - type: one or more contiguous rows in InputGrid containing only zeros
        - function: vertically divides InputGrid into sections containing patterns

Actions:
  - IdentifySeparator: Find the band of all-zero rows dividing the InputGrid.
  - IdentifyBottomPattern: Locate the pattern existing entirely below the SeparatorRows.
  - CalculateBoundingBox: Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices encompassing the non-zero elements of the BottomPattern.
  - ExtractSubgrid: Select the portion of the InputGrid defined by the calculated bounding box.

Relationships:
  - InputGrid contains a TopPattern and a BottomPattern.
  - SeparatorRows separate TopPattern from BottomPattern.
  - OutputGrid is the result of ExtractSubgrid applied to the BottomPattern's BoundingBox within the InputGrid.
