            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the separation of the grid into top and bottom sections by zero-rows and the need to extract the bottom section. However, the code failed because the bounding box calculation was too broad horizontally. The previous code calculated the `min_col` and `max_col` based on *all* non-zero elements found below the separator rows.\n\nThe failed examples reveal that when the bottom section contains horizontally separated patterns (as seen by columns of zeros splitting non-zero regions in the bottom section), the task requires extracting only the **left-most** pattern's bounding box. The row extent (`min_row`, `max_row`) is still determined by the vertical span of all non-zero elements in the bottom section, but the column extent (`min_col`, `max_col`) must be restricted to the columns occupied by the first contiguous horizontal block of the pattern encountered below the separator.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Refine the `find_bottom_object_bounding_box` function (or create a new one).\n2.  After identifying the `bottom_section_start_row` and the overall `min_row` and `max_row` for the bottom section, determine the correct `min_col` and `max_col`.\n3.  The `min_col` should be the minimum column index of any non-zero element within the relevant rows (`min_row` to `max_row`).\n4.  The `max_col` needs careful calculation. It should be the maximum column index belonging to the *same* left-most contiguous block of columns that contains `min_col`. This means scanning columns starting from `min_col` and stopping at the first column that is *entirely zero* within the row range `min_row` to `max_row`.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze the dimensions and bounding boxes:\n"
