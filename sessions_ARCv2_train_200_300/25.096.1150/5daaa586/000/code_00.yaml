objects:
  - name: Input Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 12x12, 22x22, 14x15)
  - name: Output Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: smaller than Input Grid, determined by extraction rule
  - name: Boundary Columns
    properties:
      - count: 2 (left and right)
      - identification: Based on columns predominantly containing a single distinct non-zero value, marking vertical extents.
      - indices: col1 (leftmost), col2 (rightmost)
  - name: Boundary Rows
    properties:
      - count: 2 (top and bottom)
      - identification: First (row1) and last (row2) rows where all elements between col1 and col2 (inclusive) are non-zero.
      - indices: row1 (topmost), row2 (bottommost)
  - name: Subgrid
    properties:
      - location: Defined by [row1:row2+1, col1:col2+1] slice of Input Grid.
      - content: Becomes the Output Grid.

actions:
  - name: Identify Boundary Columns
    inputs: Input Grid
    outputs: col1, col2
    description: Scan columns to find the leftmost (col1) and rightmost (col2) columns that act as vertical delimiters, often containing a consistent non-zero digit.
  - name: Identify Boundary Rows
    inputs: Input Grid, col1, col2
    outputs: row1, row2
    description: Scan rows to find the first row (row1) and last row (row2) where all elements Input[row, col1:col2+1] are non-zero.
  - name: Extract Subgrid
    inputs: Input Grid, row1, row2, col1, col2
    outputs: Output Grid
    description: Create the Output Grid by selecting the elements from Input Grid within the rectangle defined by row1, row2, col1, and col2.

relationships:
  - Output Grid is a subgrid of Input Grid.
  - The dimensions and content of Output Grid depend on the identified Boundary Rows and Boundary Columns in the Input Grid.
  - Boundary Rows are defined relative to the span between Boundary Columns.
