The core operation appears to be the extraction of a specific rectangular subgrid from the input. The boundaries of this subgrid are determined by identifying two specific columns and two specific rows within the input grid.\n\n1.  **Boundary Columns:** Two columns in the input grid serve as the left and right boundaries. These columns are often characterized by containing a consistent non-zero value vertically (e.g., column of '4's and column of '1's in train_1; column of '3's and '8's in train_2; column of '3's and '4's in train_3). Let's call the index of the leftmost boundary column `col1` and the rightmost `col2`.\n2.  **Boundary Rows:** Two rows in the input grid serve as the top and bottom boundaries. These rows are identified as the first (`row1`) and the last (`row2`) rows where *all* the elements between `col1` and `col2` (inclusive) are non-zero.\n3.  **Extraction:** The output grid is the subgrid of the input grid defined by the rectangle spanning from `row1` to `row2` (inclusive) and `col1` to `col2` (inclusive).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
