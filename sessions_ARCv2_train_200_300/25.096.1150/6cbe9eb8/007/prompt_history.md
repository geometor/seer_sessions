*   **Perception:**
    *   The input is a grid of single digits.
    *   There is a clear repeating background pattern composed of low digits (e.g., `0 1 2 3` or `0 1`).
    *   Embedded within the background are distinct shapes or regions formed by digits other than the background pattern digits (e.g., `8`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`).
    *   One of these shapes acts as an outer frame or boundary.
    *   The output is a smaller grid derived from a specific region of the input.
    *   The output grid seems to capture the content within the identified outer frame.
    *   The background pattern digits within the frame in the input are replaced by `0` in the output, while the frame itself and any other embedded shapes within it are preserved.

*   **Facts:**

          - shape_digits: Integers distinct from background digits (e.g., 8, 3, 4, 5, 6).

        output: final_output_grid
    relationships:
      - The output grid's dimensions and content are determined by the framing_shape identified in the input grid.
      - Digits within the output grid are either preserved from the input (framing shape, other embedded shapes) or replaced with 0 (background pattern digits inside the frame).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Analyze the input grid to identify the repeating background pattern digits (usually low integers like 0, 1, 2, 3).
    2.  Identify all connected components (shapes) formed by digits that are *not* part of the background pattern.
    3.  Determine which of these shapes serves as the "framing shape". This is typically the shape that forms the outermost boundary enclosing other non-background shapes or defines the primary region of interest. (Heuristically, this might be the shape whose bounding box contains most or all other non-background pixels).
    4.  Calculate the bounding box (minimum and maximum row and column indices) of the identified framing shape.
    5.  Create the output grid with dimensions matching the bounding box.
    6.  Iterate through each cell within the bounding box coordinates in the input grid.
    7.  For each cell `(row, col)` within the bounding box:
        *   Get the digit `d` from the input grid at `(row, col)`.
        *   Check if `d` is one of the background pattern digits identified in step 1.
        *   Check if the cell `(row, col)` belongs to the framing shape identified in step 3.
        *   If `d` is a background digit AND the cell `(row, col)` is *not* part of the framing shape, place `0` in the corresponding cell of the output grid.
        *   Otherwise (if `d` is not a background digit, or if it is part of the framing shape), place the original digit `d` in the corresponding cell of the output grid.
    8.  Return the final output grid.

## General Assessment

The previous attempt failed because it incorrectly identified the area for the output grid and the rule for preservation versus replacement with zero. The core issues were:

1.  **Bounding Box Definition:** The bounding box was calculated based on *all* non-background elements, whereas the examples show the output area is defined by the bounding box of a specific "framing" shape.
2.  **Frame Identification:** The concept of "framing cells" being non-background elements on the perimeter of the *global* bounding box was incorrect. The frame is a distinct connected shape within the input.
3.  **Background Definition:** Using a fixed set like {0, 1, 2, 3} for background digits conflicts with Example 2, where '3' forms the frame. The background needs to be defined relative to the identified frame.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  Implement a robust method to identify the primary "framing" shape/component in the input. The most promising heuristic seems to be the largest connected component of non-zero digits.
2.  Determine the bounding box based *only* on this identified framing component.
3.  Define background digits dynamically: 0 is always background, and {1, 2, 3} are background *unless* they are the digit making up the frame.
4.  Apply the transformation: within the frame's bounding box, replace background digits with 0, *unless* the cell is part of the frame component itself. Keep all other digits (frame digits and other non-background digits).

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's gather metrics to confirm the new strategy.

The metrics calculation seems flawed. The `ndimage.label` on `non_zero_mask` is creating one giant component for *all* non-zero digits combined, including the background digits 1, 2, 3. This is not correctly identifying distinct objects. The frame digit is consistently identified as '1' because '1' is present everywhere and connects all other non-zero elements.

Let's redefine "objects" as connected components of digits *not* in the set {0, 1, 2, 3}. Then find the largest of *these* components.

**Revised Metrics Calculation Plan:**

1.  Define potential background digits P = {0, 1, 2, 3}.
2.  Create a mask where input grid digits are NOT in P.
3.  Find connected components on *this* mask. These are the "non-background objects".
4.  Find the largest component among these objects (by pixel count). This is the likely frame. Record its digit (`frame_digit`) and coordinates (`frame_coords`).
5.  Calculate the bounding box of `frame_coords`. Check if its dimensions match the output dimensions.
6.  Define the actual background digits B = {0} union {d in {1, 2, 3} where d != frame_digit}.
7.  Report the findings.
