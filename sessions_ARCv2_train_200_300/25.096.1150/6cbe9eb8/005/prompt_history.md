*   **Perception:**
    *   The input is a grid of single digits.
    *   There is a clear repeating background pattern composed of low digits (e.g., `0 1 2 3` or `0 1`).
    *   Embedded within the background are distinct shapes or regions formed by digits other than the background pattern digits (e.g., `8`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`).
    *   One of these shapes acts as an outer frame or boundary.
    *   The output is a smaller grid derived from a specific region of the input.
    *   The output grid seems to capture the content within the identified outer frame.
    *   The background pattern digits within the frame in the input are replaced by `0` in the output, while the frame itself and any other embedded shapes within it are preserved.

*   **Facts:**

          - shape_digits: Integers distinct from background digits (e.g., 8, 3, 4, 5, 6).

        output: final_output_grid
    relationships:
      - The output grid's dimensions and content are determined by the framing_shape identified in the input grid.
      - Digits within the output grid are either preserved from the input (framing shape, other embedded shapes) or replaced with 0 (background pattern digits inside the frame).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Analyze the input grid to identify the repeating background pattern digits (usually low integers like 0, 1, 2, 3).
    2.  Identify all connected components (shapes) formed by digits that are *not* part of the background pattern.
    3.  Determine which of these shapes serves as the "framing shape". This is typically the shape that forms the outermost boundary enclosing other non-background shapes or defines the primary region of interest. (Heuristically, this might be the shape whose bounding box contains most or all other non-background pixels).
    4.  Calculate the bounding box (minimum and maximum row and column indices) of the identified framing shape.
    5.  Create the output grid with dimensions matching the bounding box.
    6.  Iterate through each cell within the bounding box coordinates in the input grid.
    7.  For each cell `(row, col)` within the bounding box:
        *   Get the digit `d` from the input grid at `(row, col)`.
        *   Check if `d` is one of the background pattern digits identified in step 1.
        *   Check if the cell `(row, col)` belongs to the framing shape identified in step 3.
        *   If `d` is a background digit AND the cell `(row, col)` is *not* part of the framing shape, place `0` in the corresponding cell of the output grid.
        *   Otherwise (if `d` is not a background digit, or if it is part of the framing shape), place the original digit `d` in the corresponding cell of the output grid.
    8.  Return the final output grid.

Transformation Rule:
1.  Identify the most frequent digits in the input grid, considering them as the background pattern digits.
2.  Create a binary mask where non-background digits are marked as 1 and background digits as 0.
3.  Find all connected components (shapes) of non-background digits using 8-way connectivity.
4.  Identify the 'framing' component: this is typically the component whose bounding box encloses all or most other non-background components, or simply the component with the largest bounding box area (width * height).
5.  Determine the bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) specifically for this framing component. This defines the dimensions and location of the output grid relative to the input.
6.  Create the output grid with dimensions derived from the framing component's bounding box.
7.  Iterate through each cell within the framing component's bounding box in the input grid.
8.  For each input cell (r_in, c_in) corresponding to an output cell (r_out, c_out):
    a. Get the value `v` from the input grid at (r_in, c_in).
    b. Check if `v` is one of the identified background digits.
    c. Check if the input cell (r_in, c_in) belongs to the set of coordinates making up the identified framing component.
    d. If `v` is a background digit AND the cell (r_in, c_in) is *not* part of the framing component, set the output cell (r_out, c_out) to 0.
    e. Otherwise (if `v` is not a background digit, or if it *is* part of the framing component), copy the value `v` to the output cell (r_out, c_out).
9.  Return the final output grid.

## General Assessment

The previous code failed on all training examples, primarily due to incorrect identification of the relevant subgrid (bounding box) and the framing elements. The outputs had incorrect dimensions, indicating the logic for selecting the area of interest was flawed. The strategy was based on finding the connected component with the largest bounding box, which doesn't necessarily correspond to the overall frame structure seen in the examples.

The new strategy focuses on:
1.  Identifying background digits (heuristically {0, 1, 2, 3} if present).
2.  Finding the bounding box that encloses *all* non-background elements.
3.  Identifying the non-background elements lying on the *perimeter* of this global bounding box as the "frame".
4.  Extracting the subgrid defined by the global bounding box.
5.  Transforming the extracted subgrid: preserve frame elements and other non-background elements, replace internal background elements with 0.

This approach directly addresses the dimension mismatch issue by using the global bounding box and correctly identifies the frame based on its position relative to all non-background activity.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's confirm the assumed background digits and calculate the bounding box of all non-background elements for each example.
