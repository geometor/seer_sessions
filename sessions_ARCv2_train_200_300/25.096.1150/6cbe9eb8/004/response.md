## General Assessment

The previous code failed on all training examples, primarily due to incorrect identification of the relevant subgrid (bounding box) and the framing elements. The outputs had incorrect dimensions, indicating the logic for selecting the area of interest was flawed. The strategy was based on finding the connected component with the largest bounding box, which doesn't necessarily correspond to the overall frame structure seen in the examples.

The new strategy focuses on:
1.  Identifying background digits (heuristically {0, 1, 2, 3} if present).
2.  Finding the bounding box that encloses *all* non-background elements.
3.  Identifying the non-background elements lying on the *perimeter* of this global bounding box as the "frame".
4.  Extracting the subgrid defined by the global bounding box.
5.  Transforming the extracted subgrid: preserve frame elements and other non-background elements, replace internal background elements with 0.

This approach directly addresses the dimension mismatch issue by using the global bounding box and correctly identifies the frame based on its position relative to all non-background activity.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's confirm the assumed background digits and calculate the bounding box of all non-background elements for each example.
