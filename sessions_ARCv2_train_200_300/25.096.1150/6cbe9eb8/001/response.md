1.  Identify the set of background digits (typically low integers like 0, 1, 2, 3 forming a repeating pattern).
2.  Locate all cells in the input grid containing non-background digits.
3.  Determine the bounding box (minimum and maximum row and column indices) that encloses all these non-background cells.
4.  Identify the "framing cells" which are the non-background cells located exactly on the perimeter of this bounding box.
5.  Create the output grid with dimensions matching the bounding box size.
6.  Iterate through each cell within the bounding box area of the input grid.
7.  For each corresponding cell in the output grid:
    *   If the original input cell contains a background digit AND was *not* identified as a framing cell, set the output cell value to 0.
    *   Otherwise, copy the original digit from the input cell to the output cell.
8.  Return the resulting output grid.
