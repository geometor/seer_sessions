Task: Grid Color Transformation

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Contains digits representing colors.
    - Has a dominant background color (most frequent).
    - Contains a central pattern object composed of non-background colors.

Output:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Derived from the input grid.
    - Retains the original central pattern object.
    - Modifies some background cells adjacent to specific parts of the pattern.

Objects:
  - Background: The most frequent digit in the input grid.
  - Pattern:
    - Composed of non-background digits.
    - Has a 'structure' color (more frequent non-background digit).
    - Has an 'inner/frame' color (less frequent non-background digit).

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Cells are considered adjacent if they share an edge or a corner (8 neighbors).

Actions:
  - Identify Colors: Determine background, structure, and inner/frame colors based on frequency.
  - Frame Creation:
    - Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
    - If a cell contains the background color:
      - Check its 8 neighbors in the input grid.
      - If any neighbor contains the 'structure' color:
        - Change the corresponding output cell to the 'inner/frame' color.
  - Preservation: Cells not meeting the framing condition retain their original input color in the output.
