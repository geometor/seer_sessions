Sometimes a quadrant may contain multiple disjoint shapes of color '2'.\n    *   The final color of a shape (or shapes) in a quadrant depends on a comparison between shapes in diagonally opposite quadrants (TL vs BR, TR vs BL).\n    *   The comparison involves both the spatial pattern of the '2's within the shapes and their size (number of '2' cells).\n\n*   **YAML Fact Document:**\n    "

Identify all distinct connected shapes formed by cells with color 2 in the input grid.\n    3.  For each shape, determine its primary quadrant (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) based on its position (e.g., center of bounding box relative to grid center).\n    4.  Group the shapes by quadrant. If a quadrant contains multiple shapes, treat them as a single logical entity: calculate a combined pattern (representing all '2's in that quadrant relative to a common bounding box or origin) and a total size (sum of '2's in all shapes within that quadrant). If a quadrant has no shape of color 2, its pattern is empty and size is 0.\n    5.  Define the shape entities for each quadrant: `TL_Shape`, `TR_Shape`, `BL_Shape`, `BR_Shape`, along with their respective patterns (`P_TL`, `P_TR`, `P_BL`, `P_BR`) and sizes (`S_TL`, `S_TR`, `S_BL`, `S_BR`).\n    6.  Compare the Top-Left and Bottom-Right shapes:\n        *   If `P_TL` is identical to `P_BR`: Assign output color 2 to `TL_Shape` and output color 3 to `BR_Shape`.\n        *   If `P_TL` is different from `P_BR`:\n            *   If `S_TL > S_BR`: Assign output color 3 to `TL_Shape` and output color 8 to `BR_Shape`.\n            *   If `S_TL <= S_BR`: Assign output color 8 to `TL_Shape` and output color 3 to `BR_Shape`.\n    7.  Compare the Top-Right and Bottom-Left shapes:\n        *   If `P_TR` is identical to `P_BL`: Assign output color 8 to `TR_Shape` and output color 8 to `BL_Shape`.\n        *   If `P_TR` is different from `P_BL`:\n            *   If `S_TR > S_BL`: Assign output color 8 to `TR_Shape` and output color 2 to `BL_Shape`.\n            *   If `S_TR <= S_BL`: Assign output color 2 to `TR_Shape` and output color 8 to `BL_Shape`.\n    8.  For every original shape identified in step 2, find its assigned output color based on its quadrant (determined in step 6 or 7) and update the color of all its constituent cells in the output grid to this assigned color.\n    9.  Return the modified output grid."
