The input grid contains single-digit integers (0-9), where 0 represents an empty cell, and non-zero digits represent filled cells. The output grid is derived from the input grid by modifying some of the zero cells. The core transformation appears to operate vertically, within each column independently. Non-zero numbers seem to \"propagate\" or \"fill\" downwards into the zero cells below them, but only until another non-zero number is encountered in the same column. Zeros above the topmost non-zero number in a column remain zero, and zeros below the bottommost non-zero number also remain zero.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
