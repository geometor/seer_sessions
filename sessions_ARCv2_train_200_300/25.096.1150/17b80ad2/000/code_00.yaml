Task: Grid Transformation - Columnar Fill Down

Elements:
  - Object: Grid
    Properties:
      - rows: Integer (number of rows)
      - columns: Integer (number of columns)
      - cells: Matrix of Cell objects
  - Object: Cell
    Properties:
      - row: Integer (y-coordinate)
      - column: Integer (x-coordinate)
      - value: Integer (0-9)
  - Object: Column
    Properties:
      - index: Integer
      - cells: List of Cell objects in that column, ordered top-to-bottom
  - Object: Number
    Properties:
      - value: Integer (1-9, non-zero)
      - location: Cell

Relationships:
  - Vertical Adjacency: Cells within the same column can be above or below each other.
  - Containment: A Grid contains Columns; a Column contains Cells.

Actions:
  - Identify Non-Zero Cells: Find all cells within a column that have a value > 0.
  - Fill Downwards: For a given non-zero cell, change the value of zero cells directly below it in the same column.
  - Stop Filling: The downward fill stops when another non-zero cell is encountered in the same column or the grid boundary is reached.

Transformation Rule Summary:
  - Process each column independently.
  - Within a column, iterate from the top row downwards.
  - Keep track of the 'current fill value', initially null or zero.
  - When a non-zero cell is encountered, update the 'current fill value' to this cell's value.
  - If a cell is zero and the 'current fill value' is non-zero, change the cell's value to the 'current fill value'.
  - The output grid reflects these filled values.
