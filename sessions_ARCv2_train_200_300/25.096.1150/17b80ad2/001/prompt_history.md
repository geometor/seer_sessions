**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 2D grid (matrix) of integers. The input grid contains single-digit integers (0-9), where 0 represents an empty cell, and non-zero digits represent filled cells. The output grid is derived from the input grid by modifying some of the zero cells. The core transformation appears to operate vertically, within each column independently. Non-zero numbers seem to "propagate" or "fill" downwards into the zero cells below them, but only until another non-zero number is encountered in the same column. Zeros above the topmost non-zero number in a column remain zero, and zeros below the bottommost non-zero number also remain zero.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation - Columnar Fill Down

Elements:
  - Object: Grid
    Properties:
      - rows: Integer (number of rows)
      - columns: Integer (number of columns)
      - cells: Matrix of Cell objects
  - Object: Cell
    Properties:
      - row: Integer (y-coordinate)
      - column: Integer (x-coordinate)
      - value: Integer (0-9)
  - Object: Column
    Properties:
      - index: Integer
      - cells: List of Cell objects in that column, ordered top-to-bottom
  - Object: Number
    Properties:
      - value: Integer (1-9, non-zero)
      - location: Cell

Relationships:
  - Vertical Adjacency: Cells within the same column can be above or below each other.
  - Containment: A Grid contains Columns; a Column contains Cells.

Actions:
  - Identify Non-Zero Cells: Find all cells within a column that have a value > 0.
  - Fill Downwards: For a given non-zero cell, change the value of zero cells directly below it in the same column.
  - Stop Filling: The downward fill stops when another non-zero cell is encountered in the same column or the grid boundary is reached.

Transformation Rule Summary:
  - Process each column independently.
  - Within a column, iterate from the top row downwards.
  - Keep track of the 'current fill value', initially null or zero.
  - When a non-zero cell is encountered, update the 'current fill value' to this cell's value.
  - If a cell is zero and the 'current fill value' is non-zero, change the cell's value to the 'current fill value'.
  - The output grid reflects these filled values.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each column of the grid, from left to right (index `j` from 0 to `num_columns - 1`).
3.  For the current column `j`, initialize a variable `current_fill_value` to 0.
4.  Iterate through each row of the current column `j`, from top to bottom (index `i` from 0 to `num_rows - 1`).
5.  Examine the value of the cell at `(i, j)` in the *input* grid.
6.  If the input cell value at `(i, j)` is non-zero:
    *   Update `current_fill_value` to this non-zero value.
7.  Else (if the input cell value at `(i, j)` is zero):
    *   If `current_fill_value` is non-zero, set the value of the cell at `(i, j)` in the *output* grid to `current_fill_value`.
8.  After iterating through all rows in the column, proceed to the next column.
9.  Once all columns have been processed, the output grid contains the final transformed state.
