            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code successfully identified the background color, source cell, and a reference zero cell. It correctly determined a primary diagonal propagation direction based on the relative position of the source and zero cells. However, the code failed because it assumed the transformation only involved painting a single diagonal line in that direction, stopping at the first non-background cell encountered.\n\nThe comparison between the expected and transformed outputs reveals that the transformation actually paints a filled shape, resembling a parallelogram or a \"shadow\" cast by the source cell. The orientation and extent of this shadow are determined by the primary diagonal direction derived from the source-zero relationship. The shape seems to be formed by combining steps in the primary diagonal direction with steps along one of the cardinal axes (either horizontal or vertical, forming the second side of the parallelogram).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Direction Calculation:** Re-evaluate how the two key directions defining the parallelogram are determined. D1 (diagonal) seems robustly calculated as `(sign(sr-zr), sign(sc-zc))`. D2 (axis-aligned) needs a clearer rule; the previous attempts were inconsistent. Let's hypothesize D2 is determined by which component of the source-zero vector `(dr, dc)` has the larger magnitude: if `abs(dr) >= abs(dc)`, D2 is `(sign(dr), 0)`; otherwise, D2 is `(0, sign(dc))`. We must handle the sign(0) case; let's define `sign(0)=1` for this purpose, or assume `dr, dc` are non-zero, or refine based on multiple zeros. *Correction based on re-analysis in thought block:* The D2 selection seems more complex, maybe related to closest zero or specific zero patterns. However, the examples consistently show D2=(1,0) for T1/T2 (D1=(1,-1)/(1,1)) and D2=(0,1) for T3 (D1=(-1,1)). A simpler rule might be: D2 = `(ddr, 0)` if `ddr != 0`, else `(0, ddc)`. *Let's re-test this simpler rule:*\n    *   T1: D1=(1,-1). `ddr=1`. D2=(1,0). Matches observed.\n    *   T2: D1=(1,1). `ddr=1`. D2=(1,0). Matches observed.\n    *   T3: D1=(-1,1). `ddr=-1`. D2=(-1,0). *Does not match observed (0,1)*.\n    *   Okay, the rule needs more thought. Let's stick to the observed D2 for now: `(1,0)` for T1/T2, `(0,1)` for T3. This seems related to the primary *direction* rather than just the vector components. D1=(+,-) -> D2=(+,0). D1=(+,+) -> D2=(+,0). D1=(-,+) -> D2=(0,+). It looks like D2 might be `(abs(ddr), 0)` if `ddr != 0` else `(0, abs(ddc))`. *Re-test:*\n    *   T1: D1=(1,-1). D2=(1,0). Matches.\n    *   T2: D1=(1,1). D2=(1,0). Matches.\n    *   T3: D1=(-1,1). D2=(|-1|,0)=(1,0). *Does not match observed (0,1)*.\n    *   **Final Attempt Rule for D2:** D2 seems to be the axis-aligned step that moves *away* from the zero cell quadrant, using the *row* component preferentially? T1: D1=(1,-1), src below zero -> D2=(1,0). T2: D1=(1,1), src below zero -> D2=(1,0). T3: D1=(-1,1), src above zero -> D2=(0,1). Maybe: If `ddr != 0`, D2 is `(ddr, 0)`. If `ddr == 0` (implies vertical alignment), D2 is `(0, ddc)`. If `ddc == 0` (implies horizontal alignment), D2 is `(ddr, 0)`. This covers all cases and seems to fit T1 & T2. For T3: D1=(-1, 1), `ddr = -1`, so D2 should be `(-1, 0)`. Still doesn't match.\n    *   Let's assume the Coder can find the correct D1 and D2 based on examples, and focus the NL program on the *shape generation* using D1 and D2.\n\n2.  **Implement Shape Filling:** Modify the core logic. Instead of stepping along a single line, the algorithm needs to fill the parallelogram defined by S, D1, and D2. This can be done by iterating through combinations of steps `k*D1 + l*D2` (where `k>=0, l>=0, k+l>0`), checking bounds and the *original* background color condition for each potential cell `C`, and coloring it if valid.\n3.  **Stopping Condition:** The filling stops implicitly when the steps lead outside the grid bounds or try to color a cell that wasn't originally the background color.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nWe need to confirm the Source, Zero, Background, D1, and the observed D2 for each example.\n\n"
