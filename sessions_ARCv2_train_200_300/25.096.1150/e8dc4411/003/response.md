"""
Transforms the input grid by identifying a source cell, a background color, and a zero cell. 
It determines a primary diagonal propagation direction (D1) based on the relative position of the source and zero cells.
It determines a secondary axis-aligned propagation direction (D2) based on D1 (using patterns observed in training data).
Starting from the source cell, it performs a fill operation using steps D1 and D2. 
Cells are colored with the source color if and only if they are within bounds and their original color in the input grid was the background color.
The fill expands like a breadth-first search restricted to D1 and D2 steps.
