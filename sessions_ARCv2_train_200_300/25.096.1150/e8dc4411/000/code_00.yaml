task_description: Propagate a source color diagonally across the background color, starting from an initial source cell. The direction of propagation is determined by the relative position of the source cell to nearby zero cells.

elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 13x15, 12x14, 12x16)
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - location: (row, column)
      - color: integer
  - object: background_color
    properties:
      - identified_by: most frequent color in the input grid
  - object: source_cell
    properties:
      - identified_by: the single cell in the input whose color is not the background color and not zero
      - color: source_color (e.g., 3, 2, 8)
      - location: (source_row, source_col)
  - object: zero_cell
    properties:
      - identified_by: cells with color 0 in the input grid
      - location: (zero_row, zero_col)

relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    between: source_cell, zero_cell
    determines: propagation_direction
    details: The sign of the vector (source_row - zero_row, source_col - zero_col) defines the step vector (ddr, ddc) for propagation.
  - type: adjacency
    between: cells along the propagation path
    details: Each new cell is adjacent (diagonally) to the previous one.
  - type: boundary_constraint
    on: propagation_path
    details: Propagation stops if the next step is outside the grid.
  - type: color_constraint
    on: propagation_path
    details: Propagation stops if the next cell does not contain the background_color.

actions:
  - action: identify_background_color
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: background_color
  - action: find_source_cell
    inputs: input_grid, background_color
    outputs: source_cell (location and color)
  - action: find_any_zero_cell
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: zero_cell location (any one is sufficient)
  - action: determine_propagation_direction
    inputs: source_cell_location, zero_cell_location
    outputs: step_vector (ddr, ddc)
  - action: propagate_color
    inputs: grid, source_cell, step_vector, background_color
    outputs: modified_grid
    process: Iteratively move from the current cell by the step_vector, changing background cells to the source_color until a boundary or non-background cell is encountered.

output_generation:
  - process: Start with a copy of the input grid. Identify background, source, and zero elements. Determine propagation direction. Execute the propagate_color action. The resulting grid is the output.
