This color fills most of the grid initially.\n3.  **Foreground Objects:** There are distinct \"objects\" or patterns made of colors different from the background. These often include the color 0 and one other unique non-background color (3 in train\\_1, 2 in train\\_2, 8 in train\\_3).\n4.  **Source Cell:** In each input grid, there appears to be a single cell with a unique color (neither background nor 0). This cell seems to be the origin or \"source\" of the transformation.\n5.  **Zero Cells:** Cells with the color 0 are present in the input near the source cell. Their position relative to the source cell seems important.\n6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves extending a line or path of the \"source\" color diagonally from the source cell's initial position. The original foreground objects (including the 0s and the initial source cell) remain unchanged.\n7.  **Propagation Rule:** The new cells are added iteratively. The direction of propagation (Up-Left, Up-Right, Down-Left, Down-Right) appears determined by the relative position of the source cell to the zero cells. The propagation continues until it hits the grid boundary or a cell that doesn't contain the background color.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

Identify the `background_color` by finding the most frequent integer value in the input grid.\n3.  Find the `source_cell` by locating the unique cell whose color is neither the `background_color` nor 0. Record its color as `source_color` and its location as (`current_row`, `current_col`).\n4.  Find the location (`zero_row`, `zero_col`) of any cell containing the value 0.\n5.  Calculate the raw direction vector components: `dr = current_row - zero_row` and `dc = current_col - zero_col`.\n6.  Determine the step vector (`ddr`, `ddc`) for propagation: `ddr` is the sign of `dr` (-1 if negative, 1 if positive or zero), and `ddc` is the sign of `dc` (-1 if negative, 1 if positive or zero).\n7.  Begin a loop:\n    a.  Calculate the coordinates of the next cell in the propagation path: `next_row = current_row + ddr`, `next_col = current_col + ddc`.\n    b.  Check if (`next_row`, `next_col`) is within the bounds of the grid. If not, terminate the loop.\n    c.  Check the color of the cell at (`next_row`, `next_col`) in the current state of the output grid. If the color is not the `background_color`, terminate the loop.\n    d.
