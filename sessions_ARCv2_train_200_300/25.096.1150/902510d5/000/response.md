Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) containing non-negative integers. 0 likely represents a background color/state.
2.  **Core Transformation:** The process involves selectively keeping certain numbers from the input, removing others, and adding a new pattern of numbers to the grid.
3.  **Number Roles:** Different numbers seem to play distinct roles:
    *   **Persistent Color (P):** One color appears to be preserved from input to output. This seems to be the most frequently occurring non-zero color in the input grid.
    *   **Trigger Color (N):** Another color seems to act as a trigger for the transformation. This appears to be the minimum non-zero color present in the input, excluding the persistent color `P`. This trigger color exists at a specific location but is removed in the output.
    *   **Fill Color (F):** A specific color is used to draw a new pattern in the output grid. This color seems determined by the set of input colors excluding 0, `P`, and `N`. Specifically, it appears to be the *most frequent* color among these remaining colors (with ties broken by choosing the smallest color value).
    *   **Other Colors:** All other non-zero colors present in the input (that are not `P`, `N`, or `F`) are removed (set to 0) in the output.
4.  **Pattern Generation:** A new geometric pattern using the fill color `F` is introduced. The shape and location of this pattern seem to depend uniquely on the value of the fill color `F`.
    *   `F=4`: A small L-shape appears near the original location of the trigger color `N`.
    *   `F=2`: A large triangle pattern appears in the bottom-left corner.
    *   `F=6`: A large triangle pattern appears in the bottom-right corner.
    *   `F=7`: A large triangle pattern appears in the top-left corner.
