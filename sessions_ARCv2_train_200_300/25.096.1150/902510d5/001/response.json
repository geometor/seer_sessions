P (Persistent): The most frequent non-zero color. Ties are broken by selecting the smallest color value among those tied for the highest frequency.\n2. N (Trigger): The smallest non-zero color value present in the grid that is not equal to P. Its location is noted (specifically the first occurrence if there are multiple, though examples suggest uniqueness).\n3. F (Fill): The most frequent non-zero color among the remaining colors (i.e., excluding 0, P, and N). Ties are broken by selecting the smallest color value among those tied for the highest frequency within this subset.\n\nThe output grid is generated through the following steps:\n1. Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with zeros.\n2. Identify the locations of all cells containing the persistent color P in the input grid. Copy the color P to these same locations in the output grid.\n3. Determine the specific geometric pattern associated with the fill color F:\n    - If F = 4: The pattern is a 2x2 'L' shape (missing the top-left cell). It is positioned such that its bottom-right cell coincides with the location of the trigger color N found earlier.\n    - If F = 2: The pattern is a solid right triangle located in the bottom-left corner of the grid. It has a height and base of 5 cells.\n    - If F = 6: The pattern is a solid right triangle located in the bottom-right corner of the grid. It has a height and base of 4 cells.\n    - If F = 7: The pattern is a solid right triangle located in the top-left corner of the grid. It has a height and base of 5 cells.\n4. Draw the determined pattern onto the output grid using the fill color F. This drawing step overwrites any values previously placed in the output grid at the corresponding locations (including any P colors).\n5. The final output grid contains the preserved P colors and the drawn F pattern, with all other cells remaining zero. Colors from the input grid that are neither P nor N nor F are effectively removed.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef get_color_stats(grid: list[list[int]]) -> tuple[collections.Counter, collections.defaultdict]:\n    \"\"\"Counts non-zero colors and finds all locations for each color.\"\"\"\n    counts = collections.Counter()\n    # defaultdict stores a list of (row, col) tuples for each color\n    locations = collections.defaultdict(list)\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            color = grid[r][c]\n            if color != 0:\n                counts[color] += 1\n                locations[color].append((r, c))\n    return counts, locations\n\ndef find_p_color(counts: collections.Counter) -> int | None:\n    \"\"\"Finds the persistent color P (most frequent, tie-break with min value).\"\"\"\n    if not counts:\n        return None # No non-zero colors found\n\n    max_freq = 0\n    p_candidates = []\n    # Find the maximum frequency among all non-zero colors\n    for freq in counts.values():\n        if freq > max_freq:\n            max_freq = freq\n    \n    # Collect all colors that have this maximum frequency\n    for color, freq in counts.items():\n        if freq == max_freq:\n            p_candidates.append(color)\n\n    # Return the smallest color value among the candidates\n    return min(p_candidates) if p_candidates else None\n\ndef find_n_color_and_loc(counts: collections.Counter, locations: collections.defaultdict, p_color: int | None) -> tuple[int | None, tuple[int, int] | None]:\n    \"\"\"Finds the trigger color N (min non-zero != P) and its first location.\"\"\"\n    n_candidates = []\n    # Collect all non-zero colors that are not the P color\n    for color in counts:\n        if p_color is None or color != p_color:\n            n_candidates.append(color)\n\n    if not n_candidates:\n        # This case occurs if there are no non-zero colors or only P color exists\n        return None, None\n\n    # N is the minimum value among the candidates\n    n_color = min(n_candidates)\n    # Get the location list for N; return the first location found.\n    n_locs = locations.get(n_color)\n    n_loc = n_locs[0] if n_locs else None # Return first location if list exists\n    return n_color, n_loc\n\n\ndef find_f_color(counts: collections.Counter, p_color: int | None, n_color: int | None) -> int | None:\n    \"\"\"Finds the fill color F (most frequent of remaining, tie-break with min value).\"\"\"\n    remaining_counts = collections.Counter()\n    # Create a counter for colors that are neither P nor N\n    for color, freq in counts.items():\n        is_p = (p_color is not None and color == p_color)\n        is_n = (n_color is not None and color == n_color)\n        if color != 0 and not is_p and not is_n:\n            remaining_counts[color] = freq\n\n    if not remaining_counts:\n        # No colors remain after excluding P and N\n        return None \n\n    max_freq = 0\n    f_candidates = []\n    # Find the maximum frequency among the remaining colors\n    for freq in remaining_counts.values():\n"
