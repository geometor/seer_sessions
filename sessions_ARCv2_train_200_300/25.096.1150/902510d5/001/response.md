The transformation identifies three key colors from the input grid based on frequency and value:
1. P (Persistent): The most frequent non-zero color. Ties are broken by selecting the smallest color value among those tied for the highest frequency.
2. N (Trigger): The smallest non-zero color value present in the grid that is not equal to P. Its location is noted (specifically the first occurrence if there are multiple, though examples suggest uniqueness).
3. F (Fill): The most frequent non-zero color among the remaining colors (i.e., excluding 0, P, and N). Ties are broken by selecting the smallest color value among those tied for the highest frequency within this subset.

The output grid is generated through the following steps:
1. Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with zeros.
2. Identify the locations of all cells containing the persistent color P in the input grid. Copy the color P to these same locations in the output grid.
3. Determine the specific geometric pattern associated with the fill color F:
    - If F = 4: The pattern is a 2x2 'L' shape (missing the top-left cell). It is positioned such that its bottom-right cell coincides with the location of the trigger color N found earlier.
    - If F = 2: The pattern is a solid right triangle located in the bottom-left corner of the grid. It has a height and base of 5 cells.
    - If F = 6: The pattern is a solid right triangle located in the bottom-right corner of the grid. It has a height and base of 4 cells.
    - If F = 7: The pattern is a solid right triangle located in the top-left corner of the grid. It has a height and base of 5 cells.
4. Draw the determined pattern onto the output grid using the fill color F. This drawing step overwrites any values previously placed in the output grid at the corresponding locations (including any P colors).
5. The final output grid contains the preserved P colors and the drawn F pattern, with all other cells remaining zero. Colors from the input grid that are neither P nor N nor F are effectively removed.
