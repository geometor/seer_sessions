The output grids contain 0, 1, and 2.\n3.  **Value '2' Persistence:** The positions of the value '2' remain unchanged from the input to the output.\n4.  **Value '0' Persistence/Change:** Some positions with value '0' in the input remain '0' in the output, while others change to '1'.\n5.  **Value '1' Origin:** The value '1' only appears in the output grid, specifically in positions that were '0' in the input grid.\n6.  **Spatial Relationship:** The appearance of '1's seems related to the positions of the '2's. Specifically, '1's appear *between* pairs of '2's, either horizontally in the same row or vertically in the same column, provided the space between them consists entirely of '0's in the input.\n7.  **Filling Mechanism:** The transformation acts like a \"fill\" operation. If two '2's exist on the same row or column with only '0's between them, those intermediate '0's are converted to '1's. This occurs independently for horizontal and vertical alignments.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
