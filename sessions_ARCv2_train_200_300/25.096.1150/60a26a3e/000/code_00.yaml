objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - elements: cells
  - name: cell
    properties:
      - position: (row, column)
      - value: integer (0, 1, or 2)
  - name: pair_of_twos
    properties:
      - cell_1: (r1, c1) with value 2
      - cell_2: (r2, c2) with value 2
      - alignment: horizontal (r1 == r2) or vertical (c1 == c2)
relationships:
  - type: horizontal_gap
    condition: exists between pair_of_twos (r, c1) and (r, c2) where c1 < c2, and all cells (r, c) for c1 < c < c2 have value 0 in the input.
  - type: vertical_gap
    condition: exists between pair_of_twos (r1, c) and (r2, c) where r1 < r2, and all cells (r, c) for r1 < r < r2 have value 0 in the input.
actions:
  - name: fill_gap_with_ones
    description: Change the value of cells within a horizontal or vertical gap from 0 to 1.
    target: cells within identified gaps
