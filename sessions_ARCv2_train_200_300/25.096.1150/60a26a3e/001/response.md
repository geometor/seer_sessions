def transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
    """
    Transforms the input grid by filling the gaps between pairs of '2's with '1's.

    The transformation operates in two passes: horizontal and vertical.
    1. Horizontal Pass: For each row, identifies pairs of cells containing '2'.
       If all cells between a pair contain '0' in the input grid, these cells
       are changed to '1' in the output grid.
    2. Vertical Pass: For each column, identifies pairs of cells containing '2'.
       If all cells between a pair contain '0' in the input grid, these cells
       are changed to '1' in the output grid.
    The final output grid contains the combined results of both passes.
