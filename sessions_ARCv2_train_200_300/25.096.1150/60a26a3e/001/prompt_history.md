## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) containing numerical values.
2.  **Grid Values:** The input grids contain only the values 0 and 2. The output grids contain 0, 1, and 2.
3.  **Value '2' Persistence:** The positions of the value '2' remain unchanged from the input to the output.
4.  **Value '0' Persistence/Change:** Some positions with value '0' in the input remain '0' in the output, while others change to '1'.
5.  **Value '1' Origin:** The value '1' only appears in the output grid, specifically in positions that were '0' in the input grid.
6.  **Spatial Relationship:** The appearance of '1's seems related to the positions of the '2's. Specifically, '1's appear *between* pairs of '2's, either horizontally in the same row or vertically in the same column, provided the space between them consists entirely of '0's in the input.
7.  **Filling Mechanism:** The transformation acts like a "fill" operation. If two '2's exist on the same row or column with only '0's between them, those intermediate '0's are converted to '1's. This occurs independently for horizontal and vertical alignments.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid:
    *   Identify all pairs of cells in that row that contain the value '2'.
    *   For each pair of '2's at `(r, c1)` and `(r, c2)` with `c1 < c2`, check if all cells between them (i.e., `(r, c)` for `c1 < c < c2`) contain the value '0'.
    *   If the condition is met, change the value of these intermediate cells in the output grid from '0' to '1'.
3.  Iterate through each column of the input grid:
    *   Identify all pairs of cells in that column that contain the value '2'.
    *   For each pair of '2's at `(r1, c)` and `(r2, c)` with `r1 < r2`, check if all cells between them (i.e., `(r, c)` for `r1 < r < r2`) contain the value '0'.
    *   If the condition is met, change the value of these intermediate cells in the output grid from '0' to '1'.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
