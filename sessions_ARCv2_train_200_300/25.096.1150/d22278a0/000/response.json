These act as \"seeds\" or \"sources\".\n4.  **Output Characteristics:** The output grids are significantly more filled than the inputs. The non-zero numbers from the input appear to have expanded or \"painted\" regions of the grid.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The painting seems related to proximity. Each cell in the output grid appears to take the color of the *nearest* source cell from the input grid, measured by Manhattan distance. However, there's an additional constraint: the painting process creates striped patterns. A cell `(r, c)` only gets painted by a source `(sr, sc)` if the column index `c` has the same parity (even or odd) as the source's column index `sc`.\n6.  **Tie-breaking:** If a cell is equidistant from two or more source cells, it remains zero (background color).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
