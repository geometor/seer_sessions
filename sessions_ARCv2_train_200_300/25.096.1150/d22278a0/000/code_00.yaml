Grid:
  Type: 2D Matrix
  Cell Values: Integers (0 for background, non-zero for colors)
  Dimensions: Consistent between input and output pair

Source Cells:
  Identification: Non-zero cells in the input grid.
  Properties:
    - row_index (integer)
    - column_index (integer)
    - value (color, integer > 0)
    - column_parity (even/odd based on column_index)
  Role: Initiate painting/filling process.

Target Cells:
  Identification: All cells in the output grid.
  Properties:
    - row_index (integer)
    - column_index (integer)
    - value (color, integer >= 0)

Action:
  Name: Paint Grid
  Rule: Assign color to target cells based on proximity to source cells and column parity matching.
  Proximity Metric: Manhattan Distance (|row1 - row2| + |col1 - col2|)

Relationships:
  - Each target cell's value is determined by the nearest unique source cell in the input.
  - Tie-breaking: If a target cell is equidistant to multiple source cells, its value remains 0.
  - Parity Constraint: A target cell (tr, tc) can only receive color from a source cell (sr, sc) if tc % 2 == sc % 2. If the closest unique source does not satisfy this parity constraint, the target cell's value remains 0.
