Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** Both are 2D grids (matrices) filled with integers.
2.  **Content:** The grids primarily contain zeros (background color) and a few non-zero integers (representing distinct colors or sources).
3.  **Input Characteristics:** The non-zero numbers in the input are sparse, typically located near the edges or corners. These act as "seeds" or "sources".
4.  **Output Characteristics:** The output grids are significantly more filled than the inputs. The non-zero numbers from the input appear to have expanded or "painted" regions of the grid.
5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The painting seems related to proximity. Each cell in the output grid appears to take the color of the *nearest* source cell from the input grid, measured by Manhattan distance. However, there's an additional constraint: the painting process creates striped patterns. A cell `(r, c)` only gets painted by a source `(sr, sc)` if the column index `c` has the same parity (even or odd) as the source's column index `sc`.
6.  **Tie-breaking:** If a cell is equidistant from two or more source cells, it remains zero (background color).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 2D Matrix
  Cell Values: Integers (0 for background, non-zero for colors)
  Dimensions: Consistent between input and output pair

Source Cells:
  Identification: Non-zero cells in the input grid.
  Properties:
    - row_index (integer)
    - column_index (integer)
    - value (color, integer > 0)
    - column_parity (even/odd based on column_index)
  Role: Initiate painting/filling process.

Target Cells:
  Identification: All cells in the output grid.
  Properties:
    - row_index (integer)
    - column_index (integer)
    - value (color, integer >= 0)

Action:
  Name: Paint Grid
  Rule: Assign color to target cells based on proximity to source cells and column parity matching.
  Proximity Metric: Manhattan Distance (|row1 - row2| + |col1 - col2|)

Relationships:
  - Each target cell's value is determined by the nearest unique source cell in the input.
  - Tie-breaking: If a target cell is equidistant to multiple source cells, its value remains 0.
  - Parity Constraint: A target cell (tr, tc) can only receive color from a source cell (sr, sc) if tc % 2 == sc % 2. If the closest unique source does not satisfy this parity constraint, the target cell's value remains 0.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros.
2.  Identify all source cells in the input grid: find coordinates `(sr, sc)` and value `sv` for all cells where `sv > 0`. Store these sources along with their column parity (`sc % 2`).
3.  Iterate through each target cell `(tr, tc)` in the grid dimensions.
4.  For the current target cell `(tr, tc)`:
    a.  Calculate the Manhattan distance from `(tr, tc)` to every source cell `(sr, sc)`.
    b.  Find the minimum distance calculated.
    c.  Identify all source cells that are at this minimum distance.
    d.  If there is exactly one unique source cell `(sr_closest, sc_closest)` with value `sv_closest` at the minimum distance:
        i.  Check if the target column parity `(tc % 2)` matches the source column parity `(sc_closest % 2)`.
        ii. If the parities match, set the value of the output grid cell `(tr, tc)` to `sv_closest`.
        iii. If the parities do *not* match, the output grid cell `(tr, tc)` remains 0.
    e.  If there is zero or more than one source cell at the minimum distance (a tie), the output grid cell `(tr, tc)` remains 0.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
