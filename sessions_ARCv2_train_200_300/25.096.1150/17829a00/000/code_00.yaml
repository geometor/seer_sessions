Task: Grid Transformation based on Neighborhood Influence

Elements:
  - InputGrid: A 2D array of integers.
  - OutputGrid: A 2D array of integers, same dimensions as InputGrid.
  - Cell: An individual element within a grid, having a row, column, and value.
  - BackgroundValue: The integer value that constitutes the majority of the grid and is subject to change (e.g., 7 in the examples).
  - ForegroundValues: Other integer values present in the grid that act as catalysts for change and remain constant themselves (e.g., 9, 8 in example 1; 2, 5 in example 2).
  - Neighborhood: The set of 8 cells immediately surrounding a given cell (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).

Properties:
  - GridDimensions: Rows and columns of the grids.
  - CellValue: The integer stored in a cell.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Cells can be adjacent to other cells within their neighborhood.
  - Influence: ForegroundValues in a cell's neighborhood can influence the transformation of a BackgroundValue cell.

Actions:
  - Identify: Determine the BackgroundValue and ForegroundValues from the InputGrid.
  - Analyze Neighborhood: For each BackgroundValue cell, examine the values of its neighbors in the InputGrid.
  - Filter Neighbors: Identify which neighbors contain ForegroundValues.
  - Determine Unique Foreground Neighbors: Find the set of distinct ForegroundValues present in the neighborhood.
  - Conditional Update:
    - If a BackgroundValue cell has exactly one unique type of ForegroundValue among its neighbors, update the corresponding cell in the OutputGrid to that ForegroundValue.
    - Otherwise, the corresponding cell in the OutputGrid retains the BackgroundValue.
  - Preserve: Cells containing ForegroundValues in the InputGrid remain unchanged in the OutputGrid.
