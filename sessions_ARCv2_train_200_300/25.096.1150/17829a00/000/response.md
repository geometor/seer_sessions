Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are grids of numbers (integers). The grids appear to be square (16x16 in the examples).
*   **Number Types:** Each grid contains multiple distinct numbers.
*   **Background vs. Foreground:** In both examples, the number '7' appears to be a dominant "background" value. Other numbers ('9' and '8' in example 1; '2' and '5' in example 2) act as "foreground" elements or seeds.
*   **Borders:** The top and bottom rows often consist entirely of specific foreground numbers and remain unchanged in the output.
*   **Transformation Focus:** The changes occur primarily to the background number ('7') based on its proximity to foreground numbers. Foreground numbers themselves do not change.
*   **Neighborhood Influence:** The transformation of a background cell seems dependent on the values of its immediate neighbours (including diagonals).
*   **Conditional Change:** A background cell ('7') only changes if its neighbouring foreground cells are all of the *same* type. If it's adjacent to multiple *different* foreground numbers, or no foreground numbers, it remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation based on Neighborhood Influence

Elements:
  - InputGrid: A 2D array of integers.
  - OutputGrid: A 2D array of integers, same dimensions as InputGrid.
  - Cell: An individual element within a grid, having a row, column, and value.
  - BackgroundValue: The integer value that constitutes the majority of the grid and is subject to change (e.g., 7 in the examples).
  - ForegroundValues: Other integer values present in the grid that act as catalysts for change and remain constant themselves (e.g., 9, 8 in example 1; 2, 5 in example 2).
  - Neighborhood: The set of 8 cells immediately surrounding a given cell (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).

Properties:
  - GridDimensions: Rows and columns of the grids.
  - CellValue: The integer stored in a cell.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Cells can be adjacent to other cells within their neighborhood.
  - Influence: ForegroundValues in a cell's neighborhood can influence the transformation of a BackgroundValue cell.

Actions:
  - Identify: Determine the BackgroundValue and ForegroundValues from the InputGrid.
  - Analyze Neighborhood: For each BackgroundValue cell, examine the values of its neighbors in the InputGrid.
  - Filter Neighbors: Identify which neighbors contain ForegroundValues.
  - Determine Unique Foreground Neighbors: Find the set of distinct ForegroundValues present in the neighborhood.
  - Conditional Update:
    - If a BackgroundValue cell has exactly one unique type of ForegroundValue among its neighbors, update the corresponding cell in the OutputGrid to that ForegroundValue.
    - Otherwise, the corresponding cell in the OutputGrid retains the BackgroundValue.
  - Preserve: Cells containing ForegroundValues in the InputGrid remain unchanged in the OutputGrid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Assume the background value is '7' and all other numbers are foreground values (based on the provided examples; a more general approach might identify the most frequent value as background).
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid.
4.  If the value of the input cell `input[r][c]` is the background value ('7'):
    a.  Get the values of all 8 neighbouring cells from the *input* grid (handling boundary conditions).
    b.  Create a set of the *distinct foreground values* found among these neighbours.
    c.  If the size of this set is exactly 1 (meaning all foreground neighbours are of the same single type):
        i.  Update the value of the output cell `output[r][c]` to be the single foreground value found in the set.
5.  Return the final output grid.
