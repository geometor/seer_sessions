The grids appear to be square (16x16 in the examples).\n*   **Number Types:** Each grid contains multiple distinct numbers.\n*   **Background vs. Foreground:** In both examples, the number '7' appears to be a dominant \"background\" value. Other numbers ('9' and '8' in example 1; '2' and '5' in example 2) act as \"foreground\" elements or seeds.\n*   **Borders:** The top and bottom rows often consist entirely of specific foreground numbers and remain unchanged in the output.\n*   **Transformation Focus:** The changes occur primarily to the background number ('7') based on its proximity to foreground numbers. Foreground numbers themselves do not change.\n*   **Neighborhood Influence:** The transformation of a background cell seems dependent on the values of its immediate neighbours (including diagonals).\n*   **Conditional Change:** A background cell ('7') only changes if its neighbouring foreground cells are all of the *same* type. If it's adjacent to multiple *different* foreground numbers, or no foreground numbers, it remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
