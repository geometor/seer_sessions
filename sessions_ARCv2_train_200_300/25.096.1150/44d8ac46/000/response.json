The grid dimensions also remain constant.\n5.  **Key Pattern:** The change from '0' to '2' occurs specifically within regions of '0's that are entirely enclosed or surrounded by cells with the value '5'. If a region of '0's touches the border of the grid or is not completely walled off by '5's, it remains unchanged. Example `train_3` shows a case where no '0' regions are fully enclosed, resulting in an output identical to the input.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
