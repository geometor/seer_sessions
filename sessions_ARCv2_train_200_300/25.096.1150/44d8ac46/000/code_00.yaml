Grid:
  Type: 2D Matrix
  Cell_Values: [0, 5, 2] # 0=background, 5=boundary, 2=fill
Input_Grid:
  Alias: input
  Contains: Cells with values 0 and 5
Output_Grid:
  Alias: output
  Derived_From: input
  Contains: Cells with values 0, 5, and 2
Objects:
  - Type: Region
    Description: A connected area of cells with the same value.
    Properties:
      - Value: The integer value of the cells in the region (e.g., 0 or 5).
      - Connectivity: Cells are considered connected if they share an edge (up, down, left, right).
      - Boundary_Connectivity: Whether a region touches the edge of the grid.
Relationship:
  - Type: Enclosure
    Subject: Region (Value=0)
    Object: Region (Value=5)
    Description: A region of '0' cells is enclosed if every path from a cell within that region to the grid boundary must pass through a cell with value '5'.
Action:
  - Type: Fill
    Target: Enclosed '0' Regions
    Condition: The '0' region must be fully enclosed by '5' cells (not connected to the grid boundary except through '5' cells).
    Result: Change the value of all cells within the target region from 0 to 2.
Rule:
  - If a region of '0' cells is fully enclosed by '5' cells, change all '0's in that region to '2's. Otherwise, leave the '0' cells unchanged. '5' cells are never changed.
