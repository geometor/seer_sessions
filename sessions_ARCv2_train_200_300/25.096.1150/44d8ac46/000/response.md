**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) of integers.
2.  **Grid Values:** The grids contain three distinct integer values: 0 (black), 5 (orange), and 2 (blue, only in output).
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing some '0' cells in the input grid to '2' cells in the output grid.
4.  **Static Elements:** The cells with value '5' remain unchanged between input and output. The grid dimensions also remain constant.
5.  **Key Pattern:** The change from '0' to '2' occurs specifically within regions of '0's that are entirely enclosed or surrounded by cells with the value '5'. If a region of '0's touches the border of the grid or is not completely walled off by '5's, it remains unchanged. Example `train_3` shows a case where no '0' regions are fully enclosed, resulting in an output identical to the input.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 2D Matrix
  Cell_Values: [0, 5, 2] # 0=background, 5=boundary, 2=fill
Input_Grid:
  Alias: input
  Contains: Cells with values 0 and 5
Output_Grid:
  Alias: output
  Derived_From: input
  Contains: Cells with values 0, 5, and 2
Objects:
  - Type: Region
    Description: A connected area of cells with the same value.
    Properties:
      - Value: The integer value of the cells in the region (e.g., 0 or 5).
      - Connectivity: Cells are considered connected if they share an edge (up, down, left, right).
      - Boundary_Connectivity: Whether a region touches the edge of the grid.
Relationship:
  - Type: Enclosure
    Subject: Region (Value=0)
    Object: Region (Value=5)
    Description: A region of '0' cells is enclosed if every path from a cell within that region to the grid boundary must pass through a cell with value '5'.
Action:
  - Type: Fill
    Target: Enclosed '0' Regions
    Condition: The '0' region must be fully enclosed by '5' cells (not connected to the grid boundary except through '5' cells).
    Result: Change the value of all cells within the target region from 0 to 2.
Rule:
  - If a region of '0' cells is fully enclosed by '5' cells, change all '0's in that region to '2's. Otherwise, leave the '0' cells unchanged. '5' cells are never changed.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct connected regions of cells with the value '0' in the input grid.
3.  For each identified region of '0' cells:
    a.  Determine if this region is "enclosed". A region is considered enclosed if none of its cells are on the grid boundary, AND all adjacent neighboring cells *outside* the region have the value '5'. (Alternatively, check if a flood fill starting from any cell in the '0' region can reach the grid boundary without crossing a '5').
    b.  If the region is determined to be enclosed:
        i.  Iterate through all cells belonging to this enclosed region.
        ii. For each cell in the enclosed region, change its value in the *output* grid from '0' to '2'.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
