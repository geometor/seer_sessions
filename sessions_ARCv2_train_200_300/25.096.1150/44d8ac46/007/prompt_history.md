**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) of integers.
2.  **Grid Values:** The grids contain three distinct integer values: 0 (black), 5 (orange), and 2 (blue, only in output).
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing some '0' cells in the input grid to '2' cells in the output grid.
4.  **Static Elements:** The cells with value '5' remain unchanged between input and output. The grid dimensions also remain constant.
5.  **Key Pattern:** The change from '0' to '2' occurs specifically within regions of '0's that are entirely enclosed or surrounded by cells with the value '5'. If a region of '0's touches the border of the grid or is not completely walled off by '5's, it remains unchanged. Example `train_3` shows a case where no '0' regions are fully enclosed, resulting in an output identical to the input.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 2D Matrix
  Cell_Values: [0, 5, 2] # 0=background, 5=boundary, 2=fill
Input_Grid:
  Alias: input
  Contains: Cells with values 0 and 5
Output_Grid:
  Alias: output
  Derived_From: input
  Contains: Cells with values 0, 5, and 2
Objects:
  - Type: Region
    Description: A connected area of cells with the same value.
    Properties:
      - Value: The integer value of the cells in the region (e.g., 0 or 5).
      - Connectivity: Cells are considered connected if they share an edge (up, down, left, right).
      - Boundary_Connectivity: Whether a region touches the edge of the grid.
Relationship:
  - Type: Enclosure
    Subject: Region (Value=0)
    Object: Region (Value=5)
    Description: A region of '0' cells is enclosed if every path from a cell within that region to the grid boundary must pass through a cell with value '5'.
Action:
  - Type: Fill
    Target: Enclosed '0' Regions
    Condition: The '0' region must be fully enclosed by '5' cells (not connected to the grid boundary except through '5' cells).
    Result: Change the value of all cells within the target region from 0 to 2.
Rule:
  - If a region of '0' cells is fully enclosed by '5' cells, change all '0's in that region to '2's. Otherwise, leave the '0' cells unchanged. '5' cells are never changed.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct connected regions of cells with the value '0' in the input grid.
3.  For each identified region of '0' cells:
    a.  Determine if this region is "enclosed". A region is considered enclosed if none of its cells are on the grid boundary, AND all adjacent neighboring cells *outside* the region have the value '5'. (Alternatively, check if a flood fill starting from any cell in the '0' region can reach the grid boundary without crossing a '5').
    b.  If the region is determined to be enclosed:
        i.  Iterate through all cells belonging to this enclosed region.
        ii. For each cell in the enclosed region, change its value in the *output* grid from '0' to '2'.
4.  Return the modified output grid.

Identifies connected regions of '0' cells within a 2D grid. 
If a region of '0's is not connected to the grid boundary (i.e., it's fully enclosed by '5's or other grid contents), 
all '0's within that specific region are changed to '2's. 
Cells with value '5' remain unchanged. '0' regions that touch the boundary remain '0'.

Transforms the input grid based on the following rule:
Find all connected regions of cells with the value 0.
For each such region, examine its complete perimeter, which includes all cells

part of the region itself.
If and only if every cell in this complete perimeter has the value 5, then change

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code attempted to solve the task by identifying regions of '0's and checking their 8-directional perimeter for the value '5'. The results show this approach is incorrect, leading to mismatches in examples 1, 3, and 4. The errors involve incorrectly filling some '0' regions with '2's (Examples 1, 3, 4) or failing to fill regions that should be filled (though this doesn't seem to be the primary issue here, the previous code overfilled).

The key insight from comparing the expected and transformed outputs is that the filling rule is not about the immediate perimeter but about whether a '0' region is "landlocked" or "enclosed" by '5's such that it has *no* path consisting solely of '0's leading to the grid boundary. Example 3 is crucial: although some '0' regions have perimeters consisting only of '5's and other '0's, they are *not* filled because those adjacent '0's eventually connect to the boundary '0's.

**Strategy:**

1.  Implement a boundary connection check. Identify all '0' cells connected (4-directionally) to the grid's outer boundary.
2.  Any '0' cell *not* connected to the boundary via a path of '0's is considered enclosed.
3.  Fill these enclosed '0' cells with '2'.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 2D Matrix
  Cell_Values: [0, 5, 2] # 0=background/potential fill, 5=boundary/wall, 2=filled area
Input_Grid:
  Alias: input
  Contains: Cells with values 0 and 5
Output_Grid:
  Alias: output
  Derived_From: input
  Contains: Cells with values 0, 5, and 2 (potentially)
Properties:
  Grid_Boundary: The set of cells forming the outermost rows and columns of the grid.
Objects:
  - Type: Cell
    Properties:
      - Value: Integer (0, 2, or 5)
      - Coordinates: (row, column)
      - Is_Boundary_Cell: Boolean (True if cell is in the first/last row or column)
  - Type: Region
    Definition: A set of connected cells sharing the same value.
    Properties:
      - Value: The integer value (e.g., 0 or 5).
      - Connectivity: 4-directional (up, down, left, right). Adjacent cells with the same value belong to the same region.
      - Touches_Grid_Boundary: Boolean (True if any cell in the region is a Grid_Boundary cell).
Relationship:
  - Type: Boundary_Connectivity (for '0' Regions)
    Definition: A region of '0' cells is considered boundary-connected if it is possible to reach a Grid_Boundary cell by starting from any cell within the region and moving only between adjacent '0' cells (4-directionally).
Action:
  - Type: Fill_Enclosed_Region
    Target: '0' Regions
    Condition: The '0' region must NOT be Boundary_Connected.
    Result: Change the value of all cells within the target region from 0 to 2 in the output grid.
Rule:
  - Identify all connected regions of '0' cells (using 4-directional connectivity).
  - For each '0' region, determine if it is Boundary_Connected.
  - If a '0' region is *not* Boundary_Connected, change all cells in that region to '2' in the output grid.
  - All other cells ('5' cells and '0' cells in Boundary_Connected regions) retain their original value in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Create a `visited` grid of the same dimensions, initialized to `False`, to keep track of '0' cells that have been determined to be connected to the boundary.
3.  Create a queue and add the coordinates `(r, c)` of all '0' cells located on the `input_grid`'s boundary (first row, last row, first column, last column) to the queue. Mark these cells as `True` in the `visited` grid.
4.  While the queue is not empty:
    a.  Dequeue a cell coordinate `(r, c)`.
    b.  Examine its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).
    c.  For each neighbor `(nr, nc)` that is within the grid bounds:
        i.  If the neighbor cell `input_grid[nr][nc]` has a value of '0' AND `visited[nr][nc]` is `False`:
            1.  Mark `visited[nr][nc]` as `True`.
            2.  Enqueue the neighbor coordinate `(nr, nc)`.
5.  Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` of the `input_grid`:
    a.  If `input_grid[r][c]` is '0' AND `visited[r][c]` is `False`:
        i.  Change the value of the corresponding cell in the `output_grid` to '2' (`output_grid[r][c] = 2`).
6.  Return the `output_grid`.
