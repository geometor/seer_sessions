"""
Transforms the input grid by identifying connected regions of '0' cells. 
If a region of '0's is not connected to the grid boundary (i.e., it's fully enclosed 
by '5's or other grid contents), all '0's within that specific region are changed to '2's. 
Connection to the boundary is determined by a path of adjacent (4-directionally) '0' cells 
leading to any cell on the grid's edge. Cells with value '5' act as barriers and remain 
unchanged. '0' regions that touch or can reach the boundary remain '0'.
