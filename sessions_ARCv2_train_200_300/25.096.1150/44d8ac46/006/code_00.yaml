Grid:
  Type: 2D Matrix
  Cell_Values: [0, 5, 2] # 0=background/potential fill, 5=boundary/wall, 2=filled area
Input_Grid:
  Alias: input
  Contains: Cells with values 0 and 5
Output_Grid:
  Alias: output
  Derived_From: input
  Contains: Cells with values 0, 5, and 2 (potentially)
Properties:
  Grid_Boundary: The set of cells forming the outermost rows and columns of the grid.
Objects:
  - Type: Cell
    Properties:
      - Value: Integer (0, 2, or 5)
      - Coordinates: (row, column)
      - Is_Boundary_Cell: Boolean (True if cell is in the first/last row or column)
  - Type: Region
    Definition: A set of connected cells sharing the same value.
    Properties:
      - Value: The integer value (e.g., 0 or 5).
      - Connectivity: 4-directional (up, down, left, right). Adjacent cells with the same value belong to the same region.
      - Touches_Grid_Boundary: Boolean (True if any cell in the region is a Grid_Boundary cell).
Relationship:
  - Type: Boundary_Connectivity (for '0' Regions)
    Definition: A region of '0' cells is considered boundary-connected if it is possible to reach a Grid_Boundary cell by starting from any cell within the region and moving only between adjacent '0' cells (4-directionally).
Action:
  - Type: Fill_Enclosed_Region
    Target: '0' Regions
    Condition: The '0' region must NOT be Boundary_Connected.
    Result: Change the value of all cells within the target region from 0 to 2 in the output grid.
Rule:
  - Identify all connected regions of '0' cells (using 4-directional connectivity).
  - For each '0' region, determine if it is Boundary_Connected.
  - If a '0' region is *not* Boundary_Connected, change all cells in that region to '2' in the output grid.
  - All other cells ('5' cells and '0' cells in Boundary_Connected regions) retain their original value in the output grid.
