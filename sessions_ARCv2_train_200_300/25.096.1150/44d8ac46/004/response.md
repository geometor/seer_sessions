**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code, based on the first example, correctly identified the core concept of filling enclosed regions of '0's. However, the results on subsequent examples reveal that the definition of "enclosed" used (simply not being connected to the boundary via other '0's) was too broad. Examples 1, 3, and 4 show regions that are technically enclosed according to that definition but are *not* filled in the expected output.

The key difference appears to be the nature of the boundary surrounding the '0' region. Comparing filled versus unfilled enclosed regions across all examples suggests a stricter condition:

*   **Observation:** Regions of '0's are filled with '2's *only if* the immediate perimeter around the region (including cells diagonal to the region's corners) consists entirely of '5's. If any cell in this complete perimeter is not a '5' (e.g., it's a '0' or touches the grid edge implicitly), the region remains unchanged.

**Strategy:**
1.  Refine the understanding of the task rule based on the "solid '5' perimeter" observation.
2.  Use code execution to verify this hypothesis by programmatically identifying '0' regions and checking their complete perimeters in each example.
3.  Update the YAML facts to reflect the importance of the perimeter's composition.
4.  Revise the Natural Language Program to accurately describe the refined transformation rule.

**Metrics Gathering**
We need to verify the "solid '5' perimeter" hypothesis. We will analyze each '0' region in the inputs: find the region, determine its perimeter cells (including diagonals), check if all perimeter cells are '5', and compare this with whether the region is filled ('2') in the output.
