            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the 3x3 grid structure defined by separator lines and the general concept of copying sections. However, the execution results for `code_00.py` reveal errors in identifying *which* source sections map to *which* destination sections.\n\n*   **Example 1 Failure:** The code incorrectly copied Input Section [1,0] (Middle-Left) to Output Section [1,2] (Middle-Right) and Input Section [2,1] (Bottom-Middle) to Output Section [2,2] (Bottom-Right). The expected output shows these destination sections ([1,2] and [2,2]) should retain their original content from the input grid.\n*   **Example 2 Failure:** Similar to Example 1, the code incorrectly copied Input Section [1,0] to Output Section [1,2] and Input Section [2,1] to Output Section [2,2]. Again, the expected output indicates these sections should remain unchanged from the input.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Re-evaluate the mapping between input sections and output sections based *only* on the changes observed between the input and expected output grids in both examples.\n2.  Refine the natural language program to accurately describe the specific copy operations required, omitting the incorrect ones identified above.\n3.  Update the YAML facts to reflect the refined understanding of objects and actions.\n4.  Focus the `transform` function (in the coder phase) solely on these validated copy operations, ensuring all other sections remain untouched relative to the input.\n\n**Metrics**\n"
