Objects:
  - Input_Grid: A 2D array of integers.
  - Output_Grid: A 2D array of integers, derived from Input_Grid.
  - Separator_Lines: Horizontal and vertical lines within the grid composed of a single non-zero integer (Separator_Color). Found by identifying full rows/columns with the same non-zero value.
  - Sections: Nine rectangular subgrids defined by the areas *between* the Separator_Lines, arranged in a 3x3 conceptual layout. Indexed by (row, column) from (0,0) to (2,2).
  - Source_Pattern_A: The content (subgrid) of the Input_Grid Section at index (1, 0) (Middle-Left).
  - Source_Pattern_B: The content (subgrid) of the Input_Grid Section at index (1, 1) (Middle-Middle).
  - Source_Pattern_C: The content (subgrid) of the Input_Grid Section at index (2, 1) (Bottom-Middle).

Properties:
  - Grid_Dimensions: Height and width of the grids.
  - Separator_Color: The integer value used for the Separator_Lines.
  - Section_Boundaries: The row and column ranges defining each Section, excluding the Separator_Lines themselves.

Relationships:
  - Sections are spatially separated by Separator_Lines.
  - Output_Grid structure (Separator_Lines, dimensions) is identical to Input_Grid initially.
  - Specific Output_Grid Sections are overwritten by specific Input_Grid Section contents (Source Patterns).

Actions:
  - Initialize_Output: Create Output_Grid as a copy of Input_Grid.
  - Identify_Separators: Find Separator_Color and the row/column indices of Separator_Lines.
  - Calculate_Section_Boundaries: Determine the coordinate ranges for each of the nine Sections based on Separator_Lines.
  - Extract_Section_Content: Get the subgrid data for a specific Section from the Input_Grid (Source_Pattern_A, Source_Pattern_B, Source_Pattern_C).
  - Overwrite_Section: Replace the content of a destination Section in the Output_Grid with the content of a specified Source Pattern.
