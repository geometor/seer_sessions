Okay, let's break down the task transformation.

### Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids of numbers (integers). The output grid is generally smaller than the input grid.
2.  **Input Structure:** The input grid contains distinct rectangular blocks of non-zero numbers, separated by rows and columns of zeros. Within each block, one number (e.g., '2' in train\_1, '1' in train\_2) forms a recognizable pattern, often resembling a seven-segment display digit. These digit-forming numbers act as the primary "drawing color" for the shape.
3.  **Markers:** Sometimes, within these digit patterns, other non-zero numbers appear, replacing one or more instances of the primary drawing color. These act as "markers".
4.  **Transformation Goal:** The transformation aims to identify each digit block in the input, determine a single representative "fill color" for that block based on its shape and any markers present, and construct a smaller output grid where each block is replaced by a solid rectangle of its corresponding fill color. The separators (originally zeros in the input) are also replaced by a specific color in the output.
5.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains the block structure of the input, but the internal patterns are gone, replaced by solid colors. The rows/columns that separated the blocks in the input become rows/columns of a specific separator color in the output.

### YAML Facts Documentation


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation based on Segmented Digit Recognition

Input:
  Type: 2D Grid (List of Lists of Integers)
  Properties:
    - Contains blocks of non-zero numbers separated by zero-padding.
    - Non-zero blocks often contain a dominant number ('drawing_color') forming a pattern ('digit_shape').
    - Some blocks may contain other non-zero numbers ('markers') replacing the 'drawing_color' at certain positions.
  Objects:
    - grid: The entire input data structure.
    - block: A rectangular subgrid containing a non-zero pattern, bounded by zeros.
    - drawing_color: The most frequent non-zero integer within a block (e.g., 2 in train_1, 1 in train_2).
    - digit_shape: The visual pattern formed by the 'drawing_color' within a block, interpretable as a digit (1-8).
    - marker: A non-zero integer within a block that is different from the 'drawing_color'.

Output:
  Type: 2D Grid (List of Lists of Integers)
  Properties:
    - Smaller dimensions than the input grid.
    - Retains the relative block structure.
    - Each block from the input is represented by a solid-colored rectangular subgrid ('fill_color').
    - Separator rows/columns between blocks are filled with a specific 'separator_color'.
  Objects:
    - grid: The entire output data structure.
    - subgrid: A rectangular area in the output corresponding to an input block.
    - fill_color: The single integer value used to fill an output subgrid.
    - separator_color: The integer value used to fill the rows/columns separating the subgrids.

Relationships & Actions:
  - Segmentation: Input grid is segmented into 'blocks' based on zero padding.
  - Identification: For each 'block':
      - Identify 'drawing_color'.
      - Identify visual 'digit_shape'.
      - Identify any 'marker'(s).
  - Color Determination:
      - Determine 'fill_color' for each block:
          - If one or more 'marker' exists AND the value of any 'marker' equals the 'digit_shape' value, 'fill_color' = 'digit_shape' value.
          - Otherwise (no markers OR no marker matches the shape value), 'fill_color' = 'digit_shape' value.
      - Determine 'separator_color': Seems to be the 'drawing_color' of the first (top-left) block in the input (e.g., 2 for train_1, 1 for train_2).
  - Construction: Build the output grid by:
      - Calculating the dimensions of output 'subgrids' (removing input zero padding).
      - Filling each 'subgrid' with its determined 'fill_color'.
      - Filling the separator rows/columns with the 'separator_color'.

```


### Natural Language Program

1.  **Segment Input:** Scan the input grid to identify the rectangular bounding boxes of non-zero patterns (blocks), using the surrounding rows/columns of zeros as delimiters. Note the dimensions and locations of these blocks and the zero-filled separators.
2.  **Analyze Each Block:** For each identified block:
    a.  **Determine Drawing Color:** Find the most frequent non-zero integer within the block's bounding box. This is the `drawing_color`.
    b.  **Identify Digit Shape:** Recognize the visual pattern formed by the `drawing_color`. Determine which digit (1 through 8, based on the visual representation like a seven-segment display) it corresponds to. This is the `digit_shape` value.
    c.  **Identify Markers:** Find all integers within the block's bounding box that are non-zero and *not* equal to the `drawing_color`. These are the `markers`. Collect their values.
    d.  **Determine Fill Color:**
        i.  Check if any `marker` value is numerically equal to the `digit_shape` value.
        ii. If a matching marker is found, the `fill_color` for this block is the `digit_shape` value.
        iii. If no markers exist, or if markers exist but none match the `digit_shape` value, the `fill_color` is also the `digit_shape` value. *(Simplified Rule: The fill color is always the digit shape value)*.
3.  **Determine Separator Color:** Identify the `drawing_color` of the first block processed (typically the top-left block). This color will be used as the `separator_color` in the output grid.
4.  **Construct Output Grid:**
    a.  Calculate the dimensions of the output grid based on the dimensions of the input blocks, excluding the zero separators.
    b.  Create a new grid of the calculated output dimensions.
    c.  Fill the areas in the new grid corresponding to the input block locations with their respective `fill_color` determined in step 2d.
    d.  Fill the rows and columns in the new grid corresponding to the zero separators in the input grid with the `separator_color` determined in step 3.
5.  **Return Output:** The newly constructed grid is the final output.
