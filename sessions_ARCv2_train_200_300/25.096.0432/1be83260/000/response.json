            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task transformation.\n\n### Perception of Task Elements\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids of numbers (integers). The output grid is generally smaller than the input grid.\n2.  **Input Structure:** The input grid contains distinct rectangular blocks of non-zero numbers, separated by rows and columns of zeros. Within each block, one number (e.g., '2' in train\\_1, '1' in train\\_2) forms a recognizable pattern, often resembling a seven-segment display digit. These digit-forming numbers act as the primary \"drawing color\" for the shape.\n3.  **Markers:** Sometimes, within these digit patterns, other non-zero numbers appear, replacing one or more instances of the primary drawing color. These act as \"markers\".\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The transformation aims to identify each digit block in the input, determine a single representative \"fill color\" for that block based on its shape and any markers present, and construct a smaller output grid where each block is replaced by a solid rectangle of its corresponding fill color. The separators (originally zeros in the input) are also replaced by a specific color in the output.\n5.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains the block structure of the input, but the internal patterns are gone, replaced by solid colors. The rows/columns that separated the blocks in the input become rows/columns of a specific separator color in the output.\n\n### YAML Facts Documentation\n\n"

Note the dimensions and locations of these blocks and the zero-filled separators.\n2.  **Analyze Each Block:** For each identified block:\n    a.  **Determine Drawing Color:** Find the most frequent non-zero integer within the block's bounding box. This is the `drawing_color`.\n    b.  **Identify Digit Shape:** Recognize the visual pattern formed by the `drawing_color`. Determine which digit (1 through 8, based on the visual representation like a seven-segment display) it corresponds to. This is the `digit_shape` value.\n    c.  **Identify Markers:** Find all integers within the block's bounding box that are non-zero and *not* equal to the `drawing_color`. These are the `markers`. Collect their values.\n    d.  **Determine Fill Color:**\n        i.  Check if any `marker` value is numerically equal to the `digit_shape` value.\n        ii. If a matching marker is found, the `fill_color` for this block is the `digit_shape` value.\n        iii. If no markers exist, or if markers exist but none match the `digit_shape` value, the `fill_color` is also the `digit_shape` value. *(Simplified Rule: The fill color is always the digit shape value)*.\n3.  **Determine Separator Color:** Identify the `drawing_color` of the first block processed (typically the top-left block). This color will be used as the `separator_color` in the output grid.\n4.  **Construct Output Grid:**\n    a.  Calculate the dimensions of the output grid based on the dimensions of the input blocks, excluding the zero separators.\n    b.  Create a new grid of the calculated output dimensions.\n    c.  Fill the areas in the new grid corresponding to the input block locations with their respective `fill_color` determined in step 2d.\n    d.  Fill the rows and columns in the new grid corresponding to the zero separators in the input grid with the `separator_color` determined in step 3.\n5.  **Return Output:** The newly constructed grid is the final output."
