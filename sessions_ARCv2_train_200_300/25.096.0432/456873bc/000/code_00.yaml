Objects:
  - Grid:
      Properties:
        - dimensions (rows, columns)
        - cells
  - Cell:
      Properties:
        - position (row, column)
        - color (0, 2, 3 in input; 0, 2, 8 in output)
  - Color 3 Block:
      Properties:
        - rectangular shape
        - contiguous
        - composed solely of color 3
        - location and dimensions
        - orientation (horizontal or vertical block spanning grid width/height)
      Relationships:
        - exists only in the input grid
        - replaced in the output grid
  - Source Pattern Block:
      Properties:
        - rectangular shape
        - same width/height as the Color 3 Block along the shared dimension
        - contains patterns primarily of color 2 and 0
      Relationships:
        - located adjacent (immediately below or left) to the Color 3 Block in the input grid (potentially separated by a single row/column of 0s)
        - its pattern is used to generate the output in the Color 3 Block's original area
  - Corner '2' Cells:
      Properties:
        - color is 2
      Relationships:
        - has exactly two neighboring cells (N, S, E, W) with color 2
        - these two neighbors are adjacent to each other (e.g., North and East neighbors are 2, others are not)

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the boundaries and orientation of the Color 3 Block.
  - Identify: Locate the Source Pattern Block based on adjacency (below for horizontal '3' block, left for vertical '3' block) and matching dimension.
  - Copy: Replicate the pattern (colors 0 and 2) from the Source Pattern Block onto the region originally occupied by the Color 3 Block in the output grid.
  - Modify: Iterate through all cells in the (intermediate) output grid.
  - Conditional Change: If a cell has color 2 and satisfies the Corner '2' condition (exactly two adjacent neighbors are also color 2), change its color to 8.
  - Preserve: All other cell colors (0s, and 2s not meeting the corner condition) remain unchanged.
