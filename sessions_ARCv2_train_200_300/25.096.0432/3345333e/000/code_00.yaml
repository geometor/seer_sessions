Task: Grid Filtering

Elements:
  - Type: Grid
    Properties:
      - 2-dimensional array of integers
      - Contains a background value (0)
      - Contains one or more non-zero integer values representing distinct objects/colors

Objects:
  - Type: Colored Region
    Properties:
      - Represented by a specific non-zero integer value
      - Composed of multiple cells within the grid
      - Has a frequency (count of cells with its value)

Relationships:
  - Input grid contains multiple Colored Regions.
  - Output grid is derived from the input grid.
  - One specific Colored Region from the input is removed (its cells are set to 0) in the output.
  - Other Colored Regions remain unchanged in the output.
  - The background (0) remains unchanged.

Action:
  - Identify all unique non-zero values (colors) present in the input grid.
  - Count the occurrences (frequency) of each unique non-zero value.
  - Determine the non-zero value with the minimum frequency.
  - Replace all cells containing the minimum frequency value with the background value (0).

Rule:
  - The transformation rule is to filter out the least frequent non-zero color/object from the grid, setting its corresponding cells to the background color (0).
