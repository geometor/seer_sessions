            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) of single digits. The grid size appears consistent (16x16 in these examples).\n2.  **Color Palette:** The grids use digits, primarily 0 (representing the background) and other non-zero digits representing distinct \"colors\" or object types.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves modifying the input grid by changing some non-zero digits to the background digit (0) while leaving others unchanged.\n4.  **Identifying Objects:** The non-zero digits seem to form distinct shapes or regions within the grid. In `train_1`, we see shapes made of '2's and '3's. In `train_2`, we see shapes made of '1's and '6's.\n5.  **Rule Deduction:** The key is to figure out *which* non-zero digit gets replaced by 0.\n    *   In `train_1`, '3' is replaced by '0', while '2' remains.\n    *   In `train_2`, '1' is replaced by '0', while '6' remains.\n    *   Comparing the counts of the non-zero digits:\n        *   `train_1`: Count('2') = 28, Count('3') = 12. '3' (minimum count) is removed.\n        *   `train_2`: Count('1') = 12, Count('6') = 26. '1' (minimum count) is removed.\n    *   The pattern appears to be: identify the non-zero digit that appears least frequently in the input grid and replace all instances of that digit with 0.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
