            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of the same dimensions (14x14 in the examples).\n2.  **Cell Values (Colors):** The grids contain integer values representing different colors: 0 (background), 5 (a solid block/area), and 1, 2, 3 (active 'trigger' colors).\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation modifies the grid based on the locations of the trigger colors (1, 2, or 3) relative to the block(s) of color 5. The trigger colors themselves are removed (effectively turned to 0) in the output unless they are transformed into 5s based on specific rules. The existing 5s generally remain unchanged.\n4.  **Two Transformation Patterns:**\n    *   **Expansion (Trigger Color 3):** As seen in `train_1`, cells with color 3 change to color 5 *if* they are orthogonally adjacent (sharing an edge) to a cell with color 5 in the input grid. If a cell with color 3 is not adjacent to any cell with color 5, it becomes 0.\n    *   **Projection (Trigger Colors 1 and 2):** As seen in `train_2` (color 2) and `train_3` (color 1), the trigger colors act as sources that project the color 5 onto specific target rows.\n        *   A contiguous horizontal block of color 5 exists.\n        *   Trigger cells located in rows *above* this block project color 5 vertically downwards onto the row immediately *above* the block, in the same column as the trigger cell.\n        *   Trigger cells located in rows *below* this block project color 5 vertically upwards onto the row immediately *below* the block, in the same column as the trigger cell.\n        *   The original trigger cells become 0 in the output.\n5.  **Rule Selection:** The specific transformation rule (Expansion or Projection) is determined by the trigger color present in the input (3 for Expansion, 1 or 2 for Projection). It's assumed only one type of trigger color (1, 2, or 3) will be present in a given input, besides 0 and 5.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
