elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - dimensions: variable (14x14 in examples)
      - cells: contains integer values representing colors
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - position: (row, column)
      - color: integer (0, 1, 2, 3, 5)
      - role: based on color
          - 0: background
          - 5: stable block/area
          - 1, 2, 3: trigger/source
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: cells
    definition: Orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right)
  - type: relative_position
    between: trigger cell (1, 2, 3) and the block of 5s
    definition: Above, below, or adjacent to the block.
actions:
  - name: identify_trigger_color
    input: input_grid
    output: color (1, 2, or 3) or None
  - name: identify_5_block_rows
    input: input_grid
    output: min_row, max_row (for horizontal block)
    condition: Trigger color is 1 or 2.
  - name: transform_cell_color
    based_on: rules dependent on trigger color and relationship to 5s.
    rules:
      - rule_name: expansion
        trigger_color: 3
        condition: Input cell color is 3.
        effect:
          - If cell is orthogonally adjacent to a 5, output cell color becomes 5.
          - Otherwise, output cell color becomes 0.
      - rule_name: projection
        trigger_color: 1 or 2
        condition: Input cell color is 1 or 2 at position (r, c).
        effect:
          - Initialize output grid by copying input and setting all trigger cells to 0.
          - If r < min_row_5, set output cell (min_row_5 - 1, c) to 5.
          - If r > max_row_5, set output cell (max_row_5 + 1, c) to 5.
      - rule_name: preserve_color
        condition: Input cell color is 0 or 5 and not modified by other rules.
        effect: Output cell color is the same as input cell color.
