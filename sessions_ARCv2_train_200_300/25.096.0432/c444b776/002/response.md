**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code (`code_00.py`) correctly identified the core concept of axes (lines of 4s) and the resulting transformation types (region swap for one axis, quadrant swap for two axes). However, the implementation failed to produce the correct output for both training examples, indicated by `Match: False` and significant `Pixels Off`.

Examining the `Transformed Output` vs `Expected Output`:
*   **Train 1 (Horizontal Axis):** The code correctly copied the lower part of the input to the upper part of the output but failed to copy the upper part of the input to the lower part of the output (leaving zeros).
*   **Train 2 (Two Axes):** The code correctly copied the Bottom-Left input quadrant to the Top-Right output quadrant and the Top-Right input quadrant to the Bottom-Left output quadrant (though the latter was all zeros in both input and expected output, making correctness trivial). However, it failed to copy the Top-Left input quadrant to the Bottom-Right output quadrant and the Bottom-Right input quadrant to the Top-Left output quadrant (leaving zeros in those output areas).

The errors seem systematic, specifically involving failures when copying *into* certain destination slices (e.g., `output[:h, ...]` or `output[h+1:, v+1:]`). While the provided Python code's slicing and assignment logic *appears* standard for numpy, it demonstrably failed in execution.

**Strategy:**
1.  Verify the grid dimensions and axis locations using code execution.
2.  Assume the transformation rule observed visually (swapping regions/quadrants across the '4' axes) is correct, as it matches the `Expected Output`.
3.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to clearly describe this intended swap transformation.
4.  The coder phase will need to focus on debugging the numpy implementation to ensure all slices are copied correctly, potentially by breaking down the copying step-by-step or using different temporary arrays if needed, ensuring that assignments to slices like `[:h, ...]` and `[h+1:, v+1:]` work as intended. The issue might lie in using `np.zeros_like` and only partially filling it, rather than starting with a copy or ensuring full coverage.

Example 1 Metrics: {'rows': 19, 'cols': 9, 'h_axis_index': 9, 'v_axis_index': None}
Example 2 Metrics: {'rows': 19, 'cols': 19, 'h_axis_index': 9, 'v_axis_index': 9}
Ex1 Upper Region Rows: 9, Lower Region Rows: 9
Ex2 TL Shape: (9, 9), TR Shape: (9, 9)
Ex2 BL Shape: (9, 9), BR Shape: (9, 9)

```
**Findings from Metrics:**
*   Example 1: 19x9 grid, horizontal axis at index 9. Upper region (rows 0-8) has 9 rows. Lower region (rows 10-18) has 9 rows. The regions are symmetrical in size.
*   Example 2: 19x19 grid, horizontal axis at index 9, vertical axis at index 9. All four quadrants defined by these axes are 9x9. The quadrants are symmetrical in size.

The symmetry confirms that the shape mismatch hypothesis for the code failure is unlikely *for these specific examples*. The failure is more likely rooted in the implementation details of the copy operations or the initialization strategy within the `transform` function.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Identify the dimensions (number of rows `R` and columns `C`) of the input grid.
3.  Search for a horizontal axis: a row index `h` such that all elements in `input_grid[h]` are 4. Store `h` if found.
4.  Search for a vertical axis: a column index `v` such that all elements in `input_grid[:, v]` are 4. Store `v` if found.
5.  Create an output grid of dimensions `R` x `C`, initialized (e.g., with zeros or as a copy of the input).
6.  **Case 1: Both horizontal axis `h` and vertical axis `v` are found:**
    a.  Copy the horizontal axis `input_grid[h, :]` to `output_grid[h, :]`.
    b.  Copy the vertical axis `input_grid[:, v]` to `output_grid[:, v]`.
    c.  Copy the input Top-Left quadrant (`input_grid[:h, :v]`) to the output Bottom-Right quadrant (`output_grid[h+1:, v+1:]`), ensuring the destination slice matches the source dimensions.
    d.  Copy the input Top-Right quadrant (`input_grid[:h, v+1:]`) to the output Bottom-Left quadrant (`output_grid[h+1:, :v]`), ensuring the destination slice matches the source dimensions.
    e.  Copy the input Bottom-Left quadrant (`input_grid[h+1:, :v]`) to the output Top-Right quadrant (`output_grid[:h, v+1:]`), ensuring the destination slice matches the source dimensions.
    f.  Copy the input Bottom-Right quadrant (`input_grid[h+1:, v+1:]`) to the output Top-Left quadrant (`output_grid[:h, :v]`), ensuring the destination slice matches the source dimensions.
7.  **Case 2: Only horizontal axis `h` is found:**
    a.  Copy the horizontal axis `input_grid[h, :]` to `output_grid[h, :]`.
    b.  Copy the input upper region (`input_grid[:h, :]`) to the output lower region (`output_grid[h+1:, :]`), ensuring the destination slice matches the source dimensions.
    c.  Copy the input lower region (`input_grid[h+1:, :]`) to the output upper region (`output_grid[:h, :]`), ensuring the destination slice matches the source dimensions.
    d.  (Ensure columns not part of the copied regions/axis retain their original values if the output started as a copy, or are filled appropriately if started empty).
8.  **Case 3: Only vertical axis `v` is found:**
    a.  Copy the vertical axis `input_grid[:, v]` to `output_grid[:, v]`.
    b.  Copy the input left region (`input_grid[:, :v]`) to the output right region (`output_grid[:, v+1:]`), ensuring the destination slice matches the source dimensions.
    c.  Copy the input right region (`input_grid[:, v+1:]`) to the output left region (`output_grid[:, :v]`), ensuring the destination slice matches the source dimensions.
    d.  (Ensure rows not part of the copied regions/axis retain their original values if the output started as a copy, or are filled appropriately if started empty).
9.  **Case 4: No axes are found:** The output grid should be identical to the input grid. (This is handled if the output grid started as a copy and no modifications were made).
10. Return the final output grid.
