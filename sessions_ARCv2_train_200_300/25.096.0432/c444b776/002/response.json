            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code (`code_00.py`) correctly identified the core concept of axes (lines of 4s) and the resulting transformation types (region swap for one axis, quadrant swap for two axes). However, the implementation failed to produce the correct output for both training examples, indicated by `Match: False` and significant `Pixels Off`.\n\nExamining the `Transformed Output` vs `Expected Output`:\n*   **Train 1 (Horizontal Axis):** The code correctly copied the lower part of the input to the upper part of the output but failed to copy the upper part of the input to the lower part of the output (leaving zeros).\n*   **Train 2 (Two Axes):** The code correctly copied the Bottom-Left input quadrant to the Top-Right output quadrant and the Top-Right input quadrant to the Bottom-Left output quadrant (though the latter was all zeros in both input and expected output, making correctness trivial). However, it failed to copy the Top-Left input quadrant to the Bottom-Right output quadrant and the Bottom-Right input quadrant to the Top-Left output quadrant (leaving zeros in those output areas).\n\nThe errors seem systematic, specifically involving failures when copying *into* certain destination slices (e.g., `output[:h, ...]` or `output[h+1:, v+1:]`). While the provided Python code's slicing and assignment logic *appears* standard for numpy, it demonstrably failed in execution.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Verify the grid dimensions and axis locations using code execution.\n2.  Assume the transformation rule observed visually (swapping regions/quadrants across the '4' axes) is correct, as it matches the `Expected Output`.\n3.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to clearly describe this intended swap transformation.\n4.  The coder phase will need to focus on debugging the numpy implementation to ensure all slices are copied correctly, potentially by breaking down the copying step-by-step or using different temporary arrays if needed, ensuring that assignments to slices like `[:h, ...]` and `[h+1:, v+1:]` work as intended. The issue might lie in using `np.zeros_like` and only partially filling it, rather than starting with a copy or ensuring full coverage.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
