            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) of integers.\n2.  **Grid Contents:** The grids primarily contain the number 0, representing a background. Non-zero numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8) are sparsely distributed.\n3.  **Key Feature - Axis:** A distinct feature is the presence of lines (rows or columns) composed entirely of the number 4. These lines act as axes or separators.\n    *   In `train_1`, there is a horizontal line of 4s.\n    *   In `train_2`, there is both a horizontal line and a vertical line of 4s.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation seems to involve rearranging sections of the grid relative to these axes of 4s.\n    *   In `train_1` (horizontal axis only): The content *above* the axis in the input appears *below* the axis in the output, and the content *below* the axis in the input appears *above* the axis in the output. The axis itself remains unchanged. This is effectively a swap of the regions across the horizontal axis.\n    *   In `train_2` (horizontal and vertical axes): The grid is divided into four quadrants by the axes. The transformation swaps diagonally opposite quadrants. The Top-Left quadrant swaps with the Bottom-Right, and the Top-Right quadrant swaps with the Bottom-Left. The axes themselves remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
