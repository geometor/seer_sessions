task_elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing the input and output state.
    properties:
      - dimensions: [rows, columns]
      - values: integers, with 0 as background and other integers (like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8) as foreground elements.
  - element: axis
    description: A line (row or column) within the grid composed entirely of the integer 4. Acts as a reference for transformation.
    properties:
      - type: 'horizontal' or 'vertical'
      - index: The row or column index of the axis.
      - identifier_value: 4
    relationships:
      - divides: the grid into regions (e.g., upper/lower, left/right) or quadrants.
  - element: region
    description: A contiguous section of the grid defined relative to an axis.
    properties:
      - location: 'upper', 'lower', 'left', 'right' relative to the axis.
    relationships:
      - defined_by: axis
  - element: quadrant
    description: A section of the grid defined by the intersection of a horizontal and a vertical axis.
    properties:
      - location: 'top_left', 'top_right', 'bottom_left', 'bottom_right' relative to the intersection point.
    relationships:
      - defined_by: horizontal_axis, vertical_axis
actions:
  - action: identify_axes
    description: Scan the input grid to find rows and columns composed entirely of the number 4.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: horizontal_axis_index (if found), vertical_axis_index (if found)
  - action: swap_regions
    description: Exchange the positions of regions across a single axis.
    condition: Only one axis (horizontal or vertical) is present.
    inputs: input_grid, axis_index, axis_type
    outputs: modified_grid
  - action: swap_quadrants
    description: Exchange the positions of diagonally opposite quadrants defined by two axes.
    condition: Both horizontal and vertical axes are present.
    inputs: input_grid, horizontal_axis_index, vertical_axis_index
    outputs: modified_grid
  - action: copy_axis
    description: Ensure the axis line(s) remain unchanged in the output grid.
    inputs: input_grid, axis_index(es)
    outputs: axis line(s) in the output_grid
