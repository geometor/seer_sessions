Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both 2D grids (matrices) of integers.
2.  **Cell Values:** The grids contain primarily three distinct integer values: 0, 2, and 5. '0' appears to represent the background or empty space.
3.  **Patterns:** The non-zero values form distinct patterns or shapes within the grid.
    *   **'2' Pattern:** The cells with value '2' seem to form a stable frame, boundary, or structure. This structure remains unchanged between the input and output grids in all examples.
    *   **'5' Pattern:** The cells with value '5' form a pattern that *is* changed between the input and output. In the input, the '5' pattern is always located *inside* the area demarcated by the '2' structure. In the output, the '5' pattern is located *outside* the '2' structure, and the original '5's inside are gone (replaced by '0').
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the '5' pattern. It appears to be moved from the inside to the outside of the '2' structure. The movement resembles a reflection across the boundary lines formed by the '2' pattern.
    *   In `train_1` and `train_3`, the '2' structure has prominent vertical segments. The '5' pattern seems to be reflected horizontally across these vertical boundary lines.
    *   In `train_2`, the '2' structure has prominent horizontal segments (top and bottom of a rectangle). The '5' pattern seems to be reflected vertically across these horizontal boundary lines.
    *   The rule seems to be: reflect each '5' cell across the *nearest* segment of the '2' boundary. If the nearest segment is vertical, reflect horizontally. If the nearest segment is horizontal, reflect vertically.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all cells in the input grid containing the value '2'. These form the static boundary structure.
3.  Identify all cells in the input grid containing the value '5'. These constitute the pattern to be transformed.
4.  For each cell `(r, c)` containing the value '5':
    a.  Find the closest cell `(r_b, c_b)` or segment of cells containing the value '2' (the boundary). Calculate distances (e.g., Manhattan or Euclidean) to all '2' cells and find the minimum distance. Note the closest boundary cell(s).
    b.  Determine the primary orientation of the boundary segment nearest to `(r, c)`. If the closest '2' cell `(r_b, c_b)` has `r == r_b` (or the closest segment is vertical), the reflection axis is vertical at column `c_b`. If the closest '2' cell has `c == c_b` (or the closest segment is horizontal), the reflection axis is horizontal at row `r_b`.
    c.  Calculate the reflected coordinates `(new_r, new_c)`:
        i.  If reflecting across a vertical axis at `c_b`: `new_r = r`, `new_c = c_b + (c_b - c) = 2 * c_b - c`.
        ii. If reflecting across a horizontal axis at `r_b`: `new_r = r_b + (r_b - r) = 2 * r_b - r`, `new_c = c`.
    d.  In the output grid, set the value of the original cell `(r, c)` to '0'.
    e.  In the output grid, set the value of the calculated cell `(new_r, new_c)` to '5'.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
