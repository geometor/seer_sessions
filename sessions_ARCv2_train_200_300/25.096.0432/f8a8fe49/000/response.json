            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both 2D grids (matrices) of integers.\n2.  **Cell Values:** The grids contain primarily three distinct integer values: 0, 2, and 5. '0' appears to represent the background or empty space.\n3.  **Patterns:** The non-zero values form distinct patterns or shapes within the grid.\n    *   **'2' Pattern:** The cells with value '2' seem to form a stable frame, boundary, or structure. This structure remains unchanged between the input and output grids in all examples.\n    *   **'5' Pattern:** The cells with value '5' form a pattern that *is* changed between the input and output. In the input, the '5' pattern is always located *inside* the area demarcated by the '2' structure. In the output, the '5' pattern is located *outside* the '2' structure, and the original '5's inside are gone (replaced by '0').\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the '5' pattern. It appears to be moved from the inside to the outside of the '2' structure. The movement resembles a reflection across the boundary lines formed by the '2' pattern.\n    *   In `train_1` and `train_3`, the '2' structure has prominent vertical segments. The '5' pattern seems to be reflected horizontally across these vertical boundary lines.\n    *   In `train_2`, the '2' structure has prominent horizontal segments (top and bottom of a rectangle). The '5' pattern seems to be reflected vertically across these horizontal boundary lines.\n    *   The rule seems to be: reflect each '5' cell across the *nearest* segment of the '2' boundary. If the nearest segment is vertical, reflect horizontally. If the nearest segment is horizontal, reflect vertically.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
