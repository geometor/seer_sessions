task_elements:
  - object: Grid
    description: A 2D matrix representing the input and output space.
  - object: Cell
    properties:
      - value: Integer (0, 2, or 5)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
      - type:
          - Background (value 0)
          - Boundary (value 2)
          - Movable Object (value 5)
  - object: Boundary Pattern
    description: A structure formed by connected cells with value 2.
    properties:
      - stability: Unchanged between input and output.
      - function: Acts as a mirror or reflection axis/frame.
      - segments: Can be composed of horizontal and vertical lines/segments.
  - object: Movable Pattern
    description: A shape or collection of cells with value 5.
    properties:
      - initial_location: Inside the Boundary Pattern in the input grid.
      - final_location: Outside the Boundary Pattern in the output grid.
      - relationship_to_boundary: Is reflected across the nearest segment of the Boundary Pattern.
  - action: Reflection
    description: The transformation applied to the Movable Pattern (5s).
    properties:
      - axis: Determined by the nearest segment of the Boundary Pattern (2s).
      - direction: Horizontal reflection across vertical boundary segments, Vertical reflection across horizontal boundary segments.
      - effect: Moves each '5' cell from its original position inside the boundary to a new position outside the boundary.
  - action: Removal
    description: Original '5' cells inside the boundary are removed.
    properties:
      - effect: The value of the original '5' cells is set to 0 in the output grid.
relationships:
  - type: Containment
    subject: Boundary Pattern (2s)
    object: Movable Pattern (5s)
    state: In the input grid, the 5s are contained within the 2s.
  - type: Proximity
    subject: Movable Pattern Cell (5)
    object: Boundary Pattern Segment (2s)
    description: Determines the specific axis of reflection for each '5' cell based on the closest boundary segment.
