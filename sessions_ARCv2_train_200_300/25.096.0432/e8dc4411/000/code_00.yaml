task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  cell_content: integers
  background_color: 
    description: The most frequent color in the input grid, excluding 0 perhaps. Specific value varies per example (1, 8, 4).
    role: Acts as the medium/target for propagation.
objects:
  - object_type: source_cell
    identifier: color_value
    properties:
      - color: 2
        action: propagates diagonally down-right
      - color: 3
        action: propagates diagonally down-left
      - color: 8
        action: propagates diagonally up-left AND up-right
    role: Initiates the propagation/painting process.
  - object_type: background_cell
    identifier: color_value (matches grid's background_color)
    role: Can be overwritten by propagation from a source_cell.
  - object_type: inert_cell
    identifier: color_value (e.g., 0)
    role: Not directly involved in propagation; remains unchanged and does not get overwritten.
actions:
  - action_type: propagate_and_paint
    actor: source_cell
    target: background_cell
    constraints:
      - stops_at_grid_boundary
      - follows_specific_diagonal_path (determined by source_cell color)
      - overwrites_only_background_cells_in_path
    result: Target cells change color to match the source cell's color.
relationship:
  - The output grid is a modified version of the input grid.
  - The modification rule depends on the specific color value of identified source cells.
  - Propagation paths extend from each source cell until the grid boundary.
  - Cells retain their input value unless overwritten by a propagation path (and only if they originally contained the background color).
