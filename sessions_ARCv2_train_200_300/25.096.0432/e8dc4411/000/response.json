The transformation appears to depend on the presence of specific numbers (2, 3, 8) within the grid, which act as \"sources\". These source numbers \"propagate\" or \"paint\" diagonally across the grid, changing cells that match the grid's \"background\" color. The background color is the predominant color in the input grid (1 in train_1, 8 in train_2, 4 in train_3). Other numbers (like 0) seem unaffected and might act as obstacles or simply remain unchanged. The original source numbers also remain in their initial positions. The direction of propagation depends on the source number.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
