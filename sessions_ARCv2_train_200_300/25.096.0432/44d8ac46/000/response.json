These shapes remain identical between the input and output.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the selective conversion of some `0`s to `2`s.\n5.  **Location of Change:** The `0`s that change to `2`s are always located *inside* regions enclosed by `5`s.\n6.  **Condition for Change:** Not all `0`s enclosed by `5`s are changed. Comparing the examples:\n    *   In `train_1`, `train_2`, and `train_4`, some enclosed `0` regions are filled with `2`s.\n    *   In `train_3`, no `0`s are changed, even though there are enclosed regions.\n    *   The unfilled regions in `train_1` (bottom) and `train_3` (both) seem to have boundaries made of thicker lines of `5`s compared to the filled regions. Specifically, the `5`s forming the boundary of unfilled holes often only have other `5`s or internal `0`s as neighbors, lacking adjacent external `0`s. Filled holes appear to have \"thin\" boundaries where each boundary `5` is adjacent to an external `0`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

If *any* boundary `5` cell exists such that *all* of its neighbors are either other `5`s or `0`s belonging *only* to the current hole being examined (i.e., it has no adjacent `0`s that are part of the background or a different hole), then this current hole should *not* be filled. Mark this hole as \"do not fill\" and stop checking its boundary `5`s.\n    e.  If the check completes for all boundary `5`s of the hole and the hole was never marked \"do not fill\", then proceed to fill it.\n    f.
