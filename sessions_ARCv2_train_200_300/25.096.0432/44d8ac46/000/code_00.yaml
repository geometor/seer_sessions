Objects:
  - Grid: A 2D array of cells.
  - Cell: An element in the grid with a specific integer value (color).
  - Region: A contiguous area of cells with the same color (e.g., a region of 0s).
  - Shape: A structure formed by connected cells of color 5.
  - Hole: A region of 0s completely surrounded by 5s (not connected to the grid boundary).

Properties:
  - Cell Color: 0 (background), 5 (shape/boundary), 2 (filled hole).
  - Region Connectivity: Cells within a region are adjacent (4-way or 8-way, appears 4-way matters for boundaries).
  - Hole Boundary: The set of 5-valued cells immediately adjacent to a hole.
  - Boundary Thickness (Inferred Property): Whether boundary 5s are adjacent to external 0s.

Actions:
  - Identify Regions: Find connected components of cells with the same color.
  - Identify Holes: Find 0-regions not reachable by flood fill from the grid boundary.
  - Analyze Hole Boundary: For each 5-cell on a hole's boundary, check its neighbors.
  - Fill Hole: Change the color of all 0s within a specific hole region to 2.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Cells can be neighbors (up, down, left, right).
  - Containment: Shapes (5s) enclose holes (0s that become 2s).
  - Boundary Condition: The decision to fill a hole (0 -> 2) depends on the neighborhood properties of the 5s forming its boundary.
