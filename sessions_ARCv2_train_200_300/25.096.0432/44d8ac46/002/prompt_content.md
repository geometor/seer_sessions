"""
Identifies enclosed regions of 0s (holes) within shapes formed by 5s in a 2D grid. 
A hole is filled with 2s if and only if every 5-cell forming its immediate boundary 
is adjacent to at least one 0-cell that is *not* part of that hole (i.e., an external 0 or a 0 from a different hole). 
If any boundary 5-cell of a hole is only adjacent to other 5s or 0s belonging exclusively 
to that specific hole, the hole remains unfilled (keeps its 0s).
