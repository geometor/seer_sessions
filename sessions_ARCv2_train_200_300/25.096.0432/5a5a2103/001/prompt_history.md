Okay, let's break down the perception, facts, and the natural language program for this task.

### Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of numbers (colors). A specific color acts as a divider, forming full horizontal and vertical lines that partition the grid into smaller, equally sized square regions. In `train_1`, the divider is `8`, creating 3x3 regions of 4x4 cells each (excluding the dividers). In `train_2`, the divider is `3`, creating 4x4 regions of 4x4 cells each.
2.  **Region Identification:** The dividing lines effectively create a grid of regions.
3.  **Pattern Colors:** Within some regions of the input grid, there are distinct non-zero, non-divider colors arranged in simple patterns (often 2x2 blocks, but not always). These appear to be the 'source' patterns.
4.  **Output Pattern:** The output grid largely preserves the dividing lines. However, the content *within* the regions is significantly transformed.
5.  **Row-Based Color Propagation:** The key observation is that the non-zero, non-divider color found in the *leftmost* region of a given *row of regions* in the input determines the single color used to fill *all* regions in that same row of regions in the output.
6.  **Fixed Base Pattern:** There is a specific, fixed spatial pattern used to fill the output regions. This pattern uses only the propagated color (from step 5) and the background color (`0`). Crucially, this base pattern seems *constant* for a given task instance (i.e., the same pattern shape is used for color `1`, `2`, and `3` in `train_1`, and a *different* fixed pattern shape is used for `1`, `2`, `4`, `8` in `train_2`). This base pattern shape appears to be derived from the output generated for the top-left region.

### Facts


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - cells: containing integer values (colors)
      - dimensions: H x W
      - divider_color: an integer color value forming full dividing lines
      - dividing_lines: horizontal and vertical lines composed of the divider_color
      - regions: square subgrids defined by the dividing_lines
      - region_size: N x N dimension of the regions
      - pattern_cells: cells within input regions containing non-zero, non-divider colors
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - cells: containing integer values (colors)
      - dimensions: H x W (same as input)
      - divider_color: same as input
      - dividing_lines: preserved from input
      - regions: same partitioning as input
      - region_fill_color: the single non-zero color used within an output region
      - base_pattern: a fixed N x N template used to fill output regions, consisting of 0s and a placeholder for the region_fill_color

relationships:
  - type: partitioning
    subject: dividing_lines
    object: input_grid
    details: Dividing lines partition the input_grid into regions.
  - type: preservation
    subject: dividing_lines
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    details: Dividing lines are copied directly from input to output.
  - type: determination (fill color)
    subject: pattern_cells in the leftmost region of a row of regions (input_grid)
    object: region_fill_color for all regions in that same row (output_grid)
    details: The first non-zero, non-divider color found in the input's leftmost region dictates the fill color for the entire corresponding row of regions in the output.
  - type: determination (base pattern shape)
    subject: output pattern of the top-left region (output_grid, rows 0..N-1, cols 0..N-1)
    object: base_pattern used for all non-divider regions
    details: The specific spatial arrangement of 0s and the fill color in the top-left output region defines the template (base_pattern) used everywhere else.
  - type: application (filling)
    subject: base_pattern
    object: non-divider regions in output_grid
    details: Each non-divider region in the output is filled by applying the base_pattern, substituting the placeholder with the determined region_fill_color for its row.

actions:
  - name: identify_dividers
    actor: system
    input: input_grid
    output: divider_color, dividing_lines, region_size (N)
  - name: determine_base_pattern
    actor: system
    input: output_grid (specifically the top-left N x N region)
    output: base_pattern template
  - name: determine_row_fill_colors
    actor: system
    input: input_grid, divider_color, region_size (N)
    output: mapping from row_of_regions_index to fill_color
  - name: construct_output

    input: input_grid, dividing_lines, base_pattern, row_fill_colors mapping
    output: output_grid
```


### Natural Language Program

1.  **Analyze Input Structure:** Identify the `divider_color` that forms complete horizontal and vertical lines in the `input_grid`. Note the rows and columns containing these `dividing_lines`. These lines partition the grid into smaller, square `regions` of size `N x N`.
2.  **Determine Base Pattern:** Observe the pattern present in the top-left `N x N` region (rows 0 to N-1, cols 0 to N-1) of the corresponding `output_grid` provided in the example. Define this as the `base_pattern`, representing the non-zero color as a placeholder 'C'.
3.  **Determine Fill Colors:** For each horizontal row of regions in the `input_grid` (e.g., rows 0 to N-1, rows N+1 to 2N, etc.):
    a.  Examine the *leftmost* region in that row (cols 0 to N-1).
    b.  Find the first color value within this region that is *not* 0 and *not* the `divider_color`.
    c.  Record this color as the `fill_color` associated with this entire row of regions.
4.  **Construct Output Grid:**
    a.  Create a new grid, initially a copy of the `input_grid`.
    b.  Iterate through all the `regions` defined by the `dividing_lines`.
    c.  If a region is *not* part of a `dividing_line` row or column:
        i.  Identify which row of regions it belongs to.
        ii. Retrieve the `fill_color` determined for that row in Step 3.
        iii. Apply the `base_pattern` (from Step 2) to this region in the output grid, replacing the placeholder 'C' with the retrieved `fill_color`.
    d.  Regions that are part of the `dividing_lines` remain unchanged from the initial copy of the input.
5.  Return the constructed `output_grid`.
