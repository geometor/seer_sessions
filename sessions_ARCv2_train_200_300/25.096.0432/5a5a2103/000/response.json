            "text": "Okay, let's break down the perception, facts, and the natural language program for this task.\n\n### Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of numbers (colors). A specific color acts as a divider, forming full horizontal and vertical lines that partition the grid into smaller, equally sized square regions. In `train_1`, the divider is `8`, creating 3x3 regions of 4x4 cells each (excluding the dividers). In `train_2`, the divider is `3`, creating 4x4 regions of 4x4 cells each.\n2.  **Region Identification:** The dividing lines effectively create a grid of regions.\n3.  **Pattern Colors:** Within some regions of the input grid, there are distinct non-zero, non-divider colors arranged in simple patterns (often 2x2 blocks, but not always). These appear to be the 'source' patterns.\n4.  **Output Pattern:** The output grid largely preserves the dividing lines. However, the content *within* the regions is significantly transformed.\n5.  **Row-Based Color Propagation:** The key observation is that the non-zero, non-divider color found in the *leftmost* region of a given *row of regions* in the input determines the single color used to fill *all* regions in that same row of regions in the output.\n6.  **Fixed Base Pattern:** There is a specific, fixed spatial pattern used to fill the output regions. This pattern uses only the propagated color (from step 5) and the background color (`0`). Crucially, this base pattern seems *constant* for a given task instance (i.e., the same pattern shape is used for color `1`, `2`, and `3` in `train_1`, and a *different* fixed pattern shape is used for `1`, `2`, `4`, `8` in `train_2`). This base pattern shape appears to be derived from the output generated for the top-left region.\n\n### Facts\n\n"

Define this as the `base_pattern`, representing the non-zero color as a placeholder 'C'.\n3.  **Determine Fill Colors:** For each horizontal row of regions in the `input_grid` (e.g., rows 0 to N-1, rows N+1 to 2N, etc.):\n    a.  Examine the *leftmost* region in that row (cols 0 to N-1).\n    b.  Find the first color value within this region that is *not* 0 and *not* the `divider_color`.\n    c.  Record this color as the `fill_color` associated with this entire row of regions.\n4.  **Construct Output Grid:**\n    a.  Create a new grid, initially a copy of the `input_grid`.\n    b.  Iterate through all the `regions` defined by the `dividing_lines`.\n    c.  If a region is *not* part of a `dividing_line` row or column:\n        i.

Apply the `base_pattern` (from Step 2) to this region in the output grid, replacing the placeholder 'C' with the retrieved `fill_color`.\n    d.  Regions that are part of the `dividing_lines` remain unchanged from the initial copy of the input.\n5.  Return the constructed `output_grid`."
