objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - cells: containing integer values (colors)
      - dimensions: H x W
      - divider_color: an integer color value forming full dividing lines
      - dividing_lines: horizontal and vertical lines composed of the divider_color
      - regions: square subgrids defined by the dividing_lines
      - region_size: N x N dimension of the regions
      - pattern_cells: cells within input regions containing non-zero, non-divider colors
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - cells: containing integer values (colors)
      - dimensions: H x W (same as input)
      - divider_color: same as input
      - dividing_lines: preserved from input
      - regions: same partitioning as input
      - region_fill_color: the single non-zero color used within an output region
      - base_pattern: a fixed N x N template used to fill output regions, consisting of 0s and a placeholder for the region_fill_color

relationships:
  - type: partitioning
    subject: dividing_lines
    object: input_grid
    details: Dividing lines partition the input_grid into regions.
  - type: preservation
    subject: dividing_lines
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    details: Dividing lines are copied directly from input to output.
  - type: determination (fill color)
    subject: pattern_cells in the leftmost region of a row of regions (input_grid)
    object: region_fill_color for all regions in that same row (output_grid)
    details: The first non-zero, non-divider color found in the input's leftmost region dictates the fill color for the entire corresponding row of regions in the output.
  - type: determination (base pattern shape)
    subject: output pattern of the top-left region (output_grid, rows 0..N-1, cols 0..N-1)
    object: base_pattern used for all non-divider regions
    details: The specific spatial arrangement of 0s and the fill color in the top-left output region defines the template (base_pattern) used everywhere else.
  - type: application (filling)
    subject: base_pattern
    object: non-divider regions in output_grid
    details: Each non-divider region in the output is filled by applying the base_pattern, substituting the placeholder with the determined region_fill_color for its row.
