The core transformation appears to be a selective filtering or removal of certain colored cells based on the colors of their immediate neighbors.\n\n1.  **Input/Output:** Both input and output are 2D grids of integers.\n2.  **Colors:** Non-zero integers represent distinct colors or types. Zero represents the background.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation modifies the input grid by changing some non-zero cells to zero. Cells that are initially zero remain zero.\n4.  **Rule:** The decision to change a cell's value from non-zero to zero depends on the values of its adjacent cells (8 neighbours - Moore neighborhood). Specifically, a non-zero cell's value is reset to zero if it has at least one neighbour with a different, non-zero value that is *smaller* than its own value. Otherwise, the cell retains its original value. This implies a priority system where higher-valued colors \"yield\" to adjacent lower-valued colors by being removed at the interface.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"

Let the value of this cell be `V`.\n3.  If `V` is equal to 0, proceed to the next cell without changing the output grid.\n4.  If `V` is not 0, examine the values of all 8 neighbouring cells (those at `(r-1, c-1)` to `(r+1, c+1)`, excluding `(r, c)` itself, and ensuring they are within the grid boundaries).\n5.  Check if there is at least one neighbour `N` whose value `V_N` meets all the following conditions:\n    *   `V_N` is not 0.\n    *   `V_N` is not equal to `V`.\n    *   `V_N` is less than `V`.\n6.  If one or more neighbours satisfy these conditions, change the value of the cell `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to 0.\n7.  If *no* neighbour satisfies all these conditions, the value of the cell `(r, c)` in the output grid remains unchanged (it keeps the original value `V`).\n8.  After processing all cells, the final state of the output grid represents the result of the transformation."
