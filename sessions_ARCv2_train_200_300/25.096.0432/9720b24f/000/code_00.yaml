task_elements:
  - name: Grid
    type: 2D Array
    description: Represents the spatial layout containing cells with integer values (colors).
  - name: Cell
    type: Element
    description: A single location within the grid defined by row and column coordinates.
    properties:
      - value: Integer representing a color (0 for background, non-zero for specific colors).
      - coordinates: (row, column) pair.
  - name: Neighbourhood
    type: Relationship
    description: The set of 8 cells directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a given cell.
    properties:
      - connectivity: Moore (8-way)

actions:
  - name: Filter Cell Value
    input: Cell (target) and its Neighbourhood
    output: Modified Cell value (potentially 0)
    logic: >
      Compare the target cell's value (V) with the values (VN) of its neighbours.
      If V is non-zero AND there exists at least one neighbour N such that VN is non-zero, VN is not equal to V, and VN < V,
      then the target cell's value becomes 0 in the output grid.
      Otherwise, the target cell's value remains V in the output grid.

relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    between: [Cell, Cell]
    details: Defined by the Neighbourhood definition.
  - type: Value Comparison
    between: [Cell Value, Cell Value]
    details: Determines the outcome of the Filter Cell Value action based on relative magnitude (V > VN).

constants:
  - name: Background Value
    value: 0
    role: Represents empty space, does not participate in filtering comparisons other than being ignored (VN != 0).
