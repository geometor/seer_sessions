## Perception

The input and output are 15x15 grids of integers.
The input grid contains a rectangular frame made of the digit 3, enclosing an area primarily filled with 0s. Sometimes, there are isolated 3s within this enclosed area. The area outside the frame is filled with 0s.
The output grid retains the 0s outside the frame and the frame itself (the 3s).
The transformation occurs within the area enclosed by the 3s frame.
The 0s inside the frame are replaced with either 2s or 4s. The isolated 3s within the frame remain unchanged.
The digit 4 appears in cells that were originally 0 but are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to any cell containing a 3 (either part of the outer frame or an isolated internal 3).
The digit 2 appears in cells that were originally 0 and are *not* adjacent to any cell containing a 3. They are typically surrounded by 4s or other 2s within the enclosed area.
Essentially, the task involves identifying the region bounded by the outer frame, recognizing internal obstacles (3s), and then performing a conditional fill on the internal 0s based on their adjacency to any 3s.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all cells in the input grid that belong to the rectangular frame (value 3).
3.  Identify all cells located strictly inside the boundary defined by the frame.
4.  For each cell (row `r`, column `c`) identified as being inside the frame:
    a.  Check the value of the cell at (`r`, `c`) in the *input* grid.
    b.  If the input value is 0:
        i.  Examine the four adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right) of the cell at (`r`, `c`) in the *input* grid.
        ii. If any of these neighbors has the value 3:
            Assign the value 4 to the cell at (`r`, `c`) in the *output* grid.
        iii. Otherwise (if none of the neighbors has the value 3):
            Assign the value 2 to the cell at (`r`, `c`) in the *output* grid.
    c.  If the input value is 3 (meaning it's an internal obstacle), leave the value as 3 in the *output* grid (already copied in step 1).
5.  Return the modified output grid.
```python
import copy

"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rules:
1. Identifies a rectangular frame made of '3's.
2. Identifies the area inside this frame.
3. For each cell inside the frame that initially contains a '0':
    a. If the cell is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to any '3' (either frame or internal obstacle) in the input grid, its value becomes '4' in the output grid.
    b. Otherwise (if the cell is only adjacent to '0's, '2's, or '4's within the internal area), its value becomes '2' in the output grid.
4. Cells containing '3's (frame and internal obstacles) remain unchanged.
5. Cells outside the frame (initially '0') remain '0'.

import copy

"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rules:
1. Identifies a rectangular frame made of '3's.
2. Identifies the area inside this frame.
3. For each cell inside the frame that initially contains a '0':
    a. If the cell is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to any '3' (either frame or internal obstacle) in the input grid, its value becomes '4' in the output grid.
    b. Otherwise (if the cell is only adjacent to '0's, '2's, or '4's within the internal area), its value becomes '2' in the output grid.
4. Cells containing '3's (frame and internal obstacles) remain unchanged.
5. Cells outside the frame (initially '0') remain '0'.

    # Cell (3,4) is 0. Neighbors: input_grid[3,3]=3. Has '3' neighbor. -> output_grid[3,4] = 4. CORRECT.
    # Cell (4,5) is 0. Neighbors: input_grid[3,5]=0, input_grid[5,5]=0, input_grid[4,4]=0, input_grid[4,6]=0.
    #  WAIT - need to check neighbors in the *input* grid.
    # Cell (4,5) input=0. Neighbors input: (3,5)=0, (5,5)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,6)=0. No 3 neighbor -> output_grid[4,5] = 2. CORRECT. (Example 1)
    # Cell (4,5) input=0. Neighbors input: (3,5)=0, (5,5)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,6)=0. No 3 neighbor -> output_grid[4,5] = 2. CORRECT. (Example 2)

## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: changing internal '0's to '4' if adjacent to a '3' and '2' otherwise, while preserving '3's and external '0's. However, the implementation failed because it incorrectly modified the external '0's, changing them to '2's. This occurred because the code lacked a mechanism to distinguish between '0's inside the frame and '0's outside the frame. The simple bounding box check was insufficient.

The strategy for resolving the errors is to first explicitly identify all '0' cells that are *outside* the main structure formed by the '3's. A common way to do this is using a flood fill or Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the '0' cells on the grid's border. Any '0' cell reachable from the border without crossing a '3' is considered "outside". Once the "outside" '0's are identified, the transformation logic (checking for '3' neighbors to determine '2' or '4') should only be applied to the remaining '0' cells (the "inside" ones).

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's analyze the differences more systematically. We need to confirm the assumption that the errors primarily involve external '0's being changed to '2's.

```
**Analysis Findings:**

1.  **Grid Dimensions:** Consistently 15x15.
2.  **Outer Zeros:** In all failed examples, exactly 108 pixels that should have remained '0' were incorrectly changed to '2'. This confirms the primary issue is the lack of differentiation between internal and external '0's. The number 108 corresponds to the number of '0' cells outside the frame structure.
3.  **Internal Mismatches:** There are also mismatches *inside* the frame's bounding box (4 in Ex1, 12 in Ex2, 23 in Ex3). This indicates that while the core logic (check neighbors -> 4 if 3, else 2) is applied, the `transformed_output` based on the previous code doesn't perfectly match the `expected_output` even for the internal cells. This might be due to subtle errors in the previous code's neighbor check or application timing, or the simple bounding box check being insufficient even for internal classification. The flood-fill approach should resolve this by correctly identifying *all* internal '0's.
4.  **Frame Preservation:** The frame cells ('3's) were correctly preserved (0 mismatches).

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Identify all '0' cells in the input grid that are connected to the border of the grid through a path consisting entirely of '0' cells. Mark these as "external zeros". (This can be done using a flood fill or similar search starting from all '0's on the edge rows/columns).
3.  Iterate through each cell (row `r`, column `c`) of the input grid.
4.  If the cell at (`r`, `c`) in the input grid has a value of 0 AND it was *not* marked as an "external zero" in step 2:
    a.  Examine the four adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right) of the cell at (`r`, `c`) in the *input* grid.
    b.  If any of these neighbors has the value 3:
        Assign the value 4 to the cell at (`r`, `c`) in the *output* grid.
    c.  Otherwise (if none of the neighbors has the value 3):
        Assign the value 2 to the cell at (`r`, `c`) in the *output* grid.
5.  All other cells (those with value 3 in the input, and those identified as "external zeros") retain their original values as copied in step 1.
6.  Return the final output grid.
