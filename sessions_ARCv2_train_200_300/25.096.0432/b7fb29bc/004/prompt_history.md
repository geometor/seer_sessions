## Perception

The input and output are 15x15 grids of integers.
The input grid contains a rectangular frame made of the digit 3, enclosing an area primarily filled with 0s. Sometimes, there are isolated 3s within this enclosed area. The area outside the frame is filled with 0s.
The output grid retains the 0s outside the frame and the frame itself (the 3s).
The transformation occurs within the area enclosed by the 3s frame.
The 0s inside the frame are replaced with either 2s or 4s. The isolated 3s within the frame remain unchanged.
The digit 4 appears in cells that were originally 0 but are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to any cell containing a 3 (either part of the outer frame or an isolated internal 3).
The digit 2 appears in cells that were originally 0 and are *not* adjacent to any cell containing a 3. They are typically surrounded by 4s or other 2s within the enclosed area.
Essentially, the task involves identifying the region bounded by the outer frame, recognizing internal obstacles (3s), and then performing a conditional fill on the internal 0s based on their adjacency to any 3s.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all cells in the input grid that belong to the rectangular frame (value 3).
3.  Identify all cells located strictly inside the boundary defined by the frame.
4.  For each cell (row `r`, column `c`) identified as being inside the frame:
    a.  Check the value of the cell at (`r`, `c`) in the *input* grid.
    b.  If the input value is 0:
        i.  Examine the four adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right) of the cell at (`r`, `c`) in the *input* grid.
        ii. If any of these neighbors has the value 3:
            Assign the value 4 to the cell at (`r`, `c`) in the *output* grid.
        iii. Otherwise (if none of the neighbors has the value 3):
            Assign the value 2 to the cell at (`r`, `c`) in the *output* grid.
    c.  If the input value is 3 (meaning it's an internal obstacle), leave the value as 3 in the *output* grid (already copied in step 1).
5.  Return the modified output grid.
```python
import copy

"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rules:
1. Identifies a rectangular frame made of '3's.
2. Identifies the area inside this frame.
3. For each cell inside the frame that initially contains a '0':
    a. If the cell is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to any '3' (either frame or internal obstacle) in the input grid, its value becomes '4' in the output grid.
    b. Otherwise (if the cell is only adjacent to '0's, '2's, or '4's within the internal area), its value becomes '2' in the output grid.
4. Cells containing '3's (frame and internal obstacles) remain unchanged.
5. Cells outside the frame (initially '0') remain '0'.
