Sometimes, there are isolated 3s within this enclosed area. The area outside the frame is filled with 0s.\nThe output grid retains the 0s outside the frame and the frame itself (the 3s).\nThe transformation occurs within the area enclosed by the 3s frame.\nThe 0s inside the frame are replaced with either 2s or 4s. The isolated 3s within the frame remain unchanged.\nThe digit 4 appears in cells that were originally 0 but are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to any cell containing a 3 (either part of the outer frame or an isolated internal 3).\nThe digit 2 appears in cells that were originally 0 and are *not* adjacent to any cell containing a 3. They are typically surrounded by 4s or other 2s within the enclosed area.\nEssentially, the task involves identifying the region bounded by the outer frame, recognizing internal obstacles (3s), and then performing a conditional fill on the internal 0s based on their adjacency to any 3s.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
