import copy

"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rules:
1. Identifies a rectangular frame made of '3's.
2. Identifies the area inside this frame.
3. For each cell inside the frame that initially contains a '0':
    a. If the cell is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to any '3' (either frame or internal obstacle) in the input grid, its value becomes '4' in the output grid.
    b. Otherwise (if the cell is only adjacent to '0's, '2's, or '4's within the internal area), its value becomes '2' in the output grid.
4. Cells containing '3's (frame and internal obstacles) remain unchanged.
5. Cells outside the frame (initially '0') remain '0'.

    # The problem might be that outer 0s *do* have 0 neighbours, leading them to be changed to 2.
    # Let's refine: Only change a 0 to 2 IF it has at least one non-zero neighbour that isn't 3.
    # This is getting complicated. Let's revert to the simplest interpretation matching the NL Program step 4.

    # Re-run simpler logic mentally:
    # Cell (0,0) is 0. Neighbors out of bounds or 0. No '3' neighbor. -> output_grid[0][0] = 2. INCORRECT. It should stay 0.
    # Cell (3,4) is 0. Neighbors: input_grid[3,3]=3. Has '3' neighbor. -> output_grid[3,4] = 4. CORRECT.
    # Cell (4,5) is 0. Neighbors: input_grid[3,5]=0, input_grid[5,5]=0, input_grid[4,4]=0, input_grid[4,6]=0.
    #  WAIT - need to check neighbors in the *input* grid.
    # Cell (4,5) input=0. Neighbors input: (3,5)=0, (5,5)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,6)=0. No 3 neighbor -> output_grid[4,5] = 2. CORRECT. (Example 1)
    # Cell (4,5) input=0. Neighbors input: (3,5)=0, (5,5)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,6)=0. No 3 neighbor -> output_grid[4,5] = 2. CORRECT. (Example 2)

    # It seems the simple logic DOES work for the examples provided. The outer 0s are left alone because they were copied initially,
