            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: changing internal '0's to '4' if adjacent to a '3' and '2' otherwise, while preserving '3's and external '0's. However, the implementation failed because it incorrectly modified the external '0's, changing them to '2's. This occurred because the code lacked a mechanism to distinguish between '0's inside the frame and '0's outside the frame. The simple bounding box check was insufficient.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors is to first explicitly identify all '0' cells that are *outside* the main structure formed by the '3's. A common way to do this is using a flood fill or Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the '0' cells on the grid's border. Any '0' cell reachable from the border without crossing a '3' is considered \"outside\". Once the \"outside\" '0's are identified, the transformation logic (checking for '3' neighbors to determine '2' or '4') should only be applied to the remaining '0' cells (the \"inside\" ones).\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the differences more systematically. We need to confirm the assumption that the errors primarily involve external '0's being changed to '2's.\n\n"

This confirms the primary issue is the lack of differentiation between internal and external '0's. The number 108 corresponds to the number of '0' cells outside the frame structure.\n3.  **Internal Mismatches:** There are also mismatches *inside* the frame's bounding box (4 in Ex1, 12 in Ex2, 23 in Ex3). This indicates that while the core logic (check neighbors -> 4 if 3, else 2) is applied, the `transformed_output` based on the previous code doesn't perfectly match the `expected_output` even for the internal cells. This might be due to subtle errors in the previous code's neighbor check or application timing, or the simple bounding box check being insufficient even for internal classification. The flood-fill approach should resolve this by correctly identifying *all* internal '0's.\n4.  **Frame Preservation:** The frame cells ('3's) were correctly preserved (0 mismatches).\n\n## Updated Facts\n\n"
