            "text": "## Perception\n\nThe task involves processing a grid of integers. Each input grid is characterized by the presence of horizontal and vertical bands composed entirely of zeros, effectively dividing the grid into four distinct quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right). These quadrants contain sub-patterns of non-zero numbers, potentially alongside zeros. The output is always a subgrid corresponding exactly to one of these four quadrants. The core challenge is to identify the dividing zero bands and then determine the specific rule used to select which of the four quadrants becomes the output. The selection logic appears based on the numerical values present within the quadrants.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Find the largest contiguous block of rows where all elements are zero. Determine the starting row index (`hr_start`) and ending row index (`hr_end`) of this block.\n    b.  Find the largest contiguous block of columns where all elements are zero. Determine the starting column index (`vc_start`) and ending column index (`vc_end`) of this block.\n3.  **Define Quadrants:** Using the indices found in step 2, define the four subgrids corresponding to the Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR) quadrants.\n    *   TL: Rows 0 to `hr_start - 1`, Columns 0 to `vc_start - 1`.\n    *   TR: Rows 0 to `hr_start - 1`, Columns `vc_end + 1` to end.\n    *   BL: Rows `hr_end + 1` to end, Columns 0 to `vc_start - 1`.\n    *   BR: Rows `hr_end + 1` to end, Columns `vc_end + 1` to end.\n4.  **Analyze Quadrant Contents:**\n    a.  For each quadrant, create a set of its unique non-zero integer values.\n    b.  Identify all non-zero values present across the entire grid.\n    c.  For each non-zero value, determine in which quadrants it appears.\n5.  **Identify Unique Values:** Create a list of numbers that appear in exactly one quadrant.\n6.  **Select Quadrant based on Uniqueness:**\n    a.  If the list of uniquely located numbers is not empty:\n        i.  Find the maximum value (`max_unique`) in this list.\n        ii. Identify the single quadrant that contains `max_unique`. This is the target quadrant.\n    b.  If the list of uniquely located numbers is empty (i.e., all non-zero numbers appear in multiple quadrants or no non-zero numbers exist):\n        i.  Find the overall maximum non-zero value (`M`) present in the input grid.\n        ii. Create a list of quadrants that contain this value `M`.\n        iii. Apply a priority rule to select the target quadrant from this list: BR has the highest priority, followed by BL, then TR, then TL.\n7.  **Generate Output:** Return the subgrid corresponding to the target quadrant identified in step 6."
