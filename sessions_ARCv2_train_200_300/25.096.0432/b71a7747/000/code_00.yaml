Task: Grid Sub-selection based on Content

Objects:
  - Input_Grid: A 2D array of integers.
  - Output_Grid: A 2D array of integers, derived from the Input_Grid.
  - Content_Numbers: A set of integers considered significant for the transformation. These are the numbers that appear in the Output_Grid.
  - Background_Numbers: A set of integers present in the Input_Grid but not in the Output_Grid. They act as separators or padding.
  - Content_Rows: A list of row indices from the Input_Grid that contain at least one Content_Number.
  - Content_Columns: A list of column indices from the Input_Grid that contain at least one Content_Number.

Properties:
  - Input_Grid: Has dimensions (height_in, width_in). Contains both Content_Numbers and Background_Numbers.
  - Output_Grid: Has dimensions (height_out, width_out), where height_out <= height_in and width_out <= width_in. Contains only Content_Numbers. height_out is the count of Content_Rows. width_out is the count of Content_Columns.
  - Content_Numbers: Determined by the unique values present in the Output_Grid example.

Relationships:
  - The Output_Grid is composed of elements Input_Grid[r][c] where 'r' is an index in Content_Rows and 'c' is an index in Content_Columns.
  - The relative order of rows and columns from the Input_Grid is preserved in the Output_Grid.

Actions:
  1. Identify the set of Content_Numbers (e.g., by observing the unique numbers in the provided Output_Grid example).
  2. Scan the Input_Grid to determine the Content_Rows (rows containing any Content_Number).
  3. Scan the Input_Grid to determine the Content_Columns (columns containing any Content_Number).
  4. Construct the Output_Grid by extracting elements from the Input_Grid located at the intersections of Content_Rows and Content_Columns.
