"""
Extracts a subgrid from the input grid based on 'content' numbers.

The transformation identifies rows and columns in the input grid that contain 
specific 'content' numbers. The elements at the intersection of these 
selected rows and columns form the output grid, preserving their relative order.

The 'content' numbers themselves are determined heuristically by checking for 
the presence of indicator numbers (9 or 3) observed in the training examples. 
If 9 is present in the input, the content numbers are assumed to be {8, 9}. 
Otherwise, if 3 is present, they are assumed to be {3, 8}. If neither indicator 
is present, the transformation cannot be reliably performed with this heuristic, 
and an empty grid is returned.
