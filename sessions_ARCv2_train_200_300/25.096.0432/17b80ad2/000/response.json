Within each column, non-zero numbers seem to \"fall downwards\", filling the zero cells below them until another non-zero number is encountered in the same column. The original non-zero numbers remain in their positions, but also propagate their value downwards into subsequent zero cells.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
