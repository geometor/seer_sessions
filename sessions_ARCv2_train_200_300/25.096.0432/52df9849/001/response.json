For each shape, its bounding box is calculated. \nThe output color of a cell is determined by finding all shapes whose bounding boxes cover that cell and selecting the numerically highest color value among them. \nIf a cell is not covered by any non-background shape's bounding box, it retains the background color.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Determine the background color (assumed to be grid[0][0]).\n2. Initialize a data structure `potential_colors` (grid of sets) to store, for each cell (r, c), the set of colors from shapes whose bounding boxes cover (r, c).\n3. Initialize a `visited` grid for BFS.\n4. Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the input grid:\n    a. If the cell contains a non-background color and hasn't been visited yet:\n        i. Perform BFS starting from (r, c) to find all connected cells (`shape_cells`) of the same color. Mark these cells as visited.\n        ii. Calculate the bounding box (`min_r`, `min_c`, `max_r`, `max_c`) of `shape_cells`.\n        iii. For every cell (`rr`, `cc`) within this bounding box, add the current shape's color (`cell_color`) to the set `potential_colors[rr][cc]`.\n5. Initialize an `output_grid` with the background color.\n6. Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the grid:\n    a. If `potential_colors[r][c]` is not empty, set `output_grid[r][c]` to the maximum value in the set `potential_colors[r][c]`.\n    b. Otherwise, `output_grid[r][c]` remains the background color.\n7.
