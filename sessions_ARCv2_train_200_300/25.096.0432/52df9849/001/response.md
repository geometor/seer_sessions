"""
Transforms the input grid by resolving overlaps between different colored shapes based on color value priority.

The transformation identifies contiguous regions (shapes) of non-background colors. For each shape, its bounding box is calculated. 
The output color of a cell is determined by finding all shapes whose bounding boxes cover that cell and selecting the numerically highest color value among them. 
If a cell is not covered by any non-background shape's bounding box, it retains the background color.

Algorithm:
1. Determine the background color (assumed to be grid[0][0]).
2. Initialize a data structure `potential_colors` (grid of sets) to store, for each cell (r, c), the set of colors from shapes whose bounding boxes cover (r, c).
3. Initialize a `visited` grid for BFS.
4. Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the input grid:
    a. If the cell contains a non-background color and hasn't been visited yet:
        i. Perform BFS starting from (r, c) to find all connected cells (`shape_cells`) of the same color. Mark these cells as visited.
        ii. Calculate the bounding box (`min_r`, `min_c`, `max_r`, `max_c`) of `shape_cells`.
        iii. For every cell (`rr`, `cc`) within this bounding box, add the current shape's color (`cell_color`) to the set `potential_colors[rr][cc]`.
5. Initialize an `output_grid` with the background color.
6. Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the grid:
    a. If `potential_colors[r][c]` is not empty, set `output_grid[r][c]` to the maximum value in the set `potential_colors[r][c]`.
    b. Otherwise, `output_grid[r][c]` remains the background color.
7. Return `output_grid`.
