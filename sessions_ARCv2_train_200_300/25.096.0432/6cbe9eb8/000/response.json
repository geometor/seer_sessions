The input grids contain repeating background patterns (like `0 1 2 3`, `0 1 2`, or `0 1`) and embedded rectangular structures. These structures are defined by a solid border of a single digit (e.g., `8` in train_1, `3` in train_2 and train_3), which is distinct from the immediate background pattern. The content inside the border can vary. The output grid corresponds exactly to the largest such bordered rectangle found within the input grid, including its border.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
