task_elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - contains: background_pattern (repeating sequence)
      - contains: bordered_rectangle (one or more)
  - object: bordered_rectangle
    properties:
      - shape: rectangle
      - border: composed of a single, uniform digit (border_digit)
      - interior: can contain various digits
      - location: embedded within the input_grid
      - size: defined by width and height
    relationships:
      - distinct_from: background_pattern (the border_digit is not part of the immediate background sequence)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - content: identical to the largest bordered_rectangle from the input_grid
    relationships:
      - derived_from: input_grid
      - corresponds_to: the bordered_rectangle with the maximum area

actions:
  - action: identify_rectangles
    description: Scan the input_grid to find all rectangular regions enclosed by a solid border of a single digit.
  - action: determine_largest
    description: Calculate the area (width * height) for each identified bordered_rectangle and select the one with the maximum area.
  - action: extract_subgrid
    description: Copy the portion of the input_grid corresponding to the selected largest bordered_rectangle (including its border).
  - action: output_result
    description: Return the extracted subgrid.
