            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for these examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output:** The task takes a 2D grid (matrix) of integers as input and produces another 2D grid of the same dimensions as output.\n2.  **Key Elements:** The non-zero integers in the input grid are the primary actors. The zero values represent a background.\n3.  **Transformation Goal:** The output grid is generated by \"painting\" regions based on the non-zero values from the input grid. Each non-zero value in the input seems to claim a territory in the output grid.\n4.  **Proximity Rule:** The value assigned to an output cell `(r_out, c_out)` is determined by the value of the *closest* non-zero input cell `(r_in, c_in)`. Closeness is measured using Manhattan distance: `|r_out - r_in| + |c_out - c_in|`.\n5.  **Tie-Breaking:** If an output cell is equidistant from two or more non-zero input cells, the value assigned comes from the input cell with the smallest row index (`r_in`). If there's still a tie (multiple closest input cells in the same row), the one with the smallest column index (`c_in`) is chosen.\n6.  **Parity Constraint:** There's an additional condition for painting. A non-zero value `v` from the chosen closest input cell `(v, r_in, c_in)` is only placed at the output cell `(r_out, c_out)` if the column index of the output cell (`c_out`) has the same parity (both even or both odd) as the column index of the input cell (`c_in`). That is, `c_out % 2 == c_in % 2`. If the parities do not match, the output cell remains 0, even if it's closest to a non-zero input cell.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
