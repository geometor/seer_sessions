## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanism: assigning values based on the closest non-zero input cell using Manhattan distance, applying tie-breaking rules (minimum row, then minimum column), and a column parity constraint.

However, the comparison between the `Expected Output` and the `Transformed Output` reveals a significant discrepancy. The initial code assigns a value to *every* cell that satisfies the parity constraint with its closest input cell. The expected outputs show large regions remaining zero, particularly in areas equidistant between two or more input cells.

This suggests an additional rule: **a cell is only colored if it is *strictly* closer to its winning input cell than to any *other* non-zero input cell.** If a cell is equidistant to two or more input cells (even if tie-breaking selects a winner), it should remain zero. The parity rule still applies as a final filter.

**Strategy:**

1.  Modify the logic to calculate distances from the output cell to *all* non-zero input cells.
2.  Determine the *winning* input cell using the established minimum distance and tie-breaking rules.
3.  Check if the minimum distance (to the winning cell) is *strictly less* than the distance to *any other* non-zero input cell.
4.  If this strict inequality holds *and* the column parities match, assign the winning cell's value. Otherwise, assign 0.

## Metrics

Let's analyze the number of non-zero input cells and the grid dimensions, as these influence the complexity of finding the closest cell and applying the strict distance check.

import numpy as np

def analyze_example(name, input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    input_np = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_np = np.array(expected_output)
    transformed_np = np.array(transformed_output)

    non_zero_inputs = np.count_nonzero(input_np)
    rows, cols = input_np.shape
    pixels_off = np.sum(expected_np != transformed_np)
    total_pixels = rows * cols
    error_rate = pixels_off / total_pixels if total_pixels > 0 else 0

    print(f"--- {name} ---")

    print(f"  Pixels Off in Previous Attempt: {pixels_off}")
    print(f"  Total Pixels: {total_pixels}")
    print(f"  Error Rate: {error_rate:.2%}")
    # Count cells that are non-zero in transformed but zero in expected (over-painting)
    overpainted = np.sum((transformed_np != 0) & (expected_np == 0))
    # Count cells that are zero in transformed but non-zero in expected (under-painting)
    underpainted = np.sum((transformed_np == 0) & (expected_np != 0))
    print(f"  Over-painted Cells (Mistake): {overpainted}")
    print(f"  Under-painted Cells (Mistake): {underpainted}")

**Metrics Analysis:**

The metrics confirm the visual observation:
*   **Non-zero Inputs:** The number of active points is small (2 or 3).
*   **Over-painted Cells:** In all examples, the number of cells incorrectly painted non-zero (`Over-painted`) is substantial, confirming that the previous logic was too aggressive in assigning values. These correspond to the cells equidistant between input points.
*   **Under-painted Cells:** There are also `Under-painted` cells. This seems counter-intuitive initially, but likely arises because the previous logic might have chosen the *wrong* winning cell in some equidistant cases due to only comparing against the minimum distance found so far, not necessarily the *true* tie-breaking winner across *all* equidistant cells, leading to parity mismatches where the correct winner would have matched parity. The strict comparison rule should resolve this.

Objects:
  - InputGrid:
      Properties:
        - rows: Integer
        - columns: Integer
        - cells: List[List[Integer]]
  - OutputGrid:
      Properties:
        - rows: Integer
        - columns: Integer
        - cells: List[List[Integer]] (initialized to 0)
  - InputCell:
      Properties:
        - value: Integer (non-zero)
        - row: Integer
        - column: Integer
  - OutputCell:
      Properties:
        - value: Integer
        - row: Integer
        - column: Integer

Properties:
  - ManhattanDistance: Integer (calculated between an OutputCell and an InputCell)
  - ColumnParity: Integer (0 for even, 1 for odd)
  - DistancesToAllInputs: List[Tuple[distance: Integer, InputCell]] (for a given OutputCell)

Actions:
  - FindNonZeroInputCells: Identify all InputCells with value > 0 in the InputGrid. Store as a list.
  - CalculateAllDistances: For a given OutputCell, compute ManhattanDistance to *every* non-zero InputCell. Store these distances along with the corresponding InputCell record.
  - FindWinningInputCell:
      - Find the minimum ManhattanDistance among all calculated distances for the OutputCell.
      - Identify all InputCells matching this minimum distance.
      - ApplyTieBreaking: If multiple InputCells are closest, select based on minimum row, then minimum column. This is the 'WinningInputCell'.
  - CheckStrictDominance:
      - Compare the minimum distance (to the WinningInputCell) with the distances to *all other* non-zero InputCells.
      - Return `True` if the minimum distance is strictly less than all other distances. Return `False` otherwise (i.e., if the OutputCell is equidistant to the WinningInputCell and at least one other InputCell).
  - CheckColumnParity: Compare the ColumnParity of an OutputCell's column and the WinningInputCell's column.
  - AssignOutputValue: Set the value of an OutputCell based on the WinningInputCell's value, *only if* CheckStrictDominance returns `True` *and* CheckColumnParity indicates a match. Otherwise, the value remains 0.

Relationships:
  - Each OutputCell's potential value is determined by its WinningInputCell (closest after tie-breaking).
  - The assignment of this value is conditional on the OutputCell being *strictly* closer to the WinningInputCell than to any other non-zero InputCell.
  - The assignment is further conditional on the relationship between the OutputCell's column parity and the WinningInputCell's column parity.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all non-zero cells in the `InputGrid`. For each, record its value (`v`), row index (`r_in`), and column index (`c_in`). Store these as a list of `InputCell` records. Let `N` be the number of non-zero cells found.
2.  Create an `OutputGrid` with the same dimensions as the `InputGrid`, initializing all its cells to 0.
3.  If `N` is 0, return the initialized `OutputGrid`.
4.  Iterate through each cell `(r_out, c_out)` in the `OutputGrid`.
5.  For the current `OutputCell` at `(r_out, c_out)`:
    a.  Calculate the Manhattan distance `d_i = |r_out - r_in_i| + |c_out - c_in_i|` from this `OutputCell` to *every* non-zero `InputCell` `i` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `N`). Store these distances along with references to the corresponding `InputCells`.
    b.  Find the minimum distance (`min_dist`) among all calculated distances `d_i`.
    c.  Identify all `InputCells` that correspond to this `min_dist`.
    d.  From this set of closest `InputCells`, select the single "winning" `InputCell` by choosing the one with the smallest `r_in`. If there is still a tie (multiple cells have the same minimum `r_in`), choose the one among them with the smallest `c_in`. Let the chosen winning cell be `(v*, r*_in, c*_in)`.
    e.  **Strict Dominance Check:** Determine if the `min_dist` (the distance to the winning cell `(v*, r*_in, c*_in)`) is strictly less than the distance `d_j` to *every other* non-zero `InputCell` `j` (where `j` is not the winning cell index). If `N` is 1, this condition is automatically true.
    f.  **Column Parity Check:** Check if the column index of the current `OutputCell` (`c_out`) has the same parity as the column index of the winning `InputCell` (`c*_in`). That is, check if `c_out % 2 == c*_in % 2`.
    g.  If the **Strict Dominance Check** is true AND the **Column Parity Check** is true, set the value of the `OutputCell` at `(r_out, c_out)` to `v*`.
    h.  Otherwise (if the cell is equidistant to another input cell OR the parities don't match), leave the value of the `OutputCell` at `(r_out, c_out)` as 0.
6.  After iterating through all `OutputCells`, the `OutputGrid` is complete. Return it.
