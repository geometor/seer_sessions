Objects:
  - InputGrid:
      Properties:
        - rows: Integer
        - columns: Integer
        - cells: List[List[Integer]]
  - OutputGrid:
      Properties:
        - rows: Integer
        - columns: Integer
        - cells: List[List[Integer]] (initialized to 0)
  - InputCell:
      Properties:
        - value: Integer (non-zero)
        - row: Integer
        - column: Integer
  - OutputCell:
      Properties:
        - value: Integer
        - row: Integer
        - column: Integer

Properties:
  - ManhattanDistance: Integer (calculated between an OutputCell and an InputCell)
  - ColumnParity: Integer (0 for even, 1 for odd)
  - DistancesToAllInputs: List[Tuple[distance: Integer, InputCell]] (for a given OutputCell)

Actions:
  - FindNonZeroInputCells: Identify all InputCells with value > 0 in the InputGrid. Store as a list.
  - CalculateAllDistances: For a given OutputCell, compute ManhattanDistance to *every* non-zero InputCell. Store these distances along with the corresponding InputCell record.
  - FindWinningInputCell:
      - Find the minimum ManhattanDistance among all calculated distances for the OutputCell.
      - Identify all InputCells matching this minimum distance.
      - ApplyTieBreaking: If multiple InputCells are closest, select based on minimum row, then minimum column. This is the 'WinningInputCell'.
  - CheckStrictDominance:
      - Compare the minimum distance (to the WinningInputCell) with the distances to *all other* non-zero InputCells.
      - Return `True` if the minimum distance is strictly less than all other distances. Return `False` otherwise (i.e., if the OutputCell is equidistant to the WinningInputCell and at least one other InputCell).
  - CheckColumnParity: Compare the ColumnParity of an OutputCell's column and the WinningInputCell's column.
  - AssignOutputValue: Set the value of an OutputCell based on the WinningInputCell's value, *only if* CheckStrictDominance returns `True` *and* CheckColumnParity indicates a match. Otherwise, the value remains 0.

Relationships:
  - Each OutputCell's potential value is determined by its WinningInputCell (closest after tie-breaking).
  - The assignment of this value is conditional on the OutputCell being *strictly* closer to the WinningInputCell than to any other non-zero InputCell.
  - The assignment is further conditional on the relationship between the OutputCell's column parity and the WinningInputCell's column parity.
