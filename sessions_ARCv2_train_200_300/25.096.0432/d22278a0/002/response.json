            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanism: assigning values based on the closest non-zero input cell using Manhattan distance, applying tie-breaking rules (minimum row, then minimum column), and a column parity constraint.\n\nHowever, the comparison between the `Expected Output` and the `Transformed Output` reveals a significant discrepancy. The initial code assigns a value to *every* cell that satisfies the parity constraint with its closest input cell. The expected outputs show large regions remaining zero, particularly in areas equidistant between two or more input cells.\n\nThis suggests an additional rule: **a cell is only colored if it is *strictly* closer to its winning input cell than to any *other* non-zero input cell.** If a cell is equidistant to two or more input cells (even if tie-breaking selects a winner), it should remain zero. The parity rule still applies as a final filter.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Modify the logic to calculate distances from the output cell to *all* non-zero input cells.\n2.  Determine the *winning* input cell using the established minimum distance and tie-breaking rules.\n3.  Check if the minimum distance (to the winning cell) is *strictly less* than the distance to *any other* non-zero input cell.\n4.  If this strict inequality holds *and* the column parities match, assign the winning cell's value. Otherwise, assign 0.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's analyze the number of non-zero input cells and the grid dimensions, as these influence the complexity of finding the closest cell and applying the strict distance check.\n\n"
