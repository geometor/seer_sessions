"""
The transformation modifies an input grid based on its background color (most frequent color). 
It applies modifications in a specific order:
1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Identify the background color (most frequent value in the input).
3. Modify specific rows and/or columns: Cells matching the background color in designated lines are changed to a specific fill color. Modification along a line can be conditional based on the cell's coordinate in the other dimension (e.g., even index, index range).
4. Handle intersections: The cell at the intersection of a modified row and modified column might be set to a special corner value, overriding the line modifications.
5. Apply specific cell overrides: Individual cells identified for the specific task instance are set to designated values, overriding any previous modifications at those locations.

The exact rows, columns, fill colors, conditions, corner values, and specific cell overrides are determined by analyzing the patterns in each input/output pair.
