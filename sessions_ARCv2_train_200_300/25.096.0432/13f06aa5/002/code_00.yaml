task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  cell_content: integer_numbers
  size_constraint: output_grid_same_size_as_input_grid
objects:
  - input_grid: A 2D array of integers.
  - output_grid: A 2D array of integers, derived from the input_grid.
  - rows: Horizontal lines of cells in the grid.
  - columns: Vertical lines of cells in the grid.
  - cells: Individual elements within the grid, identified by row and column index.
properties:
  - cell_value: The integer contained within a cell.
  - row_index: The vertical position of a cell/row (0-based).
  - column_index: The horizontal position of a cell/column (0-based).
  - grid_height: Number of rows.
  - grid_width: Number of columns.
  - background_color: The most frequent cell value in the input grid.
  - modification_target_value: The specific cell value targeted for change (usually the background_color).
  - fill_color: The new value assigned to modified cells. Multiple fill colors can exist per task.
  - special_rows: Specific rows targeted for modification (e.g., row 0, row 8, last row).
  - special_columns: Specific columns targeted for modification (e.g., col 0, col 5, last col).
  - index_condition: A condition based on row or column index (e.g., even/odd index, index >= 4) that gates modification within a line.
  - corner_value: A specific value assigned to the intersection of a modified row and column, potentially overriding line modifications.
  - specific_cell_overrides: A list of (row, column, new_value) tuples specifying individual cell changes that occur after line and corner modifications.
actions:
  - copy_grid: Initialize the output grid with the contents of the input grid.
  - identify_background_color: Determine the most frequent value in the input grid.
  - identify_modification_parameters: Determine the specific rows, columns, fill colors, index conditions, corner value, and specific cell overrides for the task instance.
  - modify_line_conditionally: Iterate through cells in a specified row or column. If a cell's value matches the background color AND any index condition is met, change its value in the output grid to the corresponding fill color.
  - modify_corner: Set the value of the cell at the intersection of a modified row and column to the corner value, if specified. This happens after line modifications.
  - apply_specific_cell_overrides: Iterate through the list of specific cell overrides and set the corresponding cells in the output grid to their specified new values. This happens last.
relationships:
  - Line modification depends on the original cell value matching the background color.
  - Line modification location is specific (certain rows, columns).
  - Line modification value (fill color) can depend on the location (row vs. column).
  - Modification within a line can be conditional on the other index (e.g., even columns in a specific row).
  - Corner modifications override line modifications at the intersection point.
  - Specific cell overrides overwrite any previous modifications at their location.
