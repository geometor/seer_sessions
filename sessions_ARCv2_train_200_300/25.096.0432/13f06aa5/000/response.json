The transformation appears to modify specific rows, columns, or individual cells based on certain rules that might involve the cell's original value, its row/column index, and potentially index parity (even/odd). The background color (the most frequent number in the input) often seems to be the target for changes. New colors are introduced in the modified locations. In some cases, the intersection of modified rows and columns receives a special value (like 0).\n\n## YAML Fact Documentation\n\n"

If the cell at `(special_row, column)` in the `input_grid` contains the `modification_target_value` AND any associated `index_condition` (applied to the column index) is met, update the corresponding cell in the `output_grid` with the row's `fill_color`.\n    *   For each `special_column`: Iterate through its rows.
