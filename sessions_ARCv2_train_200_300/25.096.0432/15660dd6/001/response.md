"""
Transforms an input grid containing blocks separated by '8' borders.

The transformation involves the following steps:
1.  **Identify Blocks:** Parse the input grid to find rectangular blocks defined by '8' borders.
2.  **Extract Block Information:** For each block, extract its inner content (shape), the primary digit forming the shape ('shape_digit', typically not '1' or '8'), and the identifier digit from the first column of the rows the block occupies ('row_identifier'). Also determine the block's column index within the grid of blocks.
3.  **Group by Column:** Group the extracted block information based on their column index.
4.  **Select Winning Block per Column:** For each column, select the block that has the numerically highest 'shape_digit'. If multiple blocks share the maximum digit, any one of them can be chosen (the current implementation uses the one found last by `max`).
5.  **Construct Output Grid:** Assemble the output grid horizontally. For each selected block:
    *   Create an output block of the same dimensions as the inner shape.
    *   Fill the output block: Place the original shape using its 'shape_digit'. Fill the remaining cells (background) with the block's 'row_identifier'.
    *   Append this generated block to the output grid.
    *   Place a column of '8's as a separator between adjacent blocks in the output.
