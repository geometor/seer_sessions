Also determine the block's column index within the grid of blocks.\n3.  **Group by Column:** Group the extracted block information based on their column index.\n4.  **Select Winning Block per Column:** For each column, select the block that has the numerically highest 'shape_digit'. If multiple blocks share the maximum digit, any one of them can be chosen (the current implementation uses the one found last by `max`).\n5.  **Construct Output Grid:** Assemble the output grid horizontally. For each selected block:\n    *   Create an output block of the same dimensions as the inner shape.\n    *   Fill the output block: Place the original shape using its 'shape_digit'. Fill the remaining cells (background) with the block's 'row_identifier'.\n    *   Append this generated block to the output grid.\n    *   Place a column of '8's as a separator between adjacent blocks in the output.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_blocks(grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[dict]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies blocks within the grid, extracting their inner content,\n    shape digit, row identifier, and position.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input grid (list of lists of ints).\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a block\n        and contains keys: 'inner_grid', 'shape_digit', 'row_identifier',\n        'top', 'left', 'height', 'width', 'block_col'.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    if rows < 3 or cols < 3: # Need at least 1x1 inner block with borders\n        return []\n\n    blocks = []\n    visited_inner_corners = set() # To avoid processing the same block multiple times\n\n    # Iterate through potential top-left corners of the *inner* block area\n    for r in range(1, rows -
