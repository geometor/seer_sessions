    properties:
      - type: digit
      - location: first column of the rows defining a horizontal sequence of blocks in the input_grid
      - associated_with: all blocks in its row

    properties:
      - type: lines of digits
      - value: 8
      - separates: blocks in input_grid, shapes in output_grid

actions:
  - name: parse_input
    actor: system
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: identified_blocks (with shape, shape_digit, row_identifier)
    description: Divide the input grid into blocks based on '8' borders and identify the row identifier and inner shape for each block.
  - name: select_blocks
    actor: system
    inputs: identified_blocks (grouped by column)
    outputs: selected_block_info (shape, row_identifier) for each column
    description: For each column of input blocks, find the block whose shape_digit has the maximum numerical value.
  - name: construct_output
    actor: system
    inputs: selected_block_info (ordered by input column)
    outputs: output_grid
    description: Create the output grid by placing the selected shapes horizontally, filling the background of each shape's block with its corresponding row_identifier, and separating blocks with columns of '8's.

relationships:
  - type: selection_criterion
    subject: block
    object: shape_digit
    detail: The block with the maximum shape_digit value within a column is selected.
  - type: representation
    subject: output_block
    object: selected_input_block
    detail: The output block contains the shape of the selected input block, with the background determined by the input block's row_identifier.
