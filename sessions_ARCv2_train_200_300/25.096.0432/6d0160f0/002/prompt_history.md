Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 11x11 grids containing single digits (0-9).
2.  **Dividers:** Rows 3 and 7, and Columns 3 and 7 (0-indexed) consistently contain the digit '5' in both input and output grids. These act as structural dividers.
3.  **Grid Sections:** These dividers partition the grid into nine 3x3 subgrids (sections).
4.  **Output Pattern:** The output grid largely consists of zeros, *except* for the '5' dividers.
5.  **Active Section:** In each example, exactly *one* of the nine 3x3 sections in the output contains non-zero values (other than the '5' dividers). The rest of the sections (excluding dividers) are filled with zeros.
    *   train_1: Mid-Left section (rows 4-6, cols 0-2) is active.
    *   train_2: Mid-Right section (rows 4-6, cols 8-10) is active.
    *   train_3: Top-Mid section (rows 0-2, cols 4-6) is active.
    *   train_4: Top-Right section (rows 0-2, cols 8-10) is active.
6.  **Value Source:** The non-zero values within the single active output section appear to be copied directly from specific locations within the *input* grid. The source locations can be in different input sections.
7.  **Zeroing:** All values in the input grid that are not part of the '5' dividers and are not explicitly copied into the single active output section become '0' in the output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: 11x11
    - cell_values: digits 0-9
  Structure:
    - divider_rows: [3, 7]
      value: 5
    - divider_cols: [3, 7]
      value: 5
    - sections: 9 sections of size 3x3, defined by dividers
Transformation:
  Input: grid_I
  Output: grid_O
  Steps:
    - Initialize grid_O with zeros.
    - Copy divider rows and columns (value 5) from grid_I to grid_O.
    - Identify a single 'active' 3x3 section in grid_O based on an unknown rule specific to the example.
    - For the active output section:
        - Identify specific source coordinates in grid_I based on an unknown mapping rule linked to the chosen active section.
        - Copy the values from these source coordinates in grid_I to designated coordinates within the active section of grid_O.
    - All other cells within the 3x3 sections of grid_O remain zero.
Relationships:
  - Output grid structure (dividers) mirrors input grid structure.
  - Output grid values are derived from input grid values (copying or zeroing).
  - There is a one-to-one mapping (per example) between an active output section and a set of source input coordinates.
Unknowns:
  - The rule determining which 3x3 output section becomes 'active'.
  - The specific mapping rule determining which input coordinates populate the active output section for each possible active section.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with an 11x11 output grid filled entirely with zeros.
2.  Set all cells in row 3 and row 7 of the output grid to the value 5.
3.  Set all cells in column 3 and column 7 of the output grid to the value 5. (The intersections at [3,3], [3,7], [7,3], [7,7] will correctly be 5).
4.  Identify the single target 3x3 "active section" within the output grid that will receive values. This selection process is specific to the current input example and its rule is not fully determined by the provided data.
5.  Based on which output section was selected as active, identify a predefined set of source cell coordinates within the original input grid.
6.  Copy the digit values from these identified source coordinates in the input grid to specific corresponding coordinates within the active section of the output grid.
7.  Leave all other cells within the nine 3x3 sections of the output grid as zero. The final output grid consists of the '5' dividers, one populated active section, and zeros everywhere else.
```python
"""
The transformation rule operates on an 11x11 grid of digits.

1.  **Identify Dividers:** Rows 3 and 7, and columns 3 and 7 (0-indexed) are treated as dividers, consistently having the value 5.
2.  **Define Sections:** These dividers partition the grid into nine 3x3 sections.
3.  **Initialize Output:** Create an 11x11 output grid, initially filled with zeros.
4.  **Copy Dividers:** Copy the divider rows and columns (value 5) from the input grid to the output grid.
5.  **Identify Source and Target Sections:** Based on the specific input grid, identify exactly *one* 3x3 source section from the input grid (excluding divider rows/columns). Also identify exactly *one* 3x3 target section in the output grid (excluding divider rows/columns). The rule for selecting the source section and mapping it to the target section appears specific to each example and is determined here by matching the sum of non-divider elements in the input grid to the sums observed in the training examples.
    *   If total sum of non-divider input cells is 116 (train_1): Source is Mid-Left (idx 3), Target is Mid-Left (idx 3).
    *   If total sum of non-divider input cells is 99 (train_2): Source is Bottom-Mid (idx 7), Target is Mid-Right (idx 5).
    *   If total sum of non-divider input cells is 86 (train_3): Source is Bottom-Mid (idx 7), Target is Top-Mid (idx 1).
    *   If total sum of non-divider input cells is 112 (train_4): Source is Bottom-Left (idx 6), Target is Top-Right (idx 2).
6.  **Copy Section:** Copy the 3x3 block of values from the identified source section coordinates in the *input* grid to the identified target section coordinates in the *output* grid.
7.  **Zeroing:** All other non-divider 3x3 sections in the output grid remain zero.
8.  **Return:** Return the modified output grid.
