These act as structural dividers.\n3.  **Grid Sections:** These dividers partition the grid into nine 3x3 subgrids (sections).\n4.  **Output Pattern:** The output grid largely consists of zeros, *except* for the '5' dividers.\n5.  **Active Section:** In each example, exactly *one* of the nine 3x3 sections in the output contains non-zero values (other than the '5' dividers). The rest of the sections (excluding dividers) are filled with zeros.\n    *   train_1: Mid-Left section (rows 4-6, cols 0-2) is active.\n    *   train_2: Mid-Right section (rows 4-6, cols 8-10) is active.\n    *   train_3: Top-Mid section (rows 0-2, cols 4-6) is active.\n    *   train_4: Top-Right section (rows 0-2, cols 8-10) is active.\n6.  **Value Source:** The non-zero values within the single active output section appear to be copied directly from specific locations within the *input* grid. The source locations can be in different input sections.\n7.  **Zeroing:** All values in the input grid that are not part of the '5' dividers and are not explicitly copied into the single active output section become '0' in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

This selection process is specific to the current input example and its rule is not fully determined by the provided data.\n5.  Based on which output section was selected as active, identify a predefined set of source cell coordinates within the original input grid.\n6.  Copy the digit values from these identified source coordinates in the input grid to specific corresponding coordinates within the active section of the output grid.\n7.  Leave all other cells within the nine 3x3 sections of the output grid as zero. The final output grid consists of the '5' dividers, one populated active section, and zeros everywhere else."
