Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: 11x11
    - cell_values: digits 0-9
  Structure:
    - divider_rows: [3, 7]
      value: 5
    - divider_cols: [3, 7]
      value: 5
    - sections: 9 sections of size 3x3, defined by dividers
Transformation:
  Input: grid_I
  Output: grid_O
  Steps:
    - Initialize grid_O with zeros.
    - Copy divider rows and columns (value 5) from grid_I to grid_O.
    - Identify a single 'active' 3x3 section in grid_O based on an unknown rule specific to the example.
    - For the active output section:
        - Identify specific source coordinates in grid_I based on an unknown mapping rule linked to the chosen active section.
        - Copy the values from these source coordinates in grid_I to designated coordinates within the active section of grid_O.
    - All other cells within the 3x3 sections of grid_O remain zero.
Relationships:
  - Output grid structure (dividers) mirrors input grid structure.
  - Output grid values are derived from input grid values (copying or zeroing).
  - There is a one-to-one mapping (per example) between an active output section and a set of source input coordinates.
Unknowns:
  - The rule determining which 3x3 output section becomes 'active'.
  - The specific mapping rule determining which input coordinates populate the active output section for each possible active section.
