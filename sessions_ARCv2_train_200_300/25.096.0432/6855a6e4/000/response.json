These seem to act as boundaries or containers.\n    *   Value 5 (Red): Forms shapes that change position from input to output (e.g., 'L' shapes, lines). These seem to be mobile elements.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the movement of the red shapes (5). The blue shapes (2) remain fixed. The red shapes move from their initial positions (which become background 0) into the empty space (0) located near or enclosed by the blue shapes. The final position of the red shapes seems to be centralized or contained within the area defined by the blue shapes.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Copy these blue cells to the same locations in the output grid.\n3.  Identify all cells with value 5 (red pattern) in the input grid. Note their locations and relative arrangement (shape).\n4.  Determine the region of empty cells (value 0) in the input grid that is enclosed or bounded by the blue pattern (this is the internal empty space).\n5.  Calculate a target position within this internal empty space for the red pattern. This relocation typically centralizes the red pattern within the available internal empty space or places it within an enclosed area defined by the blue pattern.\n6.
