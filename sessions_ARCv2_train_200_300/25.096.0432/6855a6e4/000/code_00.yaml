objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - size: 15x15
      - contains: integers (0, 2, 5)
  - name: blue_pattern
    properties:
      - value: 2
      - role: static boundary or container
      - location: fixed between input and output
  - name: red_pattern
    properties:
      - value: 5
      - role: mobile element
      - location: changes from input to output
      - shape: preserved during movement
  - name: background
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: empty space
  - name: internal_empty_space
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - location: area within or bounded by the blue_pattern
      - role: target destination for red_pattern

actions:
  - name: identify_elements
    operands: [grid]
    outputs: [blue_pattern, red_pattern, background]
  - name: identify_internal_empty_space
    operands: [grid, blue_pattern]
    outputs: [internal_empty_space]
  - name: clear_original_red_location
    operands: [grid, red_pattern]
    effect: changes original red_pattern locations to background value (0)
  - name: relocate_red_pattern
    operands: [red_pattern, internal_empty_space]
    effect: moves the red_pattern into the internal_empty_space

relationships:
  - type: containment
    subject: red_pattern (output)
    object: internal_empty_space
    description: The final position of the red_pattern is within the internal_empty_space defined by the blue_pattern.
  - type: invariance
    subject: blue_pattern
    description: The blue_pattern's location and shape are identical in the input and output.
  - type: transformation
    subject: red_pattern (input)
    object: red_pattern (output)
    description: The input red_pattern is moved to a new location defined by the internal_empty_space, preserving its shape. Original locations become background.
