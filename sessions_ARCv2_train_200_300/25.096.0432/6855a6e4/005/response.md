"""
The transformation rule operates on a 2D grid containing integers (0, 2, 5).
It identifies a static 'boundary' pattern (value 2) and a mobile 'object' pattern group (value 5).

1.  The boundary pattern (2) remains fixed in its original position in the output grid.
2.  The object pattern group (5), potentially consisting of multiple disconnected components treated as a single entity based on their combined bounding box, is moved from its original location.
3.  The original locations occupied by the object group become background (0) in the output.
4.  A 'target zone' is identified within the input grid. This zone is the largest rectangular area consisting entirely of background cells (0) that fits within the bounding box of the boundary pattern (2).
5.  The object pattern group (5) is then placed onto the output grid. The placement is determined by aligning the center of the object pattern group's bounding box with the center of the identified target zone's bounding box.
6.  The relative spatial arrangement of all cells within the object group (5) is preserved during the move.
7.  If no boundary pattern (2), object pattern (5), or target zone (0s within the boundary) is found, the behavior might default to copying only the boundary or returning an empty/unmodified grid, based on necessity. The current implementation assumes all necessary components exist for the transformation to occur meaningfully.
