Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both 15x15 grids containing integer values.
2.  **Colors/Values:** Three distinct values are present: 0 (background, likely black), 2 (blue), and 5 (red).
3.  **Shapes:** The non-zero values form distinct shapes or patterns within the grid.
    *   Value 2 (Blue): Forms shapes that appear static between input and output (e.g., 'C' shapes, rectangles). These seem to act as boundaries or containers.
    *   Value 5 (Red): Forms shapes that change position from input to output (e.g., 'L' shapes, lines). These seem to be mobile elements.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the movement of the red shapes (5). The blue shapes (2) remain fixed. The red shapes move from their initial positions (which become background 0) into the empty space (0) located near or enclosed by the blue shapes. The final position of the red shapes seems to be centralized or contained within the area defined by the blue shapes.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - size: 15x15
      - contains: integers (0, 2, 5)
  - name: blue_pattern
    properties:
      - value: 2
      - role: static boundary or container
      - location: fixed between input and output
  - name: red_pattern
    properties:
      - value: 5
      - role: mobile element
      - location: changes from input to output
      - shape: preserved during movement
  - name: background
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: empty space
  - name: internal_empty_space
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - location: area within or bounded by the blue_pattern
      - role: target destination for red_pattern

actions:
  - name: identify_elements
    operands: [grid]
    outputs: [blue_pattern, red_pattern, background]
  - name: identify_internal_empty_space
    operands: [grid, blue_pattern]
    outputs: [internal_empty_space]
  - name: clear_original_red_location
    operands: [grid, red_pattern]
    effect: changes original red_pattern locations to background value (0)
  - name: relocate_red_pattern
    operands: [red_pattern, internal_empty_space]
    effect: moves the red_pattern into the internal_empty_space

relationships:
  - type: containment
    subject: red_pattern (output)
    object: internal_empty_space
    description: The final position of the red_pattern is within the internal_empty_space defined by the blue_pattern.
  - type: invariance
    subject: blue_pattern
    description: The blue_pattern's location and shape are identical in the input and output.
  - type: transformation
    subject: red_pattern (input)
    object: red_pattern (output)
    description: The input red_pattern is moved to a new location defined by the internal_empty_space, preserving its shape. Original locations become background.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with an empty 15x15 output grid.
2.  Identify the locations of all cells with value 2 (blue pattern) in the input grid. Copy these blue cells to the same locations in the output grid.
3.  Identify all cells with value 5 (red pattern) in the input grid. Note their locations and relative arrangement (shape).
4.  Determine the region of empty cells (value 0) in the input grid that is enclosed or bounded by the blue pattern (this is the internal empty space).
5.  Calculate a target position within this internal empty space for the red pattern. This relocation typically centralizes the red pattern within the available internal empty space or places it within an enclosed area defined by the blue pattern.
6.  Place the red pattern (identified in step 3) onto the output grid at the calculated target position (step 5), preserving its shape.
