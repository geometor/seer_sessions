objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - size: 15x15
      - contains: integers (0, 2, 5)
  - name: blue_pattern
    properties:
      - value: 2
      - role: static boundary
      - location: fixed between input and output
  - name: red_pattern_group
    properties:
      - value: 5
      - role: mobile element group (can be multiple disconnected shapes)
      - location: changes from input to output
      - relative_shape: preserved during movement (all red cells move together maintaining relative positions)
  - name: background
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: empty space
  - name: internal_empty_space
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - location: region of 0s bounded by the blue_pattern in the input grid
      - role: target destination area for red_pattern_group

actions:
  - name: identify_elements
    operands: [input_grid]
    outputs: [blue_pattern, red_pattern_group, background]
  - name: identify_internal_empty_space
    operands: [input_grid, blue_pattern]
    outputs: [internal_empty_space]
    # Detail: Find 0s within the bounding box of blue_pattern. (Refinement might require flood fill if bbox isn't enough).
  - name: calculate_target_origin
    operands: [red_pattern_group, internal_empty_space]
    outputs: [target_top_left_coordinate]
    # Detail: Center the bounding box of red_pattern_group within the bounding box of internal_empty_space.
  - name: construct_output_grid
    operands: [input_grid_size, blue_pattern, red_pattern_group, target_top_left_coordinate]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    # Detail: Initialize empty grid. Place blue_pattern. Place red_pattern_group at target_top_left_coordinate.

relationships:
  - type: containment
    subject: red_pattern_group (output)
    object: internal_empty_space
    description: The final position of the red_pattern_group is within the area defined by internal_empty_space.
  - type: invariance
    subject: blue_pattern
    description: The blue_pattern's location and shape are identical in the input and output.
  - type: transformation
    subject: red_pattern_group (input)
    object: red_pattern_group (output)
    description: The input red_pattern_group is treated as a single entity and moved to a new location, preserving its internal relative structure. Original locations become background(0).
  - type: centering
    subject: red_pattern_group (output) bounding box
    object: internal_empty_space bounding box
    description: The bounding box of the moved red_pattern_group is centered within the bounding box of the internal_empty_space.
