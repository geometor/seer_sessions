objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - size: 15x15
      - contains: integers (0, 2, 5)
  - name: blue_pattern
    properties:
      - value: 2
      - role: static boundary/container
      - location: fixed between input and output
  - name: red_pattern_group
    properties:
      - value: 5
      - role: mobile object group
      - location: changes from input to output
      - shape: preserved during movement (relative coordinates)
      - representation: treated as a single unit via its combined bounding box
  - name: background
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: empty space
  - name: internal_empty_space
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - location: defined by cells with value 0 within the bounding box of the blue_pattern in the input grid
      - role: target zone for red_pattern_group placement

relationships:
  - type: containment
    subject: internal_empty_space
    object: blue_pattern_bounding_box (input)
    description: The internal_empty_space consists of all background cells within the blue_pattern's bounding box.
  - type: alignment
    subject: red_pattern_group_center (output)
    object: internal_empty_space_center (input)
    description: The center of the red_pattern_group's bounding box in the output aligns with the center of the internal_empty_space's bounding box from the input.
  - type: invariance
    subject: blue_pattern
    description: The blue_pattern's location and shape are identical in the input and output.
  - type: transformation
    subject: red_pattern_group (input)
    object: red_pattern_group (output)
    description: The input red_pattern_group is moved to a new location, preserving its shape, such that its center aligns with the center of the available internal empty space defined by the blue pattern. Original locations become background.
