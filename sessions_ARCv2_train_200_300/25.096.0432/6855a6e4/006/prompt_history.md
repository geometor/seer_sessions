Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both 15x15 grids containing integer values.
2.  **Colors/Values:** Three distinct values are present: 0 (background, likely black), 2 (blue), and 5 (red).
3.  **Shapes:** The non-zero values form distinct shapes or patterns within the grid.
    *   Value 2 (Blue): Forms shapes that appear static between input and output (e.g., 'C' shapes, rectangles). These seem to act as boundaries or containers.
    *   Value 5 (Red): Forms shapes that change position from input to output (e.g., 'L' shapes, lines). These seem to be mobile elements.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the movement of the red shapes (5). The blue shapes (2) remain fixed. The red shapes move from their initial positions (which become background 0) into the empty space (0) located near or enclosed by the blue shapes. The final position of the red shapes seems to be centralized or contained within the area defined by the blue shapes.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with an empty 15x15 output grid.
2.  Identify the locations of all cells with value 2 (blue pattern) in the input grid. Copy these blue cells to the same locations in the output grid.
3.  Identify all cells with value 5 (red pattern) in the input grid. Note their locations and relative arrangement (shape).
4.  Determine the region of empty cells (value 0) in the input grid that is enclosed or bounded by the blue pattern (this is the internal empty space).
5.  Calculate a target position within this internal empty space for the red pattern. This relocation typically centralizes the red pattern within the available internal empty space or places it within an enclosed area defined by the blue pattern.
6.  Place the red pattern (identified in step 3) onto the output grid at the calculated target position (step 5), preserving its shape.
```python
"""
The transformation identifies static blue patterns (value 2) and mobile red patterns (value 5) on a grid.
The blue pattern remains fixed in the output grid.
The red pattern is moved from its original location in the input grid to a new location in the output grid.
The new location for the red pattern is determined by centering its bounding box within the bounding box of the blue pattern.
The original locations of the red pattern become background (value 0) in the output grid.
The shape and relative arrangement of the red pattern cells are preserved during the move.

"""
The transformation rule operates on a 2D grid containing integers (0, 2, 5).
It identifies a static 'boundary' pattern (value 2) and a mobile 'object' pattern group (value 5).

1.  The boundary pattern (2) remains fixed in its original position in the output grid.
2.  The object pattern group (5), potentially consisting of multiple disconnected components treated as a single entity based on their combined bounding box, is moved from its original location.
3.  The original locations occupied by the object group become background (0) in the output.
4.  A 'target zone' is identified within the input grid. This zone is the largest rectangular area consisting entirely of background cells (0) that fits within the bounding box of the boundary pattern (2).
5.  The object pattern group (5) is then placed onto the output grid. The placement is determined by aligning the center of the object pattern group's bounding box with the center of the identified target zone's bounding box.
6.  The relative spatial arrangement of all cells within the object group (5) is preserved during the move.
7.  If no boundary pattern (2), object pattern (5), or target zone (0s within the boundary) is found, the behavior might default to copying only the boundary or returning an empty/unmodified grid, based on necessity. The current implementation assumes all necessary components exist for the transformation to occur meaningfully.
