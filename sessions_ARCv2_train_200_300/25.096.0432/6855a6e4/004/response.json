            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code implementation failed on all training examples. The core issue is that the red pattern (value 5) was not moved from its original input position to the intended target position in the output grid. The blue pattern (value 2) was correctly identified and placed, and the original red pattern locations were correctly cleared (implicitly, as the output started from zeros and only blue/red were added).\n\nThe failure lies in the logic for determining the target location for the red pattern. The previous hypothesis centered the red pattern's bounding box within the bounding box of *all zero cells* located inside the blue pattern's bounding box. This definition of the \"internal empty space\" appears incorrect.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-evaluate Target Area Definition:** The target area seems to be a specific, often contiguous, region of zeros that is enclosed or framed by the blue pattern. It's not just *any* zero within the blue bounding box. We need a more precise way to identify this target sub-region. Comparing the input `internal_zeros` (within the blue bbox) to the actual locations where the red pattern lands in the *expected output* will be crucial.\n2.  **Refine Placement Calculation:** Once the correct target area is identified, the centering logic (placing the red pattern's bounding box center at the target area's bounding box center) should be re-verified against the examples.\n3.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect the more accurate understanding of the target area identification and placement rule.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"

This confirms the red pattern moves into a region that was originally zero in the input.\n3.  **Target Area vs. Internal Zeros (BBox Method):** Comparing `target_zero_area_bbox` with `input_internal_zeros_bbox_method_bbox` reveals they are different. The initial method of defining the target space (all zeros within the blue bounding box) is incorrect. The actual target area is a specific subset of those zeros.\n4.  **Placement Rule:** The red pattern seems to be placed such that its bounding box *exactly matches* the bounding box of the specific \"target zero area\" it occupies. This isn't necessarily centering the red pattern within the target area; rather, the *extent* of the moved red pattern defines the extent previously occupied by the target zeros. This implies we need to identify the correct contiguous block of internal zeros first, determine its bounding box, and then place the red pattern relative to *that* specific bounding box, likely aligning the top-left corners or centers. The examples show the red pattern perfectly fitting into a rectangular sub-region of the internal zeros. The most consistent interpretation seems to be: find the specific rectangular block of zeros inside the blue structure, find the bounding box of this block, and then center the *red pattern's bounding box* within *this specific target block's bounding box*.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
