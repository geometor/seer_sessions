            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are grids of numbers (representing colors).\n2.  **Symmetry Axis:** In both examples, there's a clear vertical line of symmetry or separation. This line uses the same color as the outer border of the grid (color '2' in train\\_1, color '4' in train\\_2).\n3.  **Regions:** This vertical line divides the grid into two main regions: a left region and a right region.\n4.  **Source and Target:** The left region appears to be the \"source\" of patterns, and the right region is the \"target\" where modifications occur. The left region remains unchanged from input to output.\n5.  **Background Colors:** Each region has a dominant \"background\" color.\n    *   In train\\_1: Left background is '1', Right background is '4'.\n    *   In train\\_2: Left background is '1', Right background is '2'.\n6.  **Foreground Patterns:** The source (left) region contains islands or patterns made of colors different from its background (e.g., '3' and '8' on background '1' in train\\_1; '8' on background '1' in train\\_2).\n7.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves mirroring the *foreground patterns* from the left region onto the right region, replacing the right region's original background color. The background color of the left region itself is *not* mirrored; where the left background occurs, the right region retains its original background color.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

This column typically uses the same color as the grid's outer border and divides the grid content area roughly in half. Note its column index (`separator_index`) and color.\n3.  **Identify Regions:** Define the source region as columns to the left of `separator_index` and the target region as columns to the right of `separator_index`.\n4.  **Determine Background Colors:**\n    *   Find the most frequent color in the source region (excluding the separator/border color if applicable, though in these examples it's clearly '1'). This is the `source_background_color`.\n    *   Determine the uniform color filling the target region in the *input* grid. This is the `target_background_color`.\n5.  **Process Target Region:** Iterate through each cell (`r`, `c`) in the target region (where `c` > `separator_index`).\n6.  **Calculate Mirrored Source Coordinates:** For the current target cell (`r`, `c`), calculate the column index of its mirrored counterpart in the source region: `mirrored_c = separator_index - (c - separator_index)`. The row index `r` remains the same.\n7.  **Check Source Color:** Get the color (`source_color`) from the input grid at the mirrored source coordinates (`r`, `mirrored_c`).\n8.  **Apply Transformation Rule:**\n    *   If `source_color` is *not* equal to the `source_background_color`, update the cell (`r`, `c`) in the output grid with `source_color`.\n    *   If `source_color` *is* equal to the `source_background_color`, the cell (`r`, `c`) in the output grid retains the `target_background_color` (which it already has from the initial copy, so no change is needed here, but explicitly: set output cell (`r`, `c`) to `target_background_color`).\n9.  **Finalize:** The modified grid is the final output. The source region, separator column, and border remain unchanged from the input."
