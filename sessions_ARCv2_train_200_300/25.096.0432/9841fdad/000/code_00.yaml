task_name: mirror_patterns_across_separator
description: Mirrors foreground patterns from the left half of a grid onto the right half, preserving the right half's background color.

grid_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties: [rows, columns, cells]
  - type: cell
    properties: [row_index, column_index, color_value]
  - type: region
    properties: [boundary, background_color, foreground_patterns]
  - type: separator
    properties: [axis, location, color_value]
    description: A vertical line dividing the grid. Its color matches the grid border.

regions:
  - name: source_region
    location: left_half
    properties: [background_color, foreground_patterns]
    description: The region to the left of the separator. Contains patterns to be copied. Remains unchanged in the output.
  - name: target_region
    location: right_half
    properties: [background_color]
    description: The region to the right of the separator. Initially filled with a single background color. Is modified in the output.

actions:
  - name: identify_separator
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [separator_column_index, separator_color]
    description: Find the vertical column that divides the grid and has the same color as the border.
  - name: identify_regions_and_backgrounds
    inputs: [input_grid, separator_column_index]
    outputs: [source_region_details, target_region_details]
    description: Determine the background colors for the source (left) and target (right) regions.
  - name: mirror_patterns
    inputs: [input_grid, separator_column_index, source_background_color, target_background_color]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    description: Create the output grid by mirroring non-background colors from the source region onto the target region across the separator axis.

relationships:
  - type: mirroring
    subject: source_region_foreground_patterns
    object: target_region
    predicate: mirrored_onto
    details: Patterns are mirrored horizontally across the separator column.
  - type: preservation
    subject: target_region_background_color
    predicate: preserved_at_mirrored_source_background_locations
    details: The target background color remains where the mirrored source location contains the source background color.
  - type: identity
    subject: source_region
    predicate: remains_unchanged
    details: The source region in the output is identical to the source region in the input.
  - type: identity
    subject: separator_column
    predicate: remains_unchanged
    details: The separator column in the output is identical to the separator column in the input.
  - type: identity
    subject: border
    predicate: remains_unchanged
    details: The border cells in the output are identical to the border cells in the input.
