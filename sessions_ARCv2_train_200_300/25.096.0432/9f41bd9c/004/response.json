            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the core components (pattern '5', barrier '6', background '1'), the pattern movement logic (horizontal flip), and the barrier marker '9' placement logic.\n\nThe discrepancy between the expected and transformed outputs stems from the **diagonal trace generation**. The previous logic allowed the trace ('5's) to extend into the rectangular bounding box occupied by the *moved* pattern, overwriting background '1's where it should have stopped.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the trace termination condition. The trace originating from each '5' in the input pattern should stop if the *next* diagonal step would land:\n1.  Outside the grid boundaries.\n2.  At or below the first row of the barrier ('6's).\n3.  **Inside the rectangular bounding box defined for the moved pattern.** This is the key correction.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics gathered via `code_execution` confirm the environment for each example:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Shape: (17, 17)\n*   Original '5' Bounds: Rows [4, 10], Cols [12, 16] (Width=5)\n*   Barrier '6' Row Index: 11\n*   Movement: Left (since 12 >= 17/2)\n*   Moved '5' Bounds: Rows [4, 10], Cols [0, 4]\n*   Expected '9' Range: Columns [5, 16] (inclusive) at row 11.\n*   Trace Error Check: Trace should stop if the next step `(nr, nc)` satisfies `4 <= nr <= 10` AND `0 <= nc <= 4`.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Shape: (16, 16)\n*   Original '5' Bounds: Rows [6, 10], Cols [0, 4] (Width=5)\n*   Barrier '6' Row Index: 11\n*   Movement: Right (since 0 < 16/2)\n*   Moved '5' Bounds: Rows [6, 10], Cols [11, 15]\n*   Expected '9' Range: Columns [0, 12] (inclusive) at row 11.\n*   Trace Error Check: Trace should stop if the next step `(nr, nc)` satisfies `6 <= nr <= 10` AND `11 <= nc <= 15`.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
