            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for these grid examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\nThe task involves transforming an input grid containing numbers (primarily 1, 5, 6) into an output grid. The core elements appear to be:\n\n1.  **Grid:** A 2D array of integers. The dimensions vary between examples.\n2.  **Background:** The number '1' seems to represent the background or empty space.\n3.  **Pattern:** A distinct connected group of cells containing the number '5'. Its position varies (right side in example 1, left side in example 2).\n4.  **Barrier:** A block of rows at the bottom filled with the number '6'.\n5.  **Movement:** The '5' pattern is moved horizontally to the opposite side of the grid in the output.\n6.  **Trace:** A diagonal \"smear\" or trace of '5's appears in the output, extending from the *original* position of the '5' pattern. The direction of the trace (Down-Left or Down-Right) depends on which side the pattern started on. The trace avoids overwriting the moved pattern and stops when it hits the '6' barrier or goes out of bounds.\n7.  **Marker:** The number '9' appears only in the output, specifically within the first row of the '6' barrier. The horizontal extent of these '9's seems determined by where the diagonal traces first hit the barrier and the magnitude/direction of the pattern's movement.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
