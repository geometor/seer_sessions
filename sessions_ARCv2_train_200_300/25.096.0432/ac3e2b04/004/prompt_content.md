"""
Transforms the input grid by identifying background cells (value 0) that are "enclosed" and not connected to the grid's outer border via a path of other background cells (0) or pattern cells (3). Cells with value 2 act as impassable barriers for this connectivity check. All enclosed background cells (0) are changed to value 1 in the output. Cells with values 2 and 3, and background cells connected to the border, remain unchanged.
