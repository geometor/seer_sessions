These lines persist from input to output.\n    *   `3`: Forms specific patterns (like small 'H' shapes, often centered around a `2`). These patterns also persist from input to output.\n    *   `1`: This color exclusively appears in the output grid. It replaces some of the `0`s from the input.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The fundamental change is the conversion of certain `0` cells into `1` cells.\n4.  **Spatial Relationship:** The `1`s appear in regions that seem \"enclosed\" or \"internal\". The boundaries of these regions are primarily formed by the `2`s and potentially the grid edges. The `3` patterns exist within or near these regions but don't block the transformation of `0`s to `1`s.\n5.  **Mechanism:** The transformation behaves like a \"fill\" operation. Specifically, it identifies `0` cells that are *not* connected to the outer border of the grid via a path of other `0`s. The `2`s act as impassable barriers for this connectivity check.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all background cells (value `0`) located on the outermost border (top row, bottom row, leftmost column, rightmost column) of the input grid.\n3.  Perform a flood fill or connectivity search (like BFS or DFS) starting simultaneously from *all* these border background cells.\n4.  This search should only propagate through adjacent (up, down, left, right) background cells (value `0`). Cells with value `2` act as barriers and cannot be entered or traversed. Cells with value `3` do not act as barriers. Mark all reachable background cells during this search.\n5.  After the search is complete, iterate through every cell in the input grid.\n6.  If a cell contains a background value (`0`) but was *not* marked as reachable during the border flood fill search, change its value in the output grid to `1`.\n7.  All other cells (original `2`s, `3`s, and the `0`s that *were* reachable from the border) retain their original values in the output grid.\n8.  The final modified grid is the result."
