Grid:
  Type: 2D array of integers
  Properties:
    - rows: variable
    - columns: variable
  Contains:
    - Grid Lines
    - Sections

Grid Lines:
  Type: Horizontal or Vertical lines
  Properties:
    - Composed of a single, repeating non-zero integer (GridSeparatorValue)
    - Thickness: 1 cell
  Function: Partition the grid into Sections

Sections:
  Type: Rectangular areas within the grid
  Defined by: Grid Lines and Grid Boundaries
  Contains:
    - Content Cells (integers)
  Properties:
    - Can be 'Empty' (all content cells are 0)
    - Can contain a 'Pattern' (non-zero, non-GridSeparatorValue integers)

Relationships:
  - Sections can be 'Vertically Adjacent' (share a horizontal Grid Line boundary)

Actions:
  - Identify GridSeparatorValue and locate Grid Lines.
  - Identify Section boundaries.
  - Check if a Section is 'Empty'.
  - Check if a Section contains a 'Pattern'.
  - If an Empty Section is Vertically Adjacent to a Pattern Section:
      - Copy the Pattern from the Pattern Section.
      - Flip the copied Pattern vertically.
      - Place the flipped Pattern into the Empty Section (in the output grid).

Output Grid Generation:
  - Starts as a copy of the Input Grid.
  - Modified by applying the copy-and-flip Action where conditions are met.
  - Grid Lines and unchanged Sections remain identical to the Input Grid.
