            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both 2D grids of integers.\n2.  **Grid Lines:** There are prominent horizontal and vertical lines composed of a single, repeating non-zero integer (e.g., '2' in `train_1`, '6' in `train_2`). These lines act as separators.\n3.  **Sections:** The grid lines partition the grid into distinct rectangular sections or cells.\n4.  **Patterns:** Within some sections (excluding the grid lines themselves), there are patterns formed by other non-zero integers (e.g., '3' and '1' in `train_1`, '4' in `train_2`). Other sections contain only zeros.\n5.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation modifies the content of some sections based on the content of their vertically adjacent neighbors. The grid lines themselves remain unchanged.\n6.  **Core Operation:** The key operation seems to be a conditional copy-and-flip. If a section contains only zeros and its immediate vertical neighbor (above or below) contains a pattern, that pattern is copied into the zero-filled section but flipped vertically.\n\n## YAML Documentation of Facts\n\n"

Store these section boundaries.\n4.  **Iterate Through Vertical Pairs:** Loop through all pairs of vertically adjacent sections. For each pair consisting of an upper section (`S_upper`) and a lower section (`S_lower`):\n    *   Define the content area for `S_upper` (rows and columns excluding the surrounding grid lines).\n    *   Define the content area for `S_lower`.\n    *   Extract the content (subgrid) for `S_upper` and `S_lower` from the *input* grid.\n5.  **Check and Apply Transformation (Upper Empty):**\n    *   Check if all values in the content of `S_upper` are 0.\n    *   Check if the content of `S_lower` contains any non-zero, non-`G` values (i.e., a pattern).\n    *   If `S_upper` is empty and `S_lower` has a pattern:\n        *   Get the pattern subgrid from `S_lower`'s content area in the *input* grid.\n        *   Flip this subgrid vertically.\n        *   Place the vertically flipped subgrid into the content area corresponding to `S_upper` in the *output* grid.\n6.  **Check and Apply Transformation (Lower Empty):**\n    *   Check if all values in the content of `S_lower` are 0.\n    *   Check if the content of `S_upper` contains any non-zero, non-`G` values (i.e., a pattern).\n    *   If `S_lower` is empty and `S_upper` has a pattern:\n        *   Get the pattern subgrid from `S_upper`'s content area in the *input* grid.\n        *   Flip this subgrid vertically.\n        *   Place the vertically flipped subgrid into the content area corresponding to `S_lower` in the *output* grid.\n7.  **Finalize:** After checking all vertically adjacent pairs, the modified output grid contains the final result. Return the output grid."
