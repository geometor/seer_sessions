Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (16 rows, 11 columns).
2.  **Cell Values:** The grids contain integer values. Inputs primarily use 0 and 2. Outputs use 0, 2, 3, and 8. '0' appears to be a background color that remains unchanged.
3.  **Regions:** The non-zero elements ('2's) in the input are organized into distinct, spatially separated regions. These regions are connected components of cells containing '2'. In all examples, there are exactly four such regions.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color (value) of the '2's within each region. Some regions keep the color '2', while others change to '3' or '8'.
5.  **Determinants of Change:** The specific color assigned to a region in the output seems to depend on the properties of *all* regions in the input, specifically the count of '2's within each region.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Context: Grid transformation based on regional properties.
Objects:
  - Grid:
      Properties:
        - rows: Integer (e.g., 16)
        - columns: Integer (e.g., 11)
        - cells: List of Lists of Integers
  - Cell:
      Properties:
        - value: Integer (0, 2 in input; 0, 2, 3, 8 in output)
        - position: Tuple (row, column)
  - Region:
      Definition: A connected component of cells with value '2' in the input grid.
      Properties:
        - cells: List of Cell positions
        - size: Integer (count of cells with value '2')
        - top_left_coordinate: Tuple (minimum row, minimum column) of cells in the region
Relationships:
  - Each cell belongs to at most one region (or none if value is 0).
  - There are exactly four Regions in each input grid.
Actions:
  - Identify_Regions: Find all connected components of value '2'.
  - Calculate_Size: Count the number of cells in each Region.
  - Sort_Regions: Order the Regions based on their size (ascending) and then by their top-left coordinate (row, then column) as a tie-breaker.
  - Determine_Count_Pattern: Analyze the sorted list of region sizes to identify if they follow pattern AAAA, AABB, or ABBB.
  - Assign_Color: Assign a new color (2, 3, or 8) to each Region based on its rank in the sorted list and the identified count pattern.
  - Update_Grid: Create the output grid by replacing the original '2's in each region with the newly assigned color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Locate all distinct connected components (regions) consisting of cells with the value '2' in the input grid. Ensure there are exactly four such regions.
2.  **Calculate Properties:** For each identified region, calculate:
    *   Its size (the total count of '2's it contains).
    *   Its
```python
import numpy as np
from collections import deque, defaultdict

"""
The transformation operates on a grid containing multiple distinct shapes formed by the number 2, separated by 0s.
The grid is implicitly divided into 6 zones (3 rows x 2 columns).
The core logic involves:
1. Identifying the connected component of '2's within each of the 6 zones.
2. Calculating the size (number of '2's) of the component in each zone. If a zone has no '2's, its size is 0.
3. Determining the output color (2, 3, or 8) for each zone based on the distribution of sizes across the 6 zones.
    - If all non-empty zones have the same size, a fixed color pattern [8, 2, 8, 3, 2, 2] is applied based on the zone's position (TL, TR, ML, MR, BL, BR).
    - If there are multiple distinct sizes:
        - Zones with a unique size get color 8 if their size is the maximum size present, otherwise color 2.
        - Zones with non-unique sizes get colors assigned based on their original zone index, following specific patterns for the number of zones sharing that size (e.g., for 3 zones sharing a size, the colors are [3, 8, 2] assigned to the zones in increasing index order; for 5 zones, the pattern is [2, 8, 8, 2, 3]).
4. Creating the output grid by replacing the '2's in each zone with the determined color for that zone.
