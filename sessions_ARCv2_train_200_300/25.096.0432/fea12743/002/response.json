            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code incorrectly assumed a fixed division of the grid into 6 zones. The results demonstrate that this zonal approach fails to capture the true transformation logic. The errors indicate that the color assignment rule is wrong, likely because the method of identifying and grouping the relevant shapes ('2' components) and the criteria for color assignment were based on the faulty zone assumption.\n\nThe strategy is to abandon the fixed zone concept and instead focus on:\n1.  **Accurate Component Identification:** Identify *all* distinct connected components of '2's in the entire input grid.\n2.  **Property Calculation:** Determine the key properties of each component, specifically its size (cell count) and location (e.g., top-left coordinate).\n3.  **Pattern Analysis:** Analyze the relationship between the properties (especially sizes) of *all* identified components within a grid.\n4.  **Rule Derivation:** Formulate a new rule for assigning output colors (2, 3, or 8) based on the analysis of component properties, likely involving sorting the components and examining the pattern of their sizes.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nWe need to accurately identify components, their sizes, and locations for each training example.\n\n"
