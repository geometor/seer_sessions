"""
The transformation identifies connected components of '2's in the input grid.
It selects the 6 largest components based on size (descending), breaking ties with top-left coordinates (row ascending, then column ascending).
These 6 selected components are then assigned new colors (2, 3, or 8) based on the rank of their size and the number of components sharing that rank.
All other components retain the color '2'.

Detailed Steps:
1. Find all connected components of value '2'. Record their coordinates, size, and top-left coordinate.
2. Sort the components primarily by size (descending), secondarily by top-left row (ascending), and tertiarily by top-left column (ascending). Select the top 6 components.
3. Determine the unique sizes among these top 6 components. Sort these unique sizes ascendingly to establish ranks (rank 1 = smallest size, rank 2 = next smallest, etc.).
4. Group the top 6 components based on the rank of their size.
5. Define a mapping of (rank, count_in_rank) pairs to color patterns. This mapping is derived from the training examples:
    - (Rank 1, Count 2): [2, 2]
    - (Rank 1, Count 4): [3, 8, 2, 8]
    - (Rank 1, Count 6): [8, 2, 8, 3, 2, 2]
    - (Rank 2, Count 1): [8]
    - (Rank 2, Count 4): [8, 8, 2, 3]
    - (Rank 3, Count 1): [3]
6. For each rank group:
    - Sort the components within the group by their original top-left coordinates (row ascending, then column ascending).
    - Apply the corresponding color pattern sequentially to the sorted components.
7. Create the output grid, initially copying the input.
8. Iterate through the top 6 components and update their cells in the output grid with their assigned color. Cells belonging to components not in the top 6 remain '2'.
