Identifying the connected component of '2's within each of the 6 zones.\n2. Calculating the size (number of '2's) of the component in each zone. If a zone has no '2's, its size is 0.\n3. Determining the output color (2, 3, or 8) for each zone based on the distribution of sizes across the 6 zones.\n    - If all non-empty zones have the same size, a fixed color pattern [8, 2, 8, 3, 2, 2] is applied based on the zone's position (TL, TR, ML, MR, BL, BR).\n    - If there are multiple distinct sizes:\n        - Zones with a unique size get color 8 if their size is the maximum size present, otherwise color 2.\n        - Zones with non-unique sizes get colors assigned based on their original zone index, following specific patterns for the number of zones sharing that size (e.g., for 3 zones sharing a size, the colors are [3, 8, 2] assigned to the zones in increasing index order; for 5 zones, the pattern is [2, 8, 8, 2, 3]).\n4.
