Inputs primarily use 0 and 2. Outputs use 0, 2, 3, and 8. '0' appears to be a background color that remains unchanged.\n3.  **Regions:** The non-zero elements ('2's) in the input are organized into distinct, spatially separated regions. These regions are connected components of cells containing '2'. In all examples, there are exactly four such regions.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color (value) of the '2's within each region. Some regions keep the color '2', while others change to '3' or '8'.\n5.  **Determinants of Change:** The specific color assigned to a region in the output seems to depend on the properties of *all* regions in the input, specifically the count of '2's within each region.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
