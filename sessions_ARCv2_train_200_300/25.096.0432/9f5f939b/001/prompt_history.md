Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and describe the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids containing integer values. The grids can have varying dimensions.
2.  **Values:** The grids primarily contain the value `8`. The value `1` appears scattered throughout the grids. The value `4` appears *only* in the output grids, replacing specific `8`s from the input.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation is highly localized. Most cells remain unchanged between input and output. The core change involves identifying specific `8`s in the input grid and changing their value to `4` in the output grid.
4.  **Pattern Identification:** The change from `8` to `4` seems to depend on the horizontal neighbors of the cell. By comparing the input and output grids, a specific horizontal pattern emerges around the cells that are modified:
    *   In `train_1`, the `8` at `(5, 4)` changes to `4`. Its horizontal neighbors in the input form the sequence `... 1 1 8 [8] 8 1 1 ...` (cells `(5,1)` to `(5,7)`).
    *   In `train_2`, the `8` at `(4, 3)` changes to `4`. Its horizontal neighbors in the input form the sequence `... 1 1 8 [8] 8 1 1 ...` (cells `(4,0)` to `(4,6)`).
    *   In `train_3`, the `8` at `(5, 10)` changes to `4`. Its horizontal neighbors in the input form the sequence `... 1 1 8 [8] 8 1 1 ...` (cells `(5,7)` to `(5,13)`).
    *   In `train_3`, the `8` at `(11, 12)` changes to `4`. Its horizontal neighbors in the input form the sequence `... 1 1 8 [8] 8 1 1 ...` (cells `(11,9)` to `(11,15)`).
5.  **Rule Formulation:** The consistent pattern observed is `1 1 8 X 8 1 1` horizontally, where `X` is the cell being considered. If `X` is `8` and it is part of this specific 7-cell horizontal sequence `1 1 8 8 8 1 1`, then its value is changed to `4` in the output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Modify grid cells based on a horizontal pattern.

Objects:
  - Grid: A 2D array of integers.
    Properties:
      - rows: Number of rows.
      - cols: Number of columns.
      - cells: Individual elements within the grid.
  - Cell: An element within the Grid.
    Properties:
      - value: Integer (1, 8, or 4 in output).
      - position: (row_index, column_index).
  - Pattern: A specific horizontal sequence of cell values.
    Properties:
      - sequence: [1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1]
      - length: 7
      - target_index: 3 (0-based index of the cell to potentially modify)

Actions:
  - Scan: Iterate through the grid to find occurrences of the Pattern.
  - Compare: Check if a sequence of cells in a row matches the Pattern.
  - Modify: Change the value of a specific cell (the one at target_index within a matched Pattern) from 8 to 4.
  - Copy: Create the output grid initially identical to the input grid.

Relationships:
  - A Cell belongs to a Grid at a specific position.
  - The Modification action is triggered by a successful Compare action.
  - The Scan action iterates through Rows and potential starting columns within each Row.
  - The target cell for Modification is determined by its position relative to the matched Pattern within a Row.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid (the output grid) that is an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from the top row to the bottom row.
3.  For each row, iterate through each possible horizontal starting position (column index `c`) such that a sequence of 7 cells (from `c` to `c+6`) can be examined within the row boundaries.
4.  At each position `(r, c)`, check if the sequence of cell values from `(r, c)` to `(r, c+6)` in the *input* grid exactly matches the pattern `[1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1]`.
5.  If the pattern matches, identify the cell at the 4th position within this sequence (index 3, which corresponds to grid position `(r, c+3)`).
6.  Change the value of the cell at position `(r, c+3)` in the *output* grid to `4`.
7.  After checking all rows and all possible starting positions within each row, the output grid contains the final transformed result. Return the output grid.
