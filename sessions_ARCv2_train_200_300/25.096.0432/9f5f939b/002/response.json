            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core horizontal pattern `[1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1]` responsible for the transformation. However, testing revealed this pattern alone is not sufficient, as shown by the failure in `train_3`. The code incorrectly modified cells `(5, 5)` and `(12, 3)` in addition to the correct modifications.\n\nThe strategy involves refining the conditions under which the modification occurs:\n\n1.  **Analyze Failure Cases:** Compare the contexts (neighboring cells, overlapping patterns) of the correctly modified cells versus the incorrectly modified cells in `train_3`.\n2.  **Formulate New Hypotheses:** Based on the analysis, propose additional conditions. Initial thoughts included checking the cell above, but further analysis suggests a combination of checking the cell above AND potentially resolving conflicts when patterns overlap within a row.\n3.  **Verify Hypotheses:** Test the refined hypotheses against all training examples. The code execution metrics confirmed that the cell above the target `8` must also be an `8`. It also highlighted potential overlaps in patterns within a single row (`train_3`, row 5).\n4.  **Refine Logic:** The final refined logic appears to be: Find all occurrences of the pattern `[1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1]` where the cell directly above the target middle `8` is also `8`. If multiple such valid patterns exist within the same row, only apply the transformation based on the *rightmost* (last occurring) pattern in that row.\n5.  **Update Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect this refined understanding.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nThe key difference observed in `train_3` between the expected output and the initial code's output involves two specific cells:\n\n*   **Cell (5, 5):**\n    *   Input Value: `8`\n    *   Code Output Value: `4`\n    *   Expected Output Value: `8`\n    *   Pattern `[1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1]` found starting at `(5, 2)`. Target is `(5, 5)`.\n    *   Cell above `(4, 5)` value: `8`.\n    *   Another pattern `[1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1]` found starting at `(5, 7)`. Target is `(5, 10)`. Cell above `(4, 10)` is `8`. This modification *is* expected.\n    *   *Observation:* The modification at `(5, 10)` corresponds to the pattern starting further to the right in the row.\n\n*   **Cell (12, 3):**\n    *   Input Value: `8`\n    *   Code Output Value: `4`\n    *   Expected Output Value: `8`\n    *   Pattern `[1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1]` found starting at `(12, 0)`. Target is `(12, 3)`.\n    *   Cell above `(11, 3)` value: `1`.\n    *   *Observation:* The condition that the cell above the target must be `8` is not met.\n\n**Code Execution for Verification:**\n"
