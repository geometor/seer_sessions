**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core horizontal pattern `[1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1]` responsible for the transformation. However, testing revealed this pattern alone is not sufficient, as shown by the failure in `train_3`. The code incorrectly modified cells `(5, 5)` and `(12, 3)` in addition to the correct modifications.

The strategy involves refining the conditions under which the modification occurs:

1.  **Analyze Failure Cases:** Compare the contexts (neighboring cells, overlapping patterns) of the correctly modified cells versus the incorrectly modified cells in `train_3`.
2.  **Formulate New Hypotheses:** Based on the analysis, propose additional conditions. Initial thoughts included checking the cell above, but further analysis suggests a combination of checking the cell above AND potentially resolving conflicts when patterns overlap within a row.
3.  **Verify Hypotheses:** Test the refined hypotheses against all training examples. The code execution metrics confirmed that the cell above the target `8` must also be an `8`. It also highlighted potential overlaps in patterns within a single row (`train_3`, row 5).
4.  **Refine Logic:** The final refined logic appears to be: Find all occurrences of the pattern `[1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1]` where the cell directly above the target middle `8` is also `8`. If multiple such valid patterns exist within the same row, only apply the transformation based on the *rightmost* (last occurring) pattern in that row.
5.  **Update Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect this refined understanding.

**Metrics and Analysis**

The key difference observed in `train_3` between the expected output and the initial code's output involves two specific cells:

*   **Cell (5, 5):**
    *   Input Value: `8`
    *   Code Output Value: `4`
    *   Expected Output Value: `8`
    *   Pattern `[1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1]` found starting at `(5, 2)`. Target is `(5, 5)`.
    *   Cell above `(4, 5)` value: `8`.
    *   Another pattern `[1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1]` found starting at `(5, 7)`. Target is `(5, 10)`. Cell above `(4, 10)` is `8`. This modification *is* expected.
    *   *Observation:* The modification at `(5, 10)` corresponds to the pattern starting further to the right in the row.

*   **Cell (12, 3):**
    *   Input Value: `8`
    *   Code Output Value: `4`
    *   Expected Output Value: `8`
    *   Pattern `[1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1]` found starting at `(12, 0)`. Target is `(12, 3)`.
    *   Cell above `(11, 3)` value: `1`.
    *   *Observation:* The condition that the cell above the target must be `8` is not met.

**Metrics Confirmation:**

*   Pattern at `(5, 2)`: Matches, Cell above target `(5, 5)` is `8`. Valid condition.
*   Pattern at `(5, 7)`: Matches, Cell above target `(5, 10)` is `8`. Valid condition.
*   Pattern at `(12, 0)`: Matches, Cell above target `(12, 3)` is `1`. **Invalid condition**.

This confirms the "cell above must be 8" rule explains the non-modification at `(12, 3)`. It also confirms that row 5 has two valid candidate modifications based on this rule. The "apply only the rightmost" rule is needed to select `(5, 10)` over `(5, 5)`.


```yaml
Task: Modify grid cells based on a specific local horizontal and vertical pattern context, resolving conflicts by prioritizing the rightmost occurrence in a row.

Objects:
  - Grid: A 2D array of integers.
    Properties:
      - rows: Number of rows.
      - cols: Number of columns.
      - cells: Individual elements within the grid.
  - Cell: An element within the Grid.
    Properties:
      - value: Integer (1, 8, or 4 in output).
      - position: (row_index, column_index).
  - Horizontal Pattern: A specific horizontal sequence of cell values.
    Properties:
      - sequence: [1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1]
      - length: 7
      - target_index: 3 (0-based index relative to the start of the pattern)
  - Vertical Context: The value of the cell directly above the target cell within the pattern.
    Properties:
      - required_value: 8

Actions:
  - Scan Row: Iterate through each row to find potential modification points.
  - Identify Valid Patterns: For each row, find all starting column indices `c` where:
      - The sequence `input_grid[r][c : c+7]` matches the Horizontal Pattern.
      - The target cell position is `(r, c + 3)`.
      - The row index `r` is greater than 0.
      - The cell above the target cell, `input_grid[r-1][c + 3]`, has a value of `8`.
  - Select Rightmost: If multiple valid patterns are found in a single row `r`, select only the one corresponding to the largest starting column index `c`.
  - Copy: Create the output grid initially identical to the input grid.
  - Modify: For the selected valid pattern(s) (at most one per row), change the value of the target cell `(r, c + 3)` in the *output* grid from 8 to 4.

Relationships:
  - A Cell belongs to a Grid at a specific position.
  - A Modification action requires a Valid Pattern to be identified and selected.
  - A Valid Pattern requires both the Horizontal Pattern match and the correct Vertical Context (cell above is 8).
  - The Select Rightmost action resolves conflicts among multiple Valid Patterns within the same row.
  - The target cell for Modification depends on the starting position `c` of the selected Valid Pattern.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid (the output grid) that is an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Initialize a list or dictionary to store the single potential modification column index for each row, if any is found.
3.  Iterate through each row `r` of the input grid, starting from row 1 (the second row, index 1) up to the last row. Row 0 cannot satisfy the 'cell above' condition.
4.  For each row `r`, iterate through each possible horizontal starting position (column index `c`) such that a sequence of 7 cells (from `c` to `c+6`) can be examined within the row boundaries.
5.  At each position `(r, c)`, check if the sequence of cell values `input_grid[r][c : c+7]` exactly matches the pattern `[1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1]`.
6.  If the horizontal pattern matches, identify the target column index `target_c = c + 3`.
7.  Check if the cell directly above the target cell, `input_grid[r-1][target_c]`, has the value `8`.
8.  If both the horizontal pattern matches AND the cell above the target is `8`, then this is a *valid candidate* pattern starting at column `c` for row `r`. Store or update the potential modification column index for row `r` to be `target_c` (associated with starting column `c`). If a previous candidate was stored for row `r`, this new one (starting further right) overwrites it.
9.  After iterating through all possible starting columns `c` for a given row `r`, the stored potential modification column index (if any) represents the one resulting from the rightmost valid pattern found in that row.
10. After iterating through all rows, iterate through the stored potential modification points. For each row `r` that has a stored `target_c`, change the value of the cell at `(r, target_c)` in the *output* grid to `4`.
11. Return the output grid.
