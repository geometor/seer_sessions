Task: Modify grid cells based on a specific local horizontal and vertical pattern context, resolving conflicts by prioritizing the rightmost occurrence in a row.

Objects:
  - Grid: A 2D array of integers.
    Properties:
      - rows: Number of rows.
      - cols: Number of columns.
      - cells: Individual elements within the grid.
  - Cell: An element within the Grid.
    Properties:
      - value: Integer (1, 8, or 4 in output).
      - position: (row_index, column_index).
  - Horizontal Pattern: A specific horizontal sequence of cell values.
    Properties:
      - sequence: [1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1]
      - length: 7
      - target_index: 3 (0-based index relative to the start of the pattern)
  - Vertical Context: The value of the cell directly above the target cell within the pattern.
    Properties:
      - required_value: 8

Actions:
  - Scan Row: Iterate through each row to find potential modification points.
  - Identify Valid Patterns: For each row, find all starting column indices `c` where:
      - The sequence `input_grid[r][c : c+7]` matches the Horizontal Pattern.
      - The target cell position is `(r, c + 3)`.
      - The row index `r` is greater than 0.
      - The cell above the target cell, `input_grid[r-1][c + 3]`, has a value of `8`.
  - Select Rightmost: If multiple valid patterns are found in a single row `r`, select only the one corresponding to the largest starting column index `c`.
  - Copy: Create the output grid initially identical to the input grid.
  - Modify: For the selected valid pattern(s) (at most one per row), change the value of the target cell `(r, c + 3)` in the *output* grid from 8 to 4.

Relationships:
  - A Cell belongs to a Grid at a specific position.
  - A Modification action requires a Valid Pattern to be identified and selected.
  - A Valid Pattern requires both the Horizontal Pattern match and the correct Vertical Context (cell above is 8).
  - The Select Rightmost action resolves conflicts among multiple Valid Patterns within the same row.
  - The target cell for Modification depends on the starting position `c` of the selected Valid Pattern.
