            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and describe the transformation.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids containing integer values. The grids can have varying dimensions.\n2.  **Values:** The grids primarily contain the value `8`. The value `1` appears scattered throughout the grids. The value `4` appears *only* in the output grids, replacing specific `8`s from the input.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation is highly localized. Most cells remain unchanged between input and output. The core change involves identifying specific `8`s in the input grid and changing their value to `4` in the output grid.\n4.  **Pattern Identification:** The change from `8` to `4` seems to depend on the horizontal neighbors of the cell. By comparing the input and output grids, a specific horizontal pattern emerges around the cells that are modified:\n    *   In `train_1`, the `8` at `(5, 4)` changes to `4`. Its horizontal neighbors in the input form the sequence `... 1 1 8 [8] 8 1 1 ...` (cells `(5,1)` to `(5,7)`).\n    *   In `train_2`, the `8` at `(4, 3)` changes to `4`. Its horizontal neighbors in the input form the sequence `... 1 1 8 [8] 8 1 1 ...` (cells `(4,0)` to `(4,6)`).\n    *   In `train_3`, the `8` at `(5, 10)` changes to `4`. Its horizontal neighbors in the input form the sequence `... 1 1 8 [8] 8 1 1 ...` (cells `(5,7)` to `(5,13)`).\n    *   In `train_3`, the `8` at `(11, 12)` changes to `4`. Its horizontal neighbors in the input form the sequence `... 1 1 8 [8] 8 1 1 ...` (cells `(11,9)` to `(11,15)`).\n5.  **Rule Formulation:** The consistent pattern observed is `1 1 8 X 8 1 1` horizontally, where `X` is the cell being considered. If `X` is `8` and it is part of this specific 7-cell horizontal sequence `1 1 8 8 8 1 1`, then its value is changed to `4` in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
