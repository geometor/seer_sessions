Task: Modify grid cells based on a horizontal pattern.

Objects:
  - Grid: A 2D array of integers.
    Properties:
      - rows: Number of rows.
      - cols: Number of columns.
      - cells: Individual elements within the grid.
  - Cell: An element within the Grid.
    Properties:
      - value: Integer (1, 8, or 4 in output).
      - position: (row_index, column_index).
  - Pattern: A specific horizontal sequence of cell values.
    Properties:
      - sequence: [1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1]
      - length: 7
      - target_index: 3 (0-based index of the cell to potentially modify)

Actions:
  - Scan: Iterate through the grid to find occurrences of the Pattern.
  - Compare: Check if a sequence of cells in a row matches the Pattern.
  - Modify: Change the value of a specific cell (the one at target_index within a matched Pattern) from 8 to 4.
  - Copy: Create the output grid initially identical to the input grid.

Relationships:
  - A Cell belongs to a Grid at a specific position.
  - The Modification action is triggered by a successful Compare action.
  - The Scan action iterates through Rows and potential starting columns within each Row.
  - The target cell for Modification is determined by its position relative to the matched Pattern within a Row.
