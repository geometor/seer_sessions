Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) of single-digit integers.
2.  **Grid Sizes:** The input grid size can vary (16x16 in train_1, 15x15 in train_2). The output grid size appears to be consistently 16x16.
3.  **Color Palette:**
    *   Input uses primarily color 7, with sparse occurrences of other colors (6, 8 in train_1; 4, 5 in train_2).
    *   Output uses primarily color 7, with a distinct rectangular pattern composed of colors 2 and 4 appearing in the lower part.
4.  **Background Color:** The number 7 seems to function as a background color in both input and output.
5.  **Foreground Objects (Input):** The non-7 numbers in the input grids represent significant foreground elements.
6.  **Output Pattern:** The output features a rectangular pattern made of 2s and 4s.
    *   Its height is consistently 5 rows.
    *   Its width varies (10 in train_1, 7 in train_2).
    *   Its position in the output grid is fixed: the top-left corner of the pattern is always at row 11, column 0.
    *   The rest of the output grid (outside this pattern) is filled with the background color 7.
7.  **Transformation Core Logic:** The transformation appears to involve:
    *   Identifying the non-background elements in the input.
    *   Calculating some property based on these elements (likely their bounding box).
    *   Using this property to select a specific, predefined 5xN pattern (composed of 2s and 4s).
    *   Placing this selected pattern at a fixed location (11, 0) onto a 16x16 background grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Define the background color as 7.
2.  Create a new 16x16 grid, `output_grid`, and initialize all its cells with the background color (7).
3.  Scan the `input_grid` to find the row and column coordinates of all cells containing a value different from the background color (7). Store these coordinates.
4.  If no such cells exist, return the initialized `output_grid`.
5.  Calculate the minimum row (`min_r`), maximum row (`max_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), and maximum column (`max_c`) from the stored coordinates.
6.  Determine the height `H = max_r - min_r + 1` and width `W = max_c - min_c + 1` of the bounding box enclosing these non-background cells.
7.  Based on the calculated `H` and `W`, select a specific predefined output pattern (a 5-row high grid of 2s and 4s). The width of the pattern depends on the `H` and `W` values (e.g., H=16, W=14 yields a 5x10 pattern; H=12, W=14 yields a 5x7 pattern).
8.  Define the target top-left anchor position in the `output_grid` as row 11, column 0.
9.  Copy the selected pattern's values into the `output_grid`, starting from the anchor position, overwriting the background color values within the pattern's boundaries.
10. Return the `output_grid`.
