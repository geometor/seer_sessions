task_elements:
  - object: Input Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - variable_size: true (e.g., 16x16, 15x15)
      - contains: background color, foreground colors
  - object: Output Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - fixed_size: 16x16 (observed)
      - contains: background color, output pattern colors (2, 4)
  - object: Background Color
    properties:
      - value: 7 (observed)
      - role: fills most of input/output, default state
  - object: Foreground Cells (Input)
    properties:
      - value: any integer != Background Color (e.g., 4, 5, 6, 8)
      - role: determine the transformation outcome
      - located_at: specific (row, column) coordinates
  - object: Bounding Box (Input Foreground)
    properties:
      - defines: smallest rectangle enclosing all Foreground Cells
      - dimensions: Height (H), Width (W)
      - role: primary determinant for selecting the Output Pattern
  - object: Output Pattern
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (predefined shape)
      - composed_of: colors 2 and 4
      - fixed_height: 5 (observed)
      - variable_width: N (observed, e.g., 10, 7)
      - selection_criteria: depends on Bounding Box dimensions (H, W)
  - object: Pattern Location (Output)
    properties:
      - position: fixed top-left corner for the Output Pattern
      - coordinates: row=11, column=0 (observed)

relationships:
  - type: Derivation
    subject: Bounding Box (H, W)
    verb: is derived from
    object: coordinates of all Foreground Cells in Input Grid
  - type: Selection
    subject: Output Pattern (specific shape and width N)
    verb: is selected based on
    object: Bounding Box dimensions (H, W)
    details:
      - If H=16, W=14 -> Pattern1 (5x10)
      - If H=12, W=14 -> Pattern2 (5x7)
      - General mapping rule TBD
  - type: Placement
    subject: Selected Output Pattern
    verb: is placed onto
    object: Output Grid
    details:
      - at fixed coordinates (row=11, col=0)
      - overwrites existing background color

actions:
  - name: Initialize Output
    steps: Create a 16x16 grid filled with Background Color (7).
  - name: Identify Foreground
    steps: Find all cells in Input Grid not equal to Background Color.
  - name: Calculate Bounding Box
    steps: Determine min/max row/col of identified Foreground Cells to get H and W.
  - name: Select Pattern
    steps: Use H and W to choose the correct predefined 5xN pattern.
  - name: Apply Pattern
    steps: Copy the selected pattern onto the initialized Output Grid at the fixed Pattern Location.
  - name: Finalize
    steps: Return the modified Output Grid.
