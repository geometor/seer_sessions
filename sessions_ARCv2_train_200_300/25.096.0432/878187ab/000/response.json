The output grid size appears to be consistently 16x16.\n3.  **Color Palette:**\n    *   Input uses primarily color 7, with sparse occurrences of other colors (6, 8 in train_1; 4, 5 in train_2).\n    *   Output uses primarily color 7, with a distinct rectangular pattern composed of colors 2 and 4 appearing in the lower part.\n4.  **Background Color:** The number 7 seems to function as a background color in both input and output.\n5.  **Foreground Objects (Input):** The non-7 numbers in the input grids represent significant foreground elements.\n6.  **Output Pattern:** The output features a rectangular pattern made of 2s and 4s.\n    *   Its height is consistently 5 rows.\n    *   Its width varies (10 in train_1, 7 in train_2).\n    *   Its position in the output grid is fixed: the top-left corner of the pattern is always at row 11, column 0.\n    *   The rest of the output grid (outside this pattern) is filled with the background color 7.\n7.  **Transformation Core Logic:** The transformation appears to involve:\n    *   Identifying the non-background elements in the input.\n    *   Calculating some property based on these elements (likely their bounding box).\n    *   Using this property to select a specific, predefined 5xN pattern (composed of 2s and 4s).\n    *   Placing this selected pattern at a fixed location (11, 0) onto a 16x16 background grid.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"

Create a new 16x16 grid, `output_grid`, and initialize all its cells with the background color (7).\n3.  Scan the `input_grid` to find the row and column coordinates of all cells containing a value different from the background color (7). Store these coordinates.\n4.  If no such cells exist, return the initialized `output_grid`.\n5.  Calculate the minimum row (`min_r`), maximum row (`max_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), and maximum column (`max_c`) from the stored coordinates.\n6.  Determine the height `H = max_r - min_r + 1` and width `W = max_c - min_c + 1` of the bounding box enclosing these non-background cells.\n7.  Based on the calculated `H` and `W`, select a specific predefined output pattern (a 5-row high grid of 2s and 4s). The width of the pattern depends on the `H` and `W` values (e.g., H=16, W=14 yields a 5x10 pattern; H=12, W=14 yields a 5x7 pattern).\n8.  Define the target top-left anchor position in the `output_grid` as row 11, column 0.\n9.  Copy the selected pattern's values into the `output_grid`, starting from the anchor position, overwriting the background color values within the pattern's boundaries.\n10. Return the `output_grid`."
