  - type: grid
  - element_type: integer
objects:
  - name: blob
    definition: A connected region of non-zero cells in the input grid.
    connectivity: Assumed 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right neighbours).
    properties:
      - size: The count of non-zero cells in the blob.
      - bounding_box: The minimum rectangle (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col) enclosing the blob.
relationships:
  - type: selection
    subject: blob
    criteria: The blob with the maximum size (largest count of non-zero cells).
actions:
  - name: identify_blobs
    description: Find all distinct connected regions of non-zero cells in the input grid.
  - name: calculate_blob_size
    description: Count the number of non-zero cells for each identified blob.
  - name: find_largest_blob
    description: Select the blob with the highest cell count. Resolve ties arbitrarily if necessary (though not observed in examples).
  - name: determine_bounding_box
    description: Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices for the selected largest blob.
  - name: extract_subgrid
    description: Create the output grid by copying the portion of the input grid defined by the bounding box of the largest blob.
