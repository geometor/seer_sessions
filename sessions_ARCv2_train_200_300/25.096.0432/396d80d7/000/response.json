The grids appear to be of fixed size (16x16 in these examples).\n2.  **Colors/Digits:** The grids use a limited set of digits. There's a dominant background digit (7).\n3.  **Input Pattern:** Each input grid contains a distinct pattern embedded within the background digit. This pattern is composed of two other digits (6 and 2 in train\\_1; 4 and 1 in train\\_2).\n4.  **Output Pattern:** The output grid retains the original input pattern. Additionally, some background cells adjacent to the original pattern are changed to a new digit.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying specific background cells based on their proximity to certain parts of the input pattern and changing their value.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
