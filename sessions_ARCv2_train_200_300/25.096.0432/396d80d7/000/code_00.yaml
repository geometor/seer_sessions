task_description: "Modify background cells adjacent to a specific part of an embedded pattern."
grid_properties:
  type: 2D array of integers
  size: 16x16 (observed)
  background_color: 7 (observed)
objects:
  - object: grid
    description: "The main data structure, containing cells."
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer digit
      - position: (row, column)
  - object: pattern
    description: "A configuration of non-background cells within the grid."
    properties:
      - colors: set of integer digits (e.g., {6, 2} or {4, 1})
      - location: central area of the grid (observed)
relationships:
  - type: adjacency (Moore neighborhood)
    description: "Cells are considered adjacent if they touch horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (8 neighbors)."
actions:
  - action: identify_colors
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [background_color, pattern_colors]
    description: "Find the most frequent color (background) and other colors (pattern)."
  - action: determine_trigger_and_fill
    inputs: [pattern_colors]
    outputs: [trigger_color, fill_color]
    description: "From the pattern colors, identify the color that triggers the change (trigger_color, seems to be the max pattern color) and the color used for filling (fill_color, seems to be the min pattern color)."
  - action: modify_cells
    inputs: [input_grid, background_color, trigger_color, fill_color]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    description: "Iterate through input grid cells. If a cell has the background color AND is adjacent to a cell with the trigger_color, change its value to the fill_color in the output grid. Otherwise, copy the input cell value to the output grid."
