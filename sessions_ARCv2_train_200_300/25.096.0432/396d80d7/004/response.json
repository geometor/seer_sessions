            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code correctly identified the background color, pattern colors, trigger color (max of pattern), and fill color (min of pattern). It also correctly identified the general action: change background cells adjacent to the trigger color to the fill color.\n\nHowever, the comparison between the expected output and the transformed output reveals that the transformation is too broad. In both failed examples, the code changes background cells adjacent to the trigger color even when those cells are *also* adjacent to the fill color in the original input grid. The expected output indicates that a background cell should only be changed if it is adjacent to the trigger color *and* **not** adjacent to the fill color in the input grid.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the condition for changing a background cell's color. Instead of just checking for adjacency to the trigger color, the rule must include an additional check to ensure the cell is *not* adjacent to the fill color.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
