task_description: "Modify background cells adjacent to the pattern's trigger color but not adjacent to the pattern's fill color."
grid_properties:
  type: 2D array of integers
  size: 16x16 (observed)
  background_color: Most frequent integer in the grid.
objects:
  - object: grid
    description: "The main 2D data structure containing cells."
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer digit (color)
      - position: (row, column)
  - object: pattern
    description: "A configuration of non-background cells."
    properties:
      - colors: Set of integer digits excluding the background color.
      - trigger_color: The maximum value within the pattern colors.
      - fill_color: The minimum value within the pattern colors.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency (Moore neighborhood)
    description: "Cells are adjacent if they touch horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (8 neighbors)."
  - type: color_adjacency
    description: "Whether a cell is adjacent to another cell of a specific color."
    properties:
      - source_cell: cell
      - target_color: integer digit
      - is_adjacent: boolean
actions:
  - action: identify_colors
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [background_color, pattern_colors, trigger_color, fill_color]
    description: "Find the background color (most frequent), pattern colors (all others), trigger color (max pattern color), and fill color (min pattern color)."
  - action: determine_neighbor_colors
    inputs: [grid, cell_position]
    outputs: [set_of_neighbor_colors]
    description: "Find the unique colors of the 8 neighbors of a given cell."
  - action: modify_cell
    inputs: [input_grid_cell, background_color, trigger_color, fill_color, neighbor_colors]
    outputs: [output_grid_cell_value]
    description: >
      If the input cell's color is the background_color AND
      the trigger_color is present in the neighbor_colors AND
      the fill_color is NOT present in the neighbor_colors,
      set the output cell's value to fill_color.
      Otherwise, keep the input cell's value.
  - action: generate_output_grid
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    description: "Create an output grid by applying the modify_cell action to each cell based on its properties and neighbors in the input grid."
