task_description: "Modify background cells based on adjacency to pattern elements."
grid_properties:
  type: 2D array of integers
  size: Variable (observed 16x16)
  background_color: Most frequent color in the input grid.
objects:
  - object: grid
    description: "The 2D data structure containing cells."
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer digit (color)
      - position: (row, column)
  - object: pattern
    description: "A configuration of non-background cells."
    properties:
      - colors: set of integer digits distinct from the background color.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency (Moore neighborhood)
    description: "Cells are adjacent if they share an edge or corner (8 neighbors)."
actions:
  - action: identify_colors
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [background_color, pattern_colors]
    description: "Find the most frequent color (background) and all other colors (pattern)."
  - action: determine_trigger_and_fill
    inputs: [pattern_colors]
    outputs: [trigger_color, fill_color]
    description: "Identify the trigger color (maximum value in pattern_colors) and the fill color (minimum value in pattern_colors)."
  - action: modify_cells
    inputs: [input_grid, background_color, trigger_color, fill_color]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    description: >
      Create a copy of the input grid as the output grid.
      Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the input grid.
      If the input cell (r, c) contains the background_color:
        Check its 8 neighbors in the *input* grid.
        Determine if any neighbor has the trigger_color.
        Determine if any neighbor has the fill_color.
        If a neighbor has the trigger_color AND no neighbor has the fill_color:
          Set the output cell (r, c) to the fill_color.
      Otherwise, the output cell (r, c) retains its value from the input grid.
