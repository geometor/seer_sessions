Task: Fill specific columns downwards with color 8, based on header pattern and proximity to color 2.

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Colors: {0: Background, 8: Header/Fill, 2: Trigger}
  Structure:
    - Top Block: Contiguous block of identical rows starting from row 0, containing pattern of 8s.
    - Trigger Cells: Cells with value 2, located below the Top Block.
    - Background Cells: Cells with value 0.

Output:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Same dimensions as input.
    - Preserves original non-zero input cells (8s and 2s).
    - Contains additional 8s filling specific columns below the Top Block.

Transformation:
  Identify Objects:
    - Header Block: Rows 0 to 'last_top_row'.
    - Header 8 Columns ('Header8Cols'): Set of column indices containing 8 within the Header Block.
    - Trigger Columns ('TwoCols'): Set of column indices containing 2 anywhere in the grid.
  Identify Relationships:
    - Neighbour Columns ('NeighboursOfTwoCols'): Set of column indices adjacent (left/right) to any column in 'TwoCols'. Handle grid boundaries.
  Derive Action Targets:
    - Neighbour Columns to Fill ('NeighboursToFill'): Columns in 'NeighboursOfTwoCols' that are NOT in 'TwoCols'. (Set difference: NeighboursOfTwoCols - TwoCols).
    - Final Target Columns ('TargetFillCols'): Columns in 'Header8Cols' OR columns in 'NeighboursToFill'. (Set union: Header8Cols | NeighboursToFill).
  Action:
    - Create Output Grid: Copy input grid.
    - Determine Fill Start Row: `fill_start_row = last_top_row + 1`.
    - Fill Downwards:
        For each column index 'c' in 'TargetFillCols':
          For each row index 'r' from 'fill_start_row' to the last row:
            If the cell output_grid[r][c] is 0:
              Set output_grid[r][c] to 8.
