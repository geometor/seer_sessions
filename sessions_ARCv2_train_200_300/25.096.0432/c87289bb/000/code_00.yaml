Task: Fill columns downwards with a specific color based on header pattern.

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Contains integers representing colors (0, 2, 8).
    - Has a distinct top block of rows with a repeating pattern, primarily featuring the color 8.
    - Contains a small cluster of color 2 somewhere below the top block.
    - Color 0 acts as a background.

Output:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Same dimensions as the input grid.
    - Preserves all elements (0, 2, 8) from the input grid.
    - Contains additional elements of color 8.

Transformation:
  Action: Add color 8 elements to the grid.
  Rule:
    1. Identify the top block of identical rows starting from row 0. Let the last row index of this block be 'last_top_row'.
    2. Identify all column indices that contain the color 8 within this top block (rows 0 to 'last_top_row'). Let this set be 'target_columns'.
    3. Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
    4. For each column index 'c' in 'target_columns':
       Iterate through rows from 'last_top_row + 1' down to the last row of the grid.
       Set the value of the cell at (row, c) in the output grid to 8.
  Relationships:
    - The locations of the new 8s depend directly on the column positions of the 8s in the initial top block of the input grid.
    - The vertical extension of the new 8s starts immediately below the identified top block.
    - Original non-zero elements (8s and 2s) in the input are preserved in the output.
