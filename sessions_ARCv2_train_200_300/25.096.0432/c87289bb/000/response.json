These lines are located in columns that contained 8s within the initial top block of the input grid. The new vertical lines start from the row immediately following the top block and extend downwards to the bottom of the grid. Existing 0s in these columns (below the top block) are replaced by 8s, while existing 2s or original 8s remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the top block of identical rows starting from row 0. Let the last row index of this block be 'last_top_row'.\n    2. Identify all column indices that contain the color 8 within this top block (rows 0 to 'last_top_row'). Let this set be 'target_columns'.\n    3. Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n    4. For each column index 'c' in 'target_columns':\n       Iterate through rows from 'last_top_row + 1' down to the last row of the grid.\n       Set the value of the cell at (row, c) in the output grid to 8.\n  Relationships:\n    - The locations of the new 8s depend directly on the column positions of the 8s in the initial top block of the input grid.\n    - The vertical extension of the new 8s starts immediately below the identified top block.\n    - Original non-zero elements (8s and 2s) in the input are preserved in the output.\n```"

The last row of the top block (`last_top_row`) is `first_different_row_index - 1`. (If all rows are identical, handle this edge case, though it doesn't appear in examples).\n3.
