*   **Perception of the Elements:**
    *   The input is a 2D grid containing primarily zeros (0) and exactly two instances of the number eight (8).
    *   The output is also a 2D grid.
    *   The original positions of the eights (8) are preserved in the output grid.
    *   The output grid introduces the number three (3).
    *   The threes (3) form a hollow rectangle connecting the positions of the two eights (8). The eights themselves lie on the perimeter of this rectangle. The rectangle is defined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the two eights.

*   **YAML Facts:**

    transformation:
      action: Identify the coordinates of the two '8' cells.
      action: Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices from these coordinates to define a bounding box.
      action: Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
      action: Fill the cells along the perimeter of the bounding box with the value '3', excluding the cells that originally contained '8'.
        - Specifically, fill cells (r, c) with '3' if:
          - (r == min_row OR r == max_row) AND (min_col <= c <= max_col) OR
          - (c == min_col OR c == max_col) AND (min_row <= r <= max_row)
          - AND the cell at (r, c) in the input grid was '0'.
    relationship:
      - The '3' cells form the perimeter of the smallest rectangle enclosing the two '8' cells.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Start with the input grid.
    2.  Identify the row and column coordinates of the two cells containing the value 8. Let these be (r1, c1) and (r2, c2).
    3.  Determine the minimum row (`min_r`), maximum row (`max_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), and maximum column (`max_c`) from these two coordinates.
    4.  Create an output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
    5.  Iterate through all cells (r, c) within the bounding box defined by `min_r`, `max_r`, `min_c`, `max_c`.
    6.  For each cell (r, c), check if it lies on the perimeter of the bounding box (i.e., if `r == min_r` or `r == max_r` or `c == min_c` or `c == max_c`).
    7.  If the cell (r, c) is on the perimeter AND its value in the *input* grid is 0, change its value in the *output* grid to 3.
    8.  Return the modified output grid.
