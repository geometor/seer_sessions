Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input is a 2D grid containing integers. Visually, it appears segmented into distinct regions. There's a background color (0), an upper "pattern" region, and a lower "fill" region.
2.  **Upper Pattern Region:** This region contains a mix of digits, primarily 0s, 8s, and one other non-zero digit (2 in train\_1, 3 in train\_2, 4 in train\_3). The non-zero elements define a specific shape or pattern within a bounding box.
3.  **Lower Fill Region:** This region consists of a large rectangular block of a single non-zero digit (1 in train\_1, 3 in train\_2, 4 in train\_3), surrounded by the background color (0). This digit seems to define the "fill color" for the output.
4.  **Output Structure:** The output is also a 2D grid, but generally smaller than the input. Its dimensions correspond to the bounding box of the non-zero elements in the *upper* pattern region of the input.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to involve extracting the pattern from the upper region of the input, determining a "fill color" from the lower region, and then redrawing the pattern using this fill color while preserving the location of the '8' digits. The specific non-8 digit used in the input pattern (2, 3, or 4) seems irrelevant for the output pixel values, only its location matters.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Fill Digit:** Scan the input grid, typically from bottom to top, to locate a large rectangular region composed of a single, repeated non-zero digit (e.g., 1, 3, or 4). Store this digit as the `fill_digit`.
2.  **Locate the Pattern Region:** Identify the region in the upper part of the grid containing non-zero digits, specifically including the digit 8 and potentially one other non-zero digit (like 2, 3, or 4).
3.  **Determine Pattern Bounding Box:** Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices that encompass all non-zero cells within this identified pattern region.
4.  **Extract and Transform Pattern:** Create a new output grid whose dimensions match the calculated bounding box ( (max\_row - min\_row + 1) x (max\_col - min\_col + 1) ).
5.  Iterate through each cell (row `r`, column `c`) within the bounding box of the input grid (from `min_row` to `max_row`, `min_col` to `max_col`):
    *   Get the value `v` from the input grid at `input[r][c]`.
    *   Determine the corresponding output coordinates: `out_r = r - min_row`, `out_c = c - min_col`.
    *   If `v` is 8, set the output grid cell `output[out_r][out_c]` to 8.
    *   If `v` is non-zero and not 8, set the output grid cell `output[out_r][out_c]` to the `fill_digit` identified in Step 1.
6.  **Finalize:** The resulting grid is the final output.
