task_description: "Extract a pattern from the upper part of the input grid, determine a fill color from the lower part, and redraw the pattern using the fill color, preserving the locations of '8's."

elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - contains_background: digit 0
      - contains_pattern_region: upper area with mixed non-zero digits (including 8)
      - contains_fill_region: lower area with a large block of a single non-zero digit
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: corresponds to the bounding box of the input pattern region
      - contains_transformed_pattern: uses fill color and preserves 8s

relations:
  - type: defines
    subject: input_grid.fill_region
    object: output_grid.fill_color
    details: "The single dominant non-zero digit in the lower region determines the primary color used in the output, replacing non-8 pattern digits."
  - type: extracts_and_transforms
    subject: input_grid.pattern_region
    object: output_grid
    details: "The shape defined by non-zero elements in the upper region is extracted. Cells with '8' retain their value. Other non-zero cells are replaced by the fill_color."
  - type: determines_size
    subject: input_grid.pattern_region.bounding_box
    object: output_grid.dimensions
    details: "The min/max rows and columns containing non-zero elements in the pattern region define the output grid size."

    description: "Create the output grid by iterating through the pattern subgrid. If a cell is 8, copy 8. If a cell is non-zero and not 8, copy the fill_digit."
