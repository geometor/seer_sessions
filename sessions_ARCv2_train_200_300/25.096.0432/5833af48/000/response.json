Visually, it appears segmented into distinct regions. There's a background color (0), an upper \"pattern\" region, and a lower \"fill\" region.\n2.  **Upper Pattern Region:** This region contains a mix of digits, primarily 0s, 8s, and one other non-zero digit (2 in train\\_1, 3 in train\\_2, 4 in train\\_3). The non-zero elements define a specific shape or pattern within a bounding box.\n3.  **Lower Fill Region:** This region consists of a large rectangular block of a single non-zero digit (1 in train\\_1, 3 in train\\_2, 4 in train\\_3), surrounded by the background color (0). This digit seems to define the \"fill color\" for the output.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output is also a 2D grid, but generally smaller than the input. Its dimensions correspond to the bounding box of the non-zero elements in the *upper* pattern region of the input.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to involve extracting the pattern from the upper region of the input, determining a \"fill color\" from the lower region, and then redrawing the pattern using this fill color while preserving the location of the '8' digits. The specific non-8 digit used in the input pattern (2, 3, or 4) seems irrelevant for the output pixel values, only its location matters.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Store this digit as the `fill_digit`.\n2.  **Locate the Pattern Region:** Identify the region in the upper part of the grid containing non-zero digits, specifically including the digit 8 and potentially one other non-zero digit (like 2, 3, or 4).\n3.  **Determine Pattern Bounding Box:** Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices that encompass all non-zero cells within this identified pattern region.\n4.  **Extract and Transform Pattern:** Create a new output grid whose dimensions match the calculated bounding box ( (max\\_row - min\\_row + 1) x (max\\_col - min\\_col + 1) ).\n5.  Iterate through each cell (row `r`, column `c`) within the bounding box of the input grid (from `min_row` to `max_row`, `min_col` to `max_col`):\n    *   Get the value `v` from the input grid at `input[r][c]`.\n    *   Determine the corresponding output coordinates: `out_r = r - min_row`, `out_c = c - min_col`.\n    *   If `v` is 8, set the output grid cell `output[out_r][out_c]` to 8.\n    *   If `v` is non-zero and not 8, set the output grid cell `output[out_r][out_c]` to the `fill_digit` identified in Step 1.\n6.  **Finalize:** The resulting grid is the final output."
