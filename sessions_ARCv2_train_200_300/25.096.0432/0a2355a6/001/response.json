For each component, count the number of 0s fully surrounded by it (cannot reach the grid boundary without crossing the component). Replace the 8s of that component with this count. Keep original 0s as 0s.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_component(start_r, start_c, grid, visited, rows, cols):\n    \"\"\"Finds all connected '8' cells using BFS (8-connectivity).\"\"\"\n    if visited[start_r, start_c] or grid[start_r, start_c] != 8:\n        return set()\n\n    component_coords = set()\n    queue = deque([(start_r, start_c)])\n    visited[start_r, start_c] = True\n\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        component_coords.add((r, c))\n\n        # Check 8 neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                    continue # Skip self\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n\n                # Check bounds and if neighbor is an unvisited '8'\n                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                   grid[nr, nc] == 8 and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                    visited[nr, nc] = True\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    return component_coords\n\ndef count_enclosed_zeros(component_coords, grid, rows, cols):\n    \"\"\"Counts '0' cells enclosed by the component using flood fill from the boundary.\"\"\"\n    # Create a temporary grid where component cells are barriers (1)\n    # and other cells (including original 0s and other 8s) are passable (0).\n    temp_grid = np.zeros_like(grid)\n    component_set = set(component_coords)\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if (r, c) in component_set:\n                temp_grid[r, c] = 1 # Mark component cells as barriers\n\n    # Initialize reachable grid and queue for BFS (flood fill from outside)\n    reachable = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Add all boundary cells that are NOT part of the component barrier to the queue\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in [0, cols - 1]: # Left and Right edges\n            if temp_grid[r, c] == 0 and not reachable[r, c]:\n                reachable[r, c] = True\n                queue.append((r, c))\n    for c in range(1, cols - 1): # Top and Bottom edges (avoid corners again)\n        for r in [0, rows - 1]:\n             if temp_grid[r, c] == 0 and not reachable[r, c]:\n                reachable[r, c] = True\n                queue.append((r, c))\n\n    # Perform BFS using 4-connectivity for reachability of '0' spaces\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]: # 4 directions\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            # Check bounds, if passable (not component barrier), and not already reached\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n               temp_grid[nr, nc] == 0 and not reachable[nr, nc]:\n                reachable[nr, nc] = True\n                queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    # Count original '0' cells that are not reachable from the outside\n    enclosed_count = 0\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Must be originally '0' and not reachable from boundary\n            if grid[r, c] == 0 and not reachable[r, c]:\n                 enclosed_count += 1\n\n    return enclosed_count\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the grid by replacing connected components of 8s with the count\n    of 0s they enclose.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    rows, cols = grid_np.shape\n\n    # Initialize output grid with zeros\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(grid_np)\n    # Keep track of visited '8' cells to avoid processing components multiple times\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid_np, dtype=bool)\n\n    # Iterate through each cell of the grid\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # If we find an '8' that hasn't been visited yet, it's the start of a new component\n            if grid_np[r, c] == 8 and not visited[r, c]:\n                # 1.
