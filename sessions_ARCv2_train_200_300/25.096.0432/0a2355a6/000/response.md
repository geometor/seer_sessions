*   **Perception:** The input is a 2D grid containing digits 0 and 8. The output is a 2D grid of the same dimensions, containing digits 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. The digit 8 in the input seems to form distinct shapes or components. These components of 8s are replaced by other digits (1-4) in the output grid, while the 0s generally remain 0s. The key transformation appears to involve identifying these connected components of 8s and assigning a new digit to each component based on some property.

*   **Analysis:** By comparing input and output grids across the examples, we can observe the following:
    *   Connected components of '8' cells (sharing an edge or corner - 8-connectivity seems implied by the shapes) in the input are treated as single units.
    *   Each distinct component of '8's in the input is replaced by a *single*, uniform digit in the output.
    *   The background '0's from the input remain '0's in the output, *unless* they are fully enclosed within a component of 8s.
    *   The digit assigned to replace a component (1, 2, 3, or 4) appears to correspond to the number of '0' cells that are topologically enclosed within that component's boundary.
    *   For instance, in `train_1`, the top-right component encloses one '0' and becomes '1's. The bottom-right component encloses three '0's and becomes '3's. This pattern holds for all examples.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    Task: Color connected components based on enclosed area count.

    Objects:
      - Grid: A 2D array of cells.
        - Properties: dimensions (rows, cols), cells.
      - Cell: An element within the Grid.
        - Properties: value (digit), position (row, col).
      - Component: A connected group of cells with value 8.
        - Properties: set of cell positions, connectivity (adjacent/diagonal), boundary, enclosed_cells.
      - Enclosed Cell: A cell with value 0 surrounded by a Component.
        - Properties: position.

    Relationships:
      - Cells are part of a Grid.
      - Cells with value 8 can belong to a Component.
      - Cells are connected if they are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (8-connectivity).
      - A Component can enclose Cells with value 0.

    Input Properties:
      - Contains cells with values 0 and 8.
      - Cells with value 8 form one or more connected Components.

    Output Properties:
      - Same dimensions as input Grid.
      - Cells originally 0 remain 0.
      - Cells originally 8 are replaced by a digit N (1 to 4).
      - All cells belonging to the same input Component are replaced by the same digit N.
      - The digit N corresponds to the count of 0-valued cells fully enclosed by that specific Component in the input grid.

    Transformation:
      - Identify connected components of cells with value 8 in the input grid.
      - For each identified component:
        - Determine the set of cells with value 0 that are fully enclosed by this component. Treat the grid edges as non-enclosing boundaries.
        - Count the number of these enclosed 0-cells (let the count be N).
        - Create the output grid, initially a copy of the input or filled with 0s.
        - Replace the value of all cells belonging to the current component with the calculated count N in the output grid.
      - Ensure background 0s from the input remain 0s in the output.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros.
    2.  Create a 'visited' grid of the same dimensions, initialized to false, to keep track of processed '8' cells.
    3.  Iterate through each cell (row `r`, column `c`) of the input grid.
    4.  If the cell at (`r`, `c`) contains an '8' and has not been visited:
        a.  Start a search (e.g., Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) from this cell to find all connected '8' cells (using 8-connectivity: horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors). Mark each found '8' cell as visited. Store the coordinates of all cells belonging to this component.
        b.  Identify all '0' cells that are candidates for being enclosed. A simple approach is to consider all '0' cells within the bounding box of the component, or potentially all '0's in the grid.
        c.  For each candidate '0' cell, determine if it is fully enclosed by the current component. This can be done by checking if a path from this '0' cell to the grid boundary exists without crossing any '8' cell of the *current* component. A flood fill starting from the '0' cell, restricted from entering cells of the current component, can check if it reaches the boundary. If it cannot reach the boundary, it is enclosed.
        d.  Count the number of such enclosed '0' cells (let the count be `N`).
        e.  Iterate through all the cell coordinates previously stored for this component and set the value of the corresponding cells in the output grid to `N`.
    5.  After iterating through all cells in the input grid, return the completed output grid.
