"""
Identifies connected components of '8' cells (using 8-way connectivity) in the input grid.
For each component, it counts the number of '0' cells that are topologically enclosed by that component.
The output grid replaces all cells of a component with the count of its enclosed '0' cells.
'0' cells in the input remain '0' in the output unless they are enclosed. 
However, the standard interpretation is that only the '8's are replaced, and background '0's remain '0'. 
The examples show that enclosed '0's are NOT filled.
The transformation rule is: Find connected components of 8s. For each component, count the number of 0s fully surrounded by it (cannot reach the grid boundary without crossing the component). Replace the 8s of that component with this count. Keep original 0s as 0s.
