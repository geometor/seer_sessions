*   **Perception:**
    *   The task involves transforming a 2D grid of digits.
    *   Each input grid contains a background of zeros and a single connected shape made of a non-zero digit (e.g., 8, 6, 3, 2).
    *   The output grid is the same size as the input grid and also contains a background of zeros.
    *   The non-zero shape from the input grid appears in the output grid, preserving its internal structure and the digit it's made of.
    *   The key transformation is the positional shift of the non-zero shape.
    *   By comparing the input and output positions, the shape consistently shifts horizontally to the left.
    *   The amount of the leftward shift appears to be determined by the initial horizontal position of the shape's leftmost point. Specifically, the shape is moved so that its leftmost point aligns with the first column (column index 0) of the grid.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    Objects:
      - Grid:
          Properties:
            - dimensions: (rows, columns)
            - cells: collection of (row, column, value) tuples
            - background_value: 0
      - Shape:
          Properties:
            - cells: list of (row, column) coordinates with non-zero values
            - color: the non-zero digit value
            - leftmost_column: the minimum column index among all shape cells
    Actions:
      - Identify Shape: Find all connected non-zero cells in the input Grid.
      - Determine Shift: Calculate the horizontal shift required to move the Shape's leftmost_column to column 0. Shift amount = -leftmost_column.
      - Apply Shift: Create a new Grid by moving each cell of the input Shape horizontally by the calculated shift amount.
    Relationships:
      - The output Grid contains the input Shape, shifted horizontally.
      - The shift amount ensures the Shape's leftmost point is at column index 0 in the output Grid.
      - The relative positions of cells within the Shape remain unchanged.
      - The background of the output Grid is filled with the background_value (0).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all cells in the input grid that contain a non-zero value. These cells constitute the 'Shape'. Note the color (the non-zero digit) of the Shape.
    2.  Find the minimum column index among all the cells identified in step 1. Call this `min_col`.
    3.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initializing all cells to zero.
    4.  For each cell at `(row, col)` in the input grid that belongs to the Shape (i.e., has a non-zero value):
        a.  Calculate the new column index: `new_col = col - min_col`.
        b.  Place the Shape's color at the corresponding position `(row, new_col)` in the output grid.
    5.  The resulting grid is the final output.
