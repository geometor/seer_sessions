task_type: grid_transformation
input_features:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (colors)
  - background_color: dominant color in the input grid
  - objects:
      - definition: connected components of non-background colors
      - properties:
          - primary_color: the main color of the component
          - internal_pixels: may contain pixels of other colors
          - bounding_box: the smallest rectangle enclosing the object
          - location: position within the input grid
input_object_count: typically 3 or 4 distinct primary objects per input
output_features:
  - grid: smaller 2D array of integers
relationships:
  - output grid is constructed from selected input objects
  - specific input objects are assigned roles (e.g., Frame, HorizontalEdge, VerticalEdge, Center)
actions:
  - identify_background_color
  - find_connected_components (objects)
  - select_key_objects (typically 3-4)
  - assign_roles_to_objects (based on input properties/position - specific rule TBD)
  - apply_transformations:
      - Frame Object: Identity (no change)
      - HorizontalEdge Object: Mirror Horizontally
      - VerticalEdge Object: Mirror Vertically
      - Center Object: Rotate 180 degrees (or Identity)
  - assemble_output:
      - determine output grid size based on Frame/composite structure
      - place transformed objects onto the output grid in a specific layered order (Frame -> H-Edge -> V-Edge -> Center)
  - fill_background: use input background color for remaining empty cells within the composite shape boundary
