Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** The task takes a grid of numbers (colors) as input and produces a smaller grid of numbers as output.
2.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids. The output grid size varies between examples (7x7, 7x7, 11x11) and is smaller than the input grid (18x18, 13x17, 18x18).
3.  **Colors:** The grids use integer values representing colors. There's a dominant background color in each input (8, 4, 3).
4.  **Objects/Shapes:** The non-background colors in the input form distinct connected shapes or patterns. Some shapes might contain pixels of different colors within their bounds (e.g., the '0' inside the '1' shape in `train_1`, the '8's inside the '2' shape and the '6' inside the '7' shape in `train_3`).
5.  **Composition:** The output grid appears to be a composite structure formed by selecting, transforming, and arranging several shapes from the input.
6.  **Transformations:** The shapes extracted from the input undergo spatial transformations before being placed in the output grid. These transformations include horizontal mirroring, vertical mirroring, and 180-degree rotation (or identity).
7.  **Assembly:** There seems to be a consistent pattern of assembly: one shape acts as a base or frame, defining the output size and outer structure. Other shapes are mirrored horizontally and vertically and placed along the edges or within this frame. A potential fourth shape might be rotated or kept as is and placed in the center, possibly overwriting parts of other shapes.
8.  **Background Filling:** The remaining empty spaces within the composite shape in the output grid are filled with the background color identified from the input grid.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
input_features:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (colors)
  - background_color: dominant color in the input grid
  - objects:
      - definition: connected components of non-background colors
      - properties:
          - primary_color: the main color of the component
          - internal_pixels: may contain pixels of other colors
          - bounding_box: the smallest rectangle enclosing the object
          - location: position within the input grid
input_object_count: typically 3 or 4 distinct primary objects per input
output_features:
  - grid: smaller 2D array of integers
relationships:
  - output grid is constructed from selected input objects
  - specific input objects are assigned roles (e.g., Frame, HorizontalEdge, VerticalEdge, Center)
actions:
  - identify_background_color
  - find_connected_components (objects)
  - select_key_objects (typically 3-4)
  - assign_roles_to_objects (based on input properties/position - specific rule TBD)
  - apply_transformations:
      - Frame Object: Identity (no change)
      - HorizontalEdge Object: Mirror Horizontally
      - VerticalEdge Object: Mirror Vertically
      - Center Object: Rotate 180 degrees (or Identity)
  - assemble_output:
      - determine output grid size based on Frame/composite structure
      - place transformed objects onto the output grid in a specific layered order (Frame -> H-Edge -> V-Edge -> Center)
  - fill_background: use input background color for remaining empty cells within the composite shape boundary
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the background color of the input grid (the most frequent color).
2.  Find all distinct connected shapes (objects) formed by non-background colors in the input grid. Preserve any internal color variations within each shape.
3.  Select the 3 or 4 key objects that will form the output. (The selection criteria might involve object size, location, or specific colors).
4.  Assign a role to each selected object: 'Frame', 'Horizontal Contributor', 'Vertical Contributor', and potentially 'Center Contributor'. (The assignment logic needs further refinement but likely depends on relative positions or properties of the objects in the input).
5.  Determine the required transformations based on the assigned roles:
    *   The 'Frame' object is used as is (Identity transformation).
    *   The 'Horizontal Contributor' object is mirrored horizontally.
    *   The 'Vertical Contributor' object is mirrored vertically.
    *   The 'Center Contributor' object (if present) is rotated 180 degrees or used as is (Identity).
6.  Construct the output grid:
    *   Determine the dimensions of the output grid based on the size and arrangement of the transformed objects, often dictated by the extent of the 'Frame' object.
    *   Initialize the output grid.
    *   Place the untransformed 'Frame' object onto the output grid.
    *   Place the horizontally mirrored 'Horizontal Contributor' object onto the grid, positioned relative to the 'Frame'.
    *   Place the vertically mirrored 'Vertical Contributor' object onto the grid, positioned relative to the 'Frame'.
    *   If a 'Center Contributor' exists, place its transformed version (rotated 180 or identity) onto the grid, potentially overwriting pixels from previous steps.
7.  Fill any remaining empty cells within the boundary defined by the placed objects using the background color identified in step 1.
