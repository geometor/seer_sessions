            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements and Task:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids (arrays or matrices) containing single non-negative integers.\n2.  **Core Transformation:** The fundamental operation appears to be extracting a specific subgrid from the input grid. The dimensions and content of the output depend on identifying specific \"marker\" rows and columns within the input.\n3.  **Marker Identification:** The input grids contain distinct rows and columns that act as boundaries or markers. These markers are characterized by being predominantly filled with a single, non-zero digit, except potentially at their intersections. There seem to be exactly two marker rows and two marker columns in each input.\n4.  **Subgrid Extraction:** The output grid corresponds to the section of the input grid located between these marker rows (inclusive) and marker columns (inclusive).\n5.  **Value Propagation (Fill):** After extracting the subgrid, a secondary transformation occurs in some cases (like `train_3`). Zeroes (`0`) within the extracted subgrid are replaced by a specific \"fill value\" if they are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a cell already containing that fill value. This propagation continues iteratively until no more zeroes can be filled.\n6.  **Fill Value Determination:** The \"fill value\" used in the propagation step appears to be the dominant non-zero value found in the *second* marker column (the one with the larger column index).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n```"
