The size of the grid varies between examples.\n2.  **Cell Values**: The grids contain digits from 0 to 9. '0' appears to represent the background or empty space.\n3.  **Key Objects**:\n    *   **5-Squares**: A recurring pattern is a 2x2 block composed entirely of the digit '5'. These seem static; they appear in the same location in the output as in the input.\n    *   **Singleton Digits**: Other non-zero digits (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 in the examples) appear as individual cells. These digits seem to move from their input positions to new output positions.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern**: The core transformation involves relocating the singleton digits. Their final position in the output appears determined by their proximity to the nearest 5-square in the input. The 5-squares themselves act as anchors and remain unchanged. All original positions of the moved singletons become '0' in the output, unless replaced by another moved singleton (which doesn't happen in the examples).\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"

For each FiveSquare found, copy its four '5' values to the corresponding positions in the output grid. Store the top-left coordinates of each identified FiveSquare.\n3.
