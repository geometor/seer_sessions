Grid:
  Type: 2D array of integers
  Dimensions: Variable (e.g., 15x15, 10x10)
  BackgroundValue: 0

Objects:
  - Type: StaticAnchor
    Identifier: FiveSquare
    Structure: 2x2 grid cells
    Value: All cells contain the integer 5
    Behavior: Remains in the same position from input to output.

  - Type: MobileElement
    Identifier: SingletonDigit
    Structure: Single grid cell
    Value: Any integer from 1 to 9 (excluding 5 when part of a FiveSquare)
    Behavior: Moves from its input position to a new output position.

Relationships_and_Actions:
  - Action: Relocation
    Target: SingletonDigit
    Rule: Each SingletonDigit moves to a new location based on proximity to a FiveSquare.
    Proximity_Metric: Manhattan distance seems to apply.
    Destination_Rule:
      1. Find the FiveSquare whose center is closest (minimum Manhattan distance) to the SingletonDigit's input position.
         - Tie-breaking (if needed): Choose the FiveSquare whose top-left corner appears first in grid reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
      2. Identify the 12 cells immediately adjacent (N, S, E, W, diagonals) to the chosen FiveSquare.
      3. Find the adjacent cell closest (minimum Manhattan distance) to the SingletonDigit's original input position.
         - Tie-breaking: Choose the adjacent cell that appears first in grid reading order.
      4. The SingletonDigit moves to this determined adjacent cell in the output grid.
    Effect_on_Origin: The original input cell of the SingletonDigit becomes 0 in the output grid, unless overwritten by the destination of another SingletonDigit.
  - Action: Preservation
    Target: FiveSquare
    Rule: All cells belonging to a FiveSquare retain their value (5) and position in the output grid.
  - Action: Preservation
    Target: Background
    Rule: All cells with value 0 in the input remain 0 in the output, unless overwritten by a moved SingletonDigit.
