The exact shape and completeness of this structure vary.\n    *   The number '0' acts as the background color.\n    *   The output grid is largely identical to the input, but the original '1' is removed (set to 0), and certain areas originally containing '0' are filled with '1's.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n\n    "

Find the column index, `start_col`, of the cell containing '1' in the first row (row 0) of the input grid.\n    3.  Set the value of the cell at position (0, `start_col`) in the output grid to 0.\n    4.  Search downwards in the `start_col` column of the input grid, starting from row 1, to find the row index, `hit_row`, of the first cell containing the value '2'.\n    5.  If no '2' is found in `start_col` before reaching the bottom edge (i.e., `hit_row` is undefined), proceed to step 9.\n    6.  Attempt to identify a \"U\" structure based on the hit cell (`hit_row`, `start_col`):\n        a.  Find the column index `left_col` of the leftmost vertical bar connected to the potential horizontal bar at `hit_row`. This bar must end at `(hit_row, left_col)`.\n        b.  Find the column index `right_col` of the rightmost vertical bar connected to the potential horizontal bar at `hit_row`. This bar must end at `(hit_row, right_col)`.\n        c.  Verify that `left_col` and `right_col` were found, that `left_col < start_col < right_col`.\n        d.  Verify that all cells from (`hit_row`, `left_col`) to (`hit_row`, `right_col`) contain '2'.\n        e.  Determine the height `k` (where `k > 0`) of the vertical bars at `left_col` and `right_col`, ensuring they are of equal height and consist entirely of '2's from row `hit_row - k` to `hit_row - 1`, with '0's or grid boundaries immediately above them at row `hit_row - k - 1`.\n    7.  If all conditions in step 6 (a-e) are met (a valid, complete \"U\" structure is found containing `start_col` between its posts):\n        a.  Define the fill area: rows from `hit_row - k` to `hit_row - 1` (inclusive), and columns from `left_col + 1` to `right_col - 1` (inclusive).\n        b.  Set the value of all cells within this fill area in the output grid to '1'.\n        c.  Proceed to step 10.\n    8.  If the conditions in step 6 are *not* fully met (no '2' found initially, or no valid/complete \"U\" structure identified, or `start_col` was not strictly between `left_col` and `right_col`):\n        a.  Fill the entire last row (row 9) of the output grid with '1's (from column 0 to 9).\n    9.  The transformation is complete. Return the output grid."
