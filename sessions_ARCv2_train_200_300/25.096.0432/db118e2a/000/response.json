            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are 2D grids (matrices) containing single-digit integers.\n2.  **Grid Size:** The input grids have varying dimensions (e.g., 9x7, 7x8, 9x9, 6x7). The output grid is consistently 15x15 across all examples.\n3.  **Content:** The digits present in the input are also present in the output. A dominant digit, '7', appears frequently, especially in the output grid, suggesting it might be a background or border color.\n4.  **Structure:** The output grid appears to contain two copies of the input grid pattern embedded within a larger grid mostly filled with '7'.\n5.  **Placement:**\n    *   By comparing the input `train_4` (6x7) with its output (15x15), we can identify the placement of the copies.\n    *   The first copy of the input seems to be placed starting at row index 2, column index 3 of the output grid (using 0-based indexing). The segment `Output[2:8, 3:10]` exactly matches the input.\n    *   The second copy of the input seems to be placed starting at row index 8, column index 9 of the output grid. The segment `Output[8:14, 9:16]` (clipped to the 15x15 boundary) exactly matches the input.\n6.  **Overlapping:** Where the second copy's placement area overlaps with the first copy's area, the values from the second copy overwrite those from the first. This is observable by checking overlapping cells in the examples (e.g., `train_1`, Output[8, 9]).\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
