The results across multiple examples clearly show this isn't the complete rule. While the size and color palette are consistently correct, the pixel placement is wrong in all four test cases. This suggests the core logic of *row-wise* most frequent color replacement is incorrect, or at least incomplete.  The expected outputs consistently show large areas of 0s, suggesting a broader rule about when to use 0 vs. 5. A key observation is that the *expected* output uses 5 for the most frequent color *in the entire grid*, not per row.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1. **Verify Global Frequency:** The core hypothesis to test is whether the most frequent color *globally* (across the entire grid) determines the cells that become 5.  I'll use code execution to confirm this by calculating the most frequent color for each input grid and comparing it to the provided outputs.\n2. **Refine the Natural Language Program:**  Based on the verification, I'll rewrite the natural language program to accurately reflect the global frequency rule.\n3. **YAML Facts:** Update the facts to reflect the object (the grid), its properties (most frequent color), and the action (replacement based on global frequency).\n\n**Gather Metrics & Verification (Code Execution):**\n\n"
