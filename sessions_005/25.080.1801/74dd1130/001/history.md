Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, aiming to discern the transformation logic:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 3x3 grids with single-digit integers representing colors. The transformation seems to re-arrange the elements (pixels) of the input grid to produce the output grid. There's no obvious arithmetic or color-based operation. The transformation appears to be a permutation of the elements based on their positions. It is a reordering or shuffling of grid cells.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: |
  The task involves transforming a 3x3 input grid of single-digit integers into a 3x3 output grid.
  The transformation is a permutation (reordering) of the grid cells.

objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array (3x3)
    properties:
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array (3x3)
    properties:
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors

actions:
  - name: reorder_cells
    description: Permutes the cells of the input_grid to create the output_grid.
    parameters:
      - mapping: A specific rule defining how the input cell positions map to the output cell positions.

relationships:
  - input_grid and output_grid have the same dimensions (3x3).
  - output_grid's elements are a permutation of input_grid's elements.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the 3x3 input grid.
2.  **Transformation:**
    *   Iterate through input matrix columns in reverse order.
    *  Take cell values column wise and construct the output matrix
3.  **Output:** The resulting 3x3 grid is the output.

In simpler term, imagine columns of the matrix numbered as 1, 2 and 3. Swap column 1 and column 3, and keep column 2 as it is.
