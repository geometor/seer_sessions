While the output grid dimensions are sometimes swapped (indicating a potential transpose-like operation), the pixel values are not correctly placed according to a simple transpose. The consistent `pixels_off` values and the `size_correct` being true in cases where dimensions *are* swapped suggest there's a systematic misplacement of pixels, not a wholly different operation. My strategy is to examine the pixel mappings more closely to discern the actual rule, focusing on how rows and columns of the input relate to the rows and columns of the output.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Evidence:**\n\nI need to understand the row and column relationships.\n\nI don't have direct access to the `correct_pixel_counts`. Let me clarify the meaning of `pixels_off` first. From the context, it suggests the number of pixels that do not match, the difference.\n\n"
