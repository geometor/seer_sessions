"""
The transformation rule is to transpose the input grid. This means the input grid is mirrored along its main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right). The element at row `i` and column `j` in the input grid will be placed at row `j` and column `i` in the output grid. In other words, swap the row and column indices of each element to obtain the output grid.
