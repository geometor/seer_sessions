The transformation seems to involve a directional fill or replication of values based on existing non-zero values, propagating to the bottom-right. The \"filling\" color appears to be determined by a specific non-zero cell. The operation essentially extends existing elements in the grid in specific direction/pattern.\n\n**YAML Block of Facts**\n\n"
