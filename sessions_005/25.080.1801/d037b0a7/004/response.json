            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the first attempt and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a reasonable hypothesis, focusing on a \"seed\" cell and downward/rightward filling. However, the results clearly show it's not universally correct. The errors in all three examples suggest a flaw in how the filling is controlled. The core issue seems to be an overly aggressive fill that doesn't properly consider the context of neighboring cells in all cases, and only applying the seed to a direct fill, and not filling to right completely.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully look at the *differences* between the expected outputs and the generated outputs. This will pinpoint exactly *where* the logic is failing. It appears we fill down correctly based on a seed and to the right correctly, but do not fill correctly both down *and* to the right.\n2.  **Refine the Fill Logic:** The current logic seems too simplistic. It's not just about filling down from the seed; there's likely a more complex rule about *when* and *where* to propagate the seed value. We need to consider what the seed cell condition is.\n3.  **Consider Alternative Interpretations:** Maybe \"seed cell\" is not the correct base concept.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's analyze each example to understand the specific failures:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 0, 6], [0, 4, 0], [3, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Expected: `[[0, 0, 6], [0, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6]]`\n    *   Actual: `[[0, 0, 6], [0, 4, 0], [3, 4, 0]]`\n    *   *Observation:* The seed (6) should have propagated to (1,2) and (2,2). The actual only partially fills based on other seeds.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 2, 0], [7, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Expected: `[[0, 2, 0], [7, 2, 8], [7, 2, 8]]`\n    *   Actual: `[[0, 2, 0], [7, 0, 8], [7, 0, 8]]`\n    *    *Observation:*  The seed value from cell (0,1) - value 2, should propagate down, but so should the 7 and the 8 from the second row.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[[4, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Expected: `[[4, 0, 0], [4, 2, 0], [4, 2, 0]]`\n    *   Actual: `[[4, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0]]`\n    *   *Observation:* The seed (4) should have propagated down, and seed 2 as well.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
