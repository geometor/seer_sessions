Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception:**

The input grids seem to contain single-color objects (contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color) against a black background (represented by 0). The outputs appear to be condensed representations of these objects, extracting and potentially duplicating the non-black color. The output dimensions seem related to the number of non-black pixels in the input, but not a direct mapping of the spatial arrangement.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
observations:
  - task_type: object_extraction_and_reconstruction
  - input_objects:
      - description: Single-color regions within a black grid.
        properties:
          - color: Varies (1, 2, 7, 8 in the examples).
          - shape: Irregular, but contiguous.
          - size: Varies.
  - output_objects:
      - description: Condensed representation of the input object's color.
        properties:
          - color: Same as the input object's color.
          - shape: Rectangular, size varies between 1 x N
          - size: Equal to the number of non-zero cells in the input.
  - transformations:
      - action: Extract non-black color.
      - action: Count the number of non-black pixels.
      - action: Create output grid with non-black color repeated that count
      - result: A compact rectangular grid containing only the extracted color.
  - relationships:
      - input_color: output_color
      - input_non_black_pixels : output_size

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the non-black color:** Scan the input grid and find the color value that is not 0 (black).
2.  **Count non-black pixels:** Count the total number of pixels in the input grid that have the non-black color identified in step 1.
3.  **Construct the output grid:** Create a new 1D grid (height=1) where:
    *   The color of all pixels is the non-black color found in step 1.
    *   The length (width) of the grid is equal to the count of non-black pixels found in step 2.

Essentially, the program extracts the non-black color, counts its occurrences, and creates a horizontal line of that color with a length equal to the count.
