            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code performs a 90-degree clockwise rotation and then reverses the order of the rows. This works for some cases, but not all. The provided examples and test results show discrepancies, indicating that the row reversal (flipping) is incorrect, or perhaps, only conditionally required or applied incorrectly. It seems like the core issue is a misinterpretation of the required row operations *after* the rotation.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Rotation:** Double-check that the 90-degree clockwise rotation is indeed the correct basic transformation.\n2.  **Analyze Row/Column Operations:** Carefully examine the input and expected output of *both* examples to discern the *precise* row or column manipulation (if any) that occurs *after* the rotation. It might not be a simple full reversal. It could be a shift, a partial reversal, or something else entirely.\n3.  **Metrics Gathering:** Use python to compute a cell-by-cell comparison of the transformed output and the expected output, noting not just the number of incorrect pixels but also their positions and values. This helps pinpoint the nature of the error.\n4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the analysis, rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe the *full* transformation.\n5.  **Update code and Test** Test the updated code based on the revised natural language program.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (using python tool):**\n\nI need to understand where the errors are within grid.\n\n"

The positions and values of the incorrect pixels are crucial.
