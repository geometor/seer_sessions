    description: |
      Each element in the input grid is replicated diagonally down and to the right in the output grid, and shifts to the right. The output grid is twice the size of the input grid. Spaces not filled by diagonal replication from top left are filled with black (0).
      For each cell (i, j) of the input grid, its content is replicated in output grid, to the cell at position (i+k, j+k) where k is the number of shift and equal to row index of each input cell.
