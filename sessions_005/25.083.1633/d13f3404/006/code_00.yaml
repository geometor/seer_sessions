objects:
  input_grid:
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  output_grid:
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 6x6 (double the input)
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors

actions:
  - name: replicate_diagonally
    input: input_grid cell value, input_grid cell coordinates (i, j)
    output: output_grid
    description: >
      For each cell in the input grid, its value is replicated diagonally
      in the output grid.  The replication starts at the cell (i, j).
      The value is copied also in positions
      (i + 1, j + 1), (i + 2, j+ 2), and so on in the output,
      until the boundaries of the output array are reached. This is done also
      from (i, j+1) and so on.
