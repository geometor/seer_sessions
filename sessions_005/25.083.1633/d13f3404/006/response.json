            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code only replicates the top-left element of the input grid diagonally. It doesn't correctly propagate the other elements of the input grid to their corresponding positions in the output grid. The core issue is that the initial code did implement the core transformation. The error is that it missed the instructions related to the replication starting at the next row.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Results:** Carefully examine each input, expected output, and transformed output to pinpoint exactly where the current logic fails.\n2.  **Object & Action Identification**: Use this analysis to refine the YAML file.\n3. **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update instructions.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using visual inspection, no code execution needed for this simple case):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 3x3\n    *   Output: 6x6\n    *   Error: Only the first diagonal (0, 4, 0) from the first input row is present. The diagonals starting from the subsequent elements (8, 2) are missing or incorrectly placed, as are elements 8 and 2 from the next input rows.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 3x3\n    *   Output: 6x6\n    *   Error: Similar to Example 1, only the first diagonal (6, 1, 0) appears. The subsequent elements (3, 0, 0) aren't correctly replicated and offset.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 3x3\n    *   Output: 6x6\n    *   Error: The first diagonal (0, 0, 6) and then the (1,3) partially present. The expected shifted diagonals are not fully constructed.\n\n**YAML Description:**\n\n"
