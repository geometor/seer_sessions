objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 6x6 (double the input_grid)
      - elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)

actions:
  - name: replicate_diagonally
    description: Copy elements from input_grid to output_grid along diagonals.
    details:
      - start: Each diagonal starts at the corresponding row and column index in the output_grid matching the element's position in the input_grid.
      - shift: The starting column for each diagonal shifts one position to the right for each subsequent row of the input grid.
      - fill:  If a cell in output_grid is not filled by the diagonal replication, it will be 0.
