facts:
  - observation: "Input grids are smaller than output grids."
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: "rows x cols"
      - content: "2D array of color values (0-9)"
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: "(input_rows * (input_cols + input_rows -1) ) x (input_cols * 2) "
      - content: "2D array of color values, derived from input_grid"
  - relationship: "output_grid contains a diagonally replicated pattern from input_grid"
  - action: replication
    description: "input_grid elements are replicated diagonally downwards and to the right"
  - constraint: "Output grid is filled with 0s (black) except for the diagonal replications."
  - action: output_grid_size_determination
    description: "The output grid's height and width are determined based on input grid height and width"
