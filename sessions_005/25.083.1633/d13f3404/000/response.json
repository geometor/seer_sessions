The input grid's elements appear to be replicated diagonally downwards, creating a pattern. The dimensions of the output grid seem to be related to the dimensions of the input grid, specifically, the output's height is a multiple of the input's. The new cells in between diagonals are black (0).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
