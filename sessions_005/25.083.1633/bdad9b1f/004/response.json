            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the natural language program and subsequently the code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code have several flaws, as evidenced by the failed tests on both examples. The core issues seem to be:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Yellow Transformation:** The yellow transformation logic is not correctly applied in both cases. It extends beyond intended bounds. The rule should be that red pixels *on the red row and left of the right-most azure pixel* get changed to yellow up to, and including, the rightmost azure's column. The existing program isn't handling red pixels after the rightmost azure, which should stay red. It's also incorrectly interpreting the stopping condition.\n2.  **Azure Row Duplication Error**: The program is supposed to insert copies of the azure rows *immediately* after the modified \"red row\", and only once per red row. Currently the code is duplicating the Azure rows, but doing so incorrectly, putting them below *all other* lines, rather than just below the red.\n3. **Misinterpretation of Red and Azure Rows:** The problem description needs refinement on the relationship between red and azure rows.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze *both* examples, paying close attention to the positions of red and azure pixels, and how the transformation affects the red row specifically.\n2.  **Refine Transformation Rule:** Rewrite the natural language program to be absolutely precise about *which* red pixels change to yellow, and the *exact* placement of duplicated azure rows.\n3.  **Metrics and Debug:** Before changing the code, it would be helpful to write a report of the examples, expected outputs, and test outputs. This would involve using numpy arrays.\n\n**Metrics and Data Gathering (using `tool_code`):**\n\nI'll use code to generate reports for each example, comparing the expected and actual outputs. This will help pinpoint the exact pixel differences.\n\n"
