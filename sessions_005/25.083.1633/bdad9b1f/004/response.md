Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the natural language program and subsequently the code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code have several flaws, as evidenced by the failed tests on both examples. The core issues seem to be:

1.  **Incorrect Yellow Transformation:** The yellow transformation logic is not correctly applied in both cases. It extends beyond intended bounds. The rule should be that red pixels *on the red row and left of the right-most azure pixel* get changed to yellow up to, and including, the rightmost azure's column. The existing program isn't handling red pixels after the rightmost azure, which should stay red. It's also incorrectly interpreting the stopping condition.
2.  **Azure Row Duplication Error**: The program is supposed to insert copies of the azure rows *immediately* after the modified "red row", and only once per red row. Currently the code is duplicating the Azure rows, but doing so incorrectly, putting them below *all other* lines, rather than just below the red.
3. **Misinterpretation of Red and Azure Rows:** The problem description needs refinement on the relationship between red and azure rows.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze *both* examples, paying close attention to the positions of red and azure pixels, and how the transformation affects the red row specifically.
2.  **Refine Transformation Rule:** Rewrite the natural language program to be absolutely precise about *which* red pixels change to yellow, and the *exact* placement of duplicated azure rows.
3.  **Metrics and Debug:** Before changing the code, it would be helpful to write a report of the examples, expected outputs, and test outputs. This would involve using numpy arrays.

**Metrics and Data Gathering (using `tool_code`):**

I'll use code to generate reports for each example, comparing the expected and actual outputs. This will help pinpoint the exact pixel differences.


``` python
import numpy as np

def compare_grids(expected, actual, example_num):
    expected_grid = np.array(expected)
    actual_grid = np.array(actual)

    print(f"Example {example_num}:")
    print("Expected Output:")
    print(expected_grid)
    print("\nActual Output:")
    print(actual_grid)

    if expected_grid.shape != actual_grid.shape:
        print(f"\nShape mismatch: Expected {expected_grid.shape}, Actual {actual_grid.shape}")
    else:
        diff = expected_grid != actual_grid
        if np.any(diff):
            print("\nMismatched pixel coordinates and values:")
            coords = np.where(diff)
            for y, x in zip(coords[0], coords[1]):
                print(f"  Row: {y}, Col: {x}, Expected: {expected_grid[y, x]}, Actual: {actual_grid[y, x]}")
        else:
            print("\nGrids are identical.")
    print("-" * 40)

# Example 1 Data

compare_grids(example1_expected, example1_actual, 1)
compare_grids(example2_expected, example2_actual, 2)

 [0 8 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 2 2]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]]

Shape mismatch: Expected (6, 6), Actual (8, 6)

 [2 2 2 2 4 2]
 [0 0 0 0 8 0]

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Rows:** Find all rows that contain at least one red (2) pixel (these are "red_rows").  Also, find all rows that contain at least one azure (8) pixel ("azure_rows").

2.  **Iterate Through Rows:** Process the input grid row by row.

3.  **Preserve Non-Red Rows:** If the current row is *not* a "red_row", copy it to the output grid without changes.

4.  **Process Red Rows:** If the current row *is* a "red_row":
    *   Find the column index of the rightmost azure (8) pixel *in the entire input grid*.
    *   Find the column index of the leftmost red (2) pixel *in the current "red_row"*.
    *   Change all pixels in the current "red_row", starting from the leftmost red pixel, to yellow (4), up to *and including* the column of the rightmost azure pixel found in step 4a.
    *   If any red pixels in the current "red_row" are located *to the right* of the rightmost azure pixel's column, they remain red.
    * Copy this modified row to the output.

5.  **Duplicate Azure Rows:** Immediately after adding the modified "red_row" to the output grid, add copies of *all* "azure_rows". Maintain the original order of the "azure_rows".

6. **Output:** The result is the output grid.
