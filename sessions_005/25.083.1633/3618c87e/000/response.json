The most prominent feature is the consistent presence of a horizontal line of gray (5) pixels at the bottom of both input and output grids. There's also a blue (1) pixel present in the input that seems to shift its position in the output, but always on the gray line. The rows above the solid gray line are always all black/white(0) in the output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

If there is no blue pixel in a column, maintain the position of grey(5).\n\nEssentially, the transformation clears the top rows and moves the position of\neach blue pixel down to the bottom (gray) row, while maintaining the columns.\nThe position of other grey(5) pixels move to the bottom row.\n"
