1.  **Identify 2x2 Green Squares:** Scan the input grid to find all 2x2 squares where *all four* pixels are green (value 3).
2.  **Record Top-Left Coordinates:**  For each identified 2x2 green square, store the (row, column) coordinates of its top-left pixel.
3.  **Transform to Azure:** Iterate through the list of recorded coordinates. For each coordinate:
    *   Change the color of the 2x2 square starting at that top left coordinate, setting each cell to azure (value 8).
4.  **Output:** Return the modified grid. The output grid will have the same dimensions as the input grid, with identified 2x2 green squares replaced with azure, and all other pixels remaining the same as the input.
