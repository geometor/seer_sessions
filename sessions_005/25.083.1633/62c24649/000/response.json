The output grid seems to be a 2x2 repetition of the input grid, but with a twist: it's not a direct copy.  It appears as though the input grid is both reflected and rotated. The dimensions of the output grid are always double the dimensions of the input grid (both width and height).\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

The output grid will have twice the number of rows and twice the number of columns of the input grid.\n4. **Mirror and combine:** Create output grid by combining the following operations, generating 4 copies combined in a 2x2 grid:\n   - original grid.\n   - horizontal mirroring\n   - vertical mirroring\n   - horizontal and vertical mirroring.\n5.  **Output:** Return the resulting output grid.\n\nIn other words.\n\nCreate four quadrants in output grid. The Top Left quadrant is the original input, the top right quadrant is a horizontal mirror of the input, the bottom left is the vertical mirror and the bottom right is a combined horizontal and vertical mirror.\n"
