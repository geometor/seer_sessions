  output:
      - value: 5

      - value: 4
        final_positions: [(2,3)]
  transformation:
    - description: "Non-zero values shift within their columns. The shift appears to 'push' values up, with 0s filling in spaces below. If a value would be shifted out of bounds it wraps to the bottom of the output grid for the same column it appeared in the input."
