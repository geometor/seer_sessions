Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program description:

**Perception of Elements:**

The core element appears to be the extraction of a specific portion of the input grid. The input grids seem to consist of repeating patterns of columns, and the output consistently extracts a single instance of that repeating pattern. The dimensions of the output grid's width are a fraction of the input's width. The height appears to remain constant, the width shrinks.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input is a rectangular grid of single-digit integers (colors).
  - observation: |
      The output is a rectangular grid of single-digit integers (colors).
  - observation: |
      The output grid's height is the same as the input grid's height.
  - observation: |
      The output grid's width is smaller than the input grid's width.
  - observation: |
      The output grid appears to be a section of columns extracted from the input.
  - observation: |
      Input contains horizontally repeating patterns.
  - relationship: |
      The input is transformed into the output by extracting a single set of columns that form the repeating pattern.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Repeating Columns:** Analyze the input grid to identify the repeating sequence of columns. This can be done by comparing adjacent columns to find the shortest sequence that repeats horizontally.
2.  **Extract One Set of Columns:** Once the repeating pattern is found, extract one instance of those columns.
3.  **Form Output Grid:** Create the output grid using the extracted columns, preserving the original height of the input grid.

In essence, the transformation rule is to "extract the fundamental repeating column unit from the input grid".
