observations:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D arrays of integers.
    properties:
      - height: Input height is twice the output height.
      - width: Input width is greater than or equal to the output width.
      - values: Integers 0-9, representing colors.
  - type: object
    description: Non-zero pixels can be considered individual objects.
    properties:
      - color: Defined by the integer value.
      - position: (row, column) within the grid.
  - type: transformation
    description: Input grid is reduced to the output grid.
    actions:
      - row_removal: Even-numbered rows (starting from index 0) are removed.
      - column_handling: Columns with only zeros are removed. Columns containing at least one non zero number are preseved.
  - type: relationship
    description: positional relationship of non zero numbers
    properties:
       - horizontal_order: horizontal order is preserved.
