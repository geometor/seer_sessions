The input grids are consistently larger (specifically, double the height) than the output grids. The transformation seems to involve a reduction in size, specifically removing rows.  Non-zero values are important, and zero values act like a background or filler. The horizontal structure seems to be preserved, while the vertical structure is compressed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
