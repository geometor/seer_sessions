facts:
  - description: The input and output grids always have the same dimensions.
    type: observation
    evidence: All examples show matching input and output shapes.

  - description: Yellow (4) pixels in the input grid are transformed to magenta (6) pixels in the output grid.
    type: transformation
    evidence: Color counts show a decrease in yellow pixels and a corresponding increase in magenta pixels.

  - description: Green (3) pixels in the input grid are transformed to magenta (6) pixels in the output grid.
    type: transformation
    evidence: Color counts show a decrease in green pixels and a corresponding increase in magenta pixels.

  - description: White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
    type: transformation
    evidence: The number of white pixels remains constant between the input and output grids in all examples.

  - description: No cropping or resizing occurs.
    type: observation
    evidence: Input and output dimensions are identical across all examples.
