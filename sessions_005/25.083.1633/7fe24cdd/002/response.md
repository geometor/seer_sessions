Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code attempts to embed a 3x3 input grid into a 6x6 output grid and then perform reflections. However, the reflection logic is incorrect, leading to mismatches in pixel positions and overall pattern. The strategy to fix this is to correctly implement the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal reflections. It seems the diagonal reflection implemented via `reflect_corner` is incorrect. We need to transpose the input grid, in essence making rows into columns, and place the result in the bottom right 3x3 corner of the 6x6 output array. We should check our assumption regarding row and column reflection.

**Gather Metrics & Analysis (using manual inspection, and referencing the code and results):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: 3x3
    *   Output Shape: 6x6
    *   Pixels Off: 20.  This means a substantial part of the reflection is incorrect.
    *   The provided expected and actual outputs don't appear related.  This implies an error beyond simple mis-reflection.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: 3x3
    *   Output Shape: 6x6
    *   Pixels Off: 10. Still many errors, but fewer than the first.
    *   Again, general observation suggests more than a diagonal reflection issue.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: 3x3
    *   Output Shape: 6x6
    *   Pixels Off: 8.  The fewest errors of all, yet incorrect.
    *   The output suggests an issue in placement of the horizontal reflection.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a 6x6 output grid filled with zeros.
2.  **Embedding:** Copy the 3x3 input grid into the top-left corner (rows 0-2, columns 0-2) of the output grid.
3.  **Horizontal Reflection:** Reflect the input grid horizontally. Copy the input grid to the top-right corner of the output grid (rows 0-2, columns 3-5), reversing the column order.
4.  **Vertical Reflection:** Reflect the input grid vertically. Copy the input grid to the bottom-left corner of the output grid (rows 3-5, columns 0-2), reversing the row order.
5.  **Diagonal Reflection (Top-Left to Bottom-Right):** Reflect the input grid diagonally. Copy the transposed input grid (rows become columns, columns become rows) to the bottom-right corner of the output grid (rows 3-5, columns 3-5).
