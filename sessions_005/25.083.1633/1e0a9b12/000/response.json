It *looks* like the non-zero digits are being moved to the bottom of the grid.\n*   **Preservation:** Non-zero values are preserved; zeros seem to fill the vacated spaces.\n*   No obvious size change: inputs and outputs are the same dimensions\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Stack them from bottom to top, filling rows from left to right\n4.  **Fill:** Fill all remaining (empty) cells in the output grid with zeros.\n\nIn simpler terms, the transformation rule is to take all the non-zero numbers from the input and \"stack\" them at the bottom of the output grid, while filling the rest with zeros, without changing the input order.\n"
