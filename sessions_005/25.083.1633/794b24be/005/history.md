Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and formulate a revised natural language program and supporting observations.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a limited understanding derived from the first example. The subsequent tests reveal a significant flaw in the logic: the code only replaces contiguous '1's starting from the *leftmost* cell of each row. The expected outputs, however, show that a row of all '1's should be *completely* replaced with '2's, and this should fill to the right of the original row as well. Further more it appears all 1s should be changed to 2s.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Gather Metrics:** Analyze each input/output/transformed output triplet.  I'll use string manipulation and potentially numpy to examine the grids and pinpoint exactly where the transformations differ. I need to verify a revised hypothesis: *All* 1s in the input grid are replaced with 2s, *all* other values remain the same, and 2's are filled in to the right of the matrix to match a new shape.
2.  **YAML Documentation:**  Create a YAML block summarizing key observations. This will focus on object identification (the grid), properties (colors/values), and actions (replacement).
3.  **Revised Natural Language Program:**  Based on the metric analysis and YAML documentation, draft a new natural language program that accurately captures the transformation.

**Gather Metrics:**

I don't need code execution here. I can perform the analysis directly based on the given data. The core observation is that ALL 1s are converted to 2s, REGARDLESS of their position. This immediately contradicts the previous "contiguous from left" logic. The size is not always the same between input and output.

Here's a breakdown of observations, focusing on the discrepancies:

*   **Example 1:** Input has 1s. Output has 2s where the 1s were, and extra 2's to the right of the matrix.
*   **Example 2:** Input has 1s. Output has 2s where the 1s were, and extra 2's to the right of the matrix.
*   **Example 3:** Input has a 1. Output has a 2 where the 1 was, and an additional 2 to fill the width of the 3x3 matrix.
*   **Example 4:** Input has 1s. Output has 2s where the 1s were, and extra 2's to the right of the matrix.
*   **Example 5:** Input has 1s. Output has 2s where the 1s were, and extra 2's to the right of the matrix.
*   **Example 6:** Input has 1s. Output has 2s where the 1s were, and extra 2's to the right of the matrix.
*   **Example 7:** Input has a 1. Output has a 2 where the 1 was, and an additional 2 to fill the width of the 3x3 matrix.
*   **Example 8:** Input has a 1. Output has a 2 where the 1 was, and an additional 2 to fill the width of the 3x3 matrix.
*   **Example 9:** Input has a 1. Output has a 2 where the one was, and the row is filled with 0's. The shape stays the same.
*    **Example 10:** Input has a 1. Output has a 2 where the one was, and the row is filled with 0's. The shape stays the same.

**YAML Documentation:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents the initial state, containing values 0 and 1.
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents the transformed state, containing values 0 and 2, where the 2 might expand.

properties:
  - name: color
    values: [0, 1, 2]
    mapping:
      0: white
      1: blue
      2: red

actions:
  - name: replace
    description: All instances of value 1 in the input_grid are replaced with value 2 in the output_grid, and the matrix might expand to the right with all 2s.
  - name: preserve
    description: All instances of value 0 in the input_grid remain as value 0 in the output_grid.
```


**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  The input grid is examined.
2.  All occurrences of the value '1' (blue) within the input grid are replaced with the value '2' (red).
3.  If a row in the *output* grid has the value '2', expand that row to be filled with '2's. The shape changes.

The previous assumptions around "contiguity" were incorrect. The transformation is a simple, global replacement of 1s with 2s and filling the whole row if there are any 2s.
