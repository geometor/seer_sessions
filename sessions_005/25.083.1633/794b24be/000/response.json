The most prominent change is the replacement of '1' (blue) pixels with '2' (red) pixels. The position of the replaced pixels seems significant.  Specifically the pattern of replacement varies, sometimes only the first '1' is converted, other times multiple and up to all are replaced. There is a priority or ordering involved - replacement seems start with at the top left '1' and works from left to right, top to bottom. Zeros (white) remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

If the first row contains one or more `1` values, change all `1` values in the grid to `2`. If only one `1` exists in a single row, and no other `1` values are in any previous row, then convert the `1` to `2`.\n"
