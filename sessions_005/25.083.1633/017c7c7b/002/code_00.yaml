facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - input_shape:  [variable, 3] # All inputs have 3 columns
      - output_shape: [variable, 3] # All outputs have 3 columns. Output height >= input height.
      - height_relationship: "Output height is always greater than or equal to the input height, and is extended to the next odd number."
  - transformation:
      - action: substitution
        details: "Blue (1) pixels in the input grid are replaced with red (2) pixels in the output grid."
      - action: extend_rows
        details: |
          Rows are added to the output grid.  The added rows follow a specific pattern.
           - The first column is always 0.
           - The second column is always 2.
           - The third column alternates between 0 and 2, starting from the top, it should match the pattern in the original image.
  - pattern: column_3_alternation
    details: |
       The third column of the *entire* output grid, alternates between 0 and 2 for consecutive rows. The pattern for the extended rows continues from the input grid pattern.
