Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** The input consists of 2D grids of varying heights but a consistent width of 3. The grids contain only the values 0 (white) and 1 (blue). There is always a vertical blue stripe in the middle, and white to the left and right.\n*   **Output:** The output grids have the same dimensions of their input grids. The output consists of 2D grids with values of 0 (white) and 2 (red). The vertical central stripe of 1 is now 2. Crucially, the output grid height is always equal or greater than the height of the associated input grid. The value 2 (red) is substituted for the 1 (blue), and additional rows of the same pattern are added.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

Maintain all 0 (white) values.\n2. **Extend Height**: The output grid is always equal or greater height than the input. Create new rows with the `0 2 0` pattern to pad the output.\nThe output grid height appears to always be odd, so use the `0 2 0` pattern and stop when the next full pattern won't fit.\n\n"
