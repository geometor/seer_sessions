Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided examples and discern the transformation logic. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** The input consists of 2D grids of varying heights but a consistent width of 3. The grids contain only the values 0 (white) and 1 (blue). There is always a vertical blue stripe in the middle, and white to the left and right.
*   **Output:** The output grids have the same dimensions of their input grids. The output consists of 2D grids with values of 0 (white) and 2 (red). The vertical central stripe of 1 is now 2. Crucially, the output grid height is always equal or greater than the height of the associated input grid. The value 2 (red) is substituted for the 1 (blue), and additional rows of the same pattern are added.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      values: [0, 1]
      width: 3
      height: variable
      pattern: vertical stripe of 1s in the center, 0s on either side

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      values: [0, 2]
      width: 3
      height: >= input_grid.height
      pattern: vertical stripe of 2s in the center, 0s on either side. Height is extended.

  - transformation:
    type: substitution
    details: Replace all 1s with 2s.

  - transformation:
      type: extend_height
      details: add rows at the bottom using the pattern to reach a certain height.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Substitution:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid. If a cell's value is 1 (blue), replace it with 2 (red) in the output grid. Maintain all 0 (white) values.
2. **Extend Height**: The output grid is always equal or greater height than the input. Create new rows with the `0 2 0` pattern to pad the output.
The output grid height appears to always be odd, so use the `0 2 0` pattern and stop when the next full pattern won't fit.
