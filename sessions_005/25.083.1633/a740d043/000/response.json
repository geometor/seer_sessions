The input grids appear to mostly consist of the digit '1' (blue), with a few other digits forming rectangular shapes within the '1's. The output grids seem to be related to these non-'1' regions, potentially extracting or summarizing them. The dimensions of the output are significantly smaller than the input. There's no obvious rotation or mirroring. The key seems to be identifying and isolating the non-1 regions and representing them, possibly in a compressed form.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
