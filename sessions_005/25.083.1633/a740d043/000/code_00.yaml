facts:
  - observation: Input grids are rectangular and mostly filled with '1' (blue).
  - observation: Non-'1' values form contiguous rectangular blocks.
  - observation: Output grids are smaller than input grids.
  - observation: Output grid values correspond to the non-'1' values in the input grid.
  - observation: The output grid seems to represent only non-1 colored pixels in order of apperance
  - object: InputGrid, type: 2D array, values: integers 0-9
  - object: OutputGrid, type: 2D array, values: integers 0-9
  - property: InputGrid.size > OutputGrid.size
  - action: Extract non-'1' regions from InputGrid.
  - action: Create a compressed representation in OutputGrid.
  - relationship: InputGrid values map to OutputGrid values.
  - relationship: The spatial arrangement of non-'1' blocks in InputGrid influences the structure of OutputGrid.
