facts:
  - observation: |
      The input is a 2D grid of integers, where each integer likely represents a color.
  - observation: |
      The output is also a 2D grid of integers.
  - observation: |
     The width (number of columns) of the output grid is the same as the width of the input grid.
  - observation: |
      The height (number of rows) of the output grid is double the height of the input grid.
  - relationship: |
      The top half of the output grid appears to be a vertically flipped version of the input grid.
  - relationship: |
     The original input grid becomes the bottom half of the output grid.
  - operation: |
      Vertical reflection (flip) of the input grid.
  - operation: |
    Concatenation of the vertically flipped grid with the original grid, to become bottom half of the grid
