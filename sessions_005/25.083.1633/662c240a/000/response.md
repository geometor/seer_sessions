Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and try to understand the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of varying sizes, with each cell containing a single digit (0-9) representing a color.
*   The transformation seems to focus on extracting a specific portion of the input grid and presenting it as the output grid.
*   The extracted portion appears to always be a rectangular sub-grid.
*   Visually the sub-grid is the last or bottom sub-grid of a repeating vertical pattern.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        rows: variable (3-9 in examples)
        columns: 3
        cells: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - output_grid:
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        rows: variable, same as input
        columns: 3
        cells: integers (0-9, representing colors)
relationships:
  - output_grid IS_SUBGRID_OF input_grid
actions:
  - extract:
      input: input_grid
      output: output_grid
      description: Selects a specific rectangular region from the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Repeating Pattern:** Observe the input grid and identify vertically repeating patterns based on sub-grids of rows.

2.  **Extract Last Pattern:** Extract the last occurrence of that repeating pattern, this sub-grid is the output.

3. **Output Sub-grid:** Return sub-grid of the identified rows.

In essence, the rule isolates and outputs the bottom or last repeating block of rows in the input grid.
