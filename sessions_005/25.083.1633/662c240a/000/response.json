Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves 2D grids of varying sizes, with each cell containing a single digit (0-9) representing a color.\n*   The transformation seems to focus on extracting a specific portion of the input grid and presenting it as the output grid.\n*   The extracted portion appears to always be a rectangular sub-grid.\n*   Visually the sub-grid is the last or bottom sub-grid of a repeating vertical pattern.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
