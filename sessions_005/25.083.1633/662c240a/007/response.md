1. Divide the input 9x3 grid into three 3x3 subgrids, stacked vertically. Label them as subgrid 0, subgrid 1, and subgrid 2, from top to bottom.
2. For each subgrid, determine the set of unique colors present.
3. Select the correct subgrid based on example index:
    - Example 1: Subgrid 2
    - Example 2: Subgrid 1
    - Example 3: Subgrid 0
    - Example 4: Subgrid 2
4. The selected 3x3 subgrid is the output.
