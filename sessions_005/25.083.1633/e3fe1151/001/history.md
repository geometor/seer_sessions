Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are rectangular grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   **Dominant Color:** The color 7 (orange) appears to be a background or static element, forming a large contiguous block in all examples.
*   **Target Pixels:** Pixels *not* of color 7 seem to be the focus of the transformation.
*   **Symmetry:** There's a strong sense of symmetry, both horizontal and vertical, in how the non-7 pixels are arranged. The transformation preserves much, but perhaps not all, of this symmetry.
*   **Potential Action:** The transformation appears to involve changes *specifically* within the non-7 pixels, leaving color 7 untouched. The changes are a very local substitution.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - dominant_color: 7

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - dominant_color: 7

  - name: non_7_pixels
    type: pixel set
    properties:
      - colors: excludes 7
      - locations: variable
      - symmetry:  horizontal and vertical (approximate)

actions:
  - name: substitution
    description: replace select pixels not equaling 7
    context:  only pixels not of color 7 are changed

relationships:
  - type: symmetry
    objects: [non_7_pixels, non_7_pixels]
    description: Non-7 pixels in both input and output maintain an approximate, central-axis reflective symmetry.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Background:** Recognize that color 7 (orange) forms the unchanging background of the grid.

2.  **Locate Targets:** Focus on the pixels *not* colored 7.

3. **Substitution rule**:
    *   Within each row, going outwards from the central column, and going outwards from the central row, going outwards from the central row/column, change non-7 pixels according to these rules:
    *    check pixels above and below the center, left and right of center:
        *   upper left quad: `1->5, 8->0, 4->4, 3->3`.
        *   upper right quad: `8->0, 1->5, 4->4, 3->4`.
        *   lower left quad: `8->0, 1->5, 4->4, 3->4`.
        *   lower right quad: `8->5, 1->0, 5->4, 4->3`.
    *   center row:
    *   center column:

4.  **Preserve Background:** Do not modify any pixels of color 7.

5.  **Output:** Create the output grid with the substituted pixel values, maintaining the original positions of all pixels.
