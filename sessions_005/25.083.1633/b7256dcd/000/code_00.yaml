facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), each representing a color.
  - observation: Color 7 (orange) appears to be a dominant background or frame color in both examples.
  - observation_1: In example 1, color 6 (magenta) changes to color 3 (green).
  - observation_2: The changed 6s are in a horizontal line touching the top edge.
  - observation_3: The 6s are replaced by the color of the immediate right neighbor
  - observation_4: In example 1, some instances of 3 changes to 7.
  - observation_5: The changed 3s are in a horizontal line touching the top edge, and are replaced by the color to the immediate left.
  - observation_6: In example 1, some instances of color 6 change to color 4 (yellow).
  - observation_7: These changed 6s form a horizontal line and are replaced by their immediate upward neighbor.
  - observation_8: In example 2, some instances of 7 change to 1.
  - observation_9: these 7s are in the same row as the 1.

  - hypothesis: Changes may be related to runs/sequences of specific colors.
  - hypothesis: Horizontal adjacency plays an important role in determining the changes
