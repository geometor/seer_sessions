The transformation doesn't introduce new colors or eliminate any existing ones present, its a permutation.\n*   The most striking feature is how the bottom row from input becomes the top row of the output, top row becomes bottom row of output and, middle row is transposed.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
