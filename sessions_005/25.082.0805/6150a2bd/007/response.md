"""
The transformation rotates the input grid 90 degrees clockwise. The colors remain associated with their original locations after the rotation, not with the cells in the rotated matrix.

1. **Rotation:** The entire grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. This means the top row becomes the rightmost column, the second row becomes the second-rightmost column, and so on. The original bottom row becomes the leftmost column.
2. **Color Preservation:** Each pixel's *original* color in the input grid is maintained after the rotation. The rotation affects *positions*, but the color at a cell's original coordinates in the input is what determines the color at the new position in the output. It's not a simple transposition of the matrix values; the colors are "carried" by the rotation of their initial locations.
