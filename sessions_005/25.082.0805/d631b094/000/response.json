The input grids seem to contain a single non-zero color value, surrounded by zeros (white). The output grid seems to be composed of only the non-zero color from the input grid, and the size/shape of the output depends on the number of occurrences of the non-zero colors, and not their locations.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
