The input is a grid of two rows, with each row containing a single, repeated digit.
The output grid is also made of two rows.
The first row of the output grid is created by alternating the digits from the first and second rows of the input grid.
The second row of the output grid is created by alternating the digits of the second and first row of the input. Specifically, take an element of the second input row, and element of the first input row, etc.
Combine the rows to form the output grid.
