            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the results and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly handles Example 3, but fails on Examples 1 and 2. The primary issue seems to be in how the propagation of the rightmost non-zero pixel occurs. The current logic propagates the value downwards and *then* to the left *within each subsequent row independently*. The correct behavior, as suggested by the examples, is to propagate downwards and to the left *from the original source point*, stopping only when a non-zero pixel is encountered *in the original input*. The code incorrectly fills leftward after already filling down.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Metrics:** Use code execution to verify pixel differences. Focus on identifying where the propagation logic deviates.\n2.  **YAML Facts:** Create a precise representation of the object (the rightmost non-zero pixel) and its actions (propagation downwards and leftwards, with the stopping condition).\n3.  **Natural Language Program Update:** Refocus on the *source* of the propagation, and the *original input* as the context for the stopping condition. Emphasize this distinction.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis (using code execution):**\n\n"
