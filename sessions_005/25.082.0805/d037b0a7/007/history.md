1.  **Identify Rightmost Non-zero Pixel:** For each row in the input grid, find the rightmost pixel that has a non-zero value.
2.  **Propagate Down and Left:** Starting from the identified pixel's position, propagate its value downwards to all subsequent rows in the same column.
3.  **Conditional Leftward Propagation:** In each row where the value was propagated downwards, propagate the value to the *left*, one cell at a time. Stop the leftward propagation when either:
    *   The beginning of the row is reached (column index 0).
    *   A cell with a non-zero value in the *original* input grid is encountered.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code performs well on the first example but fails on the second and third. The primary issue seems to be the leftward propagation. It stops correctly when encountering a non-zero pixel *in the original grid*, but it doesn't always fill the *correct* number of cells to the left. The filling sometimes goes too far. It looks like we need to rethink how the leftward filling is tied to the initially identified rightmost non-zero pixel. Specifically, leftward fill should only happen if there is a non-zero pixel downwards.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Gather Metrics:** I'll use code execution to double-check pixel differences and confirm my initial assessment quantitatively. I'll also check the input grids.
2.  **Refine Observations:** Based on the metrics, I'll re-examine the relationship between the rightmost pixel and the leftward filling, looking for patterns that explain the discrepancies.
3.  **Update YAML and Natural Language Program:** I will update the YAML with facts to account for the new information. I will rephrase the natural language program to precisely define the downward and leftward propagation rules, ensuring it's consistent with *all* examples.

**Gather Metrics (Code Execution):**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate through Rows:** Process each row of the input grid sequentially, from top to bottom.
2.  **Find Rightmost Non-zero Pixel:** In the current row, identify the rightmost pixel with a non-zero value.
3.  **Propagate Downwards:** If a rightmost non-zero pixel is found, copy its value to all cells directly below it in the same column, for all subsequent rows.
4. **Conditional Leftward Propogation:**
    For each row *below* the one where the rightmost non-zero pixel was originally found, check the cell filled in by propogation down.
    Propagate *that* value to the left one at at time stopping if:
        The beginning of the row is reached.
        A non-zero pixel exists in the original input grid
