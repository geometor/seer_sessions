The output grid appears to consist of a single, repeated digit taken from the input grid. The core challenge is to determine *which* digit from the input grid is selected for replication in the output grid. It does not appear to involve object manipulation in a spatial sense (like moving or combining objects). No colors appear important, only their values.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
