  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - height: varies (5 in the examples)
      - width: varies (5 in the examples)

  - transformation_rule:
    - description: Replace '5' pixels with colors based on their column and row position.
    - details:
      - input_value: 5
      - output_value: Determined by a column-specific, row-repeating color sequence.
      - columns:
          0: [4, 2, 6] # Colors repeat for each subsequent row
          1: [0] # all inputs in col 1 were value 0
          2: [2, 6, 1]
          3: [0] # all inputs in col 3 were value 0
          4: [1, 4, 6]
      - zeros: Remain unchanged (value 0).
