facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Contains 0s and 5s.
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Contains 0s and colors corresponding to the positions of 5s in the input grid's first row. All rows are identical.
  - property: color_mapping
    description: A mapping from the column index of a '5' in the input grid's first row to a specific color in the output grid.
  - action: transform
    description: Replaces 5s in the input grid with colors based on their column index, according to a predefined color mapping, and makes all rows of the output grid identical.
  - observation: first_row_determines_output
    description: The presence of 5s in the first row of the input_grid dictates the color pattern for the entire output_grid.
  - observation: all_rows_identical
    description: all rows in output are identical.
  - observation: column_color_mapping
    description: mapping between columns and colors is fixed, and specific to this task.
