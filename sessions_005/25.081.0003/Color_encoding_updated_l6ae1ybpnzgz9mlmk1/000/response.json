'0' represents white, and '5' represents gray. The gray pixels form different patterns in each example.\n*   **Output Grids:** The output grids are also 5x5 matrices. They contain digits '0', '1', '2', '4', and '6'. '0' is white, '1' is blue, '2' is red, '4' is yellow, and '6' is magenta. Crucially, the output grids always have the same pattern: a repeating sequence of magenta/red/blue/yellow, with '0' (white) in the positions where the input was '0'.\n* **The Transformation:** It seems like the '5's in the input are replaced based on their column position, and the zeros stay zeros. I need a better system to say what the transformation is.\n\n**YAML Documentation**\n\n"
