The colors involved seem to be primarily yellow (4), red (2), black (0), and a new color azure (8) appears in the output. There's a strong suggestion of spatial relationships and object manipulation. Specifically, it seems like the transformation involves an interaction between the yellow (4) and red (2) pixels.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
