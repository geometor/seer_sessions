            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program and a YAML fact sheet.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code have significant flaws. The core idea of identifying yellow and red pixels and using them to define a region for transformation is partially correct, but the implementation misses several critical aspects, especially when it doesn't create correct connectivity. The initial assumption that yellow forms the start and end bounds is a good start. The code also does not yet handle columns correctly.\n\nThe provided code attempts to perform the transformations row-wise *and* column-wise, separately. It doesn't combine the row and column information properly to form coherent shapes, or the overall \"maze\" pattern. There are multiple failures that demonstrate that the current approach is not correct, in the results of the tests.\n\nThe strategy to resolve these issues will involve:\n\n1.  **Re-evaluating Object Relationships:** Instead of thinking strictly in terms of row and column ranges defined by yellows, we need to consider paths, connected components, or \"walls\" formed by the non-black pixels.\n2.  **Connectivity:** The core concept is creating \"walls\" or paths. The transformation involves changing reds to azures to \"complete\" the walls between yellows, ensuring connectivity and creating enclosed regions (or a maze-like structure).\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:** We will need to use both examples to iteratively build and test the updated natural language program and the resulting code. It might be helpful to visually represent paths and examine properties such as connectivity between yellow pixels.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution when necessary)**\n\nLet's examine the provided examples more closely.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   Input: 5x5 grid. Yellow (4) pixels at (0,0) and (4,3). Red (2) pixels scattered.\n*   Expected Output: Shows a connected \"wall\" of azure (8) pixels forming an L shape between yellows.\n*   Transformed Output: Incorrect. Only a few red pixels changed to azure. Fails to create connections along rows or columns, and doesn't do it consistently.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   Input: 5x5 grid. Yellow (4) pixels at (0,0) and (4,4). Red (2) pixels scattered.\n*   Expected Output: Shows a connected \"wall\" of azure (8) pixels that looks like a wider L shape with projections.\n*   Transformed Output: Incorrect, similar issues as Example 1. No connectivity established.\n\nThe outputs clearly do not match the examples, due to not correctly finding the area to transform.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet**\n\n"
