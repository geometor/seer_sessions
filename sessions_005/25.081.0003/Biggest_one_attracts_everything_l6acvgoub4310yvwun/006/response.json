This approach is partially correct but fails to account for a crucial aspect of the transformation: the specific rearrangement of non-zero digits *within* the non-empty rows. The current implementation simply preserves the original order of non-zero digits within each row, while the examples show they are being reordered and sometimes even merged. The strategy must therefore focus on understanding the *intra-row* transformations, in addition to the row-shifting.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Intra-Row Transformations:** Carefully examine how the non-zero digits within each row are reordered in the output compared to the input. Look for patterns related to position, color, or other properties. Specifically look for the merging of colors, and consider mirroring.\n2.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program to incorporate the observed intra-row transformation rules.\n3.  **Modify Code:** Adapt the Python code to implement the refined transformation logic, paying close attention to how digits within each row are handled.\n4.  **Iterative Testing:** Test the revised code against all available examples and repeat the analysis and refinement process until all examples are matched correctly.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection):**\n\n"
