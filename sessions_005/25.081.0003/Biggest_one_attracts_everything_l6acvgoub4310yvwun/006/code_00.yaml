examples:

      - Row 2 (8 8 0 5 0) becomes (8 8 5 0 0). The 5 moved from index 3 to index 2.
      - Row 3 (8 8 0 5 0) becomes (8 8 5 0 0). The 5 moved from index 3 to index 2.
      - Row 5 (0 7 0 0 0) becomes (0 7 0 0 0), unchanged.
      - Non-zero digits are rearranged; zero digits pad other positions.
      - There appears to be merging of some digits
    discrepancies:
      - The non-zero digits aren't correctly repositioned within the rows.

  - example_id: 2
    input_grid_shape: (5, 5)
    output_grid_shape: (5, 5)
    observations: |
      - Row 1 (8 0 7 7 7) becomes (0 8 7 7 7) - 8 moves to after the 0s to its right, which is consistent with the rule.
      - Row 3 (0 0 4 0 0) becomes (0 0 4 0 6). The last non-zero value appears in the position of the final 0.
      - Row 4/5 (0 0 0 0 6) are unchanged, then combined/merged
      - There appears to be merging of some digits
    discrepancies:
      - The non-zero digits aren't correctly repositioned within the rows.

  - example_id: 3
    input_grid_shape: (5, 5)
    output_grid_shape: (5, 5)
    observations: |
        - Row 1: (0 7 7 7 0) is unchanged.
        - Row 3: (0 9 9 9 0) is unchanged.
        - Row 4: (0 9 9 9 6) is unchanged.
      - There appears to be merging of some digits
    discrepancies:
        - Non-empty rows are moved to top, but they are not merged.
