"""
The program identifies pixels with the value 5 (gray) or 6 (magenta). It then iterates through these pixels, checking if they have neighboring pixels (up, down, left, and right). If a gray or magenta pixel neighbors a zero pixel on opposite sides, then that gray or magenta pixel should transform to a zero pixel. If the conditions are not met, the pixel retains its original value.

Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial code was based on the idea of removing gray (5) and magenta (6) pixels that had opposing zero neighbors. This worked partially but failed to capture the complete transformation rule, leading to errors in all three test examples. The errors vary in nature: some involve incorrect removal of pixels, while others involve missing removals or incorrect color changes. This indicates that the neighborhood rule needs refinement and that the transformation logic is more complex than the presence of adjacent zeros.

The main strategy will involve looking at pairs of example inputs and outputs side by side, focusing on understanding the transformation of the gray/magenta pixels in the center regions.

**Metrics and Observations (using visual inspection and existing results):**

Here, I'll create a summary of each example, focusing on object-level changes, color changes, size, and any specific patterns, keeping in mind the pixel off count from the original code result.

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** A grid with gray and magenta pixels, some surrounded by zeros.
*   **Expected Output:** Gray and magenta pixels are removed based on their neighbors.
*   **Transformed Output (from code):**  Incorrectly removes some, but not all, of the gray and magenta pixels that are in a straight line with white pixels.
*   **Pixels Off:** 6
*   **Observations:** The rule applied (removing gray/magenta pixels between zeros) is too simplistic.
    - There are gray pixels, two of them are between white, which are replaced by white
    - The magenta becomes gray in line 2, column 2
    - The rule has problems because it is not handling magenta in line 4 properly

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** Another grid with gray and magenta pixels.
*   **Expected Output:** More complex removal of pixels and some of the magenta colors become gray.
*   **Transformed Output (from code):**  Does not follow the expected output. Incorrectly changes many gray pixels to white and fails to handle the magenta to gray changes.
*    **Pixels Off:** 6
*   **Observations:** Reinforces the need for a more sophisticated neighbor and color-checking rule.
    - Magenta at the bottom right of the gray pixels change to gray, others are removed.
    - The central gray pixels are removed.
    - The other gray pixels on the edge of the image are not removed.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** Grid with gray and magenta, including a block of magenta.
*   **Expected Output:** Block shapes remain in parts, others are removed.
*   **Transformed Output (from code):** Does not handle the magenta pixels at all.
*   **Pixels Off:** 7
*   **Observations:** The current logic fails significantly here, highlighting its inability to deal with solid blocks of gray/magenta.
    - Magenta in a large block will turn to gray
    - Magenta with any neighboring white, connected vertically or horizontally, are removed
    - Gray is removed when connecting to white pixels vertically or horizontally.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      color: [white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon]
      value: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
      neighbors: [up, down, left, right]
    actions:
      - change_color:
          conditions:
            - if color is magenta and is part of a 2x2 or larger same-color block:
                change to gray
            - if color is gray or magenta and connects to white pixels vertically or horizontally, change to white.
      - remove:
          conditions: [] # removal is covered in change_color to white

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Connected Components:** Find all connected components (groups of adjacent pixels of the same color).
2. **Process Gray/Magenta:**
     - Examine each pixel within gray (5) or magenta (6) colored components.
     - **Magenta Block Rule**: If a magenta pixel is part of a 2x2 block or larger, it turns gray.
     - **Magenta/Gray Removal:**  If a magenta/gray pixel is connected to white pixels vertically or horizontally, remove it (change to white).

This natural language program takes into account the connected nature of pixels and the special behavior of magenta blocks, while also handling non-block pixels and edges differently. It builds upon the original neighbor idea but refines it significantly by checking whether they are connecting to each other and by checking for the magenta block shape.
