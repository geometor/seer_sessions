            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the natural language program and subsequently the code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program described a \"waterfall\" effect where yellow pixels propagate downwards. The code attempted to implement this, but the results show it failed on all three training examples. The core issue seems to be a misunderstanding of *when* the propagation stops. The original description states propagation stops \"at the bottom edge of the grid or one row below a row containing yellow.\" The code's logic is flawed in its implementation of the \"one row below\" condition. It also appears to have an issue where it is propagating based on the presense of any yellow in a row.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine each example's input, expected output, and the (incorrect) actual output produced by the current code. We need to pinpoint *exactly* where the code's behavior deviates from the expected behavior. Specifically looking at where the yellow *should* have propagated but didn't, or where it propagated incorrectly. Use the `tool_code` block to check if the sizes of the input, output and expected output all match.\n2.  **Refine Stopping Condition:** The \"one row below a row containing yellow\" rule needs to be clarified. Does it mean the *entire* row must be filled, or any yellow will stop *all* columns? It would help to determine this for each output.\n3.  **Column-Specific Logic:** The propagation needs to be handled on a column-by-column basis. The presence of yellow in one column shouldn't directly affect another column's propagation.\n4.  **Iterative Improvement:** Start by updating the natural language program to more accurately describe the observed transformation. Then, modify the code to reflect these changes. Test after *each* significant code modification.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Analyze Examples:**\n\nLet's use code execution to gather more precise information about the mismatches.\n\n"

Otherwise, skip to the next column.\n4.  **Propagation:**\n    *   Iterate downwards, starting from the top row.\n    *   If you encounter existing yellow, propagate it to next lower row.\n    *   Propagation stops when either:\n        *   The bottom row of the grid is reached.\n        *  The row immediately below a row that already has yellow color anywhere, is reached\n\n**Explanation and Improvements Based on Metrics:**\n\nThe `tool_code` output provides crucial insights:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The code correctly identifies the initial yellow pixel but fails to propagate to columns 1 and 3 in row 4. This confirms the issue isn't simply about finding the yellow pixels, but in the propagation logic that should fill other columns.\n*   **Example 2:**  Similar to Example 1, propagation fails in the last row, this time for the first and the fifth column.\n*   **Example 3:** Propagation does not begin because the code has no special treatment for an entire row of yellow.\n\nThe key misunderstanding in the previous code was how the stopping condition related to rows containing yellow. The previous interpretation was that a yellow pixel in *any* column of a row should stop propagation in a given column if it encountered that row. The correct behavior (observed in the examples) stops a column's propagation when it is *immediately below a row containing any yellow*.\n\nThe refined natural language program now explicitly states this column-wise, \"one-row-below\" stopping condition. The propagation happens on the next row immediately after a row having at least one yellow.\n"
