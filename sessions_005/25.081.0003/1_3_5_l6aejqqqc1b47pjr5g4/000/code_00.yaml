facts:
  - observation: Grids are rectangular arrays of integers.
  - observation: Integers represent colors.
  - observation: '0' represents white, '4' represents yellow.
  - object: Yellow_pixels: Identifiable by value '4'.
  - action: Yellow_pixels propagate downwards.
  - constraint: Propagation stops at the bottom edge of the grid.
    constraint_alternate_condition: Propagation also stops one row beyond a row which contains a yellow pixel.
  - relationship: Output grid dimensions are identical to input grid dimensions.
