      - "If a column contains only white above the 'control_row', it will be filled with azure up to the control row EXCEPT where there is azure below in the SAME column"
      - "If a column contains a non-white color, other logic may apply (to be determined)."
      - "Where azure exists in a column BELOW the 'control_row', the output will be white in the intersection with a column that would otherwise be azure"
