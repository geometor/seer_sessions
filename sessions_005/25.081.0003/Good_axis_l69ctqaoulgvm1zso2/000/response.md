Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves manipulating a grid of colored pixels. The colors involved seem to be primarily red (2), white (0), orange (7), and azure (8). The core operation appears to be some form of replacement or movement of azure and white pixels based on their positions relative to other colors. Specifically, a horizontal line of azure seems to control change in white columns above it.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Contains pixels of different colors.
  - name: pixel
    type: element
    properties:
      color:
        type: integer
        values: [0, 2, 7, 8]  # white, red, orange, azure
      position:
        type: tuple
        description: (row, column) coordinates

actions:
  - name: replace_column
    description:  Replaces white pixels in a column with azure pixels under specific conditions

relationships:
 - name: azure_control
   description: Columns containing azure pixels below row with all red trigger the replacement in columns containing only white pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Control Row:** Locate the row that contains only red (2) pixels except the last entry.
2.  **Identify Target Columns:** Examine the columns.
3. **Apply the Rule**: Find the columns that are fully white.
4. **Replacement:** Find the azure pixels on the same column as red pixels in the identified control row and set to white the intersection of the white columns and the azure columns. Replace the white pixels in the identified columns with azure pixels, up to the row immediately above the red row identified initially.
5. Preserve bottom row

In summary the azure pixels take the place of white pixels in any all white column, but only up to (and including) the columns where the all-red row has red pixels, and only to the row above the all red row.
