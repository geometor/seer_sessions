"""
Replaces white pixels above a "control row" with azure based on the colors in the control row. The control row is defined as a row containing mostly red pixels and exactly one other color.  If a column contains a white pixel above the control row, and the control row has red in that column, the white pixel is changed to azure. If the control row contains a non-red color in that column, the output has a white cell. If there is azure beneath the control row in that column, the white pixels above the control row become white.
