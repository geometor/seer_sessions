Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves manipulating 2D grids of colored pixels. The primary elements are:

*   **Background:** The white (0) pixels seem to form a background.
*   **Horizontal Shapes:** There are horizontal lines or rectangles of a single, non-white color within each input grid.
*    **Outer Edge Pixels**: There are pixels that define the outer edge of the object.
*   **Color Changes**: Specific, single pixels seem to shift position and/or change their color.  The transformation seems to focus on moving and sometimes combining color from the edge pixels on the outer perimeter of the object.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Each input grid contains a single horizontal shape of uniform, non-white color.
  - observation: |
      The horizontal shapes are surrounded by white (0) pixels.
  - observation: |
     The height of the non-white object is always 3.
  - observation: |
      The transformation focuses on single pixels located at the edges of the shape, specifically the last row of the surrounding white space.
  - observation: |
      The last row of the input can have 1 or 2 non-white pixels, always at the edge.
  - observation: |
      In train_1, a magenta (6) pixel replaces a white pixel above an existing red (2).
  - observation: |
       In train_1, a red (2) pixel replaces a white pixel.
  - observation: |
      In train_2, the two orange (7) are removed, and the azure object moves up.
  - observation: |
    In train_3, a yellow (4) and a red (2) pixel stay in the same place.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Object:** Find the contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels.
2.  **Identify the edge pixels:** Locate the non-white pixels on the outer edge, specifically the last row, of the object.
3. **Process Each Edge Pixel**:
   * if there are two edge pixels, as in Train 2, remove them.
   * if there is one edge pixel, as in train_1 and train_3, remove the last row and, working from left to right, place the edge pixel at the position of its column.
4.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.

Essentially, the transformation rule seems to be:

Locate the edge pixels in the last row, copy them, remove the last row and paste
the copied pixels into that column.
