Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize for improvement.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code have a fundamental flaw: they insert orange pixels *adjacent* to the green block, but not specifically *within* the same row as the original green block. The code modifies *every* row containing a green pixel by placing orange pixels to the left and right of the entire green block *regardless* of the overall shape*. The examples show this leads to an expanding block of orange pixels. The core issue is a misinterpretation of "wrapping" in the context of rows containing green pixels vs. a shape-based wrapping.

The expected outputs show that only the rows where green pixels initiate and terminate changes. Intermediate rows do not change. The strategy is to refine the logic to target only the *start and end rows* of contiguous blocks of rows containing green.

**Gather Metrics and Analysis (Code Execution)**

Since visual comparison highlights the issue, and the color palette and size are correct, I'll focus on the row indices. I will add helper functions that helps identify row and column indexes of specific colors.


``` python
import numpy as np

def find_color_rows(grid, color):
    """Finds the row indices where a specific color exists."""
    return [i for i, row in enumerate(grid) if color in row]

def find_color_columns_in_row(grid, row_index, color):
    """Finds the column indices of a specific color within a given row."""
    return [j for j, pixel in enumerate(grid[row_index]) if pixel == color]

def analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    """Analyzes an example and reports relevant indices."""
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)
    transformed_output = np.array(transformed_output)

    green_rows_input = find_color_rows(input_grid, 3)
    orange_rows_expected = find_color_rows(expected_output, 7)
    orange_rows_transformed = find_color_rows(transformed_output, 7)

    print(f"Green Rows (Input): {green_rows_input}")
    print(f"Orange Rows (Expected): {orange_rows_expected}")
    print(f"Orange Rows (Transformed): {orange_rows_transformed}")

    if len(orange_rows_expected) > 0:  # avoid errors if the lists are empty
       for r_idx in orange_rows_expected:
            orange_cols_expected = find_color_columns_in_row(expected_output,r_idx, 7)
            print(f"Orange columns in row {r_idx} (Expected) {orange_cols_expected}")

    if len(orange_rows_transformed) >0:
        for r_idx in orange_rows_transformed:
            orange_cols_transformed = find_color_columns_in_row(transformed_output,r_idx,7)
            print(f"Orange columns in row {r_idx} (Transformed) {orange_cols_transformed}")

**YAML Facts**


```yaml

  - object: green_block
    properties:
      color: green (3)
      shape: contiguous_rows
      start_row: row_index of the first row containing green
      end_row: row_index of the last row containing green
    actions:
      - type: wrap
        details: Add orange pixels to the left and right of the green block ONLY on the start and end rows.
        color: orange (7)

  - object: other_rows
    properties:
      color: varies
      shape: row
    actions:
      - type: preserve
        details: Rows not containing the start/end of the green block remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify** the *start row* and *end row* of a contiguous block of rows containing green (3) pixels. A contiguous block is defined as one or more consecutive rows, each containing at least one green pixel.
2.  **For the start row**:
    *   Insert an orange (7) pixel to the immediate left of the leftmost green (3) pixel.
    *   Insert an orange (7) pixel to the immediate right of the rightmost green (3) pixel.
3.  **For the end row**:
    *   Insert an orange (7) pixel to the immediate left of the leftmost green (3) pixel.
    *   Insert an orange (7) pixel to the immediate right of the rightmost green (3) pixel.
4.  **All other rows** in the output grid remain identical to the input grid.
