Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Objects:** The primary object is a rectangular block of green (3) pixels. There are also background pixels of white (0). We also perceive an introduction of orange (7) pixels.
*   **Spatial Relationships:** The green block maintains its shape and size. The orange pixels appear to be inserted to the left and right of the existing green block's columns.
*   **Transformations:** The core transformation seems to be an insertion or wrapping of the green object with orange pixels, happening only on the rows that contain the original green object. It's a column-wise conditional insertion.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: green_block
    type: rectangle
    color: green (3)
    properties:
      - contiguous: true
      - shape: constant

  - name: orange_insertions
    type: column_elements
    color: orange (7)
    properties:
      - position: left and right of green_block
      - conditional: "present only on rows with green_block"
      
  - name: background
    type: background_fill
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - unchanged: true

transformations:
  - type: conditional_insertion
    agent: orange_insertions
    target: green_block rows
    action: "add orange(7) pixels to the immediate left and right of green(3) columns on rows containing green(3)"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all rows in the input grid that contain green (3) pixels.
2.  **For each** of these identified rows:
    *   **Insert** an orange (7) pixel to the immediate left of the leftmost green (3) pixel in that row.
    *   **Insert** an orange (7) pixel to the immediate right of the rightmost green (3) pixel in that row.
3. **All other** rows of the output grid are the same as in the input grid.

In summary, the input grid's green block is "wrapped" with orange pixels on each row where the green object is present. Rows without any green pixels are copied over to the output unchanged.
