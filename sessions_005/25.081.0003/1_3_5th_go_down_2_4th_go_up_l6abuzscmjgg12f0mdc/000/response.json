            "text": "Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and try to discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Grids:** The input and output are both 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.\n*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of the same color can be considered objects.\n*   **Symmetry:** There's a strong suggestion of a symmetrical transformation, potentially a reflection or rotation of some sort. Visualizing the changes, I have a strong expectation about diagonal mirroring.\n*    **Non-Zero Values:** The non-zero values seem to be the key elements undergoing transformation, while the zeros act as a background or empty space.\n*   **Object Interactions:** Some colored objects will interact with the diagonal line and others will simply be moved.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Pixels that were originally '0' (white/empty) remain '0' in the output.\n\nEssentially the values are being reflected across the main diagonal, creating a mirror image below the diagonal, and stacking the values if there are any overlaps from the input in the transformed position.\n"
