Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the idea of shifting yellow pixels down and extending the yellow color upwards. However, the results clearly show this isn't the correct transformation rule. The transformed outputs consistently fill *all* spaces above the original yellow pixels with yellow, and the original yellow pixels are not being shifted, they are just being filled above. The expected outputs show a different pattern: the yellow appears to be "bubbling up" from its initial position, extending upwards one row at a time, but only *within* a continuous block of zeros, constrained by existing yellow pixels. The bottom row of yellow is an anchor.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Examples:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example. Focus on how the yellow pixels *actually* change, not how we initially *thought* they would.
2.  **Identify Key Differences:** Quantify the differences between the expected and transformed outputs. This will help pinpoint the errors in the current logic.
3.  **Refine the Rule:** Based on the analysis, develop a more accurate natural language program that describes the *observed* transformation.
4. **Focus on vertical movement**: Note how each column transforms independently.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

I will use a simplified approach, as the previous code execution gave us visual feedback which is very useful.

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** Yellow progresses down the columns 0, 4, 4, 4, 4.
*   **Expected Output:** Yellow fills upwards, stopping one short of the top, then extends upwards, stopping at boundaries and filling between.
*   **Transformed Output:** All positions above any yellow became yellow.
*   **Observation**: Only zeros above a yellow block become yellow in the next row up, as long as they are surrounded by existing zeros.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** Yellow starts higher and has a similar shape, on a black background.
*   **Expected Output:** Similar "fill upwards" pattern, but contained to the existing column structure and stopping at boundaries and filling between.
*  **Transformed output**: same error as before

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** Two columns of yellow, with different starting positions.
*   **Expected output**: The transformation fills upwards to the previous row of yellow in each column, but not beyond.
*   **Transformed output:** All positions above existing yellow blocks became yellow, regardless of column structure.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Contains pixels of different colors.
  - name: yellow_pixel
    type: pixel
    color: yellow (4)
    properties:
      - anchored: bottom row
      - extends_upward: true
  - name: zero_pixel
    type: pixel
    color: black(0)
    properties:
      - can_be_filled: True

actions:
  - name: fill_upward
    description: >-
      Yellow pixels extend upwards in each column, replacing black (0) pixels
      one row at a time.
    constraints:
      - bottom_row_anchored: Yellow pixels in the bottom row remain unchanged.
      - extends_within_zeros_only: Extends upwards only replaces zeros
      - extends_one_row_up: extension occurs into an adjacent zero-value cell
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Columns:** The transformation occurs independently within each column of the grid.
2.  **Bottom Row Anchor:** Yellow pixels in the bottom row of the grid remain unchanged.
3. **Fill upwards one layer**: For each column, for yellow blocks not in the bottom row, a single zero-valued cell adjacent to and *above* a yellow pixel becomes yellow.
4. **Repeat**: No further modifications are done.
