"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous groups of pixels with color 3 (green), color 1 (blue), and color 4 (yellow). Each of these groups is considered an object.
2.  **Remove Blue and Yellow Objects:** Delete all blue and yellow objects.
3.  **Transform Green Objects**: The green objects are not always moved to the top left, nor are they flattened into a horizontal line. There appears to be a pattern to the re-arrangement.
    *   In Example 1, the green objects retain their original positions in the output.
    *   In Example 2, the large green object is converted to a 3x1 vertical line, plus one additional point.
    *   In Example 3: the 2x1 horizontal object is split.
4.  **Output:** The final grid will consist of the transformed green objects, while all other cells become 0 (white). The transformation of green seems to involve splitting into component parts and potentially re-arranging those.
