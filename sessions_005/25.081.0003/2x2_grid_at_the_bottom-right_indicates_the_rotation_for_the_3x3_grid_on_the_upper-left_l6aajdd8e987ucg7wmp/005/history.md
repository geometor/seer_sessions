1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of color 3 (green),
    color 1 (blue) and color 4 (yellow) pixels.
2.  **Object-3 Transformation:** Move the object-3 (green) to the top-left corner of the grid, making
    it a horizontal line if longer than 1. Maintain the relative positions of the green pixels.
3.  **Object-1 and Object-4 Removal:** Remove the blue 2x1 object (object-1)

4.  **Output:** The resulting grid contains the repositioned object-3
    and 0 for the previous positions of all other objects.

Okay, here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the natural language program and subsequently the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the generated code have several shortcomings, as evidenced by the failed test cases. The core issues are:

1.  **Incorrect Object-3 Placement:** The code places all green (color 3) pixels in the top row, regardless of their original relative positions. It doesn't preserve the shape or relative positions within the green objects. The examples show that segments of green stay together.
2.  **Incorrect Blue and Yellow Handling:** The instructions to eliminate blue (color 1) and yellow (color 4) are not conditional on being a specific shape or adjacent.
3. **Incorrect Interpretation of shapes:** It appears green objects can be more than one row tall.

The strategy to address these issues involves:

1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Improve the object identification to preserve the original shape of object 3 (green).
2. **Conditional Object Removal:** Remove blue and yellow only if they are in the specified shapes.
3. **Shape and Relative Position Preservation:** Ensure object 3 (green) segments maintain their relative positions and shapes when moved.

**Metrics and Observations**

I'll examine each example pair, comparing the input, expected output, and transformed output, noting key discrepancies to collect data for updating the natural language program.

*Example 1*


```
Input:
3 3 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 0 0
0 0 0 1 4
0 0 0 1 1

Expected Output:
3 3 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0

Transformed Output:
3 3 3 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```


-   **Observation:** The two separate green objects (3) in the input should remain separated in the output. The transformed output incorrectly combines them. The 2x1 blue object and single yellow object were removed.

*Example 2*


```
Input:
0 0 0 0 0
0 3 0 0 0
3 3 3 0 0
0 0 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 4

Expected Output:
3 0 0 0 0
3 3 0 0 0
3 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0

Transformed Output:
3 3 3 3 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```


-   **Observation:** The 3x1 and 1x1 green objects should stay in those relative positions and shape, but the transformed output extends the green across the entire top row. The 2x1 blue and single yellow object were correctly removed.

*Example 3*


```
Input:
0 0 0 0 0
3 3 0 0 0
0 0 3 0 0
0 0 0 1 1
0 0 0 4 1

Expected Output:
3 0 0 0 0
0 3 3 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0

Transformed Output:
3 3 3 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```


-   **Observation:** The two green components (a 1x2 and a 1x1 object) in the input have distinct shapes, and this should be maintained after the move. The 1x2 blue and the single yellow should be removed.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: 1
    color: 3  # Green
    description: Can be multiple disconnected components of varying shapes and sizes.  Moves to top-left, maintaining shape and relative positioning of segments.
  - id: 2
    color: 1  # Blue
    description: Appears as 2x1, is removed.
  - id: 3
    color: 4  # Yellow
    description: Appears as a 1x1 next to the blue object, and is also removed.

actions:
  - description: "Move all disconnected components of object-1 (green) to the top-left of the grid, preserving their original shapes and relative positioning of components. Fill empty space with 0 after moving."
  - description: "Remove object-2 and object-3 (if present)."
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Green Components:** Locate all disconnected green (color 3) components in the input grid. Each separate contiguous block of green pixels is a distinct component.

2.  **Reposition Green Components:** Move each identified green component to the top-left region of the output grid.
    *   Maintain the original shape of each green component.
    *   Preserve the relative vertical and horizontal positions *between* the green components. Start placing at (0,0), and subsequent components are positioned relative to the already placed ones, matching the relative positioning they had in the input.
    *   After moving the green components, fill the positions that used to have a green object with black pixels (value 0).

3.  **Identify and Remove Blue and Yellow Objects:**
    *   Locate a 2x1 block of blue (color 1) pixels.
    *   Locate a single yellow (color 4) pixel directly adjacent to the 2x1 blue block.
    *   Remove both the identified blue and yellow objects by setting the pixel to 0.

4. **Output Grid:** The output grid should contain the repositioned green components and zeros in all other cells.
