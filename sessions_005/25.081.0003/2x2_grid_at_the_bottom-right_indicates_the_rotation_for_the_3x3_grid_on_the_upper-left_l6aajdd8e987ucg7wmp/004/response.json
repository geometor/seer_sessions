            "text": "Okay, here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the natural language program and subsequently the code.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code have several shortcomings, as evidenced by the failed test cases. The core issues are:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Object-3 Placement:** The code places all green (color 3) pixels in the top row, regardless of their original relative positions. It doesn't preserve the shape or relative positions within the green objects. The examples show that segments of green stay together.\n2.  **Incorrect Blue and Yellow Handling:** The instructions to eliminate blue (color 1) and yellow (color 4) are not conditional on being a specific shape or adjacent.\n3. **Incorrect Interpretation of shapes:** It appears green objects can be more than one row tall.\n\nThe strategy to address these issues involves:\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Improve the object identification to preserve the original shape of object 3 (green).\n2. **Conditional Object Removal:** Remove blue and yellow only if they are in the specified shapes.\n3. **Shape and Relative Position Preservation:** Ensure object 3 (green) segments maintain their relative positions and shapes when moved.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nI'll examine each example pair, comparing the input, expected output, and transformed output, noting key discrepancies to collect data for updating the natural language program.\n\n*Example 1*\n\n"
