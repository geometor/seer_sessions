objects:
  grid:
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: integer
      columns: integer
      cells: integer values (0-9 representing colors)
  last_row:
    type: 1D array (subset of grid)
    properties:
      index: rows - 1 (last row of the grid)
      values: integer values (0-9)
    role: base for transformation

actions:
  stacking:
    input: grid, last_row
    process: |
      Iterate through each column of the grid.
      For each column, examine the values from top to bottom (row 0 to rows - 2).
      If a zero is encountered in the 'last_row' at the current column,
      replace it with the first non-zero value found in that column from the preceding rows.
    output: modified last_row
