"""
The transformation operates on the input grid as follows: The output grid is initially a copy of the input grid. Only the last row of the output grid is modified. For each column, traverse the input grid from the first row to the second-to-last row. If a zero is found in the last row of the *output* grid at the current column, replace that zero with the first non-zero value found in the same column, searching from top to bottom in the preceding rows of the input grid. If no non-zero value is found, the zero remains. The other rows of the output grid should remain unchanged.

Essentially, the last row acts as a base, and non-zero values from the upper rows "stack" onto it, filling the zeros column by column, from top to bottom.
