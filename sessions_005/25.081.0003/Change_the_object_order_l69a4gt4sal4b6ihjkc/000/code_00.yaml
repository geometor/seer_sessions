facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The background color is consistently 0 (white).
  - observation: A color appears to fill adjacent positions from top-left to bottom-right, with a specific filling pattern in each row.
  - observation: The transformation seems to propagate colors based on their original position, with the highest color filling horizontally right and the next highest filling other positions in the column.
  - object_type: "contiguous color block"
    properties:
      - color: "integer value (0-9)"
      - shape: "irregular, determined by adjacent cells of same color"
      - position: "grid coordinates (row, column)"
    actions:
      - "filling: propagation of color to adjacent cells"
    relationships:
      - "adjacent_to: next to another color block"
