            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was designed to propagate the highest color in each row to the left, filling up positions to the left of its leftmost occurrence. However, the results across all three examples show a consistent mismatch. The code doesn't correctly implement the intended transformation. The generated outputs don't align with the expected outputs, specifically in how colors are propagated and arranged within each row. It seems to incorrectly propagate colors downward. It seems the main issue is the code fills from right to left, and not as intended in the expected outputs.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Transformation Rule:** The provided examples suggest a more complex rule than initially implemented. It is not just the highest that fills from the left. I will review examples and I will pay close attention to the order and direction of color propagation.\n2.  **Focus on Relative Position and Order:** It appears the transformation isn't solely based on the highest color, but on existing ordering and position of colours.\n3.  **Column-wise Operations:** The outputs make me think there is a relationship across columns, not just on rows.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nI'll use a simple manual analysis and visual comparison of the provided inputs, expected outputs, and transformed outputs. There are only 3 examples. I don't think I need a `tool_code` execution.\n\n**Example Analysis:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 5x5 grid with colors 2, 3, and 1.\n    *   Expected Output: Shows a propagation where colors fill positions to the left, but the order of the colours matters.\n    *   Transformed Output: Incorrectly propagates color 1 down\n    *   Mismatch: Significant differences in the propagation of colors.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 5x5 grid with colors 9, 8, and 6.\n    *   Expected Output: Shows a fill to the left, then down, then to the right.\n    *   Transformed Output: Incorrect propagation of the colours starting in row 2.\n    *   Mismatch: Color propagation is incorrect.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 5x5 grid with colors 2, 1, and 8.\n    *   Expected Output:fill to the left, then down, then to the right.\n    *   Transformed Output: Incorrectly fills the colors downward.\n    *   Mismatch: Significant deviations in color arrangements.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
