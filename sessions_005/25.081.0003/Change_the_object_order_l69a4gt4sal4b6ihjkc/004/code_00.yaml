facts:
  - observation: |
      The transformation propagates colors downwards within each column, starting from the original positions of colors in the input grid.
  - object_identification:
      - objects: "Individual colored pixels in the grid."
      - properties:
          - color: "The color value of the pixel (0-9)."
          - position: "The (row, column) coordinates of the pixel."
  - transformation_rule:
    - step_1: Iterate through each column of the input grid.
    - step_2: Within each column, identify the non-zero colored pixels present.
    - step_3:  For each non-zero color found in the column, propagate that color downwards from its original position in the input. If the color is blocked by an existing different color, propagation stops and begins again for the next color.
    - step_4:  Black (0) is not propagated.
