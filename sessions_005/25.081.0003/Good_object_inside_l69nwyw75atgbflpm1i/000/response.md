Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output pairs to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (5x5 in both examples).
*   The grids consist of single-digit integers representing colors.
*   The outer frame of the grid is always '6' (magenta).
*   The interior of the grid contains various colors.
*   The transformation seems to involve some form of pattern replication or modification within the interior of the grid, while the outer frame remains unchanged.
*    In example 1, the green and yellow pixels on rows 2 and 3 seem to cause a replication of row 2.
*	In example 2, the red, green and yellow pixels on row 2 seems to cause the same effect.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - frame_color: 6 (magenta)
      - interior_colors: [0, 2, 3, 4] (white, red, green, yellow)
    actions:
      - maintain_frame: The outer frame of color 6 is preserved.
      - replicate_row: Specific row in input's interior are replicated one or more times in the output.
    relationships:
      - row_replication_trigger: Some colors, other than magenta or white, initiate row replication.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve the Frame:** Keep the outer frame of the grid (color 6) unchanged in the output.
2.  **Identify non-white/magenta rows:** The first appearance of any combination of colors that are not white (0) or magenta (6)
3.  **Replicate identified row:** Duplicate the content, excluding the frame, down until another row that is not white is reached, or the last interior row.
