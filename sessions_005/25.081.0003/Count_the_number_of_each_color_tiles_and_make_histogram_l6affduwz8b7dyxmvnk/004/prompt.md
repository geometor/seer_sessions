The transformation rule involves re-arranging colored objects within the grid.
The objects are identified as contiguous blocks of the same color.
The transformation mirrors the input grid both vertically and horizontally and rotates anti-clockwise by 90 degrees.
The mirrored and rotated row objects are then placed in the output grid.
