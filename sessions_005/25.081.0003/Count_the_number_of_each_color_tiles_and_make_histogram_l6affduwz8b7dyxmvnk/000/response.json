Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.\n*   The input and output grids have the same dimensions.\n*   The transformation seems to involve re-arranging and potentially extending existing colored \"objects\" (contiguous blocks of the same color). There is color preservation but re-arrangement.\n* It appears the transformation rotates and flips, so the final output will be a rotated and mirror flipped.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The relative order is not easily described, but can be derived.\n4.  When placing colors, the last occurance encountered in the input, takes priority.\n\nIn summary, the input grid's color objects are re-arranged by rotating and mirroring, and then filled into the output grid, starting from the object in the top-left, and proceeding in the order generated by mirroring vertically, and horizontally, and rotating the grid anti-clockwise 90 degrees.\n"
