Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided examples and discern the transformation logic. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.
*   The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
*   The transformation seems to involve re-arranging and potentially extending existing colored "objects" (contiguous blocks of the same color). There is color preservation but re-arrangement.
* It appears the transformation rotates and flips, so the final output will be a rotated and mirror flipped.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5x5 (all examples)
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - type: object
    properties:
     - color: determined by cell value
     - shape: contiguous block of same-colored cells
     - can_move: True
     - can_expand: potentially, by merging with adjacent cells if a merge can be done by mirroring or rotating.

actions:
  - type: reorder
    description: Rearrange the input colored block objects, mirroring and rotating.
    parameters:
        - mirror: both vertically and horizontally
        - rotate: 90 degree anti-clockwise

relationships:
  - adjacency:  Objects next to each other.
  - color-based_grouping: pixels of the same color form an object.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of the same color in the input grid. Treat each of these as a separate object.
2.  **Mirror and Rotate**: Consider each row of pixels as an object.
3.  **Reconstruct:** Fill the output grid with the objects identified in step 1, re-arranged by rotating anti-clockwise 90 degrees, and mirror both vertically and horizontally. The relative order is not easily described, but can be derived.
4.  When placing colors, the last occurance encountered in the input, takes priority.

In summary, the input grid's color objects are re-arranged by rotating and mirroring, and then filled into the output grid, starting from the object in the top-left, and proceeding in the order generated by mirroring vertically, and horizontally, and rotating the grid anti-clockwise 90 degrees.
