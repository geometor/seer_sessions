facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of the same dimensions.
    dimensions: variable
    elements: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors.

  - type: object
    description: Each non-zero pixel can be considered an individual object.
    properties:
      color: determined by the integer value (1-9).
      position: row and column index in the grid.

  - type: transformation
    description: Some non-zero pixels might change their horizontal position, based on a rule.
    details:
      - rule_type: horizontal swap or shift.
      - condition: It seems only to happen for specific pairs of pixels within a row, possibly adjacent, or horizontally aligned with others.
      - constraints: The overall grid dimensions remain unchanged.
