The transformation seems to involve a subtle change in the position or value of some, but possibly not all, colored pixels, while keeping other colored pixels and the overall grid dimensions constant. The zeros (white pixels) seem to act like a background. The key challenge is figuring out the rule that guides colored pixel modifications. It appears like some pixels swap their positions horizontally.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"
