"""
The transformation rule involves swapping two non-zero pixels within each row of the input grid, but only under a specific, yet-to-be-determined condition. If a row contains zero, one, or more than two non-zero pixels, they remain in their original positions. The condition for swapping when two pixels are present isn't simply based on their initial relative positions but must depend on other factors like color.
