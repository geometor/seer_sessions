observations:
  - task: 045e1a15
    example_set: training
    objects: Non-zero pixels within the grid.
    properties:
      - color: Integer value (1-9) representing a color.
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
      - row_count: Number of non-zero pixels in a row.
    actions:
      - swap: Exchange positions of two objects within the same row,
              conditioned on the color values AND relative column,
              where colors are only swapped within a row,
              when two objects exists in that row,
              and after sorting the objects in that row by column,
              the first object is greater than the second one.
    rules:
      - "If a row contains exactly two non-zero pixels, consider swapping their positions."
      - "Swap only occurs when, after ordering by column, the value of the first pixel is greater than the value of the second pixel."
      - "Rows with zero, one, or more than two non-zero pixels remain unchanged."
