            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 2D grids of varying sizes, populated with single-digit integers (0-9) representing different colors.  The most obvious element is the presence of rectangular shapes formed by non-zero pixels. The background is consistently color 0 (white). The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids and seem to contain only a single \"object\" from the input. It appears the transformation selects and extracts one specific colored object.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Shapes:** Scan the input grid and identify all distinct rectangular regions of non-zero pixels. Each region is considered a separate \"shape,\" characterized by its color, position, width, and height.\n2.  **Select Shape:** Choose *one* of the identified shapes based on the criteria defined in the selection rule. The selection rule is the key part that is changing, and needs to be inferred and generalized.\n    *   Example 1 selects the yellow (4) object\n    *   Example 2 selects the magenta (6) object\n    *   Example 3 selects the gray (5) object\n3.  **Extract Shape:** Create a new, smaller grid. Copy the selected shape from the input grid onto this new grid in the upper-left corner.\n4. **Remove Zeros**: Remove rows and columns composed of only 0's (white) from all sides (top, left, bottom, and right) of the output grid, ensuring that the shape occupies the new grid fully with no extra 0 values around it.\n\n**Selection Rule Hypothesis**:\nThe most difficult aspect to discern immediately is the shape *selection rule*. The selected object changes among each example and there isn't yet an obvious common feature to suggest why the object is selected (size, location, color). It could be based on any combination of features - color, position, dimensions, order of appearance, or a more complex hidden property. More information from more examples is needed to deduce a fully generalizable selection rule.\n\n**Next Step Suggestion**: I would need to see more examples before fully determining the selection method.\n"
