1. Identify Shapes: Scan the input grid and identify all distinct rectangular regions of non-zero pixels. Each region is considered a separate "shape," characterized by its color, position, width, and height.
2. Select Shape: Choose *one* of the identified shapes based on a specific criteria.
    - Example 1 selects the yellow (4) object

    - Example 3 selects the gray (5) object
3. Extract Shape: Create a new, smaller grid. Copy the selected shape from the input grid onto this new grid.

Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The current code identifies rectangular shapes of non-zero pixels and extracts one based on color. The selection logic is hardcoded for each example, which is not a general solution. The code fails for examples 2 and 3 because it's selecting based on an `example_index` which is not a reliable selection method. It happens to match the first example correctly, select color 4 (yellow) and the code removes enclosing rows/columns of 0's, thus it passes. The core issue is the shape selection logic, which needs to be generalized based on a property other than simply the training example index. We need to identify a consistent rule or pattern for selecting the correct shape across all examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Gather Metrics:** Analyze each example's input, expected output, and transformed output using code execution (if needed, though manual inspection seems sufficient for now). We'll look for patterns in the selected shapes (size, position, color relative to other shapes, etc.).
2.  **Identify Selection Rule:** Based on the metrics, formulate a hypothesis about the shape selection rule. It might involve properties like size, position, color, or a combination.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Refine the natural language program to reflect the new selection rule and other observed transformations.
4.  **Update Code:** Modify the `select_shape` function (in the next coding phase) to implement the generalized selection rule.

**Example Metrics and Observations:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Multiple shapes (yellow, blue, red).
    *   Expected/Transformed Output: The yellow shape (4 4 / 4 4).
    *   Observation: The yellow shape is selected.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Multiple shapes (red, magenta, green)
    *   Expected Output: The lower magenta object (6 6 6 6 / 0 6 6 0)
    *   Transformed output: The red shape (2 2 0 0 / 0 2 2 2)
    *   Observation: A magenta shape is selected, but the current code gets red. There are two magenta areas, and the lower one is correct. The expected ouput is not a simple bounding box extract, but the 0's are maintained relative to the shape in the input
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Multiple shapes (green, gray, blue)
    *   Expected Output: The gray shape (5 0 0 5 / 5 5 5 5)
    *   Transformed output: extracts the green object.
    *   Observation: A gray shape is selected. The internal zeros are kept.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    selected_shape_color: 4  # Yellow
    selection_rule: "bounding box"
    output_includes_internal_zeros: false
  - example_id: 2
    selected_shape_color: 6  # Magenta
    selection_rule: "lower magenta object, internal zeros preserved"
    output_includes_internal_zeros: true
  - example_id: 3
    selected_shape_color: 5  # Gray
    selection_rule: "gray object, internal zeros preserved"
    output_includes_internal_zeros: true
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Shapes:** Scan the input grid and identify all distinct, contiguous regions of non-zero pixels. Each region is a "shape", defined by its color, position, width, height, and constituent pixels.
2.  **Select Shape:**
      * If there's a yellow (color 4) shape: Select it (example 1)
      * If there is no yellow shape, but a magenta shape exists: Select the lower of the magenta shape(s) (Example 2)
      * If there is no yellow or magenta, select the gray (color 5) object (Example 3)
3. **Extract Shape**: Create a new grid containing *only* the selected shape, maintaining internal zeros within the shape.
4. **Preserve Internal Zeros (Conditional):** If the selected shape had internal zeros in the original input grid, those zero positions must be maintained in the output grid. Zeros surrounding the shape on all sides are removed.

Based on the three examples, the color selection logic is a priority: yellow, then magenta (and the *lower* one), then gray. Internal zeros, when present within the selected shape in the input, are maintained in the output.
