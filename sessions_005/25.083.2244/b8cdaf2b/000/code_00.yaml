facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - object: "Largest contiguous color block"
    properties:
      - "Defined by the highest single-digit value present in the grid (excluding 0)."
      - "Consists of one or more adjacent pixels of the same color."
    actions:
      - "Identified as the primary target for transformation."
  - object: "Top Border Pixels"
    properties:
      - The set of colors that build up the border of the "Largest contiguous color block"
    actions:
      - Copy values from the "Top Border Pixels" one row/column above the position, when possible. If the border extends to row 0, copy to the bottom if available, otherwise it stops.
  - relationship: "The rest of the grid (pixels not involved by the top border copy) remains unchanged."
