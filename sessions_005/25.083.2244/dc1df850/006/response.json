            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were on the right track, focusing on identifying non-white pixels and attempting to place 3x3 blue blocks around them. However, the results show inconsistencies, particularly in how edge cases are handled and how the expansion interacts with other colored pixels. The core issue is the blanket application of the 3x3 blue block replacement, overriding other potential targets and making the expansion non-local. The program needed to be more robust and able to handle cases in all situations.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the pixel differences in the failed examples (1 and 2) to understand precisely *why* the output is incorrect. This involves looking not just at the final output, but how each operation proceeds.\n2.  **Refine Edge Handling:** The current `can_place_3x3` function is necessary but not sufficient. We need to consider *all* situations not just for the center pixel.\n3.  **Prioritize Non-Overlapping Operations:** consider how to deal with the placement of multiple 3x3 blocks and how they must maintain the information of overlapping blocks.\n4. **Iterate and test with edge cases**: Add additional constraints and conditions to the logic and iterate by re-running the examples.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and fact finding (using code execution):**\nWe really don't need metrics for this, but we do need to examine the shape and values to form our new plan.\n\n"
