observations:
  - object: non_white_pixel
    description: Any pixel in the input grid with a value other than 0.
    properties:
      color: Varies (1-9, excluding 0).
      position: (row, column) index in the grid.
    actions:
      - name: expand_to_3x3
        condition: "If a 3x3 area centered on the pixel can be placed within the grid bounds, the pixel initiates expansion."
        transformation: >
          A 3x3 block of blue (1) pixels is created, centered on the original pixel's location.
          The original pixel's color is retained at the center of this 3x3 block.
        constraints:
          - "The 3x3 expansion does *not* occur if it would extend beyond the grid boundaries."
          - "Expansions do not overwrite other colors."

  - object: grid
    description: The 2D array representing the image.
    properties:
      dimensions: (rows, columns) - varies per example.
    actions: [] # The grid itself doesn't perform actions, but its elements do.
