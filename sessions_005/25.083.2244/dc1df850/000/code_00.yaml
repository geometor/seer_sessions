facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grids contain various colored pixels, with '0' (white) being the most common.
  - objects:
    - Single-color pixels are considered individual objects
    - There are no multi-pixel objects
  - properties:
      - color: Each pixel has a color, represented by a digit (0-9).
      - position: Each pixel has a row and column position in the grid.
  - actions:
      - Added: Some pixels, particularly blue ones (color 1), are added around existing pixels.
  - relationships:
      - proximity: The addition of blue pixels seems related to the proximity of non-white pixels.
      - clustering: Blue pixels are added in a clustering fashion.
  - constraints:
      - output_dimensions: the dimension of the output grid is the same as the dimension of the input grid
