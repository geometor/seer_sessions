Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were on the right track, focusing on identifying non-white pixels and attempting to place 3x3 blue blocks around them. However, the results show inconsistencies, particularly in how edge cases are handled and how the expansion interacts with other colored pixels. The core issue is the blanket application of the 3x3 blue block replacement, overriding other potential targets and making the expansion non-local. The program needed to be more robust and able to handle cases in all situations.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the pixel differences in the failed examples (1 and 2) to understand precisely *why* the output is incorrect. This involves looking not just at the final output, but how each operation proceeds.
2.  **Refine Edge Handling:** The current `can_place_3x3` function is necessary but not sufficient. We need to consider *all* situations not just for the center pixel.
3.  **Prioritize Non-Overlapping Operations:** consider how to deal with the placement of multiple 3x3 blocks and how they must maintain the information of overlapping blocks.
4. **Iterate and test with edge cases**: Add additional constraints and conditions to the logic and iterate by re-running the examples.

**Metrics Gathering and fact finding (using code execution):**
We really don't need metrics for this, but we do need to examine the shape and values to form our new plan.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
observations:
  - object: non_white_pixel
    description: Any pixel in the input grid with a value other than 0.
    properties:
      color: Varies (1-9, excluding 0).
      position: (row, column) index in the grid.
    actions:
      - name: expand_to_3x3
        condition: "If a 3x3 area centered on the pixel can be placed within the grid bounds, the pixel initiates expansion."
        transformation: >
          A 3x3 block of blue (1) pixels is created, centered on the original pixel's location.
          The original pixel's color is retained at the center of this 3x3 block.
        constraints:
          - "The 3x3 expansion does *not* occur if it would extend beyond the grid boundaries."
          - "Expansions do not overwrite other colors."

  - object: grid
    description: The 2D array representing the image.
    properties:
      dimensions: (rows, columns) - varies per example.
    actions: [] # The grid itself doesn't perform actions, but its elements do.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Scan the input grid to identify all "target pixels," which are any pixels with a non-white color (value not equal to 0).

2.  **Conditional 3x3 Expansion:** For *each* target pixel:
    *   **Boundary Check:** Determine if a 3x3 block, centered on the target pixel, can be placed entirely within the grid boundaries.
    *   **Expansion:** If the 3x3 block fits within the bounds, perform the following steps:
        1.  Create a 3x3 block of blue (value 1) pixels.
        2.  Place this blue block on the output grid, centered at the target pixel's original location.
        3.  Replace the center pixel of the newly placed 3 x 3 block (i.e. original target pixel location) with the original color of the target pixel.
    * **No Expansion:** If the 3x3 block would extend beyond the grid boundaries, *retain the original pixel value unchanged at that location*.

3. **Preserve other non-white pixels:** Ensure existing non-white values are kept and only replaced by blue within a 3x3 block.

Key Changes and Clarifications:

*   **Emphasis on Individuality:** The program now explicitly states that the expansion process is applied to each target pixel *individually*.
*   **Precise Boundary Handling:** It's clarified that the *entire* 3x3 block must fit, not just the center pixel.
*   **No Overlap:** Expansion must not overwrite existing non-zero pixels.
*  **Explicit "No Expansion" Case:** if no expansion is possible - the program now explicitly retains the original.
