The output grids appear to be a condensed or filtered version of the input grids.  The most prominent colors seem to be yellow (4), red (2), green (9), and blue (1), though all colors appear in the examples. The key recurring element across all examples is a vertical line of '2's in the input that seems to separate regions or trigger the transformation in some way. The shapes and sizes vary.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"

Iterate through this sub-grid column by column, from left to right. For each column do the following:\n    *   scan the input column and search for the most repeated value, maintaining also the value '9' if exists.\n    *   add the most repeated value to the output column. If value '9' exists then insert in the first available position, otherwise use the color '4' if no other color is found.\n\n3.  **Process right side:** Consider the sub-grid to the *right* of the red '2' column.\n     *   The '9' values are kept in order in the output grid, overwriting the last generated column if necessary. All the other values are discarded\n\n4.  **Form Output:** The processed columns form the output grid.\n"
