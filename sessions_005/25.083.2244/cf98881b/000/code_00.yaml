facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids are rectangular."
  - observation: "Each cell contains a single digit representing a color."
  - observation: "A vertical line of '2's (red) appears consistently in the input grids."
  - observation: "The output grid dimensions are smaller or equal to the input grid dimensions."
  - observation: "The output grid appears to be derived primarily from the left-most region up to the '2' column of the input."
  - observation: "Colors on the right of the '2' column have a very minimal relation on the output - the ninth color is kept in the same column, other colors are skipped."
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - object: red_line
    properties:
       - value: 2
       - description: vertical line of 2s in the input grid.
  - action: transformation
    description: "Condenses the input grid based on the position of the red line, retaining some colors and positions from the input."
  - relationship: "output_grid is derived from input_grid"
