Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grids seem to have multiple colored objects, delineated by '0' (white) spaces. The output grid appears to extract and condense specific colored pixels from the input, arranging them in a specific order. The output grid is always a 5x4 grid. Crucially, the output grid has many white zero elements. There are four non-zero elements in the output, one in each column from 1 to 4. Vertically, the position of these elements seem fixed.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x10
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - description: Contains multiple colored regions, separated by 0 (white)
  - type: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x5
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - description: Smaller grid containing a selection of colors from the input_grid.
  - type: color_blocks
    properties:
      - colors: various (1-9)
      - shape: contiguous blocks of the same color
      - location: input grid row, and range of cols
    behavior:
      - input grid blocks are selected and some transferred to output grid

relationships:
  - type: selection
    description: Specific colored pixels from the input grid are selected.
  - type: arrangement
    description: Selected pixels are arranged in a specific order and size within the output grid.
  - type: reduction
    description: The overall grid size is reduced, and many of the input grid blocks are removed.

actions:
  - select_columns: Four specific columns from the input_grid are selected.
  - extract_pixels: A single pixel from each selected column (from specific row) is extracted.
  - position: Each pixel is moved to the output grid at a specific row and column, overwriting anything already there.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Target Columns:** Examine the input grid and identify four distinct columns, always the 2nd, 5th, 7th, and 9th cols (indexed from 1). These columns are where the colored elements will be extracted.

2. **Locate Colored Pixels in Rows:** Within each of the four identified columns (2, 5, 7, and 9), identify a region of non-zero pixels. All these non-zero columns have a height of 3. The output uses only the colored block that is found in row 2, 3 and 4. If a targeted column does not contain a colored pixel region in rows 2, 3 or 4, skip that column.

3. **Extract Middle Pixel:** For each of the four target columns, take the colored pixel in the middle row (row 3) in the input grid.

4. **Construct Output Grid:** Create a 4x5 output grid filled with 0s (white).

5. **Place Pixels:** Place the four extracted colored pixels into the output grid. The pixel extracted from the 2nd column of the input grid will always be placed on the 2nd column of the output grid (at row 2). Similarly, the pixel extracted from the 5th column of the input grid will be put in the 3rd column (row 2), and the one from 7th column in 4th col (row 2) and the one in 9th column in 5th column (row 2).

In summary: Extract the middle pixel from any colored region that occurs in the 2nd, 5th, 7th, and 9th column of the input grid (at rows 2,3,4), and place these in the output grid in the second row, columns 2 to 5, respectively.
