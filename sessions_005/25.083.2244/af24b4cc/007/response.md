"""
Extracts the color value of the first pixel from specific colored regions within the input grid and places them in a smaller output grid. Colored regions are identified in the 2nd, 5th, 7th, and 9th columns of the input grid. Regions starting in rows 2-4 are considered "upper", and regions starting in rows 6-8 are considered "lower". The first pixel's color of each upper region is placed in the 2nd row of the output, and the first pixel's color of each lower region is placed in the 3rd row of the output, with column mapping maintained.
