"""
Extracts specific colored pixels from the input grid and places them in a smaller output grid. Pixels are taken from specific rows within the 2nd, 5th, 7th, and 9th columns of the input, based on whether the colored block intersects the upper region (rows 2-4) or lower region (rows 6-8). These pixels are placed in the 2nd row and columns 2-5 of the output if from the upper region, or 3rd row and columns 2-5 of the output if from the lower region.
