The input and output grids have different dimensions and contain different arrangements of colors. There's a clear sense of spatial transformation and object manipulation. The key seems to be identifying a specific pattern or object in the input and reconstructing it with different colors in the output, potentially with some form of mirroring or symmetry.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
