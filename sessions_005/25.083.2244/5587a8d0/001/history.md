Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into another grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have different dimensions and contain different arrangements of colors. There's a clear sense of spatial transformation and object manipulation. The key seems to be identifying a specific pattern or object in the input and reconstructing it with different colors in the output, potentially with some form of mirroring or symmetry.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are rectangular and contain various colors.
  - observation: Output grids are rectangular and contain a subset of colors from the input, or have colors that are related or derived in some way from colors found in the input grid.
  - observation: Output grid dimensions are smaller than input grid dimensions.
  - object: input_grid, type: grid, description: The original grid of pixels.
  - object: output_grid, type: grid, description: The transformed grid of pixels.
  - object: border, type: color, description: A color that consistently frames an inner part of the image in the input grid. In train_1, this color is 7, train_2 the border color is 7, and in train_3 the border color is 7.
  - object: core, type: subgrid, description: The central region of the input grid, defined by the border.
  - action: extract_core, description: Isolates the core subgrid from the input grid.
  - action: transform_colors, description: Maps colors from the input core to new colors in the output core.
  - relationship: border_defines_core, description: The border color defines the boundary of the core subgrid.
  - relationship: core_transforms_to_output, description: The core subgrid, after color transformation, becomes the output grid.
  - transformation: train_1, input_border: 7, output_border: 4, core_color_change: 4 -> 6.
  - transformation: train_2, input_border: 7, output_border: 1, core_color_change: 8 -> 8, 5 -> 5, 1-> 8.
  - transformation: train_3, input_border: 7, output_border: 8, core_color_change: 8->0, 3 ->3, 9 -> 3, 7->0.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Border:** Find the outermost layer of color that completely surrounds the grid in the input.
2.  **Extract the Core:** Remove the identified border, isolating the internal rectangular "core" of the input grid.
3.  **Construct the Output Border**: Construct a new "output core" grid that is 2 rows and 2 columns longer and wider than the extracted core, filled with a new border color.
4.  **Map Input Core Colors:** Transform the colors of the extracted core to a new set of colors:
    *   In example 1: The input border color 7 becomes 4, and other inner colors 4 become 6.
    *   In example 2: The input border color 7 becomes 1, and the other inner colors transform with the rule 8 -> 8, 5 -> 5, 1-> 8.
    *   In example 3: The input border color 7 becomes 8, and the other inner colors 8->0, 3 ->3, 9 -> 3, 7->0.
5. **Place Core in Output**: The transformed-color extracted core is placed in the center of the output grid constructed from the new border color.

This program describes how to isolate a central region, transform its colors according to a specific rule dependent on the example, and use that transformed region, surrounded by a new border, as the output.
