facts:
  - description: "The output grid is always 3x3."
    type: constraint
    value: [3, 3]

  - description: "Pixels with value 0 or 5 in the input grid are excluded."
    type: exclusion
    values: [0, 5]

  - description: "Example 1 extracts color 4 pixels and places them seemingly based on their relative x and y coordinates within a subgrid of the input. Zeros fill empty spaces in the output."
    type: observation
    example: 1

  - description: "Example 2 extracts color 1 pixels, maintaining their relative positions, adding a 0 when no pixel is present."
    type: observation
    example: 2

  - description: "Example 3 extracts color 2 pixels. Output grid is filled with input pixels relative position and zeros."
    type: observation
    example: 3

  - description: "The positioning of non-zero and non-5 pixels in the output grid appears related to the spatial layout in input grid, with 0 used as padding"
    type: hypothesis
