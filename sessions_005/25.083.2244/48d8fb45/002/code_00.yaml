  description: Non-zero pixels are re-arranged, removing empty rows and columns and compacting the remaining elements.
  rule: "The output grid is formed by taking only the rows and columns with at least one non-zero element from the input grid, re-arranging and moving all non-zero pixels to fill a new rectangular grid, starting at the top-left corner (0,0). Pixels of color 5 are removed."
