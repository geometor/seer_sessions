The sub-grid appears to be defined by the non-zero pixels, forming a sort of \"bounding box\" around a cluster, or clusters, of connected non-zero pixels. The background is always white (0). The extracted subgrids seem to maintain the spatial arrangement of the non-zero pixels relative to one another. Specifically the smallest sub-grid possible seems to be extracted, and that any values outside that sub-grid become irrelevant, with zeros acting as whitespace/padding.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

This defines the rectangular bounding box.\n3. **Extract Sub-grid:** Create a new, smaller grid. The width of this sub-grid the difference between max_x and min_x, plus 1. The height is max_y - min_y + 1.\n4.  **Copy Pixels:** Copy the non-zero pixels from the input grid to the new sub-grid. Preserve the non-zero pixels positions *relative* to the top-left corner defined by `min_x`, `min_y`. Fill the other cells of the new smaller grid with zeros.\n\nIn essence, this program describes finding the smallest rectangle within the input grid that contains all the non-zero colored pixels and then extracting that rectangle as the output.\n"
