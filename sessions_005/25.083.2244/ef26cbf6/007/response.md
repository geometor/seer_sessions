1.  **Find the Mirroring Axis:** Locate the horizontal line composed entirely of yellow (4) pixels. This is the axis of symmetry.

2.  **Mirror and Transform Colors:** For each pixel *above* the yellow line:
    *   Find its corresponding "mirrored" pixel below the yellow line. The mirrored pixel is located at the same horizontal distance from the yellow line as the original pixel, but on the opposite side.
    *   The values are then changed based on a mapping.
    *   Mapping Table:
        *   If above is 0 then below is 0.
        *   If above is 1 and distance is 1 then below is 3.
        *   If above is 1 and distance is 2 then below is 2.
        *   If above is 1 and distance is 3 then below is 6.
        *   If above is 2 then below is 2.
        *   If above is 3 then below is 3.
        *   If above is 6 then below is 6.
        *   If above is 7 then below is 8.

3.  **Replace Colors Above:**
    *  If above is 1 change to 7.

4.  **Leave other values unchanged.** The mirroring and color transformations are applied to all columns.
