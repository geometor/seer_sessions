example1:
  dimensions: [11, 7]
  yellow_line_row: 3
  objects:
    - type: grid
      properties:
        - colors: [0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8]
    - type: line
      properties:
        color: 4
        orientation: horizontal
        row_index: 3
  transformations:
    - type: mirror
      axis: yellow_line_row
      description: "Colors above the yellow line are mirrored below, with color changes."
    - type: color_change
      conditions: "Based on the color and relative position of pixels above the yellow line."

          Above(1) -> Below(3)  [If distance = 1]
          Above(1) -> Below(2)  [If distance = 2]
          Above(1) -> Below(6)  [If distance = 3]
          Above(x) -> Below(x') [Generalized mapping needed based on observations]
