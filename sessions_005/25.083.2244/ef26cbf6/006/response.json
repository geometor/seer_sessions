            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, and it correctly identified the yellow line as a mirroring axis and the color change of blue pixels. However, it failed in a few key areas:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Mirroring Logic:** The code attempts a column-wise, localized mirroring *only* for blue pixels, triggered by the presence of blue *above* the yellow line. It applies a fixed color change based on the distance *below* the line. The provided examples demonstrates that the mirroring might not be strictly column-wise and that color changes below depend on colors *and* relative position above.\n2. **Incomplete Color Changes**: Example 2 shows changes of colours which are not blue above the yellow line. The logic only handles the transformation of blue (1) pixels, but other color transformations are apparent.\n3. **Ignores original colors below:** It does not correctly change other colors based on mirroring from colors above.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Mirroring:** We need to accurately determine what is mirrored. It seems to be more than a simple column-wise operation. Need to verify the exact nature of spatial transformation.\n2.  **Generalized Color Transformations:** Instead of hardcoding color changes for just blue, we must generalize. The transformation seems to act on more colours.\n3. **Relative Positioning Matters**: Both distance and color above the yellow line is crucial.\n\n**Gathering Metrics and Facts:**\n\nLet's use a `tool_code` block to derive useful metrics. We need to know:\n\n*   Dimensions of each grid.\n*   Row index of the yellow line.\n*   Colors above and below the yellow line and their positions.\n* The number of pixels where the transformed ouput did not match the expected.\n\n"
