The transformation takes a 3x3 input grid filled with the color 5 (gray) and places it into a 9x9 output grid filled with 0 (white). The placement varies: in the first three examples, the input grid is placed at the top-left corner and replicated three times horizontally and vertically. In the fourth example, the input grid is placed in the center of the output grid and replicated three times horizontally and vertically.
