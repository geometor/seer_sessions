            count: 54
          - color: 1 # blue
            shape: horizontal line replicated in output, 3x input length
            count: 9
          - color: 2  # red
            shape: contiguous block, appears 3x
          - color: 6
            shape: contiguous, appears 3x
      transformation:
        - The input grid is placed in the top-left corner of the output grid.
        - The remaining area of the output grid is filled with 0 (white).
