facts:
  - observation: Input grids are of different sizes.
  - observation: Output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids.
  - observation: Color '0' (white) is often, but not always, the background.
  - observation: Color '5' (gray) appears in the output, replacing some '0's.
  - observation: Non-zero colored regions maintain their shape but may have their color changed.
  - observation: Non-zero colors in the input may change to either the original color or to 5
  - hypothesis:  The transformation involves identifying the locations in the input grid containing '0' (white) and replacing some or all of them with '5' (grey), other colors may be unchanged or converted to 5.
