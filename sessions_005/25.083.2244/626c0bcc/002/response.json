This is a simple fix \u2013 I need to ensure that any necessary libraries are included when running the code. Beyond that, the logic seems reasonable, targeting azure (8) colored pixels and attempting to identify \"corners\" of connected regions to change their colors. The strategy to resolve errors will focus on fixing the code, and then re-evaluating based on all training examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Fix the Import Error:** Add a check to confirm that `scipy` is available.\n2.  **Re-run and Evaluate:** Execute the corrected code against all training examples.\n3.  **Analyze Results:** Compare the output of the corrected code with the expected outputs in the training examples.\n4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on discrepancies, adjust the natural language description of the transformation to accurately reflect *all* training examples.\n5. **Document Facts:** Create the requested YAML documentation\n6. **Provide Deliverables**: all together\n\n**Gather Metrics (using code execution after fixing import):**\n\nI'll hold off on using a `tool_code` block until I've addressed the import issue, as the current code will definitely fail.\n\n**Fact Documentation (YAML):**\n\n"
