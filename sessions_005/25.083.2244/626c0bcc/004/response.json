            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code failed because it relies on the `scipy` library, which is not available in the standard environment. Although this prevents a complete comparison of input to output for this first trial, the error itself presents new information that we need to adjust to.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Address the `scipy` Dependency:** Since `scipy` is unavailable, I need to refactor the code to achieve the same functionality using only the standard libraries, specifically `numpy`.  The core functionality needed from `scipy` is:\n    *   `label`:  This function finds connected components in a binary array. We can implement a similar function using a breadth-first or depth-first search algorithm with `numpy`.\n    *   `find_objects`: Not used.\n\n2.  **Re-evaluate Examples:** Once the code is runnable without `scipy`, I'll re-run the tests on all provided training examples. The results of these tests will provide crucial feedback.\n\n3. **Metrics Gathering:** I will use `numpy` to derive metrics.\n\n4.  **YAML & Natural Language Program Update:** After gathering the metrics and successfully running the code, I'll update the YAML facts and the natural language program to accurately reflect the transformation rule, ensuring it covers all observed cases.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (Conceptual - will be implemented in code):**\nAfter getting a basic, working, and tested algorithm, I plan to collect these metrics. Because of the current code error, I cannot yet collect them.\n\n*   **Input Grid Dimensions:** Height and width of each input grid.\n*   **Output Grid Dimensions:** Height and width of each output grid.\n*   **Azure Pixel Count (Input):** Number of azure pixels in each input grid.\n*   **Cluster Count (Input):** Number of distinct azure clusters in each input grid.\n*   **Color Changes:**  A count of how many pixels of each color (blue, yellow, green, red) replace azure pixels in each example.\n*   **Unchanged Pixels:** Count the non-azure pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts (Preliminary - will be updated):**\n\n"

Pixels are connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically, but *not* diagonally.\n3.  **Extrema Determination:** Within each identified azure cluster, locate four \"extrema\" pixels:\n    *   **Top-Left:** The azure pixel with the smallest row and smallest column index.\n    *   **Top-Right:** The azure pixel with the smallest row and largest column index.\n    *   **Bottom-Left:** The azure pixel with the largest row and smallest column index.\n    *   **Bottom-Right:** The azure pixel with the largest row and largest column index.\n4.  **Color Transformation:**  Change the color of the identified extrema pixels as follows:\n    *   Top-Left pixel becomes blue (1).\n    *   Top-Right pixel becomes yellow (4).\n    *   Bottom-Left pixel becomes green (3).\n    *   Bottom-Right pixel becomes red (2).\n5. **Preservation of other colors.** All non-azure pixels must retain their original color.\n6.  **Output:** The modified 2D grid with the color transformations applied.\n\nThe key next step is to create a `scipy`-free version of the `transform` function.\n"
