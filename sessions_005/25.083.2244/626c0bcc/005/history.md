Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Iterate through Input:** Examine each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Find pixels that are colored azure (value 8).
3.  **Cluster Detection:** Group the azure pixels into connected components (clusters), where pixels are considered connected if they are adjacent (up, down, left, or right â€“ not diagonally).
4. **Find Extrema:** For each cluster found, identify the following special pixels:
      - **Top-Left:** The pixel with the smallest row and smallest column value.
      - **Top-Right:** The pixel with the smallest row and largest column value.
      - **Bottom-Left:** The pixel with the largest row and smallest column value.
      - **Bottom-Right:** The pixel with the largest row and largest column value.

5.  **Color Transformation:** Change colors:
    *   Top-Left pixel to blue (1).
    *   Top-Right pixel to yellow (4).
    *   Bottom-Left pixel to green (3).
    *   Bottom-Right pixel to red (2).

6.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All pixels that are *not* azure (8) in the original input grid should remain the same color in the output grid.
7.  **Output:** Construct the output grid by applying the above rules to every pixel in the input grid.

Train Set Error: error:
No module named 'scipy'
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code failed because it relies on the `scipy` library, which is not available in the standard environment. Although this prevents a complete comparison of input to output for this first trial, the error itself presents new information that we need to adjust to.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Address the `scipy` Dependency:** Since `scipy` is unavailable, I need to refactor the code to achieve the same functionality using only the standard libraries, specifically `numpy`.  The core functionality needed from `scipy` is:
    *   `label`:  This function finds connected components in a binary array. We can implement a similar function using a breadth-first or depth-first search algorithm with `numpy`.
    *   `find_objects`: Not used.

2.  **Re-evaluate Examples:** Once the code is runnable without `scipy`, I'll re-run the tests on all provided training examples. The results of these tests will provide crucial feedback.

3. **Metrics Gathering:** I will use `numpy` to derive metrics.

4.  **YAML & Natural Language Program Update:** After gathering the metrics and successfully running the code, I'll update the YAML facts and the natural language program to accurately reflect the transformation rule, ensuring it covers all observed cases.

**Metrics Gathering (Conceptual - will be implemented in code):**
After getting a basic, working, and tested algorithm, I plan to collect these metrics. Because of the current code error, I cannot yet collect them.

*   **Input Grid Dimensions:** Height and width of each input grid.
*   **Output Grid Dimensions:** Height and width of each output grid.
*   **Azure Pixel Count (Input):** Number of azure pixels in each input grid.
*   **Cluster Count (Input):** Number of distinct azure clusters in each input grid.
*   **Color Changes:**  A count of how many pixels of each color (blue, yellow, green, red) replace azure pixels in each example.
*   **Unchanged Pixels:** Count the non-azure pixels.

**YAML Facts (Preliminary - will be updated):**

  - name: grid
    type: 2D array

    description: Change the color of the extrema pixels based on their relative position.
  - name: preserve_other_colors
    input: grid

```


**Natural Language Program (Preliminary - will be updated):**

1.  **Input:** A 2D grid of integer values (0-9) representing colors.
2.  **Azure Cluster Identification:** Identify connected regions (clusters) of azure (8) colored pixels.  Pixels are connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically, but *not* diagonally.
3.  **Extrema Determination:** Within each identified azure cluster, locate four "extrema" pixels:
    *   **Top-Left:** The azure pixel with the smallest row and smallest column index.
    *   **Top-Right:** The azure pixel with the smallest row and largest column index.
    *   **Bottom-Left:** The azure pixel with the largest row and smallest column index.
    *   **Bottom-Right:** The azure pixel with the largest row and largest column index.
4.  **Color Transformation:**  Change the color of the identified extrema pixels as follows:
    *   Top-Left pixel becomes blue (1).
    *   Top-Right pixel becomes yellow (4).
    *   Bottom-Left pixel becomes green (3).
    *   Bottom-Right pixel becomes red (2).
5. **Preservation of other colors.** All non-azure pixels must retain their original color.
6.  **Output:** The modified 2D grid with the color transformations applied.

The key next step is to create a `scipy`-free version of the `transform` function.
