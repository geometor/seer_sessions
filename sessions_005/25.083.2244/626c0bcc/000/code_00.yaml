facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - observation: The background color (0, white) remains unchanged.
  - observation: Only azure (8) pixels in the input are subject to color change.
  - observation: The new color of an azure pixel depends on its original position and its neighbors.
  - observation: the output color of the changed input pixels are one of red (2), blue (1), green (3) and yellow (4)

  - relationship: Connected azure pixels may change to different colors
  - hypothesis: "clusters" and relative postions may determine transformation
