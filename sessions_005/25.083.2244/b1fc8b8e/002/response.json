            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to address the errors:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe errors indicate a consistent issue: \"index 4 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 4\". This strongly suggests that the cropping logic, intended to extract a 4x4 central section, is either miscalculated or is being applied incorrectly in the context of the cross-pattern placement. The initial assumption about the 4x4 cropping was only valid for the first training example and does not hold true for the others.\u00a0The 5x5 output grid and cross pattern are likely correct in principle, but the interaction between the cropping and the pattern application needs to be revised. Since *all* examples fail with the same error, it is not a edge case, but a fundamental flaw in applying the input grid content to the output.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Inspect Input Grids:** Determine the dimensions of *all* input grids. The original program assumed 6x6, which is incorrect. We need to know the actual sizes to correctly identify any central or relevant regions, and perhaps cropping isn't even the core concept.\n2.  **Re-evaluate Cropping:** Instead of assuming a fixed 4x4 crop, we must dynamically determine how (or if) to use the input grid data based on its dimensions relative to the 5x5 output grid. It may not be a simple \"crop\".\n3.  **Understand Output Pattern:** Confirm the intended cross-pattern. The code currently implements a specific cross. We must visually verify this pattern holds across all output examples.\n4. **Consider the intersection of Input and Pattern:** Instead of cropping and *then* applying, it is necessary to consider the input and pattern placement simultaneously.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using code execution):**\n\nI will now use a `tool_code` block to gather information about all input grid shapes. This will give us concrete data for the next step.\n\n"
