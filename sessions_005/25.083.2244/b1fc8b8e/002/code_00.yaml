  - object: input_grids
    description: 2D arrays of varying sizes, containing integer values representing colors.
    properties:
      dimensions:
        example_1: [6, 6]
        example_2: [6, 6]
        example_3: [5, 5]
        example_4: [6, 6]
        example_5: [5, 5]
      values: Integers from 0 to 9, representing colors.
      content:  The inner rows/cols have a solid color, different in each input
  - object: output_grids
    description: 2D arrays of size 5x5, containing integer values representing colors.
    properties:
      dimensions: [5, 5]
      values: Integers from 0 to 9, representing colors.
      pattern:  A cross-like pattern where the vertical and horizontal bars of the cross take on the solid inner color of the input.
  - action: transformation
    description:  Maps the inner, solid color region of the input grid to the cells that define the cross in the output grid.
    details: The output grid size is fixed.  The input grid solid inner color is placed on the cross pattern, all other cells are 0.
