The primary colors observed are azure (8) and white (0). The grids are all 6x6 in the input, and 5x5 in the output. A noticeable pattern is the arrangement of azure and white pixels, and how that arrangement changes from input to output. The input grid has more solid lines, the output has a cross like pattern.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
