Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improvement.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were overly simplistic. They focused solely on finding a "dominant inner color" and creating a fixed-size (5x5) cross-shaped output. The results show this approach is incorrect for multiple reasons:

1.  **Incorrect Output Size:** The expected outputs are not 5x5, but rather appear to maintain the outermost border of the original.
2.  **Incorrect Pattern:** The output pattern is not a simple cross, but a transformation of the original shape.
3.  **Incorrect color choice** - the colors are not being mapped properly

The core issue is that the initial program assumed a fixed output size and a very specific, simple pattern, which does not hold true across all examples. My strategy will involve:
* finding code that I can resuse from previous problems
* focusing on the input and output sizes and their relation.
* identifying the transformation of the original shape.

**Gather Metrics & Analysis:**

To understand the transformations better, I'll use `tool_code` to collect information about each input/output pair. Specifically, I'll analyze:

*   Input and Output Dimensions.
*   Unique colors in input and corresponding colors in output

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Determine Output Size:** The output grid is always 5x5. The input is 6x6

2.  **Extract Border:** Create a 5x5 output by taking the original 6x6 shape, and shrinking it - but only keep the outer border of the shape, and remove any pixels that would create a diagonal connection.

3.  **Fill Center:** Set the entire 3x3 center of the grid to color `0`.

4. **Color Preservation:** Maintain the original colors (0 and 8) from the input.
