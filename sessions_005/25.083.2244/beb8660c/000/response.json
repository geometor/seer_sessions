Each line can be a different color, and lines of the same color aren't necessarily adjacent.\n*   **Grid Structure:**  The input and output grids seem to maintain the same overall dimensions in train\\_1 and train\\_3, but train\\_2 input has 10 rows, while output has 11 rows. It's likely that the relative height and width change between input and output, so the dimensions aren't fixed.\n*   **Transformations:** The core transformation appears to be a rearrangement of the horizontal lines. Specifically, it looks like the lines are being vertically reordered. It seems that blank rows of 0 are added.\n* **Color Invariance**: It does appear that color is preserved, but changes positions.\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n"
