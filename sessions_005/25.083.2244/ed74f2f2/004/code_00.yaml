objects:
  - name: InputGrid
    type: 2DArray
    description: A grid of pixels representing colors.
    properties:
      - rows: 5-6 # Varies, but we only care about the central 3
      - columns: 9
      - cell_values: [0-9] # Representing colors

  - name: OutputGrid
    type: 2DArray
    description: A 3x3 grid representing the transformed output.
    properties:
      - rows: 3
      - columns: 3
      - cell_values: [0-9]

  - name: Subgrid
    type: 2DArray
    description:  3x3 sections extracted from the central rows of the InputGrid.
    properties:
      - rows: 3
      - columns: 3
      - cell_values: [0-9]

actions:
  - name: ExtractSubgrids
    input: InputGrid
    output: [Subgrid, Subgrid, Subgrid] # Three subgrids
    description: Divides the central three rows of the input grid into three 3x3 subgrids.

  - name: AnalyzeSubgrid
    input: Subgrid
    output: SubgridAnalysis # A structure containing information like gray pixel count, position, etc.
    description: Analyzes a subgrid to determine its properties. This currently focuses only on the gray count but should be expanded.
  - name: MapConfigToColor
    input: SubgridConfig
    output: column
    description: uses the configuration (flattened representation) of the subgrid to determine the output column

  - name: Transform
    input: [SubgridAnalysis, SubgridAnalysis, SubgridAnalysis]
    output: OutputGrid
    description: Combines the analyses of the three subgrids to produce the final output grid. The current logic is incorrect.
