facts:
  - input_grid_size: 9x5
  - output_grid_size: 3x3
  - input_background_color: 0 (white)
  - input_foreground_color: 5 (gray)
  - output_colors_present: [0, 1, 2, 3]
  - observation: "Output grid appears to be a 3x3 representation derived from the central gray patterns in the input."
  - object_identification:
    - type: "clusters of gray pixels"
      properties:
        - color: 5 (gray)
        - shape: "irregular"
      actions:
        - "appear in central rows/columns of input"
  - relationship: "The count of gray '5' pixels in each 3x3 section of the central part of the input determines output, a '1' represents the top-left and a '3' represent the bottom left, and '2' the middle areas."
