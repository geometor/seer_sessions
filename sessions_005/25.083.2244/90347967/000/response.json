However, in these examples, single pixels of different colors also seem to act as independent objects.\n*    **Spatial Arrangement**: in some cases the input grid pixels appear in reverse order in the output grid\n*   **Mirroring**: The output is the reverse of the input, and can be generated by rotating the input 180 degrees and shifting.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
