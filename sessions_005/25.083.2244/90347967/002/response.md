Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of reversing and right-shifting non-zero elements was partially successful. Example 1 worked perfectly, but Examples 2 and 3 failed. The primary issue seems to be with how the reversal and shifting are implemented. It appears the `np.flip` function flips the entire array, which is not always the intended outcome. It doesn't accurately model the expected shift. A row-by-row shift to the right is indeed needed, but the global flip isn't always correct. We may want to consider maintaining the original shapes.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Examples in Detail:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example to pinpoint the exact discrepancies. I will create a tool to identify the row and columns differences in the arrays.
2.  **Refine the Reversal/Shift Logic:** Instead of a global flip, consider reversing the order of elements *within* each row, followed by the right-shift.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the program to accurately reflect the refined logic, ensuring it covers all observed cases.

**Gather Metrics and Analyze Examples:**


``` python
import numpy as np

def compare_grids(expected, transformed):
    expected_grid = np.array(expected)
    transformed_grid = np.array(transformed)

    if expected_grid.shape != transformed_grid.shape:
        print("Shapes are different.")
        return

    diff = expected_grid != transformed_grid
    diff_indices = np.where(diff)
    diff_rows = diff_indices[0]
    diff_cols = diff_indices[1]

    print("Mismatched Pixels:")
    for row, col in zip(diff_rows, diff_cols):
        print(f"  Row: {row}, Col: {col}, Expected: {expected_grid[row, col]}, Transformed: {transformed_grid[row, col]}")

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task: reverse_and_shift_rows
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - shape: variable rows and columns

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - shape: same as input_grid

actions:
  - name: reverse_within_row
    description: Reverse the order of elements within each row, considering only non-zero elements.
    input: row (1D array)
    output: reversed_row (1D array)

  - name: shift_right
    description: Shift non-zero elements to the rightmost positions within each row.
    input: row (1D array)
    output: shifted_row (1D array)

  - name: combine
    description: create the output by shifting then reversing elements within each row
    input: input grid
    output: output grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros (white).
2.  **Row-wise Processing:** For each row in the input grid:
    a. **Identify Non-Zero Elements**: Extract the non-zero elements, preserving their original order.
    b. **Reverse Sub-row**: Reverse only the order of the non-zero elements extracted from the current row.
    c. **Right-Shift:** Create a new row for the output grid. Place the reversed non-zero elements to the rightmost positions of this new row. Fill the remaining positions (if any) with zeros.
    d. **Assign:** Copy this newly constructed row to the corresponding row in the output grid.
3. **Output:** The `output_grid` now contains the transformed data. Return this grid.

Essentially, the transformation reverses *only the non-zero elements* of each row and then right-aligns them. The previous implementation incorrectly flipped the entire array. The core concept is right, but the execution was flawed.
