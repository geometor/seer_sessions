            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of reversing and right-shifting non-zero elements was partially successful. Example 1 worked perfectly, but Examples 2 and 3 failed. The primary issue seems to be with how the reversal and shifting are implemented. It appears the `np.flip` function flips the entire array, which is not always the intended outcome. It doesn't accurately model the expected shift. A row-by-row shift to the right is indeed needed, but the global flip isn't always correct. We may want to consider maintaining the original shapes.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Examples in Detail:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example to pinpoint the exact discrepancies. I will create a tool to identify the row and columns differences in the arrays.\n2.  **Refine the Reversal/Shift Logic:** Instead of a global flip, consider reversing the order of elements *within* each row, followed by the right-shift.\n3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the program to accurately reflect the refined logic, ensuring it covers all observed cases.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Analyze Examples:**\n\n"
