  description: |
    Non-zero pixels are treated as objects. These objects are reordered
    vertically, with their output order being the reverse of their input
    vertical order.  Objects maintain their original column if possible. All objects
    are shifted upwards to occupy the highest possible rows.
  steps:
    - identify_non_zero_pixels
    - determine_vertical_order
    - reverse_vertical_order
    - construct_output_grid
