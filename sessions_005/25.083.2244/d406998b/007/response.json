Focus on pixels that are gray (color value 5).\n\n2.  **Check for Adjacent Gray Neighbors:** For each gray pixel, examine its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).\n\n3.  **Determine Line Formation:** A gray pixel is considered part of a line if at least *two* other gray pixels are adjacent to it, forming a continuous line segment. This line can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. It is *not* required the gray pixel is the *center* of a line of three.\n\n4.  **Change Color to Green:** If a gray pixel meets the line formation criteria (has at least two adjacent gray neighbors in a line), change its color to green (color value 3).\n\n5.  **Output:** The output grid is the result of these transformations, with all other pixels unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the observed rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    output_grid = input_grid.copy()\n\n    def count_adjacent_gray(r, c):\n        \"\"\"Counts adjacent gray pixels (including diagonals).\"\"\"\n        count = 0\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                    continue\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and input_grid[nr, nc] == 5:\n                    count += 1\n        return count\n\n    def check_line_neighbors(r,c):\n      \"\"\"check if at least two neighbors are gray, forming a line\"\"\"\n      count = 0\n      for dr in [-1,0,1]:\n        for dc in [-1,0,1]:\n          if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n            continue\n\n          nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n          if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and input_grid[nr,nc] == 5:\n            # check if there's another pixel in the same line direction\n            nr2, nc2 = nr + dr, nc + dc\n            if 0 <= nr2 < rows and 0 <= nc2 < cols and input_grid[nr2, nc2] == 5:\n                return True\n\n            # check opp direction\n            nr2, nc2 = r-dr, c-dc\n            if 0 <= nr2 < rows and 0 <= nc2 < cols and input_grid[nr2,nc2] == 5:\n                return True\n\n\n      return False\n    # Iterate through each cell of the input grid.\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Check if the current cell is gray (5).\n            if input_grid[r, c] == 5:\n                # Check for adjacent gray neighbors and line formation\n                if check_line_neighbors(r,c):\n                  output_grid[r,c] = 3\n\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
