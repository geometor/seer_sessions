objects:
  - grid: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - elements: integers (0-9)
      - color_dominance: [0, 5]

  - grid: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: same as input_grid
      - elements: integers (0-9)
      - color_dominance: [0, 3, 5]
      - color_change_rule: "gray (5) may change to green (3)"

  - pixel:
      properties:
        - color: integer (0-9)
        - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: color_change
    description: Changes a pixel's color from gray (5) to green (3)
    conditions:
      - "check location based rule for gray (5) pixels"
relationships:
    - input_output_grids: "one-to-one correspondence in dimensions; pixel transformations occur"
    - pixel_transformation : "some 5s change to 3, location is significant"
