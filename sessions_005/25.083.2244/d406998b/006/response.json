While this captures part of the pattern, it's not entirely accurate. The provided feedback shows discrepancies in all examples, indicating the rule needs adjustment. The core issue seems to be that the code only changes gray pixels to green if they are *in between* two other gray pixels, and does not handle the edge cases.\n\nThe new strategy should include examining how the surrounding grey pixels, and ensure the code handles grey pixels at the edge of patterns.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (per example):**\n\nTo better understand the patterns, let's represent the input and output grids as numpy arrays and use this to analyze the differences more precisely.\n\n"
