example1:
  input:
    size: 5x5
    border_color: 2
    inner_color: 3
    center_color: 5
  output:
    size: 10x10
    colors: [2, 3, 5]
    pattern: |
        The input grid is replicated in the top-left corner of the output grid.
        Columns of the border, inner, and center colors are added to create building blocks.
        The overall layout appears to combine these blocks, using mirroring and symmetry.

example2:
  input:
    size: 5x5
    border_color: 9
    inner_color: 8
    center_color: 2
  output:
    size: 10x10
    colors: [9, 8, 2]
    pattern: |
        Similar to example1, the input grid is replicated in the top-left.
        Columns of the border, inner, and center colors are added to create building blocks.
        The layout uses these in a symmetric fashion.
