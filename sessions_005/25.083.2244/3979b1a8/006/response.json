            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and devise a strategy to improve the transformation rule.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on observations from the first training example and correctly identified the border, inner, and center colors. The strategy of constructing \"planes\" (sub-grids) and arranging them is a reasonable approach. However, the code fails to accurately reproduce the bottom half of the output grid in both examples. The \"Pixels Off,\" \"Color Palette Correct,\" and \"Color Count Correct\" metrics all indicate significant discrepancies, particularly in the bottom half. The core issue is the incorrect reconstruction logic for rows 5-9 of the output grid.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze both examples, focusing on the relationship between the input and output grids, especially how the bottom half of the output is derived.\n2.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for consistent patterns in how colors and shapes from the input grid are replicated or transformed in the output grid. Pay very close attention to the arrangement of the center, border and inner colors.\n3. **Refine Bottom-Half Logic**: The primary focus will be modifying the code that constructs `output_grid[5:10, :]` to accurately reflect the observed pattern. The logic for the top half is correct.\n4. **Verify and Validate:** Use the provided results to continuously check assumptions and adjust logic accordingly. It's useful to see the partially correct construction of the top half.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nLet's use the `get_colors` function to ensure color identification is correct for both examples.\n\n"
