Okay, here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to address the errors in the generated code.

**General Assessment**

The initial code was based on a limited understanding of the transformation, focusing primarily on the first training example. The results from testing on both examples reveal significant discrepancies. The code fails to correctly reproduce the output grids, missing key elements of the transformation logic. The primary issue seems to be an incorrect reconstruction of the output grid, with many misplaced or missing pixels, especially in the added columns and rows. The strategy should be to:

1.  **Re-examine the transformation:** Carefully analyze the input-output pairs of both examples to identify the *complete* set of rules governing the transformation.
2.  **Identify Misconceptions:** Pinpoint the specific assumptions in the current code that are incorrect. For example, the assumption about hardcoded values for plane2 (5 in example 1 and 2 in example 2) and how the planes were constructed and used to construct the output grid.
3.  **Refine the Algorithm:** Rewrite the natural language program to reflect a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the transformation.
4.  **Revise the code**: Update the function by focusing first on identifying the correct "building blocks" (planes) and then construct the correct sequence of operations on those planes.

**Gather Metrics**

Let's use code execution to verify some basic assumptions and gather more information. I want to check a basic assumption of what values are in the plane.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
example1:
  input:
    size: 5x5
    border_color: 2
    inner_color: 3
    center_color: 5
  output:
    size: 10x10
    colors: [2, 3, 5]
    pattern: |
        The input grid is replicated in the top-left corner of the output grid.
        Columns of the border, inner, and center colors are added to create building blocks.
        The overall layout appears to combine these blocks, using mirroring and symmetry.

example2:
  input:
    size: 5x5
    border_color: 9
    inner_color: 8
    center_color: 2
  output:
    size: 10x10
    colors: [9, 8, 2]
    pattern: |
        Similar to example1, the input grid is replicated in the top-left.
        Columns of the border, inner, and center colors are added to create building blocks.
        The layout uses these in a symmetric fashion.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Colors:** Determine the border color (top-left pixel), inner color (any pixel different from the border and center), and center color (the center pixel) of the input 5x5 grid.

2.  **Create Building Blocks (Planes):**
    *   **Plane 1:** A copy of the original 5x5 input grid.
    *   **Plane 2:** A 5x1 column filled with the `border_color`.
    *   **Plane 3:** A 5x1 column filled with the `inner_color`.
    *   **Plane 4:** A 5x1 column filled with the `center_color`.

3.  **Construct Top Half (Rows 0-4):**
    *   Place `Plane 1` in the top-left corner (0-4, 0-4).
    *   Place `Plane 2` at (0-4, 5).
    *   Place `Plane 4` at (0-4, 6).
    *   Place `Plane 3` at (0-4, 7).
    *    Place `Plane 2` at (0-4, 8).
    *    Place `Plane 4` at (0-4, 9).

4. **Construct Bottom Half (rows 5-9):**
    *   Place `Plane 4` at (5-9, 0).
    *   Place `Plane 4` at (5-9, 1).
    *   Place `Plane 4` at (5-9, 2).
    *    Place `Plane 3` at (5-9, 3)
    *    Place `Plane 4` at (5-9, 4).
    *   Place `Plane 3` at (5, 5).
    *   Place `Plane 3` at (6, 5).
    *   Place `Plane 3` at (7, 5).
    *   Place `Plane 3` at (8, 5).
    *   Place `Plane 4` at (9, 5).
    *   Place `Plane 3` at (7, 6).
    *   Place `Plane 3` at (8, 6).
    *   Place `Plane 2` at (9, 6).
    *    Place `Plane 3` at (8, 7).
    *   Place `Plane 2` at (9, 7).
    *    Place `Plane 2` at (9, 8)
    *    Place `Plane 4` at (9,9)

5. Return the constructed 10x10 grid.
