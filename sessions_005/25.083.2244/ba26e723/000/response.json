The dominant colors are yellow (4) and white (0), with magenta (6) appearing in the output. The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of yellow pixels (4) with magenta pixels (6) based on their position and possibly their neighbors. The overall grid structure (rows and columns) is preserved.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
