However, the conditions regarding row and column indices are not entirely correct and need refinement based on *all* provided examples, not just the first. The strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Analyze all examples:** Examine the input, expected output, and transformed output of *every* example.\n2.  **Identify discrepancies:** Pinpoint exactly where the `transformed output` differs from the `expected output`.\n3.  **Refine the rule:** Adjust the row/column conditions in the natural language program and subsequently the code to match the observed behavior across all examples.\n4. Consider edge cases\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations:**\n\nI'll use a manual approach, guided by the provided results, to derive my observations, then consolidate the facts in a YAML format\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on discrepancies:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input has yellow at (0,0), (0,2), (0,4)... all even columns on row 0, these should change and do\n    *   row 1, column 0 changes when it shouldn't, col 2 doesn't when it should\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    * row 0 col 3 should turn to 6, does not.\n    *   row 1 col 2, 6 should turn to 6, does not\n\n*   **Example 3:** similar errors to example 1\n\n*   **Example 4:** similar errors\n\n*    **Example 5** similar errors\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
