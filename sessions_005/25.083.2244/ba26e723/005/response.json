Iterate: Go through each pixel in the input grid, one by one, examining its row and column position, and its color.\n2. Identify Yellow Pixels: Check if the current pixel's color is yellow (value 4).\n3. Conditional Transformation:\n    *   If the pixel is yellow (4), check the following:\n        *    If the pixel is at an even-numbered row AND an even-numbered column, change its color to magenta (6).\n        *    If the pixel is at an odd-numbered row AND an even-numbered column AND the column index is *not* a multiple of 4, then change its color to magenta(6).\n4. Preserve Other Colors: If the pixel's color is *not* yellow (4), keep its original color value unchanged.\n5. Output: The output grid has the same dimensions (number of rows and columns) as the input grid.  Every pixel in the output grid is determined by applying the above rules to the corresponding pixel in the input grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)  # Initialize with a copy of the input\n    rows, cols = output_grid.shape\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Check if the pixel is Yellow\n            if output_grid[r, c] == 4:\n                if (r % 2 == 0) and (c % 2 == 0):\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 6\n                elif (r % 2 != 0) and (c % 2 == 0) and (c % 4 != 0):\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 6\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
