The output grid is always 9x9.\n*   **Transformation:** The core operation seems to be a combination of duplication and padding. The input grid appears to be replicated, and then zero-padding is added to achieve the final 9x9 size. The arrangement of the replication and padding varies between examples.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
