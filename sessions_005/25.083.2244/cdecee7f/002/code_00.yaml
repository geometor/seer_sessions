    objects:
      - name: "non-zero pixels"
        properties:
          - "value is not equal to 0"
          - "have a row and column coordinate in the input grid"
    actions:
      - "extraction"

  - description: "Extracted pixels are reordered and placed into a smaller output grid."
    objects:
      - name: "output grid"
        properties:
          - "smaller than or equal to the input grid in dimensions"
          - "contains all non-zero pixels from the input grid"

      - "reordering"
      - "placement"
  
  - description: "The output grid size is close to a square formed by all the non-zero pixels"
    objects:
