objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: variable (input and output have different dimensions)
      elements: single-digit integers (0-9, representing colors)
      features:
        - contiguous blocks of the same color form objects
        - objects have different shapes and sizes

transformations:
  - type: expansion
    details: output grid is larger than the input grid
  - type: repetition
    details: input elements (colors) are repeated in the output
  - type: arrangement
    details: the arrangement of colors in the output follows a specific pattern, possibly mirroring, repeating, or a combination of patterns, related to the input grid.

relationships:
  - input grid elements map to output grid elements based on color
  - output grid dimensions related to the input grid
