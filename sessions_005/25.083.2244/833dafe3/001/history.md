Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output pairs and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** The input consists of a rectangular grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. There are distinct objects formed by contiguous blocks of the same color.
*   **Output:** The output is also a rectangular grid of single-digit integers. It appears to be an expanded version of the input, with a specific pattern of repetition and arrangement of the input colors. The output grid seems to be generated by inverting, mirroring, or repeating the input.
*    The dimensions are different
*    The objects of the same color are adjacent to each other, there are no gaps

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: variable (input and output have different dimensions)
      elements: single-digit integers (0-9, representing colors)
      features:
        - contiguous blocks of the same color form objects
        - objects have different shapes and sizes

transformations:
  - type: expansion
    details: output grid is larger than the input grid
  - type: repetition
    details: input elements (colors) are repeated in the output
  - type: arrangement
    details: the arrangement of colors in the output follows a specific pattern, possibly mirroring, repeating, or a combination of patterns, related to the input grid.

relationships:
  - input grid elements map to output grid elements based on color
  - output grid dimensions related to the input grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze Input:** Take the input grid and identify each distinct object using the criteria that is a contiguous block of the same color.

2.  **Reverse Input:** Reverse the rows and the columns of the input grid.

3.  **Combine:** Create a new grid by taking the x-axis mirror of the reversed grid, and the original reversed grid, and adding a copy of the original input x axis mirrored, on top.

4. **Frame**: surround the entire construction by it's x-axis mirrored image.

In simpler terms: The transformation takes the input, reverses the input by inverting rows and columns, combines the x-axis mirrored image of this result with itself, add a copy of the mirrored input on top of it, and surrounds it with its mirror image.
