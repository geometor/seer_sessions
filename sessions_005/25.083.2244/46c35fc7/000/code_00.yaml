facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have identical dimensions."
  - observation: "The digit '7' (orange) predominantly remains unchanged."
  - observation: "Non-7 digits are re-arranged."
  - observation: "Transformation is not a simple arithmetic operation on values."
  - object: "Input Grid"
    properties:
      - type: "2D array of integers"
      - dimensions: "Variable, but consistent within a task"
  - object: "Output Grid"
    properties:
      - type: "2D array of integers"
      - dimensions: "Matches Input Grid"
  - object: "Digit '7'"
    properties:
      - role: "Possible background/static element"
  - object: "Non-7 Digits"
    properties:
      - role: "Elements subject to transformation"
    actions:
      - "Rearrangement/Sorting"
    relationships:
      -  "Adjacent to '7' and other non-7 digits."
      - "Positions change relative to each other and to '7'."
