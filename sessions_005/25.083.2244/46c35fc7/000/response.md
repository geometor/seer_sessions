Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another grid of the same dimensions. The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple arithmetic on the numbers themselves. Instead, it looks like a re-arrangement or "sorting" of the digits within specific regions or perhaps based on their adjacency to other digits. The digit '7' (orange) appears to be a static/background element, remaining unchanged in most cases. The transformation seems focused on the non-7 digits. There's a possible vertical or horizontal mirroring/flipping aspect, or potentially swapping based on their position relative to each other.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have identical dimensions."
  - observation: "The digit '7' (orange) predominantly remains unchanged."
  - observation: "Non-7 digits are re-arranged."
  - observation: "Transformation is not a simple arithmetic operation on values."
  - object: "Input Grid"
    properties:
      - type: "2D array of integers"
      - dimensions: "Variable, but consistent within a task"
  - object: "Output Grid"
    properties:
      - type: "2D array of integers"
      - dimensions: "Matches Input Grid"
  - object: "Digit '7'"
    properties:
      - role: "Possible background/static element"
  - object: "Non-7 Digits"
    properties:
      - role: "Elements subject to transformation"
    actions:
      - "Rearrangement/Sorting"
    relationships:
      -  "Adjacent to '7' and other non-7 digits."
      - "Positions change relative to each other and to '7'."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Static Elements:** Treat all '7' digits as static. Their positions in the output grid will be the same as in the input grid.

2.  **Isolate Non-Static Elements:** Focus on the digits other than '7'.

3. **Column-wise mirroring of the non-7 elements:** For each column create a collection of the non-7 numbers. Then for the current column, take the collection and reverse the order. Iterate through the reversed collection and place these back in the output grid from top to bottom for each column.

In summary, the rule appears to preserve '7's and reverse the order of the other numbers within each column.
