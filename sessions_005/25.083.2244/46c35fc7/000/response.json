The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple arithmetic on the numbers themselves. Instead, it looks like a re-arrangement or \"sorting\" of the digits within specific regions or perhaps based on their adjacency to other digits. The digit '7' (orange) appears to be a static/background element, remaining unchanged in most cases. The transformation seems focused on the non-7 digits. There's a possible vertical or horizontal mirroring/flipping aspect, or potentially swapping based on their position relative to each other.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Then for the current column, take the collection and reverse the order. Iterate through the reversed collection and place these back in the output grid from top to bottom for each column.\n\nIn summary, the rule appears to preserve '7's and reverse the order of the other numbers within each column.\n"
