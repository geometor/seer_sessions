objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - shape: variable (rows, cols)

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - shape: (2 * input_rows, 2 * input_cols)

  - name: colored_pixels
    type: list of tuples
    properties:
      - elements: (row, col, color) - coordinates and color of non-black pixels

actions:
  - name: replicate_pixels
    description: Copy colored pixels from input to output grid.
    rules:
      - Maintain original position.
      - Create a second copy horizontally offset by half the output grid width.

  - name: add_azure_border
    description: Fill specific cells in the output grid with azure (8).
    rules:
      - If a cell in output is empty (value is 0), fill the pixel if the row or
        column is even, and under certain conditions the row + column mod 2 = 0
        is also a condition.
      - Reviewing the patterns, the correct rule appears to be that every other
        column and row is checked to ensure we don't fill a pixel that
        contains a value copied over from the input

  - name: double_grid_size
    description: The output grid's dimensions are twice the input grid's dimensions.
