However, the azure border logic is incorrect, and the replication logic doesn't fully match all examples. The main issues are the inconsistent placement of the azure pixels and the handling of the additional copies of colored pixels. The strategy will be to correct the azure border logic based on all examples and adjust the replication logic.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nI'll use code execution to check the input and output grid sizes and confirm observations.\n\n"
