            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code performs reasonably well, capturing the core concept of doubling the grid size and replicating colored pixels. However, there are errors in the placement of the replicated pixels and the application of the azure (8) border. The code sometimes misses replicating pixels in the correct second location and incorrectly places azure pixels. The strategy will be to:\n\n1.  **Verify and correct pixel replication logic:** Ensure the replicated pixels are placed at the correct offset (half the width of the *output* grid) and replicated correctly on additional rows when the output is taller.\n2.  **Refine azure border logic:** The current logic places azure pixels only at even row and column indices. Examine the examples carefully to determine the precise rule for azure pixel placement. It's not a simple even/even rule.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Information**\n\nI'll use manual inspection and analysis to understand and describe the errors, no need to calculate exact coordinate differences right now. I will create a YAML block and a natural language program after analyzing the examples and the results, then move on to coding.\n\n**Example Analysis**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 5x3, Output: 10x6. Two yellow (4) pixels.\n    *   Error: Incorrect azure placement and incorrect secondary yellow placement\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 3x4, Output: 6x8. Two magenta (6) pixels.\n    *   Error: Incorrect azure placement and incorrect secondary magenta placement\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 4x4, Output: 8x8. One red (2) pixel.\n    *   Correct.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: 2x4, Output: 4x8. One gray (5) pixel.\n    *    Correct\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

The azure pixels appear to form an irregular border, not strictly on even rows and columns. Azure is placed in the first column and first row only if the cell is still black, and is placed intermittently throughout.\n\nBased on the examples, there seems to be a pattern.\nIn even columns, the azure appears every other row starting from 0.\nIn odd columns the pattern is not obvious.\n"
