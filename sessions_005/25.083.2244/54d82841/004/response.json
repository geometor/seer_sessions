            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and results to refine the natural language program and the subsequent code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were on the right track, focusing on vertical lines. However, the execution reveals a misunderstanding of *precisely* when and where to place the yellow pixel. The original program seems to place yellow at the bottom of the grid *only* if there is a full-height line, but the results suggest we must only consider if the penultimate row and all previous consecutive vertical pixels are the same, non-zero color.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Line Detection:** The `get_vertical_lines` function almost works, but needs modification to only consider the columns.\n2.  **Precise Yellow Placement:** Modify the `transform` function to:\n    *   Check only in columns with vertical lines as detected in the current function.\n    *   Yellow is placed if the vertical line is present in the grid, reaching the second to last row and all having the same, non-zero color.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Evidence:**\n\nI'll use a conceptual analysis here; I don't need `tool_code` for this specific analysis, as the provided outputs are very explicit about the errors.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Error: Yellow pixel missing at (4, 2).\n    *   Reason: The code likely checks for a *complete* vertical line from row 0 to row 3, while it should be placing the yellow at the bottom if the column reaches row 3.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Error: Yellow pixels missing at (7, 2) and (7, 6).\n    *   Reason: Same as Example 1. The columns have lines.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *Error: Yellow pixel at the incorrect location: (4,6)\n    *Reason: There are non-contiguous lines in the column. It only checks for a line existing, not its position reaching up to the penultimate row.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
