The color 5 (gray) is prominent in the output.\n*   **Dominant Colors:** Green (3) and Red (2) are prevalent in the input. White (0) is present as background. The output seems to simplify and abstract the input, focusing on the locations of Green (3) relative to Red (2) and replacing them with Gray(5).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Because input grids have multiple rows, consider \"left\" as the same row, or any row above.\n\n3. **Simplify and Create Gray Regions:** From the top-left, find the most-up-and-left green pixel. Trace a diagonal down-and-right using the green pixels location as a starting point, and replace all green with gray. If a red pixel exist on the diagonal down-and-right of the green pixel, also replace the red with gray.\n\n4. **Background:** Preserve or fill the remaining cells with white (0).\n\nIn essence, the transformation extracts the core spatial relationship between 'green' and 'red' regions and converts the shapes into gray blocks, retaining relative locations and creating a minimalist gray on white representation.\n"
