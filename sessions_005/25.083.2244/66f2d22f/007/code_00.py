"""
1.  **Initialize Output:** Create a 4x7 output grid filled with white (0) pixels.

2.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the top-leftmost green (3) pixel and the top-leftmost red (2) pixel within the input grid.

3.  **Determine Diagonal:**
    -   Calculate `row_diff` and `col_diff` which are the differences in row and column indices between the top-left *green* and top-left *red* pixels.
    -   The starting point of the gray (5) diagonal is determined by a calculation, not the input location, and will vary by example.
    -   The length and direction (slope) varies by example, also. The path of the diagonal may "wrap" around the boundaries of the 4x7 output grid.

4.  **Construct Diagonal:** Create the gray diagonal line in the output grid, starting at a calculated start position, and extending with calculated length.

5.  **Conditional Replacement:** Iterate through all pixels in the output. If the pixel is grey and is also the coordinate of a red pixel, replace the gray pixel in the output.

6.  **Output:** Return the 4x7 output grid.
