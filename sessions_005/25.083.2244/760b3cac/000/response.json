Both grids have the same dimensions (6x9 in the examples). The grids contain single-digit integers (0, 4, and 8), representing different colors.  The primary colors involved seem to be azure (8) and yellow (4), with white (0) as the background. The core operation appears to be some form of selective modification or movement of the azure (8) pixels, while the yellow (4) pixels remain unchanged. The change of azure positions seems to depend on its initial position.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Copy them directly.\n3.  **Conditional Azure Movement:** The core logic affects azure pixels, we can split azure pixels in 2 categories, isolated and connected. An isolated azure pixel has less than 2 adjacent azure pixels.\n4.  **Transformation Rule:** For isolated azure (8) pixels check if is possible put it at left, otherwise put it at right. The connected azure pixels is mirrored vertically.\n\n"
