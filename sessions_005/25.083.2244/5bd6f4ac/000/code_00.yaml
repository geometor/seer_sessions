facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Output grids are consistently 3x3.
  - observation: Output grid values are a subset of the input grid values.
  - observation: Output grid appears to be a transformed "view" from the input grid.
  - relationship: The output is a sub-grid of the input.
  - property: Input grid dimensions vary.
  - property: Output grid dimensions are constant (3x3).
  - action: Extraction of a 3x3 sub-grid.
  - action: Sub-grid selection logic, that copies values starting from the right corner.
