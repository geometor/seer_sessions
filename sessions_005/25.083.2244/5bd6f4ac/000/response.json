The sub-grid seems to be consistently 3x3. The elements within the subgrid may not be unique, but they are a subset of elements in the input grid. The position of the selected 3x3 sub-grid appears related to non-zero values in the input, and most importantly, the location changes within the task examples. The values in output grids do *not* appear to be a direct slice of any part of the input grid. It appears that sub-grid extraction begins on the upper right 3x3 part of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts**\n\n"
