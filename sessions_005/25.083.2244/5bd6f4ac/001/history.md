Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements of the Task**

The task appears to involve extracting a specific sub-grid from the input grid. The sub-grid seems to be consistently 3x3. The elements within the subgrid may not be unique, but they are a subset of elements in the input grid. The position of the selected 3x3 sub-grid appears related to non-zero values in the input, and most importantly, the location changes within the task examples. The values in output grids do *not* appear to be a direct slice of any part of the input grid. It appears that sub-grid extraction begins on the upper right 3x3 part of the input grid.

**YAML Documentation of Facts**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Output grids are consistently 3x3.
  - observation: Output grid values are a subset of the input grid values.
  - observation: Output grid appears to be a transformed "view" from the input grid.
  - relationship: The output is a sub-grid of the input.
  - property: Input grid dimensions vary.
  - property: Output grid dimensions are constant (3x3).
  - action: Extraction of a 3x3 sub-grid.
  - action: Sub-grid selection logic, that copies values starting from the right corner.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Locate Sub-grid Start:** Start the scan from the upper right of input grid.
2.  **Extract 3x3 Sub-grid**: Construct the output by copying 3 rows and 3 columns from the input. The scan of rows and columns starts from top to bottom and right to left, respectively.

In essence, the transformation identifies the starting point of a 3x3 subgrid within the input grid. Then it reconstructs that section into new grid.
