The output grids seem to be smaller than or equal to the corresponding input grids in size.\u00a0 The input grids consist of two distinct sections, separated by a row of 7s.\u00a0 The top section primarily contains the color red (2) and the bottom section contains the color magenta (6). The output grid appears to be derived solely from the structure of the input and seems to be related to identifying shapes. The key transformation is the appearance of the azure color (8) replacing some of the non-zero colors.\u00a0 The lower section of the input appears to be more directly related to what forms the output grid in each case.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts**\n\n"
