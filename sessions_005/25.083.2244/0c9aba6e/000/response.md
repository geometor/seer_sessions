Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements**

The task involves transforming input grids of varying sizes containing digits 0-9 (representing colors) into output grids, also containing digits 0-9. The output grids seem to be smaller than or equal to the corresponding input grids in size.  The input grids consist of two distinct sections, separated by a row of 7s.  The top section primarily contains the color red (2) and the bottom section contains the color magenta (6). The output grid appears to be derived solely from the structure of the input and seems to be related to identifying shapes. The key transformation is the appearance of the azure color (8) replacing some of the non-zero colors.  The lower section of the input appears to be more directly related to what forms the output grid in each case.

**YAML Documentation of Facts**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are divided into two sections.
    evidence: A horizontal line of 7s separates the input grid.
  - observation: The top section primarily contains the color red (2).
    evidence: Examining input grids shows mostly 2s above the separator.
  - observation: The bottom section primarily contains the color magenta (6).
    evidence: Examining input grids shows mostly 6s below the separator.
  - observation: The output grid contains the color azure (8) in place of the original colors in the input grid.
  - observation: The output appears to be related to the structure/shapes from the bottom half of the input.
  - observation: Output grids have different size, but are always smaller or same as the input grids.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Input Sections:** Divide the input grid into two sections based on the horizontal line of 7s. Discard the top section.

2.  **Process Bottom Section:** Analyze the bottom section of the input grid.

3.  **Create the output grid:** Identify "L" shapes formed by continuous blocks of magenta (6) pixels in the bottom section.

4. **Replace with Azure:**  For each identified "L" shape, replace the corresponding pixels in the output grid with azure (8).

5.  **Fill Remaining:** Any cell in the output grid not part of an identified "L" shape should be filled with black (0).

The core concept seems to extract and transform specific magenta "L" shapes located in the bottom half of the input and convert them to azure in the output grid.
