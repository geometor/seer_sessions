facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same height.
  - observation: Rows with all zeros are unchanged.
  - observation: Non-zero rows in the output are twice the width of the corresponding input rows.
  - observation: The order and values of non-zero pixels within a row are maintained during expansion.
  - observation: The expanded output is accomplished by duplicating the input sequence
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - relationship: output_grid is a transformation of input_grid
  - action: expand_row
    description: Doubles the width of a non-zero row by duplicating its pixels.
    input: row (list of integers)
    output: expanded_row (list of integers)
