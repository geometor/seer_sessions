Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to operate on specific rows within the grid.  The primary change appears to be an expansion of the width of non-zero rows, doubling their original size. Rows containing all zeros remain unchanged. The height of each row and color values are unaffected.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same height.
  - observation: Rows with all zeros are unchanged.
  - observation: Non-zero rows in the output are twice the width of the corresponding input rows.
  - observation: The order and values of non-zero pixels within a row are maintained during expansion.
  - observation: The expanded output is accomplished by duplicating the input sequence
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - relationship: output_grid is a transformation of input_grid
  - action: expand_row
    description: Doubles the width of a non-zero row by duplicating its pixels.
    input: row (list of integers)
    output: expanded_row (list of integers)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.
2.  **Check** if the row contains only zeros.
3.  **If** the row contains only zeros, keep the row identical in the output grid.
4.  **Else** (if the row contains any non-zero values), **double** the width of
    the row.
5. Create a new, expanded row where the original sequence is duplicated once
   (copy the values and append).
6.  **Place** the expanded row in the corresponding position in the output grid.
7. Return output grid.
