The transformation seems to operate on specific rows within the grid.  The primary change appears to be an expansion of the width of non-zero rows, doubling their original size. Rows containing all zeros remain unchanged. The height of each row and color values are unaffected.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
