facts:
  - observation: |
      All output grids consist of a single column filled with black pixels (color 0).
  - observation: |
      The height of the output grid varies and does not directly correspond to the height of the input grid.
  - observation: |
      Input grids contain only two colors: 0 (black) and 5 (gray).
  - relationship:
      example_1:
        input_height: 7
        output_height: 3
        rows_with_gray: 7
      example_2:
        input_height: 3
        output_height: 2
        rows_with_gray: 3
      example_3:
        input_height: 9
        output_height: 5
        rows_with_gray: 9
      example_4:
        input_height: 12
        output_height: 4
        rows_with_gray: 12
  - hypothesis: |
      The output grid's height corresponds to the number of contiguous blocks of gray (5) color, scanning top-to-bottom, and combining touching blocks, including diagonally.
