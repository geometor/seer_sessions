Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs are 2D grids of varying sizes, filled with single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.\n*   The dominant colors seem to be black (0) and gray (5).\n*   The outputs are also 2D grids, but significantly smaller than the inputs.\n*   All outputs consist solely of the color black (0).\n*\tThe output is a single column of 0 with a height equal to the number of gray object +1 or to the number of rows with any gray pixels.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
