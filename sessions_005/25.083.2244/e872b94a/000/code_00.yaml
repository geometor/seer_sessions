facts:
  - observation: |
      Inputs are rectangular grids of varying dimensions.
  - observation: |
      Outputs are single-column grids of zeros.
  - observation: |
      The height of the output grid seems related to the presence of gray (5) pixels in the input grid. It could correspond to the number of rows containing gray, or the number of distinct gray objects.
  - object: InputGrid
    properties:
      - color_values: [0-9]
      - shape: variable
  - object: OutputGrid
    properties:
      - color_values: [0]
      - shape: [n, 1]  # n rows, 1 column
  - relationship: |
