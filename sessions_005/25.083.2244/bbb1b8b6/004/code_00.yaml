objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - height: variable (4 in all examples)
      - width: variable (9 in all examples)
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7] (all observed colors)

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - height: same as input_grid
      - width: 4 (constant)
      - colors: subset of input_grid colors

  - name: blue_line
    type: vertical_line
    properties:
      - color: 1 (blue)
      - x_position: variable (can be -1 if not present)

  - name: gray_line
    type: vertical_line
    properties:
      - color: 5 (gray)
      - x_position: variable (always present)

  - name: transform_region
    type: grid
    properties:
      - origin: right of gray_line
      - width : variable, up to 4
      - height: same as input

actions:
  - name: find_blue_line
    description: Locate the leftmost vertical line of color 1.

  - name: find_gray_line
    description: Locate the leftmost vertical line of color 5.

  - name: extract_transform_region
    description: Extract the portion of the input grid to the right of the gray line.

  - name: copy_transform_region
    description: Copy up to four columns of the transform region to the output grid. If the blue line is at x=0, begins the copy at output column 1. If the blue line is not present or not at x=0, start copy at output column 0.
  - name: copy_to_output
    description: Copy columns to output grid, with specific rules based on the position of blue line

  - name: fill
    description:  If the copied transform region does not fill the output grid's width, then we fill the remaining columns. If the blue line was at x=0, the columns between the blue and gray line are repeated. Otherwise, the columns between the blue and grey line are repeated *if* there is a blue line.
