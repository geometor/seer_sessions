Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The core element appears to be a consistent transformation based on specific color regions within the input grid.  The input grids always seem to contain a vertical line of blue (1) pixels on the left and a single vertical line of gray (5) pixels. All output grids are 4 pixels wide. The regions to the right of the gray (5) pixels appear to be the trigger for the transformation. These regions seem to get mapped, moved to the output adjacent to the left side blue pixels, and the gray pixels disappear in the output.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - characteristic_column_1:  Always present, vertical, color blue (1), leftmost side
      - characteristic_column_2:  Always present, vertical, color gray (5), position varies
      - transform_region:  region to the right of the gray (5) pixels

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - width: 4
      - characteristic_column_1: Always present, vertical, color blue(1), leftmost side
      - content: derived from a transformation of the input_grid

  - actions:
    - name: transform_region
      description: The region to the right of the gray column in the input is extracted.
    - name: move_and_map
      description:  Move the transformed region to the output grid next to the left blue pixels
    - name: set_width
      description: The output width is always 4

  - relationships:
    - input_grid to output_grid: transformation based on color region extraction, moving, and mapping
    - transform_region location: always located to the right of the gray (5) vertical line.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Columns:** Locate the vertical blue (1) line on the left side of the input grid and the vertical gray (5) line.
2.  **Extract Transform Region:** Extract the rectangular region to the *right* of the gray (5) line.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** create a new grid with a width of 4.
4.  **Paste Left Side:**  Copy the blue (1) line to column 1 of the output grid.
5.  **Paste transform region**: Paste the content from the "transform\_region" to the output grid adjacent to the copied blue line, starting at column 2.
6. If the transform region is all zero, do nothing, leaving the default pixels
7.  **Fill the output**: if any rows of the new grid are less than 4 wide, fill the rest with values from input grid column 1.
