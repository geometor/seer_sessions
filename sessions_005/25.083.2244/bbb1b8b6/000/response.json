The input grids always seem to contain a vertical line of blue (1) pixels on the left and a single vertical line of gray (5) pixels. All output grids are 4 pixels wide. The regions to the right of the gray (5) pixels appear to be the trigger for the transformation. These regions seem to get mapped, moved to the output adjacent to the left side blue pixels, and the gray pixels disappear in the output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
