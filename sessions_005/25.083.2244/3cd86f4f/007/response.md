The transformation rule involves adding a variable number of columns filled with 0 (white) to both the left (prepend) and right (append) of the input grid. The number of zeros prepended and appended changes with each row, creating a diagonal effect.

1.  Determine Input Dimensions: Get the number of rows and columns of the input grid.
2.  Calculate Padding: For each row, calculate the number of zeros to prepend and append.  The left padding decreases incrementally for each subsequent row, while the right padding increases. The total number of added columns (left + right) is constant for all rows.
3.  Create Output Grid: Create a new grid filled with zeros, with dimensions determined by the input grid's dimensions plus the calculated padding.
4.  Place Input: Copy the input grid into the output grid, positioning it based on the calculated left padding for each row.  The position changes for each row.
