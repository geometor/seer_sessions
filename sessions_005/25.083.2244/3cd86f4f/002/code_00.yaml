observations:
  - object_types:
      - input_grid: A 2D array of integers representing colors.
      - output_grid: A 2D array of integers representing colors, larger than the input grid, and filled with '0' (white) except for the embedded input grid.
  - properties:
      - grid_dimensions: Each grid has a height (rows) and width (columns).
      - centering: The input grid is always placed at the center of the output grid.
      - background_color: The output grid's background color is always '0' (white).
      - output_size_increase: The difference between the output and input grid dimensions is always +2 in both rows and columns.
  - actions:
      - embedding: The input grid is embedded within the output grid.
      - centering_calculation:  The starting row and column for embedding are calculated to ensure centering.
