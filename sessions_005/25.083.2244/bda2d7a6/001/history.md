Okay, I'm ready to analyze these input-output pairs and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program description:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Objects:** The core objects are rectangular grids of pixels. Each pixel has a single color value (0-9). Within each grid, there appear to be larger rectangular regions of uniform color, forming a kind of "border" and an "inner rectangle." The border is always one pixel thick.
*   **Transformations:** It appears the transformation inverts the roles of the border and the inner rectangle. The color of the border in the input becomes the color of the inner rectangle in the output, and the *innermost* color of the input's inner rectangle becomes the color of the output's border.
* **Relationship:** The key relationship seems to be the spatial containment of the inner rectangle within the border. The colors "swap" roles based on the position.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - border_color: single value (0-9)
      - inner_rectangle_color: single value (0-9)
      - innermost_color : single value(0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: same as input_grid
      - border_color: derived from input_grid.innermost_color
      - inner_rectangle_color: derived from input_grid.border_color
  - action: color_swap
    description: Exchange colors between border and inner rectangle based on containment.
  - relationship: spatial_containment
    description: The inner rectangle is fully contained within the border.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Border:** In the input grid, determine the color of the outermost border (single-pixel-wide perimeter). Let's call this `input_border_color`.

2.  **Identify the Innermost Color**: Find the color that makes the border of the innermost part. Call this `innermost_color`.

3.  **Construct the Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.

4.  **Fill the output Border:** Set the color of the output grid's border (single-pixel-wide perimeter) to `innermost_color`.

5.  **Fill the Inner Rectangle:** Fill the remaining inner area of the output grid with the `input_border_color`.
