observations:
  - object: center_pixel
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      location: varies, but unique within each input grid
      purpose: defines the center of the cross
  - object: cross
    properties:
      shape: intersection of a vertical and horizontal line
      color: derived from the input grid, neighboring the center_pixel
      size: spans the entire output grid, edge to edge
  - task: transformation
    action: create a cross centered on the white pixel
    input_grid_size: varies per example (e.g., 5x5, 3x3, 7x7)
    output_grid_size: same as input_grid_size
    color_palette:  colors are consistent between input/output.
