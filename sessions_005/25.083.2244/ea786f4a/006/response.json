            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies the center '0' pixel and attempts to draw a cross using the surrounding color. However, it fails in cases where the cross extends beyond the immediate neighbors of the center '0'. Specifically, it seems to only draw lines to the edge of the \"input object\", not edge of the \"output grid\". The code worked perfectly on example two, and failed on one and three. Example 2's input and output were very similar, where 1 and 3 were very different. This is the biggest clue.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe core issue is that the code assumes the cross color fills *only the immediate surrounding* cells of the central '0'. The code needs to be modified to draw lines of the correct color *all the way to edges of the output grid*. The natural language program needs updating to better express this idea of \"extending to the edges.\"\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's use a code block to re-emphasize the core observations, in particular about size differences:\n\n"
