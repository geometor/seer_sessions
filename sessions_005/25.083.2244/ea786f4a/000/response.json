Here's my breakdown of the input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits, representing colored pixels.\n*   There's a single color in the input, besides a single '0' pixel, and the placement of that '0' is key.\n*   The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n*   The output maintains the original color in a cross/plus shape (+) centered on the location of the '0' in the input grid. The rest are replaced by '0's.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
