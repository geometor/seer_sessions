            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code focused on creating a cross centered on the '0' pixel, using the surrounding color. However, the test results reveal a flaw in this approach. While the code correctly identifies the center and attempts to draw a cross, it doesn't accurately replicate the expected output in all cases. The issue isn't the *position* of the cross, but the *propagation* of the color along the arms of the cross. The original program draws from the input, however it is the output that needs to mirror the cross.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe core concept of a cross centered on the '0' pixel remains valid. The key adjustment is to ensure the cross's color fills the entire arm, stopping only when it reaches the edge of the grid or another color (in this case, a zero). We need to extend cross, not based on input, but to fill the available output.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using provided results, no code execution needed):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 5x5 grid, '0' at (2, 2), surrounding color '2' (red).\n    *   Expected Output: Cross of '2' with '0' at the corners and center.\n    *   Transformed Output: Cross of '2', but with the color does not fully extend\n    *   Issue: The code colors the pixels according the the input grid, so the color doesn't extend correctly.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid, '0' at (1, 1), surrounding color '1' (blue).\n    *   Expected Output: Cross of '1' with '0' at the corners.\n    *   Transformed Output: almost correct, but the horizontal line is fully colored 1.\n    *   Issue: very similar to example 1\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 7x7 grid, '0' at (3, 3), surrounding color '3' (green).\n    *   Expected Output: Cross of '3' with '0' at the corners and every other pixel.\n    *   Transformed Output: Cross of '3', but the color does not extend correctly.\n    *   Issue: same as example 1\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
