objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents the initial state. Contains pixels of various colors.
    properties:
      - contains_zero: True # All input grids have at least one '0' pixel.

  - name: zero_pixel
    type: pixel
    description: The pixel with a value of '0', representing the center of the cross.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)

  - name: cross_pixel
    type: pixel
    description: Pixels that form the cross shape.
    properties:
      - color: Determined by the neighbors of the zero_pixel in the input_grid.

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents the transformed state. Contains a cross centered at the original zero_pixel location.
    properties:
      - dimensions: Same as input_grid.

actions:
  - name: find_center
    input: input_grid
    output: coordinates (row, col) of the zero_pixel
    description: Locates the '0' pixel within the input_grid.

  - name: determine_cross_color
    input: input_grid, zero_pixel coordinates
    output: color of the cross
    description: Determines the color of the cross by examining the immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) of the zero_pixel.

  - name: draw_cross
    input: output_grid, zero_pixel coordinates, cross_color
    output: modified output_grid
    description: Draws a cross on the output_grid with the specified color, centered at the zero_pixel coordinates. The cross extends to the edges of the grid.
