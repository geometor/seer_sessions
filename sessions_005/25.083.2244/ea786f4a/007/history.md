"""
1.  **Locate Center:** Find the coordinates (row, column) of the single '0' (white) pixel within the input grid. This pixel represents the center of the cross.

2.  **Identify Cross Color:** Examine the four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right) of the '0' pixel in the *input grid*. The color of the cross will be the color that is present in the neighboring pixels. If multiple different colors are present, pick any of them (needs further refinement if additional tests show conflicts).

3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid (output grid) with the same dimensions as the input grid. Initialize all pixels in the output grid to '0' (white).

4.  **Draw Cross:**
    *   Draw a vertical line using the cross color, passing through the center point, extending from the top edge to the bottom edge of the output grid.
    *   Draw a horizontal line using the cross color, passing through the center point, extending from the left edge to the right edge of the output grid.
    *  Set center pixel to '0'

5. **Return output grid**

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies the center '0' pixel and attempts to draw a cross using the surrounding color. However, it fails in cases where the cross extends beyond the immediate neighbors of the center '0'. Specifically, it seems to only draw lines to the edge of the "input object", not edge of the "output grid". The code worked perfectly on example two, and failed on one and three. Example 2's input and output were very similar, where 1 and 3 were very different. This is the biggest clue.

**Strategy:**

The core issue is that the code assumes the cross color fills *only the immediate surrounding* cells of the central '0'. The code needs to be modified to draw lines of the correct color *all the way to edges of the output grid*. The natural language program needs updating to better express this idea of "extending to the edges."

**Metrics and Observations:**

Let's use a code block to re-emphasize the core observations, in particular about size differences:

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
observations:
  - object: center_pixel
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      location: varies, but unique within each input grid
      purpose: defines the center of the cross
  - object: cross
    properties:
      shape: intersection of a vertical and horizontal line
      color: derived from the input grid, neighboring the center_pixel
      size: spans the entire output grid, edge to edge
  - task: transformation
    action: create a cross centered on the white pixel
    input_grid_size: varies per example (e.g., 5x5, 3x3, 7x7)
    output_grid_size: same as input_grid_size
    color_palette:  colors are consistent between input/output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate the Center:** Find the single white (0) pixel within the input grid. This is the center point of the cross.

2.  **Identify the Cross Color:** Examine the immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right) of the white pixel in the *input* grid. The color of the cross will be any non-zero color found among those neighbors.

3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid (the output grid) with the same dimensions as the input grid. Initialize all pixels to white (0).

4.  **Draw the Cross:**
    *   Draw a vertical line of the identified cross color, centered on the column of the white pixel, extending from the top edge to the bottom edge of the output grid.
    *   Draw a horizontal line of the identified cross color, centered on the row of the white pixel, extending from the left edge to the right edge of the output grid.

5.  **Reset Center:** Set the pixel at the original white pixel's location to be white (0) in the *output* grid.

6.  **Return:** Return the modified output grid.
