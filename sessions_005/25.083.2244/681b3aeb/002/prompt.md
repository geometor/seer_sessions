"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid and identify all distinct, contiguous blocks of non-zero (non-white) colored pixels. Each of these blocks is considered an object.
2.  **Object columns** Iterate through the identified objects, taking one object at a time.
3. **Create result array.** Starting with an empty array, append each object's color values to the result array, in a column sorted by object order as they appear in the columns, starting from the upper right corner, then left, then down.
4.  **Arrange in Output Grid:** Construct a new, smaller output grid. First object goes in the last column, other objects are to its left. The row index starts from the bottom of the array, and for each distinct object it goes up. The colors are aligned on the right and bottom.
