"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels. Each block is an object.
2.  **Object Properties:** Determine the shape and color of each object.
3.  **Tiling:** The transformation involves arranging the objects in a tiled manner to create the output grid. Objects are arranged without overlapping, like puzzle pieces. The target grid dimension is 3x3 for all training examples.
4. Determine the object that goes on the top left: The object with most number of pixels gets placed on the top-left of the grid.
5. Place remaining objects: For each remaining object, iterate over their pixels, and fill them to the output grid at the corresponding indexes. If the index does not exist, extend the output grid.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the results and a plan to improve the natural language program and subsequently the code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, focusing on object identification and tiling. However, the results clearly show it's not handling all cases correctly. The primary issues seem to be:

1.  **Incorrect Tiling Logic:** The code attempts to tile objects based on size, simply placing the largest first and then adding others. This works in a very limited sense but doesn't capture the actual transformation rule, as objects can be anywhere in any order.
2.  **Output Grid Size:** The code isn't consistently producing the correct 3x3 output grid size, sometimes producing smaller or bigger, showing the transformation logic is incorrect.
3.  **Z Order**: The original natural language program does not properly describe the z-ordering, which is important for the transformation, resulting in colors appearing "under" other colors that overlap them.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-evaluate the Core Transformation:** Instead of just tiling, we need to identify a more precise relationship between the input objects and their arrangement in the output. It's important to examine the relative positions of the objects.
2.  **Refine Object Properties:** Consider if additional object properties (beyond just shape and color) are relevant. Relative position within the input grid, or some form of ordering, might be important.
3.  **Improve the Natural Language Program:** Use the new insights to rewrite the natural language program to be much more specific about *how* objects are selected and placed, and to make use of the full set of ARC-AGI priors.
4. **Update Code**: use the improved natural language program to generate a new version of the code.

**Gathering Metrics and Evidence:**

Let's analyze each example in more detail using some helper code.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels in the input grid. Each block represents an object. Record the shape, color, size, and relative position of each object.

2.  **Order Objects and Rotate:** The objects found in the input are re-arranged to form a 3x3 grid for the output.
    - find cross shape - it always becomes the top row
    - find vertical bar - it always becomes the left most column
    - find L shape - place remaining pixels

3. **Z Order:** objects are ordered in the output by placing the top row first, then the left column, then any additional objects.

4.  **Output Grid:** The output grid is always 3x3, if there are not enough pixels, they will be arranged at the top left, if there are too many, some may be discarded.
