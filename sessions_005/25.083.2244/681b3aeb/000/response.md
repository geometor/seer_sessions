Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output).  The input grids contain background pixels (represented by 0, which is white) and colored objects.  The output grids appear to be constructed from the colored objects in the input, but rearranged and without any background pixels. It seems important to find colored objects, so that may mean any contiguous block of color.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - contains: background_pixels (0/white)
      - contains: colored_objects
        properties:
          - color: varies (e.g., yellow, blue, green)
          - shape: contiguous block (not always rectangular)

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - contains: reordered_input_objects

actions:
  - name: identify_objects
    description: Locate contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels.
  - name: reorder_objects
    description: Arrange the identified objects into a new, smaller grid.

relationships:
  - input_grid 'contains' colored_objects
  - output_grid 'is_derived_from' input_grid
  - output_grid 'contains' reordered_input_objects

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid and identify all distinct, contiguous blocks of non-zero (non-white) colored pixels. Each of these blocks is considered an object.
2.  **Object columns** Iterate through the identified objects, taking one object at a time.
3. **Create result array.** Starting with an empty array, append each object's color values to the result array, in a column sorted by object order as they appear in the columns, starting from the upper right corner, then left, then down.
4.  **Arrange in Output Grid:** Construct a new, smaller output grid. First object goes in the last column, other objects are to its left. The row index starts from the bottom of the array, and for each distinct object it goes up. The colors are aligned on the right and bottom.
