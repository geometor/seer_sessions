The most prominent feature is a horizontal line of azure (8) pixels that seems to divide the input grid into two regions. The output grid appears to be a compressed representation of select parts from the input grid, using a combination of colored blocks and blank areas. It looks like areas above and below the dividing line are extracted and combined.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Vertically stack those colored areas into a sub-grid, the same width as the number of non-azure and non-white columns.\n4. **Bottom:** For the section *below* the azure line: extract each colored pixel cluster (non-white, non-azure) within each column. Vertically stack those colored areas into a sub-grid, the same width as the number of non-azure and non-white columns.\n5.  **Combine:** Vertically concatenate the top sub-grid with the bottom sub-grid to create the output grid.\n\nIn essence, the transformation extracts colored regions from above and below the azure line, removes whitespace and the azure pixels themselves, and stacks the extracted colored areas to form the output grid. The rule can be interpreted as extracting information relative to the position of the azure line.\n"
