Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger input grid into a smaller output grid. The most prominent feature is a horizontal line of azure (8) pixels that seems to divide the input grid into two regions. The output grid appears to be a compressed representation of select parts from the input grid, using a combination of colored blocks and blank areas. It looks like areas above and below the dividing line are extracted and combined.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input grids are larger than output grids."
  - observation: "A horizontal line of azure (8) pixels spans the entire width of each input grid."
  - observation: "This azure line divides the input grid into two distinct regions: above and below."
  - observation: "The output grid seems to be a compressed composite of specific regions from the input."
  - observation: "Colors in the output grid are the same as the input grid."
  - observation: "Colors seem to maintain their relative positions from the input, but whitespace is changed and some color blocks are ignored"
  - observation: "The columns in the input containing color values above the azure line are compressed, ignoring the azure and white cells and taking the color values and repeating them, if multiples"
  - observation: "The columns in the input containing color values below the azure line are compressed, ignoring the azure and white cells and taking the color values and repeating them, if multiples"
  - observation: "The top portion of the output grid contains the top of the input grid and the lower portion of the output grid is the bottom of the input grid"
  - observation: "The rows in the input grid above and below the azure line correspond in number to the rows in the output grid."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the dividing line:** Locate the horizontal line of azure (8) pixels that spans the full width of the input grid.
2.  **Separate:** Divide the input grid conceptually into two sections: the part *above* the azure line and the part *below* the azure line.
3. **Top:** For the section above the azure line: extract each colored pixel cluster (non-white, non-azure) within each column. Vertically stack those colored areas into a sub-grid, the same width as the number of non-azure and non-white columns.
4. **Bottom:** For the section *below* the azure line: extract each colored pixel cluster (non-white, non-azure) within each column. Vertically stack those colored areas into a sub-grid, the same width as the number of non-azure and non-white columns.
5.  **Combine:** Vertically concatenate the top sub-grid with the bottom sub-grid to create the output grid.

In essence, the transformation extracts colored regions from above and below the azure line, removes whitespace and the azure pixels themselves, and stacks the extracted colored areas to form the output grid. The rule can be interpreted as extracting information relative to the position of the azure line.
