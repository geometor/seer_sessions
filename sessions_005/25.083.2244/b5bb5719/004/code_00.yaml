observations:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: variable
      columns: variable
      cells: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - object: row
    type: 1D array
    properties:
       cells: integers
       runs: list of (color, length) tuples

  - action: copy_row
    description: Copy a row from the input grid to the output grid.
    properties:
        source_row_index: integer
        destination_row_index: integer

  - action: transform_row
    description: Modify a row in the output grid based on runs in the input grid.
    properties:
      input_row_index: integer (for run analysis)
      output_row_index: integer (row to be modified)
      rules:
        - Iterate through runs in the input row.
        - The color of the current run in the first row determines what color will be used for an output run in the second row.
        - the *length* of the *previous* run, determines the *length* of the current output run,
        - if there is no previous run, use the background color of the output row (7/white).
        - The first run in the second output row uses the "background" value of the original, untransformed, row.
