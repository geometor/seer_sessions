objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
      properties:
        rows: number of rows
        columns: number of columns
        colors: mapping of digits to colors

observations:
  - row_invariance:
      description: First row of input grid is identical to first row of output grid.
      rows: [0]
  - row_invariance_7:
      description: all rows other than the first two in the input are all 7s, and remain all 7s in the output.
  - row_transformation:
      description: Second row of input grid undergoes a complex transformation.

actions:
  - local_shift:
      description: color transformation in the second row

relationships:
  - spatial_dependency: Second row transformation depends on pixel values from the first row.
