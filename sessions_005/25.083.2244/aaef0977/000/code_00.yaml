facts:
  - observation: Input grids are 8x8 and filled mostly with '7' (orange).
  - observation: A single non-'7' digit appears in each input grid.
  - observation: Output grids are 8x8 and filled with various digits (0-9), representing a full color spectrum.
  - observation: The position of the single non-'7' digit in the input grid does not seem to determine any specific part of the output grid.
  - hypothesis: The transformation might be a fixed mapping to an 8x8 grid, independent of input.
  - hypothesis: The output may be a pre-defined constant 8x8 grid.
