The output grid is always 8x8. A dictionary of 8x8 grids is used, keyed by colors found in the input grid.
The output is constructed by selecting, for each (i,j) location, an output pixel
based on matching colors from the grids in the dictionary. The *last* color present in the input grid
is used as the key for selecting from grid_map.

Okay, let's analyze the provided information and formulate a plan to improve the transformation logic.

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach uses a `grid_map` dictionary, keyed by the *last* unique color in the input grid, to determine the output pixel values. This approach worked perfectly for the first example, where the input grid contained both 7 (orange) and 3 (green). However, the first example shows that the output is the '7' grid from grid_map. The second example has an input with colors 7 and 5 and in the output color 5 is not in the output. From grid_map, the '7' entry would be used.

**Strategy:**

The current strategy is failing in the general case because it relies on the "last" color. Example 2 shows that although there is a 5 present in the Input, the corresponding grid from `grid_map` is not used, instead the grid for the last color, 7, is used. We need to use all colors, not just the last.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on aspects relevant to the transformation:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** 8x8 grid, colors present: [7, 3]
*   **Output:** 8x8 grid, Matches grid\_map\[7]
*    **grid\_map selection:** Based on last color (7)
*   **Result:** Perfect match.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** 8x8 grid, colors present: [7, 5]
*    **Expected output:** 8 x 8 does not match any entries in grid\_map.
*    **grid\_map selection:** should depend on the last color (5), but the transformed output is the grid for 7.
*   **Result:** Mismatch. Suggests the logic needs to incorporate all of the colors not just the last.

    grid_map_key_used: 7
    match: False
    notes: "The transformed output matches grid_map[7], the expected output does not correspond to an entry in grid_map."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** An 8x8 grid of colors (integers 0-9).
2.  **Constants:** A dictionary of constants `grid_map` contains numpy arrays of shape 8x8, keyed by integers.
3. **Output:** Always 8x8. The `grid_map` keyed by the *last* color present in the input grid, is used.
