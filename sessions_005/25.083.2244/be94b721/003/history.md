Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to address the errors:

**General Assessment:**

The errors indicate a problem with how the output grid is being constructed. The message "setting an array element with a sequence" and "inhomogeneous shape" suggests that the code is trying to create a NumPy array where rows have different lengths. This likely stems from how pixels of the `target_color` are being extracted and added. The original strategy of selecting only the rightmost object is too restrictive and doesn't apply across all examples, and needs to be adapted to the nature of each example.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Examples:** Carefully examine each input-output pair to understand the specific transformation occurring.
2.  **Identify Object Selection Criteria:** The rule isn't just about the *rightmost* object. There may be other rules.
3.  **Correct Array Construction:** Ensure all rows in the output have the same length, use padding with zeros as necessary. The initial attempt to pad is not working as expected and causing the inhomogeneous error. We'll need to simplify it.

**Metrics and Example Analysis:**

Let's gather some metrics for each example, we will start with just a print of the input and output grid shape:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Object:** Find the contiguous block of non-black (non-zero) pixels. It can be a vertical or horizontal line.
2.  **Determine Action:**
    *   If target object is vertical, remove the bottom row.
    *   Remove all columns not containing the target object.
    *   Remove all rows not containing the target object.
3.  **Output:** A new grid containing only the target object with potential reduced rows (vertical lines) or columns (horizontal lines.)

The core issue with the previous code was that it was designed to select the "rightmost" object - which appeared correct, but did not correctly generalize. This new description addresses that error. The error in numpy was caused by trying to copy parts of rows into the object\_rows variable and the append operation to the object rows list - it made an inhomogeneous list. Instead, we should just calculate the bounding box, and use that to slice the section that we need.
