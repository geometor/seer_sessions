facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Output grids contain a single connected object.
  - observation: The background color (0) is always removed.
  - observation: The extracted object is non-zero pixels in input.
  - observation: In train_1, the azure object is selected and reshaped.
  - observation: In train_2, the yellow object is selected.
  - observation: In train_3, the red object is selected and reshaped.
  - observation: In train_4, the red object is selected and reshaped.
  - hypothesis: The transformation selects a single object based on its color and may reshape.
  - hypothesis: If an object of same color appears multiple times, the rightmost object is selected.
