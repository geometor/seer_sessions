objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      rows: variable
      columns: variable
      0: white pixel
      2: red pixel
      4: yellow pixel

actions:
  - name: identify_enclosed_regions
    input: grid
    process: |
        Locate contiguous regions of '0' (white) pixels.
        A region is considered enclosed if all its orthogonal neighbors are '2' (red) pixels.  Diagonal adjacency is *not* considered for enclosure.
    output: set of (row, column) tuples representing enclosed '0' pixels

  - name: fill_enclosed_regions
    input: grid, set of enclosed '0' pixel coordinates
    process: Change the value of all '0' pixels within enclosed regions to '4' (yellow).
    output: modified grid
