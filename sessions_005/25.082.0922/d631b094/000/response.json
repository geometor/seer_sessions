Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs are square grids of varying sizes (3x3 in the examples).\n*   Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color.\n*   The outputs are smaller rectangular grids.\n*   The outputs seem to be composed of the non-zero values from the input grids.\n*   The input grids have sparse data, many cells are zero.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
