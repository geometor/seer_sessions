facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: |
      Output grids retain some spatial relationships from the input, but are condensed.
  - observation: |
      Each example contains a rectangular object of a single color, completely contained in the input.
  - observation: |
      In all examples, a single color forms a border around all other colors.
  - observation: |
      The output always contains one color which forms a border surrounding other internal colors.
  - action: |
       A central object is defined for each input using the internal colored object.
  - action: |
       The largest square cross section is extracted from the central object.
  - action: |
      A border of the exterior color is added.
  - relationship: |
      The size of the output grid is related to the size of a central object in the input grid.
  - relationship: |
      Colors in the output come directly from colors in the input, one border color, one central color.
