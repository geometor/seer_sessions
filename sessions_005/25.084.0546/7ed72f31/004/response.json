            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the provided information and a strategy to address the discrepancies between the generated outputs and the expected outputs:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code captures some key aspects of the transformation, such as identifying objects and applying absorption based on adjacency. However, it fails to correctly model several crucial behaviors:\n\n1.  **Directional Absorption:** The absorption logic doesn't consistently respect the directionality implied in the examples. It seems that an object to the *right* of another object often absorbs it, not the other way around, and the color 2 acts differently.\n2.  **Color 2 Behavior**: The code attempts to model that Color 2 absorption logic isn't entirely right, and needs additional rules.\n3. **Object 3 Mirroring**: While attempted, the horizontal mirroring/extending for color 3 is not correctly implemented and depends on adjacent cells.\n4. **Complex Interactions:** The examples demonstrate more complex interactions where multiple absorptions and extensions might occur in a single transformation. The current code seems to apply transformations sequentially, which might not be the correct approach.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Interaction Rules:**\n    *   Clearly define the conditions under which one object absorbs another. Prioritize right-to-left absorption and special rules for color 2. The rule for color 3 is not a mirroring, rather an extension based on an adjacent object.\n2.  **Iterative Application:** Instead of applying all transformations at once, consider an iterative approach where the grid is updated after each absorption/extension, and the object detection is re-run. This might better reflect the cascading effects observed in the examples.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis for now, code execution would be used in a real environment):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains objects of color 1 (background), 3, 2, 4, 5, and 8.\n    *   **Expected Output:** Shows that 4 absorbs 1 on its left, 2 stays. The 3 on the top left is not changed, The 3 does horizontal extension/mirroring. 5 adjacent to 2 on the left is absorbed.\n    *   **Observed Errors:** Color 4 absorption not applied. Color 3 mirroring incorrect. Color 5 not properly absorbed.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains objects of color 8 (background), 2, 4, 1, and 3.\n    *   **Expected output:** Shows color 4 absorbing color 2 to its left. Color 3 extends horizontally. Shows color 2 absorbing color 1 on the left. Color 3 extends vertically.\n    * **Observed Errors:** Color 4 absorption incorrect, also absorbing pixels on its right when it should extend. Color 3 mirroring not applied. Color 2 absorbing adjacent color 1 incorrect.\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n\n"
