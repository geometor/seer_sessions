The transformations don't seem to involve simple color substitutions. Instead, there's a complex re-arrangement and grouping of pixels based on their original positions and colors.  It appears that connected regions of the *same* color in the input are being treated as single objects, and that regions of different colors are being used as a kind of \"background\" that is re-shaped in the output based on the shape of a \"foreground\" object. The shapes of some input objects do not exist at all in the output.\n\nIt seems that a few objects are selected in the input, and all others of the same color form into a kind of \"frame\", filling up all available positions in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In train\\_2 input, the green \"3\" transforms to the green \"3\" in the output.
