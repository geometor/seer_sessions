The context includes the colors of neighboring pixels, the position of the pixel within the grid (e.g., top rows, left edge), and the presence of specific color sequences.\n\n1.  **Identify Contiguous Blocks:** Find all contiguous blocks of the same color.\n\n2.  **Identify Sequences:** Find all horizontal and vertical sequences of 2 or more colors.\n\n3.  **Apply Replacement Rules:**\n    *   **Example 1 (Generalized):**\n        * Within contiguous blocks of color '8' adjacent to color '9', '8' is replaced based on the *relative position* of '8' and '9' within their respective blocks. If the '8' is on the edge of *its* block that borders a block of '9', then it may change to '3' or '4'. Further examples needed to determine exact rule for '3' versus '4'.\n        *   '9's that are adjacent to '8' blocks are transformed into a '3'.\n    *   **Example 2 (Generalized):**\n        *   In the top three rows, '5' is replaced by '2'.\n        *   On the left edge, '5' is replaced by '1', and '2' is replaced by '1'.\n        *   The sequence '5, 2, 2' is replaced by '2, 2, 2'.\n        *   The sequence '5, 2, 1' is replaced by '1, 1, 1'.\n    *   **Example 3 (Generalized):**\n        *   If '7' is followed by '8' (horizontally), the '7' becomes '6'.\n        *   If '8' is followed by '7' (horizontally), the '8' becomes... (needs further clarification) The '7' following the '8' becomes '5'.\n        *   The sequence '7, 8, 7' becomes '6, 8, 5'.\n\n4.  **Priority:** If multiple rules apply to a pixel, positional rules (top row, left edge) take precedence, followed by sequence rules, then adjacency.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_contiguous_blocks(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies contiguous blocks of the same color in the grid.\n    Returns a list of blocks, where each block is a list of (row, col) coordinates.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)\n    blocks = []\n\n    def dfs(row, col, color, block):\n        if (\n            row < 0\n            or row >= rows\n            or col < 0\n            or col >= cols\n            or visited[row, col]\n            or grid[row, col] != color\n        ):\n            return\n        visited[row, col] = True\n        block.append((row, col))\n        dfs(row + 1, col, color, block)\n        dfs(row -
