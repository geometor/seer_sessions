Focus particularly on changes occurring at the edges (beginning or end) of these blocks, both horizontally and vertically. Also identify 2 and 3 color sequences.\n\n2.  **Contextual Replacement:** The replacement of a pixel's color depends on its neighbors *and* its location within a contiguous block or a sequence.\n\n3.  **Specific Rules (Examples):**\n\n    *   **Example 1:** If a pixel with color '8' is adjacent to a block of '9's, it's replaced by '4' *or* '3'. The conditions determining '3' vs '4' are not fully clear from this single example.  If a '9' is adjacent to a block of '8's it is replaced by 3.\n\n    *   **Example 2:** If a pixel with color '5' is in the top section of the grid and part of a sequence, it is changed to a '2'. If it's on the left edge, it changes to a '1'. If a '2' is on the left edge, it is replaced with a '1'.\n        -  the sequence 5,2,2 becomes 2,2,2\n        -  the sequence 5,2,1 becomes 1,1,1\n\n    *   **Example 3:** \n        - If '7' is followed by '8', the '7' becomes '6'. \n        - If '8' is followed by '7', the '7' becomes '5'.\n        - The sequence '7 8 7' becomes '6 8 5'.\n\n4. The rules are not consistent across the examples. The replacements are highly context-dependent, and additional training data is required to establish a single, comprehensive rule.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_contiguous_blocks(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies contiguous blocks of the same color in the grid.\n    Returns a list of blocks, where each block is a list of (row, col) coordinates.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)\n    blocks = []\n\n    def dfs(row, col, color, block):\n        if (\n            row < 0\n            or row >= rows\n            or col < 0\n            or col >= cols\n            or visited[row, col]\n            or grid[row, col] != color\n        ):\n            return\n        visited[row, col] = True\n        block.append((row, col))\n        dfs(row + 1, col, color, block)\n        dfs(row - 1, col, color, block)\n        dfs(row, col + 1, color, block)\n        dfs(row, col - 1, color, block)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if not visited[r, c]:\n                block = []\n                dfs(r, c, grid[r, c], block)\n                blocks.append(block)\n    return blocks\n\n\ndef apply_example_1_rules(grid):\n    \"\"\"Applies the transformation rules observed in Example 1.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    output_grid = np.copy(grid)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r,c] == 8:\n                if c > 0 and grid[r,c-1] == 9:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 4\n                if c < cols - 1 and grid[r,c+1] == 9:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 4\n                if r>0 and grid[r-1,c] == 9:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 4\n                if r < rows -1 and grid[r+1,c] == 9:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 3 # NOTE: unclear from data which to choose!\n            if grid[r,c] == 9:\n                if c > 0 and grid[r,c-1] == 8:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 3\n                if c < cols - 1 and grid[r,c+1] == 8:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 3\n                if r>0 and grid[r-1,c] == 8:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 3\n                if r < rows -1 and grid[r+1,c] == 8:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 3\n    return output_grid\n\ndef apply_example_2_rules(grid):\n    \"\"\"Applies the transformation rules observed in Example 2.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    output_grid = np.copy(grid)\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Top section replacements\n            if r < 3:\n                if grid[r,c] == 5:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 2\n            # Left edge replacements\n            if c == 0:\n                if grid[r,c] == 5:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = 1\n                elif grid[r,c] == 2:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 1\n            # specific sequence changes:\n            if c+2 < cols:\n                if grid[r,c] == 5 and grid[r,c+1] == 2 and grid[r,c+2] == 2:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 2\n                    output_grid[r,c+1] = 2\n                    output_grid[r,c+2] = 2\n                if grid[r,c] == 5 and grid[r,c+1] == 2 and grid[r,c+2] == 1:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 1\n                    output_grid[r,c+1] = 1\n                    output_grid[r,c+2] = 1\n            if r+2 < rows:\n                if grid[r,c] == 5 and grid[r+1,c] == 2 and grid[r+2,c] == 1:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 1\n                    output_grid[r+1,c] = 1\n                    output_grid[r+2,c] = 1\n\n    return output_grid\n\ndef apply_example_3_rules(grid):\n    \"\"\"Applies the transformation rules observed in Example 3.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    output_grid = np.copy(grid)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if c+1 < cols:\n                if grid[r,c] == 7 and grid[r,c+1] == 8:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 6\n                if grid[r,c] == 8 and grid[r,c+1] == 7:\n                    output_grid[r,c+1] = 5\n            if c+2 < cols:\n                if grid[r,c] == 7 and grid[r,c+1] == 8 and grid[r,c+2] == 7:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 6\n                    output_grid[r,c+2] = 5\n    return output_grid\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = output_grid.shape\n\n    # Apply example-specific rules.
