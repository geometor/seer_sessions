The transformation rule is context-dependent and operates on sequences and contiguous blocks of colors.

1.  **Contiguous Block and Edge Detection:** Identify contiguous blocks of the same color.  Focus particularly on changes occurring at the edges (beginning or end) of these blocks, both horizontally and vertically. Also identify 2 and 3 color sequences.

2.  **Contextual Replacement:** The replacement of a pixel's color depends on its neighbors *and* its location within a contiguous block or a sequence.

3.  **Specific Rules (Examples):**

    *   **Example 1:** If a pixel with color '8' is adjacent to a block of '9's, it's replaced by '4' *or* '3'. The conditions determining '3' vs '4' are not fully clear from this single example.  If a '9' is adjacent to a block of '8's it is replaced by 3.

    *   **Example 2:** If a pixel with color '5' is in the top section of the grid and part of a sequence, it is changed to a '2'. If it's on the left edge, it changes to a '1'. If a '2' is on the left edge, it is replaced with a '1'.
        -  the sequence 5,2,2 becomes 2,2,2
        -  the sequence 5,2,1 becomes 1,1,1

    *   **Example 3:** 
        - If '7' is followed by '8', the '7' becomes '6'. 
        - If '8' is followed by '7', the '7' becomes '5'.
        - The sequence '7 8 7' becomes '6 8 5'.

4. The rules are not consistent across the examples. The replacements are highly context-dependent, and additional training data is required to establish a single, comprehensive rule.
