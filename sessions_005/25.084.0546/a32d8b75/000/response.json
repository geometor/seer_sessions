            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on elements, a YAML block of facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The input grids appear to contain several distinct regions of color, often rectangular, which are then rearranged or modified in the output.  Key colors observed are grey (5), green (3), blue(1), magenta(6), yellow (4), orange (7), azure(8), and red(2). The transformation does not seem to simply mirror or rotate, but reconfigures the colored regions in a more complex way. It seems that \"background\" (0/white) pixels are completely removed.\n\n**YAML Block of Facts:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Colored Regions:** Scan the input grid and identify all contiguous regions of non-zero colored pixels. Each of these regions is an object.\n\n2.  **Remove Background:** Delete all pixels with the color value 0 (white).\n\n3. **Stack Subgrids** Stack the subgrids on top of each other, maintaining relative x-coordinates. Each subgrid contains only those parts of the original color that contained the original subgrid.\n\n4. The order of stacking is given by the numerical value on that line.\n\nExample Walkthrough (train\\_1):\n\n*   The gray (5) region at the top right of the input becomes the leftmost column in the output.\n*   The green (3) regions, become the next columns in the output.\n*   Azure (8) pixels towards the right become the final subgrid\n*   Orange(7), yellow(4) and Blue(1) are other subgrids in the original image.\n* Magenta(6) blocks are removed.\n\nExample Walkthrough (train\\_2):\n\n*   The azure (8) region at the top right of the input becomes a significant portion of the output.\n*   The maroon (9) regions, are at the right of the subgrid.\n* The white and magenta regions are removed.\n* The objects in the left subgrid become a smaller subgrid, order is mantained.\n\nExample Walkthrough (train\\_3):\n\n*   The gray (5) region at the top of the input becomes the top part of the output.\n*   The green (3)/azure(8) section is in the top middle\n* The yellow section is in the middle.\n* The white section is removed, the magenta is removed.\n"
