The transformation removes all white (0) pixels from the input grid and stacks the remaining colored regions on top of each other, maintaining their original horizontal positions. The colored regions maintain relative x-coordinates, creating subgrids. The order of subgrids is given by the numerical value. Magenta sections are also completely removed.
