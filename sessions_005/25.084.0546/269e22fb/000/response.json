The output grids are consistently larger than the input grids.  The numbers/colors present in the input grid also appear in the output grid, but with additional instances and in different arrangements. There's a sense of expansion and possibly replication or mirroring, overlaid with some changes in specific pixel values. The specific transformation appears complex and isn't immediately obvious (like a simple scaling or color replacement). The core challenge is to determine the precise rule governing this expansion and color modification.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1. **Expansion:** The input grid is expanded to create a larger output grid.  The expansion is not uniform; The output dimensions are considerably larger than a simple doubling or tripling of the input dimensions. The output is roughly double the input in rows, and from 2x to 3x in cols, but this isn't a consistent scale factor.\n\n2. **Initial Fill:** The expanded grid is initially filled. It appears pixels from the input are tiled and repeated, *then* they are changed.\n\n3. **Pixel Modification (Complex Rule):** After the initial fill, specific pixels within the expanded grid have their values (colors) changed according to a rule that is *not* a simple color substitution. The rule likely depends on a combination of:\n    - The original pixel's value in the input grid.\n    - The pixel's position in the *output* grid.\n    - The pixel's *surrounding* pixel values in the output. It looks like some kind of \"smoothing\" or \"averaging\" is performed, but with conditions.\n    - Some form of reflection or symmetry may be involved.\n\n4. **Specific observations:** It looks like regions of the same number (color) in the input are expanded into larger regions of the same color in the output. Then, the *edges* of those regions are modified. The modifications depend on the neighboring colors.\n\n5. **Overall:** The transformation is best described as a \"structured expansion with edge-aware color modification.\" The core challenge will be defining the precise \"edge-aware\" rule. The expansion could be thought of as a complex form of interpolation where the original input pixels act as \"control points\".\n"
