Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of expanding the grid and propagating colors directionally (left-to-right, top-to-bottom) has some merit, but it's clearly insufficient to capture the full complexity of the transformation. The code fails to correctly reproduce the expected outputs in all five test cases, with a significant number of mismatched pixels. The "diagonal" filling and wrapping attempts are also not working as intended. The hardcoded output dimension adjustments are a sign of overfitting to specific examples and a lack of a generalizable rule for determining output size. The strategy needs to move away from simple propagation and consider a more sophisticated pattern-matching or object-based approach, as suggested by the ARC priors.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Abandon Simple Propagation:** The current propagation logic is fundamentally flawed. It doesn't account for the complex shapes and arrangements observed in the outputs.

2.  **Object Identification:**  The core issue is that we are not identifying "objects" correctly. We need to treat contiguous regions of the *same* color as single objects. This includes diagonally connected regions.

3.  **Object Transformation:** Once we have objects, the transformation rule appears to involve *replicating* these objects and arranging the copies in a specific pattern within a larger output grid. The exact replication and placement rule is what we need to derive. It is likely some form of 2x2 tiling.

4. **Dynamic output sizing**: Instead of hardcoding it, output size is related to input size.

5.  **Iterative Refinement:**  Test the revised logic after each change against *all* examples.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Object Definition:** Identify objects within the input grid. An object is defined as a contiguous region of pixels sharing the same color. Contiguous includes diagonally adjacent pixels.

2.  **Object Replication:** The transformation involves replicating the identified input objects. It's a form of tiling, where the input image appears to be replicated.

3. **Tiling and Positioning:** The output grid is constructed by arranging these replicated objects, and it follows a consistent but complex tiling pattern. The arrangement is not a simple doubling or mirroring. It's more akin to a 2x2 grid replication, but with overlaps and specific placement rules that need to be determined.

4.  **Output Size:** The output grid dimensions are related to the input grid dimensions.  The output width is approximately double the input width. The output height is approximately double the input, but can sometimes be larger.

5. **Color Preservation:** The transformation preserves the colors of the input objects. The output grid contains only colors present in the input grid.
