            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy to refine the natural language program and the code:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code attempted a two-step process: expansion and neighbor-based modification.  The results show a consistent failure: the output dimensions are incorrect, and the color modification logic doesn't capture the actual transformation.  The \"Match: False\" and \"Size Correct: False\" indicate a fundamental problem with both the resizing and the color-change rules. The color palette is correct, suggesting the issue isn't with choosing invalid colors, but rather *when* and *where* to apply them.\n\nThe previous strategy relied too heavily on random variation in output size and a simplistic neighbor-averaging rule. The actual transformation seems deterministic and related to a fixed, patterned expansion, possibly with some \"smoothing\" or \"anti-aliasing\" along edges. It is like a specialized \"image scaling\" process.\n\nMy strategy is now:\n\n1. **Focus on Size Determination:** Discard the randomized output size. Analyze the input and output sizes for *each* example carefully. Look for a consistent mathematical relationship (multiplication, addition, or a combination) between input and output dimensions.  Use code execution to calculate ratios and differences to discover patterns.\n2. **Re-examine the Color Rule:** The neighbor-averaging rule isn't working. Discard the \"most frequent neighbor\" approach. Instead, focus on how the colors change *relative to their original position* in the input grid.  Look for patterns of color propagation and blending along edges.  Think in terms of how the colors \"bleed\" or \"interpolate\" into the newly created space during expansion. Think about specific cell transitions (e.g. 7 to 8, 8 to 7)\n3. **Iterative Refinement:** Develop a new hypothesis about size and color rules. Implement the revised logic. Test against *all* provided examples. Repeat this process until all examples match perfectly.\n4. **Prior Knowledge:** Use the core priors as guidance. Objectness is important, suggesting that areas of solid colors are meant to expand and change in ways that preserve some aspect of the original structure.\n\n**Gather Metrics (Code Execution)**\n\n"
