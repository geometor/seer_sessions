The primary issues appear to be:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Top Row Removal and Replacement:** The code intends to remove the top five rows, but it doesn't correctly replace any elements of those rows.\n2.  **Misunderstanding of Azure Movement:** The code attempts to move azure objects to the top, and while the logic has been added it is not in the correct order and the code is incomplete. The logic about expanding azure down will not be correct after elements are moved.\n3.  **Incorrect dimensions of output**: The output shape should be (rows - 5,\n    cols), there is no attempt to reduce the number of rows.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Iterative Refinement:** Address the errors one by one, testing the code after each significant change. Start with fixing output dimensions.\n2.  **Prioritize Row Removal:** Ensure the top five rows are correctly handled before moving on to object manipulation.\n3. **Simplify Azure Logic**: Focus on moving the azure blocks to top section of the grid after other rows operations and simplify by removing any logic which is not related to the movement of azure blocks.\n4.  **Comprehensive Testing:** After each code modification, test against *all* training examples to prevent regressions.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis:**\n\nI will use `numpy` to perform a pixel-by-pixel comparison, checking:\n\n*   **Dimensions:** Verify output grid dimensions.\n*   **Pixel Matches:** Count matching pixels.\n*   **Color Palettes:** Compare the set of colors used in the output and expected output.\n\nIt is not necessary to use code execution at this phase since the error in\ndimensions is readily apparent.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n"
