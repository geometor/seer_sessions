The subsequent tests reveal significant discrepancies between the expected and transformed outputs. The primary issue is the incorrect handling of the azure (8) pixels. The code attempts to move all azure pixels to the top, but it doesn't maintain the relative vertical order *within* each column, and doesn't correctly place the azure blocks relative to other non-azure pixels in the input that were above the cut line. It also fails to account for cases where there may be more than 5 azure blocks in any given column. The top five rows are removed, and azure pixels are moved to the top section of the remaining grid, but the code fills the rest with white.\n\nThe strategy will be to:\n\n1.  **Gather Metrics:** Analyze each example pair to precisely quantify the differences. Specifically, look at color counts and spatial arrangements of azure pixels before and after transformation, and how non-azure pixels are moved.\n2.  **Refine Observations:** Update the YAML fact documentation with these quantified observations.\n3.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the program to accurately reflect a rule that accounts for moving *only* azure blocks that are in the top 5 rows, to a position relative to the top of the output grid, and preserving the position and count of azure blocks in each column.\n4. Re-code: regenerate the function\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nTo thoroughly analyze the examples, let's use a Python tool to compute detailed differences:\n"
