There are distinct regions of different colors in both input and output. Some regions appear to be moving or changing, while others are removed entirely. The most prominent changes seem to involve the azure (8) colored pixels, which expand significantly, and some colors in the top section of the input which are completely removed in the output. The background (5 - gray) is removed completely as well. Some colored regions in the lower area of the image are maintained.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Expand these regions downwards and slightly upwards, overwriting the colors in the top section and potentially merging existing azure regions. The downwards expansion should fill the regions formerly occupied by the green, red, yellow, and magenta blocks while maintaining their column positions.\n4.  **Preserve Lower Colors:** Keep the remaining areas of red, green, yellow, magenta, and blue from input in the output without changing.\n"
