Okay, let's analyze these input-output pairs to discern the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements of the Task:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits, representing colors.
*   The input grids appear to have multiple distinct horizontal bands of solid colors, and some internal structures involving change of color, especially within the central area.
*   The output grids are consistently smaller than the input grids, and often contain only a few colors (mostly 3 (green) and 4(yellow), some 1(blue) and also 8(light blue) from the middle).
*   There seems to be a process of extracting and simplifying specific regions or patterns from the input, focusing on the inner areas.
*   There are multiple different background colors in the input.
*   The output grids seem to keep some color in the same relative postion.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**


```yaml
observations:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are grids of varying dimensions.
  - type: color_bands
    description: Input grids have horizontal bands of uniform color.
  - type: inner_structure
    description: Input grids have complex color arrangements within the central bands.
  - type: simplification
    description: Output grids appear to be simplified extractions of the input.
  - type: size_reduction
    description: Output grids are smaller than input grids.
  - type: object_extraction
    description: specific color patterns inner part are focused.
  - type: color
    values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    description: numerical values are index of colors.
  - type: background
    description: different background color each input.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the central region:** Determine a central region within the input grid. This region appears to be defined by consistent internal color, and it can vary.
2.  **Crop the Grid:** Find the top most and bottom most rows where we can find colors other than the top and bottom most color. The slice the image vertically to remove left and right columns where the pixel value equal the first and last value.
3. **Remove outside band** Remove the one unit band of uniform color at the boarder.
4.  **Return Center:** Extract the inner core and return it as the output grid.
