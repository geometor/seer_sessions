objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      properties:
        - height: variable
        - width: variable
  - subgrid:
      type: repeating pattern within the grid.
      properties:
         - colors: a set of color values
         - shape: rectangle, defined by height and width
         - size:
            train_1: 6x6 (height x width)
            train_2: 7x7

actions:
  - cropping:
      description: Removing rows and columns from the outer edges of the grid.
      parameters:
        - rows_removed_top: constant, based on pattern
        - rows_removed_bottom: constant, based on pattern
        - columns_removed_left: constant, based on pattern
        - columns_removed_right: constant, based on pattern

relationships:
  - input_grid_contains_output_grid: The output grid is a sub-region of the input grid.
  - subgrid_tiling:  The input grid can be viewed as a tiling of the subgrid pattern, accounting for boundary conditions and partial subgrids.
