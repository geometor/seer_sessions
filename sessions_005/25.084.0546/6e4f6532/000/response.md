Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

*   The input and output grids are the same size.
*   There are multiple colors (represented by digits) present.
*   Some regions of color remain unchanged, while others are modified. The unchanged parts seem to outline the structure, acting like a frame, while the changes occur within enclosed areas.
* Changes are not uniform.
* There appears to be a focus on certain rectangular subregions of specific colors. These seem to be selectively modified and it looks almost "random" filling of blocks with different colors inside the subregions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [rows, cols] # Same for input and output
      cells:
        values: [0-9] # Representing colors
  - type: region
    properties:
        color: integer
        shape: rectangle
        location: [row_start, col_start, row_end, col_end]
    actions:
      - modify:
          description: "Pixels within the region are changed, seemingly randomly, but following the same pattern for both examples within some regions."

relationships:
  - type: containment
    description: "The grid contains multiple regions."
  - type: frame
    description: "some regions with no change defines the frame for modification"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Frame:** The input grid contains unchanged regions of colors at the outer edges and in consistent straight lines. The input and output has some objects that are the same.
2.  **Identify Regions:** Within the input grid, locate rectangular regions of uniform color that aren't part of the unchanged frame.
3.  **Modify Regions:** Within each identified region apply the same changes across the examples:
    *   Example 1:
        * The gray (5) region is modified to generate an almost random-looking pattern.
        * Yellow (4), blue(1), orange(7), magenta(6) regions on the boundary are kept as they are.
    * Example 2:
        *   The white (1) region bounded by grey(4), red(2), orange(7), green (3) regions is modified, replacing its contents with a seemingly random pattern of colors.
        *   The border regions stay the same.

In summary, the transformation identifies bounded regions of colors and modifies the inside of each area following the same pattern on all the examples, while maintaining any unchanged region between input and output.
