Copy all non-zero pixels to the output grid in the same positions, with some exceptions described below.\n2.  **Fill:**\n    *   Identify all pixels with value `0` in the original input.\n    *    For any `0` pixel, check the value of the pixel in that position in the output.\n    *   If the pixel in the output is already non-zero do nothing.\n        *   If the output pixel is zero, find the nearest non-zero pixel directly above, below, and to each side.\n        *   If any two or more of these pixels have equal value, then set this output pixel to the same value.\n\nThe key idea is a combination of copying non-zero pixels, and propagating non-zero values into areas that were initially zero, based on a \"nearest non-zero neighbor in four directions\" rule.\n"
