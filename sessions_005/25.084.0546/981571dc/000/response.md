Okay, let's analyze these input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output grids are of the same dimensions.
*   The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   There are contiguous blocks of the same color, suggesting objects.
*   The transformation seems to involve some form of object interaction or modification, rather than a simple pixel-by-pixel mapping.
*   It appears some shapes and colors repeat, and some are altered.
*    There is a mixture of both copying from the input and producing new output.
*    There is complete coverage - the algorithm fills the entire output

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - observation: Grid cells contain integers 0-9, representing colors.
  - observation: Contiguous blocks of the same color form objects.
  - property:    Objects can be characterized by their color, shape, and position.
  - action:      Some objects are copied from input to output.
  - action:     Some objects have color changes
  - action: Some objects are deleted.
  - action: Some objects are created.
  - relationship: The background color (white, 0) frequently changes to other colors, filling in areas within a repeating shape.
  - relationship: It looks like the transformation fills pixels that were 0, and also overwrites some of the previous, non-zero, colors.
  - observation: It almost appears to be a repetition of the inside of shapes formed by non-zero pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy:** Iterate through the input grid. Copy all non-zero pixels to the output grid in the same positions, with some exceptions described below.
2.  **Fill:**
    *   Identify all pixels with value `0` in the original input.
    *    For any `0` pixel, check the value of the pixel in that position in the output.
    *   If the pixel in the output is already non-zero do nothing.
        *   If the output pixel is zero, find the nearest non-zero pixel directly above, below, and to each side.
        *   If any two or more of these pixels have equal value, then set this output pixel to the same value.

The key idea is a combination of copying non-zero pixels, and propagating non-zero values into areas that were initially zero, based on a "nearest non-zero neighbor in four directions" rule.
