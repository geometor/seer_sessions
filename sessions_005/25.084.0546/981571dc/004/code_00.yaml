facts:
  - observation: "Zero-valued pixels are candidates for modification."
  - observation: "Non-zero pixels in the input remain unchanged in the output."
  - observation: "The value of a modified zero-valued pixel is determined by its immediate neighbors."
  - observation: "Immediate neighbors are defined as those directly above, below, left, or right (cardinal directions)."
  - observation: "If at least two neighbors have the same non-zero value, the zero-valued pixel is set to that value."
  - observation: "If no two neighbors share a non-zero value the zero valued pixel is not changed"
  - hypothesis: "The transformation seems to be a form of nearest-neighbor interpolation or a 'filling' operation."
  - hypothesis: "The algorithm is probably not considering diagonal neighbors"
  - concern: "The current implementation is inefficient, resulting in timeouts, may result in infinite loop"
