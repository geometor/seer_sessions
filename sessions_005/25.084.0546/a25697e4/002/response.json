            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for refining the natural language program and the code:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were based on a reasonable interpretation of the first example. However, the subsequent test results reveal significant discrepancies. The core issue is that the mirroring logic is not consistently applied across all examples, and the conditions for mirroring (presence of a red block, object center, etc.) are not correctly capturing the underlying rule.\n\nThe strategy will be:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Failed Examples:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output of examples 1, 2 and 3. Identify specific pixels that differ and try to reason about *why* the current logic failed to produce the correct result.\n\n2.  **Refine the \"Mirroring\" Concept:** The current code uses a combination of red block detection and object-center mirroring. This seems too complex. The examples suggest a simpler rule might be at play, potentially related to the position of the objects relative to each other or absolute position. We need to determine clear criteria.\n\n3. **Object Interaction:** Notice how, in the presence of multiple objects/colors, an entire object is transformed. We should verify the current object finding method (`find_objects`) and improve if neeed.\n\n4.  **YAML Documentation:** Create a YAML structure that meticulously records the observations from each example. This will help in pattern detection. This will be helpful for the coding phase.\n\n5.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** Based on the updated understanding, rewrite the natural language program to describe the transformation rule clearly and concisely.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (using code execution, if necessary - in this stage conceptual)**\n\nWe need to collect the following information:\n\n*   **For each example:**\n    *   Number of objects of each color in the input.\n    *   Number of objects of each color in the expected output.\n    *   Presence, location, and size of any \"special\" objects (like the red blocks in the initial examples).  However, we should avoid assuming red is *always* special.\n    *   Relative positions of objects (above, below, adjacent).\n    * Differences between expected vs actual.\n\n**YAML Documentation (Example - will be expanded)**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program (Revised)**\n\nThe transformation rule involves identifying non-blue objects within the input grid. The objects are vertically mirrored. If a 2x2 red block is present, objects below it are mirrored to positions directly above it, preserving relative positioning and overwriting cells if objects overlap. If no red block is present all of the objects are mirrored. When multiple objects are mirrored their relative vertical order and shape is preserved.\n\nThis is still a work in progress, but it reflects the adjustments made after the review.  The next iteration should move into code and work to develop a matching program.\n"
