example_1:
  input:
    objects:
      - color: 3  # Green
        coordinates: [(1,19),(2,19),(3,18),(3,19),(4,18),(4,19)]
      - color: 4 # Yellow
        coordinates: [(5,18),(6,18),(7,18),(8,18),(9,20)]
      - color: 2  # Red
        coordinates: [(6,0),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,0),(7,1),(9,0),(9,1),(9,2),(9,3)]

  output:
    objects:
      - color: 3
        coordinates: [(8,18),(9,18),(10,18),(10,19),(11,19)]
  observations:
    - "Green and yellow objects below the red block, are mirrored above the red block."
    - "The relative positions of green and yellow are maintained"
    - "some cells of yellow and green blocks are overwritten because of object size differnces"

example_2:
  input:
    objects:
      - color: 3
        coordinates: [(1,19),(2,19),(3,18),(3,19),(4,18),(4,19)]
        
      - color: 4
        coordinates: [(5,18),(6,18),(7,18),(8,18),(9,20)]
      - color: 2
        coordinates: [(6,0),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(8,0),(8,1),(9,0),(9,1),(9,2),(9,3)]
  output:
    objects:
          - color: 2  # Red
            coordinates: [(6,0),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(8,0),(8,1),(9,0),(9,1),(9,2),(9,3)]
          - color: 3
            coordinates: [(7,6)(7,7),(8,6),(8,7)]
          - color: 4
            coordinates: [(6,6),(6,7),(6,8),(6,9),(8,8),(8,9),(8,10)]

  observations:
     - "Green and yellow objects below the red block, are mirrored above the red block."
     - "The shape of the objects are important."
     - "The yellow object appears to be split around the red object"
     - "some cells of the red block are overwritten"
example_3:
    input:
      objects:
        - color: 5
          coordinates: [(11,4), (12,3),(12,4),(13,3),(13,4),(13,5)]
        - color: 7
          coordinates: [(14,6),(14,7),(14,8),(15,6),(16,6),(16,7)]
        - color: 6
          coordinates: [(15,11),(15,13),(15,14),(15,15), (16,11),(16,13),(16,14),(16,15), (17,11),(17,13),(17,14),(17,15)]
    output:
      objects:
          - color: 5
            coordinates: [(17,3),(17,4),(17,5), (16,3),(16,4),(15,4)]
          - color: 6
            coordinates: [(17,11),(17,13),(17,14),(17,15),(16,11),(16,13),(16,14),(16,15), (15,11)]
          - color: 7
            coordinates: [(16,13),(16,14),(16,15), (15,13),(14,13),(14,14)]

    observations:
        - no red block
        - the shape of the objects are mirrored vertically across a horizontal line
        - the position of the colors are also mirrored vertically
        - The 6 object looks like it gets overlaid on the 7 object, 7 is to the left of 6.
