Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The transformation seems to involve a combination of object identification, color changes, and potentially some spatial reasoning or mirroring. There are distinct regions of color changes, often appearing as rectangular blocks or single lines. The unchanged parts of the input grids are always filled with the digit 1 (blue).

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids are of the same dimensions."
  - observation: "Most of the grid is filled with the color blue (1)."
  - object: "Colored regions"
    properties:
      - type: "Rectangular blocks or lines"
      - colors: "[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]"
    actions:
      - "Appear, disappear, or change color"
    relationships:
      - "Adjacent to blue (1) regions"
  - observation: "in example 1 and 2, the bottom right green and yellow blocks appear to become mirrored across the red block and each other."
  - observation: "in example 3, the magenta, orange, and gray are mirrored, while preserving adjaceny and order"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colored Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions (blocks or lines) of pixels that are *not* blue (1).
2.  **Mirror Colored Regions:** Take any colored object below the lowest 2x2 red block and move the to be directly above that same red 2x2 block.
3. **Preserve Order:** If multiple colored object are adjacent to each other (example 3) they should not change position, but mirror to become adjacent to the same object above the lowest 2x2 red block.
