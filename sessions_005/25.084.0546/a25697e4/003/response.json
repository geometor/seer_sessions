If a 2x2 red block is present, objects below it are mirrored to positions directly above it, preserving relative positioning and overwriting cells if objects overlap. If no red block is present all of the objects are mirrored. When multiple objects are mirrored their relative vertical order and shape is preserved.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds contiguous objects in the grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n\n    def dfs(row, col, color, current_object):\n        if (row < 0 or row >= grid.shape[0] or col < 0 or col >= grid.shape[1] or\n                visited[row, col] or grid[row, col] != color):\n            return\n        visited[row, col] = True\n        current_object.append((row, col))\n        dfs(row + 1, col, color, current_object)\n        dfs(row - 1, col, color, current_object)\n        dfs(row, col + 1, color, current_object)\n        dfs(row, col - 1, color, current_object)\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if not visited[row, col] and grid[row, col] != 1:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(row, col, grid[row, col], current_object)\n                objects.append((grid[row, col], current_object))  # Store color and object\n    return objects\n\ndef find_lowest_red_block(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds the lowest 2x2 red block's top-left coordinates.\"\"\"\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0] - 1, -1, -1):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1] - 1):\n            if (grid[r, c] == 2 and grid[r + 1, c] == 2 and\n                grid[r, c + 1] == 2 and grid[r + 1, c + 1] == 2):\n                return r, c\n    return None\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the mirroring rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    output_grid[:] = 1  # Initialize with blue (1)\n\n    objects = find_objects(input_grid)\n    red_block_coords = find_lowest_red_block(input_grid)\n\n    if red_block_coords is not None:\n        red_row, red_col = red_block_coords\n        # Sort objects by their minimum row, so lower objects get priority in the output.\n        objects.sort(key=lambda x: min(r for r, _ in x[1]))\n\n        for color, obj in objects:\n            min_row = min(r for r, _ in obj)\n            max_row = max(r for r, _ in obj)\n            \n            if max_row >= red_row:\n                # Mirror objects that are at or below the red block\n                for r, c in obj:\n                    dist_to_red = r - red_row\n                    new_row = red_row - dist_to_red -1 #shift objects above block\n\n                    if new_row >= 0:\n                         output_grid[new_row, c] = color  # Mirrored position\n                    \n            else:\n                #copy all objects that are above the red block - no mirroring\n                for r,c in obj:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = color\n\n    else:\n        # No red block: Mirror all objects relative to grid's vertical center.\n\n        #find the center of all objects to mirror around\n        object_rows = []\n        for color, obj in objects:\n            for r, _ in obj:\n                object_rows.append(r)\n\n        if len(object_rows) > 0:\n           min_row = min(object_rows)\n           max_row = max(object_rows)\n\n           center_row = (min_row + max_row) / 2\n\n        else:\n            return input_grid.tolist()\n\n        # Sort objects by lowest y coordinate.\n        objects_sorted = sorted(objects, key=lambda item: min(row for row, _ in item[1]))\n        \n        for color, obj in objects_sorted:\n            for r, c in obj:\n                \n                dist_to_center = r - center_row\n                new_row = int(round(center_row - dist_to_center))\n                if 0 <= new_row < output_grid.shape[0]:\n                     output_grid[new_row, c] = color\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
