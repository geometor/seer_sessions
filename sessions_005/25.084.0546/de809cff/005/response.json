Pixels are considered connected if they are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n2.  **Identify Boundary Pixels:** A boundary pixel is a pixel that belongs to a region and is directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a pixel of a *different* color.\n3. **Determine Colors at Boundary**: For each pair of different colored adjacent pixels at the shared boundary, determine the lower and higher values\n4.  **Apply Color Change:** At the boundary, if the two adjacent pixels have different color values, change the pixel with the *lower* color value to azure (8).\n5.
