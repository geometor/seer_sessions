example_1:
  input:
    objects:
      - color: 3  # Green
        shape: irregular
        contiguous: true
      - color: 4  # Yellow
        shape: irregular
        contiguous: true
      - color: 0  # white
        shape: background
        contiguous: false
    actions:
      - type: color_change
        target: boundary pixels between 3 and 4, and lower color
        new_color: 8 # Azure
        condition: lower of adjacent pixels, at the shared boundary

  expected_output:
      - color: 8
        shape: lines at boundary
        contiguous: False

example_2:
  input:
    objects:
      - color: 1  # Blue
        shape: irregular
        contiguous: true
      - color: 2  # Red
        shape: irregular
        contiguous: true
      - color: 0
        shape: background
        contiguous: false
  actions:
      - type: color_change
        target: boundary pixels between 1 and 2
        new_color: 8
        condition: lower of adjacent pixels, at the shared boundary
  expected_output:
      - color: 8
        shape: lines at boundary
        contiguous: False

general_rule:
    - objects are defined by contiguous regions of same color.
    - boundaries are where different colored regions meet.
    - At a color boundary, the color of the lower value pixel is changed to 8.
    - white(0) is not affected.
