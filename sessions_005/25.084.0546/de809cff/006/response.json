            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach focused on identifying boundary pixels between different colors and changing the lower color to azure (8).  However, the results show significant discrepancies between the transformed output and the expected output in both examples. The primary issue appears to be the *incorrect identification of which pixel to modify* at the boundary, and missing some cases. In some instances, it's not the lower color, and sometimes specific shapes/regions are targeted for the color change based on their relationship with other colors and potentially some shape properties. Also, the current approach is changing too many or to few pixels.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output of both examples to pinpoint *exactly* where the errors occur. We'll need to look for patterns in *which* pixels were changed incorrectly and *which* were missed.\n2.  **Refine Boundary Definition:** The current definition of a \"boundary\" might be too broad or too narrow. We need to consider if only certain *types* of boundaries are relevant.\n3.  **Consider Relative Position/Shape:** The transformation may depend not just on color difference, but also the relative position or shape of the colored regions.\n4. **Consider white spaces**: The prompt says not to change the color of any white spaces (0) but doesn't explicitly say what _to do_ with white spaces.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis**\n\nLet's use a slightly modified version of the original program to get more detailed metrics about how many changes and incorrect changes are being made on the boundary.\n\n"

Pixels are considered connected if they are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n2.  **Identify Boundary Pixels:** A boundary pixel is a pixel that belongs to a region and is directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a pixel of a *different* color. White pixels act act as boundary _except_ when the white pixels make a straight line between regions.\n3. **Line Completion Rule**: Examine the boundaries between colored regions (excluding white, except where a white line separates). If a pixel at the boundary, when changed to azure (8), would *complete a continuous, straight line of azure* of length greater than one, then make the transformation based on these additional constraints:\n   * If the changed pixel has only one adjacent non-white neighbor in the target region, it changes to azure (8).\n   * If the changed pixel has 3 or more adjacent non-white neighbors in the adjacent region, _and_ is part of the other color region, it changes to azure (8).\n\n4. Never change the color of a white (0) pixel.\n"
