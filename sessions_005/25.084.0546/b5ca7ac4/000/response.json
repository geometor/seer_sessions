There are several distinct regions of different colors in both the input and output. It appears that the transformation involves some form of mirroring or reflection, combined with selective color changes. Certain colored regions maintain relative positional relationships while others don't. The white background(0) seems to serve as a boundary or is ignored in the transformation. The overall dimensions of the grid remain constant. There seem to be different 'objects', bounded by white(0) or the edge of the grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n"
