1.  **Object Identification:** Identify distinct objects (contiguous same-color pixels, excluding white).
2.  **Object Categorization:** Categorize objects based on their initial position (top_left, top_right, middle_left, other).
3.  **Object Transformation (Movement):** Move objects based on their category:
    *   `top_left` objects move down to the middle_left area.
    *   `top_right` objects move down to the middle_right area.
    *   `middle_left` objects move to the bottom_middle area.
    *   `other` objects remain in their original positions.
4.  **Grid Reconstruction:** Create a new grid and place transformed objects, filling the rest with white (0).
