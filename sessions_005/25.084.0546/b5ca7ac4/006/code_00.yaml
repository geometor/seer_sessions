task: arc_08ed6ac7
description: |-
  Objects move vertically, wrapping around the grid edges.  The distance and direction
  of movement appear to be specific to each individual object, not just its color.
  Objects of the same color can move differently.

observations:
  - example_1:
      input_objects: 16
      output_objects: 15
      object_counts_by_color:
        input:  {0: 1, 8: 3, 5: 1, 2: 4, 1: 1, 3: 2, 9: 1, 6: 1, 4: 2}
        output: {0: 3, 8: 2, 5: 1, 2: 2, 1: 1, 3: 2, 9: 1, 6: 1, 4: 2} #Note, output grid background object is sometimes split
      notes: "Multiple objects of the same color move different amounts."
  - example_2:
      input_objects: 17
      output_objects: 16
      object_counts_by_color:
        input:  {4: 1, 2: 4, 5: 1, 8: 4, 9: 1, 3: 2, 6: 2, 1: 2}
        output: {4: 2, 2: 3, 5: 1, 8: 3, 9: 1, 3: 2, 6: 2, 1: 2} # same comment regarding 0
      notes: "Again, objects of the same color move by different amounts and sometimes merge"
