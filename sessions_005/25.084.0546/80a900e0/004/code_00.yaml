  - name: propagate_color
    description: Copy the color of a source pixel to target pixels following the checkerboard.
    constraints:
      - "Target pixels must have the same checkerboard position (even/odd row and column) as the source pixel."
      - "Only propagate colors from source cells that have initial colors and are white (0)."
