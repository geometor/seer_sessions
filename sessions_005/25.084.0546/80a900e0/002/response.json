            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on observing a diagonal propagation of non-blue (1) and non-white (0) colors within a checkerboard pattern of 1s and 0s. However, the tests reveal a critical flaw: the propagation direction and pattern are incorrect. The code propagates colors *upwards and to the left*, while the correct transformation appears to propagate colors *downwards and to the right, but only along the diagonals of the checkerboard*. Additionally, example 2 suggests there may also be a pattern of skipping cells between copies.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Checkerboard Pattern:** Confirm the checkerboard pattern (alternating 1s and 0s) is consistent across all examples.\n2.  **Correct Propagation Direction:** Modify the code to propagate downwards and to the right.\n3.  **Confirm Propagation pattern**: Examine the examples closely to see where the copied color values are placed\n4.  **Refine Logic:** After analyzing the results, update the natural language program and the Python code accordingly.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example-Specific):**\n\nWe need to manually inspect this, as the code is not yet able to produce good analyses.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n\n    *   Input has a clear 1/0 checkerboard background.\n    *   Colors 8 (azure) and 3 (green) are present.\n    *   The azure and green colors appear copied downwards and to the right, along the checkerboard's main diagonals.\n    *   The expected output shows these colors propagated along diagonals where 1,0 pattern match\n*    **Example 2:**\n    * Input has a clear 1/0 checkerboard pattern\n    * Colors 2(red), 3(green) and 4(yellow) are present\n    * The expected output shows the input colors 2, 3, and 4 propagated downwards and to the right, but only to cells *two* spaces away.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
