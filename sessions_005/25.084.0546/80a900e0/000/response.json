The grids consist primarily of alternating 1s (blue) and 0s (white) in a checkerboard pattern. There are other colors present, seemingly replacing some of the 0s. The goal is to insert copies of non-blue and non-white colors on the top of other existing colors according to some pattern logic.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
