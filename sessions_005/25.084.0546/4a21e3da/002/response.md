Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The code's initial strategy of mirroring orange regions and filling based on blue pixels is partially correct but misses crucial aspects of the transformation. The code fails to accurately reproduce the expected output in all three test cases, indicating errors in how it handles the mirroring, filling, and potentially the interaction between different colored regions. The "Pixels Off" metric, consistently high, suggests a systematic flaw rather than minor inaccuracies. The assumption that disconnected orange should become blue is not always correct.

The primary issues seem to be:

1.  **Incorrect Mirroring/Filling Logic:** The mirroring logic isn't a simple horizontal flip. It's more about filling areas to create symmetrical shapes, often around a central red pixel or region, but not always. The way the code currently handles blue pixels is also not consistent with the expected outputs.
2. **Ignoring Context** The current logic seems to consider disconnected orange regions should be blue, but that is only sometimes true.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-evaluate Mirroring:** Instead of directly mirroring coordinates, we need to analyze the spatial relationships between orange, blue, and red pixels to determine the intended symmetry and filling.
2.  **Refine Filling Rules:** Determine the precise conditions under which blue pixels become orange and vice versa. It's not a simple replacement; it's likely based on proximity to other colors and the overall shape being formed.
3. **Consider relative positions:** Consider if the orange regions should be relative to a red center.

**Gather Metrics:**

Let's compute additional metrics to clarify the transformation:
