The primary colors involved are blue (1), red (2), and orange (7).  The transformation seems to involve a complex interplay between orange (7) and blue (1) regions, with red (2) appearing to act as a sort of fixed point or delimiter. The positioning and shape of the orange regions in the input appear to heavily influence the output, with a filling or \"bleeding\" effect sometimes occurring. The output maintains the same dimensions of input.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts**\n\n"

If it collides with other orange regions, keep the original orange regions\n\n4.  **Red (2) Pixel Preservation:**  All red (2) pixels in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\n5. **Preserve some Orange regions**: In some cases, portions of the original orange areas may persist into the transformed output, especially around red pixels. It appears these represent places where expanding the mirrored orange area is blocked\n\n6.  **Orange expansion rules:** It appears that isolated orange areas are mirrored, while connected groups of orange pixels are mirrored on both sides. When mirroring the \"pixels\" of value 1, become 7s. The mirroring is symmetrical.\n\n7. **Final check for disconnected oranges:** Check if there are 7s that appear alone, replace them with 1's.\n"
