            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the natural language program and the subsequent code.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe code performs a reasonable initial attempt at the transformation, identifying blue objects and attempting to create outlines and inner fills. However, the matching results are poor, with many pixels differing between the transformed output and expected output across all three examples. The strategy to resolve is:\n\n1.  **Detailed Error Analysis**: We need to pinpoint precisely *where* the code's logic deviates from the expected output. This will be done through pixel-by-pixel comparison and by visualizing the intermediate steps (like the labeled regions) within the provided `transform` function.\n2.  **Refine Object Definition**: The definition of the objects could be leading to edge cases not being covered properly.\n3.  **Border and Fill Logic Adjustment**: The conditions for applying red outlines, light blue inner borders, and gray fills are not completely accurate, and need adjustments based on a careful review of the failing examples. The concept of adjacent pixels (including diagonals) may be essential.\n4. **Multiple Object Handling**: Although working for multiple objects, we need to ensure that objects of the same color are not merged improperly.\n\n**Gather Metrics**\n\nI'll use manual analysis of the provided information rather than `tool_code` as I don't have the ability to execute it in this environment, but I'll show the process I would take if the code was runnable.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n*   **Pixels Off:** 89\n*   **Size Correct:** True\n*   **Color Palette Correct:** False\n*   **Color Count Correct:** False\n*   **Observations**:\n    *   The top-left blue object is outlined correctly where adjacent to yellow or the grid edge.\n    *   The top-left blue object's inner border is mostly correct.\n    *   The gray fill in the center is mostly incorrect - not all pixels within the former blue object changed.\n    *   The lower-right blue object is not detected correctly - it appears that only pixels adjacent to '4' yellow pixels are detected.\n    *   The code is failing to convert some interior pixels of the first blue object to grey, and failing to perform the operations for the isolated lower-right blue area.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n*    **Pixels Off:** 209\n*   **Size Correct**: True\n*   **Color Palette Correct**: False\n*    **Observations:**\n    *   Very poor match\n    *   The red outline is incorrect in many places, appearing inside the original shape\n    *   The inner border and fill have many errors\n    *   There is some extra red on some of the top row not related to any blue object.\n\n**Example 3 Analysis:**\n*   **Pixels Off**: 29\n*   **Size Correct**: True\n*   **Color Palette Correct**: False\n\n*    **Observations:**\n    *    Better match than example 2, worse than example 1.\n    *    The top left shape is not rendered correctly.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts**\n\n"

Consider pixels adjacent if they share an edge *or a corner* (8-way connectivity, not just 4-way).\n\n2.  **Create Red Outer Border:** For each blue object, examine the pixels immediately surrounding it (8-way connectivity). If a surrounding pixel is yellow (4), *or* if the surrounding pixel is outside the bounds of the input grid, change that surrounding pixel to red (2).\n\n3.  **Create Light Blue Inner Border:** For each blue object, identify its inner border. A pixel is part of the inner border if it is blue (1) and is 8-way adjacent to any pixel that is *not* blue (1). Change these inner border pixels to light blue (8).\n\n4.  **Fill Interior with Gray:**  After creating the borders, change all remaining blue (1) pixels within each original blue object to gray (5).\n\n5. **Preserve All Other Colors**: Ensure all other original pixels in the input remain at their input color.\n"
