The input grids predominantly feature the color yellow (4) and blue (1). The output grids introduce additional colors: red (2), grey (6), and light blue (8). There's a clear alteration of existing blue (1) areas and introduction of new colored regions seemingly based on the configuration of blue pixels in the input. The surrounding yellow (4) pixels remain largely unchanged, acting as a background or frame, though some are replaced.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Replace the immediate outer border of yellow (4) by red (2). If a part of the blue region touches the border of the image, create a red (2) border at that location.\n\n3.  **Replace Blue with light blue:**  Inside the original border of the blue region, replace the immediate outer layer of blue (1) by light blue (8)\n\n4. **Replace central blue with gray:** In the area originally enclosed by blue, replace the remaing blue (1) with gray (6). If no blue reamins, no changes.\n\n5. **Background Preservation:**  Yellow (4) pixels not directly adjacent to identified blue regions remain unchanged, with some exception at the border of the grid to ensure continuous red lines.\n"
