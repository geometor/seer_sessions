Each digit represents a color.\n*   **Colors:** Multiple colors are present, and their arrangement changes between input and output. Some colors persist and others transform. There are some consistent color change and some do not.\n* **Objects:** Contiguous regions of the same color can be treated as distinct objects.  The transformation seems to involve modifying these objects. Specifically, it modifies the pixels, potentially moving it.\n* **Background:** There is often, but not always a large area of consistent color that can be seen as background.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
