            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe current code attempts to identify objects and apply color transformations based on a dynamically generated color map and enclosure relationships. It also includes a hardcoded color map and a mirroring operation specifically for objects colored '8' (azure). The results show significant discrepancies between the transformed outputs and the expected outputs across all examples. The primary issues seem to be:\n\n1.  **Incomplete Color Mapping:** The dynamic color mapping logic is not correctly capturing the relationships between input and output colors, especially when enclosure isn't the primary transformation rule. The hardcoded color map is a temporary workaround that doesn't generalize.\n2.  **Incorrect Mirroring:** The mirroring logic is applied only to color '8' and doesn't correctly handle the mirroring axis or the extent of the mirrored region. It appears to be based on incomplete observation of the examples, mirroring a pattern rather than the entire object.\n3.  **Lack of Object Interaction Understanding**: Beside basic color changes, there's more subtle interactions occurring, such as partial reflections.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Improve Color Mapping:** Abandon dynamic mapping and implement a robust static color mapping derived from all training examples.\n2.  **Refine Mirroring/Reflection:**\n    *   Generalize the mirroring logic to apply to multiple colors, or remove the hardcoded color dependency.\n    *   Accurately determine the mirroring axis (vertical, horizontal, or both) dynamically for each object, rather than assuming a fixed vertical axis.\n    *   Ensure that partial reflection can take place by carefully determining the boundaries of reflected area.\n3.  **Simplify:** Removing the unused `find_objects` and related functions will streamline the process and make it easier to manage.\n\n**Example Metrics and Observations:**\n\nTo better understand the transformations, I need more precise measurements of object properties. I'll use a python tool to inspect the input and output grids.\n\n"
