facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    description: 2D array of color values (0-9)

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    description: 2D array of color values (0-9), transformed from input_grid

  - object: pixel
    type: element
    description: Individual cell in the grid, represented by a color value.

  - relationship: transformation
    type: many-to-many
    description: Each pixel in the input grid is processed by assessing neighboring pixels.

  - property: color_2
    type: trigger
    description: The color red (value 2) in the input grid seems to be a critical trigger for the transformation, almost like an "anchor."

  - action: replication
    type: color_propagation
    description: Colors adjacent to the trigger color (2) in the input are replicated or modified in the output, possibly based on their original color.

  - action: influence
      type: neighbor
      description: The output color of a pixel is likely affected by colors of pixels up, down, left, right.

  - action: influence
      type: diagonal_neighbor
      description: The output color of a pixel is possibly affected by colors of pixels diagonally adjacent.
