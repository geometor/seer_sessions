actions:
  - name: horizontal_propagation
    description:  Colors are transformed and propagated horizontally based on proximity to anchors.
    constraints:
        - Propagation direction can be left, right, or between anchors.
        - Propagation stops at grid edges or secondary anchors (gray).
        - Transformation rules change depending on direction and colors.

      description: specific transformation to the left of the anchor
  - name: transform_right
      description: specific transformation to the right of the anchor
  - name: mirroring
    description: Colors between anchors are mirrored based on their relative position to the anchors.
