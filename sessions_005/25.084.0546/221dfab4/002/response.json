            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a single example, and it's clear they don't generalize well to other examples. The core issue is that the initial program assumed that azure (8) areas in the *input* should *always* be azure in the output, and that other colors are simply placed on top. This is clearly wrong. The errors show a large number of mismatched pixels, indicating the rule needs substantial refinement. The expected color changes suggests some kind of fill, copy, or overlay operation, but it isn't consistent between these first two cases. Example two shows that non azure pixels of the input are not necessarily preserved, as in example one.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Assumptions:** We need to discard the assumption that azure in the input always translates to azure in the output.\n\n2.  **Object Identification:** Focus more precisely on identifying *all* objects in both input and output. The current `find_objects` function only looks for objects *not* in the background colors, but it seems like regions of background color can *become* objects, so this must change.\n\n3.  **Relationship Mapping:** Instead of assuming a simple \"overlay,\" we need to analyze the spatial relationship between input objects and output objects. For example, is an output object a transformed version of an input object (resized, recolored, moved), or is it something entirely new? Do objects in the input combine?\n\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated natural language program and code against *all* available examples after each modification.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nI'll use code execution to derive some useful metrics for both examples. This analysis should help pinpoint exactly where the code's logic breaks down.\n\n"
