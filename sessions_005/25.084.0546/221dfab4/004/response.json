            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy to refine the natural language program and the code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies contiguous regions of the *same* color as objects. However, it fails to capture the core transformation logic, which involves *changing* the colors of certain regions based on their neighbors. The \"Transformed Output\" simply replicates the \"Input\", leading to a large number of mismatched pixels. The key error is that the current logic simply copies identified objects to the output grid without any modification.  It does not account for color changes, nor does it consider any relationships *between* objects, only *within* an object (i.e., contiguity). The strategy needs to shift from merely identifying objects to understanding how neighboring objects of different colors influence each other's final colors.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Relationships:** Instead of just finding objects, focus on the *boundaries* between objects of *different* colors. The output color changes often occur at these boundaries.\n2.  **Identify Trigger and Target:** Determine which object (based on color or other properties) is the \"trigger\" for the color change and which is the \"target\".\n3.  **Characterize the Change:** Is the color change a simple replacement (e.g., blue becomes green), or is it more complex (e.g., the color depends on the number of neighbors of a certain color)?\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Start with a simple rule based on immediate neighbors and then refine it based on the errors observed in the examples.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nTo better quantify the errors, let's use `tool_code` to calculate some metrics about the incorrect pixels.\n\n"
