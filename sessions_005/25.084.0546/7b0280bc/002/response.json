The errors indicate that the color changes are not always correct and the top-left preservation isn't always working as intended and the diagonal connections are not always correct.\n\nHere's the strategy:\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example to pinpoint exactly where the discrepancies occur.\n2.  **Refine Color Change Rules:** The color change rules seem too simplistic. We need to consider the context more, maybe based on where those colors exist.\n3.  **Top-Left Preservation:** Ensure the logic for identifying and preserving the top-left object is robust.\n4.  **Diagonal consideration:** Review the DFS to confirm the adjacencies are correct\n\n**Gather Metrics and Evidence**\n\nTo get a clearer picture, I need specific metrics. I'll analyze using a python tool.\n\n"
