The predominant color in all examples is a background of grey (represented by '7', '8' or '9'). Within this background, there are distinct colored regions or \"objects.\" These objects are typically rectangular and composed of contiguous pixels of the same color. The transformation seems to selectively modify some of these colored regions, primarily focusing on the top-left most object of each distinct color, except when multiple such objects are connected. The change seems color specific.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
