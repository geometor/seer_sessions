Some colors disappear, others are replaced.\n*   The output grids appear to consist of larger, more uniform blocks of color compared to the more scattered and varied colors in the input.\n* There appear to be colors that dominate others when combined.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Start with color of the highest priority found anywhere in the grid, and replace all blocks connected to it. Repeat this process until there is only one block.\n3.  **Shape Transformation:** The identified and color-transformed blocks are then made rectangular. Each separate block becomes a solid rectangle of that one color.\n4. Output the color-combined grid.\n\n"
