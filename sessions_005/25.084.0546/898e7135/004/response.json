            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on identifying objects, removing those with colors 0, 7, and 9, and then drawing bounding boxes around the remaining objects. This approach failed dramatically on both examples. The transformed outputs bear little resemblance to the expected outputs. The core issue seems to be a misunderstanding of the underlying transformation rule. The bounding box approach and color removal is not correct. Instead, it seems a more complex color and object rearrangement is involved.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** We need to correctly identify individual objects based on color contiguity, as the current code attempts. This seems like a reasonable starting point.\n2.  **Color Mapping:** The provided code removes colors; however it seems like there should be a color reassignment. Analyze the input and output pairs to identify any consistent color mappings.\n3.  **Positional Transformation:** We must determine how to transform the grid itself. Is it object replacement? rearrangement?\n4. **Iterative Refinement:** Start with simple hypotheses and use the provided examples to verify assumptions.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's use `tool_code` to gather more specific information about the examples. I'll focus on color counts, object counts, and grid sizes for both input and expected output.\n\n"

The exact rule isn't clear yet.\n\nThe resizing and object placement strategies appear different in each case, though both relate to the spatial configuration of objects in input. We will need to determine if there is one rule that can be extended to accommodate all.\n"
