            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and the subsequent code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of copying the top row and expanding colors on the rightmost edge has significant flaws. It doesn't capture the core logic of the transformations, especially evident in Example 2. The \"right-side color expansion\" is misinterpreting the actual rule, and the random row replacement is too simplistic. The core concept seems to involve identifying segments of non-background color (non-azure) in the *input* and propagating them downwards in specific columns, *but only if the entire row matches the pattern established in the top row, for segments of the row that are not azure (8)*. The random row replacement is not a valid part of the logic.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Discard Random Replacement:** The random row replacement is incorrect. We need to identify rows that *exactly* match the pattern of the first row (excluding azure pixels) and apply a transformation *only* to those rows.\n2.  **Refine \"Right-Side\" Expansion:** It's not about the *rightmost* non-azure color. It's about propagating *any* non-azure color downwards *within its segment*, but only if its containing row has first been transformed to match the top row's non-azure pattern.\n3. **Segment Identification**: The propagation happens within segments. A segment would be defined as consecutive pixels along x axis that has same color.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Evidence:**\n\nLet's use code execution to analyze Example 2 more closely, particularly the input and expected output, to pinpoint the exact transformation rule. We'll look for relationships between rows in the input and the output.\n\n"
