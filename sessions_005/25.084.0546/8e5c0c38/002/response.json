However, it fails in several cases:\n\n1.  **Example 1:** It incorrectly removes pixels from some objects and fails to remove any from others. The primary issue seems to be that after removing one pixel, and the object becomes discontiguous and the code no longer processes all parts of it.\n2.  **Example 2:** It removes the top left pixel of some of the multi-colored 2s.\n\nThe strategy should be to modify the object identification and pixel removal logic to correctly handle cases with gaps, holes, or those otherwise not contiguous.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's analyze each example quantitatively:\n\n"
