Okay, let's analyze this ARC task example.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output grids are the same size (22x22).
*   The grids contain colored pixels, represented by digits 0-9. Most of the grid is filled with color 0 (white/background).
*   There are distinct colored objects within the grids.
*   The objects appear to be rectangular shapes of varying sizes.
*   The objects' positions and sometimes, shapes, are slightly changed between the input and output. Some of the colors change.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
observations:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      size: 22x22
      background_color: 0

  - object_1:
      input:
        color: 1 (blue)
        shape: irregular rectangle
        position: approximately centered, varies
      output:
        color: 1 (blue)
        shape: irregular rectangle
        position: approximately centered, varies

  - object_2:
      input:
        color: 6 (magenta)
        shape: partial rectangle, connected to blue object
        position: right side of blue object, near the center
      output:
       color: 6 (magenta)
       shape: partial rectangle, connected to blue
       position: right of blue, center

  - object_3:
       input:
         color: 2 (red)
         shape: irregular rectangle
         position: bottom, slightly right of center
       output:
          color: 2 (red)
          shape: irregular rectangle
          position: bottom, slightly right of center

 - object_4:
      input:
         color: 8 (azure)
         shape: irregular rectangle
         position: center left
      output:
          color: 8 (azure)
          shape: irregular rectangle
          position: center left

  - object_5:
       input:
         color: 4 (yellow)
         shape: irregular rectangle
         position: bottom center
       output:
          color: 4 (yellow)
          shape: irregular rectangle
          position: bottom center

  - transformation:
       type: modify_objects
       details: objects keep the position, but one pixel is removed from each object

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all colored, rectangular objects that are not color 0 (white/background).
2.  Iterate each identified object.
3.  Remove the left most pixel.
4.  Leave every other part of the grids unchanged.

In summary, the transformation seems to iterate through the objects, and remove the leftmost pixel. The objects preserve location.
