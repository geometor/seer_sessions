            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and the approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies contiguous objects and has a basic framework for checking adjacency. However, it fails to correctly apply the transformation rule in several cases. The primary issue seems to be a too-restrictive definition of adjacency or an error in how adjacency is checked and applied to transform *all* pixels within a connected red object. The code also doesn't handle the edge case where two red objects will combine to form a larger red object when a pixel is changed to yellow. It incorrectly changes individual pixels to yellow instead of entire objects. There also appears to be an issue ignoring the '7' value, as we see some instances of the '7' in the output.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Improve Object Identification/Adjacency:** Refine the `is_adjacent_to_object_of_color` function. The current version might be prematurely exiting or not correctly traversing adjacent pixels.\n2.  **Whole Object Transformation:** Ensure that when a transformation condition is met (red object adjacent to another red object), the *entire* object's pixels are changed to yellow, not just the adjacent ones.\n3. Review and correct ignore logic.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis, code execution not necessary for this level of observation):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   The most obvious error: Red objects adjacent to other red objects were not changed to yellow.\n    * There is also an error when two red objects become a single contiguous object, they do not merge to change to yellow.\n    *   There is also an error where a 7 is present when it shouldn't be in row two, column 22.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Similar to example 1, adjacent red objects are not transformed.\n    * The '7' value appears to be ignored, which is not the desired behavior.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Adjacent red objects are not transformed.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   The two separate red objects on rows 2 and 3 should be converted to yellow.\n\n**YAML Fact Representation:**\n\n"
