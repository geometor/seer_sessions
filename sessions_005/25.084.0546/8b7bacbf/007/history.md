1.  **Object Identification:** Identify distinct objects within the grid. An object is a contiguous group of pixels of the same color. Contiguous means connected horizontally or vertically. Ignore objects of color 7.

2.  **Iterate:** For each identified object:

3.  **Red Object Transformation:**
    *   If the object's color is red (2):
        *   Check if the object is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to *another* object of color red (2).
        *   If it *is* adjacent to another red (2) object, change all pixels within the object to yellow (4).

4.  **Preservation:** All other objects maintain their colors and positions.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and the approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies contiguous objects and has a basic framework for checking adjacency. However, it fails to correctly apply the transformation rule in several cases. The primary issue seems to be a too-restrictive definition of adjacency or an error in how adjacency is checked and applied to transform *all* pixels within a connected red object. The code also doesn't handle the edge case where two red objects will combine to form a larger red object when a pixel is changed to yellow. It incorrectly changes individual pixels to yellow instead of entire objects. There also appears to be an issue ignoring the '7' value, as we see some instances of the '7' in the output.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Improve Object Identification/Adjacency:** Refine the `is_adjacent_to_object_of_color` function. The current version might be prematurely exiting or not correctly traversing adjacent pixels.
2.  **Whole Object Transformation:** Ensure that when a transformation condition is met (red object adjacent to another red object), the *entire* object's pixels are changed to yellow, not just the adjacent ones.
3. Review and correct ignore logic.

**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis, code execution not necessary for this level of observation):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   The most obvious error: Red objects adjacent to other red objects were not changed to yellow.
    * There is also an error when two red objects become a single contiguous object, they do not merge to change to yellow.
    *   There is also an error where a 7 is present when it shouldn't be in row two, column 22.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Similar to example 1, adjacent red objects are not transformed.
    * The '7' value appears to be ignored, which is not the desired behavior.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Adjacent red objects are not transformed.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   The two separate red objects on rows 2 and 3 should be converted to yellow.

**YAML Fact Representation:**

    transformations:

        initial_state: multiple
        adjacency_rule: adjacent_to_same_color
        final_state: yellow_contiguous_region
        notes: Does not transform correctly to all yellow.

general_rules:
    - object_identification: Contiguous pixels of the same color form an object.
    - color_transformation_rule: "Red objects adjacent to other red objects become yellow."
    - adjacency: "Horizontal or vertical connection."
    - color_7: "Ignore objects of color 7 during processing, but preserve them in place"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Object Identification:** Identify all distinct objects within the grid. An object is defined as a group of one or more contiguous pixels of the same color. Contiguity is defined by horizontal or vertical adjacency (not diagonal).

2. **Ignore 7:** Any object of color 7 should be ignored by the processing, but its position in the grid is maintained.

3.  **Red Object Processing:**
    *   Iterate through each identified object.
    *   If an object is red (color value 2), check for adjacency to *any other* red object.
    *   Adjacency is defined as having at least one pixel in the first object that is directly above, below, to the left, or to the right of a pixel in another distinct red object.
    *   If any part of a red object is adjacent to any part of another red object, change *all* pixels within *both* of those red objects to yellow (color value 4).

4.  **Preservation:** Any objects that are not red, or red objects that are *not* adjacent to other red objects, remain unchanged.

5.  **Output:** The output grid should maintain the original dimensions of the input grid, with the transformations applied.
