            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe core task appears to involve a selective color replacement/copying within the grid. Certain colored objects in the input grid seem to have their colors *selectively* changed in the output grid, under specific geometric and/or color-based rules, which seem quite context-dependent.  The color white (0) acts like a background and doesn't seem to undergo transformations directly. The operations aren't simple global replacements; the context of neighboring pixels matters. Specifically:\n\n1.  **Context-Sensitive Color Changes:** The changes aren't uniform. A color '2' (red) might change to a '4' (yellow) in one location but remain unchanged in another. This suggests a dependency on surrounding pixels.\n\n2.  **Shapes/Objects:** Contiguous regions of the same color can be treated as single objects. This prior is crucial.\n\n3.  **Potential Triggers:** It is important to look at all examples.\n    *   In `train_1`, color `1` (blue) is next to a `7` (orange), and there are instances of the same shape of `2`(red) being replaced with `7`(orange).\n    *   In `train_2`, it shows instances of some shapes of `2` (red) being replaced with `4` (yellow).\n    *   In `train_3`, it shows instances of some shapes of `2` (red) being replaced with `4` (yellow).\n    *   In `train_4`, it shows instances of some shapes of `2` (red) being replaced with `4` (yellow).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

It prioritizes checking adjacent pixels for red and yellow before enacting a color change, making the transformation context-sensitive. It also takes into account the `7` color.\n"
