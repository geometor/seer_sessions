Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

*   The input and output grids are of the same dimensions (22x22).
*   The grids mostly consist of a single background color (4 in the first example, 3 in the second, and 7 in the third).
*   There are smaller objects or shapes within the grids, represented by different colors (2 and 8 in the first example, 1 and 2 in the second, 4, and 6 in the third).
*   The transformation seems to involve some form of object interaction or movement, and potentially copying or mirroring.
*   It looks like objects in input might move or being replaced according to certain pattern.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - background:
      color:
        example1: 4
        example2: 3
        example3: 7
      description: The dominant color filling most of the grid.
  - foreground_objects:
      colors:
        example1: [2, 8]
        example2: [1,2]
        example3: [4,6]
      description: Smaller shapes or patterns within the grid, different from the background color.
      properties:
        - shape: Objects seem to form compact shapes, often rectangular.
        - position: Positions change between input and output.
        - size: Size seems to either stay same or be slightly increased.
actions:
  - movement_replacement:
     description: Foregound objects seems to be moving and/or being replaced by background color, according to patterns in other foregound objects.
relationships:
  - spatial:
      description: The relative positions of foreground objects seem to influence the transformation.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Background and Foreground:** Determine the background color (the most frequent color) and the foreground colors (all other colors).
2.  **Iterate Rows or columns:** Iterate through input row by row (example 1 and 2), or, in case of third example, reflect the objects within the grid.
3.  **Locate and Process Objects:**
    *   If on a solid color of input, find the non-background object(s).
4.    **Move, Copy/Replace:**
	*  Iterate through the Input, when encounter the first colored object, shift the rows above it down, fill the shifted rows with the encountered colored object.
	* When a non-background color pixel encountered in input, replace pixels by background color.
	* Find colored objects in each row, copy and increase in next row.

5.  **Output:** Generate the modified grid.

In other words:
*  Example 1:
    *   Locate the red(2) object. Copy it to the row below. Shift rows containing blue(8) object down.
*  Example 2:
    *   Locate blue(1) object, invert it and place it at the top of the output. Copy Red(2) objects and place it below blue(1) object.
*  Example 3:
    *   Locate the position of the yellow(4) object. Shift rows containing magenta(6) object based on yellow(4) object position. The yellow(4) object moves to the positions of magenta(6) objects.
