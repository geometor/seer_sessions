            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example pairs, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.  The input and output grids are mostly the same size, but some rows can be inserted or deleted, especially solid colored rows of 6s, 8s, 2s, or 3s. The core transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of certain color regions (objects) based on their surroundings, and insertion of solid rows. The background color seems to be 8 in most places. The transformation is not a simple pixel-by-pixel mapping, but it depends on the adjacent color values.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

For each pixel, examine the 3x3 region centered on that pixel. If all eight surrounding pixels are azure (8), and the center pixel is *not* azure (8) change the center pixel's color to green (3).\n\n2.  **Solid Rows:** Rows that are entirely of the same color are mostly unchanged.  But, some rows of 8s will be changed to 3s, or may be deleted.  There are many such rows, so it is not clear which will change.\n\n3.  **Other regions:** Other regions of color in non-solid rows seem to stay mostly the same, with the 3x3 azure rule from step 1 being the main exception.\n\nEssentially, the program identifies \"isolated\" non-azure pixels surrounded by azure pixels and changes their color to green, and it manages the insertion and deletion of special solid rows. The other pixels do not seem to follow any discernible rule.\n"
