observations:
  - object_type: grid
    description: 2D array of color values (0-9)
  - object_type: contiguous_region
    description: A group of adjacent pixels of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: Integer (0-9) representing the color.
      - shape: Irregular, defined by the pixel arrangement.
  - object_type: solid_row
    description: insertion and deletion of rows, where all pixels have the same value.
    properties:
      - color: Integer representing the solid color (often 6, 8, 2 or 3)
      - row: index

  - relationship_type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
  - transformation_type: color_replacement
    description: Certain contiguous regions have their color changed based on surrounding regions.
  - transformation_type: insert_row
    description: Insert a solid color row.
  - transformation_type: delete_row
    description: Delete a solid color row.

rules:
  - condition: "A 3x3 region of azure (8) is present with an isolated pixel inside it."
    action: "Change the color of the pixel in that 3x3 region to green (3)"
  - condition: "A 1-pixel region exists"
    action: "Check the surrounding 3x3 region centered on each pixel. If surrounded by azure (8), replace it with green (3)."
  - condition: "Rows of all 8s exist"
    action: "These are largely unchanged, but some may be deleted. Some are changed to 3s"
  - condition: "Rows of all 6s exist"
    action: "These rows seem mostly unchanged"
  - condition: "Rows of all 2s exist"
      action: "These are mostly unchanged.  Some rows of 8s can change to 2s"
