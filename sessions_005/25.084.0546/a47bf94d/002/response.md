Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for updating the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The code performs reasonably well at identifying objects and reflecting the azure (color 8) objects. However, it struggles with the placement and color of the inserted single pixels. The core issue is the logic used to determine *where* to insert the new pixels and *which* color to use. The current implementation's counting and indexing logic is flawed and doesn't correctly capture the symmetrical insertion rule relative to the center line and azure objects. It seems the original assumption about the placement relative to the colored object was not right, instead the placement is determined relative to the location of the azure (color 8 objects).

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Object Identification:** The current object identification is sufficient.

2.  **Correct Insertion Logic:**
    *   The inserted pixels should be placed symmetrically around the vertical center line of the grid.
    *   The placement and color of inserted pixel depends of the position of the azure (color 8) objects and the non-azure, non-black objects.

3.  **Improve Color Handling:** Make color selection for insertion explicit and based on the original object's color before transformation.

4.  **YAML and NL Program Clarity:** Refactor the YAML and natural language program for clarity and precision, focusing on the center-line symmetry and the conditions for object insertion.
