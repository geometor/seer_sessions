            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the natural language program and the corresponding code:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and code were a good first attempt, capturing the basic idea of object identification, azure object reflection, and insertion of colored pixels. However, the execution results reveal several critical errors:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Reflection and Insertion Logic:** The reflection and insertion logic is flawed, especially in how it handles the position and number of inserted pixels relative to the azure objects. Example 1 highlights problems placing pixels near reflected objects and determining color, and Example 2 has significant placement issues.\n2.  **Asymmetric Insertion:** The code doesn't correctly handle the symmetric insertion of colored pixels around the *centerline* relative to azure objects. It appears to count azure objects but miscalculates insertion points. The correct rule seems to be to insert a colored pixel for *each* azure object *on each side* of the center.\n3. **Object Interaction:** The implementation could be more general when defining object properties.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Ensure the `find_objects` function works correctly and can handle various object shapes and arrangements. We can leave this as it is because it seems to be working.\n2.  **Correct Reflection:** Make the reflection logic place an object of the same size and shape on the opposite side of the grid.\n3.  **Precise Insertion Rule:** Implement the insertion rule based on a clear understanding of symmetry and counting.\n4. **Centerline determination**: The code needs to accurately determine the center line of the image, especially for the insert operations.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis**\n\nI'll use code execution to extract some grid properties.\n\n"
