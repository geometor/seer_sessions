Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The current code has significant errors. It seems to be misinterpreting the core rule, particularly regarding how non-azure objects are handled and where/how the insertion occurs. The reflection of azure objects seems partially correct, but the placement of other colored pixels is way off. The strategy will involve:

1.  **Correcting Pixel Insertion Logic:** The primary issue is the incorrect placement of colored pixels based on azure counts. We need to revisit this logic entirely, paying close attention to *which* objects influence the insertion and the *exact* insertion position relative to the center.
2.  **Addressing Object Selection:** It seems the code may be processing *parts* of objects multiple times (or not at all), resulting in incorrect counts and placements. We need to double-check that we're treating each contiguous colored region as a single object, and only performing a single transformation per object per relevant row.
3. **Reviewing Edge Cases** The current implementation might fail when the azure color or other color is not found. We will have to consider these edge cases.

**Gather Metrics and Evidence:**

I need to determine the exact positions of the misplacement, and if there's any pattern (like off by a certain number, consistent misinterpretation of relative positions, etc.)
