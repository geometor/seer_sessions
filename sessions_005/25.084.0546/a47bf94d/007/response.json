Record the color and shape (coordinates) of each object.\n\n2.  **Azure Object Reflection:** For each object with color azure (8):\n    *   Create a reflected copy of the object. The reflected object's position is determined by mirroring its coordinates across the grid's vertical center line.  The reflected copy has same color as original.\n    *   Keep the original azure colored object.\n\n3.  **Non-Azure Object Transformation and Insertion:**\n    *   Iterate through each *row* of the input grid.\n    *   For each non-azure, non-white object *found in that row*:\n        *   Count the number of distinct azure objects to the *left* of the center column in the *entire grid*.\n        *   Insert a single pixel of the object's color to the left of the center column, at a distance equal to the count of left-side azure objects. The row of insertion is the same as the row being iterated.\n        *   Count the number of distinct azure objects to the *right* of the center column (including the center column if the grid width is odd) in the *entire grid*.\n        *   Insert a single pixel of the object's color to the right of the center, at a distance equal to the right-side azure objects count. The row of insertion is the same as the row being iterated.\n\n4.  **Output Construction:** Create the output grid by placing all original azure objects, reflected azure objects, and inserted pixels onto a blank grid of the same dimensions as the input. All other cells become white.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds contiguous objects of the same color in a grid.\"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols\n\n    def dfs(r, c, color, obj):\n        if (r, c) in visited or not is_valid(r, c) or grid[r, c] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        obj.append((r, c))\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            dfs(r + dr, c + dc, color, obj)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if (r, c) not in visited and grid[r,c] != 0:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                obj = []\n                dfs(r, c, color, obj)\n                objects.append((color, obj))\n    return objects\n\ndef reflect_object(obj, width):\n    \"\"\"Reflects an object horizontally across the center of the grid.\"\"\"\n    reflected_obj = []\n    for r, c in obj:\n        reflected_c = width - 1 - c\n        reflected_obj.append((r, reflected_c))\n    return reflected_obj\n\ndef count_all_azure_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"Counts azure objects to the left and right of the center in entire grid\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    center_col = cols // 2\n    is_odd = cols % 2 != 0\n    left_count = 0\n    right_count = 0\n    visited = set()\n\n     # Count distinct azure objects to the left\n    for r in range(rows):\n      for c in range(center_col):\n          if grid[r, c] == 8 and (r, c) not in visited:\n              left_count += 1\n              # DFS to mark the entire object as visited\n              stack = [(r, c)]\n              while stack:\n                  cr, cc = stack.pop()\n                  if (cr, cc) not in visited and 0 <= cr < rows and 0 <= cc < cols and grid[cr,cc] == 8:\n                      visited.add((cr,cc))\n                      for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                          stack.append((cr+dr, cc+dc))\n\n    # Count distinct azure objects to the right\n    for r in range(rows):\n      for c in range(center_col + (1 if is_odd else 0), cols):\n          if grid[r, c] == 8 and (r, c) not in visited:\n              right_count += 1\n               # DFS to mark the entire object as visited\n              stack = [(r, c)]\n              while stack:\n                  cr, cc = stack.pop()\n                  if (cr, cc) not in visited and 0 <= cr < rows and 0 <= cc < cols and grid[cr,cc] == 8:\n                      visited.add((cr,cc))\n                      for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                          stack.append((cr+dr, cc+dc))\n    return left_count, right_count\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the described rules.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    center_col = cols // 2\n    is_odd = cols % 2 != 0\n\n    # Find objects in the input grid\n    objects = find_objects(input_grid)\n\n    # Reflect azure objects\n    for color, obj_coords in objects:\n        if color == 8:  # azure\n            for r, c in obj_coords:\n                output_grid[r, c] = color # Keep original object\n            reflected_coords = reflect_object(obj_coords, cols)\n            for r, c in reflected_coords:\n                output_grid[r, c] = color  # Add reflection\n\n    left_azure_count, right_azure_count = count_all_azure_objects(input_grid)\n\n    # Iterate through each row\n    for row in range(rows):\n        # Find non-azure, non-white objects in the current row\n        row_objects = []\n        for color, obj_coords in objects:\n            if color != 8 and color != 0:\n              for r,c in obj_coords:\n                if r == row:\n                  row_objects.append((color, obj_coords))\n                  break # only consider one instance per object\n\n        for color, obj_coords in row_objects:\n\n            # Insert to the left\n            insert_col_left = center_col - 1 - left_azure_count\n            if insert_col_left >= 0:\n                output_grid[row, insert_col_left] = color\n\n            # Insert to the right\n            insert_col_right = center_col + (1 if is_odd else 0) + right_azure_count -1\n            if insert_col_right < cols:\n                output_grid[row, insert_col_right] = color\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
