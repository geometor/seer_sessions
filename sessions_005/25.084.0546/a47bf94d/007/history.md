"""
1.  **Object Identification:** Identify all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a contiguous set of pixels of the same non-zero color. Record the color and shape (coordinates) of each object.

2.  **Azure Object Reflection:** For each object with color azure (8):
    *   Create a reflected copy of the object. The reflected object's position is determined by mirroring its coordinates across the grid's vertical center line.  The reflected copy has same color as original.
    *   Keep the original azure colored object.

3.  **Non-Azure Object Transformation and Insertion:**
    * For each row in the grid and for each non-azure, non-white object in that row:
        *  Find the number of distinct azure objects to the left of the center column.  Insert one pixel of this non-azure object's color to the left of the center by the number of azure objects on that side. The inserted pixel's row is the same as the row of object being processed. The column is calculated to maintain the appropriate distance from the center.
        *  Find the number of distinct azure objects to the right of the center column (inclusive of center if width is odd). Insert one pixel of this object's color, mirrored horizontally, to the right of the center by the number of azure objects to that side.  The inserted pixel's row is the same as the row of the object being processed.

4.  **Output Construction:** Create the output grid by placing all original azure objects, reflected azure objects, and inserted pixels onto a blank grid of the same dimensions as the input. All other cells become white.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The current code has significant errors. It seems to be misinterpreting the core rule, particularly regarding how non-azure objects are handled and where/how the insertion occurs. The reflection of azure objects seems partially correct, but the placement of other colored pixels is way off. The strategy will involve:

1.  **Correcting Pixel Insertion Logic:** The primary issue is the incorrect placement of colored pixels based on azure counts. We need to revisit this logic entirely, paying close attention to *which* objects influence the insertion and the *exact* insertion position relative to the center.
2.  **Addressing Object Selection:** It seems the code may be processing *parts* of objects multiple times (or not at all), resulting in incorrect counts and placements. We need to double-check that we're treating each contiguous colored region as a single object, and only performing a single transformation per object per relevant row.
3. **Reviewing Edge Cases** The current implementation might fail when the azure color or other color is not found. We will have to consider these edge cases.

**Gather Metrics and Evidence:**

I need to determine the exact positions of the misplacement, and if there's any pattern (like off by a certain number, consistent misinterpretation of relative positions, etc.)
