Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The code performs horizontal expansion of foreground pixels, but it seems to have issues with:

1.  **Stopping Expansion:** It doesn't always correctly stop expansion when encountering a different color. In Example 1, it fails to expand the 6's on row 8 all the way to the right edge.
2.  **Multi-Foreground Handling:** Does not correctly extend to the end when the encountered color is also a foreground color. In Example 2, Some 3's are not fully expanded.

The strategy will be to:

1.  **Refine Stopping Condition:** Modify the code to correctly stop expansion when a *different* foreground color is encountered or the border.
2.  **Simplify Multi-Foreground logic**: The logic may be getting overly complicated. We may be able to assume foreground is always singular.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's analyze Example 1 closely using a custom function to pinpoint error locations.
