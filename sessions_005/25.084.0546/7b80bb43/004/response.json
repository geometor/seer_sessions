In Example 1, it fails to expand the 6's on row 8 all the way to the right edge.\n2.  **Multi-Foreground Handling:** Does not correctly extend to the end when the encountered color is also a foreground color. In Example 2, Some 3's are not fully expanded.\n\nThe strategy will be to:\n\n1.  **Refine Stopping Condition:** Modify the code to correctly stop expansion when a *different* foreground color is encountered or the border.\n2.  **Simplify Multi-Foreground logic**: The logic may be getting overly complicated. We may be able to assume foreground is always singular.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's analyze Example 1 closely using a custom function to pinpoint error locations.\n\n"
