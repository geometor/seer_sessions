Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output grids are of different dimensions. The output grids appear to be smaller than the input grids.
*   Both input and output contain various colors (represented by digits 0-9).
*   There's a recurring pattern of '5' (gray) in the output, often forming a frame or background.
*   Other colors within the '5' frame in the output seem to be derived from the input, but with a change in position and arrangement. It appears that clusters of 3x3 from the input are compressed into single pixels. It also looks like some colors are altered in the compression (e.g. 3 -> 4, 6 -> 7)
*   The central parts of the input grids seem to have a significant influence on the output grids.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]
      - dimensions: variable (large)

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]
      - dimensions: variable (smaller than input)
      - background_color: 5 (gray)

  - name: 3x3_input_block
     type: subgrid
     properties:
        - dimensions: 3x3

actions:
  - name: compress_block
    description: Condenses a 3x3 block from the input grid into a single pixel in the output grid.
    parameters:
      - input: 3x3 block
      - output: single pixel

  - name: recolor
      description: certain colors change

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid is derived from a central region of the input grid, with a reduction in size.
  - type: correspondence
    description: 3x3 blocks in the input correspond to single pixels in the output.
  - type: color_transformation
    description: during the transformation from the 3x3 to a pixel, values are mapped to different values.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Frame the Output:** Create an output grid with a gray (5) background. The dimensions of this grid are determined by identifying the repeating structure in the center.

2.  **Center Extraction:** conceptually divide the input grid regions of 3x3 blocks, starting one pixel in from the top left, stepping by one pixel, and ending one pixel in on the bottom right.

3.  **Block Compression:** For each 3x3 block in the input, reduce it to a single pixel in the output. The mapping for the examples is:

    - If input block contains 3s then change 3->4
    - If input block contains 6s then change 6->7
    - If input block contains 8s then change 8->2
    - If input block contains 2s then change 2->8
    - If input block contains 1s then change 1->8
    - If input block contains 4s then change 4->2

4. **Placement**: Place the compressed pixel in output grid.

5. **Fill in the 5's:** Fill the top and bottom rows, and leftmost and rightmost columns, of the output grid with 5s.
