In these examples, we mostly see colors 7 (orange), 6 (magenta), 2 (red), and potentially others.\n*   **Objects:** There are contiguous blocks of the same color which we can consider as objects.\n* **Change:** Comparing each input with the output, it looks like the output has added a vertical border of color 6 (magenta), and there's selective insertion/change/addition of magenta within the body.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

If there is already magenta at a particular position, it should remain unchanged.\n\n2.  **Overlay/Fill**: Starting from the leftmost column, replace orange (color 7) pixels with magenta (color 6) in a way that creates proximity or fills in 'gaps', 'holes', or 'empty' areas next to and around the red shapes. Stop expanding the magenta when no more red shapes or 'gaps' can be immediately filled. Consider the concept of erosion and expansion.\n\nThe transformation seems to expand the magenta color on the left, then fills regions next to the red color blocks.\n"
