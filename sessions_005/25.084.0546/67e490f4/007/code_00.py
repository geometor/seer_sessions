"""
1.  **Input:** Receive a 2D grid (`input_grid`) of color values.

2. **Output Grid Dimensions** The size of the output grid is determined by the distribution of colors within the input. It appears to be a simplification of the input based on prominent color regions.
3.  **Identify Prominent Colors:** Determine which colors are the "output" colors by excluding any colors with a count of less than an arbitrary threshold. The value of the threshold can be considered the minimum number of times a color appears.
4. **Simplified Representation:**
    * Create a simplified, lower-resolution representation of the input grid. The output dimensions vary and don't directly correspond to a simple division of input dimensions.
    *  The specific logic connecting regions of the input grid to the output grid is more complex than simple 3x3 block averaging.  It's likely related to identifying contiguous or significant regions of each prominent color, but not in a strict grid-aligned way. It is more accurate to represent the input as having regions of prominent colors.
5.  **Construct Output:** Create an `output_grid` based on the identified color regions.
6. **Populate Output:**
    *   Fill cells in the output grid with a color from the set of prominent colors.
    *   The placement logic isn't a simple block-wise mapping.
