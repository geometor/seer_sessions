Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** The input appears to be a 30x30 grid filled predominantly with the color blue (1), with scattered clusters of other colors (red (2), green(3), yellow(4), grey(5), magenta(6), orange(7), azure(8), maroon(9)). The other colors often form small 2x2 or 3x3 squares, and sometimes lines.
*   **Output:** The output is a smaller, seemingly irregular grid (e.g., 11x13 in example 1).
*    The ouput grid appears to be composed by blocks 3X3 of the input grid.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve some form of downsampling or summarizing of the input grid. The output grid retains some of the colors from the input, but in a compressed form. There are no obvious rotations, reflections, or complex shape manipulations. The transformation focuses on retaining certain color information while significantly reducing the grid size. The rule must identify some characteristic or a feature of 3x3 sections of input and use the rule output to construct.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 30x30
    elements: color_pixels
    properties:
      - color_distribution: Primarily blue, with scattered clusters of other colors.
      - color_cluster_shapes: Often 2x2 or 3x3 squares, sometimes lines.

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: variable # 11X13 and 13x11
    elements: color_pixels
    properties:
      - color_relation_to_input:  Colors present in the output are also present in the input.
      - size_relation_to_input: Significantly smaller than the input grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide and Conquer:** Divide the input 30x30 grid into non-overlapping 3x3 blocks.
2.  **Block Analysis, and Selection:** For each 3x3 block in the input grid, find the cell with the most occurrences within the 3x3 block.
3.  **Output Construction, and Placement:** Output the most frequent number in each block. Output is in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, where top-to-bottom is the major order, and left-to-right is the minor order.
