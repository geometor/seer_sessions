Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Task Elements:**

The task involves 30x30 grids containing numerical digits, representing colors. The transformation seems to focus on changing specific colored regions within the grid while leaving the background unchanged. I notice changes in colors where multiple objects in the image input change to the same objects.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**

```yaml
task_id: ARC_example
observations:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: [30, 30]
    elements: integers # Representing colors
    background_color: variable # Changes in different examples.

  - type: objects
    description: Contiguous blocks of same-colored pixels.
    properties:
      - color: integer
      - shape: variable
      - size: variable # Number of pixels in the block.
      - position: variable # (row, col) coordinates.

  - type: transformation
    description: "Color changes within specific objects, other pixels are uneffected"
    actions:
      - select_object_group: Selects groups of object
        criteria:
          - same color
          - same size and shape
      - change_color_same:
        description: changes color value of a set of objects to be the same

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of multiple objects. Each object is a contiguous region of pixels with the same color.

2.  **Find object groups** Identify a set of object in the grid.

3. **Determine color transformation.** If there are more than 1 objects in the group, and there is any objects of a size greater than 1, select the smallest size objects.

4. **Apply color change:** change the color of all the selected objects, and leave other pixels in the image uneffected.

In short - identify objects in the grid, find objects of the same size and shape and color, and determine a new color, and apply this color transformation.
