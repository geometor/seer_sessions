            "text": "Okay, here's an analysis of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a single training example and made several assumptions that don't hold true across all examples. The primary issue is that the code is overly specific, focusing on identifying objects of the same size, shape, and color, and then applying a color transformation based on a hardcoded `color_remap` dictionary. This approach is brittle and doesn't generalize well. The timeout error suggests the code is also inefficient, likely due to the depth-first search (`dfs`) function and the way objects are grouped and processed. The code also has specific checks, such as if there are multiples of a object, or checking size, which are too specific.\n\nThe strategy for resolving these errors is to:\n\n1.  **Simplify the object identification:** Focus on identifying objects based on contiguity and color, without initially worrying about size or shape.\n2.  **Abstract the color transformation:** Instead of a hardcoded mapping, we need to find a more general rule for how colors change. This might involve looking at the relative positions of objects, their initial colors, or other contextual clues.\n3.  **Improve Efficiency:** Optimize the `dfs` if needed, and possibly rethink how to use `numpy`.\n4. **Look at all tasks**: Abandon current code and look at all the examples.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Example Analysis:**\nI will examine all examples to determine a transformation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
