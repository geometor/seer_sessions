Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on elements, a YAML block for facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids filled primarily with the color azure (8).  Within these grids, there are distinct regions of other colors (objects). The transformation seems to involve *selectively* removing or shifting some of these colored regions, while leaving others intact. The azure (8) background is largely untouched, acting as a static canvas. The key challenge is figuring out which colored regions are modified and which are not, and the logic behind that selection. It appears that the relative positioning/alignment of colored regions to each other might play an important role.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task: selective_removal_or_shift
objects:
  - type: colored_region
    properties:
      color: [red(2), green(3), yellow(4), magenta(6), orange(7), blue(1)]
      shape: [irregular, rectangular]  # Observing both possibilities
      size: [variable]
      position: [row, col] # relative and absolute coordinate
    actions:
      - remove
      - shift #horizontally
      - keep

  - type: background
    properties:
     color: azure(8)
    actions:
     - keep # The background is not modified

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    properties:
    - horizontal
    - vertical
    - diagonal
  - type: alignment #row or col
    properties:
     - horizontal
     - vertical

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colored Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of pixels that are *not* azure (8). These are our "colored regions".

2.  **Analyze Relationships:** For each colored region, examine its relationship with *other* colored regions. Specifically, check for:
    *   **Horizontal Alignment:** Are there other colored regions on the same row?
    *   **Vertical Alignment:** Are there any other colored regions that are aligned on one or more of the same columns, possibly shifted up or down relative to the current one?

3.  **Conditional Modification:**
    *   Colored regions that exist on empty rows are kept.
    *  Colored regions not on empty rows:
       * keep regions of the same color that exist in vertical adjaceny.
       * Move other colors to the rows according to some shift and alignment logic.

4. **Background Preservation:** The azure (8) background remains unchanged.

**Overall Story**
There appears to be a background made of 8 (azure) which does not change. Other colors appear in blocks, and in rows that do not contain other colors, they remain. In rows containing more than one color, there is selection logic. Colors that appear aligned and are of the same type remain, other colors are modified according to some relationship based on position and type.
