However, it fails to capture the core logic of the transformation, which involves *shifting* and *combining* colored regions based on their vertical relationships and colors. The strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Refine Region Identification:**  Ensure the code accurately identifies all distinct colored regions. The current DFS approach seems sound.\n2.  **Vertical Alignment Detection:**  Improve the logic to detect vertically aligned regions *of different colors*. The current code only detects vertically adjacent regions of the same color.\n3. **Shifting and Combining Logic:** Implement the core transformation. Regions not on \"empty\" rows in the input should move up. If the columns of the regions of different colors are aligned, merge them, creating a combined colored region. If rows are empty, the regions must be kept intact.\n4.  **Address Edge Cases:** Pay close attention to the examples to see if other edge cases exist.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis and the provided pixel diffs):**\n\n*   **Example 1:** The code eliminates all non-azure pixels because none of the colored regions are on empty rows *and* are vertically adjacent to same-colored regions. The correct output shows a complex merging of regions. Pixels off: 22.\n*   **Example 2:** Similar to Example 1, all colored regions are removed. The expected output shows merging. Pixels off: 30.\n*   **Example 3:** Again, complete removal of colored regions. The correct output shows merging and shifting. Pixels off: 34.\n\nThese examples show consistent errors. The number of pixels off also appears to be related to the total colored pixels present in the non-empty rows. The code is incorrectly *removing* regions instead of *transforming* them. It fails to implement a concept of shifting/combining that is clearly present in the expected outputs.\n\n**YAML Fact Base**\n\n"
