"""
1.  **Identify Regions:** Find all contiguous colored regions (non-azure pixels) in the input grid. Each region is defined by the (row, column) coordinates of its pixels and its color.

2.  **Check for Top Empty Rows:** For each region, check if its *topmost* row in the original input grid is composed entirely of azure pixels.

3.  **Stack All Regions:** Stack *all* regions, preserving their shapes. The stacking order is determined by the regions' original vertical positions (topmost regions go first). Regions whose topmost row was empty in the input grid are *not* moved from their original positions.
    - The stacking occurs from the top of the grid downwards.

4. **Output:** Generate the output grid by keeping the regions at original position (from step 2) and by placing the shifted/combined regions from step 3. The azure background remains unchanged.
