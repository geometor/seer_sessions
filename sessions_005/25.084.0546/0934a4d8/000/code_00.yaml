objects:
  - grid:
      type: input
      description: A 2D array of colored pixels (0-9).
      shape: Irregular, varies between examples.
      properties:
        - colors: Contains a variety of colors.
        - size: Relatively large (e.g., 30x30).
  - grid:
      type: output
      description: A 2D array of colored pixels (0-9).
      shape: Rectangular.
      properties:
        - colors: Subset of colors from the input grid.
        - size: Significantly smaller than the input grid.

actions:
  - sampling:
      description: Selecting specific pixels from the input grid to form the output grid.
      parameters:
        - selection_criteria:  Needs to be determined (not a simple geometric pattern).

relationships:
  - input_to_output:  The output grid is derived from the input grid through a non-trivial sampling process.
  - color_consistency: Colors in the output grid exist in the input grid.
  - object_consistency: The relationship between rows, columns or subgrids within the input and output are not directly apparent.
