The output grids appear to be composed of elements sampled from the input grids, but the selection criteria are not immediately obvious. There's no clear geometric transformation (like rotation or scaling). There appears to be different objects. It also appears that colors may be important. The size of output is different.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

It looks like a rectangle of height no greater than any of the examples.\n3. **Sample Pixels:** Iterate the columns of each object, from left to right, select pixels and put them into the output columns.\n4. **Form Output:** Assemble the selected pixels to create the smaller, rectangular output grid.\n\nThe core challenge is to figure out step two, the criteria. The selected rectangle seems arbitrary.\n"
