The output grid seems to represent a simplified version of the input, but it's not a direct sampling of rows. Instead, the output appears to be constructed by identifying certain key features or objects from the input, potentially those that are most prominent or have specific spatial relationships, and representing only those features in a condensed format. The selection process for which features to include isn't based on a fixed size or simple downsampling. It's more likely based on a combination of factors such as object size, color frequency, or relative positions.\n\nThe current hypothesis, based on the dream and failed execution, focuses\non finding prominent rows of objects and extracting these into a condensed form.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identify contiguous objects of the same color in the grid.\n    Returns a dictionary of objects, where keys are colors and values are lists of coordinates.\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = {}\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n\n    def dfs(r, c, color, obj):\n        if (r, c) in visited or r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols or grid[r][c] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        obj.append((r, c))\n        dfs(r + 1, c, color, obj)\n        dfs(r - 1, c, color, obj)\n        dfs(r, c + 1, color, obj)\n        dfs(r, c - 1, color, obj)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if (r, c) not in visited:\n                color = grid[r][c]\n                obj = []\n                dfs(r, c, color, obj)\n                if color not in objects:\n                    objects[color] = []\n                objects[color].append(obj)\n\n    return objects\n\ndef get_object_rows(objects):\n    \"\"\"\n    Extract unique rows occupied by objects, grouped by color.\n    \"\"\"\n    object_rows = {}\n    for color, color_objects in objects.items():\n        rows_set = set()\n        for obj in color_objects:\n            rows_set.update(r for r, _ in obj)\n        object_rows[color] = sorted(list(rows_set))\n    return object_rows\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid into a smaller output grid by identifying and\n    representing prominent object rows.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    objects = get_objects(input_grid)\n    object_rows = get_object_rows(objects)\n\n    # Determine the output grid dimensions based on the most prominent rows.\n    # This strategy prioritizes colors with the most distinct rows occupied.\n\n    # Get heights of objects.\n    heights = []\n    for color, color_objects in objects.items():\n      for obj in color_objects:\n        rs = [r for r, _ in obj]\n        heights.append(max(rs) - min(rs) + 1)\n\n    output_height = min(len(input_grid), max(heights))  # Limit output height\n    output_width = min(len(input_grid[0]), max([len(objs) for objs in objects.values()])) #Limit output width\n\n    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)\n\n    # Build the output grid.
