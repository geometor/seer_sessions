            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe current code attempts to identify objects and sample rows based on object heights. However, it's clear from the results that this approach is fundamentally flawed. The outputs are mostly incorrect in terms of size, color, and pixel arrangement. The core issue is that the code doesn't correctly capture the relationship between the input and output grids. It seems to be attempting a form of downsampling or object extraction, but the logic is incorrect. The strategy needs to shift from simple row sampling to identifying a more complex spatial or object-based transformation rule. It's critical to not assume a fixed output size or a direct correspondence between input and output rows.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Assumptions:** Discard the initial assumption that the output is created by simply sampling rows. The transformation is more complex.\n2.  **Focus on Spatial Relationships:** Analyze the spatial relationships between objects in the input and output.  Are objects being combined, split, re-colored, or moved in a predictable way?\n3.  **Object Properties:** Carefully examine object properties (size, color, position, bounding box) and how they relate to the output.\n4.  **Consider Sub-Grids:** Explore the possibility that the input grid is divided into sub-grids, and the transformation operates on these sub-grids independently.\n5. **Look for patterns that were not obvious**: Examine the failed cases to consider that the rule involves more than just object extraction - e.g. object interactions or counts.\n6.  **Iterative Refinement:** Develop a new natural language program and code based on the updated observations. Test and refine iteratively.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nI'll use Python code to analyze the provided examples and extract relevant metrics. Since I can't directly execute code here, I'll describe the code and the expected metrics.\n\n"
