"""
The input grid is conceptually divided into irregular objects of the same color. 
A smaller rectangular output grid is created by sampling specific rows from these
objects within the input grid. The precise mechanism for selecting which 
rows/columns to sample is not immediately obvious, but it appears to involve
some form of identification of prominent horizontal or vertical features 
within the input, possibly relating to the dimensions of the largest objects
or a combination of object features.
