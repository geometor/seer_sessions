Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution and strategize for improvement.

**General Assessment:**

The code aims to identify and replace all red (color 2) objects with white (color 0). The provided examples reveal inconsistencies in how the code handles red objects, especially when they are adjacent to or surrounded by other colors. The existing code uses a depth-first search (DFS) to find contiguous objects of the same color. It seems that in some cases, not all of the connected red pixels have been correctly changed.

**Strategy:**
1. **Analyze Object Identification:**  Closely examine how the `find_object` function identifies objects. It is critical to verify whether it accurately groups all connected pixels of the same color. The errors suggest that it might have premature termination when finding the red objects in more complex shapes.
2. **Review Edge Cases:** Pay close attention to red objects that touch other objects or the grid boundaries. There are errors, and adjacency may be causing an issue.
3. Verify the change to white occurs if and only if the original object was red.

**Metrics Gathering and Analysis:**

I'll now collect additional metrics using `tool_code` to better understand the errors. I want to check if any red pixels remain in the output and the properties of the errors themselves.
