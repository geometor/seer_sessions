facts:
  - observation: |
      Grids are 2D arrays of integers representing colors.
  - object_types:
      - name: pixel
        properties:
          - color: integer (0-9)
          - position: (row, column)
      - name: object # added description
        properties:
          - color: integer (0-9)
          - pixels: list of pixel positions
  - actions:
      - name: replace_color
        description: |
          Changes the color of a pixel or an object.
        parameters:
          - target: pixel or object
          - new_color: integer
  - relationships:
    - type: adjacency
      description: |
          Pixels are considered adjacent if they share a side or a corner.
  - transformation_context:
      - description: |
          The transformation focuses on replacing specific colors/objects with '0' (white) under certain adjacency conditions
      - conditions:

          -  color 2 (red) is being replaced by 0 (white).
