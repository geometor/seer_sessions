The dominant color is '4' (yellow), with other colors appearing in smaller, seemingly significant clusters.  There's a strong sense of \"objectness\" - contiguous blocks of the same color seem to be treated as units.  The transformation appears to selectively replace certain colors/objects with '0' (white) based on their context and neighbors. Specifically color 2 (red) appears to get replaced by 0 (white).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
