However, it's clear that both steps are based on overly simplistic assumptions and hardcoded values specific to the first two training examples. The code fails to generalize, as evidenced by the incorrect transformations on both examples. The strategy needs to shift from hardcoding to identifying underlying patterns and rules that govern the subgrid selection and color mapping.\n\n**Strategy**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine where the transformed output differs from the expected output in each example. This will pinpoint specific areas where the logic is flawed.\n2.  **Re-evaluate Subgrid Selection:** The current subgrid selection is arbitrary. We need to find a consistent rule, possibly based on object detection (contiguous regions of the same color), color patterns, or relative positions within the grid.\n3.  **Refine Color Filtering:** The color filtering rule is also too specific. We need to identify a more general rule, perhaps based on the relationship between colors in the input and output subgrids.\n4. **Iterate and test**: use each example pair to develop observations, create a\n   theory and adjust the logic, and test against the next example\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Initial)**\nHere is a breakdown of the examples and their current results, including a proposed object analyses based on visual inspection. We will refine this with metric gathering via code execution in a follow on step.\n\n**Example 1**\n\n*   **Input:** 30x30 grid with various colors.\n*   **Expected Output:** 5x5 grid, primarily black (0) with a magenta (6) row and some red (2) pixels.\n*   **Transformed Output:** 5x5 grid, but with incorrect pixel arrangement and colors.\n* **Objects and Observations**:\n\n    * Input: a 5x5 area of mixed colors exists at the top left\n    * Output: contains many of the colors from that 5x5 area\n\n**Example 2**\n\n*   **Input:** 30x30 grid with various colors.\n*   **Expected Output:** 4x4 grid, mix of black (0) and red (2).\n*   **Transformed Output:** 4x4 grid, but with incorrect pixel arrangement and colors.\n* **Objects and Observations**:\n\n    * Input: a 4x4 area of mixed colors exists at the top left\n    * Output: contains many of the colors from that 4x4 area, but not all\n\n**YAML Fact Identification**\n"

The dimensions of the subgrid appears correlated to the size of an area of many colors in the top left. The dimensions appear to be 5x5 if the top-left pixel is color 1, and 4x4 if color 4.\n2.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the identified subgrid.\n3.  **Filter Colors:**\n    *   Within the extracted subgrid:\n        *   If the subgrid is size 5x5, replace all colors other than 2 (red) with 0 (black). If the first row is all black, change it all to 6 (magenta).\n        *   If the subgrid is size 4x4, replace all colors other than 2 (red) with 0 (black)\n\n**Next Steps**\n\n1.  Use python tool execution to more accurately count pixels and compare\n    arrays.\n2.  Improve the subgrid selection by iterating through the examples, looking for\n    objects.\n3.  Generalize the color filtering rules. The current rules are very specific to the first and second training examples.\n"
