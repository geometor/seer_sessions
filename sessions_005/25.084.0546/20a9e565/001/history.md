Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The tasks involve grids of varying sizes, filled with single-digit integers representing colors.  The input grids are significantly larger than the output grids. The output grids seem to be derived from patterns or specific objects within the input grids. There's a strong sense of objectness, with contiguous blocks of the same color likely representing individual objects. The transformation appears to involve selecting and/or reducing specific colored regions based on either shape, and relative position.

**YAML Fact Block:**

      - type: transformed_to
        description: |

```


**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a breakdown of the transformation rule based on the three examples, expressed as a natural language program:

1.  **Identify Target Regions:** Examine the input grid and identify specific colored regions that meet certain criteria. The criteria seem different in each example:
    *   **Example 1:** The output grid is based on a sub-grid of the color 2 (red) within an area delineated by other color regions including colors: 1(blue), 4(yellow), 5(gray).
    *   **Example 2:** The output appears to be a simplified, two-column representation of adjacent pairs, ordered top to bottom, left to right of repeating patterns of adjacent color regions in the input grid, except for the final gray(5).
    *   **Example 3:** Selects the largest contiguous block of color 7 (orange). Other blocks of 7 are present but smaller.

2.  **Reduce/Simplify:**
    *    Example 1: select an inner area withing the input region.
    *    Example 2: Extract the essential information about each region.
    *    Example 3: Selects a complete region that matches specific characteristics.

3.  **Construct Output Grid:**
    *   **Example 1:** Create a smaller rectangular grid based on the inner region.
    *   **Example 2:** Create a new grid of shape n x 2, where *n* is the number of identified repeating pair regions, excluding those with color 0 (white). The order matters.
    *   **Example 3:** Creates a grid of the exact size of the selected region.

4. **Reposition** The transformation places the extracted or processed regions.

**Overall Summary**

The natural language program identifies one or more colored regions based on
their properties (color, shape, relative position), and creates a new grid based
on either a simplified representation of the region or a region that matches
specific characteristics.
