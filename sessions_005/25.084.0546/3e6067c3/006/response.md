Okay, let's analyze the provided information and formulate a strategy to improve the transformation logic.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The current code has several issues, as evidenced by the mismatches in all three test examples. The primary problems seem to stem from:

1.  **Incorrect Horizontal Extension:** The extension logic appears to be too aggressive, extending objects beyond the intended boundaries. It extends to *any* adjacent background pixel and in all rows, not just those with objects meeting the criteria.
2.  **Faulty Conditional Disappearance:** The logic for removing objects on the subsequent row doesn't correctly identify corresponding objects. It seems to have issues with spans and might be removing or filling incorrectly.
3. **Last Row Rule issue:** The logic to check for colors matching horizontal spans greater than 1 is overly complex, it should apply the check only for objects within the current row. Also, the provided check applies to colors of *any* objects, and replaces that in the final row. This is not always correct.
4.  **Object Definition Issue:** The object definition allows diagonal connections, which may not always be intended. It might cause adjacent, but conceptually separate, objects to be considered as one.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Object Definition:** Investigate if diagonal connections should be considered as part of the object. If we restrict the object definition, we should obtain more accurate span information.
2.  **Constrain Horizontal Extension**: Limit the extension, possibly making it conditional on object properties, not just on the row. Restrict it one pixel at a time and only to the *immediate* left or right.
3.  **Correct Conditional Disappearance:** Rethink how corresponding objects are identified on subsequent rows. Ensure the logic accounts for color, span, and position correctly.
4. **Simplify and Correct Last Row Rule:** Make the logic simpler for the last row transformation.
5. **Iterate and Validate:** After each modification, we'll need to re-run the code on the examples and check the results, updating metrics, facts, and descriptions as needed.

**Gather Metrics**

Let's examine the specific input, expected output, and transformed output grids to pinpoint exactly where the code is failing. We'll use python tool use.
