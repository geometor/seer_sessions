Consider pixels adjacent horizontally, vertically, *and diagonally* as part of the same object. The background color is 8.\n2.  **Horizontal Extension:** If an object of a given color spans more than one pixel *horizontally* within its row, extend that color horizontally to any adjacent background (color 8) pixels within that row.\n3.  **Disappearing Objects:**\n    *   Examine each row sequentially, from top to bottom.\n    *   If an object exists on row *N*, check if an object of the *same color* exists on row *N+1*.\n    *   If no object of the same color exists on row *N+1*, then on row *N+1* create a new object of color '8' (background) with the same horizontal span and x,y coordinates as the object from row *N*.\n4.  **Last Row Preservation/Modification**:\n    * The last row of the input is generally copied to the output.\n    * However, if any color in the last row also forms a multi-pixel object *anywhere* in the input grid, then those pixels in last row should change to color 8 (background)\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds contiguous objects of the same color in a grid, including diagonals.\"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    def dfs(row, col, color, obj):\n        if (row, col) in visited or not (0 <= row < rows and 0 <= col < cols) or grid[row, col] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((row, col))\n        obj.append((row, col))\n        # Check all 8 neighbors\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                    continue\n                dfs(row + dr, col + dc, color, obj)\n\n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n            if (row, col) not in visited and grid[row, col] != 8:\n                obj = []\n                dfs(row, col, grid[row, col], obj)\n                objects.append((grid[row, col], obj))  # Store color and object pixels\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the observed rules.\"\"\"\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    objects = find_objects(input_grid)\n\n    # Horizontal Extension\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for color, obj_pixels in objects:\n            row_pixels = [c for row, c in obj_pixels if row == r]\n            if len(row_pixels) > 1:  # More than one pixel of this color in this row\n                for c in range(cols):\n                  if output_grid[r,c] == 8:\n                    for pixel_r, pixel_c in obj_pixels:\n                        if pixel_r == r and abs(pixel_c - c) == 1: #adjacent\n                          output_grid[r,c] = color\n                          break\n\n\n    # Disappearing Objects\n    for r in range(rows - 1):  # Iterate up to the second-to-last row\n        for color, obj_pixels in objects:\n            current_row_exists = any(row == r for row, _ in obj_pixels)\n            next_row_exists = any(row == r + 1 for row, _ in obj_pixels)\n\n            if current_row_exists and not next_row_exists:\n                # Get horizontal span of object on current row\n                cols_in_obj = sorted([col for row, col in obj_pixels if row == r])\n                min_col = min(cols_in_obj)\n                max_col = max(cols_in_obj)\n\n                # Fill the corresponding region on the next row with 8\n                for c in range(min_col, max_col + 1):\n                    output_grid[r + 1, c] = 8\n\n    # Last Row Modification\n    last_row = rows - 1\n    for c in range(cols):\n        color = output_grid[last_row, c]\n        if color != 8:\n            # Check if this color exists as a multi-pixel object anywhere\n            for other_color, other_obj_pixels in objects:\n                if other_color == color:\n                    coords = [ (r,c) for r,c in other_obj_pixels]\n                    rows_with_color = [r for r, _ in coords ]\n                    if len(rows_with_color) > 0 :\n                        row_count = 0;\n                        for rr in rows_with_color:\n                            if rr == rows_with_color[0]:\n                                row_count+=1\n                        if row_count > 1: # there is more than one pixel in any given row\n                            output_grid[last_row, c] = 8\n                            break\n\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
