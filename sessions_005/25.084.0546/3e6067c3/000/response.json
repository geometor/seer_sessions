These contiguous blocks of the same color can be considered \"objects.\"\n*   **Colors:** Multiple colors are present within the objects (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 6, 4).\n* **Background Changes:** There are regions that change from backgroud to a non-background color, and vice-versa.\n*   **Object Changes:** Some colored regions appear to be duplicated or have their colors replicated to adjacent background pixels.\n*    **Object modification:** There are colors within objects that gets expanded to the background.\n*   **Consistent Rows:** Most of the rows with all '8's remain unchanged.\n*   **Exceptional Rows:** There's a single row at the bottom of each example that contains single instances of digits 2-9 that consistently remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
