observations:
  - example: 1
    objects:
      - color: 0  # white
        changed_to: 4 # yellow
        context: "adjacent to 4 or 5"
      - color: 4 # yellow
        changed_to: 0
        context: "adjacent to 7 or 5"
  - example: 2
    objects:
      - color: 0
        changed_to: 4
        context: "adjacent to 4 or 5"
      - color: 4
        changed_to: 0
        context: "adjacent to 0 or 5"
  - example: 3
    objects:
      - color: 0
        changed_to: 4
        context: "adjacent to 4"
      - color: 4
        changed_to: 0
        context: "adjacent to 0 or 5"
  - summary: |
        The transformation rule swaps 0 and 4 based on adjacent colors
        It's a toggle, not simply a replace action
