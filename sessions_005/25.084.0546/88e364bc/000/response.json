Specifically, there are a lot of gray (5) and orange (4)\n* **Background**: There are many white (0) pixels, which suggests they do not play an active role in the transformation\n* **Changes**: Visual inspection shows most of the input stays the same in the output with some exceptions.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
