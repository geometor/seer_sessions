facts:
  - object: background
    color: azure (8)
    role: static, provides context

  - object: input_signal_1
    color: blue (1)
    role: dynamic, potentially triggers transformation

  - object: input_signal_2
     color: green(3)
     role: dynamic, potentially triggers transformation

  - object: input_signal_3
     color: yellow(4)
     role: dynamic, potentially triggers transformation

  - object: target
    color: red (2)
    role: dynamic, undergoes transformation

  - transformation: replication
    description: The 'target' object is replicated based on the layout, count, and color of the input signal.
    details: Specifically, it looks like colored objects in the input are replaced in
             the output with red(2) pixels of equivalent size.
