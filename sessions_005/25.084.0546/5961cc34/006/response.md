Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The code fails to correctly transform the input grids in all four examples. The primary issue is that the code transforms *all* non-red objects to red and *then* expands the red outwards. It seems like the expansion should happen *before* other non-red objects are colored, or perhaps some objects aren't mean to be turned red at all. The expansion fills the entire grid with red in all cases, instead of stopping when it encounters other, originally non-red objects. The examples show that only the azure background is converted to red by expansion, not other colored objects.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Object Interactions:** Carefully examine how red interacts with other colors in the correct output. Determine if only azure pixels next to red pixels are replaced, and if other colored objects act as barriers.
2.  **Refine Expansion Logic:** Modify the natural language program (and subsequently the code) to correctly handle the expansion, respecting existing non-azure, non-red objects.

**Gather Metrics and Verify Assumptions:**

First, I'd like to write small function to help analyze the grids.
