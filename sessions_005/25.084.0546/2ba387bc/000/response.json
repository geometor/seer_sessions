The most obvious change is that the output grids are smaller (fewer rows and columns) than the input grids. Within the smaller grids, the colored blocks from the input are rearranged. It seems like the transformation extracts and rearranges colored rectangles, and stacks them. It also appears there's a consistent pattern in how the rectangles are ordered and how the background (white '0' pixels) is handled. It's clear that adjacency and contiguity are vital as the program identifies contiguous blocks of the same colour.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"

A rectangle is defined as a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.\n2.  **Extract Rectangles:** For each identified rectangle, extract its pixel data, noting its original color, width, and height. The order of the extracted rectangles will be important.\n3.  **Determine Output Grid Size**: Determine the width as the width of the rectangles in one stacked group. Determine height as double the number of rectangles in one stacked group.\n4.  **Reorder Rectangles**: Group extracted rectangles by a repeating width pattern.\n5. **Create output stack**: For each group, create a stack of the rectangles, 4 high, and put adjacent 0 pixels together.\n6.  **Stack Order**: The rectangles should be placed in order that they appear.\n7. **Create final output**: Place the stack next to each other.\n\n"
