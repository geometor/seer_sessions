A consistent feature across both examples is a horizontal line of '1' (blue) pixels near the middle. There are colored objects (contiguous blocks of the same color) above and below this line. The transformation seems to involve a complex mirroring or reflection of some of these objects, potentially with some color changes and spatial rearrangements, across the blue line '1'. Some of the color of the single pixels is changed.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
