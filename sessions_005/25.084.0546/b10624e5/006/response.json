            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy to refine the natural language program and address the identified errors:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe current code implements a mirroring operation based on a horizontal blue line. It correctly identifies objects and attempts to mirror them across this line, with some color-specific rules. However, the results show significant discrepancies, especially in pixel matching and color counts. This indicates issues in several areas:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Mirroring Logic:** The core mirroring logic seems flawed. The code mirrors based on distance to the blue line, but the shifting behavior (particularly for green objects) and the handling of multiple objects of the same color are not entirely correct. The mirroring logic should be re-evaluated with a focus on the relative positions of the objects.\n\n2.  **Incomplete Color Rules:** The color transformations aren't fully capturing the task's rules. Specifically the relationship between color 9 and the placement of colors 2.\n\n3. **Object Identification is correct.** The objects are being extracted from the scene correctly.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Precise Mirroring:** Refine the mirroring algorithm. Instead of simple distance-based mirroring, explicitly map the coordinates of each pixel in an object above the blue line to its corresponding mirrored position below the line (and vice-versa).\n\n2.  **Conditional Color and Position Changes:** Implement color and position changes as conditional rules *after* the general mirroring. This clarifies the sequence of operations.\n\n3.  **Iterative Testing:** Test the updated code *after each change*. This is crucial for isolating the impact of individual modifications.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis**\n\nHere, a manual analysis will be made and the code execution block below will be used to validate my assumptions.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   The blue line is correctly identified.\n    *   Objects are mirrored (8s, 2s, 3s).\n    *   The green (3) object is shifted down by one pixel on the mirrored side.\n    *    The color 9 (maroon) object does not appear to have been detected as an object - and should be mirrored.\n    *   The red (2) object is correctly mirrored\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   The blue line is correctly identified.\n     *  The 3 is correctly mirrored across the blue line, but there is a problem with the green shift.\n     * The 9 should become an additional column of 2s above and below.\n\n"
