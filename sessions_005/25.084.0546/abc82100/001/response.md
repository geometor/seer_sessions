"""
Transforms an input grid into an output grid based on a set of color-swapping rules.
The rules are derived from analyzing the provided examples and identifying consistent color
transformations.
The primary rule is to swap colors in pairs like (1,2), (4,2) and (6,7), and
apply some transformations to 8 based on neighbors.
