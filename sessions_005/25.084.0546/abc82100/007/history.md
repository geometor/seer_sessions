"""
Transforms an input grid into an output grid based on a combination of color swaps,
positional rules, and neighbor interactions.  The current rules include:

- Color 2 always becomes color 1.
- Color 6 always becomes color 7.
- Color 7 always becomes color 6.
- Color 1 becomes color 2 if it is adjacent to a pixel of color 2; otherwise, it becomes 0 (with exceptions).
- Color 8 generally becomes color 0, with exceptions related to neighboring 1s.
- Color 4 has positional rules, particularly at grid edges, turning into color 2.
- Color 0 remains color 0.

Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code captures some basic color swaps (2 -> 1, 6 -> 7, 7 -> 6) but fails to accurately model the more complex conditional transformations, especially those involving spatial relationships and object interactions. The rules for colors 1, 4, and 8 are particularly problematic. The strategy will involve refining these rules by:

1.  **Focusing on object boundaries:** Instead of just checking for adjacent colors, we need to identify the boundaries of contiguous color regions (objects).
2.  **Refining positional rules:** The current positional rules for color 4 are too broad and specific to example 3. We need more generalizable positional or contextual rules.
3.  **Re-evaluating the rule for 8:** The current rule for 8 is a placeholder and needs to based on concrete observations that occur in all examples.
4.  **Addressing Color 1 transformations correctly** There is complex context for when a 1 should change to a 2 or a 0.

**Metrics and Observations (per example):**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including a more detailed analysis:

*Example 1*

*   **Input:** 5x5 grid with colors 1, 2, 8, and 0.
*   **Expected Output:** Shows '2's forming a diagonal line where the '1's and '8' were.
*   **Observed Output:** The 2 -> 1 swap worked, but the 1 -> 2 and 8 -> 0 transformations did not.
*  **Key Issue**: logic error for handling transitions from 1 to 2 and 8 to 0

*Example 2*

*   **Input:** 15x15 grid with a variety of colors (0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8).
*   **Expected Output:** Complex pattern changes, including color swaps and positional shifts.
*   **Observed Output:** Some color swaps (6 & 7) are correct, but other transformations are inaccurate, especially for colors 2, 4, and 8.
*  **Key Issue**: handling colors 2, 4, and 8, possibly involving positional or neighbor-based rules, is incorrect.

*Example 3*

*   **Input:** 20x20 grid, again with a variety of colors.
*   **Expected Output:** Shows a complex pattern, with 4s at the edges becoming 2s, and other intricate changes.
*   **Observed Output:** The positional rule for 4 (designed based on this example) works *only* for this specific case, and other transformations are incorrect.
*  **Key Issue**: Overfitting to this example; positional rules are too specific, need to relate the location of the 4s to other aspects of the grid.

*Example 4*

*   **Input:** 8x8 grid with 1s, 2s, and 8s.
*   **Expected Output**: 1s become 2s and all of the 8s are removed
*   **Observed Output:** Shows inconsistencies in the transformation of 1s and 8s.
*  **Key Issue**: The color transformations for '1' are incorrect when '1' is next to '2' and '8' is near '1'.

**YAML Facts:**

  - type: contiguous_region
    properties:
      color: int # 0-9
      shape: list # [rows, cols] of the bounding box
      position: list # [row, col] of the top-left corner

actions:
  - name: color_swap
    parameters:
      from_color: int
      to_color: int
    conditions:
      - "True"  # Always applies, but specific colors are hardcoded

  - name: conditional_color_change
    parameters:
      from_color: int
      to_color: int
    conditions:
      - adjacent_to_color: int # Check adjacency to a specific color
      - edge_position: string # "top", "bottom", "left", "right", or combinations
      - relative_position_x: string # relationship between x position of two objects, eq, lt, gt
      - relative_position_y: string

  - name: remove_object
     parameters:
        color: int
     conditions:
        - all  
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Color Swaps:**
    *   If a pixel is color 2, it becomes color 1.
    *   If a pixel is color 6, it becomes color 7.
    *   If a pixel is color 7, it becomes color 6.

2.  **Conditional Transformations:**
    *   If a pixel is color 1 AND is adjacent to a pixel of color 2, it becomes color 2.
        *   If a pixel is color 1 and is not adjacent to a pixel of color 2, it becomes color 0.
    *   If a pixel is color 4:
        *   If the pixel is on the top, bottom, left, or right edge of the *entire grid*, it becomes 2.
        *   If a pixel of color '4' is not located on the outer edge of the grid, it will retain its color.
    *   If a pixel is color 8, it becomes color 0.

3.  **Object Removal**
    *    Objects of color 8 are removed.

4.  **Default:**
    *   If a pixel is color 0, it remains color 0.

**Reasoning for changes:**

- The original color swap rules are correct and are kept.
- The rule for color 1 simplifies the adjacency requirement and creates consistent behavior based on proximity to color 2.
- The color 4 rule is *simplified* to apply only to grid edges, as this consistently explains the observed behavior in all of the training inputs *without* reference to overall grid dimensions, which is more general.
- The color 8 rule removes the adjacency to 1 because Example 3 shows that 8 can go away even next to 1.
- The "object removal" is really a consequence of the rule for color 8, making it explicit.

The next phase should focus on translating this revised natural language program into Python code and further iterating on the results.
