Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy to refine the transformation rules:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial approach of identifying uniform rectangular regions and applying color-based transformations is a reasonable starting point. However, the rules are clearly too simplistic and inconsistent across the examples. The "Pixels Off" metric highlights significant discrepancies between the transformed outputs and the expected outputs.

The core issue is that the rules are based on assumptions from the first example that don't generalize. We need to:

1.  **Identify Consistent Rules:** Look for transformation patterns that apply across *all* examples, not just one. This likely means abandoning the specific color-replacement rules (blue to black, red to gray, azure to green) tested so far.
2.  **Consider Object Relationships:** The current code only looks at rectangles in isolation.  We need to incorporate spatial relationships and potentially the context of surrounding pixels/objects. The ARC priors suggest paying attention to adjacency.
3.  **Refine Rectangle Modification:**  The "inside" and "border" modification attempts were ad-hoc. We need a more systematic way to determine *which* parts of a rectangle (if any) should be changed, and *how*.
4. **Consider Multiple Object Properties:** The existing rules don't seem consistent. It might be the relative size, rather than absolute color, which is relevant.

**Metrics and Observations (per example)**

To understand the examples better, I'll analyze them to find some useful properties of the rectangles involved.
