However, the test results reveal several issues:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Transformations:** The transformations applied, especially to red and azure rectangles, don't consistently match the expected outputs.\n2.  **Missed Transformations:** Some transformations present in the examples are not captured by the current rules (e.g., changes to green pixels in Example 3).\n3.  **Overly Specific Conditions:** The reliance on \"surrounded by\" conditions might be too restrictive and not general enough to capture the underlying logic.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the pixel differences between the transformed output and the expected output for each example. This will pinpoint the exact locations where the code fails.\n2.  **Identify Underlying Rules:** Instead of focusing solely on rectangles, look for more general patterns and relationships between pixels. Consider adjacency, relative positions, and color combinations.\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Re-formulate the transformation rules in a more precise and generalized way, capturing the core logic.\n4.  **Adjust Existing Functions, or create New Functions:** Based on the refined rules, create a helper python function to encapsulate the findings.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's use code execution to analyze the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example. We want to obtain a detailed report.\n\n"
