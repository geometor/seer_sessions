The transformation seems to selectively modify certain regions or objects within the grid, while leaving others untouched. There are repeated patterns, specifically rectangular blocks of the same color, which are sometimes altered and sometimes not. The alterations introduce variations in the color patterns within these rectangles and along their borders.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
