The results show the code fails to correctly transform all three examples. The primary issues are:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Duplication Logic for Alternating Rows:** The code duplicates the alternating rows and any adjacent solid-color rows, but the location and logic are flawed. It looks for *all* alternating rows in the input, rather than just the ones present at the beginning.\n2.  **Incorrect Duplication and insertion logic three-section pattern**: The code attempts to duplicate the row, but it duplicates and insert at the end, the row at the original position. This is not the case for all patterns\n3.   **Missing Context:** Example 3 introduces the case where rows are inserted multiple times.\n\nThe core strategy to fix this is:\n*   Refactor how pattern rows are identified, inserted and how offsets are handled.\n*   Iterate through input examples and apply refactoring.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (per example)**\n\nTo better understand the errors, let's collect some information about each example.\n\n"
