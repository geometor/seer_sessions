            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for updating the natural language program and code:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe current code focuses on identifying and duplicating specific rows: those with alternating color patterns or those fitting a \"three-section\" pattern (e.g., \"1 3 3 1 1 1 4 4 1\").  The duplication logic is example-specific, with separate handling for the alternating pattern and the three-section pattern. The primary issue is that the code *correctly* identifies the pattern rows but *incorrectly* duplicates and places them. It doesn't generalize the duplication and placement rules across all examples. The pixel-off count is significant in all examples, which suggests the placement rule is not being inferred from the data.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Pattern Identification:** The current pattern identification (`is_alternating`, `is_three_section_pattern`, `is_adjacent_to_alternating`) seems accurate in finding *which* rows are relevant, but the duplication/placement logic within `transform` is overly specific to the first training example and doesn't handle other cases. We need a more robust way to determine the relationship between identified rows and their placement in the output.\n\n2.  **Generalized Duplication/Placement:** Instead of hardcoding destination indices (like `destination_index = 10` in Example 3), we should determine the destination dynamically based on some properties of the pattern row or its relationship to other rows. The logic that handles adjacent rows also appears flawed based on the results, duplicating in instances when it's not supposed to.\n\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:**  We need to analyze *why* certain rows are duplicated and *where* they are placed in the output.  The current metrics show large errors.  We need to analyze the errors to inform changes.  We should revisit the natural language program and code after each example, refining the rules.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\nLet's gather specific metrics for each example:\n\n"
