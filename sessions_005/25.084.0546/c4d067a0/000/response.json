The most prominent feature is the replication of specific rows containing sequences of colored pixels, particularly rows with repeating patterns of azure (8), alternating colors, or solid blocks of color. There's a sense of \"object duplication\" or \"pattern propagation,\" where existing rows are copied and inserted into the grid, sometimes overwriting existing content. The trigger for this duplication seems to be the presence of specific color arrangements within a row.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1. **Scan** the input grid row by row.\n\n2. **Identify** \"pattern rows\". A pattern row is defined based on specific criteria which changes between different groups:\n   *  In examples 1 and 2, pattern rows are:\n      *   Rows containing alternating colors, such as `8 4 8 4` or `8 1 8 1`.\n      *  Rows containing color blocks, like `4 4 4` and `1 1 1`, adjacent to a sequence of alternating colors, like `8 4 8 4` and `8 1 8 1`.\n   * In example 3 a pattern row is a row starting and ending with 1's and which has 3 sections, first section is a combination of 1's and another color, second is solid 1's, third is 1's and another color, different from the first. For instance: `1 3 3 1 1 1 4 4 1`\n\n3. **Duplicate** the pattern row.\n\n4.  In examples 1 and 2, the duplication occurs *below* the original pattern row.\n    *  In example 1, the identified rows with colored pixels and their adjacent `8` color row containing blocks, are moved from row number 2 onwards, to row number 6.\n    * In example 2, this happens from row number 7 onwards.\n    * The identified sequence in Example 1 (alternating `8 x 8 x`, then a block of `x x x`) is duplicated. The pattern row containing repeating `1`s is overwritten by this duplicated pattern.\n    * The identified sequences in Example 2, located below the first identified section containing 2 colors and a repeated `1` section, are overwritten and replaced by their colored sections.\n\n5.  In example 3 the process in points 1 and 2 happens in reverse compared to examples 1 and 2.\n    * In example 3, rows are copied *above*, at a fixed offset determined by the position of the row, similar to example 1 and 2.\n    * The identified sequence (a row starting and ending with 1's, that can be divided into 3 colored sections) is duplicated and overwrites other instances of 1 repeated colors.\n\n6. **Preserve** all other rows in their original positions if they are not identified as pattern rows or are not subject to being overwritten.\n\nThe core concept is selective row duplication based on identified patterns, with the duplicated rows being inserted at specific locations, sometimes overwriting existing content. The key to solving this lies in correctly identifying the pattern recognition rule and the insertion logic, which seems to vary slightly between the examples. Specifically, the *direction* of the duplication (above or below) and the insertion *point* are critical. Also, the patterns considered valid differ from group to group.\n"
