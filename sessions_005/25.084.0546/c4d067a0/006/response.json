            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a strategy to improve the natural language program and the corresponding code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe code's current strategy focuses on identifying and duplicating specific row patterns: alternating color rows and \"three-section\" patterns. The results show significant discrepancies between the transformed outputs and the expected outputs in all three examples. This suggests a fundamental flaw in either the pattern identification, the duplication logic, or the insertion mechanism. The errors are not minor adjustments; they indicate a misunderstanding of the core transformation rule. Simply put, the code duplicates rows, but not the correct ones, and not necessarily in the correct locations. The description assumes only two specific row types exist and that they're the only ones that are ever duplicated.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Pattern Identification:** The definitions of \"alternating\" and \"three-section\" patterns might be too restrictive or incorrect. We need to carefully analyze the examples to confirm if these are the *only* patterns being manipulated and if the current definitions accurately capture them. Example 3 is particularly important, since rows that don't initially appear to be part of any pattern are added.\n2.  **Refine Duplication and Insertion Logic:** The current logic duplicates rows and inserts them immediately after the original or other identified patterns.  The placement and number of duplications are likely incorrect. We need to determine the rules governing *where* and *how many times* each pattern is duplicated. It's possible insertion isn't always adjacent.\n3.  **Consider Other Transformations:** The current code *only* considers row duplication. It's possible other transformations, such as pixel-level manipulations or column operations, are also involved, although the problem description and core priors suggest that the solution will be object-based at a larger scale.\n4. **Holistic view**: The code makes assumptions and generalizations based on the first example and attempts to apply them to subsequent. Need to step back and define the high level transformation.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**\n\nLet's gather some information about the patterns in each example using a modified version of the existing code for analysis. This is *not* the solution code, but a tool to understand the examples.\n\n"
