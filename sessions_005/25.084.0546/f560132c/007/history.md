Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Identify Objects: Find all contiguous regions (objects) of non-zero pixels in the input grid. Two pixels are considered part of the same object if they share a side (not just a corner).
2. Bounding Boxes: For each identified object, determine its bounding box. The bounding box is the smallest rectangle (defined by `min_row`, `min_col`, `max_row`, `max_col`) that completely encloses the object.
3. Color Mapping:  Map the original color of each object to a new color based on the following rules:
    *   Red (2) becomes Blue (1)
    *   Blue (1) remains Blue (1)
    * Gray (5) remains Gray (5)
    * Orange (7) becomes Gray (5)
    *   Azure (8) remains Azure (8)
    *   Maroon (9) remains Maroon (9)
    *   Yellow (4) becomes Maroon(9)
    *   Green (3) becomes Azure (8)
    *   If an object's color is not in this mapping, it is mapped to 0 (white)
4. Arrange Objects: Create an output grid by arranging bounding boxes of the objects. Objects are placed in rows. The total width of a row should not exceed 8. If the next object can fit, combine it by expanding the row height to fit and concatenating the object to the row, otherwise move to the next row.
5. Combine Rows - combine rows vertically to construct final output.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
Okay, let's analyze the errors and refine the natural language program and the approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The errors "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()" in both examples 1 and 2 suggest a problem with conditional statements involving NumPy arrays. Specifically, the issue likely lies within the `if current_row.size > 0:` and similar checks within the `transform` function, especially after the concatenation operations. The `current_row` can be a numpy array, and comparing an array with > 0 gives another array. We should check if it's empty.

The core strategy to resolve these errors will involve:

1.  **Debugging the conditionals:** Carefully examine the `if` conditions related to `current_row` and replace ambiguous checks with appropriate NumPy functions like `np.any()`, `np.all()`, or, more appropriately `current_row.size != 0` or `current_row.shape[0] != 0` if checking existence, after concatenations and other operations that may result in multi-element arrays.
2.  **Reviewing array concatenation:** Ensure that row and column concatenations are performed correctly, handling potential shape mismatches, and particularly that empty rows/arrays are handled.

**Metrics Gathering and Analysis**

To better understand the state of `current_row` at the point of the error, I will add some print statements to the code and rerun it with the inputs. But, since I cannot currently modify the code directly, I will note exactly what I would inspect, which is, just before the offending `if` statement, what is:

- `current_row` itself
- `current_row.shape`
- `current_row.size`

These data points will help pinpoint the root cause related to the array dimensions/contents. Because of prior experience, and because I cannot execute code here to provide metrics, I will proceed directly to facts and the updated natural language program.

**YAML Fact Documentation**


```yaml
facts:
  - task_id: "Example Task"
  - observations: |
      The transformation involves identifying objects within the input grid,
      recoloring them based on a predefined mapping, and arranging them into
      a new grid. The arrangement follows a row-wise packing strategy, where
      each row has a maximum width of 8. Objects are placed in rows, and rows are
      stacked vertically. The error lies in how empty rows are checked.
  - object_identification: |
      Objects are contiguous regions of non-zero pixels of the same color.
      Adjacency is defined by sharing a side (not just a corner).
  - object_properties:
      - color: Original color of the object in the input grid.
      - bounding_box: Smallest rectangle enclosing the object (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
      - mapped_color: New color assigned based on the color_map.
      - width: width of bounding box.
      - height: height of bounding box
  - actions:
      - identify: Find all objects in the input grid.
      - map_color: Change the color of each object based on the color mapping.
      - arrange: Place objects into rows, with a maximum row width of 8.
      - combine_rows: Stack rows vertically to create the final output.
  - error_analysis: |
      The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" occurs
      because of incorrect conditional checks on NumPy arrays, specifically when checking if
      'current_row' is empty or not using 'if current_row.size > 0'.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of non-zero pixels in the input grid. Two pixels are considered part of the same object if they share a side (not just a corner).

2.  **Bounding Boxes:** For each identified object, determine its bounding box. The bounding box is the smallest rectangle (defined by `min_row`, `min_col`, `max_row`, `max_col`) that completely encloses the object.

3.  **Color Mapping:** Map the original color of each object to a new color based on the following rules:
    *   Red (2) becomes Blue (1)
    *   Blue (1) remains Blue (1)
    *   Gray (5) remains Gray (5)
    *   Orange (7) becomes Gray (5)
    *   Azure (8) remains Azure (8)
    *   Maroon (9) remains Maroon (9)
    *   Yellow (4) becomes Maroon(9)
    *   Green (3) becomes Azure (8)
    *   If an object's color is not in this mapping, it is mapped to 0 (white)

4.  **Arrange Objects:** Create an output grid by arranging the bounding boxes of the objects. Objects are placed in rows. The total width of a row should not exceed 8. If the next object can fit horizontally (current row width + object width <= 8), combine it with the current row by:
    *   Determine maximum height: Take the maximum of the current row height and new object's height.
    *   Pad rows: Pad the current row and new row with 0s to make sure that their heights are the same before concatenation.
    *   Concatenate horizontally.

    If the next object cannot fit horizontally, start a new row.

5.  **Combine Rows:** Combine rows vertically to construct the final output.

6. **Handle Empty Output:** If no objects were in input, return an empty grid.

7. **Empty Row Check:** Use `current_row.size != 0` to check if the current row is empty.
