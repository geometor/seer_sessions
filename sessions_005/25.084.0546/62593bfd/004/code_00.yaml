  - task_id: "a85d4709"
  - example_1:
    - observation: "Multiple objects of different colors (1, 2, 3, 4) are present in the input."
    - observation: "Objects are contiguous regions of non-0 and non-5 pixels."
    - observation: "Objects appear to be stacked vertically in the output."
    - observation: "The stacking order seems to be from the bottom row of the input to the top."
    - background_color: 0 # Determined from input, appears consistent
  - example_2:
    - observation: "Multiple objects of different colors (1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9) are present, some overlapping in terms of rows."
    - observation: "Objects are contiguous regions of non-5 pixels." # 5 is the background in this case.
    - observation: "The output stacks objects, preserving horizontal positions."
    - observation: "The code incorrectly stacked object 4 on top of object 2"
    - background_color: 5 # Determined from the most frequent color
  - general:
      - observation: "The background color can differ between inputs of the same task. It is the most frequent color."
      - observation: "Within a row band occupied by an object, the original relative column positions of pixels within that object are maintained."
      - observation: "Objects are placed to fill available spaces within their original row boundaries, as long as they respect the order from the input."
