Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.  The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement or filtering of colored objects within the grid, maintaining the relative position of some. There's a sense of object permanence.  Colors appear and disappear, and objects are transposed, mirrored or inverted, but those changes appear based on regular rules.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task_description:
  task_type: Rearrangement and Filtering
  grid_dimensions: Identical input and output
  colors:
    present: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9]
    mapping: {0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 3: green, 4: yellow, 5: gray, 7: orange, 9: maroon}
  objects:
    - description: Groups of contiguous pixels of the same color.
      properties:
        color: Integer value (0-9)
        shape: Determined by contiguous pixels
        position: (row, column) of each pixel
  actions:
      - name: Transpose, mirror or invert
        description: Move selected objects to the transposed/mirrored/inverted position in the output grid
        parameters:
        - selection_criteria: Objects with colors other than gray (5) are selected

  relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description: Relative positions of objects are mostly maintained, except for the inversion.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color in the input grid. Consider each of these blocks as a single object.
2.  **Selection:** Select only the colors that are not the background, considered as gray (5).
3.  **Transpose, Mirror, or Invert:** Within each grid, there are distinct colored objects. These objects appear to be selected and transposed or mirrored/inverted. In the first example, it's mirrored/inverted, whereas it's transposed in the second one.
4. **Background insertion:** Insert all of the "background" colored pixels, the grey (5) in the locations where there are no other colors.

In simpler terms, the transformation inverts/transposes/mirrors the position of the colored object.
