```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous clusters of non-zero pixels. Each cluster is an object, and pixels of the same color within an object are considered parts of it.

2.  **Iterate through Columns:** Examine the grid column by column, starting from the rightmost column and moving towards the left.

3.  **Determine Shift Potential:** Within each column, determine the objects that are eligible for shifting.
    *   Objects are shifted if they are not in the leftmost column.
    *   The direction of the shift (left or right) depends on where it is blocked by another object.
    *   Consider the grid edge as a blocking object.

4.  **Shift Objects:** Shift each object to the left or right by one or more columns.
   * if any part of an object would collide with a non-zero pixel of another object, the moving object stops immediately before the collision.

5. **Join and Coalesce Objects**: After an object is moved, if parts of another object of the same color exist that are adjacent, combine them.

6. **Vertical Alignment**: objects shift down to the lowest row of a blocking object

7.  **Preserve Background:**  The background (pixels with value 0) is preserved unless overwritten by a shifted object.

Train Set Results:

## Example 5:
Error: index 9 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 9
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, the errors, and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The code has multiple issues, revealed by running it against the training examples. The errors point to problems with:

1.  **Index Out of Bounds:** The code is attempting to access rows or columns that don't exist within the grid. This likely stems from incorrect shift calculations or assumptions about grid dimensions during the vertical alignment.
2.  **Maximum Recursion Depth:** This indicates that the `coalesce_clusters` function is calling itself repeatedly without reaching a base case to stop the recursion. This happens when clusters are repeatedly merged, and the function keeps finding new adjacent clusters to combine.
3. shift\_cluster is not dropping objects to the lowest possible row.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Debugging Index Errors:**
    *   Carefully review `vertically_align_cluster`, and `shift_cluster`. Add checks to ensure that calculated indices (row and column) always remain within the valid bounds of the grid.
    *   Print intermediate grid states within these functions to pinpoint exactly where the out-of-bounds access occurs.

2.  **Fixing Recursion in `coalesce_clusters`:**
    *   The current recursive approach is flawed. A better strategy is to use a loop and iterate until no more coalescing is possible. This can be determined by checking if any changes were made during an iteration.
    *   Another potential fix is to modify the `find_clusters` function to only return unique, already-coalesced clusters.

3. **Improve shift\_cluster logic:**
    * combine the vertical and horizontal shifts, and check for collisions

**Gathering Metrics and Example Analysis (using code execution):**

To understand the failures better, let's examine each example's input/output shapes, colors, and the specific error encountered.

facts:
  - task: "Shift and coalesce objects horizontally and vertically."
  - objects: "Contiguous non-zero pixels of the same color."
  - properties:
      color: "Integer value (0-9) representing a color."
      position: "(row, column) coordinates within the grid."
      shape: "Determined by the arrangement of contiguous pixels."
  - actions:
      shift_horizontal: "Move object left or right by one column, stopping at grid edges or other objects."
      shift_vertical: "Move an object down as many rows as possible, stopping at grid edge or other objects."
      coalesce: "Combine adjacent objects of the same color into a single object."
  - constraints:
      horizontal_movement: "Objects can only move one column at a time and stop if there is another object in it's path"
      vertical_movement: "Objects always move downwards to the maximum possible extent within grid bounds and blocked by other objects"
      coalescing: "Only occurs between objects of the same color that are adjacent (including diagonally)."
      color_consistency: "The color of an object remains constant during shifting and coalescing."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Object Identification:** Identify all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is defined as a group of one or more contiguous pixels of the same non-zero color.

2.  **Horizontal Shifting:** Iterate through the grid column by column, starting from the rightmost column (index `grid.shape[1] - 1`) and moving left (decrementing column index).
    *   For each column, identify all objects present.
    *   Attempt to shift each identified object one column to the left. A shift is successful if:
        *   The new position of every pixel in the object is within the grid boundaries.
        *   The new position of every pixel in the object does not overlap with a pixel belonging to a *different* object (non-zero and not part of the current object).
    *   If a leftward shift is not possible, attempt to shift the object one column to the right, following the same conditions as above.

3.  **Vertical Shifting (Gravity):** After horizontal shifts are completed, iterate through all identified objects. For each object:
    * Determine the maximum possible downward shift. This is the smallest distance (in rows) to either the bottom of the grid or to the topmost pixel of another object directly below any part of the current object.
    * Move the object down by this calculated number of rows.

4.  **Coalescing:** After vertical shifting, merge any adjacent objects of the same color. Iterate:
      * Find all the distinct clusters.
      * Combine any clusters that are of the same color and have pixels that are directly or diagonally adjacent.
      * Repeat finding and combining, until no more combines are possible.

5. **Output:** The final, transformed grid is the result of these operations.
