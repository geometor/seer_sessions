actions:
  - type: shift  # General shift, could be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal
    conditions:
      - "Objects move as a unit."
      - "Movement may be blocked by other objects or grid boundaries."
  - type: coalesce
    conditions:
      - "Objects of the same color merge when adjacent."
      - "Adjacency includes diagonals."
  - type: shape_change # added this - since we don't know
    conditions:
        - "objects may change shape"
