facts:
  - task: "Shift and coalesce objects horizontally and vertically."
  - objects: "Contiguous non-zero pixels of the same color."
  - properties:
      color: "Integer value (0-9) representing a color."
      position: "(row, column) coordinates within the grid."
      shape: "Determined by the arrangement of contiguous pixels."
  - actions:
      shift_horizontal: "Move object left or right by one column, stopping at grid edges or other objects."
      shift_vertical: "Move an object down as many rows as possible, stopping at grid edge or other objects."
      coalesce: "Combine adjacent objects of the same color into a single object."
  - constraints:
      horizontal_movement: "Objects can only move one column at a time and stop if there is another object in it's path"
      vertical_movement: "Objects always move downwards to the maximum possible extent within grid bounds and blocked by other objects"
      coalescing: "Only occurs between objects of the same color that are adjacent (including diagonally)."
      color_consistency: "The color of an object remains constant during shifting and coalescing."
