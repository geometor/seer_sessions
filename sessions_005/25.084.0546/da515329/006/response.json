The code correctly identifies azure pixels as seeds for expansion but needs a more refined algorithm to control the expansion's direction, extent, and conditions.  The key is to recognize that the expansion isn't simply \"neighboring,\" but has a precise geometric relationship governed by rows and columns, often skipping cells.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Pattern:** Carefully examine the input/output pairs, especially where the previous code failed. The goal is to find a precise geometric rule, not just a general \"expansion.\" Look for patterns in rows and columns, symmetries, and distances.\n\n2.  **Controlled Expansion:** Instead of a simple flood fill (iterating over all neighbors), implement a rule that selectively expands based on the observed geometric pattern.  This might involve expanding only in specific directions, skipping certain cells, or having a maximum expansion distance that depends on the row/column.\n\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:**  Test the updated rule after each change. Don't try to solve everything at once. Start with the simplest example and progressively generalize.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nI'll use manual observation here.  The code execution environment is not conducive to visual grid manipulation, and the core issue is pattern recognition, not computation.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input has a small cluster of azure pixels.\n    *   Output shows an intricate pattern of azure and white, extending beyond the immediate neighbors.  It has diagonal elements and seems to \"skip\" over some white cells.\n    *   The previous code greatly over-expanded, filling almost the entire grid with azure.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input has a single vertical line of azure pixels, interrupted by a horizontal line of azure and other colored pixels.\n    *   Output shows a complex pattern. Note how expansion appears to \"wrap\" around the grid in some cases.\n    *   The previous code again over-expanded, not respecting the complex, wrapping pattern.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input has a central \"cross\" of azure pixels.\n    *   Output exhibits a similar alternating pattern, with expansions following diagonal lines.\n    *   The over-expansion is evident.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
