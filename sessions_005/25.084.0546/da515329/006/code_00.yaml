        Identify "seed" pixels (value 8 in input).
        Expand these seeds outwards based on a geometric pattern,
        replacing white (0) pixels with azure (8).
        The pattern is not a simple flood fill.  It appears to have
        diagonal components and may involve skipping some white cells. The expansion appears to respect and possibly wrap around the grid edges.
