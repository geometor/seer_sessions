The expansion is not a simple flood fill; it follows specific directional and alternating patterns.  The code needs to identify seed pixels (8 in the input) and then expand them according to a set of rules that consider direction and potentially distance from the seed. The previous attempt expanded too aggressively in all directions. This version will implement a controlled, directional expansion.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_direct_neighbors(grid, row, col):\n    \"\"\"Gets the direct neighbors (up, down, left, right) of a cell.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    for i, j in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n        neighbor_row, neighbor_col = row + i, col + j\n        if 0 <= neighbor_row < rows and 0 <= neighbor_col < cols:\n            neighbors.append((neighbor_row, neighbor_col))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the expansion rules.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate a fixed number of times, representing expansion steps.
