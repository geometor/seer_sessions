"""
The transformation involves expanding azure (8) pixels in the input grid to neighboring white (0) pixels in the output grid. The expansion is not a simple flood fill; it follows specific directional and alternating patterns.  The code needs to identify seed pixels (8 in the input) and then expand them according to a set of rules that consider direction and potentially distance from the seed. The previous attempt expanded too aggressively in all directions. This version will implement a controlled, directional expansion.
