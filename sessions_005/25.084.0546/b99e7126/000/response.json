The most frequent colors are white (0), blue(1), red(2), green(3) yellow(4) and azure(8). The grids seem to be composed of three horizontal bands of repeating patterns, separated by white rows. The key seems to lie in how the central band of each pattern is altered while the upper and lower bands remain unchanged. The alteration often involves specific colors within a sub-region.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Each pattern consists of three bands (rows of data).\n2.  **Isolate Central Bands:** Within each of the three main patterns, isolate the central band (rows 6-8, rows 10-12, rows 14-16, of the entire 29 x 29 grid).\n3. **Shift central bands**. Transform pattern 1 by making the central bands of pattern 1 become the central bands of pattern 2. Transform pattern 2 by making the central bands of pattern 2 become the central bands of pattern 3. The central bands in the output for pattern 3 remain the same as pattern 3 in the input.\n4.  **Reconstruct Output:** Combine the unchanged upper and lower bands of each original input pattern with the modified central band. Maintain the white (0) pixel rows as separators.\n\nIn essence, the transformation cyclically shifts the central band *downward* across the patterns. Pattern 1 gets the central band of pattern 2, Pattern 2 gets pattern 3's and Pattern 3 remains the same.\n"
