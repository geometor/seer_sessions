Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The code's core concept of identifying patterns separated by white rows and shifting central bands is partially correct. However, there are errors in the precise implementation, particularly in how the central bands are defined and which bands are swapped. The errors consistently involve incorrect placement of the swapped bands, especially in Examples 1 and 2. Example 3 highlights that the band-swapping logic is not universally applicable, sometimes requiring band retention instead of swapping.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Central Band Identification:** The current method for calculating `central_start` and `central_end` isn't always accurate, and an off by one error can easily occur. We need to improve its precision.

2.  **Revisit Band Swapping Logic:** The assumption that bands are always swapped between adjacent patterns (1->2, 2->3) is incorrect. Example 3's expected output shows that sometimes a band might be kept rather than replaced. We need a more flexible, conditional swapping mechanism. The swapping needs to be more sophisticated and may require looking at more than immediate neighboring bands.

3. **Consider edge cases**: The current solution does not handle edge cases, for example what if there are only 1 or 2 sections.

**Gather Metrics:**

I will calculate the differences using numpy and review the original and expected outputs.
