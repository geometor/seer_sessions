1. **Divide into Patterns:** Split the input grid into patterns separated by rows of all white (0) pixels.
2. **Identify Central Bands:** For each pattern, find the central three rows. If a pattern has fewer than 3 rows, consider the entire pattern as the central band.
3. **Conditional Band Swapping/Retention:**
   - If there are 3 or more patterns:
     - The central band of pattern 1 is replaced by the central band of pattern 2.
     - The central band of pattern 2 is replaced by the central band of pattern 3.
     - The central band of the last pattern is swapped with first.
   - If there are fewer than 3 patterns, retain the central bands of all patterns.
4. **Reconstruct Output:** Form the output grid by combining the modified central bands and separator rows.
