            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe code correctly identifies the overall structure: three patterns separated by white rows. It also correctly extracts the central bands. However, the shifting logic is flawed. The original description had a \"cyclical shift\" that wasn't quite correct. It should be more specific about how the central bands are moved and which ones are affected, taking into account *all* provided examples. The errors arise from incorrectly moving the central bands between the patterns. The second and third examples clarify the movement of the central bands.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Pattern Identification:** Double-check that pattern separation by white rows is consistent across all examples.\n2.  **Precise Central Band Definition:** Verify the definition of \"central band.\" Does it always mean exactly three rows? Is it always the *exact* center, or is there some flexibility?\n3. **Band Movement Clarification**:\n    *   Explicitly define the mapping: Pattern 1's central band goes where? Pattern 2's? Pattern 3's?\n    *   Use all of the provided examples to get the movement exactly correct.\n4.  **Edge Cases:** Consider edge cases where a pattern might not have a clear \"central\" band (e.g., a very short pattern). The current logic uses `//2 - 1`, which is a good start, but we should verify its behavior.\n5.  **YAML and Program Update:** Use the metrics to create a highly specific YAML description and a revised natural language program.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nLet's use code execution to extract some specific properties for checking assumptions. Specifically, let's check the `patterns` and `central_bands` variables in the provided `transform` function.\n\n"
