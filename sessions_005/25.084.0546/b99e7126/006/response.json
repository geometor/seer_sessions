However, it fails to accurately reproduce the expected outputs in all three test cases. The primary issues seem to be:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Swapping Logic:** The swapping logic only considers the first two patterns and replaces the central band of the *i*-th pattern with the central band of *i+1*-th pattern. It needs to be modified so the central band from pattern *i+1* replaces pattern *i*. Also, it is only swapping two patterns.\n2.  **Handling of the Last Pattern:** The last pattern is retained. However, example 1 and 2 suggests more intricate swapping is required for the patterns and that they do not behave differently.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Revise Swapping:** Modify the code to correctly swap central bands between patterns and handle patterns beyond just two. We need to swap the bands.\n2.  **Edge Cases:** Ensure the code handles edge cases, such as patterns with fewer than three rows, correctly, and it should account for all patterns.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nLet's use a code block to gather some data.\n"
