            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize improvements.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe code performs some of the intended transformations, but it fails to correctly handle the spatial relationships and conditional expansions, especially concerning the interaction between green and red pixels. The vertical expansion of green is overly aggressive and not properly constrained by the presence of background pixels or other green pixels. The insertion of green to the left of isolated red regions is also not completely accurate, sometimes stopping too soon. The diagonal adjacency check seems correct but not the orthogonal adjacency, as the inserted greens don't correctly expand vertically.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Green Expansion:** The vertical expansion of green needs to be more carefully controlled. It should stop not only at background (8) pixels but also at existing green (3) pixels. Moreover, the expansion seems to happen regardless of direct adjacency to a red pixel *after* the initial blue-to-red conversion. The logic should consider the adjacency *after* the conversion and not only based on initial green positions.\n\n2.  **Correct Left-Side Green Insertion:** The placement of green to the left of isolated red regions needs adjustment. It seems the logic doesn't correctly extend up/down on all examples, sometimes it does not start in the correct row, or it extends too far.\n\n3.  **Re-evaluate Adjacency:** Ensure that the adjacency checks (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) are correctly used in the appropriate contexts. The conditional expansion of existing green pixels needs to consider adjacency *after* step 1 (blue-to-red conversion).\n\n4. Improve structure of steps 4. and 5. by correctly filling and expanding in the proper order.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (using code execution when needed):**\n\nI'll manually go over each example here, since I've already seen the visual outputs. A code execution block isn't strictly necessary for this manual comparison.\n\n*   **Example 1:** The expansion of the single green pixel is incorrect. It expands too far downwards and misses some upwards expansion. Green insertion to the left of the red is correct in placement, but expansion is missing.\n*   **Example 2:** Conditional expansion due to existing green pixels does not account for the transformed red. Green insertion misses multiple blocks. The vertical expansion of the inserted Green is overly aggressive.\n*   **Example 3:** Similar problems to example 2: existing green expansion occurs everywhere; inserted green is not expanded correctly.\n*   **Example 4:** Similar errors, especially with the conditional expansion of existing green and the inserted green expansion missing rows.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
