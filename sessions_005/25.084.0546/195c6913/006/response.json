            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the `code_00.py` execution on the three training examples.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe code performs object identification and enclosure detection, which are crucial parts of the transformation. It attempts to apply different rules based on the enclosing color and the color of the enclosed object. However, the results show significant discrepancies between the transformed outputs and the expected outputs, especially in examples 1 and 3. Example 2 does better probably by coincidence since the rule is wrong. This suggests the logic for color changes and reflection/flipping operations needs substantial refinement. The all zero's become 1 is generally correct, but implemented in the wrong place - should be last. The reflection code for example two is attempting to reflect both horizontally and vertically - which is incorrect.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Rule Accuracy:** The primary focus should be on correctly interpreting and implementing the transformation rules observed in each example.\n2.  **Iterative Refinement:** We need to analyze each example's failure points individually and iteratively adjust the code and program description.\n3.  **Decompose Transformations:** Break down complex transformations (like the flipping in Example 2) into simpler, verifiable steps.\n4.  **Improve Object Handling:** We have `find_objects`, but we are not being specific enough for example 2 - we need to specify that there are *two* enclosed objects and handle them as a combined unit.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis (using code execution):**\n\nI'll use code execution to gather more specific information on color distributions and object properties in the input and expected output grids.\n\n"
