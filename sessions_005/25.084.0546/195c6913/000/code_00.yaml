  - type: observation
    description: Specific changes and patterns
    instances:
      - example_1: "Color 2 regions within color 3 regions become color 8 or color 0 based on the relative location"
      - example_2: "Color 4 and 1 inside 8 become flipped and sometimes the colors themselves flip, then the surrounding 8s turn the color of the interior"
      - example_3: "Color 4 in bottom right corner are operated on, with 1,2,3 acting on them."
