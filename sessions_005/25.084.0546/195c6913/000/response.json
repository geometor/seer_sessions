The transformation seems to involve a complex interplay of object identification, color replacement, and possibly some form of pattern recognition or mirroring.  There's a strong sense of \"objectness,\" where contiguous regions of the same color are treated as units. There appears to be some form of manipulation or interaction happening within these objects, possibly based on location, size, or neighboring objects.  It's not a simple, uniform color swap. Some color changes are contextual.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

It involves identifying objects, recognizing their relationships, and applying transformations based on those relationships.\n"
