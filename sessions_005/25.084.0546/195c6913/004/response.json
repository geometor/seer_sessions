            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe code performs poorly on the training examples, indicating significant flaws in the transformation logic. The primary issues seem to stem from:\n\n1.  **Incomplete Rule Implementation:** The code doesn't fully capture the complex, context-dependent rules observed in the examples.  It attempts to handle enclosed objects and relative positioning, but the implementation is incomplete and sometimes incorrect.\n2.  **Incorrect Color Changes:** The color changes are not always applied correctly, especially in cases involving multiple nested enclosures or specific spatial relationships. The \"enclosing color changes\" logic, in particular, seems overly simplistic and needs refinement.\n3. **Background Change:** The rule that all background (0) changes to (1) isn't applied correctly.\n4. Example 2: Color flipping is applied to coordinates outside of an object.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:**  The `find_objects` function seems to work correctly (identifying contiguous regions of the same color), so we'll keep that.\n2.  **Improve Enclosure Detection:**  The `is_enclosed` function is also fundamentally correct (checking for complete enclosure by a single color), so we'll retain that.\n3.  **Revisit Transformation Logic:** We need to break down the transformation rules for each example meticulously, paying close attention to:\n    *   The *conditions* under which a color change occurs (enclosure, relative position, neighboring colors).\n    *   The *specific* color changes that take place.\n    *   The *order* in which rules are applied.\n4. **Contextual Rules** Develop a better method for implementing the context-based rules in a consistent manner.\n5.  **Iterative Refinement:** We'll analyze each example, adjust the natural language program and the code, and re-test until the code correctly transforms all training examples.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nTo better understand the errors, let's collect some data about colors and enclosures.\n\n"
