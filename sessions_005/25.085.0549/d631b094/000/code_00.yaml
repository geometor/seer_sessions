task_description: Extract the non-white color and its count from the input grid to construct the output grid.
examples:
  - id: train_1
    input:
      grid_size: [3, 3]
      pixels:
        - color: 7 # orange
          count: 1
    output:
      grid_size: [1, 1]
      pixels:
        - color: 7 # orange
          count: 1
  - id: train_2
    input:
      grid_size: [3, 3]
      pixels:
        - color: 2 # red
          count: 3
    output:
      grid_size: [1, 3]
      pixels:
        - color: 2 # red
          count: 3
  - id: train_3
    input:
      grid_size: [3, 3]
      pixels:
        - color: 8 # azure
          count: 4
    output:
      grid_size: [1, 4]
      pixels:
        - color: 8 # azure
          count: 4
  - id: train_4
    input:
      grid_size: [3, 3]
      pixels:
        - color: 1 # blue
          count: 2
    output:
      grid_size: [1, 2]
      pixels:
        - color: 1 # blue
          count: 2
transformation:
  input_analysis:
    - Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid.
    - Determine the color of these non-white pixels (assuming only one non-white color exists per input).
    - Count the total number of these non-white pixels.
  output_construction:
    - Create a new grid with 1 row and a number of columns equal to the count determined from the input.
    - Fill all pixels of this new grid with the non-white color identified from the input.
