Each input grid features a small number of pixels of a single non-white color.\n2.  **Output Grid Analysis:** The output grids are always 1xN, where N varies. They contain only one color, which is the same non-white color present in the corresponding input grid.\n3.  **Relationship between Input and Output:**\n    *   The color used in the output grid is identical to the non-white color found in the input grid.\n    *   The number of pixels in the output grid (N) is equal to the total count of non-white pixels in the input grid.\n4.  **Object Identification:** The non-white pixels in the input grid can be considered as a single group or collection, even if not always contiguous (e.g., example 2 and 4). The task focuses on the *count* and *color* of these pixels, rather than their shape or arrangement.\n5.  **Transformation Rule:** The transformation identifies the non-white color present in the input grid and counts how many pixels of that color exist. It then creates a new grid (a single row) filled with that color, with a length equal to the count.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
