## Perception

1.  **Input Grid Analysis:** The input grids are small (3x3 in all examples) and contain mostly white (0) pixels. Each input grid features a small number of pixels of a single non-white color.
2.  **Output Grid Analysis:** The output grids are always 1xN, where N varies. They contain only one color, which is the same non-white color present in the corresponding input grid.
3.  **Relationship between Input and Output:**
    *   The color used in the output grid is identical to the non-white color found in the input grid.
    *   The number of pixels in the output grid (N) is equal to the total count of non-white pixels in the input grid.
4.  **Object Identification:** The non-white pixels in the input grid can be considered as a single group or collection, even if not always contiguous (e.g., example 2 and 4). The task focuses on the *count* and *color* of these pixels, rather than their shape or arrangement.
5.  **Transformation Rule:** The transformation identifies the non-white color present in the input grid and counts how many pixels of that color exist. It then creates a new grid (a single row) filled with that color, with a length equal to the count.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Extract the non-white color and its count from the input grid to construct the output grid.
examples:
  - id: train_1
    input:
      grid_size: [3, 3]
      pixels:
        - color: 7 # orange
          count: 1
    output:
      grid_size: [1, 1]
      pixels:
        - color: 7 # orange
          count: 1
  - id: train_2
    input:
      grid_size: [3, 3]
      pixels:
        - color: 2 # red
          count: 3
    output:
      grid_size: [1, 3]
      pixels:
        - color: 2 # red
          count: 3
  - id: train_3
    input:
      grid_size: [3, 3]
      pixels:
        - color: 8 # azure
          count: 4
    output:
      grid_size: [1, 4]
      pixels:
        - color: 8 # azure
          count: 4
  - id: train_4
    input:
      grid_size: [3, 3]
      pixels:
        - color: 1 # blue
          count: 2
    output:
      grid_size: [1, 2]
      pixels:
        - color: 1 # blue
          count: 2
transformation:
  input_analysis:
    - Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid.
    - Determine the color of these non-white pixels (assuming only one non-white color exists per input).
    - Count the total number of these non-white pixels.
  output_construction:
    - Create a new grid with 1 row and a number of columns equal to the count determined from the input.
    - Fill all pixels of this new grid with the non-white color identified from the input.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input grid to find all pixels that are not white (color 0).
2.  Identify the color of these non-white pixels. There will be only one such color in any given input.
3.  Count the total number of pixels having this non-white color.
4.  Construct the output grid as a single row.
5.  Set the width of the output row to be equal to the count obtained in step 3.
6.  Fill every pixel in the output row with the non-white color identified in step 2.
