"""
Takes an input grid and swaps the contents of adjacent pairs of rows.
Iterates through the rows starting from the top (index 0) with a step of 2.
If a row `i` and the next row `i+1` both exist, their contents are swapped.
If the grid has an odd number of rows, the last row remains in its original position.
