task_description: Rearranges rows within the input grid.
grid_properties:
  - The grid dimensions (height and width) remain unchanged.
  - The set of colors and the count of pixels of each color remain unchanged.
objects:
  - type: row
    definition: A horizontal sequence of pixels in the grid.
actions:
  - name: swap_rows
    target: rows
    conditions:
      - Swaps the first row (index 0) with the second row (index 1). This action occurs if the grid has at least 2 rows.
      - Swaps the second-to-last row (index n-2) with the last row (index n-1), where n is the total number of rows. This action occurs if the grid has at least 4 rows.
      - Rows between index 1 and index n-2 (exclusive) are not affected by the swaps.
