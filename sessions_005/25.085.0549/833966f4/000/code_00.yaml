  type: grid
  description: A single column grid (Nx1). In the examples, N=5.
output_shape:
  type: grid
  description: Same dimensions as the input grid (Nx1).

  type: pixels
  description: Cells containing integer values 0-9 representing colors.
transformation:
  type: rearrangement
  scope: rows
  pattern: pairwise_swap
  details: |
    Iterate through the rows of the input grid using an index `i` starting from 0 and incrementing by 2.
    For each `i`, if row `i+1` exists, swap the entire content of row `i` with the entire content of row `i+1`.
    If the grid has an odd number of rows, the last row (at index N-1) is not involved in any swap and remains in its original position in the output.
invariants:
  - Grid dimensions remain the same.
  - The multiset of pixel values remains the same.
variants:
  - The vertical position (row index) of pixel values changes based on the pairwise swapping rule.
