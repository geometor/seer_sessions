The value at row 2 (blue/1) remains unchanged. The value at row 3 (magenta/6) swaps with the value at row 4 (azure/8).\n- In `train_2`, the value at row 0 (yellow/4) swaps with the value at row 1 (green/3). The value at row 2 (magenta/6) remains unchanged. The value at row 3 (red/2) swaps with the value at row 4 (azure/8).\nThe pattern appears to be swapping the contents of adjacent pairs of rows, starting from the top (rows 0 and 1, rows 2 and 3, and so on). If there is an odd number of rows, the last row remains in its original position.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
