*   **Perception**:
    *   Both input and output grids are 3x3 squares.
    *   The colors present in the input grid appear to be the same as the colors in the output grid, but their positions have changed.
    *   Comparing the positions of specific colors:
        *   Example 1: The '2' (red) at input position (0, 2) moves to output position (2, 0). The '1' (blue) at input (1, 0) moves to output (1, 2). The two '5's (gray) at input (0, 0) and (0, 1) move to output (2, 2) and (2, 1) respectively. The '0's (white) also change positions accordingly.
        *   Example 2: The '8' (azure) at input (0, 2) moves to output (2, 0). The '7' (orange) at input (1, 1) stays at output (1, 1). The '5' (gray) at input (2, 0) moves to output (0, 2). The '3's (green) also change positions.
    *   This pattern of movement corresponds to a 180-degree rotation of the entire grid. Each pixel at input position (row, col) moves to output position (height-1-row, width-1-col).

*   **YAML Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: geometric_transformation
    transformation: rotation
    details:
      - object: input_grid
        property: dimensions (height x width)
        value: constant (3x3 in examples)
      - action: rotate_grid
        degrees: 180
        center: center_of_the_grid
      - result: output_grid
        relationship_to_input: input_grid rotated 180 degrees
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Take the input grid.
    2.  Rotate the entire input grid by 180 degrees around its center.
    3.  The resulting grid is the output grid.
