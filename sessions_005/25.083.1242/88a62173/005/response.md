"""
The transformation extracts a 2x2 subgrid from the input grid and rearranges its elements to form the output grid. The exact positions in the source *and* destination of this 2x2 sub grid within the input grid are not fixed to the top-left corner but might change for each input, and the position of elements within the subgrid are also rearranged. The program must determine the logic for selecting *which* 2x2 subgrid of the input is used, and *how* it is arranged into the output grid. The core logic appears to be focused on a 2x2 sub area, its selection, and internal rearrangement.
