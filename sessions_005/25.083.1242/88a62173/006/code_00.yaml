objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x cols)
      - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - color_distribution: varies per example

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2x2
      - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - color_distribution: derived from input_grid

  - name: subgrid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2x2
      - elements: integers (0-9)
      - source: derived from input_grid
      - location: variable within input_grid

actions:
  - name: select_subgrid
    input: input_grid
    output: subgrid
    rule: "Select a 2x2 region within the input_grid based on a yet-to-be-determined rule (likely involving color and relative position)."

  - name: rearrange_subgrid
    input: subgrid
    output: output_grid
    rule: "Rearrange the elements of the selected subgrid to form the output_grid, based on a consistent, yet-to-be-determined transformation."
