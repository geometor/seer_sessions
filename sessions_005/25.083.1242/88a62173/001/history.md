Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the underlying transformation logic. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both grids of digits (representing colors).
*   The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids.
*   The output grids seem to extract a specific 2x2 section from the top left corner area of a consistent object, based upon a pattern, within each input grid.
*   The background appears to be consistently black (0).
*   The examples use different non-zero colors.
*   There's a recurring pattern in the input grids: a 5x5 grid where the top-left 2x2 quadrant seems to have all its pixels in the non-zero colors, and the distribution of non-zero color pixels in this upper-left sub-grid has non-zero cells on its diagonal. The rest of the top row and left column of the input has an alternating color and black pattern, starting with color. The rest of the grid is filled with black.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2x2
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - object: pattern
    type: alternating
    properties:
      - colors: non-zero and 0
      - start: top-left corner, non-zero color
      - extent: top row and first column
  - relation: output_grid_extraction
    description: The output grid is a 2x2 subgrid extracted from the input_grid
    location: Based on the location of two adjecent non-zero color pixels at the top-left corner of the grid
  - action: ExtractSubgrid
    input_object: input_grid
    parameter:
      location: top_left_corner_pattern
      size: 2x2
    output: output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Pattern:** Locate the 2x2 subgrid at the top-left of the input grid, limited by the non-zero color pixels which are part of an alternating pattern of color and black, starting with color, that extends to the right and downwards.
2.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the 2x2 subgrid identified based on these non-zero corner pixels.
3. **Output result:** Return the extracted 2x2 section.

In essence, the transformation identifies a specific portion of an alternating pattern of color and black within the input grid, extracts the "corner", and produces that as the output.
