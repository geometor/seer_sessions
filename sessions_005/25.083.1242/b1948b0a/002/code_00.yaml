objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents a rectangular grid of colored pixels.
    properties:
      - rows: Number of rows in the grid.
      - columns: Number of columns in the grid.
      - cells: Individual pixels within the grid, identified by row and column.
        - value: Integer representing the color of the pixel (0-9).
        - neighbors: List of adjacent cells, including diagonals.

actions:
  - name: identify_neighbors
    description: Finds all adjacent cells (including diagonals) for a given cell.
    input:
      - grid: The 2D array.
      - row: Row index of the target cell.
      - col: Column index of the target cell.
    output:
      - neighbors: A list of the values of the neighboring cells.

  - name: replace_pixel
    description: >
        Conditionally replaces a pixel's value.
        If a cell has a value of 6 and any of its neighbors
        have a value of 7, the cell's value is changed to 2.
    input:
      - grid: The 2D array
      - row: Row index of cell
      - col: column index of cell
    output: none - updates grid in place
