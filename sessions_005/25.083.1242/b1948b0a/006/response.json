The code correctly identifies the core concept of replacing 6s with 2s based on neighboring 7s, but fails to apply this precisely as demonstrated in the three provided examples. The code has good form, but it contains a bug as illustrated by example 1.\u00a0 Example 2 & 3 are successful, example 1 is not.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Example 1 Failure:** Pinpoint the exact reason why the first example fails. The failure on this will likely inform the others.\n2.  **Review All Examples:** Examine all examples to confirm that the corrected logic applies consistently.\n3. **Refine Natural Language:** Rewrite it to express the updated rule that is valid for all examples.\n4.  **YAML Facts:** create a YAML to capture objects, properties and actions\n5. **Code Metrics** provide some calculations to help support assumptions about the solution\n\n**Code Metrics**\nLet's confirm some basic information about each example\n\n"
