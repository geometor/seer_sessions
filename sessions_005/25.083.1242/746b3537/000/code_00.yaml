task_elements:
  - type: 2D grid
    description: Input and output data are represented as 2D grids.
    properties:
      - height: variable
      - width: variable
      - cell_values: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - type: object
    description: contiguous area of the same color, could be line
    properties:
        -color

  - type: row
    description: A horizontal line of pixels within a grid.

  - type: column
    description: A vertical line of pixels within a grid.

observations:
  - train_1:
    - input_width equals output_width
    - Each row of input is composed of all the same colors.
    - First element of each row in input becomes single element of each row in output.

  - train_2:
    - Each row of input is composed of unique colors.
    - Output is one row of all input colors

  - train_3:
      - each row is identical
      - output removes repeating colors in input row

  - train_4:
      - height of output is one less than width of input
      - each row is identical colors
      - output removes repeating colors

  - train_5:
    - input width is 4
    - output width is 1

transformation_type:
  - operation: Selection/Extraction
  - description: The transformation seems to involve selecting specific rows or columns from the input grid.
