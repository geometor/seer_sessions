facts:
  - observation: Input grids contain only colors 0 (white) and 5 (gray).
  - observation: Output grids have same dimensions as corresponding input grids.
  - observation: There is no direct color conversion; a positional rule is applied.
  - observation: The input positions of color 5 (gray) determine the output color at that position.
  - observation: Top-Left gray pixel gets replaced by a 3 (green).
  - observation: Top-Right gray pixel gets replaced by a 3 (green).
  - observation: Bottom-Left gray pixel gets replaced by a 2 (red).
  - observation: Bottom-Right gray pixel gets replaced by a x (?).
  - observation: Center gray pixel gets replaced by a 4 (yellow).
  - observation: Middle-Left gray pixel gets replaced by a x (?).
  - observation: Middle-Right gray pixel gets replaced by a x (?).
  - observation: Top-Middle gray pixel gets replaced by a x (?).
  - observation: Bottom-Middle gray pixel gets replaced by a x (?).
  - rule: Output color depends on the (row,col) position of the '5' in the input.
  - assumption: All '0' pixels in the input are replaced by a same color in output.
