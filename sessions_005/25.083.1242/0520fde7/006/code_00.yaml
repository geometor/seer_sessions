facts:
  - object: gray_pixel
    color: 5
    description: Source of the transformation.
  - object: blue_pixel
    color: 1
    description: Triggers the transformation when adjacent to a gray pixel.
  - object: red_pixel
    color: 2
    description: Result of the transformation, placed in the output grid.
  - object: output_grid
    size: 3x3
    description: Contains red pixels based on the adjacency rule.
  - relation: adjacency
    description: A gray pixel and a blue pixel are adjacent if they share a side (not diagonal).
  - action: transform
    input: gray_pixel
    condition: adjacency with blue_pixel
    output: red_pixel in output_grid
    output_placement_rule: |
        If blue is to the left of gray, place red at (1,0).
        If blue is to the right of gray, place red at (1,2).
        If blue is above the gray, place red at (0, 1). This condition is not in this task version.
        If blue is below the gray, place red at (2, 1). This condition is not in this task version.
        If a gray pixel is next to multiple blue pixels, output should contain a red pixel for each, at this point, this does not seem to happen. The examples only trigger one position based on left/right adjacency
