Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The core task appears to involve a specific type of object replacement or filtering.  The input grids contain the value `5` (gray) which seems to act as a key or delimiter. The output grids are the same dimensions as the input grids. The output grids consist almost entirely of `0` (white), except for `2` (red) values. The `2` (red) values in the output seem to correspond to the locations of the `1` (blue) values that are directly adjacent to `5` (gray) in the input grid, but with a shift.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid_dimensions: 3x7 (all examples)
  - output_grid_dimensions: 3x3 (all examples)
  - input_values: [0, 1, 5]
  - output_values: [0, 2]
  - key_value: 5  # Value that seems to trigger the transformation.
  - replaced_values: 1  # Values adjacent to the key are possibly transformed.
  - output_value: 2 # Value appearing in output, related to location of value 1
  - spatial_relationship: |
      The output grid is a 3x3 area.
      The locations of 2s in output grids somehow corresponding to locations of 1s that near 5 in input grids
  - grid_size_change: Input grids are 3x7 and output grids are 3x3
  - color_mapping:
    0: white
    1: blue
    2: red
    5: gray
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Value:** Locate all occurrences of the value `5` (gray) within the input grid.

2.  **Locate relative value:** Locate all `1` (blue) that near value `5`.

3.  **Determine Output Locations:** For each `1` near `5` in input, change output at different relative location to `2`. Here is the mapping:

    *   blue above gray: red at \[row, col] of top-left of the output
    *   blue below gray: red at \[row+2, col] of top-left of the output
    *   blue left of gray: red at \[row, col] of top-left of the output
    *   blue right of gray: red at \[row, col+2] of top-left of the output

4.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill all other cells in the output grid with `0` (white).
