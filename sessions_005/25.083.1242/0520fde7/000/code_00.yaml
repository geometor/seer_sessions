facts:
  - input_grid_dimensions: 3x7 (all examples)
  - output_grid_dimensions: 3x3 (all examples)
  - input_values: [0, 1, 5]
  - output_values: [0, 2]
  - key_value: 5  # Value that seems to trigger the transformation.
  - replaced_values: 1  # Values adjacent to the key are possibly transformed.
  - output_value: 2 # Value appearing in output, related to location of value 1
  - spatial_relationship: |
      The output grid is a 3x3 area.
      The locations of 2s in output grids somehow corresponding to locations of 1s that near 5 in input grids
  - grid_size_change: Input grids are 3x7 and output grids are 3x3
  - color_mapping:
    0: white
    1: blue
    2: red
    5: gray
