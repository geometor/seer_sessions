objects:
  - grid: 3x3 matrix of colored pixels
  - pixels: individual cells within the grid, each with a color value (0-9)

properties:
  - grid_size: fixed at 3x3
  - pixel_color: integer value (0-9) representing a color
  - pixel_position: row and column index within the grid

actions:
  - rotate:  pixels appear to move in some rotational pattern
  - Possibly some type of reflection or swapping of rows/columns combined with the rotation.

relationships:
  - input_grid_to_output_grid: a transformation maps the input grid to the output grid
  - pixel_position_change: the position of a pixel in the input grid is related to its position in the output grid by a consistent rule
