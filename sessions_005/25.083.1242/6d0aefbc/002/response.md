Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize for improvement.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program ("Duplicate each column of the input grid to its right, resulting in an output grid with double the width") was a good starting point, but the code implementation has a flaw. It seems to be appending columns in the wrong order, or perhaps misinterpreting which axis represents columns. The consistent `Pixels Off` and `Size Correct` results suggest the core idea of duplication is correct, but the arrangement is wrong. The strategy will be to:

1.  Carefully examine the provided input, expected output, and transformed output for *each* example.
2.  Pinpoint exactly *which* pixels are incorrect. This might reveal a consistent pattern in the error.
3.  Revisit the code's logic, especially the indexing and appending, to fix the column arrangement.
4. rephrase the natural language program for clarity

**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code execution for precise details):**

I need a structured way to compare the input, expected output, and transformed output. I will build small matrices and execute the code block to perform a precise diff, counting pixels in each, and report the differences.


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)
    transformed_output = np.array(transformed_output)

    diff_expected_transformed = np.sum(expected_output != transformed_output)
    print(f"Pixels different between Expected and Transformed: {diff_expected_transformed}")

    unique_input, counts_input = np.unique(input_grid, return_counts=True)
    unique_expected, counts_expected = np.unique(expected_output, return_counts=True)
    unique_transformed, counts_transformed = np.unique(transformed_output, return_counts=True)
    print(f"Input: Unique colors: {unique_input}, Counts: {counts_input}")
    print(f"Expected: Unique colors: {unique_expected}, Counts: {counts_expected}")
    print(f"Transformed: Unique colors: {unique_transformed}, Counts: {counts_transformed}")
    return

examples = [
    (
        [[6, 6, 6], [1, 6, 1], [8, 8, 6]],
        [[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 1], [8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8]],
        [[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [1, 1, 6, 6, 1, 1], [8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6]]
    ),
    (
        [[6, 8, 1], [6, 1, 1], [1, 1, 6]],
        [[6, 8, 1, 1, 8, 6], [6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6], [1, 1, 6, 6, 1, 1]],
        [[6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 1], [6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6]]
    ),
    (
        [[1, 1, 1], [8, 1, 6], [6, 8, 8]],
        [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [8, 1, 6, 6, 1, 8], [6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6]],
        [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [8, 8, 1, 1, 6, 6], [6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]]
    ),
    (
        [[1, 1, 1], [1, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6]],
        [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]],
        [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]]
    )
]

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
observations:
  - task: column_duplication
  - input_grid:
      properties:
        - width: original_width
        - height: original_height
        - pixel_values: integers_0-9
      objects:
          - columns:
            properties:
                - composed_of: pixels of a single color or multiple colors
                - action: duplicated
  - output_grid:
      properties:
        - width: 2 * original_width
        - height: original_height
        - pixel_values: same as input_grid
      objects:
          - columns:
            properties:
              - composed_of: original column followed by a copy of that same column

```


**Revised Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is: For each column in the input grid, create an identical copy of that column.  The output grid consists of each original input column immediately followed by its duplicate. The width of the output grid is twice the width of the input grid, and the height remains the same. The order of columns from left to right is preserved and duplicated.
