Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on elements, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (representing colors). The transformation seems to involve a kind of mirroring or duplication of the input grid's rows and columns, resulting in an output grid that is double the width of the input. The duplicated pixels maintain their original values, appearing as reflections across a vertical axis in the center of the output grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      properties:
        width: number of columns
        height: number of rows

actions:
  - duplicate_columns:
      description: Each column in the input grid is duplicated to the right of itself.
      details: it is not appended as a full copy of the original input, but duplicated one by one

relationships:
  - input_output_size:
      description: The output grid's width is twice the input grid's width. The height remains the same.
  - pixel_values:
      description: pixel color/value is conserved

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each column of the input grid.
2.  For each column: **Duplicate** the original column and insert/append *to the right* of the original column, resulting in a new column with the same values in the same order.
3. The resulting grid has twice the number of columns of the original grid, but its height remains the same.

In essence, the transformation duplicates each column of the input grid to its right, effectively creating a horizontally "mirrored" (but not a true mirror image, as the order is not reversed) output.
