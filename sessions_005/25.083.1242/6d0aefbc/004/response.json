The code currently interleaves the original and duplicated columns, which is incorrect based on several of the provided examples. The core concept of doubling the width and maintaining the height is correct.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze all input/output pairs, paying close attention to how the columns are re-arranged (or not) in the output.\n2.  **Correct the Column Ordering:** Modify the natural language program to specifically state that the *entire* input grid is duplicated and appended to the *right* of the original, rather than interleaving.\n3.  **Update Code and Re-test:** Adjust the code based on the revised program.  Re-run the tests to verify the fix.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (No Code Execution Needed):**\n\nThe provided results already give us key metrics. Let's summarize:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 8\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Issue: Incorrect column order.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 11\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Issue: Incorrect column order.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 7\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Issue: Incorrect column order.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *    Pixels Off: 2\n    *    Size Correct: True\n    *    Issue: Incorrect column order.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
