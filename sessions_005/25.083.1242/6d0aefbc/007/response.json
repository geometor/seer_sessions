Then, the *order of the columns* in the duplicated portion is reversed. Finally, the original input grid and the column-reversed duplicate are joined together, side-by-side. The output grid's width is twice the input grid's width, and the height remains the same. The transformation can be described as a horizontal mirror or reflection along the Y axis.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by appending a horizontally mirrored copy of itself to the right.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    # Duplicate the input grid\n    duplicated_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    # Reverse the order of columns in the duplicated grid\n    mirrored_grid = np.fliplr(duplicated_grid)\n    # Concatenate the original grid with the mirrored grid along the horizontal axis\n    output_grid = np.concatenate((input_grid, mirrored_grid), axis=1)\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```\n"
