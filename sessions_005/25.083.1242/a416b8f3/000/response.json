The primary operation appears to be a duplication of the input grid. The output grid is exactly twice the width of the input grid. The content of the input grid seems to be replicated horizontally to create the output grid. There are no apparent changes in colors or the relative positions of pixels within the duplicated sections.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
