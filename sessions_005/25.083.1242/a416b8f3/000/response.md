Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, outlining my perception of the task, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid-based transformation. The primary operation appears to be a duplication of the input grid. The output grid is exactly twice the width of the input grid. The content of the input grid seems to be replicated horizontally to create the output grid. There are no apparent changes in colors or the relative positions of pixels within the duplicated sections.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "The output grid is horizontally twice as wide as the input grid."
  - observation: "The input grid's content is duplicated."
  - observation: "The left half of the output grid is identical to the input grid."
  - observation: "The right half of the output grid is identical to the input grid."
  - relationship: "The output grid is a horizontal concatenation of the input grid with itself."
  - property: "Colors of pixels remain consistent during duplication."
  - property: "Relative positions of pixels within the duplicated segment are preserved."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Obtain Input:** Take the input grid.
2.  **Duplicate Horizontally:** Create an exact copy of the input grid.
3. **Concatenate:** Join the original input grid and its copy horizontally. Place the copy to the right of the original.
4.  **Output:** Return the combined grid as the output.
