Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The code performs well on most examples but fails on Example 3. The primary issue seems to be the handling of corners and edge cases within green lines, particularly when diagonal green lines intersect. The current logic correctly identifies green lines and checks for adjacent white pixels. However, it doesn't account for situations where diagonal green lines might influence replacement decisions.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Corner/Intersection Handling:** The core issue is how intersections of green lines are handled. We need to explicitly consider that green pixels at the intersection of two perpendicular lines could be impacted by two lines.
2. **Examine Example 3:** Focus on Example 3, using it to test the code to ensure there is a full understanding of why those specific pixels are incorrect.

**Metrics and Observations (Example by Example):**

Let's get more detailed about what is in the example data.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Green Lines:** Locate all horizontal and vertical lines composed of two or more contiguous green (3) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Endpoint Evaluation:** For the first and last pixels of each green line (endpoints):
    *   If an endpoint has two *or more* adjacent white pixels (up, down, left, or right), replace it with azure (8).
    *   If an endpoint has only *one* adjacent white pixel, replace with azure if and only if there is at least one green pixel adjacent to this end point.

3.  **Interior Pixel Evaluation:** For all other pixels within each green line (not the first and last pixels):
    *    If a green pixel has *at least one* adjacent white pixel (up, down, left, or right), replace it with azure (8).

4.  **Copy Unmodified Pixels:** Any pixel that is not green, or does not meet the above replacement criteria within a green line, is copied directly from the input grid to the output grid.
