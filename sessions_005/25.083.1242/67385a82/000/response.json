Azure (8) appears in the output grids where green (3) was present.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** The transformation seems to be localized. Changes in the output grid correspond to specific locations of green (3) pixels in the input grid.  The overall grid dimensions remain constant.\n*\t**Specific Rule:** The core transformation is the replacement of some, but not all, green (3) pixels by azure (8). Green pixels adjacent to white pixels on at least two sides are replaced.\n\n**YAML Documentation (Facts):**\n\n"
