            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe code performs well on most examples but fails on Example 3. The primary issue seems to be the handling of corner cases and the condition for replacing green pixels with azure. The existing logic correctly identifies green lines and checks for adjacent white pixels, but the specific rules for endpoints and interior pixels need adjustment, specifically on diagonal green pixels, that get included with lines.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Example 3:** Carefully analyze why Example 3 fails. Identify the specific pixels that are incorrectly transformed and the conditions that lead to the error. It seems line ends must be adjacent to more white spaces.\n2.  **Refine Endpoint Rule:** Ensure the updated check if it has *exactly* one green pixel as a direct neighbor, and two or more white pixels adjacent to it.\n3.  **Refine Interior Pixel Rule:** The rule for interior pixels seems correct, changing to azure if there are white neighbors.\n4.  **Consider Diagonal Adjacency:** The current logic only considers up, down, left, and right neighbors. Verify.\n5.  **Simplify Conditions**: consolidate conditional statement of one or more adjacent white pixels for the line ends.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for verification):**\n\n"
