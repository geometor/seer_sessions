1.  **Identify Green Lines:** Locate all horizontal and vertical lines composed of two or more contiguous green (3) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Endpoint Evaluation:** For the first and last pixels of each green line (endpoints):
    *   If an endpoint has two *or more* adjacent white pixels (up, down, left, or right), replace it with azure (8).
    *   If an endpoint has only *one* adjacent white pixel, replace with azure if and only if there is at least one green pixel adjacent to this end point.

3.  **Interior Pixel Evaluation:** For all other pixels within each green line (not the first and last pixels):
    *    If a green pixel has *at least one* adjacent white pixel (up, down, left, or right), replace it with azure (8).

4.  **Copy Unmodified Pixels:** Any pixel that is not green, or does not meet the above replacement criteria within a green line, is copied directly from the input grid to the output grid.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The code performs well on most examples but fails on Example 3. The primary issue seems to be the handling of corner cases and the condition for replacing green pixels with azure. The existing logic correctly identifies green lines and checks for adjacent white pixels, but the specific rules for endpoints and interior pixels need adjustment, specifically on diagonal green pixels, that get included with lines.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Example 3:** Carefully analyze why Example 3 fails. Identify the specific pixels that are incorrectly transformed and the conditions that lead to the error. It seems line ends must be adjacent to more white spaces.
2.  **Refine Endpoint Rule:** Ensure the updated check if it has *exactly* one green pixel as a direct neighbor, and two or more white pixels adjacent to it.
3.  **Refine Interior Pixel Rule:** The rule for interior pixels seems correct, changing to azure if there are white neighbors.
4.  **Consider Diagonal Adjacency:** The current logic only considers up, down, left, and right neighbors. Verify.
5.  **Simplify Conditions**: consolidate conditional statement of one or more adjacent white pixels for the line ends.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for verification):**

**Analysis of Incorrect Pixels in Example 3:**

The `tool_code` output reveals the following about the incorrectly transformed pixels in Example 3:

`incorrect_pixels=[(0, 0, 3, 8, 0, 2), (1, 0, 3, 8, 0, 3), (3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 2)]`

This tells us:

*   **Pixel (0, 0):** Transformed from 3 (green) to 8 (azure). It has 0 adjacent white pixels and 2 adjacent green pixels. Should have been 8.
*   **Pixel (1, 0):** Transformed from 3 (green) to 8 (azure). It has 0 adjacent white pixels and 3 adjacent green pixels. Should have been 8.
*     **Pixel (3, 3):** Transformed from 3 (green) to 8 (azure). It has 0 adjacent white pixels and 2 adjacent green pixels. Should have be 8.

The problem here is two-fold, related to lines and end points. In the first
pass, lines of 2 or more pixels were considered. In the failing example,
isolated pixels should also transform.

**YAML Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Green Pixels:** Locate all green (3) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Pixel Evaluation:** For each Green Pixel
    *   If a green pixel has *at least one* adjacent white pixel (up, down, left, or right), replace it with azure (8).
    *   If a green pixel does *not* have at least one adjacent white pixel (up, down, left or right) then, if the pixel is part of a horizontal or vertical line of 2 or more, and it is a *line end* (first or last pixel) replace with an azure pixel.

3.  **Copy Unmodified Pixels:** Any pixel that is not green, or does not meet the above replacement criteria, is copied directly from the input grid to the output grid.
