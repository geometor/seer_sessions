Okay, here's a breakdown of the results and a plan to improve the natural language program and subsequently the code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were based on a single example, leading to an oversimplified rule. The code correctly identifies green pixels and checks for adjacent white pixels, but the condition for replacing green with azure is not entirely accurate, as evidenced by the discrepancies in the test results across multiple examples. The core issue is that the rule needs refinement to better capture the nuances of *when* a green pixel should be turned azure. It's not simply about having two or more adjacent white pixels.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Discrepancies:** Carefully examine each example where the transformed output doesn't match the expected output. Pay close attention to the *position* of the green pixels relative to the white pixels and other green pixels.
2.  **Refine the Rule:** Based on the analysis, modify the natural language program to more accurately describe the transformation. Consider concepts like "enclosure" or "connectivity" of white pixels around green pixels. It seems the output azure are in a line of green and that seems key.
3. **Hypothesize, code, and test**: Use the revised natural language program to modify the transformation algorithm, test with given examples, and make more adjustments if needed.

**Gather Metrics and Observations:**

I'll use a combination of observation and code execution to understand the patterns, since the examples are small.

*Example 1*


```
Input:
3 3 0
0 3 0
3 0 3

Expected:
8 8 0
0 8 0
3 0 3

Transformed:
3 3 0
0 8 0
8 0 8
```


Observation:
Bottom left green changes when only one adjacent white, top left does not
change with one adjacent white.
Bottom right is also incorrect

*Example 2*


```
Input:
0 3 0 0 0 3
0 3 3 3 0 0
0 0 0 0 3 0
0 3 0 0 0 0

Expected:
0 8 0 0 0 3
0 8 8 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 3 0
0 3 0 0 0 0

Transformed:
0 8 0 0 0 8
0 8 8 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 0
0 8 0 0 0 0
```

Observation:
Last column, first row is incorrect, only one white adjacent.
Third row, last element, only one white adjacent.

*Example 3*


```
Input:
3 3 0 3
3 3 0 0
3 0 0 3
0 0 3 3

Expected:
8 8 0 3
8 8 0 0
8 0 0 8
0 0 8 8

Transformed:
3 3 0 8
3 8 0 0
8 0 0 8
0 0 8 3
```


Observation: Top right green, only one neighbor, shouldn't change. Bottom
right, one neighbor shouldn't change.

*Example 4*

0 8 8 0 0 0
0 3 3 0 0 8
```


Key observation across all examples: The rule seems to be applied inconsistently. The number of adjacent white pixels isn't the sole determining factor. Green pixels *between* other green pixels in a horizontal or vertical line *and* with white pixels *somewhere* adjacent, are replaced by azure. Isolated or end-of-line green pixels, with only *one* adjacent white, *do not* get replaced. This explains the seemingly contradictory behavior.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - rows
      - columns

  - name: pixel
    type: cell
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - row_index: integer
      - column_index: integer
      - adjacent_pixels: list of pixels

actions:
  - name: identify_green_pixels
    input: grid
    output: list of green pixels

  - name: check_adjacency
    input: green pixel, grid
    output: adjacent pixels, count of adjacent white pixels, count of
      adjacent green pixels

  - name: replace_pixel
    input: pixel, color
    output: modified grid

colors:
 - 0: white
 - 3: green
 - 8: azure
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Green Lines:** Find all horizontal and vertical lines formed by contiguous green (3) pixels.
2.  **White Neighbor Condition for Replacement:** Within each identified green line:
    *   A green pixel is replaced with azure (8) if it meets *both* these conditions:
        1. It has at least one adjacent white pixel (up, down, left, or right).
        2. it is *not* at either end of its line segment *unless* it has at
           least two white pixels adjacent

3.  **Copy Other Pixels:** All pixels that are not part of the green lines identified in step 1, or that do not meet the conditions within a line, are copied directly from the input grid to the output grid without modification.
