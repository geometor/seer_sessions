            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe code performs well on most examples but fails on Example 3. The primary issue seems to be the handling of corners and edge cases within green lines, particularly when diagonal green lines intersect. The current logic correctly identifies green lines and checks for adjacent white pixels. However, it doesn't account for situations where diagonal green lines might influence replacement decisions.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Corner/Intersection Handling:** The core issue is how intersections of green lines are handled. We need to explicitly consider that green pixels at the intersection of two perpendicular lines could be impacted by two lines.\n2. **Examine Example 3:** Focus on Example 3, using it to test the code to ensure there is a full understanding of why those specific pixels are incorrect.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example by Example):**\n\nLet's get more detailed about what is in the example data.\n"
