            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, including my perception of the elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input Grids:** The input grids are rectangular and filled primarily with black (0) pixels.  They contain a single red (2) pixel in varying locations.\n*   **Output Grids:** The output grids are the same dimensions as the input grids. They also consist mostly of black (0) pixels. The red (2) pixel from the input seems to trigger the appearance of new colored pixels (green (3), magenta (6), azure (8), and orange (7)) in the output. The positions of these new pixels appear to be related to the position of the red pixel in the input.\n* **Transformation:** The transformation doesn't involve simple mirroring, rotation, or translation of the red pixel. Instead, the red pixel's position seems to *seed* the placement of a set of other colored pixels. The spatial relationship between the red pixel and the new colors varies between examples, suggesting a more complex rule than direct adjacency.\n\n**YAML Block of Facts:**\n\n"

The rule that maps these locations appears to be complex and inconsistent across the provided examples, so it will take more investigation with the coder. The set of pixels to draw based on the original location will need to be hard coded or defined as a series of conditional spatial relationships.\n\nEssentially, the presence and location of the red pixel acts a set of instructions about where to place other colored pixels.\n"
