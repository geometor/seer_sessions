facts:
  - type: grid_transformation
    description: Input grid is transformed into an output grid of the same dimensions.
  - type: digit_replacement
    description: Some digits in the input grid are replaced with different digits in the output grid.
  - type: no_global_substitution
    description: The replacement is not a simple one-to-one mapping of digits. The context matters.
  - type: observation
    description: In train_1, the top-right 8 is changed to 5. The 5s around the 6 in the second row change to 8.
  - type: observation
    description: In train_2, only the middle 5 changed to 8.
  - type: observation
    description: in train_3, the 5 on row 1, col 2 changes to 8; the 5 on row 2, col 3 changes to 8; row 3 is unchanged.
  - type: spatial_relationship
    description: Changes are often localized. Look at the surroundings of a changed digit.
  - type: hypothesis
    description: The replaced numbers become the adjacent number, looking at the train set in sequence, the changed number looks down
