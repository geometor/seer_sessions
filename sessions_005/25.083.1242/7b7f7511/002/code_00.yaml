facts:
  - observation: |
      The transformation reduces the number of columns in each row, or reduces
      the number of rows. The number of rows is sometimes preserved.
  - example1:
      input_shape: (4, 8)
      output_shape: (4, 4)
      rule: "Keep every other column, starting from the first column."
      correct: False  # The initial rule is incorrect
  - example2:
      input_shape: (3, 6)
      output_shape: (3, 3)
      rule: "Keep every other column, starting from the first column."
      correct: False
  - example3:
       input_shape: (6, 2)
       output_shape: (3,2)
       rule: Select the top N rows where N = the minimum dimension of the
       input.
       correct: True
  - combined_rule_hypothesis: |
       The transformation reduces the output shape to (Min(R, C), C) where
       R, C is the shape of the original input grid.
       Take only the first min(R,C) rows from the original, then
       within those rows, take every other column, starting from the
       first column (index 0).
