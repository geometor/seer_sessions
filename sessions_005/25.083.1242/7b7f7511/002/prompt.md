The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  **Iterate** through the rows of the input grid.
2.  For each row, **select** elements (colored pixels) from left-to-right, skipping every other column, beginning the skip with the last (right-most) element.
3.  **Construct** a new row in the output grid using these selected elements.
4.  The output grid is composed of these new shortened rows, maintaining the original row order. In short: The output grid takes every other column from the input starting at the first.

Essentially every other column, starting with the last, is removed from the input.
