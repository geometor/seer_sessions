The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1. **Determine the minimum dimension:** Find the smaller value between the number of rows (R) and the number of columns (C) of the input grid.
2. **Row Selection:** Select only the first *N* rows from the input grid, where *N* is the minimum dimension determined in step 1.
3. **Column Selection:** Within the selected rows (from step 2), keep only every other column, starting with the first column (index 0).
4. **Output Construction:** The output grid is formed by these selected rows and columns.
