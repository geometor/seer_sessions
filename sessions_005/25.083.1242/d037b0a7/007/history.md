"""
The program identifies "source" rows as those having any non-zero elements.
For each source row, it copies it to the output, then modifies subsequent "target" rows.
It replaces zeros in the target row with corresponding non-zero values from the source row.
The last element of the source row is always copied to the last element of the target row.
This continues for consecutive target rows until the next source row or the end of the grid.

Okay, let's analyze the results of the `transform` function on the provided training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were too focused on the specifics of the first example. It correctly identified the concept of "source rows" and attempted to merge information from source rows to subsequent rows. However, it failed to generalize the merging rule correctly. The current implementation only replaces zeros in "target" rows with corresponding non-zero values from the "source" row, and always copies the very last element. The expected behavior is more about propagating the entire "source" row downwards, replacing *all* values in subsequent rows until another "source" row, or end of rows, is encountered.

**Metrics and Observations**

Let's analyze each example in detail. I will create a helper function to quickly calculate the differences. I will also pay close attention to color usage.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: object_identification
    description: Source rows are identified. A source row is any row containing at least one non-zero element.
  - type: object_relationship
    description: Source rows establish a pattern that propagates downwards.
  - type: action
    description: The source row is copied to the output.
  - type: action
    description: Subsequent rows (target rows) are replaced entirely by the source row.
  - type: condition
    description: Replacement continues until another source row is encountered or the grid ends.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1. **Identify Source Rows:** Scan the input grid row by row. A row is considered a "source row" if it contains *any* non-zero values.

2. **Propagate Source Rows:**
   - If a row is a source row, copy it directly to the output grid.
   - For all subsequent rows, replace the *entire* row with the content of the *last encountered* source row.
   - Continue this replacement until another source row is found or the end of the input grid is reached.

3. **Handle Non-Source Initial Rows:** If rows at the beginning of the grid are *not* source rows, copy to the output unchanged.

The critical change from the previous version is the replacement of entire rows instead of selective element-wise merging. This is essential for capturing the behavior in example 2 and 3.
