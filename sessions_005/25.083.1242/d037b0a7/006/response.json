            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the `transform` function on the provided training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were too focused on the specifics of the first example. It correctly identified the concept of \"source rows\" and attempted to merge information from source rows to subsequent rows. However, it failed to generalize the merging rule correctly. The current implementation only replaces zeros in \"target\" rows with corresponding non-zero values from the \"source\" row, and always copies the very last element. The expected behavior is more about propagating the entire \"source\" row downwards, replacing *all* values in subsequent rows until another \"source\" row, or end of rows, is encountered.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nLet's analyze each example in detail. I will create a helper function to quickly calculate the differences. I will also pay close attention to color usage.\n\n"
