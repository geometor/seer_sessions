The arrangements of 1s form different shapes, sometimes lines, sometimes L-shapes or disconnected segments.\n*   **Output Grids:** The output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids. The 1s (blue) in the input are consistently replaced by 2s (red) in the output. The output grids have an additional row of 2s added at the bottom as a copy of the last generated line.\n*   **Transformation:** There's a direct color substitution (1 becomes 2) and height expansion. The core pattern of the original shape is preserved, but its color is changed.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
