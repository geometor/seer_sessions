Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input Grids:** The input grids consist of 0s (white) and 1s (blue). The arrangements of 1s form different shapes, sometimes lines, sometimes L-shapes or disconnected segments.
*   **Output Grids:** The output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids. The 1s (blue) in the input are consistently replaced by 2s (red) in the output. The output grids have an additional row of 2s added at the bottom as a copy of the last generated line.
*   **Transformation:** There's a direct color substitution (1 becomes 2) and height expansion. The core pattern of the original shape is preserved, but its color is changed.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids contain 0 (white) and 1 (blue) pixels.
  - observation: Output grids contain 0 (white) and 2 (red) pixels.
  - observation: The output grid is always taller than the input grid.
  - observation: Output height increase in one row.
  - relationship: The blue (1) pixels in the input correspond to the red (2) pixels in the output.
  - action: Color substitution: Blue (1) is replaced by Red (2).
  - action: height increase: a copy of last line of original transformation is added to the bottom.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  **If** the cell's value is 0 (white), keep it as 0 (white) in the output grid.
3.  **If** the cell's value is 1 (blue), change it to 2 (red) in the output grid.
4.  Copy the content of last generated row to a new row.
5. **Append** this new row at the bottom of output grid.
