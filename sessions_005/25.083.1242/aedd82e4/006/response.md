Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program correctly identified the basic rule of changing a red pixel adjacent to a white pixel to blue. However, it fails in cases with multiple candidate red pixels and white pixels, specifically in determining *which* red pixel to transform when multiple choices exist, and which red pixel adjacent to *which* white pixel to transform. The current selection logic (bottom-rightmost) is not always consistent with the expected outputs. Example 2 clearly shows it is picking one red pixel when it looks like it should be picking two. Example 3 looks like an error in the expected output - lets look into that.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Examples in Detail:** Carefully examine each example, paying close attention to the input, expected output, and the actual output of the current code. This will reveal specific scenarios where the current logic fails.
2.  **Refine Selection Criteria:** The "bottom-rightmost" rule is insufficient. We need to revise the criteria for choosing the target red pixel. The updated rule needs to account for all training examples correctly. The main issue is that *more than one* red pixel can change in each example.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe the refined transformation rule.

**Gather Metrics and Analyze Examples:**

Let's analyze the provided examples to gather more precise information about the errors:


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)
    transformed_output = np.array(transformed_output)

    diff = np.where(expected_output != transformed_output)
    diff_coords = list(zip(diff[0], diff[1]))

    print(f"  Differences at coordinates: {diff_coords}")

    # Find red and white pixels in input
    red_pixels = np.argwhere(input_grid == 2)
    white_pixels = np.argwhere(input_grid == 0)
    print(f"  Red pixels in input: {red_pixels.tolist()}")
    print(f"  White pixels in input: {white_pixels.tolist()}")
    changed_to_blue = np.argwhere(transformed_output == 1)
    print(f"  Blue pixels in transformed: {changed_to_blue.tolist()}")
    expected_blue = np.argwhere(expected_output == 1)
    print(f"  Blue pixels in expected: {expected_blue.tolist()}")


examples = [
    {
        "input": [[0, 2, 2], [0, 2, 2], [2, 0, 0]],
        "expected": [[0, 2, 2], [0, 2, 2], [1, 0, 0]],
        "transformed": [[0, 2, 2], [0, 2, 2], [1, 0, 0]]
    },
    {
        "input": [[2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0, 0]],
        "expected": [[2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0]],

        "expected": [[2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2]],
        "transformed": [[2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 1]]
    },
    {
       "input": [[2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0]],
        "expected": [[2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]],
        "transformed": [[2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0]]
    }
]

for i, example in enumerate(examples):
    print(f"Example {i + 1}:")
    analyze_example(example["input"], example["expected"], example["transformed"])

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - color: red
    value: 2
    role: source
    properties:
      - can_change: true
      - change_condition: adjacent_to_white

  - color: white
    value: 0
    role: trigger
    properties:
      - can_change: false

  - color: blue
    value: 1
    role: result
    properties:
      - original_color: red

actions:
  - name: transform_red_to_blue
    condition: red_pixel_adjacent_to_white_pixel
    selection: all_applicable # all red pixels next to white get changed
    result: change_color
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Object Identification:** Identify all red (value 2) and white (value 0) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Adjacency Check:** For *every* red pixel, check if it is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to at least one white pixel.

3.  **Transformation:** If a red pixel is adjacent to any white pixel, change its color to blue (value 1). There is no prioritization; *all* red pixels meeting the adjacency condition are transformed.

4.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.
