Okay, here's a breakdown of the results and a plan to improve the natural language program and, consequently, the code.

**General Assessment:**

The code performs well on examples 1 and 3 but fails on example 2. The primary issue seems to be how the code determines the width of the output and how it places objects when they are not directly adjacent, as seen in the second example. The second example has two non-blue pixel groups, which are not directly side by side, but one pixel apart, so the shapes must be identified separately and placed in separate columns, stacked vertically.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Object Identification:** The current object identification (using DFS) is mostly correct. However, it needs a clearer definition of what constitutes a unique object in the context of this task. It seems we want to extract distinct groups of contiguous pixels.

2.  **Revisit Output Grid Dimensions:** The code assumes it stacks objects based solely on object heights, without correctly spacing those objects in the new output grid. The horizontal positioning is incorrect in example 2. We must ensure the new output grid contains each shape in the right place.

3. **Natural language adjustments**:
    *   Define "object" to consider diagonal connections.
    *   Ensure the program accounts for spacing between objects horizontally.

**Metrics and Observations (using code for verification where needed):**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify and Separate Objects:** Scan the input grid. Identify distinct groups of contiguous non-blue pixels (pixels with values other than 1). Consider pixels adjacent horizontally or vertically as part of the same group. Each of those group will be one object.
2.  **Remove Background:** Remove all blue pixels (value 1).
3. **Arrange Objects:** Create a new grid. The height is the sum of the height of each object. The width should be the maximum width of all object.
4.  **Populate Output:** Place each extracted object into the output grid. Stack the object vertically. The objects should be arranged in their original horizontal order, relative to each other, padded by empty (value 0) columns where necessary to reflect their original separation.
5.  **Iterate:** Continue placing object until there are no more groups.
