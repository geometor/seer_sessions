objects:
  - description: "Contiguous regions of non-blue (non-1) pixels."
    properties:
      - color: "Varies, excluding blue (1)."
      - connectivity: "Pixels are adjacent horizontally or vertically."
      - bounding_box: "Smallest rectangle enclosing the object."
    actions:
      - "Identify and separate each object."
      - "Determine bounding box for each object."

transformations:
  - description: "Stack objects vertically while maintaining relative horizontal positioning"
  - steps:
      - "Remove blue pixels (value 1), acting as separators."
      - "Objects positions adjusted to stack vertically using bounding box height"
      - preserve relative column of each object based on the bounding boxes min_col
