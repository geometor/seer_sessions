"""
1.  **Identify and Separate Objects:** Scan the input grid. Identify distinct groups of contiguous non-blue pixels (pixels with values other than 1). Consider pixels adjacent horizontally or vertically as part of the same group. Each of those group will be one object.
2.  **Remove Background:** Remove all blue pixels (value 1).
3. **Arrange Objects:** Create a new grid. The height is the sum of the height of each object. The width should be the maximum width of all object.
4.  **Populate Output:** Place each extracted object into the output grid. Stack the object vertically. The objects should be arranged in their original horizontal order, relative to each other, padded by empty (value 0) columns where necessary to reflect their original separation.
5.  **Iterate:** Continue placing object until there are no more groups.
