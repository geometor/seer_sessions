```python
"""
1.  **Identify Input Regions:** Divide the input grid into two 3x3 regions: a top region and a bottom region.
2.  **Focus on Top Region:** Consider only the top 3x3 region of the input grid.
3.  **Map Maroon to Red:** Within the top region, locate all pixels with the color maroon (9). Transform these pixels to the color red (2) in the output grid.
4.  **Map to white:** any color other than maroon(9), map to white(0).
5.  **Ignore Bottom Region:** The bottom region of the input does not influence the output.
6.  **Output:** Create a 3x3 output grid containing the transformed pixels.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program and code were based on a limited understanding from the first example. The subsequent tests reveal inconsistencies in how maroon (9) and other colors are mapped to red (2) and white (0). The core issue seems to be an incorrect mapping rule where it places the color '2' where there is a '9' and '0' everywhere else. It has to consider the position, we're misinterpreting the spatial relationships.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze each input-output pair, paying close attention to the position of maroon (9) pixels and their corresponding output.
2.  **Identify the Pattern:** The pattern is where the '9' and '2' are. Determine the exact rule governing the transformation.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the program description to reflect the accurate transformation rule.
4. **Prepare YAML data**: Create a YAML block summarizing the findings about objects, properties, and actions.

**Gather Metrics & Analysis (using code execution when beneficial):**

Let's use the output from previous code run as input here, we don't need to use `tool_code`.
I will reformat the results to analyze them.

*Example 1:*

*   Input: `[[0, 9, 9], [0, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1]]`
*   Expected: `[[2, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`
*   Actual: `[[0, 2, 2], [0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2]]`
*   Analysis: Maroon (9) in the top-left, should be red(2) in output. All the 9s are becoming 2s, where only certain 9s should.

*Example 2:*

*   Input: `[[9, 0, 9], [0, 9, 9], [0, 0, 9], [1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0]]`
*   Expected: `[[0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0]]`
*   Actual: `[[2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 2]]`
*   Analysis: Maroon(9) at top middle should be red(2) on bottom middle

*Example 3:*

*   Input: `[[0, 9, 0], [9, 0, 9], [9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0]]`
*   Expected: `[[2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2]]`
*   Actual:   `[[0, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2], [2, 0, 0]]`
*   Analysis: Maroon(9) appears in a cross pattern, and so does red(2)

*Example 4:*

*   Input: `[[0, 0, 9], [9, 9, 9], [0, 9, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1]]`
*   Expected: `[[0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0]]`
*   Actual: `[[0, 0, 2], [2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 0]]`
*    Analysis: Again, the 9 maps to 2

*Example 5:*

*   Input: `[[0, 9, 0], [0, 9, 9], [0, 9, 9], [0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1]]`
*   Expected: `[[2, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`
*   Actual: `[[0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2], [0, 2, 2]]`
*   Analysis: 9 maps to 2.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
observations:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - contains_colors: [0, 1, 9]
      - size: variable (up to 6x3 in examples)

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - contains_colors: [0, 2]
      - size: 3x3
      - transformation_rule: |
          The output grid is a 3x3 grid.
          Maroon (9) pixels in the input grid are mapped to red (2)
          in the output grid. The location of red(2) in the
          output is determined by swapping around the values.
          All other input pixels, regardless of the input color,
          are mapped to white (0).

  - action: color_mapping
    details:
      - from: 9
        to: 2
      - from: other
        to: 0
  - action: spatial_mapping
    details:
      - The position in input maps one to one with position in output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A grid of any size containing pixel values representing colors.
2.  **Output:** Create a 3x3 output grid.
3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    *   Identify all pixels with color maroon (9) in the *input* grid.
    *   For each maroon pixel found, set the pixel at the same x,y coordinate in the output grid to color red (2).
    *   Set all other pixels in the output grid to white (0), regardless of color in the input.
