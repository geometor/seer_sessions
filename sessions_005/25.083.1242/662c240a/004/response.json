            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the information and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis (selecting the first 3x3 block) was too simplistic. While it worked for the fourth example, it failed for the first three. The core issue is that the selection logic for the 3x3 block is incorrect. The current code always picks the top block, but the correct block varies across examples. We need to determine *which* of the three 3x3 blocks is the correct output, based on properties of those blocks.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Correct Output Block:** For each example, determine which of the three 3x3 blocks corresponds to the expected output.\n2.  **Analyze Block Properties:** Once we know *which* block is correct, we need to figure out *why*. We'll look for distinguishing properties of the correct blocks versus the incorrect ones. This might involve color distribution, unique colors, patterns, or relationships between the blocks.\n3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program to reflect the discovered selection rule.\n4. Iterate: Run this updated natural language description on future iterations to develop code that selects the correct block.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nI need to programmatically determine which block (top, middle, or bottom) is the correct output for each example.\n\n"
