The transformation appears to involve replacing certain digits with zeros based on their surrounding neighbors, suggesting a local pattern-matching or filtering operation. The specific digits being replaced and the conditions for replacement vary, but it seems that pixels surrounded by other colors, or at the edges of blocks of same color, are being zeroed.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
