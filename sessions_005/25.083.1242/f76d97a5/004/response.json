            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code attempted to generalize rules from the first example, but it clearly failed to capture the complete logic, as evidenced by the mismatches in Examples 2 and 3. The code is too specific to certain color combinations (e.g., 4 and 5, 5 and 6, 9 and 5) and doesn't abstract the underlying principles correctly.  It seems to be partially picking up on concepts like adjacency, edge detection, and object identification, but it's applying them inconsistently and incompletely. The strategy needs to shift from hardcoding color-specific rules to identifying more generalizable patterns based on object properties, relative positions, and neighborhood analysis.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze *all* provided examples, not just the first one.  Look for common patterns and differences between how objects of different colors are treated.\n2.  **Abstract Away from Specific Colors:** Instead of focusing on \"color 4 does X\", think about \"objects of color A adjacent to objects of color B are transformed in manner C\".\n3.  **Refine Object Properties:** The current object identification is basic. We need to consider:\n    *   **Shape:** Are there any clues related to the shape of an object?\n    *   **Size:** Does the size of an object influence the transformation?\n    *   **Connectivity:** Are there specific rules about how objects connect (or don't connect)?\n    *   **Relative Position:** Consider positions relative to the *entire grid* (edges, corners, center) and *other objects*.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** The natural language program and the code should be developed iteratively.  After each code revision, ALL examples should be tested.\n5.  **Diagonal handling:** The initial attempt at diagonal logic is likely too simplistic. Need to carefully review how diagonals work, and IF they are unique to example three.\n\n**Gathering Metrics:**\n\nI need to analyze the grids, the errors, and the expected outputs in more detail. I will use `tool_code` to get quantitative data. This is the most important step before rewriting code.\n\n"
