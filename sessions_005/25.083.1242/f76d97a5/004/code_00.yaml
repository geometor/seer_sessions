        result: becomes 0 if on edge and adjacent to 5, otherwise remains 4
      - color: 5
        shape: contiguous block
        adjacent_to: [4]
        result: Becomes 4 if adjacent to 4, otherwise becomes 0.

  - example_id: 2
    objects:
      - color: 6
        shape: contiguous block
        adjacent_to: [5, 0] # Includes edge (color 0 by default)
        result: becomes 0 if on the edge or if adjacent to 0
      - color: 5
        shape: contiguous block
        adjacent_to: [6, 0]
        result: becomes 6 when isolated and adjacent to 6, becomes 0 if adjacent to 0 or on edge

       - from: 6 # Edge object,

  - example_id: 3
    objects:
      - color: 9
        shape: contiguous block, occupies edges and diagonals
        adjacent_to: [5, 0] #edge is implicit 0
        result: becomes 0 if on edge or on either diagonal
      - color: 5
        shape: single pixels, small clusters
        adjacent_to: [9]
        result: becomes 9 if adjacent to 9
