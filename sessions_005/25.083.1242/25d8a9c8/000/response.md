Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another grid of the same dimensions. The output grids seem to consist primarily of `0` (white) and `5` (gray) values. The transformation doesn't appear to involve complex spatial manipulations or geometric transformations. Instead, it seems to be a direct mapping of some kind, based on rows of matching values in input grid.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: Output grids contain only values 0 and 5.
  - observation: Input grids contain varying single-digit integers (0-9).
  - relationship: Rows that have all elements the same in the input change to 5 in the output.
  - relationship: Rows that have different elements in the input change to 0 in the output.
  - property: The transformation is applied row-wise.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.
2.  **Check** if all values within the current row are identical.
3.  **If** all values in the row are the same, **then** set all values in the corresponding output row to `5` (gray).
4.  **Else**, set all values in the corresponding output row to `0` (white).
5.  **Return** the modified grid.
