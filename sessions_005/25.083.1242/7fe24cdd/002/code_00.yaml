facts:
  - observation: Input grids are replicated and placed into six regions in the output grid.
  - observation: Output grid dimensions are twice the input height and three times the input width.
  - observation: Pixel swapping occurs within each of the six regions.
  - observation: The swapping pattern is consistent across all regions and examples.
  - observation: Current swapping logic is based on an incorrect offset and needs revision.
  - input_grid_dimensions: 3x3
  - output_grid_dimensions: 6x9
  - num_regions: 6
  - region_arrangement: 2 rows x 3 columns
  - region_size: Same as input grid (3x3)
