facts:
  - observation: Input grids are smaller than output grids.
  - observation: Output grids exhibit a repeating, tiled pattern.
  - observation: All input pixel colors are present in the output.
  - observation: input grid dimensions are 3x3
  - observation: output grid dimensions appear to be 6 x 6 (input grid dimensions doubled)
  - relationship: Input pixel values seem to map to specific positions in the output grid but with some swaps of pixels.
  - pattern: the output appears to consist of 6 copies of the input arranged in a 2 x 3 tiled pattern
  - transformation: Pixel pairs appear to have been swapped
