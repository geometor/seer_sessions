task: "Replicate and Permute"
input_grid:
  type: "2D array"
  elements: "integers (0-9 representing colors)"
output_grid:
  type: "2D array"
  dimensions: "twice the height and three times the width of the input grid"
  regions:
    number: 6
    arrangement: "2x3 grid"
    size: "same as input grid"
transformation:
  type: "replication and permutation"
  steps:
    - replicate_input:
        description: "Copy input grid to each of the 6 regions."
    - permute_within_region:
        description: "Apply a specific cyclic permutation within each region."
