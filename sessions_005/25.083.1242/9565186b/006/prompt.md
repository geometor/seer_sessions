Iterates through each row of the input grid. For each row, it checks if any cells
contain the colors 1 (blue), 2 (red), 3 (green), or 8 (azure). If a row contains
any of these colors, all cells in that entire row of the output grid are changed
to 5 (gray), unless that cell has a colour not in the trigger colours. If the
row does not contain the trigger colors, the entire row is copied unchanged
from the input grid to the output grid.
