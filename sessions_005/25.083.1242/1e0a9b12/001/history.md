Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The transformation seems to involve rearranging and potentially deleting certain elements based on their spatial position and color, specifically focusing on non-zero elements. There appears to be some kind of downward movement or stacking of non-zero elements, with zeros filling in the upper rows that are left vacant.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2D
      - elements: integers (0-9)
      - color_representation:
          0: white
          1: blue
          2: red
          3: green
          4: yellow
          5: gray
          6: magenta
          7: orange
          8: azure
          9: maroon
  - type: pixel
    properties:
        - value: integer (0-9)
        - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: move_down
    description: Non-zero pixels move down to the lowest available rows, maintaining their original column order.

  - name: fill_zeros
    description: Empty spaces left by moved pixels are filled with zeros.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Elements are arranged in a 2D grid, position and adjacency are important.
  - type: ordinal
    description: The relative column order of non-zero pixels is maintained during movement.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Scan the input grid and locate all pixels with values other than 0.
2.  **Maintain Column Order:** For each column, preserve the vertical sequence of non-zero pixels found.
3.  **Stack Downwards:** Move the non-zero pixels downwards within their respective columns, stacking them at the bottom of the grid.
4.  **Fill with Zeros:** Fill any remaining empty cells (those above the stacked non-zero pixels) with zeros.

In more concise wording:

Iterate through each column. Collect all non-zero elements, preserving their original order. Place these collected elements at the bottom of their respective columns in the output grid. Finally fill all remaining empty cells with zeros.
