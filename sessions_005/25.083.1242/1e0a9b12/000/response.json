The transformation seems to involve rearranging and potentially deleting certain elements based on their spatial position and color, specifically focusing on non-zero elements. There appears to be some kind of downward movement or stacking of non-zero elements, with zeros filling in the upper rows that are left vacant.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
