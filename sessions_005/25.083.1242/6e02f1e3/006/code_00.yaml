facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: number of rows (3 in all examples)
      columns: number of columns (3 in all examples)
      cells: individual elements of the grid, represented by colors (0-9)
    relations:
      row_identity: checks if all rows are identical
      main_diagonal: checks for a top-left to bottom-right diagonal with the same color
      anti_diagonal: checks for a top-right to bottom-left diagonal with the same color

  - action: transform
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    rules:
      - condition: all rows are identical
        action: set the first row of the output_grid to gray (5), and all other cells to white (0)
      - condition: rows are not identical AND a main diagonal exists
        action: set the main diagonal of the output_grid to gray (5), and all other cells to white (0)
      - condition: rows are not identical AND NO main diagonal exists AND an anti-diagonal exists
        action: set the anti-diagonal of the output_grid to gray (5), and all other cells to white(0)
      - condition: rows are different AND NO main diagonal exists AND NO anti-diagonal exists
        action: set the main diagonal of output grid to grey(5), and all other cells to white(0)
