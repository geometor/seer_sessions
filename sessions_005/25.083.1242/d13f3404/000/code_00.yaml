facts:
  - observation: "Input grids are smaller than output grids."
  - observation: "Input grids contain a pattern of non-zero colored pixels surrounded by zero-valued (white) pixels."
  - observation: "Output grids replicate the input pattern diagonally."
  - observation: "The output pattern extends downwards and to the right."
  - observation: "The output grid's dimensions are larger, specifically, rows and columns added seem related to original size."
  - relationship: "Output size is related to the input size, output row count is input row count plus input column count minus 1, ditto for columns."
