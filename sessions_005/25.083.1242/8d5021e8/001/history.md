Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input:** The input is a small 2D grid (matrix) of digits, where each digit presumably represents a color. The input grids seem to be consistently 3x2.
*   **Output:** The output is a larger 2D grid, also of color digits. The output grids are 9x4, which is exactly three time bigger in hight and 2 times in width of the input grid.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve some form of replication or expansion of the input grid, with a specific pattern in how the input elements are arranged in the output. It is also notable, that the input grid is present in the output. The input pixels are arranged in such manner to form 2 by 2 squares.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are 3x2.
  - observation: Output grids are 9x4.
  - observation: Digits in the grids represent colors.
  - observation: The transformation involves replication of input pixels.
  - observation: replicated pixels for a 2x2 square.
  - observation: Each input cell maps to 2x2 block within the output cell.
  - observation: There is a certain layout, where the input is sort of repeated on output.
  - relationship: Output grid height is 3 times the input grid height.
  - relationship: Output grid width is 2 times the input grid width.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that is three times the height and two times the width of the input grid.
2.  **Expansion and Placement:** Iterate through each cell in the input grid. For each cell (with color *c* at position *i*, *j*):
    *   Replicate the cell as 2 x 2 square.
    *  Determine top left corner location of each 2x2 square by multiplying original coordinates by 2 and using formula: *x=2\*j*, *y=2\*i*.
    *  Fill the cells to create a 2x2 block in the output grid.
3.  **Output:** The resulting output grid is the transformed version of the input grid.

Essentially the transformation is building a grid where the input grid is sort of repeated 2x2, so there is always 4 pixels of the same color in the output.
