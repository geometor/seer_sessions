```python
"""
The transformation expands the input grid to an output grid that is three times the height and two times the width. Each cell in the input grid is replicated as a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid. The positioning of these 2x2 blocks follows a pattern derived from the input cell's original coordinates, scaled by a factor of 2 for x, y coordinates.

Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved expanding the input grid. However, it's clear from the subsequent examples that the transformation isn't a simple expansion or replication. The code incorrectly assumes a fixed expansion factor (2x2 blocks) and doesn't correctly map the input pixels to the output. The "Pixels Off" metric in the results indicates significant discrepancies between the expected and transformed outputs, meaning the core logic needs revision. The strategy should shift from assuming a fixed expansion to identifying the pattern of how input cells relate to output cells across all provided examples. It seems like mirroring and alternation are at play, but not simple block replication.

**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code execution when necessary):**

Let's analyze each example individually to pinpoint the transformation rule.

*   **Example 1:**

    *   Input: 3x2 (height x width)
    *   Output: 9x4
    *   Input cells seem to get interleaved and mirrored.
*   **Example 2:**

    *   Input: 3x2
    *   Output: 9x4
    *   Similar interleaving/mirroring as example 1.
*   **Example 3:**

    *   Input: 3x2
    *   Output: 9x4
    *    Same pattern.

**YAML Block:**

observations:
  - example: 1
    input_shape: [3, 2]
    output_shape: [9, 4]
    objects:
      - description: Input grid
        properties:
          - height: 3
          - width: 2
      - description: Output grid
        properties:
          - height: 9
          - width: 4
    actions:
      - description: The input grid is transformed into the output grid.
        details: The output grid's height is three times the input's height, and the width is two times the input's width. The transformation appears to involve interleaving and mirroring of the input grid cells rather than simple block replication. Specifically each row seems to be constructed by reversing the sequence of the row and interleaveing it. Each row is repeated.

    input_shape: [3, 2]

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** The output grid's height is three times the input grid's height, and the width is twice the input grid's width.

2.  **Iterate through Input Rows:** For each row in the input grid:

    a. **Reverse and Interleave:** Create a new sequence by reversing the original row and interleaving the elements. For example, if a row is `[A, B]`, the reversed sequence is `[B, A]`. The interleaved output is created by placing items from the reversed sequence in between items from the original, resulting in `[A, B, B, A]`.

    b. **Repeat and Populate Output:** Create three copies of the interleaved row. Stack two copies on top of each other and then a third, and use these to populate three consecutive rows in the output grid, starting at the row index corresponding to three times the current input row index.

3. **Populate Black Rows** Fill every third output row with zeros (black), after populating with transformed rows.
