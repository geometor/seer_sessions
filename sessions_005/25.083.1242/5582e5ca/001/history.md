## train_1

**input:**
```
4 4 8
6 4 3
6 3 0
```


**output:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 4
4 4 4
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
6 8 9
1 8 1
9 4 9
```


**output:**
```
9 9 9
9 9 9
9 9 9
```


## train_3

**input:**
```
4 6 9
6 4 1

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, aiming to discern the transformation logic and express it in a structured way:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another 3x3 grid. The output grid always consists of a single, repeating digit. The key seems to lie in identifying which digit from the input grid becomes the repeating digit in the output grid. There is no obvious arithmetic or geometric relationship between the input values and repeated output values. It seems related to the position or characteristics of the digits, not the specific value.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
input_grid_dimensions: 3x3
output_grid_dimensions: 3x3
elements:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of single-digit integers (0-9)
  - type: cell
    description: individual element within the grid, representing a color
  - type: operation
    description: select a digit from the imput grid
    properties:
       selection criteria: unknown
  - type: operation
     description: fill all the cells in a new grid with the same dimensions as the original grid with the selected digit
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine** the input 3x3 grid.
2.  **Select** the value from the center cell in the input grid.
3. **Create** a new output grid with the same dimensions.
4.  **Fill** all cells of the output grid with the selected value.
