Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output examples to discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into a smaller grid. The output grid seems to be composed of the non-zero values from the input grid, and the dimensions of output grid appear related to the quantity of the non-zero color in input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**

  - output_grid_dimensions: variable

objects:
  - train_1:
    input_object:
      color: blue
      count: 2
      positions: [(1,0), (2,1)]
    output_object:
       color: blue
       count: 2
       shape: 1x2
  - train_2:
    input_object:
      color: red
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,1), (1,0), (2,1)]
    output_object:
      color: red
      count: 3
      shape: 1x3
  - train_3:
      input_object:
        color: orange
        count: 1
        positions: [(0,1)]
      output_object:
        color: orange
        count: 1
        shape: 1x1
  - train_4:
      input_object:
        color: azure
        count: 4
        positions: [(0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0)]
      output_object:
        color: azure
        count: 4
        shape: 1x4

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single non-zero color present in the input grid.
2.  Count the number of times this color appears in the input grid.
3.  Create an output grid that is 1 row high, with width equal the count from step 2.
4. Fill all cells output grid with the identified non-zero color.

Essentially, the transformation extracts the non-zero color, counts its occurrences, and creates a 1-dimensional array of that color with a length equal to the count.
