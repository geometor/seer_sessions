Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and determine the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
*   The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the elements within the grid, specifically a mirroring or rotation. It's not a simple color substitution.
*   Visual inspection suggests that the output is a mirrored version of input along the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - elements: integers (0-9)
      - representation: colors

actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: rearrangement of grid elements
    mechanism: mirroring along the main diagonal (transposition)

relationships:
  - type: input-output
    description: output grid is a transformed version of the input grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  The output grid is obtained by transposing the input grid.
2.  Transposing means swapping rows and columns, or, equivalently, mirroring the grid along its main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right).
3.  Element (i, j) in the input grid becomes element (j, i) in the output grid.

Essentially, the output grid's rows are the input grid's columns, and vice versa.
