The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple arithmetic or overall color changes. Instead, it appears to be a rearrangement of the columns based on their color compositions, perhaps sorting or reordering. There's no obvious mirroring, rotation, or reflection. The core challenge lies in figuring out the *rule* governing column rearrangement. The spatial arrangement *within* each column might also be significant (e.g. train_4).\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

I will need to examine more examples, especially contrasting ones, to deduce this rule with certainty. I suspect more examples, combined with experimentation using a `tool_code` block in later stages, will help me refine this program into a precise algorithm.\n"
