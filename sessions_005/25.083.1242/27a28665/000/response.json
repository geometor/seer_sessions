Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs are 3x3 grids.\n*   Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing a color.\n*   The outputs are single-digit integers.\n*   It appears that the output integer is related to the *count* of some specific arrangement of colored pixels within the input grid. The arrangement is consistently present on the diagonals and, when present, it forms an \"X\".\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
