observations:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
    size: variable (from examples, all are 3x3, but this might not always be the case)

  - pattern: "Count"
    description: The output is a count of specific 3x3 patterns within the input grid. The definition of the pattern needs re-evaluation.
    current_rule: >
      The current code tries to identify "X" shapes but fails.
      The conditions are too strict.

  - example_analysis:
    - example_1:
        input: [[5, 5, 0], [5, 0, 5], [0, 5, 0]]
        expected_output: 1
        notes: "Diagonals are not all the same."
    - example_2:
        input: [[8, 0, 8], [0, 8, 0], [8, 0, 8]]
        expected_output: 2
        notes: "Seems to fit classic 'X' definition.  The central value is not 0, it is ok for it to be the same as the corners."
    - example_3:
        input:  [[5, 0, 5], [0, 5, 0], [5, 0, 5]]
        expected_output: 2
        notes:  "Seems to fit classic 'X' definition, central is different, and the edges do not need to be zero."
    - example_4:
      input: [[0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0]]
      expected_output: 3
      notes: "This does *not* seem to match a classic X-pattern, there may be multiple objects here, it may involve counting corners."
    - example_5:
        input: [[0, 8, 8], [0, 8, 8], [8, 0, 0]]
        expected_output: 3
        notes: "Same note as above."
    - example_6:
      input: [[4, 4, 0], [4, 0, 4], [0, 4, 0]]
      expected_output: 1
      notes: "Does not fit a strict X rule."
    - example_7:
        input: [[0, 5, 0], [5, 5, 5], [0, 5, 0]]
        expected_output: 6
        notes: "All cells are the same color - should this be an X?  It is not according to the is_x function, but the count implies it might be.  It's more likely that corners are being counted."
