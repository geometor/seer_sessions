Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The initial transformation rule, derived from the first example, works correctly only for that specific 2x2 input. The subsequent examples reveal that the bottom-right quadrant's transformation isn't a simple diagonal flip. There's a more complex pattern, specifically related to how the last column is handled in cases where input grid columns > 2. The second and third examples help highlight this issue.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the differences between the *Expected Output* and the *Transformed Output* for examples 2 and 3. Focus on the bottom-right quadrant, where the errors occur. The right-most column in this quandrant will offer the best clue.
2.  **Refine Bottom-Right Rule:** Develop a more precise rule for the bottom-right quadrant that accounts for the observed pattern, especially concerning column-specific color changes.
3. Update natural language and yaml documenting.

**Gather Metrics:**

Here's a summary of information, not using `tool_code` because the provided information is sufficient:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (2, 2)
    *   Output Shape: (4, 4)
    *   Match: True
    *   Pixels Off: 0
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Output Shape: (6, 6)
    *   Match: False
    *   Pixels Off: 1
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Output Shape: (6, 6)
    *   Match: False
    *   Pixels Off: 8

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is transformed into a grid four times its size (2x height and 2x width).
  - quadrant_rules:
      - top_left: |
          The top-left quadrant of the output grid is identical to the input grid.
      - top_right: |
          The top-right quadrant is a horizontal mirror image of the input grid (flipped along the vertical axis).
      - bottom_left: |
          The bottom-left quadrant is a vertical mirror image of the input grid (flipped along the horizontal axis).
      - bottom_right: |
          The bottom-right quadrant is initially a diagonal mirror image of the input grid (flipped along both axes). The modification then: replaces the last column colors of the bottom_right quadrant.
  - bottom_right_column_modification: |
      if width >=3, The colors from the last column of top_right are used to update values in the last column of bottom right except last row.
  - object_interaction: "None. All quadrants use copies of the source, no feedback."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Create Output Grid:** Double the dimensions of the input grid to create an output grid.
2.  **Populate Top-Left:** Copy the original input grid to the top-left quadrant of the output grid.
3.  **Populate Top-Right:** Create a horizontally mirrored version of the input grid and place it in the top-right quadrant.
4.  **Populate Bottom-Left:** Create a vertically mirrored version of the input grid and place it in the bottom-left quadrant.
5.  **Populate Bottom-Right:** Create a diagonally mirrored version of the input grid (equivalent to flipping both horizontally and vertically) and place it in the bottom-right quadrant.
6. **Modify the last column**: If the input width is greater than or equal to 3, then copy the last column of the top right quadrant, except its last pixel, to the last column of the bottom right quadrant.
