            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial transformation rule, derived from the first example, works correctly only for that specific 2x2 input. The subsequent examples reveal that the bottom-right quadrant's transformation isn't a simple diagonal flip. There's a more complex pattern, specifically related to how the last column is handled in cases where input grid columns > 2. The second and third examples help highlight this issue.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the differences between the *Expected Output* and the *Transformed Output* for examples 2 and 3. Focus on the bottom-right quadrant, where the errors occur. The right-most column in this quandrant will offer the best clue.\n2.  **Refine Bottom-Right Rule:** Develop a more precise rule for the bottom-right quadrant that accounts for the observed pattern, especially concerning column-specific color changes.\n3. Update natural language and yaml documenting.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nHere's a summary of information, not using `tool_code` because the provided information is sufficient:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (2, 2)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Match: True\n    *   Pixels Off: 0\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (6, 6)\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Pixels Off: 1\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (6, 6)\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Pixels Off: 8\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
