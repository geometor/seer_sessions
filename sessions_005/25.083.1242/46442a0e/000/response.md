Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits.
*   The digits seem to represent colors (based on the ARC-AGI context).
*   The output grids are larger than the input grids, suggesting some form of expansion or replication.
*   The output grids appear to have a symmetrical or patterned structure, potentially related to the input grid.
*   The patterns seem to alternate parts of the original input.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: variable
      - elements: digits (0-9, representing colors)
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: larger than input_grid, potentially multiples
      - elements: digits (0-9), mirroring input_grid elements in a pattern

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: The input grid is expanded to a larger size.
  - name: replicate
    description: Elements or sections of the input grid are copied and arranged in the output grid.
  - name: alternate
    description: sections from input grid are flipped and alternated

relationships:
  - input_grid elements are contained within output_grid elements, arranged in a specific pattern.
  - output_grid dimensions are related to input_grid dimensions, probably by duplication/expansion.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observe** the input grid.
2.  **Double** both dimensions (height and width) of the original to get the new output grid.
3. **Flip** the order of the rows of the original.
4. **Concatenate** the original input rows with the flipped input rows to create the columns of the output.
5. **Repeat** the concatenated rows, using original dimensions, doubled.

I'll now summarize a concise description of the complete transformation:

The transformation takes the input grid, doubles it dimensions, flips the rows to create new rows and builds the output grid by concatenating the new rows with the original rows, doubling the number of times the rows are repeated to match the new dimensions.
