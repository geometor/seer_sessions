Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits.\n*   The digits seem to represent colors (based on the ARC-AGI context).\n*   The output grids are larger than the input grids, suggesting some form of expansion or replication.\n*   The output grids appear to have a symmetrical or patterned structure, potentially related to the input grid.\n*   The patterns seem to alternate parts of the original input.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
