The input grids are transformed into output grids of the same dimensions. The primary change seems to be the replacement of certain colors (represented by digits) with the color gray (represented by the digit 5). The color being replaced appears context dependent. There's no obvious size change, rotation, or mirroring.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
