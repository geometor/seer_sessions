## train_1

**input:**
```
1 8 8 7 7 8
1 1 7 7 1 8
7 1 1 7 7 8
```


**output:**
```
1 8 8 5 5 8
1 1 5 5 1 8
5 1 1 5 5 8
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
7 7 7 1
1 8 1 7
7 1 1 7
```


**output:**
```
5 5 5 1
1 8 1 5
5 1 1 5
```


## train_3

**input:**
```
1 8 1 7 1
7 8 8 1 1
7 1 8 8 7
```


**output:**
```
1 8 1 5 1
5 8 8 1 1
5 1 8 8 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers, where each integer represents a color. The input grids are transformed into output grids of the same dimensions. The primary change seems to be the replacement of certain colors (represented by digits) with the color gray (represented by the digit 5). The color being replaced appears context dependent. There's no obvious size change, rotation, or mirroring.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
observations:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - type: color_change
    description: Certain colors in the input grid are replaced by the color gray (5) in the output grid.
  - type: object
    description: the objects are the contiguous blocks of the same color, but this is not obviously useful.

  - type: color_replacement_pattern
    description:  The colors 7 (orange) is replaced by the color 5 (gray)
    conditions:
      - the color 7 (orange) is on the edge
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  **Check** if the color in the cell is orange (7)
3. **Check** for edge: if an orange cell touches the edge of the grid.
4.  **Replace**: If an orange cell is on an edge, then change it to gray (5).
5.  **Preserve all others**: All other cells retain their original colors.
