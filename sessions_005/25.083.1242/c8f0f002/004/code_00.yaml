task: 05f2a901
examples:
  - input_objects:
      - object_1:
          color: orange
          shape: irregular
          boundary: "pixels with value 7 on perimeter"
      - object_2:
          color: mixed
          shape: fills remaining space
          boundary: "pixels adjacent to object_1, and grid edges"
    output_objects:
      - object_1:
            color: gray
            shape: "same shape as input object_1"
            boundary: "pixels that were orange and on perimeter in input"
      - object_2:
          color: mixed
          shape: fills remaining space
          boundary: "pixels adjacent to object_1, and grid edges"

    transformations:
        - change color of objects on perimeter from orange to gray
