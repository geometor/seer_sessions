description: Change the color of specific pixels on the grid edge.
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: variable
      cols: variable
      cells: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - name: pixel
    type: cell
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      row_index: integer
      col_index: integer
      is_edge: boolean
actions:
  - name: identify_edge_pixels
    input: grid
    output: set of pixel coordinates
    criteria: pixel is orange (7) AND located on the outer boundary of the grid (row index is 0 or rows-1, OR column index is 0 or cols-1)
  - name: change_color
    input: pixel, color
    output: modified pixel
    criteria: If a pixel is identified as an edge pixel, change its color to gray (5).
