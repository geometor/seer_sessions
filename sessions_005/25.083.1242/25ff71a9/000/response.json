The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The transformation seems to involve a vertical shift or rearrangement of rows within the grid. The colors (represented by the digits) present in the input are preserved in the output. The transformation rule might depend on the position of the non-zero rows.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
