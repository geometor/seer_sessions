It appears to be an expansion of the input grid. The original input grid's values are present in the output, but duplicated and surrounded by a border of '0' (white) pixels.  The expansion seems to involve both duplicating the input grid's rows and columns and adding a border.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Fill the outermost rows and columns of this new grid with '0' (white).
