However, it seems to be adding an *extra* layer of padding. The expected outputs show the border being integrated *within* the duplicated rows and columns, not added *around* them. The strategy will be to adjust the indexing when placing the duplicated grid into the output grid, ensuring the border occupies the correct space.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection, no code execution needed for this simple case):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (2, 2)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (6, 6) - Too large; extra padding.\n    *   The central 2x2 became 4x4 as expected, and the 0s should have been added into that expansion\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (2, 3)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (4, 6)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (6, 8) - Too large; extra padding.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (5, 6)\n    *    Actual Output Shape: (8,8)\n\n**YAML Fact Extraction:**\n\n"
