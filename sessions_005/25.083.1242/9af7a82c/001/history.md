Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and develop a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   The dimensions of the output grids are different from, and larger than, the input grids.
*   The output grids appear to be constructed by taking columns of the input, reversing order, and placing them as rows of the output.
*   Empty space is added at end of each row of the output.
* The number of rows in the output is not directly related to the columns in the input.
* The number of rows seems related to the width of the input.
*   Zeros (0, white) are used as padding to fill the output grid to reach the final size.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: "input"
    description: "A 2D grid of integers representing colors."
    properties:
      - width: "Variable, observed as 3, 4, and 3 in the examples."
      - height: "Variable, observed as 3, 3, and 4 in the examples."
      - elements: "Integers from 0 to 9, each representing a color."
  - type: "output"
    description: "A 2D grid of integers representing colors."
    properties:
      - width: same as input height
      - height: "input width + 2"
      - elements: "Integers from 0 to 9, each representing a color."
  - relation: "transformation"
    description: "The input grid is transformed into the output grid."
    rules:
      - columns_to_rows: "Input columns, reversed, are converted to rows in output."
      - padding: "Zeros (0) are added to the output grid to fill empty cells to make input_width + 2 rows."
      - width: input height becomes the width of output
      - height: number of rows in output is input width plus 2
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Determine the height and width of the input grid.
    * Create an output with height equal to the input width plus two and width equal to the input height

2.  **Column-to-Row Mapping:**
    *   Iterate through the columns of the input grid, from last to first.
    *   For each column:
        *   Copy the elements of the column into a new row in the output grid, starting from the top row.
        
3.  **Zero Padding:**
     * for each row of the copied columns, add zero to the end until we reach the number of output rows.

4. **Return**:
    * Return the output grid
