facts:
  - observation: Each pixel in the input grid is scaled up to a 2x2 block in the output grid.
  - observation: The arrangement of the 2x2 blocks in the output grid appears to be based on reflections of input coordinates around a diagonal
  - observation: The output appears to be created by reflecting, or mirroring, the scaled input around the central diagonals.
  - observation: The output grid is always twice the size of input grid in both dimensions.
