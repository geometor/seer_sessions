Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize for improvement.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial hypothesis, while capturing the scaling aspect, failed to correctly model the reflection and arrangement of the scaled-up pixels. The consistent "Pixels Off" values across all examples, along with "Size Correct", "Color Palette Correct", and "Color Count Correct" all being true, strongly suggests a systematic error in the placement logic, rather than issues with color manipulation or scaling itself. The core issue is how the 2x2 scaled blocks are positioned within the output grid relative to each other. The described "horizontal and vertical reflections" are not implemented correctly, leading to misplacement of large chunks of pixels.

My strategy is to:

1. **Re-examine the examples:** Visually inspect the input, expected output, and transformed output to identify the precise nature of the reflection/arrangement. I suspect the transformation rule is not as explained, and is simpler.
2. **Focus on block placement:**  The 2x2 scaling is correct. The core problem is *where* those blocks are going. I will pay close attention to the *relative* positions of colors in the input and output grids.
3. **Simplify the reflection logic:** The current code's reflection logic is overly complex and likely incorrect. I'll aim for a simpler, more direct mapping between input pixel coordinates and output block coordinates.
4. **Develop simple metrics to compare input and expected** to quantify the transformation and verify.

**Gathering Metrics**

I'll use a manual approach for visual comparison, combined with a summary. I don't see a need for `tool_code` here as the patterns are relatively simple to describe once understood.

**Example 1 Analysis**

*   **Input:**
    
```
    3 3 3
    0 2 2
    1 1 0
    ```

*   **Expected Output:**
    
```
    3 3 3 3 3 3
    0 2 2 2 2 0
    1 1 0 0 1 1
    1 1 0 0 1 1
    0 2 2 2 2 0
    3 3 3 3 3 3
    ```

*   **Transformed Output:**
    
```
    3 3 3 3 3 3
    3 3 3 3 3 3
    0 0 2 2 2 2
    0 0 2 2 2 2
    1 1 1 1 0 0
    1 1 1 1 0 0
    ```


Observations: The output is a mirrored version of the scaled input, but around the center diagonals. It almost appears to be a 90 degree rotation and then a scale up of the pixels.

**Example 2 Analysis**

*   **Input:**
    
```
    3 3 1
    1 3 0
    0 2 2
    ```

*   **Expected Output:**
    
```
    3 3 1 1 3 3
    1 3 0 0 3 1
    0 2 2 2 2 0
    0 2 2 2 2 0
    1 3 0 0 3 1
    3 3 1 1 3 3
    ```

* **Transformed Output:**
    
```
    3 3 3 3 1 1
    3 3 3 3 1 1
    1 1 3 3 0 0
    1 1 3 3 0 0
    0 0 2 2 2 2
    0 0 2 2 2 2
    ```

Observations: Similar to example 1, the result appears to a 90 degree rotation and then scale, with a mirroring effect.

**Example 3 Analysis**

*   **Input:**
    
```
    2 1 0
    0 2 3
    0 3 0
    ```

*   **Expected Output:**
    
```
    2 1 0 0 1 2
    0 2 3 3 2 0
    0 3 0 0 3 0
    0 3 0 0 3 0
    0 2 3 3 2 0
    2 1 0 0 1 2
    ```

*   **Transformed Output:**
    
```
    2 2 1 1 0 0
    2 2 1 1 0 0
    0 0 2 2 3 3
    0 0 2 2 3 3
    0 0 3 3 0 0
    0 0 3 3 0 0
    ```

Observations: The pattern observed before holds here too.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Each pixel in the input grid is scaled up to a 2x2 block in the output grid.
  - observation: The arrangement of the 2x2 blocks in the output grid appears to be based on reflections of input coordinates around a diagonal
  - observation: The output appears to be created by reflecting, or mirroring, the scaled input around the central diagonals.
  - observation: The output grid is always twice the size of input grid in both dimensions.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Scale:** Each pixel in the input grid is expanded into a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid.
2.  **Reflect:** The scaled-up input grid appears to be rotated by creating two mirrored images, a horizontal and a vertical. Imagine folding the scaled input in half vertically, creating a mirrored image of the scaled up pixels in the opposite side. Then, do the same by folding the input horizontally, creating a mirrored version in the bottom. The result is that the output grid can be considered as four quadrants, top-left: scaled original input, top-right: scaled vertical reflection of the input, bottom-left: scaled horizontal reflection, and bottom-right: the scaled horizontal and vertical reflection.

This revised natural language program focuses on the quadrant mirroring, which I believe more accurately captures the transformation.
