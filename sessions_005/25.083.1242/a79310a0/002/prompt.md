"""
Transforms the input grid by replacing an azure object with a red object of the same shape.
The position of the top-left corner of the shape is found by taking the row of the original top-left corner of the shape and taking the distance from that row to the nearest edge, and moving down that many spaces. If there are no rows, the object is placed at row=1.
The column of the top-left corner of the red shape is always in column 1.
