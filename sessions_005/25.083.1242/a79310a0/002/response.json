            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe code correctly identifies the azure object and attempts to replace it with a red object of the same shape. However, the placement of the new red object is consistently off. The initial strategy of using the distance to the nearest edge to determine the new row, and always placing the object in the first column, is not universally correct. The examples show that the new position might have a more complex rule. The core issue seems to be in the calculation of `new_row`.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine each example's input, expected output, and transformed output. Focus on the differences to pinpoint the exact error in positioning logic. Specifically calculate the intended `new_row` by comparing the expected and actual outcomes.\n2.  **Refine Positioning Rule:** Develop a more robust rule for determining the new position of the red object. Consider alternative relationships between the original azure object's position and the new red object's position. It appears we were calculating `new_row` incorrectly, and possibly the column as well, so look for other relationships that are consistent with expected outputs.\n3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Clearly articulate the revised transformation rule, incorporating the corrected positioning logic.\n4.  **Test and Iterate:** Generate the updated code based on the revised natural language program and repeat the testing process.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nLet's use code execution to calculate some metrics related to object positioning.\n\n"
