The input grids contain azure (8) and white (0) pixels, while the output grids contain red (2) and white (0) pixels. The key seems to be replacing a contiguous block of azure pixels with red pixels, maintaining the same shape and relative position, but shifting the position based on the location of the azure object in the input grid. The shape, width, height, and overall area (number of pixels) are changed.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

The position of the top-left corner of the shape is found by taking the row of the original top-left corner of the shape and taking the distance from that row to the nearest edge, and moving down that many spaces. If there are no rows, the object is placed at row=1.\n6. The column of the top-left corner of the red shape is always in column 1.\n\n"
