            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the results and a plan to refine the natural language program and subsequently the code:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good start, focusing on the adjacency of azure (8) pixels. However, the additional test cases reveal a more complex rule set involving the interaction of azure (8) pixels with green (3) and blue (1) pixels, and it seems the column condition was not handled correctly.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Refine Adjacency Rule:** Ensure the code correctly handles the replacement of *all* connected azure pixels with gray when any two are adjacent.\n2.  **Clarify Row/Column Conditions:** Re-evaluate the conditions involving green (3) and blue (1) pixels. Specifically, it's critical to make sure if lonely azure (8) is in the same column, or in same row of 1 or 3.\n3.  **Iterative Improvement:** modify and test it, iteratively.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a more detailed analysis of each example:\n\n*   **Example 1 (Success):** The code correctly identifies adjacent 8s and replaces them with 5s.\n*   **Example 2 (Failure):**\n    *   The code fails to replace lower 8 with a 5 because they are connected by a corner and should only consider horizontal and vertical connections.\n    *   The rule regarding 1s and 3s in the same row is partially applied; the 8 next to the 1 should be 5.\n*   **Example 3 (Failure):**\n    *   The top-right 8 is incorrectly turned into a 5. It should only be a 5 if there's a 1 or 3 *in its row*.\n    *   Both 8s on left should become 5, because there is a lonely 8 and a 3 in the first row and a lonely 8 and a 1 in the third row.\n*   **Example 4 (Failure):**\n    *   The code fails to turn the upper-right 8 into 5, because of an adjacency that is not horizontal and vertical.\n    *   The upper-right 8 is also connected to 1 in the same row, so it becomes 5.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
