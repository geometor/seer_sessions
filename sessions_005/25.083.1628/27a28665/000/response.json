The output seems to relate to the *number* of objects in the input grid, but not simply the total count of non-zero pixels. The critical factor seems to be a specific geometric arrangement and the count of non-zero colors forming connected components *excluding* a certain object touching the image border, the biggest or simply any object on the border?.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Two pixels are considered connected if they share a side (not just a corner).\n2. **Border Check:** For each connected component, determine if it touches the border of the grid.\n3. **Count and Exclude :** count the number of connected colored regions, and subtract a count for each corner touching the border.\n\n**Elaboration and Hypothesis:**\n\nThe core concept is counting distinct \"blobs\" of color. However, based on examples 4, 5, 6 and 7 there is a trick.\n\nIt *appears* the rule is more complex, and examples 1, 2, 3 are coincidences, but, if we sum all connected components and substract by the number of non-zero colored areas touching the border.\n\n*   Example 4: Two regions (8,8,8) and (8,8,8), two regions touching the border = 2\n*   Example 5: Two regions (5,5,5) and (5,5,5), two regions touching the border = 2\n*   Example 6: Four regions (4,4) ,(4), (4), (4,4), each composed by just one number, three regions touching the border = 1\n*   Example 7: Four regions (5,5) ,(5), (5), (5,5), each composed by just one number, three regions touching the border = 1\n\nLet's test this.\n"
