            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was too specific to the first example and a couple of others, failing to generalize to all cases. It seems the logic tried to capture very precise '5' positions, but the underlying rule is more general, likely about the relationship *between* the '5's rather than absolute positions. The new test showed that examples 1 and 3 did not pass. We need to rethink strategy in broad terms and account for all cases.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze all examples:** Examine the inputs and expected outputs of *all* training examples carefully, looking for common patterns.\n2.  **Focus on relationships:** Pay close attention to the *relative* positions of the '5' pixels, not just their absolute coordinates. Diagonals, rows, columns, etc.\n3.  **Simplify the rules:** Aim for the simplest possible rules that explain the transformations.\n4.  **Re-evaluate the output:** The structure of the output seems dependent on the diagonals and their orientations.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis, no code execution needed for this level of observation):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: '5's on (0,0), (1,1), (2,0). Almost a diagonal, interrupted bottom-left.\n    *   Expected Output: Red top row, Yellow middle row, Red bottom row (2, 4, 2).\n    *   Result: Failed. The code doesn't handle this \"broken diagonal\" case.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: '5's in the last column (x=2).\n    *   Expected Output: All Green (3).\n    *   Result: Passed. One of the hard coded rules was hit.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: '5's on (0,1), (1,2), (2,1) - almost a diagonal, interupted at bottom.\n    *   Expected Output: Yellow top, Green middle, Yellow bottom (4,3,4)\n    *   Result: Failed.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: '5's forming a diagonal from top-right to bottom-left (0,2), (1,1), (2,0).\n    *   Expected Output: Green, Yellow, Red rows (3, 4, 2).\n    *   Result: Passed. The final hard coded rule was correct.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
