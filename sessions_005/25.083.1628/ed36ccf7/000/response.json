The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the pixels within the grid, specifically a rotation or reflection of some sort. There's a consistent pattern of color preservation \u2013 the number of pixels of each color remains the same between the input and output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
