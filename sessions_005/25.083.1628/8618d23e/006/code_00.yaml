facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - action: split
    description: Divide the input grid into two parts (top and bottom). The split occurs at the row where either the row consists of all the same values or the first value of a row does not match the very first value of the first row.
    parameters:
      - split_row: Row index where the split occurs.
  - action: interleave_top
    description:  The rows of the top part are each followed by a row of 9s. Append 9 to each row.
  - action: insert_separator
    description: Insert a row of 9s after the interleaved top part.
  - action: interleave_bottom
    description:  Prepend 9 to each row. The rows of the bottom part are each followed by a row of 9s.
  - observation: consistent_colors
    description: The output grid uses the same color palette as the input grid, plus the color 9 (maroon).
  - observation: shape_change
    description: The output grid's dimensions are derived from the input grid's dimensions and the split point, but the previous logic had errors.
