    description: The input_grid is placed inside the output_grid.
    details:
        - The output grid always extends the dimensions of input grid by adding
          exactly one additional row and one additional column.
        - if input_grid has > 1 column, input grid is embedded aligned to
          the top left.
        - The additional space in output grid that is not occupied by the
          embedded input_grid is filled with the color maroon (9).
        - Example 1: A row is added after row 2, column added at end.
        - Example 2: A row is added after row 1, column added at end.
        - Example 3: A row is added after row 3, column added at end.
