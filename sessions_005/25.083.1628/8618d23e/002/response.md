Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information and a plan to address the discrepancies between the expected and generated outputs.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was a good first attempt, aiming to embed the input grid within a larger maroon-colored grid. However, the results clearly show it's not correctly handling all cases. The primary issues are:

1.  **Incorrect Row/Column Padding:** The logic for adding rows and columns around the input grid is flawed. It doesn't consistently produce the expected output dimensions, especially concerning the placement of the maroon border. The provided examples make it clear the code calculates padding on the assumption that there is always either padding one all around or just on one side.
2.  **Inconsistent Embedding:** The row and column start positions for embedding are not always correct, leading to misaligned output.

The strategy to resolve these errors will involve:

1.  **Analyzing the Pattern of Padding:** Carefully examining all three examples to discern the *exact* rule governing how the maroon border is applied. We need to identify if it's a fixed number of rows/columns, or if it depends on the input grid's dimensions or content.
2.  **Revising the Padding and Embedding Logic:** Based on the analysis, we'll rewrite the code to correctly calculate the output grid's dimensions and the starting position for embedding the input.
3. **Simplifying the conditional logic**: Try and combine the single column/row padding.

**Gathering Metrics**

To accurately diagnose the problem, I need to understand the exact dimensions and content of the input and output grids.

import numpy as np

def describe_grid(grid):
    grid = np.array(grid)
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    unique_values = np.unique(grid)
    return {
        'rows': rows,
        'cols': cols,
        'unique_values': unique_values.tolist()
    }

examples = [

            [0]
        ],

    {
        'input': [
            [2, 2, 2],
            [2, 8, 8],
            [2, 2, 2],
            [8, 7, 7],

            [9, 8, 8, 7],
            [9, 8, 7, 7]
        ]
    }
]

for i, example in enumerate(examples):
    input_desc = describe_grid(example['input'])
    expected_desc = describe_grid(example['expected'])
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    print(f"  Input: Rows={input_desc['rows']}, Cols={input_desc['cols']}, Unique Values={input_desc['unique_values']}")
    print(f"  Expected: Rows={expected_desc['rows']}, Cols={expected_desc['cols']}, Unique Values={expected_desc['unique_values']}")


```
```
Example 1:
  Input: Rows=4, Cols=2, Unique Values=[1, 5, 6, 7]
  Expected: Rows=5, Cols=3, Unique Values=[1, 5, 6, 7, 9]
Example 2:
  Input: Rows=2, Cols=1, Unique Values=[0, 4]
  Expected: Rows=3, Cols=2, Unique Values=[0, 4, 9]
Example 3:
  Input: Rows=6, Cols=3, Unique Values=[2, 7, 8]
  Expected: Rows=7, Cols=4, Unique Values=[2, 7, 8, 9]

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      rows: variable
      cols: variable
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      rows: input_grid.rows + 1
      cols: input_grid.cols + 1
      fill_color: 9 (maroon)
  - action: embedding
    description: The input_grid is placed inside the output_grid.
    details:
        - The output grid always extends the dimensions of input grid by adding
          exactly one additional row and one additional column.
        - if input_grid has > 1 column, input grid is embedded aligned to
          the top left.
        - The additional space in output grid that is not occupied by the
          embedded input_grid is filled with the color maroon (9).
        - Example 1: A row is added after row 2, column added at end.
        - Example 2: A row is added after row 1, column added at end.
        - Example 3: A row is added after row 3, column added at end.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid (output\_grid) with dimensions one row greater and one column greater than the input grid (input\_grid).
2.  **Fill with Maroon:** Fill all cells of the output\_grid with the color maroon (value 9).
3.  **Embed Input:** Copy the contents of the input\_grid into the output\_grid, starting at the top-left corner (row 0, column 0) of the output grid.

Essentially, the input is *always* embedded at the top-left and there is one row/column appended to the input grid.
