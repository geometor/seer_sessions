            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information and a plan to address the discrepancies between the expected and generated outputs.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was a good first attempt, aiming to embed the input grid within a larger maroon-colored grid. However, the results clearly show it's not correctly handling all cases. The primary issues are:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Row/Column Padding:** The logic for adding rows and columns around the input grid is flawed. It doesn't consistently produce the expected output dimensions, especially concerning the placement of the maroon border. The provided examples make it clear the code calculates padding on the assumption that there is always either padding one all around or just on one side.\n2.  **Inconsistent Embedding:** The row and column start positions for embedding are not always correct, leading to misaligned output.\n\nThe strategy to resolve these errors will involve:\n\n1.  **Analyzing the Pattern of Padding:** Carefully examining all three examples to discern the *exact* rule governing how the maroon border is applied. We need to identify if it's a fixed number of rows/columns, or if it depends on the input grid's dimensions or content.\n2.  **Revising the Padding and Embedding Logic:** Based on the analysis, we'll rewrite the code to correctly calculate the output grid's dimensions and the starting position for embedding the input.\n3. **Simplifying the conditional logic**: Try and combine the single column/row padding.\n\n**Gathering Metrics**\n\nTo accurately diagnose the problem, I need to understand the exact dimensions and content of the input and output grids.\n\n"
