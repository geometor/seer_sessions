            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were too specific to the first training example. It correctly identified the 2x2 output size and the use of the first two pixels from certain rows, but it incorrectly assumed a direct mapping that doesn't generalize across all examples. The second example working was coincidental. The core issue is that the rule isn't adaptive; it's a fixed mapping rather than a relational one. We need to shift from \"copy these specific pixels\" to \"find a relationship between input and output based on position, color, or other properties.\"\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze All Examples:** Carefully examine all input/output pairs, not just the first one. Look for consistent patterns or relationships that hold true across *all* examples, not just one or two.\n2.  **Re-evaluate Assumptions:** The initial code was based on row-specific assumptions (row 1 and row 2). We need to see if there's a more general way to describe the relationship between input and output pixel positions.\n3.  **Focus on Relative, Not Absolute, Positions:** Consider if the output's pixels are determined by their relative position within the input (e.g., top-left corner, a specific offset from a feature) rather than fixed row/column indices.\n4. **Consider simple operations:** Count the colors.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**\n\nSince I can't directly execute code here, I'll describe the analysis I would perform and the information I'd gather. I would use python to examine color counts.\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input shape (5x5), Output shape (2x2). The code's prediction was incorrect.\n*   **Example 2:** Input shape (5x5), Output shape (2x2). The code's prediction was, coincidentally, correct.\n*   **Example 3:** Input shape (5x5), Output shape (2x2). The code's prediction was incorrect.\n\n**Hypothesis and Observations**\n*   **Size Consistency:** All output grids are 2x2. This part of the rule is correct.\n*   **Color Palette:** It seems like the colors present are always white (0) and blue (1).\n*   **No Simple Positional Mapping:** The original assumption about directly copying from rows 1 and 2 of the input is incorrect, as shown by the failures in Examples 1 and 3.\n* The rule appears to involve constructing the output from the top-left corner (first two rows and columns).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
