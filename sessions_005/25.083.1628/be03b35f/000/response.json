The sub-grid appears to be defined by the top-left \"object\" composed of blue and white pixels. The width of the output is equal to number of columns occupied by the top-left object, and height is equal to the number of rows occupied by the top-left object. The output is copied from top-left corner of the object. It seems that the rest of the grid content (specifically the presence of red pixels towards the bottom-right) is irrelevant to the transformation.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
