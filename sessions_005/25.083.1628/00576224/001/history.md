## train_1

**input:**
```
7 9
4 3
```


**output:**
```
7 9 7 9 7 9
4 3 4 3 4 3
9 7 9 7 9 7
3 4 3 4 3 4
7 9 7 9 7 9
4 3 4 3 4 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
8 6
6 4
```


**output:**
```
8 6 8 6 8 6
6 4 6 4 6 4
6 8 6 8 6 8
4 6 4 6 4 6
8 6 8 6 8 6
6 4 6 4 6 4
```

Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation logic. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a 2x2 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors).
*   The output is a 6x6 grid of single-digit integers.
*   The input grid seems to be replicated and arranged in a specific pattern within the output grid.
*    The pattern appears to alternate the rows and it also alternates swapping the columns on a per row basis.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 2
      columns: 2
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 6
      columns: 6
      elements: integers (0-9)

actions:
  - name: replicate
    description: The input grid is replicated multiple times.
  - name: arrange
    description: The replicated grids are arranged in a specific pattern.
  - name: alternate_and_swap
    description: The rows alternate and, within alternating rows, the columns of the original 2x2 input are swapped.

relationships:
  - input_to_output: The input grid's elements are used to construct the output grid through replication, arrangement, and swapping.
  - rows: a multiplication relationship exists, input * 3 = output
  - cols: a multiplication relationship exists, input * 3 = output

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Replication:** Replicate the input 2x2 grid three times horizontally and three times vertically.
2.  **Arrangement Pattern -** Create a 6x6 grid.
    *   Populate rows by repeating the first input row three times and the second input row three times, alternating.
3. **Column Swapping:**
    *   For every other generated row, starting with the *second generated row*, swap the elements of the original input.
    *  That is, if the first row of the 2x2 input is `a b` then every other generated row of `a b a b a b` transforms to `b a b a b a`.
