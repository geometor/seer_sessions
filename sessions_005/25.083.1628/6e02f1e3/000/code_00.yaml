facts:
  - observation: Input grids are square.
  - observation: Output grids are the same dimensions as input grids.
  - observation: Input grids contain a single color repeated across the grid.
  - observation: Output grids contain a maximum of two colors: white and gray.
  - observation: "Gray pixels form a diagonal cross or an X shape in the output, or are all gray"
  - observation: "The rest of the output pixels are white"
  - rule: "If every cell in the input grid has a value of 3 or a value of 4, the entire output grid is three gray pixels in the first row and the rest are white"
  - rule: "Otherwise the gray output cells are a diagonal X, the rest are white"
