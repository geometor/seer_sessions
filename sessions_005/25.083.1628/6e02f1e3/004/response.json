            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the results and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe current code correctly handles cases where the input grid is entirely filled with either green (3) or yellow (4). However, it fails when the input grid contains a mix of colors *and* when a diagonal cross pattern is needed but it stretches more that 3 pixels . The core issue is the misinterpretation of the diagonal cross rule. It seems to limit the gray pixels too strictly and doesn't account for all valid cases in the cross. It appears that no matter what, only the top most three lines are affected, whether all uniform, or require the cross shape.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Diagonal Cross Logic:** The code needs to correctly draw a diagonal cross that can, at most, affect the top three rows. The gray pixels apply only to three cells at most.\n2.  **Conditional Logic:** Maintain the distinction between uniform (all 3s or all 4s) and non-uniform grids.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nI need to carefully examine the dimensions and pixel values of each input and output. Since I can't directly execute the code, I will rely on manual inspection based on the human provided output in the examples, and then I will use a python tool to calculate the needed values.\n\n*Example Metrics and Result*\n\n"
