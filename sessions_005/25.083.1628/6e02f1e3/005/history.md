Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms an input grid into an output grid based on these rules:

1.  **Examine Input Grid:** Get the dimensions (rows and columns) of the input grid.
2.  **Check for Uniformity:** Determine if *all* pixel values in the input grid are either the value 3 (green) *or* the value 4 (yellow).
3.  **Conditional Transformation:**
    *   **If Uniform (all 3s or all 4s):** Create an output grid of the same dimensions, where only the top three pixels are gray (value 5) and the remaining are white(value 0).
    *   **If Not Uniform:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions, where the pixels positioned in the shape of a diagonal cross from the top left to the bottom right and top right and bottom left are colored gray (value 5), the number of pixels shall be three at most, and the remaining pixels are colored white (value 0).

Okay, here's a breakdown of the results and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The current code correctly handles cases where the input grid is entirely filled with either green (3) or yellow (4). However, it fails when the input grid contains a mix of colors *and* when a diagonal cross pattern is needed but it stretches more that 3 pixels . The core issue is the misinterpretation of the diagonal cross rule. It seems to limit the gray pixels too strictly and doesn't account for all valid cases in the cross. It appears that no matter what, only the top most three lines are affected, whether all uniform, or require the cross shape.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Diagonal Cross Logic:** The code needs to correctly draw a diagonal cross that can, at most, affect the top three rows. The gray pixels apply only to three cells at most.
2.  **Conditional Logic:** Maintain the distinction between uniform (all 3s or all 4s) and non-uniform grids.

**Gather Metrics:**

I need to carefully examine the dimensions and pixel values of each input and output. Since I can't directly execute the code, I will rely on manual inspection based on the human provided output in the examples, and then I will use a python tool to calculate the needed values.

*Example Metrics and Result*


```
Example 1:
Input: 3x3, all 3s
Output: 3x3, top row 5s, rest 0s
Result: Match

Example 2:
Input: 3x3, mixed
Output: 3x3, cross, max 3 pixels are 5, rest 0
Result: Mismatch, error in cross application, too many in the first column, to few in the last

Example 3:
Input: 3x3, all 4s
Output: 3x3, top row 5s, rest 0s
Result: Match

Example 4:
Input: 3x3, mixed
Output: 3x3, cross, max 3 pixels are 5, rest 0
Result: Mismatch, error in cross application, too many in the first column, to few in the last

Example 5:
Input: 3x3, mixed
Output: 3x3, cross, max 3 pixels are 5, rest 0
Result: Mismatch, error in cross application, too many in the first column, to few in the last

facts:
  - rule_type: conditional
  - condition_1:
      description: Input grid contains only color 3 (green) or color 4 (yellow).
      action: Set the first three pixels of the first row in output grid to color 5 (gray), rest to 0 (white).
  - condition_2:
      description: Input grid contains colors other than 3 or 4.
      action: |-
        Create a cross from top left to bottom right corners, and top right corner to bottom left corner. The maximum number of gray(5) pixels to affect is 3. All other cells are assigned 0 (white).

  - object_types:
      - name: grid
        properties:
          - rows: integer
          - cols: integer
          - cells: list[integer] # 0-9 representing colors

  - actions:
      - set_pixel: Changes the color of a specific pixel.
      - create_cross: Draws a cross on the grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine Input:** Determine the dimensions (rows and columns) of the input grid.

2.  **Uniformity Check:** Check if all the pixels in the input grid are *either* color 3 (green) *or* color 4 (yellow).

3.  **Conditional Transformation:**
    *   **If Uniform:** Create an output grid of the same size. Fill the *first three* pixels of the *first row* with color 5 (gray). All other pixels should be color 0 (white).
    *   **If Not Uniform:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions. Draw a diagonal cross using color 5 (gray) connecting the top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left corners, limit to the top most three rows and also limited to a total of three gray cells. All other pixels should be color 0 (white).
