Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs and outputs are square grids of single-digit integers (0-4 in the examples).\n*   The dimensions of the grids are consistent within each example pair (4x4).\n*   The transformation appears to involve a rearrangement of the values within the grid, rather than a change in the values themselves.\n* There is no obvious arithmetic or color-based pattern (given prior knowledge that digits may refer to colors).\n*   The '0' values seem to act almost like \"empty\" or background pixels which get replaced.\n*   There is a symmetry to the transformations that suggests reflection or rotation.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

In train\\_3, the 2nd column has zeros.\n2.  **Column Transformation** For each of these special columns, replace values of `0` by consecutive integers, and leave other values as they are. For train\\_1, the first column becomes `[1,4,2,3]`. For train\\_2, the first and second columns become `[1,3,2,4]` and `[2,4,1,3]` respectively.
