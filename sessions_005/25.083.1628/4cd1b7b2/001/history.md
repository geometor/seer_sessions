## train_1

**input:**
```
0 4 2 3
4 1 0 2
0 3 4 0
3 0 1 4
```


**output:**
```
1 4 2 3
4 1 3 2
2 3 4 1
3 2 1 4
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
1 0 3 4
0 0 2 1
2 1 4 0
0 3 1 2
```


**output:**
```
1 2 3 4
3 4 2 1
2 1 4 3
4 3 1 2
```


## train_3

**input:**
```
3 0 2 1
1 0 0 0
4 3 0 2
0 1 4 3
```


**output:**
```
3 4 2 1
1 2 3 4
4 3 1 2
2 1 4 3
```

Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are square grids of single-digit integers (0-4 in the examples).
*   The dimensions of the grids are consistent within each example pair (4x4).
*   The transformation appears to involve a rearrangement of the values within the grid, rather than a change in the values themselves.
* There is no obvious arithmetic or color-based pattern (given prior knowledge that digits may refer to colors).
*   The '0' values seem to act almost like "empty" or background pixels which get replaced.
*   There is a symmetry to the transformations that suggests reflection or rotation.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 4x4
      elements: integers (0-4)
      structure: 2D array

actions:
  - type: rearrangement
    description: Elements within the grid are reordered based on a specific pattern.

relationships:
  - type: input-output
    description: Each input grid has a corresponding output grid with the same dimensions and element values, but rearranged.
  - type: positional_change
    description: It seems that columns which has '0' are subject to some replacement
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify 'special' columns:** Iterate through each column in the input grid. The rules for identifying special columns change from example to example. In train\_1, the 1st column has '0'. In train\_2, 1st and 2nd column has '0'. In train\_3, the 2nd column has zeros.
2.  **Column Transformation** For each of these special columns, replace values of `0` by consecutive integers, and leave other values as they are. For train\_1, the first column becomes `[1,4,2,3]`. For train\_2, the first and second columns become `[1,3,2,4]` and `[2,4,1,3]` respectively. For train\_3, the second column becomes `[4,2,3,1]`.

3. **Output:** Construct the output matrix.
