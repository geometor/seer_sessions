            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code performs a mirroring and horizontal fill operation. It correctly handles the first example. However, it fails in the second and third examples because of how the horizontal fill is implemented. The fill logic connects mirrored parts of the object that shouldn't be connected. We need to refine the fill operation to be more context-aware and only fill between mirrored pixels that are part of an original contiguous object.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Examples:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output of each example to pinpoint the exact discrepancies. Pay close attention to the second and third examples.\n2.  **Refine Horizontal Fill:** Modify the horizontal fill logic. Instead of filling between the absolute leftmost and rightmost orange pixels in a row, we should fill *only* between mirrored pairs that originate from the same continuous object in the input.\n3.  **Object Identification:** Ensure we can differentiate between separate object segments in a single row. This is crucial for the fill logic.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using manual inspection for now, can automate with code later if needed):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 6)\n    *   Object Color: 7 (orange)\n    *   Object identified and mirrored correctly.\n    *   Horizontal Fill: Correct.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 6)\n    *   Object Color: 7\n    *   Object identified and mirrored correctly.\n    *   Horizontal Fill: Incorrect. Filled between two separate mirrored segments. Two pixels are incorrect (0,2) and (0,3).\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 6)\n    *   Object Color: 7\n    *   Object identified and mirrored correctly.\n    *   Horizontal Fill: Incorrect. Filled the entire row when it should not have. Four pixels are incorrect (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), and (1,4)\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
