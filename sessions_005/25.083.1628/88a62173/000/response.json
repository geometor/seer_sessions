Here's my breakdown of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs are grids of varying sizes, all with a row of zeros in the center.\n*   The outputs are 2x2 grids.\n*   The outputs seem to be derived from the top-left and bottom-right corners of the input grids, excluding the center row of zeros. Specifically it appears that the relevant portions are the first two elements of the top left corner and the bottom two elements of the bottom right corner.\n* There seems to be a 90 degree clockwise rotation involved.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

This transforms a 2 x 2 matrix such as the one made up of `[[a, b], [c, d]]` into `[[c, a], [d, b]]`\n5.  **Create Output:** Form a 2x2 output grid with these extracted and rotated pixel values.\n\nIn summary, the transformation extracts a 2x2 section from corners of the input, excluding a center row of zeros, rotates it, and uses that as the output.\n"
