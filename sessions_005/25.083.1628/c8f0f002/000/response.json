The most prominent change appears to be the replacement of a specific color (represented by the digit '7', which corresponds to orange) with another color ('5', gray). The replacement doesn't affect all instances of '7', but seems to be spatially determined. It is not clear the extent, but is highly likely related to the edge of the grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Other '7' are unaffected.\n```"

Change the color to '5' (gray) in the corresponding cell of the output grid.\n4.  **Else**:\n    a. Keep the color value the same, and output in output grid.\n\nEssentially, the rule appears to be changing \"orange\" color to \"gray\" for pixels located on the perimeter or maybe specific locations.\n"
