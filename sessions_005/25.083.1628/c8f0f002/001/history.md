## train_1

**input:**
```
7 7 7 1
1 8 1 7
7 1 1 7
```


**output:**
```
5 5 5 1
1 8 1 5
5 1 1 5
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
1 8 8 7 7 8
1 1 7 7 1 8
7 1 1 7 7 8
```


**output:**
```

```


## train_3

**input:**
```
1 8 1 7 1
7 8 8 1 1

```


**output:**

```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels into another grid of the same dimensions. The most prominent change appears to be the replacement of a specific color (represented by the digit '7', which corresponds to orange) with another color ('5', gray). The replacement doesn't affect all instances of '7', but seems to be spatially determined. It is not clear the extent, but is highly likely related to the edge of the grid.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      Color '7' (orange) in the input grid is sometimes replaced by color '5' (gray) in the output grid.
  - observation: |
     Other colors (like '1', '8') remain unchanged.
  - hypothesis: |
     Color '7' at corners or on the outer edge gets replace by '5'. Other '7' are unaffected.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  **Check** If the current cell's color is '7' (orange).
3.  **If '7' and is located at edge of the grid**:
    a. Change the color to '5' (gray) in the corresponding cell of the output grid.
4.  **Else**:
    a. Keep the color value the same, and output in output grid.

Essentially, the rule appears to be changing "orange" color to "gray" for pixels located on the perimeter or maybe specific locations.
