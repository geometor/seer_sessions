Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and the code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis of a simple reflection across the main diagonal is incorrect. The expected outputs show a more complex transformation. It seems that non-zero values on opposite sides of the diagonal and are swapped in position *and* exchanged with each other. It's clear the previous code only transposes and does not correctly map the input to the desired output. The errors are consistent across both examples, indicating a systematic flaw in the transformation logic. The strategy will involve re-examining the relationship between input and output grids to identify the correct swapping rule, and then updating the natural language program and code accordingly.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where necessary):**

For detailed pixel-by-pixel comparisons, it's not efficient to use `tool_code` here directly. We already have the transformed outputs and expected outputs. We'll derive metrics directly from those.

*Example 1:*

*   Input Shape: (4, 4)
*   Output Shape: (4, 4)
*   Non-zero Input Pixels: (1,1): 5, (1,2): 6, (2,1): 8, (2,2): 3
*   Non-zero Output Pixels: (0,0): 5, (0,3): 6, (3,0): 8, (3,3): 3
*   Observations: The input grid is a square. Non zero pixels are reflected along the main diagonal AND also reflected accross the center, swapping positions with cell at the opposite position.

*Example 2:*

*   Input Shape: (4, 4)
*   Output Shape: (4, 4)
*   Non-zero Input Pixels: (1,1): 3, (1,2): 4, (2,1): 7, (2,2): 6
*   Non-zero Output Pixels: (0,0): 3, (0,3): 4, (3,0): 7, (3,3): 6
*   Observations: Same observation as example 1.

```yaml
task: diagonal_reflection_and_swap
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 4
      columns: 4
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
      non_zero_pixels:
        example_1: [(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)]
        example_2: [(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)]
transformations:
  - type: reflection_and_swap
    description: Reflects non-zero pixel positions across the main diagonal and across the center.
    details:
      - Non-zero pixels are identified.
      - Each non-zero pixel at (r, c) swaps its value with the pixel at (cols-1-c, rows-1-r).
      - Zero pixels remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-zero Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that have a value other than zero.
2.  **Reflect and Swap:** For each non-zero pixel at row `r` and column `c`, swap its value with the pixel located at row `(number of columns - 1 - c)` and column `(number of rows - 1 - r)`.
3. **Preserve Zeroes:** Pixels with a value of zero remain unchanged in their original positions.
4. The input and output are square.

This revised natural language program accurately captures the "reflection across the antidiagonal" behavior seen in the examples. The previous version only described the simpler transpose action.
