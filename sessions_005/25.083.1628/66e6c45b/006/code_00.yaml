observations:
  - object: 2x2 subgrid
    properties:
      - contains: 4 pixels
      - location: defined by top-left pixel coordinates (row, col)
      - rotation: 180 degrees (rotates within its own 2x2 space)
    actions:
      - rotate: Each 2x2 subgrid is rotated independently.
  - grid: input_grid
    properties:
        - dimensions: height and width are even numbers
    actions:
        - divide: into 2x2 subgrids.
