Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on discerning the transformation logic and expressing it in a structured way:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The output grid seems to be an expanded version of the input grid, with some notable changes:

1.  **Expansion:** The output grid is larger than the input grid in both dimensions.
2.  **Duplication:** Each pixel in the input grid appears to be duplicated horizontally and vertically in the output grid, creating 2x2 blocks of the same color.
3.  **Border:** A border of black (0) pixels is added around the expanded grid.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - height: variable (2 in example 1, 2 in example 2, 3 in example 3)
      - width: variable (3 in example 1, 2 in example 2, 3 in example 3)
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - height: input_grid.height * 2 + 2
      - width: input_grid.width * 2 + 2
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)

  - action: pixel_duplication
    description: Each pixel in input_grid is duplicated to form a 2x2 block in output_grid.
    input: input_grid pixel
    output: 2x2 block in output_grid

  - action: border_addition
    description: A border of 0 (black) pixels is added around the duplicated grid.
    input: expanded grid (after pixel duplication)
    output: output_grid

  - relationship: size_relation
    description: output_grid dimensions are derived from input_grid dimensions.
    formula:
      - output_height = input_height * 2 + 2
      - output_width = input_width * 2 + 2
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Duplicate Pixels:** For each pixel in the input grid, create a 2x2 block of the same color in a new grid. This new grid will be twice the height and twice the width of the original. The original pixel at `input[row][col]` maps to a 2x2 block at locations:
    *   `output[2*row][2*col]`
    *   `output[2*row][2*col + 1]`
    *   `output[2*row + 1][2*col]`
    *   `output[2*row + 1][2*col + 1]`

2.  **Add Border:** Surround the resulting expanded grid with a border of black (0) pixels. This increases both the height and width by 2.

In short: The input grid's pixels are doubled in both dimensions, and the result has black border added.
