The core operation seems to be a form of duplication and reflection, specifically, mirroring the input grid to create a larger output grid. The colors (represented by digits 0 and 1) are preserved during this transformation. The transformation is creating a new set of rows that represent the original set of rows mirrored.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
