The transformation seems to involve a downward \"expansion\" or \"filling\" of the yellow (`4`) regions. The top rows of zeros seem to disappear as yellow expands, but importantly, the overall grid dimensions are preserved. The expansion doesn't seem to stop at any particular obstacle (as there are no other non-zero colors), it propagates downwards until the bottom of the grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This means changing all `0` (white) pixels directly below any yellow pixel to `4` (yellow).\n3.  **Boundary Condition:** Continue the downward expansion until the bottom edge of the grid is reached.  The overall size of the grid remains constant. Essentially, yellow 'falls' or 'fills down' the grid.\n4. **Preserve Grid Size.** Make sure there are no new rows and the number of rows in the output equals the number of rows in the input.\n\nEssentially, the transformation rule is to propagate any yellow color downwards to the bottom of the grid, overwriting any white pixels encountered along the way. The crucial aspect here is a combination of *objectness* (the yellow regions), *goal-directedness* (the downward expansion), and *geometry* (the 2D grid and downward direction).\n"
