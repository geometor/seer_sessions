example_1:
  input:
    objects:
      - color: yellow
        shape: single pixel
        position: row 4, column 2
      - color: white
        shape: contiguous blocks
        position: surrounding the yellow pixel
  output:
    action: downward_fill
    condition:  yellow pixel exists, fill empty pixels below
    result: yellow pixels extend down by one position to row 4 and fill pixels on row 4 around original yellow position

example_2:
  input:
    objects:
      - color: yellow
        shape: single pixel, and a contiguous 1x3 block
        position:  row 3, column 2 (single); row 4, columns 1-3 (block)
      - color: white
        shape: contiguous blocks
        position:  above and around yellow blocks
  output:
      action: downward_fill, and fill to the end
      result: column 2 becomes a 3x1 block of yellow

example_3:
  input:
    objects:
        - color: yellow
          shape: contiguous blocks that occupies most space
          position: all cells except (0,0) and (0,4)
        - color: white
          shape: single pixel
          position: (0,0) and (0,4)
  output:
    action: fill white pixels with yellow
    result: all pixels change to yellow
