The most prominent colors are green (3), blue (1), and yellow (4). White (0) acts as a background. The key difference between input and output seems to involve the blue and yellow pixels in the lower right corner of the input grids, which disappear in the output grids. The green pixels in the top left of each input grid remain, although their shape might change.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Its shape may be adjusted, but overall it should occupy positions near where they were originally. It appears that if there is a 2x2 green object, it is transformed to a 1xN or Nx1 object.\n5.  **Clear** all other pixels to white (0). The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n\nEssentially the program removes blue/yellow objects in the bottom-right and keeps/transforms any green object(s) in the top-left.\n"
