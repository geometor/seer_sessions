Identify and keep the green (3) object(s) in the top-left region of the input grid.
Identify the object with blue and yellow pixels in the bottom-right corner, and remove them.
The green object's shape may be adjusted, but overall it should occupy positions near where they were originally.
Clear all other pixels to white (0). The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
