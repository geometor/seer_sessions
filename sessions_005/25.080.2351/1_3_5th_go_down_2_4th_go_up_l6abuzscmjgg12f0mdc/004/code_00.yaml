examples:
  - example_1:
      objects:
        - type: row_segment
          description: A contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels within a row.
          behavior: "Segments appear to be mirrored and, in some cases, expanded to fill the row based on proximity to existing elements."
      transformations:
        - type: mirroring
          description: "Non-zero pixels from the input appear to have their horizontal positions mirrored, but not in a simple vertical axis reflection."
        - type: filling
          description: "Zero-valued cells are filled based on the nearest non-zero neighbor in the same row."
      observations:
        - note: "The output maintains the same number of rows and columns as the input."
        - note: "The mirroring logic is not a straightforward reflection about the center column."
  - example_2:
      objects:
        - type: row_segment
          description: Contiguous non-zero pixels in a row.
          behavior: Similar mirroring and filling behavior as in Example 1.
      transformations:
        - type: mirroring
          description: Complex mirroring, not a simple reflection.
        - type: filling
          description: Zero-filling based on proximity.
      observations:
         - note: "Rows with all zeros remain all zeros."
  - example_3:
      objects:
        - type: row_segment
          description: Contiguous non-zero pixels in a row.
          behavior: Similar mirroring and filling behavior as in Examples 1 & 2.
      transformations:
          - type: mirroring
            description: Complex mirroring.
          - type: filling
            description: Proximity-based zero-filling.
      observations:
         - note: There is a definite pattern of propagation toward the edges
