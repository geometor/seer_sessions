*   **Perception:**
    *   The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid.
    *   All provided examples use 3x3 grids for both input and output.
    *   The colors present in the input grid are exactly the same colors present in the output grid, suggesting a rearrangement rather than color modification or generation/deletion of colors.
    *   Comparing the input and output grids, the transformation appears to be a geometric rotation. Specifically, each pixel at position (row, col) in the input seems to move to position (height - 1 - row, width - 1 - col) in the output. This corresponds to a 180-degree rotation around the center of the grid.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: geometric_transformation
    grid_properties:
      - input_output_shape_relation: same_shape
      - grid_size: constant (3x3 in examples)
    object_focus:
      - type: full_grid
      - properties:
          - shape
          - pixel_values
          - pixel_positions
    transformation:
      - type: rotation
      - angle: 180_degrees
      - center: center_of_the_grid
    color_preservation: true
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the input grid.
    2.  Rotate the input grid by 180 degrees.
    3.  The resulting rotated grid is the output grid.
