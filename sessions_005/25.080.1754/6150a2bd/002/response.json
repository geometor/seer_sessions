            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program and code were based on observing the first training example. The tests on examples 1 and 2 reveal discrepancies between the transformed output and the expected output. This indicates that the initial hypothesis (rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise and then reflect vertically) is incorrect or incomplete. The primary issue is not handling all cases, so we must revise understanding of the transformation by re-examining *all* examples, including ones that may have initially seemed to \"match\".\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze *all* provided examples again, focusing on how each element in the input maps to its corresponding element in the output. Look for consistent patterns of movement or transformation. It's likely there is a single rule applying to both.\n\n2.  **Object Identification (YAML):** Even though the initial code did not use object-based reasoning, start building a YAML description to record any potential objects, attributes, and relationships that become apparent. This is a shift to a more object-centered perspective, as suggested by the ARC priors.\n\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the re-examination, develop a more accurate and complete natural language description of the transformation rule.\n\n4. **Iterative process:** Be prepared that this could be a combination of known transformations, therefore we should prepare to add more stages and code if needed.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis (using code execution - hypothetically):**\n\nAlthough I can't execute code here, I would normally use the following approach:\n\n1.  **Pixel-by-Pixel Comparison:** For each example, compare each pixel's initial and final positions and values. A helper function would calculate the coordinate transformations.\n\n2. **Identify Rotation, flips, mirrors:** Attempt to calculate intermediate values to identify known transformations.\n\n**YAML Block (Initial - to be expanded):**\n\n"
