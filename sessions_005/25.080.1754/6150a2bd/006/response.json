The rotation aspect (90 degrees counter-clockwise) seems to be implemented correctly. However, the reflection part is inaccurate. It appears the code performs a horizontal reflection (flipping left-to-right), but based on comparing all the example outputs with the transformed outputs, the reflection needs to be more specific, or there is different action needed..\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Rotation:** Although the rotation seems correct, I will start with a tool to analyze pixel positions before and after transformation to confirm that every pixel moves in all examples in the same rotation.\n2.  **Re-evaluate Reflection:** I'll discard the simple horizontal flip and examine the relationship between pixel positions in the rotated grid and the final output grid to identify what is happening after the rotation.. This will involve comparing coordinates and colors.\n3.  **Focus on Object Properties:** If simple reflection isn't the answer, I will examine what is changing about specific pixels or regions to understand the \"objects\".\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**\n\nI'll use a `tool_code` block to perform some analysis.\n\n"
