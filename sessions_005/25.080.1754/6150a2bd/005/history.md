Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were a good first attempt, capturing the rotation aspect but misinterpreting the reflection. The code correctly rotates the grid counter-clockwise, but the vertical reflection is incorrect. The errors in both examples highlight a misunderstanding of the reflection axis. It's not a simple vertical flip of the whole grid, but likely a reflection *within* the rotated coordinates.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze both training examples, paying close attention to the *relative* positions of pixels before and after the transformation. Visualize the 90-degree rotation, then *carefully* map how each pixel moves.
2.  **Correct Reflection Logic:** The reflection is likely not a simple `fliplr` operation on the entire rotated grid. We need to figure out the exact mapping. It could be that original x,y becomes y,-x or something different.
3.  **Metrics Gathering (using code execution):** Use numpy's array comparison and indexing capabilities to determine the precise transformations of individual pixel coordinates. Specifically, I'll use code execution to compare input and output arrays element-wise, focusing on how indices change.
4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the precise index transformations, rewrite the natural language program with a more accurate description of the reflection step.
5.  **Update Code:**  Modify the Python code to reflect the updated program.

**Metrics Gathering and Analysis (with code execution):**

I'll create a tool_code block to compare corresponding indices to check my current code.

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Rotation:** Rotate the entire grid by 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
2.  **Reflection:** After rotation, reflect the grid by swapping elements across the *new* vertical axis.  If the rotated grid has dimensions `r x c`, then for a cell at `(i, j)` in the rotated grid, its new position after reflection will be `(i, c - 1 - j)`. In other words, the row index stays the same, while the column index is "flipped" relative to the *rotated* grid's center column.

The previous program was very close and only required a minor edit to clarify how the "vertical axis" should be interpreted.
