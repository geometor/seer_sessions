The output is always a 6x3 grid.\nObserving the relationship between the input and output grids across all examples, it becomes clear that the output grid is constructed by taking the original input grid and appending a vertically flipped version of the input grid directly below it.\n\n- The top half (first 3 rows) of the output grid is identical to the input grid.\n- The bottom half (last 3 rows) of the output grid is the input grid flipped upside down. Specifically, the last row of the output matches the first row of the input, the second-to-last row of the output matches the second row of the input, and the fourth row of the output matches the third row of the input.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
