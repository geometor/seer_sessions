task_context:
  - description: The task requires transforming a smaller input grid into a larger output grid by reflecting and appending.
  - input_grid_properties:
      - shape: Fixed 3x3 in all examples.
  - output_grid_properties:
      - shape: Fixed 6x3 in all examples (twice the height of the input).
      - relationship_to_input:
          - The top half of the output grid is identical to the input grid.
          - The bottom half of the output grid is a vertical reflection (flipped top-to-bottom) of the input grid.

transformation_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Copy the input grid. This forms the top part of the output.
  - step: 2
    action: Create a vertically flipped version of the input grid.
    details: The order of the rows is reversed (row 0 becomes the last row, row 1 the second-to-last, etc.).
  - step: 3
    action: Concatenate the original input grid and the flipped grid vertically.
    details: The original grid is placed above the flipped grid.
  - step: 4
    action: The resulting concatenated grid is the final output.
