Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input & Output Grids:** Each example consists of an input grid and an output grid. The output grid is always larger than the input grid.
2.  **Size Change:** Observing the dimensions:
    *   Example 1: Input (4x2) -> Output (5x3)
    *   Example 2: Input (2x1) -> Output (3x2)
    *   Example 3: Input (6x3) -> Output (7x4)
    The output grid consistently has one more row and one more column than the input grid (Output H = Input H + 1, Output W = Input W + 1).
3.  **Content Preservation & Addition:** The colors and relative positions of pixels from the input grid appear to be mostly preserved within the output grid, but they are repositioned. New pixels, specifically the color maroon (9), are added to form the larger output grid.
4.  **Structural Transformation:** The input grid seems to be conceptually split into two horizontal halves.
    *   The top half appears in the top-left portion of the output grid, maintaining its original dimensions and relative pixel positions.
    *   The bottom half appears in the bottom-right portion of the output grid, also maintaining its internal structure but shifted relative to the top half (down by one row and right by one column).
5.  **Filling:** The space created by expanding the grid and shifting the bottom half is filled with maroon (9). This forms a distinctive "cross" or "L-shape" of maroon pixels separating the two copied halves. Specifically, the row at the split index and the first column below the split row appear to be filled with maroon.

**Facts YAML**


```yaml
task_description: Split the input grid horizontally in the middle, create a larger output grid, and place the two halves shifted relative to each other, filling the gap with maroon (9).

grid_properties:
  - input_height: H
  - input_width: W
  - output_height: H + 1
  - output_width: W + 1
  - fill_color: 9 # maroon

definitions:
  - split_row_index: floor(H / 2) # Integer division, effectively H // 2

objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    source: input
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    destination: output
    properties:
      height: H + 1
      width: W + 1
      initial_fill: 9 # maroon
  - name: top_half
    type: subgrid
    source: input_grid
    region: rows 0 to split_row_index - 1, all columns (0 to W - 1)
  - name: bottom_half
    type: subgrid
    source: input_grid
    region: rows split_row_index to H - 1, all columns (0 to W - 1)

actions:
  - action: create_grid
    target: output_grid
    properties:
      height: H + 1
      width: W + 1
      fill_value: 9
  - action: copy_subgrid
    source: top_half
    target: output_grid
    target_location: top-left corner (row 0, col 0)
    target_region: rows 0 to split_row_index - 1, columns 0 to W - 1
  - action: copy_subgrid
    source: bottom_half
    target: output_grid
    target_location: shifted bottom-right (row split_row_index + 1, col 1)
    target_region: rows split_row_index + 1 to H, columns 1 to W

relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions are derived directly from the input grid dimensions.
  - The input grid is partitioned horizontally into `top_half` and `bottom_half` based on `split_row_index`.
  - The `fill_color` (maroon) occupies the cells in the `output_grid` not overwritten by the `copy_subgrid` actions, notably including row `split_row_index` and column 0 from row `split_row_index` onwards.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input grid.
2.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
3.  Calculate the horizontal split index: `split_row = H // 2`.
4.  Create a new output grid with dimensions `(H + 1)` rows and `(W + 1)` columns.
5.  Initialize all cells of this new output grid with the color maroon (9).
6.  Identify the top subgrid of the input: rows from 0 up to (but not including) `split_row`, and all columns (0 to W-1).
7.  Copy this top subgrid to the output grid, placing its top-left corner at position (0, 0).
8.  Identify the bottom subgrid of the input: rows from `split_row` up to (but not including) H, and all columns (0 to W-1).
9.  Copy this bottom subgrid to the output grid, placing its top-left corner at position (`split_row + 1`, 1).
10. Return the completed output grid.
