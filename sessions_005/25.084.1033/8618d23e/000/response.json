            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input & Output Grids:** Each example consists of an input grid and an output grid. The output grid is always larger than the input grid.\n2.  **Size Change:** Observing the dimensions:\n    *   Example 1: Input (4x2) -> Output (5x3)\n    *   Example 2: Input (2x1) -> Output (3x2)\n    *   Example 3: Input (6x3) -> Output (7x4)\n    The output grid consistently has one more row and one more column than the input grid (Output H = Input H + 1, Output W = Input W + 1).\n3.  **Content Preservation & Addition:** The colors and relative positions of pixels from the input grid appear to be mostly preserved within the output grid, but they are repositioned. New pixels, specifically the color maroon (9), are added to form the larger output grid.\n4.  **Structural Transformation:** The input grid seems to be conceptually split into two horizontal halves.\n    *   The top half appears in the top-left portion of the output grid, maintaining its original dimensions and relative pixel positions.\n    *   The bottom half appears in the bottom-right portion of the output grid, also maintaining its internal structure but shifted relative to the top half (down by one row and right by one column).\n5.  **Filling:** The space created by expanding the grid and shifting the bottom half is filled with maroon (9). This forms a distinctive \"cross\" or \"L-shape\" of maroon pixels separating the two copied halves. Specifically, the row at the split index and the first column below the split row appear to be filled with maroon.\n\n**Facts YAML**\n\n"
