**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of colored pixels. The dimensions of the output grid are the same as the input grid in both examples.
2.  **Row-Based Operation:** The transformation appears to operate independently on certain rows. Comparing input and output grids row by row reveals that only odd-indexed rows (row 1, 3, 5, ...) are modified, while even-indexed rows (row 0, 2, 4, ...) remain unchanged.
3.  **Segment Shifting:** Within the modified (odd-indexed) rows, a contiguous segment of pixels undergoes a right circular shift by one position. The pixels outside this segment remain in their original positions relative to the start of the row.
4.  **Segment Identification:** The key challenge is identifying the segment to be shifted within each odd-indexed row.
    *   In Example 1 (row 1: `7 8 3 7`), the segment `[8, 3, 7]` (indices 1-3) shifts right to `[7, 8, 3]`, resulting in the output row `7 7 8 3`.
    *   In Example 2 (row 1: `5 0 7 7 7 7`), the segment `[5, 0, 7]` (indices 0-2) shifts right to `[7, 5, 0]`, resulting in the output row `7 5 0 7 7 7`.
5.  **Rule for Segment Selection:** The segment seems related to the first occurrence of a repeating color within the row. Let `k` be the smallest index (`k >= 1`) such that the color `input[row][k]` has already appeared at an earlier index (`j < k`).
    *   If the repeating color `input[row][k]` is the same as the first color in the row (`input[row][0]`), the segment to be shifted is `input[row][1 : k+1]`.
    *   Otherwise (if the repeating color `input[row][k]` matches a color at an index `j > 0`), the segment to be shifted is `input[row][0 : k]`.
6.  **No Change Condition:** If a row has no repeating colors (after the first element), or if the row is an even-indexed row, it remains unchanged.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the row index `r` (starting from 0).
3.  If the row index `r` is even (`r % 2 == 0`), copy the input row directly to the corresponding row in the output grid.
4.  If the row index `r` is odd (`r % 2 == 1`):
    a.  Initialize the output row as a copy of the input row.
    b.  Search for the first index `k` (where `k >= 1`) such that the color `input[r][k]` is equal to any color `input[r][j]` where `0 <= j < k`.
    c.  If no such index `k` is found (meaning no color repeats after the first element, or the row is too short), proceed to the next row without modification.
    d.  If such an index `k` is found:
        i.  Check if the repeating color `input[r][k]` is the same as the first color in the row, `input[r][0]`.
        ii. If `input[r][k] == input[r][0]`, identify the segment `S` as the slice of the input row from index 1 up to and including index `k` (`input[r][1 : k+1]`). Perform a right circular shift on `S` (the last element moves to the first position). Replace the corresponding segment `output[r][1 : k+1]` with the shifted segment.
        iii. If `input[r][k] != input[r][0]`, identify the segment `S` as the slice of the input row from index 0 up to (but not including) index `k` (`input[r][0 : k]`). Perform a right circular shift on `S`. Replace the corresponding segment `output[r][0 : k]` with the shifted segment.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
