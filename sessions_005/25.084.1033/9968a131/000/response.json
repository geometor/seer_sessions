The dimensions of the output grid are the same as the input grid in both examples.\n2.  **Row-Based Operation:** The transformation appears to operate independently on certain rows. Comparing input and output grids row by row reveals that only odd-indexed rows (row 1, 3, 5, ...) are modified, while even-indexed rows (row 0, 2, 4, ...) remain unchanged.\n3.  **Segment Shifting:** Within the modified (odd-indexed) rows, a contiguous segment of pixels undergoes a right circular shift by one position. The pixels outside this segment remain in their original positions relative to the start of the row.\n4.  **Segment Identification:** The key challenge is identifying the segment to be shifted within each odd-indexed row.\n    *   In Example 1 (row 1: `7 8 3 7`), the segment `[8, 3, 7]` (indices 1-3) shifts right to `[7, 8, 3]`, resulting in the output row `7 7 8 3`.\n    *   In Example 2 (row 1: `5 0 7 7 7 7`), the segment `[5, 0, 7]` (indices 0-2) shifts right to `[7, 5, 0]`, resulting in the output row `7 5 0 7 7 7`.\n5.  **Rule for Segment Selection:** The segment seems related to the first occurrence of a repeating color within the row. Let `k` be the smallest index (`k >= 1`) such that the color `input[row][k]` has already appeared at an earlier index (`j < k`).\n    *   If the repeating color `input[row][k]` is the same as the first color in the row (`input[row][0]`), the segment to be shifted is `input[row][1 : k+1]`.\n    *   Otherwise (if the repeating color `input[row][k]` matches a color at an index `j > 0`), the segment to be shifted is `input[row][0 : k]`.\n6.  **No Change Condition:** If a row has no repeating colors (after the first element), or if the row is an even-indexed row, it remains unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
