task_elements:
  - item: Input Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (colors)
      - contains a dominant background color (e.g., blue=1)
      - contains one or more foreground objects (contiguous pixels of non-background colors)
  - item: Foreground Objects
    properties:
      - composed of colors other than the background color
      - shapes can vary (rectangles, squares, single pixels)
      - maintain relative spatial positions
  - item: Background Color
    properties:
      - the most frequent color in the input grid
      - identified as blue=1 in the examples
  - item: Bounding Box
    properties:
      - the smallest rectangular area enclosing all foreground objects
  - item: Output Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions match the bounding box dimensions
      - contains the foreground objects from the input, preserving their relative positions
      - pixels corresponding to the input background color *within* the bounding box are replaced by white=0

transformation:
  - step: Identify the background color (most frequent color in the input).
  - step: Locate all pixels that are *not* the background color (these form the foreground objects).
  - step: Determine the minimum bounding box containing all identified foreground pixels.
  - step: Extract the subgrid defined by this bounding box from the input.
  - step: Create the output grid by replacing every pixel in the extracted subgrid that matches the background color with white=0. Other pixels remain unchanged.

relationships:
  - The output grid's content is derived solely from the portion of the input grid within the bounding box.
  - The position of foreground objects relative to each other is preserved from input to output.
  - The background color within the relevant area (bounding box) is consistently replaced by white=0.
