            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\nThe input grids consist primarily of a single background color (blue=1 in all examples). Embedded within this background are one or more distinct \"objects\" represented by contiguous blocks of other colors (green=3, red=2, gray=5, magenta=6). The task seems to involve isolating these non-background objects and presenting them in the output grid. The relative spatial arrangement of these objects is preserved. The key transformation appears to be identifying the minimal area containing all non-background objects and then removing or replacing the background color within that area. Specifically, the background color pixels (blue=1) within the minimal bounding box of the non-background objects are replaced with white (0) in the output. The output grid's size corresponds exactly to the size of this minimal bounding box.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
