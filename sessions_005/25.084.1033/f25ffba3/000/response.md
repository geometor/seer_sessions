Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Dimensions**: Both input and output grids in the examples are 10 rows high and 4 columns wide.
2.  **Input Structure**: The top half (rows 0-4) of the input grids seems to be entirely composed of the background color (white, 0). The bottom half (rows 5-9) contains a pattern of various colors (red, green, azure, maroon, yellow).
3.  **Output Structure**: The output grids contain colored patterns in both the top half (rows 0-4) and the bottom half (rows 5-9).
4.  **Relationship**:
    *   The bottom half of the output grid appears identical to the bottom half of the corresponding input grid.
    *   The top half of the output grid appears to be a vertically flipped (mirrored across a horizontal axis) version of the bottom half of the input grid.
5.  **Color Preservation**: All colors present in the relevant section (bottom half) of the input grid are preserved in the output grid. No new colors are introduced.
6.  **Implied Symmetry**: The transformation creates a vertical reflection symmetry centered around the horizontal line dividing the grid in half (between row 4 and row 5).

## Facts

transformation:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify input grid dimensions (Height H, Width W).
  - step: 2
    action: Calculate middle row index M = H // 2.
  - step: 3
    action: Extract the subgrid corresponding to the input_bottom_half (rows M to H-1).
    source: input_grid
    target_variable: bottom_pattern
  - step: 4
    action: Vertically flip the extracted subgrid 'bottom_pattern'.
    source: bottom_pattern
    target_variable: flipped_pattern
  - step: 5
    action: Create an output grid of dimensions H x W.
    initial_state: Undefined or background color.
  - step: 6
    action: Copy the 'flipped_pattern' into the output_top_half region (rows 0 to M-1).
    source: flipped_pattern
    target: output_grid
  - step: 7
    action: Copy the original 'bottom_pattern' into the output_bottom_half region (rows M to H-1).
    source: bottom_pattern

## Natural Language Program

1.  Given an input grid, determine its height (H) and width (W).
2.  Calculate the middle row index, M, which is the integer division of H by 2 (M = H // 2).
3.  Extract the portion of the input grid from row M down to the last row (H-1). Call this the `source_pattern`.
4.  Create a new grid, the `output_grid`, with the same dimensions (H x W) as the input grid.
5.  Create a vertically flipped version of the `source_pattern`. Call this the `flipped_pattern`.
6.  Place the `flipped_pattern` into the top half of the `output_grid`, filling rows 0 to M-1.
7.  Place the original `source_pattern` into the bottom half of the `output_grid`, filling rows M to H-1.
8.  Return the completed `output_grid`.
