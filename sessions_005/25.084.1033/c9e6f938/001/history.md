Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Each example pair consists of an input grid and a corresponding output grid.
2.  **Grid Dimensions:** The input grids in the examples are all 3x3. The corresponding output grids are all 3x6. This suggests the output grid's height matches the input's height, while the output's width is double the input's width.
3.  **Content Relationship:** Observing the content, the left half of the output grid (columns 0, 1, 2 for a 3x3 input) appears to be an exact copy of the input grid. The right half of the output grid (columns 3, 4, 5) looks like a horizontal reflection (mirror image) of the left half (or the original input grid).
4.  **Colors:** The grids primarily use white (0) and orange (7) pixels. The transformation seems independent of the specific colors used, applying the reflection rule regardless.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Horizontally reflect the input grid and append the reflection to the right of the original input.
grid_properties:
  - input_height: H
  - input_width: W
  - output_height: H
  - output_width: 2 * W
composition:
  - output_left_half: Identical to the input grid.
    - columns: 0 to W-1
  - output_right_half: Horizontal reflection of the input grid.
    - columns: W to 2*W-1
transformation:
  - type: Geometric reflection
  - axis: Vertical (reflection happens horizontally)
  - operation:
      - Copy input grid to the left side of the output grid.
      - Create a horizontally flipped copy of the input grid.
      - Place the flipped copy to the right side of the output grid.
color_invariance: The transformation applies regardless of the pixel colors present in the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
3.  Create a new output grid with height H and width (2 * W).
4.  For each row `r` from 0 to H-1 and each column `c` from 0 to W-1:
    a.  Copy the pixel value from the input grid at `(r, c)` to the output grid at `(r, c)`.
    b.  Copy the pixel value from the input grid at `(r, c)` to the output grid at `(r, (2 * W - 1) - c)`.
5.  Return the resulting output grid.
