```python
"""
Identify rows with red pixels and columns with azure pixels in the input grid. 
Project red horizontally across its entire row(s). 
Project azure vertically downwards in its column(s), starting from below the lowest original azure pixel in that column, extending to the bottom edge. 
Mark the intersections of the original azure columns and the red-projected rows with yellow.
Yellow takes precedence at intersections. Red takes precedence over projected azure otherwise. Original azure pixels are preserved.
