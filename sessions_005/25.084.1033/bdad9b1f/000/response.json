            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided example pair for this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids contain a white background (0), one or more azure (8) pixels, and one or more red (2) pixels. In the examples, the azure pixels form vertical line segments, and the red pixels form horizontal line segments.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids retain the original azure pixels. The red pixels seem to trigger a transformation. New red, azure, and yellow (4) pixels appear.\n3.  **Transformation - Red Pixels:** It appears that for every row containing a red pixel in the input, that entire row becomes red (2) in the output grid.\n4.  **Transformation - Azure Pixels:** For every column containing an azure pixel in the input, all cells *below* the lowest original azure pixel in that column become azure (8) in the output grid. The original azure pixels remain.\n5.  **Transformation - Interaction (Yellow Pixels):** The crucial observation is the appearance of yellow (4) pixels. These yellow pixels appear exactly at the intersection points: where a row that has been filled with red (due to step 3) crosses a column that originally contained an azure pixel (as identified in step 4).\n6.  **Precedence:** The yellow pixel takes precedence over both the projected red and the projected azure colors at the intersection points. The projected red color takes precedence over the projected azure color if they overlap outside the primary intersection column. The projected colors overwrite the original white background. The original azure pixels are preserved.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
