Okay, let's analyze the provided example pair for this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids contain a white background (0), one or more azure (8) pixels, and one or more red (2) pixels. In the examples, the azure pixels form vertical line segments, and the red pixels form horizontal line segments.
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids retain the original azure pixels. The red pixels seem to trigger a transformation. New red, azure, and yellow (4) pixels appear.
3.  **Transformation - Red Pixels:** It appears that for every row containing a red pixel in the input, that entire row becomes red (2) in the output grid.
4.  **Transformation - Azure Pixels:** For every column containing an azure pixel in the input, all cells *below* the lowest original azure pixel in that column become azure (8) in the output grid. The original azure pixels remain.
5.  **Transformation - Interaction (Yellow Pixels):** The crucial observation is the appearance of yellow (4) pixels. These yellow pixels appear exactly at the intersection points: where a row that has been filled with red (due to step 3) crosses a column that originally contained an azure pixel (as identified in step 4).
6.  **Precedence:** The yellow pixel takes precedence over both the projected red and the projected azure colors at the intersection points. The projected red color takes precedence over the projected azure color if they overlap outside the primary intersection column. The projected colors overwrite the original white background. The original azure pixels are preserved.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Identify rows with red pixels and columns with azure pixels in the input grid. Project red horizontally across its row(s) and azure vertically downwards in its column(s) below the original object. Mark intersections of red rows and original azure columns with yellow.

  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: object
    color: azure (8)

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find all unique row indices that contain at least one red (2) pixel in the input grid. Store these indices in a set called `red_rows`.
3.  Find all unique column indices that contain at least one azure (8) pixel in the input grid. Store these indices in a set called `azure_columns`.
4.  For each column index `c` in `azure_columns`:
    a. Determine the maximum row index `max_r` such that the input grid pixel at `(max_r, c)` is azure (8).
    b. Iterate through all row indices `r` from `max_r + 1` down to the bottom edge of the grid (height - 1).
    c. Set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to azure (8).
5.  For each row index `r` in `red_rows`:
    a. Iterate through all column indices `c` from the left edge (0) to the right edge of the grid (width - 1).
    b. Set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to red (2).
6.  For each row index `r` in `red_rows`:
    a. For each column index `c` in `azure_columns`:
       i. Set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to yellow (4). (This overwrites any color set in steps 4 or 5 at these specific intersection points).
7.  Return the final output grid.
