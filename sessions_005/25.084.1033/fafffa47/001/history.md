Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids are consistently 6 rows by 3 columns.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are consistently 3 rows by 3 columns.
3.  **Color Palette:**
    *   Inputs use: white (0), maroon (9), blue (1).
    *   Outputs use: white (0), red (2).
4.  **Spatial Relationship:** The input grid appears to be composed of two distinct 3x3 subgrids stacked vertically. The top 3x3 subgrid uses white (0) and maroon (9). The bottom 3x3 subgrid uses white (0) and blue (1). The output grid dimensions (3x3) match these subgrids.
5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The output grid seems to be generated by comparing the corresponding pixels of the top and bottom 3x3 subgrids of the input. Specifically, a red (2) pixel appears in the output only when *both* the corresponding pixel in the top subgrid *and* the corresponding pixel in the bottom subgrid are white (0). In all other cases (where at least one of the corresponding input pixels is non-white - either maroon (9) or blue (1)), the output pixel is white (0).

    condition: Check the color of the pixel at (row, col) in top_subgrid and bottom_subgrid.
    action:
      if top_subgrid[row, col] == white (0) AND bottom_subgrid[row, col] == white (0):
        set output_grid[row, col] to red (2)
      else:
        set output_grid[row, col] to white (0)
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Divide the 6x3 input grid into two 3x3 subgrids: the 'top grid' (rows 0 to 2) and the 'bottom grid' (rows 3 to 5).
2.  Create a new 3x3 output grid, initially filled with white (0).
3.  Iterate through each cell position (row `r`, column `c`) from (0, 0) to (2, 2).
4.  At each position (`r`, `c`), check the color of the pixel in the top grid and the color of the pixel in the bottom grid.
5.  If the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the top grid is white (0) AND the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the bottom grid is also white (0), then set the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to red (2).
6.  Otherwise (if either or both corresponding input pixels are not white), leave the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the output grid as white (0).
7.  Return the completed 3x3 output grid.
