    structure: Composed of two vertically stacked 3x3 subgrids.

      colors: [white (0), maroon (9)]
    subgrid_2: # Bottom subgrid (rows 3-5)

transformation:
  type: element-wise comparison between input subgrids
  input_elements:
    - name: top_subgrid
      source: Input grid rows 0-2
    - name: bottom_subgrid
      source: Input grid rows 3-5

  rule: For each coordinate (row, col) from (0,0) to (2,2):
    condition: Check the color of the pixel at (row, col) in top_subgrid and bottom_subgrid.
    action:
      if top_subgrid[row, col] == white (0) AND bottom_subgrid[row, col] == white (0):
        set output_grid[row, col] to red (2)
      else:
        set output_grid[row, col] to white (0)
