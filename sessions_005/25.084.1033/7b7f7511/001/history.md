*   **Perception:**
    *   Each input grid seems to contain a repeating pattern.
    *   In `train_1` and `train_2`, the input grid's width is double its height, and the right half of the grid is an exact copy of the left half. The output is the left half.
    *   In `train_3`, the input grid's height is triple its width (or rather, twice the height of the output), and the bottom half of the grid is an exact copy of the top half. The output is the top half.
    *   The transformation identifies whether the duplication occurs horizontally (left/right) or vertically (top/bottom) and extracts one of the identical halves.
    *   If horizontal duplication exists, the output is the left half.
    *   If vertical duplication exists, the output is the top half.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Identify if an input grid is composed of two identical halves, either horizontally or vertically, and extract one half as the output.
    
    examples:
      train_1:
        input_grid_dimensions: [3, 6] # height, width
        output_grid_dimensions: [3, 3]
        duplication_axis: horizontal # left and right halves are identical
        output_derivation: left half of the input grid
      train_2:
        input_grid_dimensions: [4, 8]
        output_grid_dimensions: [4, 4]
        duplication_axis: horizontal # left and right halves are identical
        output_derivation: left half of the input grid
      train_3:
        input_grid_dimensions: [6, 2]
        output_grid_dimensions: [3, 2]
        duplication_axis: vertical # top and bottom halves are identical
        output_derivation: top half of the input grid
    
    observations:
      - Input grids have either even width or even height.
      - If the width is even, check if the left half matches the right half.
      - If the height is even, check if the top half matches the bottom half.
      - The output grid is always half the size of the input grid along the axis of duplication.
      - The task assumes only one type of duplication (horizontal or vertical) will be present in a valid input.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input grid.
    2.  Determine the height (`H`) and width (`W`) of the input grid.
    3.  Check if the width (`W`) is even.
    4.  If `W` is even, divide the grid horizontally into a left half (columns 0 to `W/2 - 1`) and a right half (columns `W/2` to `W - 1`).
    5.  Compare the left half and the right half pixel by pixel.
    6.  If the left half is identical to the right half, the output is the left half.
    7.  If `W` is not even or the halves are not identical, check if the height (`H`) is even.
    8.  If `H` is even, divide the grid vertically into a top half (rows 0 to `H/2 - 1`) and a bottom half (rows `H/2` to `H - 1`).
    9.  Compare the top half and the bottom half pixel by pixel.
    10. If the top half is identical to the bottom half, the output is the top half.
    11. (Implicit assumption: One of the conditions in step 6 or step 10 will be met for valid inputs).
