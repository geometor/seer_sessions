- task_type: grid_transformation
- transformation: scaling
- input_properties:
    - type: grid
    - elements: pixels (colored cells)
    - dimensions: variable height (H) and width (W)
- output_properties:
    - type: grid
    - elements: pixels (colored cells)
    - dimensions: 2 * H (height), 2 * W (width)
- relationship:
    - each pixel at coordinate (r, c) in the input grid, with color C
    - corresponds to a 2x2 block of pixels in the output grid
    - the 2x2 block consists of pixels at coordinates (2r, 2c), (2r, 2c+1), (2r+1, 2c), and (2r+1, 2c+1)
    - all pixels within this 2x2 block have the same color C as the original input pixel
- scaling_factor: 2 (uniform in both dimensions)
