Comparing the input and output grids across all examples reveals a consistent pattern: the output grid is a scaled-up version of the input grid. Specifically, the output grid's height and width are exactly double the input grid's height and width. Each pixel in the input grid is expanded into a 2x2 square of the same color in the output grid. The relative positions of these 2x2 blocks in the output correspond to the positions of the original pixels in the input.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Iterate through each pixel in the input grid, identified by its row index `r` (from 0 to H-1) and column index `c` (from 0 to W-1).\n4.  For each input pixel at `(r, c)`, get its color value `C`.\n5.  In the output grid, fill a 2x2 block of pixels with the color `C`. The top-left corner of this block is at row `2*r` and column `2*c`. Specifically, set the color of the output pixels at coordinates `(2*r, 2*c)`, `(2*r, 2*c + 1)`, `(2*r + 1, 2*c)`, and `(2*r + 1, 2*c + 1)` to `C`.\n6.  Repeat steps 3-5 for all pixels in the input grid.\n7.  The resulting grid is the final output."
