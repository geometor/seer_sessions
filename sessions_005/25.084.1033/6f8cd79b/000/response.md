Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions. The input grids in all examples consist entirely of white pixels (0). The output grids are characterized by having an azure border (8) around the perimeter, while the interior pixels remain white (0). The size of the grid varies across examples, but the transformation rule remains consistent: create a one-pixel thick border of azure color.

**Facts:**


```yaml
# Facts derived from the examples

# Grid Properties
- input_grid:
    description: The starting grid for the transformation.
    properties:
      - dimensions: Variable height and width (e.g., 5x4, 4x3, 5x6, 3x3).
      - content: Consists entirely of white pixels (value 0).
- output_grid:
    description: The resulting grid after the transformation.
    properties:
      - dimensions: Identical to the corresponding input grid dimensions.
      - content:
          - border: A one-pixel thick frame of azure pixels (value 8) along the perimeter.
          - interior: The pixels enclosed by the border retain the original input color (value 0).

# Transformation Details
- transformation_name: Create Border
- input_element: Entire input grid.
- output_element: A new grid with a border.
- rule:
    description: Change the color of the pixels located at the edges (first row, last row, first column, last column) of the grid to azure (8). Leave the interior pixels unchanged (white, 0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Copy the content of the input grid to the output grid.
3.  Identify the boundary pixels of the output grid:
    *   All pixels in the first row (row index 0).
    *   All pixels in the last row (row index height - 1).
    *   All pixels in the first column (column index 0).
    *   All pixels in the last column (column index width - 1).
4.  Change the color of all identified boundary pixels to azure (8).
5.  The resulting grid is the final output.
