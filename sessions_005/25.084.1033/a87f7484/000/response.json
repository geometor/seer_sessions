The outputs are consistently 3x3 grids.\n2.  **Input Content:** The input grids contain multiple distinct 3x3 patterns or \"objects\". Each pattern consists of white pixels (0) and pixels of one other specific color.\n3.  **Pattern Arrangement:** These 3x3 patterns can be arranged horizontally (separated by white columns, as in examples 1 and 2) or vertically (sometimes separated by white rows, sometimes stacked directly, as in examples 3 and 4).\n4.  **Output Content:** The output grid is always identical to one of the 3x3 patterns present in the input grid.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The core task seems to be selecting *which* 3x3 pattern from the input becomes the output. Observing the examples, the selection appears related to the frequency of colors in the *entire* input grid. Specifically, the non-white color that appears most frequently across the whole input grid determines which 3x3 pattern is chosen. The output is the unique 3x3 pattern constructed using white (0) and this most frequent non-white color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
