task_elements:
  - element: grid
    attributes:
      - type: input, output
      - format: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors
      - size: variable (input), 3x3 (output)

  - element: color
    attributes:
      - represented_by: integers 0-9
      - role: background (white, 0), foreground (non-white, 1-9)
      - property: frequency (count of pixels of a specific color in the input grid)

  - element: pattern
    description: A distinct 3x3 subgrid within the input.
    attributes:
      - size: 3x3
      - composition: Consists of white pixels (0) and pixels of exactly one other non-white color (pattern_color).
      - location: Can appear anywhere within the input grid.
      - relation_to_output: One specific pattern from the input becomes the output.

  - element: selection_rule
    description: The process to determine which input pattern becomes the output.
    based_on: The frequency of non-white colors in the entire input grid.
    logic: The pattern selected corresponds to the non-white color with the highest frequency.

relationships:
  - type: selection
    subject: pattern
    object: output grid
    condition: The pattern's non-white color (pattern_color) is the most frequent non-white color in the entire input grid.
