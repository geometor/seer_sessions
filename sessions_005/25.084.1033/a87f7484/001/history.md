Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The inputs are grids of varying dimensions (e.g., 3x15, 3x12, 12x3, 9x3). The outputs are consistently 3x3 grids.
2.  **Input Content:** The input grids contain multiple distinct 3x3 patterns or "objects". Each pattern consists of white pixels (0) and pixels of one other specific color.
3.  **Pattern Arrangement:** These 3x3 patterns can be arranged horizontally (separated by white columns, as in examples 1 and 2) or vertically (sometimes separated by white rows, sometimes stacked directly, as in examples 3 and 4).
4.  **Output Content:** The output grid is always identical to one of the 3x3 patterns present in the input grid.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The core task seems to be selecting *which* 3x3 pattern from the input becomes the output. Observing the examples, the selection appears related to the frequency of colors in the *entire* input grid. Specifically, the non-white color that appears most frequently across the whole input grid determines which 3x3 pattern is chosen. The output is the unique 3x3 pattern constructed using white (0) and this most frequent non-white color.

## Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - element: grid
    attributes:
      - type: input, output
      - format: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors
      - size: variable (input), 3x3 (output)

  - element: color
    attributes:
      - represented_by: integers 0-9
      - role: background (white, 0), foreground (non-white, 1-9)
      - property: frequency (count of pixels of a specific color in the input grid)

  - element: pattern
    description: A distinct 3x3 subgrid within the input.
    attributes:
      - size: 3x3
      - composition: Consists of white pixels (0) and pixels of exactly one other non-white color (pattern_color).
      - location: Can appear anywhere within the input grid.
      - relation_to_output: One specific pattern from the input becomes the output.

  - element: selection_rule
    description: The process to determine which input pattern becomes the output.
    based_on: The frequency of non-white colors in the entire input grid.
    logic: The pattern selected corresponds to the non-white color with the highest frequency.

relationships:
  - type: selection
    subject: pattern
    object: output grid
    condition: The pattern's non-white color (pattern_color) is the most frequent non-white color in the entire input grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Analyze the input grid and count the total occurrences of each non-white color (colors 1 through 9).
2.  Identify the non-white color that has the highest frequency count across the entire input grid. Let this be the `target_color`.
3.  Search the input grid for a 3x3 subgrid that contains only white pixels (color 0) and pixels of the `target_color`.
4.  Return this identified 3x3 subgrid as the output grid. (It is assumed there will be only one unique pattern structure associated with the most frequent color).
