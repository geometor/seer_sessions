"""
Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized with white (0).
Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the input grid. If the cell's color C is not white (0),
set the color of the corresponding cell (c, r) in the output grid to C.
This effectively reflects the non-white pixels across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).
