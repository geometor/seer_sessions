facts:
  - grid_properties:
      - input_output_size_match: true
      - background_color: white (0)
  - objects:
      - type: pixel
      - properties:
          - color: Any non-white color (1-9)
          - role: foreground element
      - type: pixel
      - properties:
          - color: white (0)
          - role: background
  - relationships:
      - geometric: The transformation involves coordinates (row, column).
      - mapping: Each non-white input pixel at (row, column) determines the color of the output pixel at (column, row).
  - actions:
      - reflection: Non-white pixels are reflected across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).
      - initialization: The output grid starts as all white.
      - assignment: The color of a non-white input pixel at (r, c) is assigned to the output pixel at (c, r).
