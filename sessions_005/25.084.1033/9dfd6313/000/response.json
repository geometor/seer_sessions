            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are square, although the size varies between examples (4x4, 3x3, 5x5). The output grid always has the same dimensions as the corresponding input grid.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary background color is white (0). Various other colors (gray-5, magenta-6, yellow-4, green-3, azure-8, red-2, blue-1) appear as foreground elements.\n3.  **Main Diagonal:** In all examples, there's a prominent diagonal line of gray (5) pixels running from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. These gray pixels maintain their exact positions in the output grid.\n4.  **Other Colored Pixels:** Other non-white, non-gray pixels exist in the input grids. In the output grids, these pixels appear to have moved.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:** Comparing the positions of the non-gray colored pixels between input and output reveals a consistent pattern: a pixel at `(row, column)` in the input moves to `(column, row)` in the output. This is a reflection across the main diagonal.\n6.  **Background Filling:** The original positions of the moved pixels (those not on the main diagonal) become white (0) in the output grid. All other white pixels in the input remain white in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
