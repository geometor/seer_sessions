Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are square, although the size varies between examples (4x4, 3x3, 5x5). The output grid always has the same dimensions as the corresponding input grid.
2.  **Colors:** The primary background color is white (0). Various other colors (gray-5, magenta-6, yellow-4, green-3, azure-8, red-2, blue-1) appear as foreground elements.
3.  **Main Diagonal:** In all examples, there's a prominent diagonal line of gray (5) pixels running from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. These gray pixels maintain their exact positions in the output grid.
4.  **Other Colored Pixels:** Other non-white, non-gray pixels exist in the input grids. In the output grids, these pixels appear to have moved.
5.  **Transformation Pattern:** Comparing the positions of the non-gray colored pixels between input and output reveals a consistent pattern: a pixel at `(row, column)` in the input moves to `(column, row)` in the output. This is a reflection across the main diagonal.
6.  **Background Filling:** The original positions of the moved pixels (those not on the main diagonal) become white (0) in the output grid. All other white pixels in the input remain white in the output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - grid_properties:
      - input_output_size_match: true
      - background_color: white (0)
  - objects:
      - type: pixel
      - properties:
          - color: Any non-white color (1-9)
          - role: foreground element
      - type: pixel
      - properties:
          - color: white (0)
          - role: background
  - relationships:
      - geometric: The transformation involves coordinates (row, column).
      - mapping: Each non-white input pixel at (row, column) determines the color of the output pixel at (column, row).
  - actions:
      - reflection: Non-white pixels are reflected across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).
      - initialization: The output grid starts as all white.
      - assignment: The color of a non-white input pixel at (r, c) is assigned to the output pixel at (c, r).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid (the "output grid") with the same dimensions as the input grid, and fill it entirely with the background color white (0).
2.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid, identifying its row index `r`, column index `c`, and color `C`.
3.  If the color `C` is not white (0):
    a.  Locate the cell in the output grid with row index `c` and column index `r`.
    b.  Set the color of this output grid cell `output[c][r]` to `C`.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
