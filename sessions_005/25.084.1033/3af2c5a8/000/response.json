These blocks seem related to the input grid through reflections.\n4.  **Block Analysis**:\n    *   The top-left block of the output grid is identical to the input grid.\n    *   The top-right block is a horizontal reflection (mirror image across the vertical axis) of the input grid.\n    *   The bottom-left block is a vertical reflection (mirror image across the horizontal axis) of the input grid.\n    *   The bottom-right block is both a horizontal and vertical reflection (equivalent to a 180-degree rotation) of the input grid.\n5.  **Consistency**: This pattern of creating a 2x2 arrangement of the input and its reflections holds true across all three training examples, regardless of the specific colors or patterns within the input grid.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
