Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and describe the transformation logic.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids**: Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with values representing colors (white, green, azure).
2.  **Dimensionality Change**: In all examples, the output grid's dimensions are exactly double the input grid's dimensions (e.g., 3x4 input becomes 6x8 output).
3.  **Pattern Recognition**: The output grid appears to be composed of four blocks, each the size of the original input grid. These blocks seem related to the input grid through reflections.
4.  **Block Analysis**:
    *   The top-left block of the output grid is identical to the input grid.
    *   The top-right block is a horizontal reflection (mirror image across the vertical axis) of the input grid.
    *   The bottom-left block is a vertical reflection (mirror image across the horizontal axis) of the input grid.
    *   The bottom-right block is both a horizontal and vertical reflection (equivalent to a 180-degree rotation) of the input grid.
5.  **Consistency**: This pattern of creating a 2x2 arrangement of the input and its reflections holds true across all three training examples, regardless of the specific colors or patterns within the input grid.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: Construct an output grid by tiling transformed versions of the input grid.
grid_properties:
  - input: 2D grid of pixels (colors 0-9)
  - output: 2D grid of pixels (colors 0-9)
dimensional_relationship:
  - output_height: input_height * 2
  - output_width: input_width * 2
transformation:
  type: Tiling and Reflection
  steps:
    - Define four quadrants in the output grid, each the size of the input grid.
    - Quadrant 1 (Top-Left): Copy the original input grid.
    - Quadrant 2 (Top-Right): Copy the input grid flipped horizontally.
    - Quadrant 3 (Bottom-Left): Copy the input grid flipped vertically.
    - Quadrant 4 (Bottom-Right): Copy the input grid flipped both horizontally and vertically.
objects:
  - The entire input grid acts as the primary object or pattern unit.
actions:
  - Copying the input grid.
  - Flipping the input grid horizontally.
  - Flipping the input grid vertically.
  - Arranging these transformed grids into a larger 2x2 grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height (`H`) and width (`W`) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with height `2 * H` and width `2 * W`.
3.  Copy the original input grid into the top-left quadrant of the output grid (rows 0 to `H-1`, columns 0 to `W-1`).
4.  Create a horizontally flipped version of the input grid.
5.  Copy this horizontally flipped grid into the top-right quadrant of the output grid (rows 0 to `H-1`, columns `W` to `2*W-1`).
6.  Create a vertically flipped version of the input grid.
7.  Copy this vertically flipped grid into the bottom-left quadrant of the output grid (rows `H` to `2*H-1`, columns 0 to `W-1`).
8.  Create a version of the input grid flipped both horizontally and vertically (or rotate the original 180 degrees).
9.  Copy this doubly flipped grid into the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid (rows `H` to `2*H-1`, columns `W` to `2*W-1`).
10. Return the completed output grid.
