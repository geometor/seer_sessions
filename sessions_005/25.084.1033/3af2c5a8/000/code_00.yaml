task_description: Construct an output grid by tiling transformed versions of the input grid.
grid_properties:
  - input: 2D grid of pixels (colors 0-9)
  - output: 2D grid of pixels (colors 0-9)
dimensional_relationship:
  - output_height: input_height * 2
  - output_width: input_width * 2
transformation:
  type: Tiling and Reflection
  steps:
    - Define four quadrants in the output grid, each the size of the input grid.
    - Quadrant 1 (Top-Left): Copy the original input grid.
    - Quadrant 2 (Top-Right): Copy the input grid flipped horizontally.
    - Quadrant 3 (Bottom-Left): Copy the input grid flipped vertically.
    - Quadrant 4 (Bottom-Right): Copy the input grid flipped both horizontally and vertically.
objects:
  - The entire input grid acts as the primary object or pattern unit.
actions:
  - Copying the input grid.
  - Flipping the input grid horizontally.
  - Flipping the input grid vertically.
  - Arranging these transformed grids into a larger 2x2 grid.
