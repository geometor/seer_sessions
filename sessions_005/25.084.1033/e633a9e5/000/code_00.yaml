Grid Transformation:
  Input Grid:
    Type: 2D Array (Grid)
    Dimensions: 3x3
    Cells: Pixels with color values (0-9)
  Output Grid:
    Type: 2D Array (Grid)
    Dimensions: 5x5
    Cells: Pixels with color values (0-9)
  Transformation Rule: Positional Scaling
    Scaling Factors:
      Vertical (sv):
        - 2, if pixel row is 0 or H-1 (where H=3)
        - 1, otherwise
      Horizontal (sh):
        - 2, if pixel column is 0 or W-1 (where W=3)
        - 1, otherwise
    Process:
      1. Initialize an empty output grid with dimensions calculated by summing scale factors across rows and columns (Sum(sv) x Sum(sh) = 5x5).
      2. Iterate through each pixel `P` at `(row, col)` in the input grid.
      3. Determine the vertical scale factor `sv` and horizontal scale factor `sh` for `P` based on its `row` and `col`.
      4. Calculate the starting position `(out_row, out_col)` for the scaled block in the output grid based on the cumulative sum of scale factors of preceding pixels.
      5. Fill the region in the output grid from `(out_row, out_col)` with dimensions `sv x sh` with the color of pixel `P`.
  Relationship:
    - The output grid structure is a direct result of applying position-dependent scaling factors to each input pixel.
    - The color of each block in the output grid corresponds to the color of the single pixel it originates from in the input grid.
