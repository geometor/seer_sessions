**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 input grid into a 5x5 output grid. Observing the examples, it appears that each pixel in the input grid is expanded or scaled into a block of pixels in the output grid. The size of this block depends on the position of the original pixel in the input grid. Pixels located on the edges and corners of the input grid seem to be expanded more than the pixel in the center.

Specifically:
- Pixels in the first and last rows of the input are duplicated vertically (scaled 2x vertically).
- Pixels in the first and last columns of the input are duplicated horizontally (scaled 2x horizontally).
- Pixels not on the edges (i.e., the center pixel in this 3x3 case) are not duplicated (scaled 1x).

This results in:
- Corner pixels (e.g., top-left) being scaled into 2x2 blocks.
- Middle-edge pixels (e.g., top-middle) being scaled into 2x1 blocks (if top/bottom edge) or 1x2 blocks (if left/right edge).
- The center pixel being copied as a 1x1 block.

The output grid is constructed by placing these scaled blocks adjacent to each other, maintaining the relative order of the original input pixels.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid Transformation:
  Input Grid:
    Type: 2D Array (Grid)
    Dimensions: 3x3
    Cells: Pixels with color values (0-9)
  Output Grid:
    Type: 2D Array (Grid)
    Dimensions: 5x5
    Cells: Pixels with color values (0-9)
  Transformation Rule: Positional Scaling
    Scaling Factors:
      Vertical (sv):
        - 2, if pixel row is 0 or H-1 (where H=3)
        - 1, otherwise
      Horizontal (sh):
        - 2, if pixel column is 0 or W-1 (where W=3)
        - 1, otherwise
    Process:
      1. Initialize an empty output grid with dimensions calculated by summing scale factors across rows and columns (Sum(sv) x Sum(sh) = 5x5).
      2. Iterate through each pixel `P` at `(row, col)` in the input grid.
      3. Determine the vertical scale factor `sv` and horizontal scale factor `sh` for `P` based on its `row` and `col`.
      4. Calculate the starting position `(out_row, out_col)` for the scaled block in the output grid based on the cumulative sum of scale factors of preceding pixels.
      5. Fill the region in the output grid from `(out_row, out_col)` with dimensions `sv x sh` with the color of pixel `P`.
  Relationship:
    - The output grid structure is a direct result of applying position-dependent scaling factors to each input pixel.
    - The color of each block in the output grid corresponds to the color of the single pixel it originates from in the input grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Define the vertical scaling factor (`sv`) for an input pixel based on its row index (`r`): if `r` is the first row (0) or the last row (2), `sv` is 2; otherwise, `sv` is 1.
2.  Define the horizontal scaling factor (`sh`) for an input pixel based on its column index (`c`): if `c` is the first column (0) or the last column (2), `sh` is 2; otherwise, `sh` is 1.
3.  Calculate the dimensions of the output grid: the height is the sum of `sv` for all rows (2+1+2=5), and the width is the sum of `sh` for all columns (2+1+2=5). Create an empty 5x5 output grid.
4.  Initialize the current output row pointer (`current_out_row`) to 0.
5.  Iterate through each row (`r`) of the input grid (from 0 to 2):
    a.  Initialize the current output column pointer (`current_out_col`) to 0.
    b.  Determine the vertical scale factor `sv` for the current row `r`.
    c.  Iterate through each column (`c`) of the input grid (from 0 to 2):
        i.   Get the color (`color`) of the input pixel at `(r, c)`.
        ii.  Determine the horizontal scale factor `sh` for the current column `c`.
        iii. Fill the rectangular region in the output grid starting at `(current_out_row, current_out_col)` with height `sv` and width `sh` using the `color`.
        iv.  Increment `current_out_col` by `sh`.
    d.  Increment `current_out_row` by `sv`.
6.  Return the completed output grid.
