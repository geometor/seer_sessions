            "text": "**Perception:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a 3x3 input grid into a 5x5 output grid. Observing the examples, it appears that each pixel in the input grid is expanded or scaled into a block of pixels in the output grid. The size of this block depends on the position of the original pixel in the input grid. Pixels located on the edges and corners of the input grid seem to be expanded more than the pixel in the center.\n\nSpecifically:\n- Pixels in the first and last rows of the input are duplicated vertically (scaled 2x vertically).\n- Pixels in the first and last columns of the input are duplicated horizontally (scaled 2x horizontally).\n- Pixels not on the edges (i.e., the center pixel in this 3x3 case) are not duplicated (scaled 1x).\n\nThis results in:\n- Corner pixels (e.g., top-left) being scaled into 2x2 blocks.\n- Middle-edge pixels (e.g., top-middle) being scaled into 2x1 blocks (if top/bottom edge) or 1x2 blocks (if left/right edge).\n- The center pixel being copied as a 1x1 block.\n\nThe output grid is constructed by placing these scaled blocks adjacent to each other, maintaining the relative order of the original input pixels.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
