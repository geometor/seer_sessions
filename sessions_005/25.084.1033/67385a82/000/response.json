            "text": "*   **Perception**: The task involves transforming grids containing white (0) and green (3) pixels into grids containing white (0), green (3), and azure (8) pixels. The transformation specifically targets some of the green pixels, changing their color to azure, while leaving white pixels and other green pixels unchanged. The core challenge is to identify the rule that determines which green pixels are transformed. By analyzing the examples, it appears the transformation is related to the concept of connected components of green pixels, where connectivity includes both orthogonal and diagonal neighbors. The green pixels belonging to the single largest connected component (by pixel count) are the ones that change color to azure.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
