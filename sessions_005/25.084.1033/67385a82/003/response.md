"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
1. Identify all connected components of green pixels (value 3) using 4-way (von Neumann) adjacency.
2. Select components with a size (number of pixels) of 3 or more.
3. For each selected component:
    a. Check if it consists *exactly* of 5 pixels forming a 2x2 square plus one additional green pixel connected (4-way) to exactly one pixel of the square (a "tail").
    b. If it is the specific "2x2 plus tail" shape (size 5), mark only the 4 pixels forming the 2x2 square for color change.
    c. Otherwise (if the component size is >= 3 but not the specific "2x2 plus tail" shape), mark all pixels in the component for color change.
4. Change the color of all marked pixels from green (3) to azure (8).
