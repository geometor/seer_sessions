            "text": "## Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core concept of finding connected green components and changing their color based on size. However, it derived an overly specific rule (\"2x2 plus tail\") from the first example, which caused it to fail on that same example while coincidentally working for the others.\n\nThe failure on Example 1, where the code *correctly* identified the \"2x2 plus tail\" shape but only colored the square part, while the expected output colored the entire shape, indicates that the special rule was incorrect. The success on the other examples suggests the underlying principle of component size is likely correct, but the special shape handling needs removal.\n\nThe simplest hypothesis that fits all examples is: Identify all 4-way connected green components. If a component consists of 3 or more pixels, change all pixels in that component to azure.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Verify the component sizes for each input using 4-way connectivity.\n2.  Confirm that changing all green pixels in components of size >= 3 to azure matches the expected output for all examples.\n3.  Update the natural language program and facts based on this simpler, verified rule.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze the green components (value 3) using 4-way connectivity in each training input.\n\n"
