task_description: Identify specific groups of green pixels and change their color based on the group's size.

definitions:
  - object: Green Component
    description: A contiguous group of green (3) pixels connected using 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
    properties:
      - size: The number of pixels in the component.

transformations:
  - action: Identify Green Components
    input: Input grid
    output: A list of Green Components.
    condition: Pixels must be green (3) and connected 4-way.

  - action: Filter Components by Size
    input: List of Green Components
    output: Filtered list of Green Components.
    condition: Component size must be greater than or equal to 3.

  - action: Change Color
    input: Filtered list of Green Components and the original grid.
    output: Modified grid.
    rule: For each pixel coordinate within the filtered components, change its color in the grid from green (3) to azure (8).
    condition: The pixel's original color is green.

constants:
  - input_color: green (3)
  - output_color: azure (8)
  - size_threshold: 3
  - connectivity: 4-way (von Neumann)
