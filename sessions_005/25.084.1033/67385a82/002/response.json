            "text": "**Analysis Refinement:**\n\nMy code execution reveals an error in my manual 4-way component identification for Example 1.\nThe code found:\n*   Comp A: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0) - Size 5\n*   Comp B: (2,3), (3,2), (3,3) - Size 3\n*   Comp C: (0,3) - Size 1\n\nLet's re-trace 4-way connectivity for the first component:\n(0,0) connects to (0,1) and (1,0).\n(0,1) connects to (0,0) and (1,1).\n(1,0) connects to (0,0) and (1,1).\n(1,1) connects to (0,1), (1,0).\n(2,0) connects only to (1,0). Ah, I see. (2,0) IS 4-way connected to (1,0).\nSo, the 4-way components are indeed Size 5, Size 3, and Size 1.\n\nNow, let's re-evaluate the hypothesis: \"Change all green pixels belonging to any 4-way connected component of size 3 or greater to azure.\"\n*   Example 1: Components are size 5, 3, 1. Apply to size 5 and size 3 components.\n    *   Pixels: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3).\n    *   Expected Azure: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3).\n    *   Difference: The hypothesis incorrectly includes (2,0). **Hypothesis is wrong.**\n\n*   The tool code also confirms that the previous Python code *did* correctly implement the \"find largest 8-way component and change its color\" logic, matching the Transformed Outputs provided.\n\n**New Hypothesis Generation:**\n\nThe core issue remains: why is the transformation selective, especially in Example 1 where the largest 4-way component (size 5) is only partially changed, and the second largest (size 3) is fully changed?\n\nLet's look at the shapes/properties again.\n*   Example 1:\n    *   Input Green: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (0,3), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)\n    *   Output Azure: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)\n    *   Pixels changed: A 2x2 block and an L-shape of 3 pixels.\n    *   Pixels NOT changed (but green): (2,0), (0,3).\n    *   Why is (2,0) different? It's attached to the 2x2 block.\n    *   Why is (0,3) different? It's isolated (using 4-way).\n    *   What if the rule is specifically about 2x2 blocks?\n        *   Find all 2x2 blocks made entirely of green. Change those pixels? -> Changes (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Doesn't explain (2,3), (3,2), (3,3).\n    *   Find all 2x2 blocks containing *at least 3* green pixels?\n        *   Block at (0,0): (0,0 G), (0,1 G), (1,0 G), (1,1 G) -> Yes (4 green)\n        *   Block at (0,2): (0,2 W), (0,3 G), (1,2 W), (1,3 W) -> No (1 green)\n        *   Block at (1,0): (1,0 G), (1,1 G), (2,0 G), (2,1 W) -> Yes (3 green)\n        *   Block at (2,2): (2,2 W), (2,3 G), (3,2 G), (3,3 G) -> Yes (3 green)\n    *   Let's list the green pixels involved in these \">=3 green\" 2x2 blocks:\n        *   Block (0,0): (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\n        *   Block (1,0): (1,0), (1,1), (2,0)\n        *   Block (2,2): (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)\n    *   Total unique green pixels involved: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3).\n    *   This set *almost* matches the expected azure pixels. It includes (2,0), which should remain green.\n    *   Why is (2,0) excluded from the change?\n        *   Consider the 2x2 block definition again. A 2x2 block is defined by its top-left corner (r, c) and includes (r, c), (r+1, c), (r, c+1), (r+1, c+1).\n        *   Block (0,0): Has 4 green. Pixels: (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1).\n        *   Block (1,0): Has 3 green. Pixels: (1,0), (2,0), (1,1), (2,1 is 0). Green pixels: (1,0), (2,0), (1,1).\n        *   Block (2,2): Has 3 green. Pixels: (2,2 is 0), (3,2), (2,3), (3,3). Green pixels: (3,2), (2,3), (3,3).\n    *   Hypothesis: Find all 2x2 squares in the grid. If a 2x2 square contains exactly 3 green pixels, change those 3 green pixels to azure. If a 2x2 square contains exactly 4 green pixels, change those 4 green pixels to azure.\n    *   Let's test this:\n        *   Example 1:\n            *   Block (0,0): 4 green -> Change (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1) to 8.\n            *   Block (1,0): 3 green -> Change (1,0), (2,0), (1,1) to 8.\n            *   Block (2,2): 3 green -> Change (3,2), (2,3), (3,3) to 8.\n            *   Combined pixels to change: (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (3,2), (2,3), (3,3).\n            *   This still includes (2,0). Doesn't work.\n\n**Alternative View:** Look at the pixels that *don't* change.\n*   Ex 1: (2,0) and (0,3) remain green.\n*   Ex 2: (0,5), (2,4), (3,1) remain green.\n*   Ex 3: (1,4), (2,0), (4,5) remain green.\n*   Ex 4: (2,0), (2,2) remain green.\n\nThese are all the green pixels that belong to 4-way connected components of size 1 or 2.\n*   Ex 1: Components A(5), B(3), C(1). Pixel (0,3) is C(1). Pixel (2,0) is part of A(5). Doesn't fit.\nLet's re-run the 4-way component check as my manual check was wrong.\nOutput from tool_code:\n*   Ex 1: Comps: Size 5 [(0,0)...(2,0)], Size 3 [(2,3)...], Size 1 [(0,3)]. Pixels NOT changed: (2,0) [from size 5 comp], (0,3) [from size 1 comp].\n*   Ex 2: Comps: Size 4 [(0,1)...], Size 1 [(0,5)], Size 1 [(2,4)], Size 1 [(3,1)]. Pixels NOT changed: (0,5), (2,4), (3,1) [all size 1 comps].\n*   Ex 3: Comps: Size 4 [(3,1)...], Size 3 [(0,0)...], Size 1 [(1,4)], Size 1 [(2,0)], Size 1 [(4,5)]. Pixels NOT changed: (1,4), (2,0), (4,5) [all size 1 comps].\n*   Ex 4: Comps: Size 3 [(0,0)...], Size 1 [(2,0)], Size 1 [(2,2)]. Pixels NOT changed: (2,0), (2,2) [all size 1 comps].\n\nIt seems the rule is: Find all 4-way connected components. Change all pixels in components of size 3 or more, EXCEPT for the specific pixel (2,0) in Example 1. This isn't a general rule.\n\nWhat is special about (2,0) in Example 1?\nGrid 1:\n"

For each component of size 3 or greater, change the color of all pixels within that component to azure, *unless* a pixel has only one green 4-way neighbor within that component.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Comp A (size 5): (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0).\n        *   (0,0) has neighbors (0,1), (1,0) in comp -> 2 green neighbors.

Change.\n        *   (2,0) has neighbor (1,0) in comp -> 1 green neighbor. **Do NOT change.**\n    *   Comp B (size 3): (2,3), (3,2), (3,3).\n        *   (2,3) has neighbor (3,3) in comp -> 1 green neighbor. **Do NOT change.**\n        *   (3,2) has neighbor (3,3) in comp -> 1 green neighbor. **Do NOT change.**\n        *   (3,3) has neighbors (2,3), (3,2) in comp -> 2 green neighbors. Change.\n    *   Pixels changed by this rule: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (3,3).\n    *   Expected Azure: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3).\n    *   This doesn't work either. It fails to change (2,3) and (3,2) and changes only (3,3) from the second component.\n\nLet's discard the \"number of green neighbors\" idea for now.\n\nWhat if the connectivity is different? The initial code used 8-way (Moore). The analysis suggested 4-way (von Neumann). What if it's a mix?\n\nLook at the components identified by the original code (8-way largest):\n*   Ex 1: Comp: {(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0)}, Size 5. Code changed these. Expected changed {(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)} AND {(2,3), (3,2), (3,3)}.\n*   Ex 2: Comp: {(0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,4)}, Size 5. Code changed these. Expected changed {(0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)}.\n*   Ex 3: Comp: {(0,0),..,(4,2)}, Size 8. Code changed these. Expected changed {(0,0), (0,1), (1,1)} AND {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}.\n*   Ex 4: Comp: {(0,0),..,(2,2)}, Size 5. Code changed these. Expected changed {(0,0), (0,1), (1,1)}.\n\nThe failure pattern is consistent: the 8-way largest component often includes pixels that *should not* be changed, and sometimes excludes pixels that *should* be changed (as in Ex 1).\n\nMaybe the rule involves identifying *specific shapes* made of green pixels.\nThe 2x2 block appeared relevant.\n*   Ex 1: Has a 2x2 green block at (0,0). Expected output changes these 4 pixels. Also changes the L-shape (2,3), (3,2), (3,3).\n*   Ex 2: No 2x2 green block. Expected output changes (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) - an inverted T-shape.\n*   Ex 3: No 2x2 green block. Expected output changes (0,0), (0,1), (1,1) - an L-shape. Also changes (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2) - a 2x2 block! Wait, let me check the input grid 3 again.\n    "

Only Ex 1 failed, specifically because (2,0) was included but shouldn't have been.\n\nRule: Find all 4-way connected components of green pixels. Identify components C such that size(C) >= 3. The output pixels are the union of all pixels in such components C, *minus* any pixel P if P belongs to a component C (size >= 3) AND P has only one 4-way neighbor that also belongs to C.\n\nLet's re-test this precisely:\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Comp A (size 5): {(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0)}. Size >= 3.\n    *   Comp B (size 3): {(2,3), (3,2), (3,3)}. Size >= 3.\n    *   Comp C (size 1): {(0,3)}.

(2 neighbors). Keep.\n            *   (0,1): Neighbors (0,0), (1,1) in A. (2 neighbors). Keep.\n            *   (1,0): Neighbors (0,0), (1,1), (2,0) in A. (3 neighbors). Keep.\n            *   (1,1): Neighbors (0,1), (1,0) in A. (2 neighbors). Keep.\n            *   (2,0): Neighbor (1,0) in A.

(1 neighbor). **Remove (3,2).**\n            *   (3,3): Neighbors (2,3), (3,2) in B. (2 neighbors).

It removes too many pixels.\n\nLet's revisit the idea: \"Find all 4-way connected components of green pixels. Change the color of all pixels belonging to the two largest components to azure.\"\n*   Ex 1: Sizes 5, 3, 1. Largest two are 5 and 3. Pixels: {(0,0),..,(2,0)} U {(2,3),..,(3,3)}. Total 8 pixels. Expected output has 7 azure pixels (excludes 2,0). Fails.\n*   Ex 2: Sizes 4, 1, 1, 1. Largest two are 4 and 1. Which size 1? Ambiguous. If we only take unique sizes, largest are 4 and 1. Change comp size 4. Change *all* comps size 1? No. Just change the size 4 comp? Matches output.\n*   Ex 3: Sizes 4, 3, 1, 1, 1. Largest two are 4 and 3. Pixels: {(3,1)...} U {(0,0)...}. Total 7 pixels. Matches output.\n*   Ex 4: Sizes 3, 1, 1. Largest two are 3 and 1. Ambiguous. Change only size 3? Matches output.\n\nThis suggests a rule like: \"Find all 4-way connected components of green pixels. Identify the largest component (size L1) and the second largest component (size L2, where L2 < L1). Change pixels in the largest component. If L2 >= 3, also change pixels in the second largest component.\"\n*   Ex 1: Sizes 5, 3, 1. L1=5, L2=3. L2>=3 is true. Change comps of size 5 and 3. Pixels: {(0,0)...(2,0)} U {(2,3)...(3,3)}. Still includes (2,0). Fails.\n\nWhat if the definition of component or connectivity changes based on context?\n\nConsider the goal: transforming green pixels to azure. Maybe some green pixels are \"protected\"?\nWhich green pixels are *never* changed?\n(0,3) in Ex1. (0,5), (2,4), (3,1) in Ex2. (1,4), (2,0), (4,5) in Ex3. (2,0), (2,2) in Ex4.\nThese are exactly the pixels belonging to 4-way components of size 1 or 2.\nOkay, let's revisit: \"Find all 4-way connected components of green pixels. Change the color of all pixels belonging to any component with a size of 3 or more to azure.\"\nLet's re-run the check meticulously.\n*   **Ex 1:**\n    *   Comps (size): A(5), B(3), C(1).\n    *   Change A and B. Pixels = A U B = {(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)}.\n    *   Expected Azure = {(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)}.\n    *   Mismatch: Rule includes (2,0), expected does not.\n*   **Ex 2:**\n    *   Comps (size): A(4), B(1), C(1), D(1).\n    *   Change A. Pixels = A = {(0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)}.\n    *   Expected Azure = {(0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)}.\n    *   Match!\n*   **Ex 3:**\n    *   Comps (size): A(4), B(3), C(1), D(1), E(1).\n    *   Change A and B. Pixels = A U B = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2), (0,0), (0,1), (1,1)}.\n    *   Expected Azure = {(0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}. (Order differs but set is the same).\n    *   Match!\n*   **Ex 4:**\n    *   Comps (size): A(3), B(1), C(1).\n    *   Change A. Pixels = A = {(0,0), (0,1), (1,1)}.\n    *   Expected Azure = {(0,0), (0,1), (1,1)}.\n    *   Match!\n\nThe rule \"Find all 4-way connected components of green pixels. Change the color of all pixels belonging to any component with a size of 3 or more to azure\" works perfectly for Examples 2, 3, and 4, but fails *only* for Example 1, specifically by incorrectly changing pixel (2,0).\n\nIs Example 1 special? Or is the rule slightly different?\nWhat if the connectivity rule IS 8-way, but there's an exclusion?\nOriginal code: Find largest 8-way component, change its pixels.\n*   Ex 1: Largest 8-way is {(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0)}. Size 5. Code changes these. Expected changes {(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)} and {(2,3), (3,2), (3,3)}.\n*   Ex 2: Largest 8-way is {(0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,4)}. Size 5. Code changes these. Expected changes {(0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)}. Pixel (2,4) is incorrectly changed.\n*   Ex 3: Largest 8-way is {(0,0)...(4,2)}. Size 8. Code changes these. Expected changes {(0,0), (0,1), (1,1)} and {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}. Pixels (2,0) is incorrectly changed.\n*   Ex 4: Largest 8-way is {(0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2)}. Size 5. Code changes these. Expected changes {(0,0), (0,1), (1,1)}. Pixels (2,0) and (2,2) are incorrectly changed.\n\nThe 8-way rule seems further off than the 4-way size>=3 rule.\n\nLet's focus on Ex 1 and pixel (2,0). Why isn't it changed?\nInput:\n"

Size 3.\nPixel (2,0) is like a 'tail' attached to the 2x2 block {(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)}.\nCould the rule be: Find all 4-way components >= size 3. Change their color, UNLESS the component is composed of a 2x2 green block plus a single attached pixel 'tail'. In that specific case, only change the 2x2 block part?\n\nLet's test this specific exception:\n*   Ex 1: Component A = {(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0)}. Size 5. It IS a 2x2 block {(0,0)..(1,1)} plus a tail (2,0). Apply exception: only change the 2x2 block part -> {(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)}. Component B = {(2,3), (3,2), (3,3)}. Size 3. It is not a 2x2 block + tail. Change all of B -> {(2,3), (3,2), (3,3)}. Total changed = {(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)}. Matches Expected!\n*   Ex 2: Component A = {(0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)}. Size 4. Not a 2x2 block + tail. Change all of A. Matches Expected.\n*   Ex 3: Component A = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}. Size 4. Is a 2x2 block, no tail. Not the exception case. Change all of A. Component B = {(0,0), (0,1), (1,1)}. Size 3. Not a 2x2 block + tail. Change all of B. Matches Expected.\n*   Ex 4: Component A = {(0,0), (0,1), (1,1)}. Size 3. Not a 2x2 block + tail. Change all of A. Matches Expected.\n\nThis looks like a consistent rule covering all examples.\n\n**Final Hypothesis:**\n1. Find all connected components of green pixels using 4-way (von Neumann) adjacency.\n2. Identify all components with a size (number of pixels) of 3 or more.\n3. For each such component:\n    a. Check if it consists *exactly* of a 2x2 square of green pixels plus one additional green pixel connected (4-way) to exactly one pixel of the square (forming a \"tail\").\n    b. If condition (a) is met, mark only the 4 pixels forming the 2x2 square for color change.\n    c. If condition (a) is NOT met, mark all pixels in the component for color change.\n4. Change the color of all marked pixels from green (3) to azure (8).\n\nThis seems robust across the examples.## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempted to solve the task by identifying the single largest connected component of green pixels using 8-way connectivity and changing their color to azure. This approach failed on all provided training examples, indicating the underlying logic was incorrect. The failures show that:\n1.  Connectivity might not be 8-way.\n2.  The transformation might not apply only to the single largest component.\n3.  There might be specific conditions or exceptions based on the shape or structure of the green components.\n\nThe strategy will be to re-examine the examples, focusing on the differences between the expected and actual outputs, to deduce the correct connectivity rule, the criteria for selecting components/pixels to change, and any special cases. We will use 4-way connectivity and component size as primary investigation points, refining the hypothesis based on observed discrepancies.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nWe will analyze the components based on 4-way connectivity and check which components are modified in the expected output.\n\n"
