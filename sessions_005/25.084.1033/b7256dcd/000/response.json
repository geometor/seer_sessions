The size remains consistent between input and output for each example (5x5 for train_1, 6x4 for train_2).\n2.  **Color Palette:** The colors observed are orange (7), gray (6), green (3), yellow (4), and blue (1).\n3.  **Dominant Color:** Orange (7) appears frequently and seems to act as a static background; its positions are unchanged in the output.\n4.  **Target Color:** Gray (6) pixels are present in the input but some or all of them change color in the output. Gray seems to be the color that undergoes transformation.\n5.  **Source Colors:** Other colors (green, yellow, blue) are present in the input and retain their original positions in the output. They seem to influence the transformation of the gray pixels.\n6.  **Transformation Pattern:** The change in gray pixels appears related to their proximity to the \"source\" colors. In Example 1, gray pixels near green become green, and gray pixels near yellow become yellow. In Example 2, gray pixels near blue become blue, while gray pixels near green (but separated by orange) remain gray. This suggests a \"spreading\" or \"painting\" effect originating from the source colors onto adjacent gray pixels, propagating through contiguous gray areas. The orange background acts as a barrier to this spreading. Adjacency includes diagonals.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
