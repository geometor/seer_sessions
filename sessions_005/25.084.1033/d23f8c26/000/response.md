Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grids:** The task operates on 2D grids of pixels, where each pixel has a color represented by an integer (0-9). White (0) seems to be the background color.
2.  **Input/Output Relationship:** The output grid is the same size as the input grid. The output grid appears to be a filtered version of the input, where most of the input is erased (set to white), except for one specific column.
3.  **Columnar Operation:** The transformation seems to be focused on columns. One column from the input is preserved entirely in the output, retaining its original pixel values and vertical positions, while all other columns are replaced with white pixels.
4.  **Selection Criterion:** The core logic lies in identifying *which* column to preserve. Comparing the preserved columns across examples:
    *   Example 1: Column 2 is preserved.
    *   Example 2: Column 1 is preserved.
    *   Example 3: Column 2 is preserved.
5.  **Identifying the Preserved Column:** I examined properties of the columns (number of non-white pixels, sum of values, distinct colors) but found inconsistencies. A more promising property is the number of *vertically connected components* of non-white pixels within each column.
    *   Example 1: Components per column: [3, 1, 4, 2, 1]. Max is 4 (Column 2). Unique maximum.
    *   Example 2: Components per column: [2, 2, 1]. Max is 2 (Columns 0, 1). Tie.
    *   Example 3: Components per column: [1, 2, 2, 2, 2]. Max is 2 (Columns 1, 2, 3, 4). Tie.
6.  **Tie-breaking:** When multiple columns share the maximum number of components, a tie-breaking rule is needed.
    *   First tie-breaker: Consider the total number of non-white pixels in the tied columns. Select the column(s) with the maximum number of non-white pixels.
        *   Example 3: Non-white counts for tied columns [1, 2, 3, 4] are [2, 3, 2, 2]. Max is 3 (Column 2). Unique maximum after this tie-breaker.
    *   Second tie-breaker: If a tie persists after considering non-white pixel counts, select the column with the largest index (the rightmost one).
        *   Example 2: Non-white counts for tied columns [0, 1] are [2, 2]. Tie persists. Indices are 0 and 1. Max index is 1 (Column 1).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with white pixels (value 0).
2.  For each column in the input grid, calculate two values:
    a.  The number of vertically connected components of non-white pixels (where components are separated by white pixels).
    b.  The total count of non-white pixels.
3.  Determine the maximum number of vertical components found across all columns.
4.  Identify all columns that have this maximum number of vertical components. Call this set `candidate_columns_1`.
5.  If `candidate_columns_1` contains only one column, this is the `selected_column`. Proceed to step 8.
6.  If `candidate_columns_1` contains more than one column, determine the maximum non-white pixel count among the columns in `candidate_columns_1`. Identify all columns within `candidate_columns_1` that have this maximum non-white pixel count. Call this set `candidate_columns_2`.
7.  If `candidate_columns_2` contains only one column, this is the `selected_column`. If `candidate_columns_2` still contains more than one column, choose the one with the largest column index (rightmost) as the `selected_column`.
8.  Copy the pixel values from the `selected_column` in the input grid to the corresponding column index in the output grid.
9.  The resulting grid is the final output.
