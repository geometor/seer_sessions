task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  size_relation: output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid
  background_color: white (0)
transformation:
  type: column_selection_and_filtering
  steps:
    - name: analyze_columns
      description: Process each column of the input grid individually.
      properties:
        - property: vertical_components
          description: Count the number of vertically connected components of non-white pixels within the column. A component is one or more adjacent non-white pixels separated by white pixels (0) or grid boundaries.
        - property: non_white_count
          description: Count the total number of non-white pixels within the column.
    - name: select_column
      description: Identify the single column to preserve based on hierarchical criteria.
      criteria:
        - level: 1
          metric: vertical_components
          rule: Find the maximum count across all columns. Select column(s) with this maximum count.
        - level: 2 (tie-breaker)
          metric: non_white_count
          rule: If multiple columns tied at level 1, select the column(s) among them with the maximum non_white_count.
        - level: 3 (tie-breaker)
          metric: column_index
          rule: If multiple columns tied at level 2, select the column among them with the largest index (rightmost).
    - name: construct_output
      description: Create the output grid.
      details:
        - Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).
        - Copy the pixels from the selected input column into the corresponding column of the output grid.
