task_type: geometric_transformation
transformation: reflection
axis_of_reflection: vertical_midline # Equivalent to a horizontal flip
input_output_relation:
  - property: grid_dimensions
    relation: preserved # height and width remain the same
  - property: grid_pixels
    relation: mapped
    mapping_rule: The pixel value at input coordinate (row, column) is moved to the output coordinate (row, grid_width - 1 - column).
scope: entire_grid # The transformation applies globally to all pixels.
