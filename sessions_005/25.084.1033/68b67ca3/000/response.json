This suggests a downsampling or selection process where the output grid dimensions are half the input grid dimensions.\n    *   The input grids feature colored pixels sparsely distributed on a white (0) background.\n    *   A noticeable pattern in the input grids is that every second row and every second column (rows 1, 3, 5 and columns 1, 3, 5, using 0-based indexing) consist entirely of white pixels.\n    *   The colored pixels (objects) in the input grid appear only at intersections of even-numbered rows and even-numbered columns (0, 2, 4 for both row and column indices).\n    *   Comparing the input and output grids, the colored pixels from the input seem to be directly copied to the output grid, maintaining their relative positions but scaled down. White pixels at these selected locations in the input are also copied as white pixels in the output.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
