*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids are consistently 6x6, while the output grids are 3x3. This suggests a downsampling or selection process where the output grid dimensions are half the input grid dimensions.
    *   The input grids feature colored pixels sparsely distributed on a white (0) background.
    *   A noticeable pattern in the input grids is that every second row and every second column (rows 1, 3, 5 and columns 1, 3, 5, using 0-based indexing) consist entirely of white pixels.
    *   The colored pixels (objects) in the input grid appear only at intersections of even-numbered rows and even-numbered columns (0, 2, 4 for both row and column indices).
    *   Comparing the input and output grids, the colored pixels from the input seem to be directly copied to the output grid, maintaining their relative positions but scaled down. White pixels at these selected locations in the input are also copied as white pixels in the output.

        properties:
          - width: 6
          - height: 6
          - structure: Contains a background color (white, 0) and foreground objects (pixels with colors 1-9).
          - pattern: Rows and columns with odd indices (1, 3, 5) are entirely white. Foreground objects only appear at positions (row, col) where both 'row' and 'col' have even indices (0, 2, 4).

        properties:
          - width: 3
          - height: 3
          - content: Derived from the input grid by selecting specific pixels.

        description: Downsampling or selection based on coordinate parity.
        input_element: input_grid
        output_element: output_grid
        rule: A pixel at input coordinates (r_in, c_in) is selected if and only if both r_in and c_in are even numbers (0, 2, 4).
        mapping: The selected pixel from input coordinates (r_in, c_in) is placed at output coordinates (r_out, c_out), where r_out = r_in / 2 and c_out = c_in / 2.
    
    objects:
      - object: pixel
        properties:
          - color: Integer value 0-9.
          - position: Tuple (row, col).
          - role: Can be a background pixel (color 0) or part of a foreground object (color 1-9).
    
    actions:
      - action: select_pixels
        criteria: Select pixels from the input grid where both the row index and column index are even (0-based).
      - action: map_coordinates
        details: Map the selected input coordinates (r_in, c_in) to output coordinates (r_in / 2, c_in / 2).
      - action: create_output_grid
        details: Construct a new 3x3 grid using the selected pixels placed at their mapped coordinates.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the dimensions of the input grid (height `H_in`, width `W_in`) and the output grid (height `H_out`, width `W_out`). Observe that `H_out = H_in / 2` and `W_out = W_in / 2`.
    2.  Create a new grid for the output with dimensions `H_out` x `W_out`, initialized with the background color (white, 0).
    3.  Iterate through the pixels of the input grid using their coordinates (row `r_in`, column `c_in`), starting from index 0.
    4.  For each pixel in the input grid, check if both its row index `r_in` and its column index `c_in` are even numbers (`r_in % 2 == 0` and `c_in % 2 == 0`).
    5.  If both indices are even, calculate the corresponding output coordinates: `r_out = r_in / 2` and `c_out = c_in / 2`.
    6.  Copy the color value of the input pixel at (`r_in`, `c_in`) to the output grid pixel at (`r_out`, `c_out`).
    7.  After checking all pixels in the input grid, the populated output grid is the result.
