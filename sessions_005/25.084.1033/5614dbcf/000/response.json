Gray pixels themselves do not seem to directly determine the output color but can exist within or alongside the determining colored object.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Iterate through the 9x9 input grid using a 3x3 window (subgrid) with a step of 3 in both row and column directions. This defines nine 3x3 subgrids.

Create a frequency count (histogram) of the colors present within that subgrid.\n    b.  Remove entries for white (0) and gray (5) from the frequency count.\n    c.  Check if any significant colors (1-4, 6-9) remain in the frequency count.\n    d.  If significant colors remain:\n        i.  Find the color with the maximum frequency count.\n        ii. If there is a unique color with the maximum frequency, set the corresponding cell in the output grid at position `(r/3, c/3)` to this color.\n        iii.

If no significant colors remain after step 3b (meaning the subgrid only contained white and/or gray), set the corresponding output cell at `(r/3, c/3)` to white (0).\n4.
