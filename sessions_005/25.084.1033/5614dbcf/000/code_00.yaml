facts:
  - grid_transformation:
      input_size: 9x9
      output_size: 3x3
      process: summarization
      granularity: maps 3x3 input subgrids to 1x1 output cells

  - subgrid_mapping:
      input_division: non-overlapping 3x3 subgrids
      correspondence: input subgrid at (row_start, col_start) maps to output cell at (row_start/3, col_start/3)

  - color_roles:
      - color: 0 (white)
        role: background, ignored in summarization rule unless it's the only color present (with gray).
      - color: 5 (gray)
        role: insignificant, ignored when determining the output color. Does not contribute to the output color itself.
      - colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]
        role: significant, candidates for determining the output color based on frequency within a subgrid.

  - summarization_rule:
      for_each: 3x3 input subgrid
      condition:
        - count frequencies of all significant colors (1-4, 6-9).
        - if one or more significant colors are present:
            find the color with the highest frequency.
            set the corresponding output cell to this most frequent significant color.
            (Assumption: Ties are not explicitly handled by examples, but imply outputting white if no single dominant significant color exists).
        - else (subgrid contains only white and/or gray):
            set the corresponding output cell to white (0).
