*   **Perception:**
    *   The task involves transforming a larger input grid (9x9) into a smaller output grid (3x3).
    *   This suggests a downscaling or summarization process where each 3x3 region of the input grid corresponds to a single cell in the output grid.
    *   The input grids contain various colored objects (contiguous blocks of non-white pixels) and scattered gray pixels.
    *   The color of an output cell seems determined by the content of the corresponding 3x3 input subgrid.
    *   Specifically, the dominant color (most frequent pixel count) within the 3x3 subgrid, excluding white (color 0) and gray (color 5), determines the output cell's color.
    *   If a 3x3 subgrid contains only white and/or gray pixels, the corresponding output cell is white. Gray pixels themselves do not seem to directly determine the output color but can exist within or alongside the determining colored object.

*   **YAML Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - grid_transformation:
      input_size: 9x9
      output_size: 3x3
      process: summarization
      granularity: maps 3x3 input subgrids to 1x1 output cells

  - subgrid_mapping:
      input_division: non-overlapping 3x3 subgrids
      correspondence: input subgrid at (row_start, col_start) maps to output cell at (row_start/3, col_start/3)

  - color_roles:
      - color: 0 (white)
        role: background, ignored in summarization rule unless it's the only color present (with gray).
      - color: 5 (gray)
        role: insignificant, ignored when determining the output color. Does not contribute to the output color itself.
      - colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]
        role: significant, candidates for determining the output color based on frequency within a subgrid.

  - summarization_rule:
      for_each: 3x3 input subgrid
      condition:
        - count frequencies of all significant colors (1-4, 6-9).
        - if one or more significant colors are present:
            find the color with the highest frequency.
            set the corresponding output cell to this most frequent significant color.
            (Assumption: Ties are not explicitly handled by examples, but imply outputting white if no single dominant significant color exists).
        - else (subgrid contains only white and/or gray):
            set the corresponding output cell to white (0).
```


*   **Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty 3x3 output grid with white (0) pixels.
2.  Iterate through the 9x9 input grid using a 3x3 window (subgrid) with a step of 3 in both row and column directions. This defines nine 3x3 subgrids. Let the top-left corner of the current subgrid be `(r, c)`, where `r` and `c` are multiples of 3 (0, 3, 6).
3.  For each 3x3 subgrid:
    a.  Create a frequency count (histogram) of the colors present within that subgrid.
    b.  Remove entries for white (0) and gray (5) from the frequency count.
    c.  Check if any significant colors (1-4, 6-9) remain in the frequency count.
    d.  If significant colors remain:
        i.  Find the color with the maximum frequency count.
        ii. If there is a unique color with the maximum frequency, set the corresponding cell in the output grid at position `(r/3, c/3)` to this color.
        iii. If there is a tie for the maximum frequency among significant colors, or if no significant colors were found (step 3c was false), set the corresponding output cell at `(r/3, c/3)` to white (0).
    e.  If no significant colors remain after step 3b (meaning the subgrid only contained white and/or gray), set the corresponding output cell at `(r/3, c/3)` to white (0).
4.  Return the populated 3x3 output grid.
