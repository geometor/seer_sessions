The transformation involves changing the colors (values) of specific pixels within the grid. Observing the changes across the examples, it appears that only two colors are consistently affected: gray (value 5) and azure (value 8). In every location where the input grid has a gray pixel, the output grid has an azure pixel, and conversely, where the input grid has an azure pixel, the output grid has a gray pixel. All other colors remain in their original positions. This suggests a simple substitution or swap between these two specific colors.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
