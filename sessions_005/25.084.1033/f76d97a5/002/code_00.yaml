task_type: pixel_wise_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  size_constancy: True # Output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
color_properties:
  input_palette: Contains exactly two colors: gray (5) and one other color (Color X).
  output_palette: Contains exactly two colors: white (0) and the Color X from the input.
  color_x_values: [6 (magenta), 4 (yellow), 9 (maroon)] # Observed in examples
transformation_rule:
  type: conditional_replacement
  steps:
    - identify: Determine Color X (the non-gray color) present in the input grid.
    - replace_gray: Change all pixels with the value gray (5) to the value of Color X.
    - replace_color_x: Change all pixels with the original value of Color X to the value white (0).
  locality: Pixel-wise (each pixel's output value depends only on its input value and the global Color X).
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties: color_value
    actions:
      - conditionally_change_color based on initial value and the grid's Color X.
