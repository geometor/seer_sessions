*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids contain two distinct colors. One color is always gray (5). The other color varies between examples (magenta (6), yellow (4), maroon (9)).
    *   The output grids also contain two colors. One color is always white (0). The other color is the non-gray color from the corresponding input grid.
    *   The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical for each example.
    *   The positions of the non-gray pixels remain unchanged from input to output.
    *   The positions of the gray (5) pixels in the input correspond to the positions of the white (0) pixels in the output.
    *   The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the two colors in the input, keeping the non-gray color, and replacing the gray color (5) with white (0).

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Replace one specific color with white while keeping the other color.
    
    elements:
      - element: grid
        properties:
          - dimensions: preserved between input and output.
          - pixel_colors: input contains two colors, output contains two colors.
      - element: primary_color
        properties:
          - description: The non-gray color present in the input grid.
          - relationship_to_output: This color and its positions are preserved in the output grid.
          - values_observed: [magenta (6), yellow (4), maroon (9)]
      - element: secondary_color
        properties:
          - description: The gray color (5) present in the input grid.
          - relationship_to_output: All pixels of this color in the input are replaced by white (0) in the output.
          - value_observed: gray (5)
      - element: replacement_color
        properties:
          - description: The color used to replace the secondary_color in the output.
          - value_observed: white (0)
    
    transformation:
      - action: identify_colors
        inputs: [input_grid]
        outputs: [primary_color, secondary_color (which is gray 5)]
      - action: replace_color
        inputs: [input_grid, secondary_color (gray 5), replacement_color (white 0)]
        description: Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. If the pixel color matches the secondary_color (gray 5), change it to the replacement_color (white 0). Otherwise, keep the original pixel color (which will be the primary_color).
        outputs: [output_grid]
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
    3.  If the color of the input pixel is gray (5), set the corresponding pixel in the new grid to white (0).
    4.  If the color of the input pixel is not gray (5), keep its original color in the corresponding pixel of the new grid.
    5.  The resulting new grid is the output.
