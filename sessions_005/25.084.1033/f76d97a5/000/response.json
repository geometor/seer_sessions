The other color varies between examples (magenta (6), yellow (4), maroon (9)).\n    *   The output grids also contain two colors. One color is always white (0). The other color is the non-gray color from the corresponding input grid.\n    *   The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical for each example.\n    *   The positions of the non-gray pixels remain unchanged from input to output.\n    *   The positions of the gray (5) pixels in the input correspond to the positions of the white (0) pixels in the output.\n    *   The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the two colors in the input, keeping the non-gray color, and replacing the gray color (5) with white (0).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
