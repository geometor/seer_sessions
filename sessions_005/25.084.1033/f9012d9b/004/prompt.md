"""
1. Identify the contiguous block of white pixels (color 0). Determine its top-left corner coordinates (row `wr`, column `wc`) and its dimensions (height `wh`, width `ww`). The output grid will have the same dimensions (`wh`, `ww`).
2. Find all red pixels (color 2) that are located in the same rows as the white block (i.e., in rows from `wr` to `wr + wh - 1`). Call these "relevant red pixels".
3. Check if any relevant red pixels were found.
4. Case 1: No relevant red pixels exist.
    - The top row `otr` of the output subgrid in the input is `wr + 2`.
    - The left column `otc` of the output subgrid in the input is `wc`.
5. Case 2: One or more relevant red pixels exist.
    - The top row `otr` of the output subgrid in the input is `wr`.
    - Find the relevant red pixel with the minimum column index (`rc_min`).
    - Compare this minimum column index `rc_min` to the white block's starting column `wc`:
        - If `rc_min` is less than `wc` (the leftmost relevant red pixel is to the left of the white block), then the left column `otc` of the output subgrid is `wc - 2`.
        - If `rc_min` is greater than or equal to `wc` (the leftmost relevant red pixel is in the same column or to the right of the white block), then the left column `otc` of the output subgrid is `wc + 2`.
6. Extract the subgrid of size `wh` x `ww` from the input grid, starting at the calculated coordinates (`otr`, `otc`). This subgrid is the final output.
