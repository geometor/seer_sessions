The output grid is a copy of this target subgrid.\n    *   White pixels (0) form a rectangular block (possibly 1x1) which acts as a primary reference point and determines the size of the output grid.\n    *   A single red pixel (2), if present, acts as a secondary marker, modifying the location calculation for the target subgrid relative to the white block.\n    *   The location of the target subgrid is calculated based on the position of the white block and, if present, the position of the red pixel. The rules for calculating the target location depend on whether the red pixel exists and its column position relative to the white block.\n    *   The output grid has the same dimensions as the white block.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
