facts:
  - object: white_block
    description: A contiguous block of white (0) pixels. Can be any rectangular size.
    properties:
      - top_left_coord: (wr, wc)
      - size: (wh, ww)
  - object: red_pixel
    description: Pixels with value red (2). Can be multiple.
  - object: relevant_red_pixels
    description: A subset of red pixels that share at least one row with the white_block.
    condition: A red pixel (r, c) is relevant if wr <= r < wr + wh.
    properties:
      - exists: boolean flag indicating if any relevant red pixels were found.
      - min_column_pixel: The relevant red pixel (rr_min, rc_min) that has the smallest column index rc_min among all relevant red pixels. Only defined if relevant red pixels exist.
  - object: output_grid
    description: A subgrid extracted from the input grid.
    properties:
      - size: Always matches the size (wh, ww) of the white_block.
      - top_left_coord: (otr, otc), determined by the white_block and relevant_red_pixels.
  - action: determine_output_origin
    description: Calculates the top-left coordinate (otr, otc) for the output_grid.
    logic:
      - IF no relevant_red_pixels exist:
          otr = wr + 2
          otc = wc
      - ELSE (relevant_red_pixels exist):
          otr = wr
          Find min_column_pixel (rr_min, rc_min).
          IF rc_min < wc:
            otc = wc - 2
          ELSE (rc_min >= wc):
            otc = wc + 2
  - action: extract_subgrid
    description: Copies the portion of the input grid corresponding to the calculated output origin and size.
    input: input_grid, (otr, otc), (wh, ww)
    output: output_grid
