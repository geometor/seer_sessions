Determine its top-left corner coordinates (`wr`, `wc`) and its dimensions (height `wh`, width `ww`). The output grid will have these dimensions (`wh`, `ww`).\n2. Find all red pixels (color 2) located in the same rows as the white block (rows `wr` to `wr + wh - 1`). Call these \"relevant red pixels\".\n3. Determine the starting coordinates (`otr`, `otc`) for extracting the output subgrid based on the presence and location of relevant red pixels:\n    a.  **If no relevant red pixels exist:**\n        *   Set the starting row `otr = wr + 2`.\n        *   Set the starting column `otc = wc`.\n    b.  **If relevant red pixels exist:**\n        *   Set the starting row `otr = wr`.\n        *   Find the minimum column index (`min_rc`) among all relevant red pixels.\n        *   **If `min_rc` is greater than or equal to `wc`** (the leftmost relevant red pixel is at or to the right of the white block's left edge):\n            *   Set the starting column `otc = wc + 2`.\n        *   **If `min_rc` is less than `wc`** (the leftmost relevant red pixel is to the left of the white block's left edge):\n            *   Consider only the relevant red pixels whose column index `c` is less than `wc`.\n            *   Calculate the horizontal distance from the white block's left edge (`wc`) to each of these pixels (`wc - c`).\n            *   Find the minimum of these distances (`min_dist`).\n            *   Set the starting column `otc = wc - (min_dist + 2)`.\n4. Extract the subgrid of size `wh` x `ww` from the input grid, starting at the calculated coordinates (`otr`, `otc`). This subgrid is the final output.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Optional\n\ndef find_pixels(grid: np.ndarray, color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"Finds all coordinates (row, col) of pixels with a specific color.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = np.where(grid == color)\n    return list(zip(rows.tolist(), cols.tolist())) # Ensure standard int types\n\ndef find_bounding_box(coords: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the top-left corner (min_row, min_col) and dimensions (height, width)\n    of a bounding box containing all given coordinates.\n    Assumes coordinates represent a contiguous block for the white block case.\n    Returns None if coords is empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not coords:\n        return None\n    min_row = min(r for r, c in coords)\n    min_col = min(c for r, c in coords)\n    max_row = max(r for r, c in coords)\n    max_col = max(c for r, c in coords)\n    height = max_row - min_row + 1\n    width = max_col - min_col + 1\n    return min_row, min_col, height, width\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    input_h, input_w = input_np.shape\n\n    # 1.
