"""
This function transforms an input grid based on the positions of a white block (color 0) and an optional red pixel (color 2).

1. Find the bounding box (top-left corner and dimensions) of the contiguous white block (color 0).
2. Find the location of the single red pixel (color 2), if it exists.
3. The output grid dimensions are determined by the dimensions of the white block.
4. Calculate the top-left corner (otr, otc) of the target subgrid in the input grid based on the following rules:
    - If no red pixel exists: otr = wr + 2, otc = wc (where wr, wc are the top-left of the white block).
    - If a red pixel exists at (rr, rc):
        - otr = wr
        - If rc < wc: otc = wc + 2 * (rc - wc)
        - If rc >= wc: otc = rc
5. Extract the subgrid from the input grid starting at (otr, otc) with the dimensions of the white block.
6. Return the extracted subgrid.
