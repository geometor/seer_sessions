Determine its top-left corner coordinates (row `wr`, column `wc`) and its dimensions (height `wh`, width `ww`). The output grid will have the same dimensions (`wh`, `ww`).\n2. Find all red pixels (color 2) that are located in the same rows as the white block (i.e., in rows from `wr` to `wr + wh - 1`). Call these \"relevant red pixels\".\n3. Check if any relevant red pixels were found.\n4. Case 1: No relevant red pixels exist.\n    - The top row `otr` of the output subgrid in the input is `wr + 2`.\n    - The left column `otc` of the output subgrid in the input is `wc`.\n5. Case 2: One or more relevant red pixels exist.\n    - The top row `otr` of the output subgrid in the input is `wr`.\n    - Find the relevant red pixel with the minimum column index (`min_rc`).\n    - Compare this minimum column index `min_rc` to the white block's starting column `wc`:\n        - If `min_rc` is less than `wc` (the leftmost relevant red pixel is to the left of the white block), then the left column `otc` of the output subgrid is `wc - 1`.\n        - If `min_rc` is greater than or equal to `wc` (the leftmost relevant red pixel is in the same column or to the right of the white block), then the left column `otc` of the output subgrid is `wc + 2`.\n6. Extract the subgrid of size `wh` x `ww` from the input grid, starting at the calculated coordinates (`otr`, `otc`). This subgrid is the final output.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Optional\n\ndef find_pixels(grid: np.ndarray, color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"Finds all coordinates (row, col) of pixels with a specific color.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = np.where(grid == color)\n    return list(zip(rows, cols))\n\ndef find_bounding_box(coords: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the top-left corner (min_row, min_col) and dimensions (height, width)\n    of a bounding box containing all given coordinates.\n    Assumes coordinates represent a contiguous block for the white block case.\n    Returns None if coords is empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not coords:\n        return None\n    min_row = min(r for r, c in coords)\n    min_col = min(c for r, c in coords)\n    max_row = max(r for r, c in coords)\n    max_col = max(c for r, c in coords)\n    height = max_row - min_row + 1\n    width = max_col - min_col + 1\n    return min_row, min_col, height, width\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    input_h, input_w = input_np.shape\n\n    # 1.
