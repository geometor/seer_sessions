Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Color Palette:** The grids primarily use 'white' (0) and 'red' (2). The output introduces 'blue' (1).
2.  **Input/Output Comparison:** In each example pair, the output grid is almost identical to the input grid. The only difference is that one or more 'red' (2) pixels in the input have been changed to 'blue' (1) in the output. 'White' (0) pixels never change.
3.  **Pattern Identification:** The key seems to be identifying *which* 'red' pixels change. Observing the examples:
    *   In `train_1`, the 'red' pixel at (row 2, col 3) changes. Its orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right) are all 'white'.
    *   In `train_2`, 'red' pixels at (2, 3) and (3, 1) change. Both have only 'white' orthogonal neighbors.
    *   In `train_3`, 'red' pixels at (1, 2) and (2, 1) change. Both have only 'white' orthogonal neighbors.
    *   In `train_4`, the 'red' pixel at (2, 0) changes. It has only 'white' orthogonal neighbors (considering grid boundaries).
4.  **Hypothesis:** A 'red' pixel changes to 'blue' if and only if all of its immediately adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right) are 'white'. If a 'red' pixel has even one 'red' orthogonal neighbor, it remains unchanged.

**Facts:**

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
3.  For each pixel, check if its color is 'red' (2).
4.  If the pixel is 'red', examine its orthogonal neighbors (the pixels directly above, below, left, and right of it, staying within the grid boundaries).
5.  Count how many of these orthogonal neighbors are also 'red' (2).
6.  If the count of 'red' orthogonal neighbors is zero (meaning all orthogonal neighbors are 'white' or off the grid), change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid copy to 'blue' (1).
7.  If the pixel is not 'red', or if it is 'red' but has one or more 'red' orthogonal neighbors, keep its color the same in the output grid copy.
8.  After checking all pixels, the modified grid copy is the final output.
