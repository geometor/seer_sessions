task_description: Modify specific pixels based on their color and neighborhood context.
elements:
  - type: pixel
    attributes:
      color: 'white' (0), 'red' (2), 'blue' (1)
      location: grid coordinates (row, col)
      state: can change color based on rules
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels.
  - type: red_pixel_group
    description: One or more orthogonally connected 'red' pixels.
  - type: isolated_red_pixel
    description: A 'red' pixel whose orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right) are all 'white'.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels can be adjacent orthogonally (sharing an edge).
actions:
  - name: change_color
    input_object: isolated_red_pixel
    output_state: Pixel color becomes 'blue' (1).
    condition: The pixel must be 'red' (2) and all its orthogonal neighbors must be 'white' (0).
unchanged_elements:
  - 'white' pixels
  - 'red' pixels that have at least one 'red' orthogonal neighbor.
