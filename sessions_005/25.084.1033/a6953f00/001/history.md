**Perception:**

The task involves extracting a specific 2x2 section from the input grid. The input grids vary in size (4x4, 3x3, 5x5), while the output grid is consistently 2x2. By comparing the input and output grids in each example, I observed that the output is always a contiguous 2x2 block of pixels taken directly from the input grid. The position of this 2x2 block within the input grid appears to depend on the dimensions of the input grid. Specifically, in examples with odd width (3x3 and 5x5), the top-left 2x2 block is extracted. In the example with an even width (4x4), the top-right 2x2 block is extracted.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: extraction
input_properties:
  - type: grid
  - variable_dimensions: true
output_properties:
  - type: grid
  - fixed_dimensions:
      width: 2
      height: 2
transformation:
  - action: extract_subgrid
  - subgrid_size: 2x2
  - location_determination:
      - condition: input_grid_width is odd
        location: top-left corner (rows 0-1, columns 0-1)
      - condition: input_grid_width is even
        location: top-right corner (rows 0-1, columns width-2 to width-1)
relationships:
  - The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid.
  - The position of the extracted subgrid depends on the parity (odd/even) of the input grid's width.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the width of the input grid.
2.  Check if the width is odd or even.
3.  If the width is odd, extract the 2x2 subgrid located at the top-left corner (rows 0 and 1, columns 0 and 1) of the input grid.
4.  If the width is even, extract the 2x2 subgrid located at the top-right corner (rows 0 and 1, columns `width-2` and `width-1`) of the input grid.
5.  The extracted 2x2 subgrid is the output grid.
