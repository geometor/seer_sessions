The input grids vary in size (4x4, 3x3, 5x5), while the output grid is consistently 2x2. By comparing the input and output grids in each example, I observed that the output is always a contiguous 2x2 block of pixels taken directly from the input grid. The position of this 2x2 block within the input grid appears to depend on the dimensions of the input grid. Specifically, in examples with odd width (3x3 and 5x5), the top-left 2x2 block is extracted. In the example with an even width (4x4), the top-right 2x2 block is extracted.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
