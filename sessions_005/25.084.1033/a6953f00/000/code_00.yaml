task_type: extraction
input_properties:
  - type: grid
  - variable_dimensions: true
output_properties:
  - type: grid
  - fixed_dimensions:
      width: 2
      height: 2
transformation:
  - action: extract_subgrid
  - subgrid_size: 2x2
  - location_determination:
      - condition: input_grid_width is odd
        location: top-left corner (rows 0-1, columns 0-1)
      - condition: input_grid_width is even
        location: top-right corner (rows 0-1, columns width-2 to width-1)
relationships:
  - The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid.
  - The position of the extracted subgrid depends on the parity (odd/even) of the input grid's width.
