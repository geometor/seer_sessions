The separator line seems irrelevant to the final output grid's content, only serving to divide the input regions.\n    *   For each position (row `r`, column `c`) within the 4x4 dimensions:\n        *   Consider the pixel value `G1[r, c]` from the top grid.\n        *   Consider the pixel value `G2[r, c]` from the bottom grid (offset by 5 rows in the input).\n        *   The output pixel `Out[r, c]` seems to depend on whether `G1[r, c]` and `G2[r, c]` are non-white (i.e., not 0).\n    *   Observing the examples, an output pixel `Out[r, c]` is green (3) if *exactly one* of the corresponding input pixels (`G1[r, c]` or `G2[r, c]`) is non-white (blue or red, respectively).\n    *   If *both* `G1[r, c]` and `G2[r, c]` are white (0), the output `Out[r, c]` is white (0).\n    *   If *both* `G1[r, c]` is non-white (blue=1) and `G2[r, c]` is non-white (red=2), the output `Out[r, c]` is white (0).\n    *   This behavior matches the logical XOR operation applied to the \"non-whiteness\" of the corresponding pixels.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Create a new 4x4 output grid, initially filled with white (0).\n3.  Iterate through each cell position (row `r`, column `c`) from (0, 0) to (3, 3).\n4.  At each position (r, c), examine the color of the cell in G1 (let's call it `color1`) and the color of the corresponding cell in G2 (let's call it `color2`).\n5.  Check if `color1` is non-white (value is not 0).\n6.  Check if `color2` is non-white (value is not 0).\n7.  If exactly one of these conditions is true (i.e., one cell is non-white and the other is white), set the corresponding cell (r, c) in the output grid to green (3).\n8.  If both conditions are false (both cells are white) or both conditions are true (both cells are non-white), leave the corresponding cell (r, c) in the output grid as white (0).\n9.
