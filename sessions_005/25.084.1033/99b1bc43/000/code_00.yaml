InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Height: 9
    - Width: 4
  Objects:
    - Name: TopGrid (G1)
      Location: Rows 0-3, Columns 0-3
      Dimensions: 4x4
      PixelColors: [Blue (1), White (0)]
    - Name: Separator
      Location: Row 4, Columns 0-3
      Dimensions: 1x4
      PixelColors: [Yellow (4)]
      Role: Divides TopGrid and BottomGrid
    - Name: BottomGrid (G2)
      Location: Rows 5-8, Columns 0-3
      Dimensions: 4x4
      PixelColors: [Red (2), White (0)]

OutputGrid:

TransformationRule:
  Type: Cellwise Comparison (XOR)
  InputMapping:
    - Source: TopGrid (G1)
      Coordinates: (r, c) where 0 <= r < 4, 0 <= c < 4
    - Source: BottomGrid (G2)
      Coordinates: (r, c) where 0 <= r < 4, 0 <= c < 4
  OutputMapping:
    - Target: OutputGrid
      Coordinates: (r, c) where 0 <= r < 4, 0 <= c < 4
  Logic: For each coordinate (r, c):
    - Let p1 be the pixel value in G1 at (r, c).
    - Let p2 be the pixel value in G2 at (r, c).
    - The output pixel value at (r, c) is Green (3) if (p1 is not White (0) AND p2 is White (0)) OR (p1 is White (0) AND p2 is not White (0)).
    - Otherwise, the output pixel value at (r, c) is White (0).
  Equivalently: Output[r, c] = 3 if (G1[r, c] != 0) XOR (G2[r, c] != 0), else Output[r, c] = 0.
