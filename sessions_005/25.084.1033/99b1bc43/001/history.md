Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid has a consistent structure:
    *   A 4x4 grid at the top (rows 0-3).
    *   A single row of yellow pixels (color 4) acting as a separator (row 4).
    *   A 4x4 grid at the bottom (rows 5-8).
    *   The total input grid dimensions are 9x4.

2.  **Input Colors:**
    *   The top 4x4 grid uses only blue (1) and white (0).
    *   The separator row uses only yellow (4).
    *   The bottom 4x4 grid uses only red (2) and white (0).

3.  **Output Structure:** Each output grid is a 4x4 grid.

4.  **Output Colors:** The output grid uses only green (3) and white (0).

5.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to be a cell-by-cell comparison between the top 4x4 input grid (let's call it G1) and the bottom 4x4 input grid (G2). The separator line seems irrelevant to the final output grid's content, only serving to divide the input regions.
    *   For each position (row `r`, column `c`) within the 4x4 dimensions:
        *   Consider the pixel value `G1[r, c]` from the top grid.
        *   Consider the pixel value `G2[r, c]` from the bottom grid (offset by 5 rows in the input).
        *   The output pixel `Out[r, c]` seems to depend on whether `G1[r, c]` and `G2[r, c]` are non-white (i.e., not 0).
    *   Observing the examples, an output pixel `Out[r, c]` is green (3) if *exactly one* of the corresponding input pixels (`G1[r, c]` or `G2[r, c]`) is non-white (blue or red, respectively).
    *   If *both* `G1[r, c]` and `G2[r, c]` are white (0), the output `Out[r, c]` is white (0).
    *   If *both* `G1[r, c]` is non-white (blue=1) and `G2[r, c]` is non-white (red=2), the output `Out[r, c]` is white (0).
    *   This behavior matches the logical XOR operation applied to the "non-whiteness" of the corresponding pixels.

## Facts


```yaml
InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Height: 9
    - Width: 4
  Objects:
    - Name: TopGrid (G1)
      Location: Rows 0-3, Columns 0-3
      Dimensions: 4x4
      PixelColors: [Blue (1), White (0)]
    - Name: Separator
      Location: Row 4, Columns 0-3
      Dimensions: 1x4
      PixelColors: [Yellow (4)]
      Role: Divides TopGrid and BottomGrid
    - Name: BottomGrid (G2)
      Location: Rows 5-8, Columns 0-3
      Dimensions: 4x4
      PixelColors: [Red (2), White (0)]

OutputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Height: 4
    - Width: 4
  PixelColors: [Green (3), White (0)]

TransformationRule:
  Type: Cellwise Comparison (XOR)
  InputMapping:
    - Source: TopGrid (G1)
      Coordinates: (r, c) where 0 <= r < 4, 0 <= c < 4
    - Source: BottomGrid (G2)
      Coordinates: (r, c) where 0 <= r < 4, 0 <= c < 4
  OutputMapping:
    - Target: OutputGrid
      Coordinates: (r, c) where 0 <= r < 4, 0 <= c < 4
  Logic: For each coordinate (r, c):
    - Let p1 be the pixel value in G1 at (r, c).
    - Let p2 be the pixel value in G2 at (r, c).
    - The output pixel value at (r, c) is Green (3) if (p1 is not White (0) AND p2 is White (0)) OR (p1 is White (0) AND p2 is not White (0)).
    - Otherwise, the output pixel value at (r, c) is White (0).
  Equivalently: Output[r, c] = 3 if (G1[r, c] != 0) XOR (G2[r, c] != 0), else Output[r, c] = 0.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the top 4x4 grid (G1, rows 0-3) and the bottom 4x4 grid (G2, rows 5-8) in the input grid, ignoring the separator row (row 4).
2.  Create a new 4x4 output grid, initially filled with white (0).
3.  Iterate through each cell position (row `r`, column `c`) from (0, 0) to (3, 3).
4.  At each position (r, c), examine the color of the cell in G1 (let's call it `color1`) and the color of the corresponding cell in G2 (let's call it `color2`).
5.  Check if `color1` is non-white (value is not 0).
6.  Check if `color2` is non-white (value is not 0).
7.  If exactly one of these conditions is true (i.e., one cell is non-white and the other is white), set the corresponding cell (r, c) in the output grid to green (3).
8.  If both conditions are false (both cells are white) or both conditions are true (both cells are non-white), leave the corresponding cell (r, c) in the output grid as white (0).
9.  Return the completed 4x4 output grid.
