task_description: Perform a pixel-wise combination of two subgrids separated by a specific marker line.
grid_elements:
  - type: separator
    color: yellow (4)
    shape: horizontal line
    function: Divides the input grid into two main parts.
  - type: subgrid
    name: Grid A
    location: Above the separator line.
    pixels:
      - blue (1)
      - white (0)
    role: Input 1 for the combination operation.
  - type: subgrid
    name: Grid B
    location: Below the separator line.
    pixels:
      - red (2)
      - white (0)
    role: Input 2 for the combination operation.
  - type: subgrid
    name: Output Grid
    pixels:
      - green (3)
      - white (0)
    role: Result of the combination operation.
    properties:
      - Has the same dimensions as Grid A and Grid B.
relationships:
  - Grid A and Grid B always have identical dimensions within the same example.
  - The Output Grid always has the same dimensions as Grid A and Grid B.
  - The yellow separator line is always present and separates Grid A from Grid B.
transformation:
  type: pixel-wise combination (logical OR equivalent)
  rule: For each coordinate (row, col):
    - condition: If Grid_A[row, col] is blue (1) OR Grid_B[row, col] is red (2)
      result: Output_Grid[row, col] becomes green (3)
    - condition: If Grid_A[row, col] is white (0) AND Grid_B[row, col] is white (0)
      result: Output_Grid[row, col] becomes white (0)
