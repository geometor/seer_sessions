            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid consists of three distinct sections stacked vertically.\n    *   The top section uses blue (1) and white (0) pixels.\n    *   The middle section is a single horizontal line composed entirely of yellow (4) pixels. This line acts as a separator.\n    *   The bottom section uses red (2) and white (0) pixels.\n2.  **Grid Dimensions:** The top section (let's call it `Grid A`) and the bottom section (`Grid B`) always have the same dimensions (height and width) within a single example. The yellow separator line has the same width as `Grid A` and `Grid B`.\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output grid has the same dimensions as `Grid A` and `Grid B`. It uses green (3) and white (0) pixels.\n4.  **Color Mapping:** The primary colors involved are blue (1) in the top input part, red (2) in the bottom input part, yellow (4) as a separator, green (3) in the output, and white (0) as the background/neutral color in all grids.\n5.  **Pixel-wise Relationship:** Comparing the input grids (`A` and `B`) with the output grid suggests a pixel-by-pixel transformation. The color of a pixel at position (row, col) in the output depends on the colors of the pixels at the same position (row, col) in `Grid A` and `Grid B`.\n6.  **Transformation Logic:**\n    *   If a pixel at (row, col) in `Grid A` is blue (1) OR the pixel at (row, col) in `Grid B` is red (2), then the corresponding pixel at (row, col) in the output grid is green (3).\n    *   If the pixel at (row, col) in `Grid A` is white (0) AND the pixel at (row, col) in `Grid B` is also white (0), then the corresponding pixel at (row, col) in the output grid is white (0).\n    *   This behaves like a logical OR operation applied pixel-wise across the two input subgrids, where blue and red represent 'true' and white represents 'false', resulting in green for 'true' and white for 'false'.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
