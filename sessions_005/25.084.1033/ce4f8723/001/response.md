"""
Combines two subgrids from the input grid based on a pixel-wise logical OR operation.
The input grid contains two subgrids (Grid A with blue (1) and white (0), Grid B with red (2) and white (0))
separated by a horizontal line of yellow (4) pixels.
The output grid has the same dimensions as the subgrids.
A pixel in the output grid is green (3) if the corresponding pixel in Grid A is blue (1) OR
the corresponding pixel in Grid B is red (2). Otherwise, the output pixel is white (0).
