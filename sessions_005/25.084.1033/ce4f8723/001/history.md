Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid consists of three distinct sections stacked vertically.
    *   The top section uses blue (1) and white (0) pixels.
    *   The middle section is a single horizontal line composed entirely of yellow (4) pixels. This line acts as a separator.
    *   The bottom section uses red (2) and white (0) pixels.
2.  **Grid Dimensions:** The top section (let's call it `Grid A`) and the bottom section (`Grid B`) always have the same dimensions (height and width) within a single example. The yellow separator line has the same width as `Grid A` and `Grid B`.
3.  **Output Structure:** The output grid has the same dimensions as `Grid A` and `Grid B`. It uses green (3) and white (0) pixels.
4.  **Color Mapping:** The primary colors involved are blue (1) in the top input part, red (2) in the bottom input part, yellow (4) as a separator, green (3) in the output, and white (0) as the background/neutral color in all grids.
5.  **Pixel-wise Relationship:** Comparing the input grids (`A` and `B`) with the output grid suggests a pixel-by-pixel transformation. The color of a pixel at position (row, col) in the output depends on the colors of the pixels at the same position (row, col) in `Grid A` and `Grid B`.
6.  **Transformation Logic:**
    *   If a pixel at (row, col) in `Grid A` is blue (1) OR the pixel at (row, col) in `Grid B` is red (2), then the corresponding pixel at (row, col) in the output grid is green (3).
    *   If the pixel at (row, col) in `Grid A` is white (0) AND the pixel at (row, col) in `Grid B` is also white (0), then the corresponding pixel at (row, col) in the output grid is white (0).
    *   This behaves like a logical OR operation applied pixel-wise across the two input subgrids, where blue and red represent 'true' and white represents 'false', resulting in green for 'true' and white for 'false'.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Perform a pixel-wise combination of two subgrids separated by a specific marker line.
grid_elements:
  - type: separator
    color: yellow (4)
    shape: horizontal line
    function: Divides the input grid into two main parts.
  - type: subgrid
    name: Grid A
    location: Above the separator line.
    pixels:
      - blue (1)
      - white (0)
    role: Input 1 for the combination operation.
  - type: subgrid
    name: Grid B
    location: Below the separator line.
    pixels:
      - red (2)
      - white (0)
    role: Input 2 for the combination operation.
  - type: subgrid
    name: Output Grid
    pixels:
      - green (3)
      - white (0)
    role: Result of the combination operation.
    properties:
      - Has the same dimensions as Grid A and Grid B.
relationships:
  - Grid A and Grid B always have identical dimensions within the same example.
  - The Output Grid always has the same dimensions as Grid A and Grid B.
  - The yellow separator line is always present and separates Grid A from Grid B.
transformation:
  type: pixel-wise combination (logical OR equivalent)
  rule: For each coordinate (row, col):
    - condition: If Grid_A[row, col] is blue (1) OR Grid_B[row, col] is red (2)
      result: Output_Grid[row, col] becomes green (3)
    - condition: If Grid_A[row, col] is white (0) AND Grid_B[row, col] is white (0)
      result: Output_Grid[row, col] becomes white (0)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the horizontal line of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. This line acts as a separator.
2.  Extract the subgrid located above the yellow line (let's call it `Grid A`). `Grid A` contains blue (1) and white (0) pixels.
3.  Extract the subgrid located below the yellow line (let's call it `Grid B`). `Grid B` contains red (2) and white (0) pixels. Note that `Grid A` and `Grid B` will have the same dimensions.
4.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as `Grid A` and `Grid B`.
5.  Iterate through each pixel position (row, col) within the dimensions of `Grid A` (and `Grid B`).
6.  For each position (row, col):
    *   Check the color of the pixel at `Grid A[row, col]` and `Grid B[row, col]`.
    *   If the pixel in `Grid A` is blue (1) OR the pixel in `Grid B` is red (2), set the pixel at `Output_Grid[row, col]` to green (3).
    *   Otherwise (meaning both pixels are white (0)), set the pixel at `Output_Grid[row, col]` to white (0).
7.  Return the completed output grid.
