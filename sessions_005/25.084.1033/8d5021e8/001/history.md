*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids are small (3x2 pixels).
    *   The output grids are significantly larger (9x4 pixels).
    *   The output height is exactly 3 times the input height (9 = 3 * 3).
    *   The output width is exactly 2 times the input width (4 = 2 * 2).
    *   This suggests the output grid is constructed by tiling multiple copies or versions of the input grid.
    *   Observing the patterns within the output grids, they appear to be composed of 6 blocks, each the size of the original input (3x2).
    *   These blocks are arranged in a 3 (rows) x 2 (columns) configuration.
    *   Comparing the content of these blocks to the original input reveals that they are transformed versions: original, flipped horizontally, flipped vertically, and rotated 180 degrees.
    *   The specific arrangement of these transformed blocks seems consistent across all examples. Let's denote the transformations: `Original` (I), `FlipHorizontal` (H), `FlipVertical` (V), `Rotate180` (R).
    *   The pattern appears to be:
        
```
        [R] [V]
        [H] [I]
        [R] [V]
        ```

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the height (h) and width (w) of the input grid.
    2.  Calculate the dimensions of the output grid: height = 3 * h, width = 2 * w.
    3.  Create four transformed versions of the input grid:
        a.  `Original`: The input grid itself.
        b.  `Flipped_H`: The input grid flipped horizontally.
        c.  `Flipped_V`: The input grid flipped vertically.
        d.  `Rotated_180`: The input grid rotated 180 degrees (which is equivalent to flipping horizontally and then vertically).
    4.  Create a new output grid with the calculated dimensions (3h x 2w), initially filled with a default color (e.g., white/0, although the examples show pixels are fully replaced).
    5.  Place the transformed grids into the output grid in a 3x2 block arrangement:
        *   Place `Rotated_180` in the top-left section (rows 0 to h-1, cols 0 to w-1).
        *   Place `Flipped_V` in the top-right section (rows 0 to h-1, cols w to 2w-1).
        *   Place `Flipped_H` in the middle-left section (rows h to 2h-1, cols 0 to w-1).
        *   Place `Original` in the middle-right section (rows h to 2h-1, cols w to 2w-1).
        *   Place `Rotated_180` in the bottom-left section (rows 2h to 3h-1, cols 0 to w-1).
        *   Place `Flipped_V` in the bottom-right section (rows 2h to 3h-1, cols w to 2w-1).
    6.  Return the constructed output grid.
