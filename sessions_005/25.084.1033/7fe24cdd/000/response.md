Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Grid Transformation:** The core task is transforming an input grid into a larger output grid.
2.  **Size Change:** The output grid is consistently twice the height and twice the width of the input grid. In the examples, 3x3 input grids become 6x6 output grids.
3.  **Quadrant Structure:** The output grid appears to be composed of four distinct sub-grids or quadrants, each the same size as the original input grid.
4.  **Content Relationship:**
    *   The top-left quadrant of the output grid is an exact copy of the input grid.
    *   The other three quadrants contain the pixels of the input grid but rearranged. Closer inspection suggests these rearrangements are rotations of the original input grid.
5.  **Rotational Pattern:** Based on analyzing the examples:
    *   The top-right quadrant seems to be the input grid rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
    *   The bottom-left quadrant seems to be the input grid rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise (or 270 degrees clockwise).
    *   The bottom-right quadrant seems to be the input grid rotated 180 degrees.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Determine its dimensions: height `N` and width `M`.
3.  Create a new output grid with dimensions `2N` height and `2M` width, initialized with a default color (e.g., white/0), although the initialization color doesn't matter as all cells will be overwritten.
4.  Calculate the four rotated versions of the input grid:
    *   `original = input_grid`
    *   `rotated_90_cw = rotate input_grid 90 degrees clockwise`
    *   `rotated_90_ccw = rotate input_grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise`
    *   `rotated_180 = rotate input_grid 180 degrees`
5.  Assemble the output grid by placing these grids into the four quadrants:
    *   Place `original` into the top-left quadrant (rows `0` to `N-1`, columns `0` to `M-1`).
    *   Place `rotated_90_cw` into the top-right quadrant (rows `0` to `N-1`, columns `M` to `2M-1`).
    *   Place `rotated_90_ccw` into the bottom-left quadrant (rows `N` to `2N-1`, columns `0` to `M-1`).
    *   Place `rotated_180` into the bottom-right quadrant (rows `N` to `2N-1`, columns `M` to `2M-1`).
6.  Return the assembled output grid.
