Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Size Transformation**: The most immediate observation is the change in grid dimensions. In both examples, a 3x3 input grid becomes a 9x9 output grid. This suggests a scaling factor of 3 in both height and width.
2.  **Pixel Mapping**: Each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a larger area in the output grid. Specifically, a single pixel in the input seems to expand into a 3x3 block of the same color in the output.
3.  **Positional Correspondence**: The position of the 3x3 block in the output grid directly relates to the position of the original pixel in the input grid. The top-left input pixel maps to the top-left 3x3 output block, the input pixel to its right maps to the 3x3 output block immediately to the right, and so on. If the input pixel is at `(row, col)`, the corresponding 3x3 block in the output starts at `(row * 3, col * 3)`.
4.  **Color Preservation**: The color of the original input pixel is preserved and used to fill the entire corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid. No new colors are introduced, and existing colors are simply replicated within their expanded blocks.
5.  **No Complex Object Interaction**: The transformation appears to be a direct pixel-wise scaling or "zoom" operation. There are no interactions between different colored pixels or objects based on shape or adjacency beyond their individual scaling.

input_output_pairs:
  - example: train_1
    input_grid_size: [3, 3]

    mapping: pixel_to_block
    block_size: [3, 3]
    rule: Each input pixel at (r, c) with color C maps to a 3x3 block in the output grid starting at (r*3, c*3), filled entirely with color C.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty output grid whose height is 3 times the input grid height and whose width is 3 times the input grid width.
2.  For each row `r` from 0 to the input grid height minus 1:
3.  For each column `c` from 0 to the input grid width minus 1:
4.  Identify the color `C` of the pixel at position `(r, c)` in the input grid.
5.  Determine the top-left corner `(R, C)` of the corresponding block in the output grid, where `R = r * 3` and `C = c * 3`.
6.  Fill the 3x3 square block in the output grid starting at `(R, C)` (i.e., rows `R` to `R+2` and columns `C` to `C+2`) entirely with the color `C`.
7.  After iterating through all input pixels, return the completed output grid.
