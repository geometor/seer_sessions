task_type: grid_transformation
transformation_name: scale_up_3x
input_output_pairs:
  - example: train_1
    input_grid_size: [3, 3]
    output_grid_size: [9, 9]
    size_relation: output_height = input_height * 3, output_width = input_width * 3
    mapping: pixel_to_block
    block_size: [3, 3]
    rule: Each input pixel at (r, c) with color C maps to a 3x3 block in the output grid starting at (r*3, c*3), filled entirely with color C.
  - example: train_2
    input_grid_size: [3, 3]

    size_relation: output_height = input_height * 3, output_width = input_width * 3
    mapping: pixel_to_block
    block_size: [3, 3]
    rule: Each input pixel at (r, c) with color C maps to a 3x3 block in the output grid starting at (r*3, c*3), filled entirely with color C.
grid_elements:
  - type: pixels
    attributes: [color, position]
actions:
  - name: scale_up
    factor: 3
    target: each pixel in the input grid
    result: creates a 3x3 block of the same color in the output grid
    positional_mapping: input(r, c) -> output_block(r*3:r*3+3, c*3:c*3+3)
