Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure**: Both input and output grids are 2D arrays of pixels with values representing colors. The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical within each example pair (3x3 for train_1, 5x5 for train_2 and train_3).
2.  **Colors**: The primary colors involved are white (0), azure (8), and red (2). White seems to be the background color. Azure is present only in the input, and red is present only in the output (replacing azure).
3.  **Objects**: In each input grid, there is a distinct object composed entirely of azure (8) pixels. The shape and size of this object vary across examples (1 pixel in train_1, 2x2 block in train_2, 1x3 block in train_3).
4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation appears to involve the azure object.
    *   **Movement**: The azure object consistently shifts downwards by one row. Its horizontal position remains unchanged.
    *   **Color Change**: The color of the object changes from azure (8) in the input to red (2) in the output.
5.  **Background**: The white (0) background pixels remain unchanged in their positions and color.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
components:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    persistence: unchanged
    location: all pixels not part of the foreground object
  - role: foreground_object
    input_color: azure (8)
    output_color: red (2)
    properties:
      - shape: variable (single pixel, 2x2 block, 1x3 block in examples)
      - contiguous: true
    actions:
      - type: translation
        direction: down
        magnitude: 1 pixel (row index increases by 1)
      - type: color_change
        from: azure (8)
        to: red (2)
relationships:
  - The foreground object is defined by its azure color in the input.
  - The output object's position is determined by shifting the input object down by one row.
  - The output object's color is always red.
grid_properties:
  - dimension_preservation: input and output grids have the same height and width.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that have the color azure (8).
3.  For each identified azure pixel at coordinates (row, column):
    a. Calculate the target coordinates in the output grid by adding 1 to the row index: (row + 1, column).
    b. Set the color of the pixel at the target coordinates (row + 1, column) in the output grid to red (2).
4.  Return the completed output grid.
