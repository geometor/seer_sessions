The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical within each example pair (3x3 for train_1, 5x5 for train_2 and train_3).\n2.  **Colors**: The primary colors involved are white (0), azure (8), and red (2). White seems to be the background color. Azure is present only in the input, and red is present only in the output (replacing azure).\n3.  **Objects**: In each input grid, there is a distinct object composed entirely of azure (8) pixels. The shape and size of this object vary across examples (1 pixel in train_1, 2x2 block in train_2, 1x3 block in train_3).\n4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation appears to involve the azure object.\n    *   **Movement**: The azure object consistently shifts downwards by one row. Its horizontal position remains unchanged.\n    *   **Color Change**: The color of the object changes from azure (8) in the input to red (2) in the output.\n5.  **Background**: The white (0) background pixels remain unchanged in their positions and color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
