"""
Transforms a 2x2 input grid into a 6x6 output grid by tiling.
The output grid is composed of 3x3 tiles, where each tile is the size of the input grid (2x2).
Tiles in the top (row 0) and bottom (row 2) rows of the 3x3 tiling pattern are identical copies of the input grid.
Tiles in the middle row (row 1) of the 3x3 tiling pattern are horizontally flipped copies of the input grid.
