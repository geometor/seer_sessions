*   **Perception:**
    *   The input is always a 2x2 grid of colors.
    *   The output is always a 6x6 grid of colors. The output grid's dimensions are exactly 3 times the input grid's dimensions (3 * 2 = 6).
    *   The output grid appears to be constructed by tiling 2x2 blocks. There are 3x3 = 9 such blocks in the 6x6 output.
    *   Comparing the output blocks to the input grid reveals a pattern:
        *   The blocks in the first row (top) of the output are identical copies of the input grid.
        *   The blocks in the second row (middle) of the output are horizontally flipped copies of the input grid.
        *   The blocks in the third row (bottom) of the output are identical copies of the input grid.
    *   The transformation involves replicating the input grid and its horizontally flipped version in a specific 3x3 tiling pattern to form the larger output grid.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the input grid (let's call it `input_grid`). Note its dimensions (height H=2, width W=2).
    2.  Create a horizontally flipped version of the `input_grid` (let's call it `flipped_grid`). This involves reversing the order of the columns for each row.
    3.  Determine the output grid dimensions: 3 times the height and 3 times the width of the `input_grid` (Output Height = 3*H = 6, Output Width = 3*W = 6).
    4.  Create an empty output grid of the calculated dimensions (6x6).
    5.  Fill the output grid by placing 2x2 tiles (the size of the `input_grid`) in a 3x3 pattern:
        *   For the tile positions in the first row (row index 0) and third row (row index 2) of the 3x3 pattern, use the `input_grid` as the tile.
        *   For the tile positions in the second row (row index 1) of the 3x3 pattern, use the `flipped_grid` as the tile.
        *   Specifically:
            *   Place `input_grid` at output grid coordinates (0,0), (0,2), (0,4).
            *   Place `flipped_grid` at output grid coordinates (2,0), (2,2), (2,4).
            *   Place `input_grid` at output grid coordinates (4,0), (4,2), (4,4).
