Transformation Rule:
1. Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2. Locate the single pixel with the color red (2) within the input grid. Record its column index, `c_in`.
3. Create a new output grid with the same dimensions (H x W) as the input grid.
4. Fill the entire output grid with the background color magenta (6).
5. Determine the starting column (`c_out`) for the 2x2 red square in the output grid based on the input red pixel's column index (`c_in`):
    *   If `c_in` is less than `W / 2`, set `c_out` to 0.
    *   Otherwise (if `c_in` is greater than or equal to `W / 2`), set `c_out` to `W / 2` (integer division).
6. Determine the starting row (`r_out`) for the 2x2 red square, which is always `H / 2` (integer division).
7. Fill the 2x2 area in the output grid starting at position (`r_out`, `c_out`) with the color red (2).
8. Return the modified output grid.
