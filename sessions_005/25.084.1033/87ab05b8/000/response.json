The position of this red pixel varies.\n    *   Other colors present in the inputs (maroon-9, blue-1, yellow-4, gray-5, white-0, azure-8) do not appear in the outputs.\n    *   The output grids are also 4x4.\n    *   The output grids consist mostly of the magenta background color (6).\n    *   Each output grid features a 2x2 square of red pixels (2) located in the bottom half of the grid.\n    *   The horizontal position of this 2x2 red square in the output seems dependent on the horizontal position of the single red pixel in the input.\n    *   If the input red pixel is in the left half (columns 0 or 1), the output 2x2 red square is in the bottom-left corner (starting at row 2, column 0).\n    *   If the input red pixel is in the right half (columns 2 or 3), the output 2x2 red square is in the bottom-right corner (starting at row 2, column 2).\n    *   The top half (rows 0 and 1) of the output grid is always filled with the magenta background color (6).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
