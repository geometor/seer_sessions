    2. For each cell I[r, c]:
       a. Count the number of neighbors (N) in I (including diagonals) that have the NonBG color.
       b. Determine the color of the corresponding cell Q[r, c]:
          - If I[r, c] is NonBG, then Q[r, c] becomes BG.
          - If I[r, c] is BG:
            - If N > 0, then Q[r, c] becomes NonBG.
            - If N == 0, then Q[r, c] remains BG.
    3. The final output grid is created by tiling the intermediate grid Q in a 2x2 pattern.
