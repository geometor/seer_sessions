task_description: Tile the input grid in a 2x2 arrangement to create the output grid.
grid_properties:
  - name: input_grid
    attributes:
      - height: H
      - width: W
  - name: output_grid
    attributes:
      - height: 2 * H
      - width: 2 * W
      - content: A 2x2 tiling of the input_grid.
transformation:
  - type: tiling
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    repetition:
      - axis: horizontal
        count: 2
      - axis: vertical
        count: 2
relationship:
  - The output grid's dimensions are exactly double the input grid's dimensions.
  - The pattern in the input grid is repeated four times in the output grid, arranged in a 2x2 layout.
