task_description: Rearrange scattered colored pixels from an input grid into a 3x3 output grid based on their location within a 3x3 partitioning of the input grid.

elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
      - dimensions: H x W (variable, divisible by 3 in examples)
      - content: Mostly white pixels (0) with sparsely distributed non-white pixels (1-9).
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
      - dimensions: 3 x 3 (fixed)
      - content: Contains only the non-white pixels from the input grid.
  - object: subgrid (block)
    properties:
      - derived_from: input_grid
      - quantity: 9 (arranged in a 3x3 pattern)
      - dimensions: (H/3) x (W/3)
      - content: Contains exactly one non-white pixel (based on examples).

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    from: non-white pixel in input_grid subgrid at block coordinates (BR, BC)
    to: pixel at coordinates (BR, BC) in output_grid
    condition: The pixel value (color) is transferred.

actions:
  - name: partition_input
    origin: input_grid
    target: 9 subgrids
    details: Divide the input grid into 9 equal rectangular subgrids arranged in a 3x3 pattern.
  - name: locate_pixel
    origin: subgrid
    target: non-white pixel
    details: Find the single non-white pixel within each subgrid.
  - name: construct_output
    origin: non-white pixels from subgrids
    target: output_grid
    details: Place the located non-white pixel from the subgrid at block coordinates (BR, BC) into the output grid at cell coordinates (BR, BC).

assumptions:
  - Input grid dimensions (H, W) are always divisible by 3.
  - Each subgrid resulting from the 3x3 partitioning contains exactly one non-white pixel.
