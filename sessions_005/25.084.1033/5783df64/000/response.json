The outputs are always smaller, specifically 3x3 grids.\n2.  **Content Preservation:** All the non-white pixels from the input grid appear in the output grid. No new non-white pixels are introduced, and none are lost. The white background pixels from the input are discarded.\n3.  **Structure Transformation:** The core transformation involves rearranging the non-white input pixels into a fixed 3x3 output grid. The relative spatial relationship is not directly preserved (e.g., it's not a simple crop or resize).\n4.  **Block Pattern:** By observing the examples, it appears the input grid is conceptually divided into a 3x3 grid of equal-sized rectangular blocks or subgrids. The dimensions of these blocks are (Input Height / 3) x (Input Width / 3).\n5.  **Pixel Mapping:** Each block in the 3x3 division of the input contains exactly one non-white pixel (based on the examples). The color of the non-white pixel found within the block at position (Block Row, Block Col) in the input's 3x3 division corresponds to the pixel value at position (Row, Col) in the 3x3 output grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
