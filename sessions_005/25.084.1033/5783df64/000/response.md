Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output:** The inputs are larger grids (9x9 or 6x6) containing mostly white pixels (0) and a few scattered non-white pixels (colors 1-9). The outputs are always smaller, specifically 3x3 grids.
2.  **Content Preservation:** All the non-white pixels from the input grid appear in the output grid. No new non-white pixels are introduced, and none are lost. The white background pixels from the input are discarded.
3.  **Structure Transformation:** The core transformation involves rearranging the non-white input pixels into a fixed 3x3 output grid. The relative spatial relationship is not directly preserved (e.g., it's not a simple crop or resize).
4.  **Block Pattern:** By observing the examples, it appears the input grid is conceptually divided into a 3x3 grid of equal-sized rectangular blocks or subgrids. The dimensions of these blocks are (Input Height / 3) x (Input Width / 3).
5.  **Pixel Mapping:** Each block in the 3x3 division of the input contains exactly one non-white pixel (based on the examples). The color of the non-white pixel found within the block at position (Block Row, Block Col) in the input's 3x3 division corresponds to the pixel value at position (Row, Col) in the 3x3 output grid.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange scattered colored pixels from an input grid into a 3x3 output grid based on their location within a 3x3 partitioning of the input grid.

elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
      - dimensions: H x W (variable, divisible by 3 in examples)
      - content: Mostly white pixels (0) with sparsely distributed non-white pixels (1-9).
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
      - dimensions: 3 x 3 (fixed)
      - content: Contains only the non-white pixels from the input grid.
  - object: subgrid (block)
    properties:
      - derived_from: input_grid
      - quantity: 9 (arranged in a 3x3 pattern)
      - dimensions: (H/3) x (W/3)
      - content: Contains exactly one non-white pixel (based on examples).

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    from: non-white pixel in input_grid subgrid at block coordinates (BR, BC)
    to: pixel at coordinates (BR, BC) in output_grid
    condition: The pixel value (color) is transferred.

actions:
  - name: partition_input
    origin: input_grid
    target: 9 subgrids
    details: Divide the input grid into 9 equal rectangular subgrids arranged in a 3x3 pattern.
  - name: locate_pixel
    origin: subgrid
    target: non-white pixel
    details: Find the single non-white pixel within each subgrid.
  - name: construct_output
    origin: non-white pixels from subgrids
    target: output_grid
    details: Place the located non-white pixel from the subgrid at block coordinates (BR, BC) into the output grid at cell coordinates (BR, BC).

assumptions:
  - Input grid dimensions (H, W) are always divisible by 3.
  - Each subgrid resulting from the 3x3 partitioning contains exactly one non-white pixel.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Calculate the dimensions of the subgrids (blocks): `block_height = H / 3`, `block_width = W / 3`.
3.  Create a new 3x3 grid, initialized with white pixels (0), which will be the output grid.
4.  Iterate through the 3x3 grid of blocks in the input, using block row index `br` from 0 to 2 and block column index `bc` from 0 to 2.
5.  For each block defined by the top-left corner `(br * block_height, bc * block_width)` and bottom-right corner `((br + 1) * block_height - 1, (bc + 1) * block_width - 1)`:
    a.  Scan the pixels within this block.
    b.  Find the first (and assumed only) non-white pixel encountered. Let its color value be `color`.
    c.  Place this `color` into the output grid at coordinates `(br, bc)`.
6.  Return the completed 3x3 output grid.
