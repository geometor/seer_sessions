task_elements:
  - description: Input and Output Grids
    properties:
      format: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      colors_observed: [orange (7), blue (1), gray (5), azure (8)] # Others might be present but aren't primary actors
      dimensions: Variable height and width (observed examples: 3x4, 3x6, 3x5)

objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)

relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    definition: A pixel at (r1, c1) is adjacent to a pixel at (r2, c2) if max(abs(r1-r2), abs(c1-c2)) == 1. This includes orthogonal and diagonal neighbors.

actions:
  - name: Color Change
    input_object: Pixel with color orange (7)
    output_object: Pixel with color gray (5)
    condition: The orange (7) pixel must be adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to at least one pixel with color blue (1).
    unchanged_elements: All pixels that are not orange (7), and orange (7) pixels that do not meet the adjacency condition.

goal:
  - description: Modify the input grid by changing specific orange pixels to gray based on their adjacency to blue pixels.
