The grid dimensions vary across examples.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The relevant colors observed are orange (`7`), blue (`1`), gray (`5`), and azure (`8`). Other colors might exist but don't seem directly involved in the transformation rule itself, though they form the context.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing specific pixels from orange (`7`) to gray (`5`). Not all orange pixels change. Other colored pixels (like blue `1` and azure `8`) remain unchanged in their positions and color.\n4.  **Condition for Change:** By comparing the input and output grids, the orange (`7`) pixels that change to gray (`5`) are consistently those that have at least one blue (`1`) pixel as a neighbor. Neighboring includes pixels directly adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally (all 8 surrounding cells).\n5.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds across all three training examples. Orange pixels (`7`) not adjacent (in any of the 8 directions) to a blue pixel (`1`) remain orange (`7`). Pixels of colors other than orange do not change.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
