Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both inputs and outputs are rectangular grids of colored pixels. The grid dimensions vary across examples.
2.  **Color Palette:** The relevant colors observed are orange (`7`), blue (`1`), gray (`5`), and azure (`8`). Other colors might exist but don't seem directly involved in the transformation rule itself, though they form the context.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing specific pixels from orange (`7`) to gray (`5`). Not all orange pixels change. Other colored pixels (like blue `1` and azure `8`) remain unchanged in their positions and color.
4.  **Condition for Change:** By comparing the input and output grids, the orange (`7`) pixels that change to gray (`5`) are consistently those that have at least one blue (`1`) pixel as a neighbor. Neighboring includes pixels directly adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally (all 8 surrounding cells).
5.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds across all three training examples. Orange pixels (`7`) not adjacent (in any of the 8 directions) to a blue pixel (`1`) remain orange (`7`). Pixels of colors other than orange do not change.

## Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - description: Input and Output Grids
    properties:
      format: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      colors_observed: [orange (7), blue (1), gray (5), azure (8)] # Others might be present but aren't primary actors
      dimensions: Variable height and width (observed examples: 3x4, 3x6, 3x5)

objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)

relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    definition: A pixel at (r1, c1) is adjacent to a pixel at (r2, c2) if max(abs(r1-r2), abs(c1-c2)) == 1. This includes orthogonal and diagonal neighbors.

actions:
  - name: Color Change
    input_object: Pixel with color orange (7)
    output_object: Pixel with color gray (5)
    condition: The orange (7) pixel must be adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to at least one pixel with color blue (1).
    unchanged_elements: All pixels that are not orange (7), and orange (7) pixels that do not meet the adjacency condition.

goal:
  - description: Modify the input grid by changing specific orange pixels to gray based on their adjacency to blue pixels.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially copying all pixel values from the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel in the input grid using its row and column index.
3.  For the current pixel being examined, check if its color is orange (`7`).
4.  If the pixel is orange (`7`):
    a.  Examine all its adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right, and all four diagonals).
    b.  Check if any of these neighbors has the color blue (`1`).
    c.  If at least one neighbor is blue (`1`), change the color of the corresponding pixel in the *new* grid to gray (`5`).
    d.  If no neighbor is blue (`1`), the corresponding pixel in the new grid retains its original orange (`7`) color (already copied in step 1).
5.  If the current pixel's color is *not* orange (`7`), its value in the new grid remains unchanged (already copied in step 1).
6.  After checking all pixels, the new grid represents the final output.
