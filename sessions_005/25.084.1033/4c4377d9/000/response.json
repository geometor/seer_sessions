The height doubles while the width remains the same.\n2.  **Content Preservation**: The colors present in the input grid are the only colors present in the output grid. No new colors are introduced, and no existing colors are removed.\n3.  **Structural Relationship**: The output grid appears to be composed of two parts stacked vertically.\n    *   The bottom half of the output grid (rows 3, 4, 5) is identical to the input grid (rows 0, 1, 2).\n    *   The top half of the output grid (rows 0, 1, 2) appears to be a vertical reflection (flipped upside down) of the input grid. Row 0 of the output matches row 2 of the input, row 1 of the output matches row 1 of the input, and row 2 of the output matches row 0 of the input.\n4.  **Consistency**: This pattern of vertical reflection followed by concatenation holds true for all four training examples.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
