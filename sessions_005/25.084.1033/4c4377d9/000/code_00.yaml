task_context:
  - description: The task involves transforming an input grid into a larger output grid by reflecting and concatenating the input.
  - input_grid_properties:
      - height: 3 (consistent across examples)
      - width: 4 (consistent across examples)
      - colors: Varies per example (maroon, yellow, blue, green, gray)
  - output_grid_properties:
      - height: 6 (double the input height)
      - width: 4 (same as input width)
      - colors: Same set of colors as the corresponding input grid.
transformation_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Reflect the input grid vertically (flip upside down).
    input: original input grid
    output: reflected grid
    details: The top row of the input becomes the bottom row of the reflected grid, the second row remains the second row, and the bottom row becomes the top row.
  - step: 2
    action: Create the output grid.
    details:
      - The output grid has the same width as the input grid and twice the height.
      - Place the reflected grid (from step 1) in the top half of the output grid.
      - Place the original input grid in the bottom half of the output grid.
relationship:
  - The output grid is a composite structure formed by stacking a vertically reflected version of the input grid on top of the original input grid.
