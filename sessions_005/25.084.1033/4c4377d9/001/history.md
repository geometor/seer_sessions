## Perception

1.  **Grid Dimensions**: All input grids are 3x4. All output grids are 6x4. The height doubles while the width remains the same.
2.  **Content Preservation**: The colors present in the input grid are the only colors present in the output grid. No new colors are introduced, and no existing colors are removed.
3.  **Structural Relationship**: The output grid appears to be composed of two parts stacked vertically.
    *   The bottom half of the output grid (rows 3, 4, 5) is identical to the input grid (rows 0, 1, 2).
    *   The top half of the output grid (rows 0, 1, 2) appears to be a vertical reflection (flipped upside down) of the input grid. Row 0 of the output matches row 2 of the input, row 1 of the output matches row 1 of the input, and row 2 of the output matches row 0 of the input.
4.  **Consistency**: This pattern of vertical reflection followed by concatenation holds true for all four training examples.

## Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  - description: The task involves transforming an input grid into a larger output grid by reflecting and concatenating the input.
  - input_grid_properties:
      - height: 3 (consistent across examples)
      - width: 4 (consistent across examples)
      - colors: Varies per example (maroon, yellow, blue, green, gray)
  - output_grid_properties:
      - height: 6 (double the input height)
      - width: 4 (same as input width)
      - colors: Same set of colors as the corresponding input grid.
transformation_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Reflect the input grid vertically (flip upside down).
    input: original input grid
    output: reflected grid
    details: The top row of the input becomes the bottom row of the reflected grid, the second row remains the second row, and the bottom row becomes the top row.
  - step: 2
    action: Create the output grid.
    details:
      - The output grid has the same width as the input grid and twice the height.
      - Place the reflected grid (from step 1) in the top half of the output grid.
      - Place the original input grid in the bottom half of the output grid.
relationship:
  - The output grid is a composite structure formed by stacking a vertically reflected version of the input grid on top of the original input grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Take the input grid.
2.  Create a new grid which is a vertical reflection (flipped upside down) of the input grid.
3.  Create the output grid with the same width as the input grid and twice the height.
4.  Copy the reflected grid into the top half of the output grid (rows 0 to height-1, where height is the input grid's height).
5.  Copy the original input grid into the bottom half of the output grid (rows height to 2*height-1).
6.  Return the resulting output grid.
