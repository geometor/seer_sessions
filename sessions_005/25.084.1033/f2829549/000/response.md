Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Grid Sizes**: All input grids are 4 rows by 7 columns. All output grids are 4 rows by 3 columns.
2.  **Color Palette**:
    *   Inputs use orange (7), white (0), blue (1), and gray (5).
    *   Outputs use only white (0) and green (3).
3.  **Input Structure**: Each input grid has a distinct vertical line of blue (1) pixels in the 4th column (index 3). This line acts as a separator, dividing the input into a 4x3 left section and a 4x3 right section.
4.  **Transformation Logic**:
    *   The output grid dimensions (4x3) match the dimensions of the left (and right) sections of the input grid.
    *   The content of the output grid seems to depend on a comparison between the pixels in the left section and the corresponding pixels in the right section of the input grid.
    *   Specifically, a pixel at `(row, col)` in the output grid appears to be green (3) if and only if the corresponding pixels in *both* the left section (`Input[row, col]`) and the right section (`Input[row, col + 4]`) of the input grid are white (0).
    *   If either the left pixel or the right pixel (or both) are non-white, the corresponding output pixel at `(row, col)` is white (0).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the input grid. Note its height (H) and width (W). Confirm the presence of a vertical blue line separator at column index 3.
2.  Define the dimensions of the output grid: Height = H, Width = 3.
3.  Create a new grid (the output grid) with these dimensions, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
4.  Iterate through each row `r` from 0 to H-1.
5.  For each row `r`, iterate through each column `c` from 0 to 2 (the width of the left section).
6.  Get the color value of the pixel in the left section of the input grid at `(r, c)`. Let this be `left_pixel_color`.
7.  Get the color value of the pixel in the right section of the input grid at `(r, c + 4)`. Let this be `right_pixel_color`.
8.  Check if `left_pixel_color` is white (0) AND `right_pixel_color` is white (0).
9.  If both conditions in step 8 are true, set the pixel value in the output grid at `(r, c)` to green (3).
10. If the condition in step 8 is false (i.e., at least one of the corresponding pixels is not white), the output pixel at `(r, c)` remains white (0) (as initialized in step 3).
11. After iterating through all rows and relevant columns, the resulting grid is the final output.
