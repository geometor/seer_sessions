Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are consistently 3x3 in size across all examples.
2.  **Color Palette:** The input grids use white (0) and blue (1). The output grids use white (0) and red (2).
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation appears to map the presence and quantity of blue pixels in the input grid to a specific pattern of red pixels in the output grid. The positions of the input blue pixels don't seem to matter directly, only their total count.
4.  **Output Pattern:** The red pixels in the output always appear at specific, fixed coordinates: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), and (1,1). The rest of the output grid remains white (0).
5.  **Counting Mechanism:** By comparing inputs with different numbers of blue pixels to their corresponding outputs, a clear pattern emerges:
    *   1 blue pixel results in a red pixel only at (0,0). (Examples 9, 10)
    *   2 blue pixels result in red pixels at (0,0) and (0,1). (Examples 3, 7, 8)
    *   3 blue pixels result in red pixels at (0,0), (0,1), and (0,2). (Examples 2, 6)
    *   4 blue pixels result in red pixels at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), and (1,1). (Examples 1, 4, 5)
6.  **Threshold Logic:** The appearance of red pixels at specific output locations seems governed by thresholds based on the total count of blue pixels in the input.

## Facts


```yaml
Grid:
  - type: Input
    attributes:
      size: 3x3
      colors: [white, blue]
  - type: Output
    attributes:
      size: 3x3
      colors: [white, red]

Objects:
  - type: Pixel Group
    attributes:
      color: blue
      value: 1
      location: variable within input grid

Properties:
  - name: blue_pixel_count
    description: The total number of blue pixels (value 1) in the input grid.
    value_range: 0 to 9 (in these examples, 1 to 4)

Relationships & Transformation:
  - rule: The transformation depends solely on the 'blue_pixel_count'.
  - mapping:
      - condition: blue_pixel_count >= 1
        action: Set output pixel at (0,0) to red (2).
      - condition: blue_pixel_count >= 2
        action: Set output pixel at (0,1) to red (2).
      - condition: blue_pixel_count >= 3
        action: Set output pixel at (0,2) to red (2).
      - condition: blue_pixel_count >= 4
        action: Set output pixel at (1,1) to red (2).
  - default: All other output pixels are set to white (0).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize a 3x3 output grid with all white (0) pixels.
2.  Count the total number of blue (1) pixels in the input grid. Let this count be `N`.
3.  Check the value of `N` against specific thresholds and update the output grid accordingly:
    *   If `N` is 1 or greater, change the color of the output pixel at coordinate (row=0, column=0) to red (2).
    *   If `N` is 2 or greater, change the color of the output pixel at coordinate (row=0, column=1) to red (2).
    *   If `N` is 3 or greater, change the color of the output pixel at coordinate (row=0, column=2) to red (2).
    *   If `N` is 4 or greater, change the color of the output pixel at coordinate (row=1, column=1) to red (2).
4.  Return the final 3x3 output grid.
