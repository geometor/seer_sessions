Grid:
  - type: Input
    attributes:
      size: 3x3
      colors: [white, blue]
  - type: Output
    attributes:
      size: 3x3
      colors: [white, red]

Objects:
  - type: Pixel Group
    attributes:
      color: blue
      value: 1
      location: variable within input grid

Properties:
  - name: blue_pixel_count
    description: The total number of blue pixels (value 1) in the input grid.
    value_range: 0 to 9 (in these examples, 1 to 4)

Relationships & Transformation:
  - rule: The transformation depends solely on the 'blue_pixel_count'.
  - mapping:
      - condition: blue_pixel_count >= 1
        action: Set output pixel at (0,0) to red (2).
      - condition: blue_pixel_count >= 2
        action: Set output pixel at (0,1) to red (2).
      - condition: blue_pixel_count >= 3
        action: Set output pixel at (0,2) to red (2).
      - condition: blue_pixel_count >= 4
        action: Set output pixel at (1,1) to red (2).
  - default: All other output pixels are set to white (0).
