Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Size:** In all examples, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x6 grid. This suggests the output grid's dimensions are double the input grid's dimensions.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid appears to be composed of four distinct 3x3 blocks arranged in a 2x2 pattern.
3.  **Relationship between Input and Output Blocks:**
    *   The top-left block (quadrant) of the output grid is identical to the input grid.
    *   The top-right block seems to be a horizontal reflection (mirror image) of the input grid.
    *   The bottom-left block seems to be a vertical reflection (upside-down image) of the input grid.
    *   The bottom-right block seems to be both a horizontal and vertical reflection (or a 180-degree rotation) of the input grid.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves reflecting the input grid horizontally, vertically, and both, then tiling these four versions (original, horizontal flip, vertical flip, combined flip) to form the larger output grid.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Create a larger grid by tiling the input grid and its reflections.
grid_properties:
  - input_grid:
      attributes: [height H, width W]
  - output_grid:
      attributes: [height 2*H, width 2*W]
composition:
  - output_grid: composed of four quadrants, each of size H x W.
quadrants:
  - top_left:
      relation: identical to input_grid
      position: rows 0 to H-1, cols 0 to W-1
  - top_right:
      relation: horizontal flip of input_grid
      position: rows 0 to H-1, cols W to 2*W-1
  - bottom_left:
      relation: vertical flip of input_grid
      position: rows H to 2*H-1, cols 0 to W-1
  - bottom_right:
      relation: horizontal and vertical flip of input_grid
      position: rows H to 2*H-1, cols W to 2*W-1
actions:
  - flip_horizontal: Reverse the order of columns in the grid.
  - flip_vertical: Reverse the order of rows in the grid.
  - tile: Arrange grids adjacent to each other to form a larger grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Define the input grid `I`. Let its height be `H` and width be `W`.
2.  Create three transformed grids based on `I`:
    a.  `I_hflip`: Flip `I` horizontally.
    b.  `I_vflip`: Flip `I` vertically.
    c.  `I_vhflip`: Flip `I` both horizontally and vertically (equivalent to flipping `I_hflip` vertically or `I_vflip` horizontally).
3.  Create a new output grid `O` with dimensions `2*H` by `2*W`.
4.  Construct the output grid `O` by placing the grids as follows:
    a.  Place `I` in the top-left quadrant of `O` (rows 0 to `H-1`, columns 0 to `W-1`).
    b.  Place `I_hflip` in the top-right quadrant of `O` (rows 0 to `H-1`, columns `W` to `2*W-1`).
    c.  Place `I_vflip` in the bottom-left quadrant of `O` (rows `H` to `2*H-1`, columns 0 to `W-1`).
    d.  Place `I_vhflip` in the bottom-right quadrant of `O` (rows `H` to `2*H-1`, columns `W` to `2*W-1`).
5.  Return the final output grid `O`.
