            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Size:** In all examples, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x6 grid. This suggests the output grid's dimensions are double the input grid's dimensions.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid appears to be composed of four distinct 3x3 blocks arranged in a 2x2 pattern.\n3.  **Relationship between Input and Output Blocks:**\n    *   The top-left block (quadrant) of the output grid is identical to the input grid.\n    *   The top-right block seems to be a horizontal reflection (mirror image) of the input grid.\n    *   The bottom-left block seems to be a vertical reflection (upside-down image) of the input grid.\n    *   The bottom-right block seems to be both a horizontal and vertical reflection (or a 180-degree rotation) of the input grid.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves reflecting the input grid horizontally, vertically, and both, then tiling these four versions (original, horizontal flip, vertical flip, combined flip) to form the larger output grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Create three transformed grids based on `I`:\n    a.  `I_hflip`: Flip `I` horizontally.\n    b.  `I_vflip`: Flip `I` vertically.\n    c.  `I_vhflip`: Flip `I` both horizontally and vertically (equivalent to flipping `I_hflip` vertically or `I_vflip` horizontally).\n3.  Create a new output grid `O` with dimensions `2*H` by `2*W`.\n4.  Construct the output grid `O` by placing the grids as follows:\n    a.  Place `I` in the top-left quadrant of `O` (rows 0 to `H-1`, columns 0 to `W-1`).\n    b.  Place `I_hflip` in the top-right quadrant of `O` (rows 0 to `H-1`, columns `W` to `2*W-1`).\n    c.  Place `I_vflip` in the bottom-left quadrant of `O` (rows `H` to `2*H-1`, columns 0 to `W-1`).\n    d.  Place `I_vhflip` in the bottom-right quadrant of `O` (rows `H` to `2*H-1`, columns `W` to `2*W-1`).\n5.  Return the final output grid `O`."
