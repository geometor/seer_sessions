task_description: Create a larger grid by tiling the input grid and its reflections.
grid_properties:
  - input_grid:
      attributes: [height H, width W]
  - output_grid:
      attributes: [height 2*H, width 2*W]
composition:
  - output_grid: composed of four quadrants, each of size H x W.
quadrants:
  - top_left:
      relation: identical to input_grid
      position: rows 0 to H-1, cols 0 to W-1
  - top_right:
      relation: horizontal flip of input_grid
      position: rows 0 to H-1, cols W to 2*W-1
  - bottom_left:
      relation: vertical flip of input_grid
      position: rows H to 2*H-1, cols 0 to W-1
  - bottom_right:
      relation: horizontal and vertical flip of input_grid
      position: rows H to 2*H-1, cols W to 2*W-1
actions:
  - flip_horizontal: Reverse the order of columns in the grid.
  - flip_vertical: Reverse the order of rows in the grid.
  - tile: Arrange grids adjacent to each other to form a larger grid.
