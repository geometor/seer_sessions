Results for code_00.py:
Train Set Error: syntax error:
unexpected indent (<unknown>, line 106)
**General Assessment**

The primary issue is a `SyntaxError: unexpected indent` within the provided Python code. This prevents the code from being executed and tested against the examples. The error originates in the `except ValueError:` block, specifically around lines 98, 105, and 106, where indentation levels are inconsistent.

The strategy is to:
1.  Identify and correct the indentation errors in the Python code.
2.  Re-evaluate the intended logic described by the code (extracting row signatures, filtering consecutive duplicates) against the task examples once the code is runnable.
3.  For now, proceed with analyzing the *intended* logic based on the provided code structure and comments, assuming this logic was derived from earlier observations.

**Metrics and Analysis**

Since the code failed due to a syntax error, execution metrics cannot be gathered directly from the test runs. However, we can simulate the intended logic on a hypothetical example to understand the process and relevant metrics.

Let's define a hypothetical input grid and apply the logic described in the `transform` function:

Input Grid:

```
[[1, 1, 2, 2, 1],  # Blue, Blue, Red, Red, Blue
 [1, 1, 2, 2, 1],  # Blue, Blue, Red, Red, Blue
 [3, 3, 3, 1, 1],  # Green, Green, Green, Blue, Blue
 [4, 4, 4, 4, 4],  # Yellow, Yellow, Yellow, Yellow, Yellow
 [4, 4, 4, 4, 4],  # Yellow, Yellow, Yellow, Yellow, Yellow
 [1, 2, 3, 1, 2]]  # Blue, Red, Green, Blue, Red
```

**Observations from Simulation:**

*   **Input:** A grid of pixels (colors).
*   **Intermediate Object:** "Row Signature" - a sequence representing the unique colors in a row, ordered by their first appearance from left to right.
*   **Action 1:** Generate the Row Signature for each row of the input grid.
*   **Action 2:** Collect these signatures in order, forming a list of signatures.
*   **Action 3:** Filter this list, removing any signature that is identical to the one immediately preceding it.
*   **Output:** A new grid formed by vertically stacking the filtered signatures. The width of the output grid is determined by the maximum length among the filtered signatures, and shorter rows might need padding (though the current code returns a list of lists if widths differ, avoiding explicit padding). The number of rows in the output is the number of signatures remaining after filtering.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
Input:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - rows: List of lists of pixels (colors)
      - height: Integer > 0
      - width: Integer > 0

IntermediateObjects:
  - type: RowSignature
    properties:
      - sequence: List of colors (integers 0-9)
      - uniqueness: Contains each color present in the original row exactly once
      - order: Determined by the first appearance of each color from left-to-right in the original row
  - type: ListOfSignatures
    properties:
      - sequence: List of RowSignatures, one for each row of the input grid, maintaining original row order

Actions:
  - name: GenerateRowSignature
    input: Grid Row (List of colors)
    output: RowSignature
    description: Iterates through the row left-to-right, adding a color to the signature only if it hasn't been seen before in that row.
  - name: FilterConsecutiveDuplicates
    input: ListOfSignatures
    output: FilteredListOfSignatures (List of RowSignatures)
    description: Iterates through the ListOfSignatures, keeping only those signatures that are different from the immediately preceding one. The first signature is always kept.
  - name: ConstructOutputGrid
    input: FilteredListOfSignatures
    output: Grid
    description: Vertically stacks the RowSignatures from the FilteredListOfSignatures to form the output grid. Rows may have variable lengths.

Output:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - rows: List of lists of pixels (colors), corresponding to the filtered RowSignatures.
      - height: Number of signatures remaining after filtering.
      - width: Variable, determined by the length of each filtered signature. (If forced rectangular, width is max length, and padding needed).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Examine the input grid row by row, from top to bottom.
2.  For each row, determine its "signature": Create a sequence containing the unique colors present in that row, ordered according to their first appearance from left to right.
3.  Collect these row signatures into a list, maintaining the top-to-bottom order.
4.  Process the list of signatures: Initialize a new list with the first signature. Iterate through the remaining signatures, adding a signature to the new list only if it is different from the last signature added.
5.  Construct the output grid by vertically stacking the sequences (rows) from the filtered list of signatures. The resulting grid's rows correspond to these filtered signatures.
