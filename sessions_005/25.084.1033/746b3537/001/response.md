"""
Transforms an input grid by first processing each row to find the sequence of unique colors in their order of first appearance (row signature). Then, it filters this sequence of row signatures, removing any signature that is identical to the immediately preceding one. The final output grid is constructed by stacking the remaining unique consecutive signatures vertically.
