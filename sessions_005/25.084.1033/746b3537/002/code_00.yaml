Input:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - rows: List of lists of pixels (colors)
      - height: Integer > 0
      - width: Integer > 0

IntermediateObjects:
  - type: RowSignature
    properties:
      - sequence: List of colors (integers 0-9)
      - uniqueness: Contains each color present in the original row exactly once
      - order: Determined by the first appearance of each color from left-to-right in the original row
  - type: ListOfSignatures
    properties:
      - sequence: List of RowSignatures, one for each row of the input grid, maintaining original row order

Actions:
  - name: GenerateRowSignature
    input: Grid Row (List of colors)
    output: RowSignature
    description: Iterates through the row left-to-right, adding a color to the signature only if it hasn't been seen before in that row.
  - name: FilterConsecutiveDuplicates
    input: ListOfSignatures
    output: FilteredListOfSignatures (List of RowSignatures)
    description: Iterates through the ListOfSignatures, keeping only those signatures that are different from the immediately preceding one. The first signature is always kept.
  - name: ConstructOutputGrid
    input: FilteredListOfSignatures
    output: Grid
    description: Vertically stacks the RowSignatures from the FilteredListOfSignatures to form the output grid. Rows may have variable lengths.

Output:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - rows: List of lists of pixels (colors), corresponding to the filtered RowSignatures.
      - height: Number of signatures remaining after filtering.
      - width: Variable, determined by the length of each filtered signature. (If forced rectangular, width is max length, and padding needed).
