This prevents the code from being executed and tested against the examples. The error originates in the `except ValueError:` block, specifically around lines 98, 105, and 106, where indentation levels are inconsistent.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Identify and correct the indentation errors in the Python code.\n2.  Re-evaluate the intended logic described by the code (extracting row signatures, filtering consecutive duplicates) against the task examples once the code is runnable.\n3.  For now, proceed with analyzing the *intended* logic based on the provided code structure and comments, assuming this logic was derived from earlier observations.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nSince the code failed due to a syntax error, execution metrics cannot be gathered directly from the test runs. However, we can simulate the intended logic on a hypothetical example to understand the process and relevant metrics.\n\nLet's define a hypothetical input grid and apply the logic described in the `transform` function:\n\nInput Grid:\n"
