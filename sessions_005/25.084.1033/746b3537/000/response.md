Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are both grids of colored pixels.
The transformation appears to operate on a row-by-row basis.
In each input row, duplicate colors are removed while preserving the order of the first appearance of each unique color. This creates a "processed row" or "signature" for each original row.
After processing all input rows, consecutive identical signatures are collapsed into a single instance.
The final output grid is formed by stacking the resulting unique consecutive signatures vertically. The width of the output grid is determined by the maximum length of these final signatures.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: input_grid
    attributes:
      - type: 2D array of integers (colors)
      - rows represent horizontal sequences of pixels
  - item: output_grid
    attributes:
      - type: 2D array of integers (colors)
      - derived from input_grid
transformation_steps:
  - step: row_processing
    action: Iterate through each row of the input grid.
    input: input row
    output: row_signature
    details:
      - For each row, identify the unique colors present.
      - Preserve the order of the first appearance of each unique color.
      - Example: [2, 3, 3, 8, 1] becomes [2, 3, 8, 1].
      - Example: [4, 4, 4, 4] becomes [4].
  - step: signature_collection
    action: Collect the signatures generated from each input row in order.
    input: list of row_signatures
    output: ordered list of signatures
  - step: consecutive_duplicate_filtering
    action: Filter the ordered list of signatures to remove consecutive duplicates.
    input: ordered list of signatures
    output: filtered list of signatures
    details:
      - Iterate through the list. If a signature is identical to the previous one, discard it. Keep the first occurrence in any consecutive sequence.
      - Example: `[[2], [6], [8], [8]]` becomes `[[2], [6], [8]]`.
      - Example: `[[1], [2], [1]]` remains `[[1], [2], [1]]`.
      - Example: `[[4], [4], [2], [2], [8], [3]]` becomes `[[4], [2], [8], [3]]`.
  - step: output_construction
    action: Stack the filtered list of signatures vertically to form the output grid.
    input: filtered list of signatures
    output: output_grid
    details:
      - Each signature in the filtered list becomes a row in the output grid.
      - The height of the output grid is the number of signatures in the filtered list.
      - The width of the output grid is determined by the length of the longest signature in the filtered list (though in these examples, all signatures destined for the output have consistent lengths within each example).
relationships:
  - type: row_correspondence
    description: Each row in the intermediate processed list corresponds to a row in the input grid.
  - type: order_preservation
    description: The relative order of input rows influences the order of processed signatures before filtering. The order of unique colors within a row is preserved.
  - type: identity_comparison
    description: Comparison is performed between processed row signatures to identify duplicates for filtering.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty list called `processed_rows`.
2.  For each `input_row` in the `input_grid` (from top to bottom):
    a.  Initialize an empty list called `current_signature`.
    b.  Initialize an empty set called `seen_colors`.
    c.  For each `color` in the `input_row` (from left to right):
        i.  If the `color` is not in `seen_colors`:
            1.  Add the `color` to `seen_colors`.
            2.  Append the `color` to `current_signature`.
    d.  Append `current_signature` to the `processed_rows` list.
3.  Initialize an empty list called `final_rows`.
4.  If `processed_rows` is not empty:
    a.  Add the first element of `processed_rows` to `final_rows`.
    b.  Iterate through `processed_rows` starting from the second element (`index` 1 to end).
    c.  Let `current_processed_row` be the element at the current `index`.
    d.  Let `previous_final_row` be the last element currently in `final_rows`.
    e.  If `current_processed_row` is not identical to `previous_final_row`:
        i.  Append `current_processed_row` to `final_rows`.
5.  Construct the `output_grid` using the lists contained within `final_rows` as the grid rows.
