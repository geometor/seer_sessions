This creates a \"processed row\" or \"signature\" for each original row.\nAfter processing all input rows, consecutive identical signatures are collapsed into a single instance.\nThe final output grid is formed by stacking the resulting unique consecutive signatures vertically. The width of the output grid is determined by the maximum length of these final signatures.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
