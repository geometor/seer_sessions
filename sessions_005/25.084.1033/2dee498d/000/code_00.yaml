task_name: Horizontal Repetition Extraction
description: Extracts the leftmost repeating unit from an input grid formed by horizontally repeating that unit three times.
observations:
  - property: input_grid_structure
    value: Composed of a smaller pattern repeated horizontally 3 times.
  - property: output_grid_derivation
    value: The leftmost segment of the input grid.
  - relationship: dimensions
    input_height: H
    input_width: W
    output_height: H
    output_width: W / 3
  - constraint: input_width_divisible_by_3
    value: True
  - invariant: grid_height
    value: Remains the same between input and output.
  - action: extraction
    target: Leftmost columns
    count: Input width divided by 3
