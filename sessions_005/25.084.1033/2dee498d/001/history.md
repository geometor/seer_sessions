**Perception:**

The input grids in all examples appear to be composed of a smaller pattern that is repeated horizontally exactly three times. The output grid in each case is identical to this smaller, repeating pattern. The height of the grid remains unchanged from input to output, while the width of the output grid is exactly one-third of the width of the input grid. The transformation extracts the leftmost one-third of the input grid to produce the output.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_name: Horizontal Repetition Extraction
description: Extracts the leftmost repeating unit from an input grid formed by horizontally repeating that unit three times.
observations:
  - property: input_grid_structure
    value: Composed of a smaller pattern repeated horizontally 3 times.
  - property: output_grid_derivation
    value: The leftmost segment of the input grid.
  - relationship: dimensions
    input_height: H
    input_width: W
    output_height: H
    output_width: W / 3
  - constraint: input_width_divisible_by_3
    value: True
  - invariant: grid_height
    value: Remains the same between input and output.
  - action: extraction
    target: Leftmost columns
    count: Input width divided by 3
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Calculate the width of the output grid by dividing the input grid's width (W) by 3. Let this be `output_width`.
3.  Create a new grid with height H and width `output_width`.
4.  Copy the pixel values from the leftmost `output_width` columns of the input grid into the new grid, maintaining their row and column positions relative to the top-left corner.
5.  The resulting new grid is the output.
