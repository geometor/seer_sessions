Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The inputs are 5x5 grids, while the outputs are always 2x2 grids.
2.  **Colors:** The colors used in the output grid are always present in the input grid. No new colors are introduced. The specific non-zero color varies between examples (blue, red, azure).
3.  **Separator:** Each input grid features a single horizontal row composed entirely of white pixels (0). This row acts as a separator, dividing the grid into an upper section and a lower section. In all examples, this separator is the 3rd row (index 2).
4.  **Key Regions:** The structure suggests focusing on the 2x2 corner regions relative to the separator and the grid boundaries. There are four such primary 2x2 regions:
    *   Top-left corner of the upper section.
    *   Top-right corner of the upper section.
    *   Top-left corner of the lower section (immediately below the separator).
    *   Top-right corner of the lower section (immediately below the separator).
5.  **Transformation Logic:** Observing the examples, the output 2x2 grid consistently matches *exactly one* of these four key 2x2 regions from the input. The crucial step is identifying *which* of the four regions is selected.
6.  **Uniqueness Pattern:** By comparing the four key 2x2 regions within each input grid, a pattern emerges: three of the regions are identical to each other, and one region is different (unique). The unique 2x2 region corresponds to the output grid in all examples.
    *   Example 1: The bottom-left region below the separator (`[[1, 0], [1, 1]]`) is unique; the other three are `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`. The output matches the unique region.
    *   Example 2: The bottom-right region below the separator (`[[2, 2], [2, 0]]`) is unique; the other three are `[[0, 2], [2, 2]]`. The output matches the unique region.
    *   Example 3: The top-right region above the separator (`[[0, 8], [8, 0]]`) is unique; the other three are `[[8, 8], [8, 0]]`. The output matches the unique region.

**Facts**


```yaml
Grid Properties:
  - Input grids are 5x5.
  - Output grids are 2x2.
  - Grids contain white pixels (0) and one other non-zero color per example.

Objects:
  - name: Separator
    type: Horizontal Line
    properties:
      - Consists entirely of white pixels (0).
      - Spans the full width of the grid.
      - Located at row index 2 in the examples.
      - Divides the grid into an 'upper' section (rows above) and a 'lower' section (rows below).
  - name: Candidate Blocks
    type: List of four 2x2 Grids
    description: Specific 2x2 subgrids extracted from the input based on the separator and grid corners.
    elements:
      - name: Above-Top-Left (ATL)
        location: Input rows 0-1, columns 0-1.
      - name: Above-Top-Right (ATR)
        location: Input rows 0-1, columns (width-2) to (width-1).
      - name: Below-Top-Left (BTL)
        location: Input rows (separator_row+1) to (separator_row+2), columns 0-1.
      - name: Below-Top-Right (BTR)
        location: Input rows (separator_row+1) to (separator_row+2), columns (width-2) to (width-1).

Relationships:
  - Among the four 'Candidate Blocks', three are identical in pixel values and arrangement.
  - One 'Candidate Block' is unique (different from the other three).

Action:
  - Identify the horizontal 'Separator' row.
  - Extract the four 'Candidate Blocks' (ATL, ATR, BTL, BTR).
  - Compare the four 'Candidate Blocks' to find the unique one.
  - The unique 'Candidate Block' becomes the output grid.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Locate the horizontal row in the input grid that consists entirely of white pixels (0). This is the separator row.
2.  Identify the width (`W`) of the input grid.
3.  Define four candidate 2x2 blocks based on their position relative to the separator row and the grid edges:
    a.  `Above-Top-Left (ATL)`: The 2x2 block at the top-left corner of the input grid (rows 0 to 1, columns 0 to 1).
    b.  `Above-Top-Right (ATR)`: The 2x2 block at the top-right corner of the input grid (rows 0 to 1, columns `W-2` to `W-1`).
    c.  `Below-Top-Left (BTL)`: The 2x2 block starting immediately below the separator row at the left edge (rows `separator_row_index + 1` to `separator_row_index + 2`, columns 0 to 1).
    d.  `Below-Top-Right (BTR)`: The 2x2 block starting immediately below the separator row at the right edge (rows `separator_row_index + 1` to `separator_row_index + 2`, columns `W-2` to `W-1
