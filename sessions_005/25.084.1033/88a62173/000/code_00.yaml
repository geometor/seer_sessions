Grid Properties:
  - Input grids are 5x5.
  - Output grids are 2x2.
  - Grids contain white pixels (0) and one other non-zero color per example.

Objects:
  - name: Separator
    type: Horizontal Line
    properties:
      - Consists entirely of white pixels (0).
      - Spans the full width of the grid.
      - Located at row index 2 in the examples.
      - Divides the grid into an 'upper' section (rows above) and a 'lower' section (rows below).
  - name: Candidate Blocks
    type: List of four 2x2 Grids
    description: Specific 2x2 subgrids extracted from the input based on the separator and grid corners.
    elements:
      - name: Above-Top-Left (ATL)
        location: Input rows 0-1, columns 0-1.
      - name: Above-Top-Right (ATR)
        location: Input rows 0-1, columns (width-2) to (width-1).
      - name: Below-Top-Left (BTL)
        location: Input rows (separator_row+1) to (separator_row+2), columns 0-1.
      - name: Below-Top-Right (BTR)
        location: Input rows (separator_row+1) to (separator_row+2), columns (width-2) to (width-1).

Relationships:
  - Among the four 'Candidate Blocks', three are identical in pixel values and arrangement.
  - One 'Candidate Block' is unique (different from the other three).

Action:
  - Identify the horizontal 'Separator' row.
  - Extract the four 'Candidate Blocks' (ATL, ATR, BTL, BTR).
  - Compare the four 'Candidate Blocks' to find the unique one.
  - The unique 'Candidate Block' becomes the output grid.
