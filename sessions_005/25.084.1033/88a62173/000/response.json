            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The inputs are 5x5 grids, while the outputs are always 2x2 grids.\n2.  **Colors:** The colors used in the output grid are always present in the input grid. No new colors are introduced. The specific non-zero color varies between examples (blue, red, azure).\n3.  **Separator:** Each input grid features a single horizontal row composed entirely of white pixels (0). This row acts as a separator, dividing the grid into an upper section and a lower section. In all examples, this separator is the 3rd row (index 2).\n4.  **Key Regions:** The structure suggests focusing on the 2x2 corner regions relative to the separator and the grid boundaries. There are four such primary 2x2 regions:\n    *   Top-left corner of the upper section.\n    *   Top-right corner of the upper section.\n    *   Top-left corner of the lower section (immediately below the separator).\n    *   Top-right corner of the lower section (immediately below the separator).\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** Observing the examples, the output 2x2 grid consistently matches *exactly one* of these four key 2x2 regions from the input. The crucial step is identifying *which* of the four regions is selected.\n6.  **Uniqueness Pattern:** By comparing the four key 2x2 regions within each input grid, a pattern emerges: three of the regions are identical to each other, and one region is different (unique). The unique 2x2 region corresponds to the output grid in all examples.\n    *   Example 1: The bottom-left region below the separator (`[[1, 0], [1, 1]]`) is unique; the other three are `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`. The output matches the unique region.\n    *   Example 2: The bottom-right region below the separator (`[[2, 2], [2, 0]]`) is unique; the other three are `[[0, 2], [2, 2]]`. The output matches the unique region.\n    *   Example 3: The top-right region above the separator (`[[0, 8], [8, 0]]`) is unique; the other three are `[[8, 8], [8, 0]]`. The output matches the unique region.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
