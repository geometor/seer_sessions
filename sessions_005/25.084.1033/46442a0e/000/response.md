**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Size:** The output grid is always twice the height and twice the width of the input grid. If the input is HxW, the output is 2Hx2W.
2.  **Grid Structure:** The output grid can be conceptually divided into four quadrants, each having the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  **Transformation:** Each quadrant of the output grid is a rotated version of the entire input grid.
