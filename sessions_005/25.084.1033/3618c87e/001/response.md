Transformation Rule:
1. Iterate through each column of the input grid.
2. Identify columns containing a blue pixel (1) positioned directly above a gray pixel (5).
3. For each identified column:
   a. Change the original blue pixel to white (0) in the output grid.
   b. Change the pixel in the bottom-most row of that same column to blue (1) in the output grid.
4. All other pixels retain their original colors from the input grid.
