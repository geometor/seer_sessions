*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids consistently feature blue pixels positioned directly above gray pixels.
    *   The bottom row of each input grid is entirely composed of gray pixels.
    *   The transformation involves a change in color for specific pixels based on their vertical alignment and initial color.
    *   Specifically, the original blue pixels turn white in the output.
    *   The gray pixels directly beneath the original blue pixels remain unchanged.
    *   The gray pixels in the bottom row that share the same column as the original blue pixels turn blue in the output.
    *   All other pixels, including the remaining gray pixels in the bottom row and the background white pixels, remain unchanged.
    *   This suggests a "transfer" or "projection" of the blue color downwards from its initial position to the bottom row, contingent on the presence of an intermediate gray pixel and a gray target pixel in the bottom row.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: color_transformation
    grid_size: consistent (5x5 in examples)
    objects:
      - object: blue_pixel
        properties:
          - color: blue (1)
          - location: variable row (row 2 in examples), variable column
      - object: gray_pixel_below
        properties:
          - color: gray (5)
          - location: row directly below blue_pixel, same column
      - object: bottom_row_pixel
        properties:
          - color: gray (5) initially
          - location: bottom row, variable column
    relationships:
      - type: vertical_alignment
        entities: [blue_pixel, gray_pixel_below, bottom_row_pixel]
        details: All three pixels are in the same column. blue_pixel is above gray_pixel_below, which is above bottom_row_pixel (though not necessarily directly above).
    actions:
      - action: change_color
        target: blue_pixel
        condition: Always occurs if the blue_pixel exists with a gray_pixel_below it.
        result: color changes from blue (1) to white (0).
      - action: change_color
        target: bottom_row_pixel
        condition: Must be vertically aligned (same column) with a blue_pixel and gray_pixel_below configuration higher up in the grid.
        result: color changes from gray (5) to blue (1).
      - action: no_change
        target: gray_pixel_below
        result: color remains gray (5).
      - action: no_change
        target: other pixels (white background, other gray pixels in bottom row)
        result: color remains unchanged.

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    2.  Iterate through each column of the input grid.
    3.  Within each column, search for a blue pixel (color 1) that has a gray pixel (color 5) directly below it in the next row.
    4.  If such a pair (blue pixel above a gray pixel) is found in a specific column `c` at rows `r` (blue) and `r+1` (gray):
        a.  Change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to white (0).
        b.  Locate the pixel in the bottom-most row of the same column `c`.
        c.  Change the color of this bottom-row pixel at `(last_row, c)` in the output grid to blue (1).
    5.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid unchanged from their corresponding input grid values.
    6.  Return the modified output grid.
