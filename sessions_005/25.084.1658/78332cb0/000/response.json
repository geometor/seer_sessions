            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain distinct shapes made of various colors (blue, red, green, yellow, azure, maroon). These shapes are embedded within a background of orange (7). Crucially, the input grids are divided into sections by lines (either full rows or full columns) of magenta (6) pixels.\n2.  **Separators:** The magenta (6) pixels consistently act as separators, partitioning the grid. These separators can be horizontal rows, vertical columns, or both.\n3.  **Subgrids/Objects:** The separators define rectangular subgrids. Each subgrid contains one of the distinct colored shapes surrounded by the orange background. In the examples provided, these subgrids appear to be consistently 5x5 in size.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves:\n    *   Identifying the magenta separators.\n    *   Extracting the subgrids defined by these separators (excluding the separators themselves).\n    *   Rearranging these extracted subgrids into a new output grid.\n    *   Inserting magenta separators between the rearranged subgrids.\n5.  **Rearrangement Logic:** The way the subgrids are rearranged and the orientation of the new separators depend on the orientation of the separators in the input grid:\n    *   **Horizontal Input Separators Only (Train 2):** The subgrids (originally stacked vertically) are concatenated horizontally in the output, separated by vertical magenta lines. The order of concatenation is the reverse of their original vertical order (bottom-to-top).\n    *   **Vertical Input Separators Only (Train 3):** The subgrids (originally arranged horizontally) are stacked vertically in the output, separated by horizontal magenta lines. The order of stacking matches their original horizontal order (left-to-right).\n    *   **Both Horizontal and Vertical Input Separators (Train 1):** The input grid is divided into a 2x2 arrangement of subgrids. These are stacked vertically in the output, separated by horizontal magenta lines. The specific stacking order observed is: Top-Left, Bottom-Right, Top-Right, Bottom-Left.\n6.  **Output Grid Construction:** The final output grid is built by assembling the ordered subgrids with the appropriate magenta separators (single row or single column) between them.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
