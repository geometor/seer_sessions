description: Construct an output grid by arranging specific colors found in the input into a predefined pattern based on the set of colors present.

examples:
  example1:
    input:
      dimensions: [13, 13]
      background_color: 8 (azure)
      foreground_colors: [1 (blue), 3 (green), 4 (yellow), 6 (magenta)]
      # Note: Input contains multiple distinct objects of these colors.
    output:
      dimensions: [5, 5]
      background_color: 3 (green) # Based on frequency in output
      present_colors: [1 (blue), 3 (green), 4 (yellow), 6 (magenta)]
      structure:
        - Green (3) forms a frame/border, mostly filling the grid.
        - Blue (1) forms a 2x3 rectangle in the center.
        - Magenta (6) forms a 2x1 vertical line within the green frame.
        - Yellow (4) appears at specific points, potentially corners relative to the inner shapes.
  example2:
    input:
      dimensions: [13, 13]
      background_color: 3 (green)
      foreground_colors: [1 (blue), 2 (red), 4 (yellow), 5 (gray), 6 (magenta), 8 (azure)]
      # Note: Input contains multiple distinct objects of these colors.
    output:
      dimensions: [8, 5]
      background_color: 1 (blue) # Based on frequency in output
      present_colors: [1 (blue), 2 (red), 4 (yellow), 5 (gray), 6 (magenta), 8 (azure)]
      structure:
        - Gray (5) forms the four corners.
        - Magenta (6) forms vertical lines/borders on the sides.
        - Blue (1) forms an inner border or frame.
        - Azure (8), Red (2), Yellow (4) form a complex pattern in the center.

observations:
  - The transformation does not simply extract a subgrid or a single object.
  - The output grid is constructed.
  - The background color of the input is discarded.
  - All non-background colors present in the input appear in the output.
  - The dimensions and pattern of the output grid depend on the specific set of non-background colors found in the input.
  - Each non-background color seems to have a designated role or position within the output pattern for a given set of colors.
  - The shape or count of the input objects of a specific color does not seem directly relevant, only the presence of the color itself.
