## General Assessment

The initial hypothesis, "Find the object with the most unique colors and extract its bounding box," was incorrect. The transformed outputs generated by the previous code differ significantly from the expected outputs in terms of size, content, and structure for both examples provided.

*   **Example 1 Failure:** The code extracted a single yellow pixel, mistaking it for the target based on faulty logic (likely picking the first object encountered when multiple had the same maximum color diversity of 1). The expected output is a larger, structured grid composed of multiple colors found in the input.
*   **Example 2 Failure:** The code extracted a small portion of the input grid, again failing to capture the structure and complete set of colors present in the expected output. The expected output is significantly larger and arranges colors in a specific pattern not present as a single contiguous block in the input.

The new strategy should focus on:
1.  Identifying the background color.
2.  Identifying *all* unique non-background colors present in the input grid.
3.  Observing that the output grid's structure and content seem determined by the *set* of non-background colors found. Each color appears to play a specific role (e.g., border, corner, center) in constructing the output.
4.  Deriving the rules for constructing the output grid based on the identified colors and their assigned roles.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's analyze the grids to confirm background colors and the unique non-background colors present in each example.

## Facts


```yaml
task_name: 05f2a901
description: Construct an output grid by arranging specific colors found in the input into a predefined pattern based on the set of colors present.

examples:
  example1:
    input:
      dimensions: [13, 13]
      background_color: 8 (azure)
      foreground_colors: [1 (blue), 3 (green), 4 (yellow), 6 (magenta)]
      # Note: Input contains multiple distinct objects of these colors.
    output:
      dimensions: [5, 5]
      background_color: 3 (green) # Based on frequency in output
      present_colors: [1 (blue), 3 (green), 4 (yellow), 6 (magenta)]
      structure:
        - Green (3) forms a frame/border, mostly filling the grid.
        - Blue (1) forms a 2x3 rectangle in the center.
        - Magenta (6) forms a 2x1 vertical line within the green frame.
        - Yellow (4) appears at specific points, potentially corners relative to the inner shapes.
  example2:
    input:
      dimensions: [13, 13]
      background_color: 3 (green)
      foreground_colors: [1 (blue), 2 (red), 4 (yellow), 5 (gray), 6 (magenta), 8 (azure)]
      # Note: Input contains multiple distinct objects of these colors.
    output:
      dimensions: [8, 5]
      background_color: 1 (blue) # Based on frequency in output
      present_colors: [1 (blue), 2 (red), 4 (yellow), 5 (gray), 6 (magenta), 8 (azure)]
      structure:
        - Gray (5) forms the four corners.
        - Magenta (6) forms vertical lines/borders on the sides.
        - Blue (1) forms an inner border or frame.
        - Azure (8), Red (2), Yellow (4) form a complex pattern in the center.

observations:
  - The transformation does not simply extract a subgrid or a single object.
  - The output grid is constructed.
  - The background color of the input is discarded.
  - All non-background colors present in the input appear in the output.
  - The dimensions and pattern of the output grid depend on the specific set of non-background colors found in the input.
  - Each non-background color seems to have a designated role or position within the output pattern for a given set of colors.
  - The shape or count of the input objects of a specific color does not seem directly relevant, only the presence of the color itself.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the background color of the input grid (the most frequent color).
2.  Identify the set of all unique non-background colors present in the input grid.
3.  Determine the dimensions and structure (template) of the output grid based *uniquely* on the specific *combination* of non-background colors found in step 2.
    *   If the non-background colors are {Blue (1), Green (3), Yellow (4), Magenta (6)}, the output grid is 5x5.
    *   If the non-background colors are {Blue (1), Red (2), Yellow (4), Gray (5), Magenta (6), Azure (8)}, the output grid is 8x5.
    *   *(Generalize: There is likely a mapping from the set of unique non-background colors to specific output dimensions and a corresponding template/pattern.)*
4.  Construct the output grid by filling the determined template according to the roles assigned to each color for that specific template:
    *   For the {1, 3, 4, 6} case (5x5 output):
        *   Fill most of the grid with Green (3) to form a base/frame.
        *   Place a 2x3 Blue (1) rectangle centrally.
        *   Place a 2x1 Magenta (6) line centrally below the Blue rectangle.
        *   Place Yellow (4) pixels at specific coordinates relative to the structure (e.g., (0,2), (3,0), (3,4)).
    *   For the {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8} case (8x5 output):
        *   Place Gray (5) at the four corner cells.
        *   Place Magenta (6) along the vertical edges (excluding corners).
        *   Place Blue (1) forming an inner frame adjacent to the Gray/Magenta border.
        *   Fill the remaining central area with a specific pattern using Azure (8), Red (2), and Yellow (4).
    *   *(Generalize: Each unique set of input foreground colors maps to a fixed output pattern where each color has a predefined position or role.)*
5.  Return the fully constructed output grid.
