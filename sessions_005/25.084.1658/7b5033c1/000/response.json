The output is a 1D grid (a single column) of colors.\n2.  **Background Color:** In each input grid, there appears to be a dominant background color (azure '8' in train\\_1, blue '1' in train\\_2).\n3.  **Foreground Objects:** The input grids contain distinct shapes or \"objects\" composed of colors different from the background. These objects are contiguous blocks of the same color.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to extract the colors of the pixels belonging to these foreground objects and arrange them into a single column.\n5.  **Pixel Count:** The number of times each color appears in the output column corresponds exactly to the number of pixels of that color present in the foreground objects in the input grid.\n6.  **Ordering:** The colors in the output column are grouped by object. The order of these groups corresponds to the order of the objects in the input grid, seemingly determined by their vertical position (top-to-bottom). If objects start on the same row, the left-most one comes first.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
