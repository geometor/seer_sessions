task_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: height and width (constant between input and output)
      - cells: pixels with color values (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value 0-9
      - position: row and column index
      - role:
        - background: white (0)
        - fill_color: blue (1)
        - boundary_color: any non-white color (1-9)

transformation:
  - type: color_change
    input_color: white (0)
    output_color: blue (1)
    condition:
      - type: spatial_relationship
        scope: horizontal (within the same row)
        description: >
          A pixel changes color if it is white (0) AND it belongs to a
          contiguous horizontal sequence of one or more white (0) pixels
          that is immediately bounded on the left by a non-white (1-9) pixel
          AND immediately bounded on the right by a non-white (1-9) pixel.
      - type: completeness
        description: All pixels within the identified white sequence are changed.

invariance:
  - type: pixel_color
    description: >
      Pixels that are not white (0) in the input remain unchanged in the output.
  - type: pixel_color
    description: >
      White (0) pixels that do not meet the boundary condition remain unchanged.
  - type: grid_property
    description: Grid dimensions remain unchanged.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    direction: horizontal (left and right neighbors in the same row)
    relevance: >
      Crucial for determining which white (0) pixels are transformed.
      Only immediate left/right neighbors of a white segment matter.
