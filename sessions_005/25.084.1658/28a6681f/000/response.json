            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on grids of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions in all examples.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved are `white` (0), `blue` (1), `red` (2), `green` (3), `yellow` (4), `gray` (5), `maroon` (9). Notably, `blue` (1) is the color used for the transformation output, while `white` (0) is the color being transformed. Other colors act as context or boundaries.\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation involves changing specific `white` (0) pixels to `blue` (1). All other pixels retain their original color from the input.\n4.  **Spatial Relationship:** The change from `white` to `blue` depends on the horizontal neighbors of the `white` pixels. Specifically, `white` pixels that are horizontally \"sandwiched\" between non-`white` pixels within the same row are affected.\n5.  **Horizontal Gaps:** The transformation identifies horizontal sequences (segments) of one or more `white` pixels. If such a sequence has a non-`white` pixel immediately to its left and a non-`white` pixel immediately to its right (both within the same row), the entire sequence of `white` pixels is filled with `blue` (1).\n6.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds across all three training examples. The specific colors of the bounding non-`white` pixels do not matter, only that they are not `white` (0). The length of the `white` segment can be one or more pixels.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
