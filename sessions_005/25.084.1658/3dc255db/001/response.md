"""
Transforms the input grid by removing pixels of specific 'target' colors 
(Magenta=6, Orange=7, Maroon=9) if they are adjacent (8-way connectivity, 
including diagonals) to specific 'trigger' colors in the input grid.

The removal rules are:
- Magenta(6) is removed if adjacent to Yellow(4).
- Orange(7) is removed if adjacent to Green(3) OR Magenta(6).
- Maroon(9) is removed if adjacent to Green(3) OR Magenta(6).

Pixels not meeting these removal conditions, and pixels that are not target 
colors, retain their original color. The background color (white=0) is unchanged.

Note: This implementation only addresses the pixel removal observed consistently. 
It does not account for the addition of pixels seen in the example outputs, 
as the rule for these additions is unclear or inconsistent.
