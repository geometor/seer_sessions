task_description: Modifies an input grid by removing pixels of specific 'target' colors based on the color of their adjacent neighbors ('trigger' colors). Inconsistent addition of pixels in outputs complicates the full rule.

grid_properties:
  - Grid dimensions remain constant.
  - Background color (white, 0) is unchanged.

object_types:
  - Pixels: Distinguished by color and position.
  - Groups: Contiguous areas of same-colored pixels (implicitly).

relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share an edge or corner (8-way connectivity).
  - Trigger-Target Color Pairs: Specific relationships where one color causes the removal of an adjacent color.
      - Trigger: Yellow (4), Green (3), Magenta (6)
      - Target: Magenta (6), Orange (7), Maroon (9)

actions_observed:
  - Pixel Removal: Target pixels adjacent to corresponding trigger pixels are changed to white (0).
      - Rule 1: Magenta(6) -> White(0) if adjacent to Yellow(4).
      - Rule 2: Orange(7) -> White(0) if adjacent to Green(3) OR Magenta(6).
      - Rule 3: Maroon(9) -> White(0) if adjacent to Green(3) OR Magenta(6).
  - Pixel Addition (Inconsistent/Unclear): Pixels of target colors appear in new locations in the output grids. The rule governing this addition is not evident or consistent across examples.

uncertainties:
  - The rule determining the placement and number of added pixels in the output is unclear and potentially inconsistent with the removal logic, or the examples may be flawed. The primary, consistent transformation appears to be the adjacency-based removal.
