*   **Perception:**
    *   The input is a 3x3 grid containing various colors (pixels with values 0-9).
    *   The output is also a 3x3 grid, the same dimensions as the input.
    *   The output grid is uniformly filled with a single color.
    *   The color used to fill the output grid is present in the corresponding input grid.
    *   Comparing the input colors and the output color suggests a selection process based on the frequency of colors in the input. In each example, the color that appears most often in the input grid is the color used to fill the output grid.

*   **Facts:**

    grid_properties:
      - input_grid:
          type: 2D array
          height: 3
          width: 3
          cell_values: integers 0-9 (representing colors)
          content: diverse colors

          type: 2D array
          height: 3
          width: 3
          cell_values: integers 0-9 (representing colors)
          content: uniform color
          relationship_to_input: same dimensions
    transformation_details:
      - action: analyze input grid colors
      - operation: count frequency of each color value
      - selection_criterion: identify the color with the highest frequency
      - generation: create output grid
      - population: fill the output grid entirely with the selected most frequent color
    examples_analysis:
      - example_1:
          input_colors: {6: 1, 8: 2, 9: 3, 1: 2, 4: 1}
          most_frequent: 9 (maroon)
          output_color: 9 (maroon)
      - example_2:
          input_colors: {4: 3, 8: 1, 6: 2, 3: 2, 0: 1}
          most_frequent: 4 (yellow)
          output_color: 4 (yellow)
      - example_3:
          input_colors: {4: 2, 6: 3, 9: 1, 1: 1, 8: 2}
          most_frequent: 6 (magenta)
          output_color: 6 (magenta)
    assumptions:
     - There is always a unique most frequent color in the input grid based on the provided examples.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input grid.
    2.  Determine the dimensions (height and width) of the input grid.
    3.  Identify all unique colors present in the input grid and count the number of times each color appears.
    4.  Find the color that has the highest count (the most frequent color).
    5.  Create a new grid with the same height and width as the input grid.
    6.  Fill every cell of the new grid with the most frequent color identified in step 4.
    7.  Output the newly created and filled grid.
