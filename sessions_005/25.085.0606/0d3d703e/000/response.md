*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output grids are consistently 3x3 in all examples.
    *   Within each example, all rows of the input grid are identical. Similarly, all rows of the output grid are identical.
    *   The transformation appears to be applied pixel by pixel, based solely on the color value of the input pixel. The position of the pixel within the grid does not seem to influence the transformation.
    *   Comparing corresponding pixel values between input and output grids reveals a consistent mapping pattern across all examples:
        *   Gray (5) maps to Blue (1)
        *   Azure (8) maps to Maroon (9)
        *   Magenta (6) maps to Red (2)
        *   Red (2) maps to Magenta (6)
        *   Green (3) maps to Yellow (4)
        *   Azure (8) maps to Maroon (9)
        *   Maroon (9) maps to Azure (8)
        *   Yellow (4) maps to Green (3)
        *   Red (2) maps to Magenta (6)
        *   Green (3) maps to Yellow (4)
        *   Blue (1) maps to Gray (5)
        *   Red (2) maps to Magenta (6)
    *   This suggests a fixed substitution cipher where specific pairs of colors swap places:
        *   Gray (5) <-> Blue (1)
        *   Magenta (6) <-> Red (2)
        *   Yellow (4) <-> Green (3)
        *   Maroon (9) <-> Azure (8)
    *   Colors White (0) and Orange (7) do not appear in the provided examples. The simplest assumption is that they remain unchanged if encountered.

    task_description: Apply a fixed color substitution to each pixel independently.
    grid_properties:
      - input_dimensions: 3x3 (consistent across examples)
      - output_dimensions: 3x3 (consistent across examples)
      - structure: All rows are identical within each input and output grid.

      mapping:
        1: 5  # Blue -> Gray
        2: 6  # Red -> Magenta
        3: 4  # Green -> Yellow
        4: 3  # Yellow -> Green
        5: 1  # Gray -> Blue
        6: 2  # Magenta -> Red
        8: 9  # Azure -> Maroon
        9: 8  # Maroon -> Azure
      unmapped_colors: # Colors not observed in inputs, assumed unchanged
        0: 0  # White -> White
        7: 7  # Orange -> Orange
      conditions: The substitution depends only on the input pixel's color value, not its position.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    2.  For each pixel in the input grid:
        a.  Get the color value of the input pixel.
        b.  Determine the output color value based on the following fixed substitution map:
            *   If the input color is Blue (1), the output color is Gray (5).
            *   If the input color is Gray (5), the output color is Blue (1).
            *   If the input color is Red (2), the output color is Magenta (6).
            *   If the input color is Magenta (6), the output color is Red (2).
            *   If the input color is Green (3), the output color is Yellow (4).
            *   If the input color is Yellow (4), the output color is Green (3).
            *   If the input color is Azure (8), the output color is Maroon (9).
            *   If the input color is Maroon (9), the output color is Azure (8).
            *   If the input color is White (0) or Orange (7), the output color is the same as the input color.
        c.  Set the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the determined output color value.
    3.  Return the completed output grid.
