observations:
  - task_type: grid_transformation
  - input_grid_size: always 3x3
  - output_grid_size: always 1x1
  - target_pixels: color red (2) in the input grid
  - background_pixels: color white (0) in the input grid (based on examples)
  - output_colors: blue (1) or orange (7)

analysis:
  - step: Identify all red pixels in the input grid.
  - step: Determine the number of connected components formed by these red pixels.
    - definition: Connectivity includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal adjacency.
  - step: Check for special conditions if exactly one connected component exists.
    - condition: Examine if any two red pixels within that single component are orthogonally adjacent (horizontally or vertically).
  - step: Determine the output color based on the analysis.

rules:
  - condition: If the number of red connected components is 0 or greater than 1.
    - action: The output grid is 1x1 containing blue (1).
  - condition: If the number of red connected components is exactly 1.
    - sub_condition: If there is at least one pair of orthogonally adjacent red pixels within this component.
      - action: The output grid is 1x1 containing orange (7).
    - sub_condition: If all connections within the single component are purely diagonal (no orthogonal connections exist between any pair of pixels in the component).
      - action: The output grid is 1x1 containing blue (1).

examples_summary:
  - example 1: 2 components -> output blue (1)
  - example 2: 1 component, has orthogonal connections -> output orange (7)
  - example 3: 1 component, has orthogonal connections -> output orange (7)
  - example 4: 1 component, has orthogonal connections -> output orange (7)
  - example 5: 2 components -> output blue (1)
  - example 6: 1 component, only diagonal connections -> output blue (1)
