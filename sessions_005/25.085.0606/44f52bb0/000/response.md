*   **Perception:**
    The task involves analyzing a 3x3 input grid containing white (0) and red (2) pixels and producing a single-pixel output grid. The output color is either blue (1) or orange (7). The key seems to be the spatial arrangement and connectivity of the red pixels within the input grid.

*   **Observations:**
    -   **Input:** 3x3 grids with white (0) and red (2) pixels.
    -   **Output:** 1x1 grid, either blue (1) or orange (7).
    -   **Connectivity:** The crucial factor determining the output appears to be whether all the red pixels in the input form a single connected group. Connectivity includes pixels that are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
    -   **Rule:**
        -   If all red pixels form one single connected component, the output is 7 (orange).
        -   If the red pixels form multiple separate components, or if there are no red pixels, the output is 1 (blue).

*   **YAML Facts:**

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all locations of red (2) pixels within the input grid.
    2.  If no red pixels are found, set the output to blue (1).
    3.  If red pixels are found, determine the number of distinct connected components they form. Two red pixels are considered connected if they are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
    4.  If there is exactly one connected component of red pixels, set the output to orange (7).
    5.  If there is more than one connected component of red pixels, set the output to blue (1).
    6.  Produce a 1x1 output grid containing the determined color value.
