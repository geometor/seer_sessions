"""
Determines the output color based on the connectivity of red (2) pixels in a 3x3 input grid.

1. Identify all red pixels.
2. Find the connected components of red pixels, considering horizontal, vertical, and diagonal adjacency (8-way connectivity).
3. Count the number of components.
4. If there is exactly one component:
   a. Check if any two pixels within that component are orthogonally adjacent (horizontal or vertical, 4-way connectivity).
   b. If an orthogonal connection exists, the output is orange (7).
   c. If only diagonal connections exist within the single component, the output is blue (1).
5. If there are zero red pixels or more than one component, the output is blue (1).
6. The output is always a 1x1 grid containing the determined color.
