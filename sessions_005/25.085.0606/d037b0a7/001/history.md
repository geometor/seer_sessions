Okay, let's break down the transformation process based on the provided examples.

### Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are grids of the same dimensions (3x3 in all examples).
2.  **Colors:** The grids contain various colors (Red, Orange, Azure, Magenta, Yellow, Green) against a White background (0).
3.  **Transformation Effect:** The primary transformation appears to be a "filling" or "pulling down" effect within each column. Non-White pixels seem to extend their color downwards, replacing any White pixels below them within the same column.
4.  **Stopping Condition:** This downward filling stops when it reaches the bottom of the grid or encounters another non-White pixel in the same column.
5.  **Column Independence:** The transformation in each column seems independent of the other columns.
6.  **Original Pixels:** The original non-White pixels remain in their positions in the output grid.

### Facts


```yaml
Task: Fill downwards within columns
Components:
  - Grid: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors.
  - Pixels:
      - Property: Color (0-9, where 0 is White).
      - Property: Position (row, column).
  - Columns: Vertical sequences of pixels in the grid.
Transformation:
  - Action: Color Filling Downwards
  - Rule: For each column independently:
      - Iterate through rows from top to bottom.
      - Maintain the 'current fill color', initialized to White.
      - If a non-White pixel is encountered, update the 'current fill color' to this pixel's color.
      - If a White pixel is encountered and the 'current fill color' is not White, change the White pixel's color to the 'current fill color'.
Relationship:
  - The transformation operates on each column based on the colors encountered sequentially from top to bottom within that column.
Input/Output Relationship:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Each column in the output grid is derived from the corresponding column in the input grid by applying the downward color filling rule.
```


### Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with White (0).
2.  Iterate through each column of the input grid, from left to right (column index `c` from 0 to width-1).
3.  For the current column `c`, initialize a variable `last_color` to White (0).
4.  Iterate through each row of the current column `c`, from top to bottom (row index `r` from 0 to height-1).
5.  Get the color (`input_color`) of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid.
6.  If `input_color` is not White (i.e., `input_color != 0`), update `last_color` to be `input_color`.
7.  If `last_color` is not White (i.e., `last_color != 0`), set the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to `last_color`. Otherwise (if `last_color` is still White), leave the output pixel at `(r, c)` as White (or copy the input color if it was already White, though the initial White fill handles this).
8.  After processing all rows for the current column, move to the next column.
9.  Once all columns have been processed, the new grid is the final output.
