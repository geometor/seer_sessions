Task: Fill downwards within columns
Components:
  - Grid: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors.
  - Pixels:
      - Property: Color (0-9, where 0 is White).
      - Property: Position (row, column).
  - Columns: Vertical sequences of pixels in the grid.
Transformation:
  - Action: Color Filling Downwards
  - Rule: For each column independently:
      - Iterate through rows from top to bottom.
      - Maintain the 'current fill color', initialized to White.
      - If a non-White pixel is encountered, update the 'current fill color' to this pixel's color.
      - If a White pixel is encountered and the 'current fill color' is not White, change the White pixel's color to the 'current fill color'.
Relationship:
  - The transformation operates on each column based on the colors encountered sequentially from top to bottom within that column.
Input/Output Relationship:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Each column in the output grid is derived from the corresponding column in the input grid by applying the downward color filling rule.
