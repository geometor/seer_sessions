Non-White pixels seem to extend their color downwards, replacing any White pixels below them within the same column.\n4.  **Stopping Condition:** This downward filling stops when it reaches the bottom of the grid or encounters another non-White pixel in the same column.\n5.  **Column Independence:** The transformation in each column seems independent of the other columns.\n6.  **Original Pixels:** The original non-White pixels remain in their positions in the output grid.\n\n### Facts\n\n"

Iterate through each column of the input grid, from left to right (column index `c` from 0 to width-1).\n3.  For the current column `c`, initialize a variable `last_color` to White (0).\n4.  Iterate through each row of the current column `c`, from top to bottom (row index `r` from 0 to height-1).\n5.  Get the color (`input_color`) of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid.\n6.  If `input_color` is not White (i.e., `input_color != 0`), update `last_color` to be `input_color`.\n7.  If `last_color` is not White (i.e., `last_color != 0`), set the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to `last_color`. Otherwise (if `last_color` is still White), leave the output pixel at `(r, c)` as White (or copy the input color if it was already White, though the initial White fill handles this).\n8.  After processing all rows for the current column, move to the next column.\n9.  Once all columns have been processed, the new grid is the final output."
