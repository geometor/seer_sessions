"""
Transforms a 2-row input grid based on the colors of the rows.

The input grid has two rows, each filled with a single, distinct color.
The output grid maintains the same dimensions (2 rows, same width).
The first output row alternates between the input's first row color (C1) and
second row color (C2), starting with C1.
The second output row alternates between C2 and C1, starting with C2.
