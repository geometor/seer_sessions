## Perception

The input grid consists of exactly two rows. Each row is filled entirely with a single, distinct color. The output grid has the same dimensions (height 2 and the same width as the input). The output grid uses the *same* two colors found in the input rows.

The transformation involves rearranging the colors within each row. The first row of the output alternates between the color of the input's first row (C1) and the color of the input's second row (C2), starting with C1. The second row of the output also alternates between C1 and C2, but it starts with C2.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  - description: Both input and output grids have a height of 2.
  - description: The width of the output grid is the same as the width of the input grid.
input_grid_structure:
  - type: rows
    count: 2
    properties:
      - description: The first row consists of a single color (let's call it C1).
      - description: The second row consists of a single, different color (let's call it C2).
output_grid_structure:
  - type: rows
    count: 2
    properties:
      - description: Uses only the colors C1 and C2 found in the input.
      - description: The first row is an alternating sequence of C1 and C2, starting with C1 at column index 0. The pattern is C1, C2, C1, C2, ...
      - description: The second row is an alternating sequence of C2 and C1, starting with C2 at column index 0. The pattern is C2, C1, C2, C1, ...
relationship_input_output:
  - description: The colors used in the output are directly determined by the colors of the two input rows.
  - description: The pattern in each output row depends on the original row position (first or second) of the colors in the input and the column index (even or odd).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the color of the first row in the input grid (C1).
2.  Identify the color of the second row in the input grid (C2).
3.  Determine the width (W) of the input grid.
4.  Create a new output grid with height 2 and width W.
5.  Fill the first row of the output grid: For each column index `j` from 0 to W-1, if `j` is even, place color C1; if `j` is odd, place color C2.
6.  Fill the second row of the output grid: For each column index `j` from 0 to W-1, if `j` is even, place color C2; if `j` is odd, place color C1.
7.  Return the completed output grid.
