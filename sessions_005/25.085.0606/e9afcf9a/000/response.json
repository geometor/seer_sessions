The output grid has the same dimensions (height 2 and the same width as the input). The output grid uses the *same* two colors found in the input rows.\n\nThe transformation involves rearranging the colors within each row. The first row of the output alternates between the color of the input's first row (C1) and the color of the input's second row (C2), starting with C1. The second row of the output also alternates between C1 and C2, but it starts with C2.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
