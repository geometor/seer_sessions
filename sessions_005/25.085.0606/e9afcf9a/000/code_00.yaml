task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  - description: Both input and output grids have a height of 2.
  - description: The width of the output grid is the same as the width of the input grid.
input_grid_structure:
  - type: rows
    count: 2
    properties:
      - description: The first row consists of a single color (let's call it C1).
      - description: The second row consists of a single, different color (let's call it C2).
output_grid_structure:
  - type: rows
    count: 2
    properties:
      - description: Uses only the colors C1 and C2 found in the input.
      - description: The first row is an alternating sequence of C1 and C2, starting with C1 at column index 0. The pattern is C1, C2, C1, C2, ...
      - description: The second row is an alternating sequence of C2 and C1, starting with C2 at column index 0. The pattern is C2, C1, C2, C1, ...
relationship_input_output:
  - description: The colors used in the output are directly determined by the colors of the two input rows.
  - description: The pattern in each output row depends on the original row position (first or second) of the colors in the input and the column index (even or odd).
