facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output are 2D grids.
  - observation: |
      Grid values are single-digit integers (0-9).
  - observation: |
     train_1: The number '1' is replaced by '0' and a copy of left side 4x4 matrix is added to the right.
  - observation: |
     train_2: The number '1' is replaced by '0' and a copy of the left side 3x3 matrix added to the right.
  - observation: |
     train_3: Input can be divided into two parts, one part is 3x4 matrix with color '6', the other part is a 3x4 matrix made of numbers from 0,1,4,6 and 4. The first part is repeated three times, interpersed by three copies of only the last row of the second part.
