The transformation seems to duplicate the input grid, stacking the copy below the original.  A key element appears to be the insertion of a row of zeros (white pixels) in the duplicated grid, or expanding an existing band of zeros. The relative location of inserted or expanded zero-value rows vary between train_1 and train_2.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
