            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were based on the first training example, which involved a simple vertical mirroring of objects above the center line. The second example, however, reveals a more complex transformation. While the code correctly mirrors the first example's objects, it fails to completely mirror the second example. Specifically, example 1 transformation is not a complete match. The code only duplicates objects if they are above the center line. It doesn't fully account for objects *crossing* the center line, or the symmetry around the center horizontal. This suggest that the initial assumption of objects are mirrored only above the center line is wrong and it should be objects being mirrored vertically around the horizontal center line.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** The current `find_objects` function seems to work correctly in identifying contiguous blocks of non-white pixels, so we'll keep it.\n2.  **Revise Mirroring Logic:** The core issue is in the `transform` function's mirroring logic. We need to modify it to correctly handle:\n    *   Objects appearing anywhere in the grid\n    *   Objects are vertically mirrored to the other side of the center horizontal.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's analyze each example and the results in more detail.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (12, 22)\n    *   Output Shape: (12, 22) (Correct)\n    *   Match: False\n    * Pixels off = 28\n    *   Objects Above Centerline: Two (one green, one green and red)\n    *   Transformation: The objects above the center line in the input are duplicated *below* the center line, but only the pixels above the center are duplicated.\n    *   Error: It missed completing the mirroring of the full green/red objects.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (17, 7)\n    *   Output Shape: (17, 7) (Correct)\n    *   Match: True\n    *   Objects: Multiple objects with colors 1 (blue) and 4 (yellow)\n    *   Transformation: Objects from top are mirrored to the bottom, objects from the bottom are mirrored to the top.\n    *   Success: The mirroring is done correctly.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
