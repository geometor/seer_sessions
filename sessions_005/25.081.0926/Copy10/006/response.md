Okay, let's analyze the provided information and update the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program focused on mirroring objects vertically above the center line. While this worked perfectly for the second example, it failed on the first. The primary issue in the first example is that the mirroring isn't simply duplicating the top half to the bottom half. Instead, it appears to be mirroring *each object individually* around its *own* centroid, and applying this across the whole image, and it copies those changes to existing data in the lower section.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Object Identification:** The current `find_objects` function correctly identifies contiguous blocks. We need to ensure this function, or a subsequent step, can determine the centroid (or bounding box) of each object.

2.  **Individual Object Mirroring:** The core logic needs to shift from mirroring the entire top half to mirroring each identified object around its own vertical center.

3. **Handle the edge case:** We need to handle the existing objects on the lower part, by overwriting it with the mirrored pixels.

**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code for verification where necessary):**
I will focus my analysis on the parts that are not well defined and where errors occurred, so I will focus more on example 1.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of non-white pixels (objects) in the input grid. Each block of the same color is a separate object, even if they are not contiguous.

2.  **Calculate Centroids:** For each identified object, calculate its vertical centroid (average row value).

3.  **Vertical Mirroring (Per Object):** For each object, mirror it vertically with respect to its centroid. This means, for each pixel in the original object at row `r` and column `c`, a corresponding pixel of the same color is placed at row `r'` and column `c`, where `r'` is calculated as `2 * centroid_row - r`, and `centroid_row` is the integer part of the object centroid row. Overwrite pixels in existing locations.

4. **Output:** Return the grid with all objects vertically mirrored around their centroid.
