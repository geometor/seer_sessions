Here's my breakdown of the task, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program description:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Grids:** The input and output are both grids of varying dimensions, containing single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors.\n*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of the same color can be considered objects.\n*   **Background:** The color white (0) appears to be the background.\n*   **Transformations:** It seems that the main operation might involve inserting one, two, or more instances of a seed set of columns to the right of object instances in select rows of the input grid.\n*    **Colors**: The transformation works on select colors, some colors might be excluded\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

If a row\n    contains non-zero color, then it may be transformed.\n\n2.  **Locate seed object instances:**\n    Scan the non-zero color pixel's row index number. If there are additional instances of\n    the same color in rows below, then identify those rows and column numbers as target\n    transformation locations.\n\n3.  **Insert columns to the right of seed object:** For each transformed row in the original\n    input grid, create an empty output grid. Copy column values to the new row. When a seed object column is\n    encountered, then insert one, two, or more instances of the seed column into the\n    output grid.\n\n4. **Copy Remainder Rows:** Copy any remaining rows from the input that were not\n   transformed.\n\n**Example Explanation using Train_1:**\n\n*   Rows 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11 contain yellow, blue, or green objects.\n*    A single instance of the object's column is inserted to the right of the last pixel in instances of the object in rows 1,3,5,6,8,9,11.\n*    Other rows are copied over to the output without changes\n\n**Example Explanation using Train_2:**\n\n*   Rows 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12 contain magenta, green, orange, or yellow\n    objects.\n*   A varying number of instances of the object's column are insert to the right of instances of\n    the object in rows 1,3-9,12.\n*   Other rows are copied over to the output without changes.\n"
