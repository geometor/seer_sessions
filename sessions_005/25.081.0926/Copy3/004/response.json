            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a single example, and as expected, they don't generalize well to the second example. The core idea of \"seed\" columns and inserting copies is partially correct, but the logic for *where* and *how many* copies to insert is flawed. The current implementation seems to insert based on row differences within the seed color group, which is incorrect, it causes both an offset and an expansion of the wrong rows. Example 2 reveals that insertion needs to be more context-aware, considering the relationships between different colored objects and likely involves a more complex pattern than just row differences. The output is getting the correct size in both cases, the correct color palette, but a large number of pixels in the wrong location.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** We need to meticulously examine both examples, paying close attention to the spatial relationships between colored pixels before and after the transformation. We will use a combination of visual inspection of the input, expected and transformed grids, and targeted code execution.\n\n2.  **Object Identification:** Define what constitutes an \"object\" more rigorously. In these examples, objects seem to be contiguous regions of the same color, potentially connected diagonally or orthogonally.\n\n3.  **Relationship Analysis:** Determine how objects in the input relate to objects in the output. This is the key to understanding the transformation rule. Are objects copied, moved, expanded, or combined?\n\n4.  **Refine Insertion Logic:** Based on the relationship analysis, develop a more precise rule for determining the number and location of insertions.\n\n5. **Update Natural Language Program**: Re-express transformation, taking account the additional knowledge.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Analysis (using manual inspection and code execution):**\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** Multiple colored objects (4, 1, 3). The '4' object appears in multiple discontinuous segments.\n*   **Expected Output:** The '4' object is duplicated in some rows. The '1' object is duplicated. The '3' object is duplicated. Duplication seems to happen only in rows where the original object exists, shifting other objects to the right as needed.\n*   **Transformed Output:** The transformed output incorrectly expands many rows and misplaces elements.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** Objects of colors 6, 3, 7, and 4. There's a more complex arrangement of objects.\n*   **Expected Output:** The transformation involves inserting the '3', '4', '7' column sequence multiple times, and it seems like the placement is in some way initiated by the presence of 6 in a row and shifting existing columns to the right.\n*   **Transformed Output:** The transformation partially works, duplicating some elements but misses the complete pattern.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Identify \"seed objects\" composed of color sequences not single colors\n2. Replicate the *entire* seed object at insertion points, not just individual cells.\n3. Base replication on rows that combine a trigger and seed element.\n"
