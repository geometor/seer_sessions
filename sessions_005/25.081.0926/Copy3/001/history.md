Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output pairs and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program description:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both grids of varying dimensions, containing single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors.
*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of the same color can be considered objects.
*   **Background:** The color white (0) appears to be the background.
*   **Transformations:** It seems that the main operation might involve inserting one, two, or more instances of a seed set of columns to the right of object instances in select rows of the input grid.
*    **Colors**: The transformation works on select colors, some colors might be excluded

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
objects:
  - description: Contiguous blocks of the same non-zero color.
    properties:
      color: Integer value (1-9) representing a color.
      shape: Determined by the arrangement of pixels.
      position: (row, column) coordinates of the pixels.

transformations:
  - type: insertion
    description: Insertion of columns to the right of seed columns.
    details:
     - Select rows are transformed, others remain the same.
     - Number of inserted columns varies, could be one, two, or more.
     - Seed column locations are determined by non-zero, non-background colors.

relations:
    - type: adjacency
      description:  Pixels of the same color next to each other (horizontally or vertically) form an object.
    - type: spatial
      description: Seed objects and inserted column positions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Seed Columns:** Go through each row of the input grid. If a row
    contains non-zero color, then it may be transformed.

2.  **Locate seed object instances:**
    Scan the non-zero color pixel's row index number. If there are additional instances of
    the same color in rows below, then identify those rows and column numbers as target
    transformation locations.

3.  **Insert columns to the right of seed object:** For each transformed row in the original
    input grid, create an empty output grid. Copy column values to the new row. When a seed object column is
    encountered, then insert one, two, or more instances of the seed column into the
    output grid.

4. **Copy Remainder Rows:** Copy any remaining rows from the input that were not
   transformed.

**Example Explanation using Train_1:**

*   Rows 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11 contain yellow, blue, or green objects.
*    A single instance of the object's column is inserted to the right of the last pixel in instances of the object in rows 1,3,5,6,8,9,11.
*    Other rows are copied over to the output without changes

**Example Explanation using Train_2:**

*   Rows 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12 contain magenta, green, orange, or yellow
    objects.
*   A varying number of instances of the object's column are insert to the right of instances of
    the object in rows 1,3-9,12.
*   Other rows are copied over to the output without changes.
