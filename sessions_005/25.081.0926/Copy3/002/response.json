            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a reasonable, but ultimately incorrect, interpretation of the transformation. The core idea of identifying \"seed\" columns and inserting copies is partially correct, but the logic for *where* and *how many* copies to insert is flawed. The provided examples and, in particular, the errors in the transformed outputs, highlight these deficiencies.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Insertion Logic (Example 1):** The code inserts far too many copies in some cases and doesn't always insert in the correct places. In Example 1, the yellow (4) columns are replicated excessively.  It's treating *all* non-zero pixels as seeds for column duplication, rather than considering the spatial relationships and patterns. The code's attempt to calculate `insertions` based on row differences is not working as intended and doesn't consider the overall structure.\n2.  **Incorrect Insertion Logic (Example 2):** Example 2 shows a more complex pattern. The insertion is based on the relative vertical positions.\n3. The existing logic will need to be modified in both how it selects the columns to duplicate, and in how it places the copies.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Seed Column Identification:** Instead of treating every non-zero pixel as a seed, we need to identify seed columns.  It's probable that entire columns, or specific sub-sections of columns, are the \"seeds\".\n2.  **Analyze Relative Positions:** Focus on the spatial relationships *between* colored regions in the input and output.\n3. **Consider row-specific behavior:** it appears not all rows have the same behavior\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:**  Start with a simplified version of the rule, test it, and add complexity as needed to match the observed transformations.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution when needed)**\n\nSince there aren't any specific metrics other than the general observation of \"pixels off\", the error report is already sufficient. The key issue is to study the input, expected output, and the incorrect output and determine the nature of the errors.\n\n**YAML Fact Base**\n\n"

These stacks define the \"seed columns\".\n2.  **Group by Color:** Group the seed column pixels by their color.\n3.  **Row-Specific Insertion:** For each color:\n    *   Identify the rows where this color appears in the seed columns.\n    *   For each identified row, copy the pixel from the original seed column. Insert additional copies of the same color from seed column to the right of the original pixel.\n    *   The number of inserted columns will be equal to difference between row indices of the colored pixels of same color.\n4.  **Other Rows:** Rows that do *not* contain any of the seed colors are copied directly from the input to the output without modification.\n5. Prevent expansion: if inserted columns would exceed bounds of input grid, trim them\n\nThis revised program takes into account the key observations from both examples, particularly the concept of specific \"seed\" colors and the row-specific nature of the insertion, which depends directly on the vertical position of seed colors.\n"
