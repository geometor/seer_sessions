            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code successfully identifies two rectangular shapes and attempts to overlay an inner shape from the first onto the second. However, it fails in both provided examples. The primary issue seems to be an incorrect assumption about which parts to overlay, and potentially in how the centering is calculated or how the \"inner shape\" is defined. The code assumes any area of shape 1 that is not of the border color should be overlaid. The first shape could contain multiple \"inner\" areas. The transformation failed in both example cases.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Clarify Inner Shape Definition:** The current definition of the inner shape as any pixel within the outer rectangle that doesn't match the border color is too broad. We need to specifically identify the *contiguous* inner rectangle, likely using a similar depth-first search (DFS) as used to find the outer shapes.\n2.  **Verify Centering Logic:** Double-check the row and column centering calculations. The current logic seems generally correct (find the difference in sizes and divide by 2) but may have subtle errors.\n3.  **Object Identification:** Instead of assuming that shape 1 will always be on top, check color to identify objects.\n4.  **Shape2 Interior:** Instead of assuming shape2 will contain empty space, get the inner shape of shape 2 in the same way as shape 1.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's analyze each example in detail:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n"
