However, the provided test results reveal that this transformation only replicates the input, doubling its size, and does not necessarily respect the output size, which is sometimes smaller than the double size. The actual transformation appears to simply select the upper left section of the full copied grid.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Dimensions:** I need to calculate and compare the dimensions of the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example. This will precisely identify the size discrepancies.\n2.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** I will update the natural language program to reflect the correct transformation, which I will be able to test.\n3.  **YAML Fact Documentation:** Create a structured YAML representation of observed facts, which is not needed at this stage, I just need to update my natural language program.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis (using code execution):**\n\n"
