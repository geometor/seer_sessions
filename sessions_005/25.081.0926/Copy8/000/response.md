Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing single-digit integers representing colors. The primary elements appear to be contiguous blocks of the same color, which can be considered "objects". The transformation seems to involve a selective, patterned duplication or shifting of certain parts of the input grid to form the output grid. The background (0, or white) seems to be mostly unchanged, providing a constant canvas. There's an apparent interaction between different colored objects.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      The background color (0) remains largely unchanged.
  - observation: |
      Objects are contiguous blocks of the same color.
  - observation: |
      In train_1, the red (2) object in the top-left corner expands to the right.
  - observation: |
      In train_2, the last two columns of the green object appear in output shifted one column to the right.
  - observation: |
       there is a change in the shape of the input objects on the output
  - object_property: |
      Colors present: 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 3 (green), 4 (yellow).
  - relation: |
     There seems to be a rightward shifting or duplication of specific colored object parts, particularly the final two columns.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of non-zero colored pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Selective Duplication:** For each object find the last two columns.
3.  **Shift:** Duplicate the last two columns of the target and position the duplicate one column to the right.
4.  **Output:** Preserve the background (0-colored pixels) and combine the original and duplicated parts to form the final output grid.

Essentially, the transformation takes the last two columns of each "object" and shifts/duplicates them one column to the right.
