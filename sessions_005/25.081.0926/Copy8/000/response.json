The primary elements appear to be contiguous blocks of the same color, which can be considered \"objects\". The transformation seems to involve a selective, patterned duplication or shifting of certain parts of the input grid to form the output grid. The background (0, or white) seems to be mostly unchanged, providing a constant canvas. There's an apparent interaction between different colored objects.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
