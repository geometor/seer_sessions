            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for resolving the errors in the transformation.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code were too simplistic. The core idea of identifying \"objects\" (contiguous non-zero pixels) is correct, but the column duplication and shifting logic is flawed and doesn't generalize to all cases. The code duplicates the last two columns of *each object* and shifts them one column to the right *within the bounds of that object*.  This works only in very specific circumstances (like the objects in the examples not overlapping in their x-coordinates). The expected outputs in Examples 1 and 2 clearly show this logic is incorrect. It appears that shifting/copying to the right is not constrained by object boundaries. It copies over anything, including zeros. The transformation must preserve the original grid's structure where possible.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1. **Verify Object Identification:** Ensure the `get_objects` function correctly identifies all contiguous non-zero regions as separate objects. This seems to work as designed so far.\n2. **Re-examine Transformation Logic:** The column duplication logic is incorrect. Analyze the examples to discern the *precise* rule for how columns are duplicated and shifted. It's likely a grid-wide operation, not an object-specific one.\n3. **Consider Edge Cases:** Pay attention to what happens at the edges of the grid and when objects are adjacent.\n4. **Iterative Refinement:**  Use the feedback from each example to progressively refine the natural language program and the code.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example 1):**\n\n- **Input:** A grid with two distinct objects (red and blue).\n- **Expected Output:** The last two columns of the *entire grid where there are objects* are duplicated and shifted to the right. The red block becomes bigger to the right.\n- **Transformed Output:** Only the last two columns *within each object* are duplicated and shifted, leading to an incorrect result.\n- **Mismatch:** The transformed output fails to correctly duplicate and shift the columns to the right, especially at the object boundaries.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example 2):**\n\n- **Input:** A grid with multiple objects of yellow and a smaller green object.\n- **Expected Output:** The last two columns of the grid are duplicated for regions that have colors. The green block is also duplicated, but now shifted to the right by one.\n- **Transformed Output:** Again, the duplication and shifting are confined within each object, resulting in significant errors.\n- **Mismatch:** The transformed output does a very poor job of copying to the right.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
