            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was too specific, focusing on a very narrow interpretation of the first example. It correctly identified the \"look-ahead\" pattern (checking two pixels to the right) but failed to generalize the color-changing rule. The second example reveals that the color change isn't simply based on green/orange and blue/blue combinations. It's more about copying the color of the original pixel to the adjacent black pixel *if* a certain condition two pixels to the right is met. The condition changes in each case.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the examples:** Carefully study *all* provided examples to identify the *general* rule governing the color change, not just specific instances.\n2.  **Identify the correct condition:** The core issue is understanding what condition two pixels to the right triggers the color change.\n3.  **Broaden the rule:** The natural language program needs to express a more general condition that covers all cases, not just the specific colors seen in the first example.\n4.  **Focus on Object Interactions**: Establish which object is being modified, what object(s) is triggering the changes, and what the modification is.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Analyze Examples:**\n\nI'll use a manual approach here, as I can directly analyze the grids.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Magenta/Green object, followed by black, followed by orange. Green changes adjacent black to Green.\n    *   Pixels off: 6 (all in the originally all-black vertical line, many should be green)\n    *   Observation: Green next to black, with orange two to the right, changes the black pixel. This part of the logic *was* correctly captured, but only on the bottom row.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Blue object, followed by black, followed by blue. Blue changes adjacent black to blue.\n    *    Pixels off: 3 (a vertical line of black that are different).\n    *   Observation: Blue (2) next to black, with blue (1) two to the right, changes the black to blue. This rule was *incorrectly* generalized only to blue(2) followed by blue(1), and so was only coincidentally correct for those pixels which matched that criteria.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n"

Otherwise do not modify pixels.\n\nThis revised program expresses a general rule: a non-black pixel will \"copy\" its color to an adjacent black pixel *if and only if* the pixel two positions to the right of the non-black pixel matches the color of the original pixel.\n"
