Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n*   **Grids:** The input and output are both grids of integers, representing colors.\n*   **Color Changes:** It appears that there are specific and possibly conditional color changes applied to the pixels.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** The position of the changed colors seems important. The changes often appear near the center of existing color blocks.\n* **Objectness** - there are clearly identifiable objects as color blocks in both the input and output, and in both cases the objects persist\n* **Goal-directedness** - there may be an intention to modify certain color blocks based on adjacent colors\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n"
