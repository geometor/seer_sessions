elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - contains pixels of various colors (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value 0-9
      - position: (row, column)
      - role:
          - background (white, 0)
          - boundary (non-white, 1-9)
          - fill (red, 2, appears in output)
relationships:
  - type: horizontal adjacency
    between: pixels in the same row
  - type: containment
    description: Red fill pixels are contained horizontally between boundary pixels on the same row.
actions:
  - name: identify_boundaries
    inputs:
      - input grid row
    outputs:
      - column indices of non-white pixels
  - name: find_extrema
    inputs:
      - list of column indices
    outputs:
      - minimum column index
      - maximum column index
  - name: fill_between
    inputs:
      - input grid row
      - minimum column index
      - maximum column index
    outputs:
      - modified grid row
    condition: Only white pixels between the min and max columns (exclusive) are changed to red.
    parameters:
      - fill_color: red (2)
transformation:
  - Apply actions row by row to the input grid.
  - If a row has fewer than two boundary pixels, it is copied directly to the output.
  - Otherwise, fill the white pixels between the leftmost and rightmost boundary pixels with red.
