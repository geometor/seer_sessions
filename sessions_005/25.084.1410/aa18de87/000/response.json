The core transformation is filling the horizontal space between the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels in a row with the color red (2), but only if the original pixel in that space was white (0). The original non-white pixels remain unchanged in the output. If a row contains fewer than two non-white pixels, it remains unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
