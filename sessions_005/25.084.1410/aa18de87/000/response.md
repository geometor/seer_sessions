**Perception**

The task involves modifying an input grid based on the positions of non-white pixels within each row. The core transformation is filling the horizontal space between the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels in a row with the color red (2), but only if the original pixel in that space was white (0). The original non-white pixels remain unchanged in the output. If a row contains fewer than two non-white pixels, it remains unchanged.

**Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - contains pixels of various colors (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value 0-9
      - position: (row, column)
      - role:
          - background (white, 0)
          - boundary (non-white, 1-9)
          - fill (red, 2, appears in output)
relationships:
  - type: horizontal adjacency
    between: pixels in the same row
  - type: containment
    description: Red fill pixels are contained horizontally between boundary pixels on the same row.
actions:
  - name: identify_boundaries
    inputs:
      - input grid row
    outputs:
      - column indices of non-white pixels
  - name: find_extrema
    inputs:
      - list of column indices
    outputs:
      - minimum column index
      - maximum column index
  - name: fill_between
    inputs:
      - input grid row
      - minimum column index
      - maximum column index
    outputs:
      - modified grid row
    condition: Only white pixels between the min and max columns (exclusive) are changed to red.
    parameters:
      - fill_color: red (2)
transformation:
  - Apply actions row by row to the input grid.
  - If a row has fewer than two boundary pixels, it is copied directly to the output.
  - Otherwise, fill the white pixels between the leftmost and rightmost boundary pixels with red.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid using its row index.
3.  For the current row, find the column indices of all pixels that are not white (color 0).
4.  If the number of non-white pixels found in the row is less than 2, continue to the next row.
5.  If there are 2 or more non-white pixels, determine the minimum (leftmost) column index and the maximum (rightmost) column index among them.
6.  Iterate through the columns from the minimum column index + 1 up to (but not including) the maximum column index.
7.  For each column index in this range, check the color of the pixel at the current row and column index in the *input* grid.
8.  If the pixel color is white (0), change the color of the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid to red (2).
9.  After processing all rows, return the final output grid.
