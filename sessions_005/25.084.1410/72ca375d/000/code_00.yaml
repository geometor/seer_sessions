task_context:
  problem_type: object_selection_extraction
  input_features:
    - grid_representation: 2D array of integers (colors)
    - background_color: white (0)
    - content: multiple distinct objects (contiguous non-white pixels)
    - number_of_objects: consistently 3 per example
  output_features:
    - grid_representation: 2D array of integers (colors)
    - content: a single object extracted from the input
    - size: minimal bounding box of the selected object

object_definitions:
  - object: contiguous group of pixels with the same non-white color.

observations:
  - Each input contains exactly three distinct objects.
  - The output contains exactly one object from the input.
  - The selection criterion is based on the color values of the objects.

relationships:
  - The output object's color value is the median of the set of color values of all distinct objects in the input grid.
  - The output grid dimensions are determined by the bounding box of the selected object.

actions:
  - identify_objects: Find all contiguous non-white pixel groups.
  - get_object_colors: Determine the color of each identified object.
  - calculate_median_color: Find the median value from the set of object colors.
  - select_object: Identify the object corresponding to the median color.
  - calculate_bounding_box: Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices for the selected object.
  - extract_subgrid: Create the output grid using the bounding box coordinates applied to the input grid.
