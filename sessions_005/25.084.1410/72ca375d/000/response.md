Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids are 10x10 and contain a white background (color 0) with several distinct objects scattered across them. An object is a contiguous block of pixels of the same non-white color. In all provided examples, there are exactly three distinct objects.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are smaller than the input grids. They contain only one object, which is identical in shape and color to one of the objects present in the corresponding input grid. The output grid seems to be the minimal bounding box around the selected object.
3.  **Transformation Goal:** The core task is to identify which of the objects from the input grid should be selected and then extract its bounding box to form the output grid.
4.  **Identifying the Selection Criteria:**
    *   The selected object isn't consistently the largest or smallest in terms of pixel count or bounding box area.
    *   The position doesn't seem relevant.
    *   The shape (e.g., square, L-shape, rectangle, T-shape) varies, and no single shape type is consistently chosen.
    *   Let's consider the *colors* of the objects present in each input:
        *   Example 1: Yellow (4), Azure (8), Red (2). Output Object: Yellow (4).
        *   Example 2: Red (2), Orange (7), Magenta (6). Output Object: Magenta (6).
        *   Example 3: Green (3), Gray (5), Azure (8). Output Object: Gray (5).
    *   If we sort the color values for each example:
        *   Example 1: [2, 4, 8]. Median is 4. Output object color is 4.
        *   Example 2: [2, 6, 7]. Median is 6. Output object color is 6.
        *   Example 3: [3, 5, 8]. Median is 5. Output object color is 5.
    *   The pattern appears consistent: the object selected is the one whose color value is the *median* of all the distinct object colors present in the input grid.

## Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  problem_type: object_selection_extraction
  input_features:
    - grid_representation: 2D array of integers (colors)
    - background_color: white (0)
    - content: multiple distinct objects (contiguous non-white pixels)
    - number_of_objects: consistently 3 per example
  output_features:
    - grid_representation: 2D array of integers (colors)
    - content: a single object extracted from the input
    - size: minimal bounding box of the selected object

object_definitions:
  - object: contiguous group of pixels with the same non-white color.

observations:
  - Each input contains exactly three distinct objects.
  - The output contains exactly one object from the input.
  - The selection criterion is based on the color values of the objects.

relationships:
  - The output object's color value is the median of the set of color values of all distinct objects in the input grid.
  - The output grid dimensions are determined by the bounding box of the selected object.

actions:
  - identify_objects: Find all contiguous non-white pixel groups.
  - get_object_colors: Determine the color of each identified object.
  - calculate_median_color: Find the median value from the set of object colors.
  - select_object: Identify the object corresponding to the median color.
  - calculate_bounding_box: Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices for the selected object.
  - extract_subgrid: Create the output grid using the bounding box coordinates applied to the input grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a connected group of pixels sharing the same non-white color.
2.  Create a list containing the color value of each unique object identified.
3.  Sort this list of color values in ascending order.
4.  Determine the median color value from the sorted list. (Since there are always three objects, this will be the second color in the sorted list).
5.  Find the object in the input grid whose color matches this median color value.
6.  Calculate the bounding box (minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, maximum column) that tightly encloses the pixels of this selected object.
7.  Construct the output grid by copying the portion of the input grid defined by the calculated bounding box.
