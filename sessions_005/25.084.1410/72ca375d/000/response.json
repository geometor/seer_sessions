An object is a contiguous block of pixels of the same non-white color. In all provided examples, there are exactly three distinct objects.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are smaller than the input grids. They contain only one object, which is identical in shape and color to one of the objects present in the corresponding input grid. The output grid seems to be the minimal bounding box around the selected object.\n3.  **Transformation Goal:** The core task is to identify which of the objects from the input grid should be selected and then extract its bounding box to form the output grid.\n4.  **Identifying the Selection Criteria:**\n    *   The selected object isn't consistently the largest or smallest in terms of pixel count or bounding box area.\n    *   The position doesn't seem relevant.\n    *   The shape (e.g., square, L-shape, rectangle, T-shape) varies, and no single shape type is consistently chosen.\n    *   Let's consider the *colors* of the objects present in each input:\n        *   Example 1: Yellow (4), Azure (8), Red (2). Output Object: Yellow (4).\n        *   Example 2: Red (2), Orange (7), Magenta (6). Output Object: Magenta (6).\n        *   Example 3: Green (3), Gray (5), Azure (8). Output Object: Gray (5).\n    *   If we sort the color values for each example:\n        *   Example 1: [2, 4, 8]. Median is 4. Output object color is 4.\n        *   Example 2: [2, 6, 7]. Median is 6. Output object color is 6.\n        *   Example 3: [3, 5, 8]. Median is 5. Output object color is 5.\n    *   The pattern appears consistent: the object selected is the one whose color value is the *median* of all the distinct object colors present in the input grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
