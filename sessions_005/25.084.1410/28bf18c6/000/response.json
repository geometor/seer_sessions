Specifically, the output appears to be constructed by taking the minimal rectangular bounding box surrounding the non-white object in the input and then concatenating this bounding box content horizontally with itself. The output grid's height matches the bounding box height, and its width is twice the bounding box width.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
