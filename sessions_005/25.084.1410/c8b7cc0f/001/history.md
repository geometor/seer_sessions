Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids vary in size but generally contain a white background (0), a large, connected shape made of blue pixels (1), and several scattered pixels of a single other color (magenta=6, yellow=4, or green=3).
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are consistently 3x3.
3.  **Color Transformation:** The output grid's non-white color corresponds to the color of the scattered pixels in the input grid. The blue color (1) from the input is completely absent in the output. The white background (0) is preserved in some parts of the output.
4.  **Pattern Identification:** The scattered pixels in the input seem to act as identifiers for the color to be used in the output. Their specific locations within the input grid do not appear to influence the output pattern.
5.  **Output Pattern:** The output grid follows a fixed pattern using the identified color:
    *   Top row: Filled with the identified color.
    *   Middle row: First two cells filled with the identified color, last cell is white.
    *   Bottom row: All white.
6.  **Object Identification:** We can identify three types of elements in the input: the background (white), a large boundary object (blue), and scattered "signal" objects (magenta, yellow, or green). The transformation rule focuses on the color of the "signal" objects.

## Facts


```yaml
facts:
  - Labeled Objects:
      - Input Grid:
        - Background: Color 0 (white).
        - Boundary Object: Largest contiguous non-background object, always color 1 (blue) in examples.
        - Signal Objects: Small, scattered objects, not color 0 or 1. Examples use color 6 (magenta), 4 (yellow), 3 (green). Always a single color per input grid.
      - Output Grid:
        - Background: Color 0 (white).
        - Pattern Pixels: Pixels matching the color of the input's Signal Objects.
  - Properties:
      - Input Grid Size: Variable (e.g., 9x9, 7x7, 9x9).
      - Output Grid Size: Fixed (3x3).
      - Signal Color: The single color present in the input grid that is neither the background (0) nor the color of the largest contiguous object (1).
  - Relationships:
      - The color of the Pattern Pixels in the output grid is determined by the Signal Color from the input grid.
      - The Boundary Object (blue) in the input is ignored when constructing the output.
      - The positions of the Signal Objects in the input do not affect the output pattern.
  - Actions:
      - Identify the Signal Color in the input grid.
      - Construct a fixed 3x3 grid pattern using the identified Signal Color and white (0).
  - Output Pattern Structure:
    - Size: 3x3
    - Row 0: [Signal Color, Signal Color, Signal Color]
    - Row 1: [Signal Color, Signal Color, White]
    - Row 2: [White, White, White]

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Analyze the input grid to identify all distinct colors present, excluding the background color (0).
2.  Determine the largest contiguous object composed of a single non-background color. Note its color (which is consistently blue=1 in the examples).
3.  Identify the remaining non-background color present in the grid (this will be the color of the scattered 'signal' objects). Let this be the `signal_color`.
4.  Create a new 3x3 grid, initially filled with white (0).
5.  Set the cells at coordinates (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), and (1,1) to the `signal_color`.
6.  The resulting 3x3 grid is the output.
