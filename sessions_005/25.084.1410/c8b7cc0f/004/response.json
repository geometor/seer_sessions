            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code successfully identified the 'signal color' (non-white, non-blue) and correctly structured the 3x3 output grid with the first row filled with the signal color and the third row filled with white (0). However, the logic for determining the number of signal-colored pixels in the second row, based on `signal_count % 3`, failed for two out of the three training examples.\n\n-   Example 1 (N=8) was correct because `8 % 3 = 2`, matching the expected 2 pixels in the second row.\n-   Example 2 (N=7) failed because `7 % 3 = 1`, but the expected output has 0 pixels in the second row.\n-   Example 3 (N=9) failed because `9 % 3 = 0`, but the expected output has 1 pixel in the second row.\n\nThe strategy is to re-evaluate the relationship between the count of the signal color (`N`) in the input grid and the number of signal-colored pixels (`M`) in the second row of the output grid. We will analyze the `N` values and the corresponding expected `M` values from all three examples to deduce the correct rule.\n\n## Gather Metrics\n\nLet's calculate the signal color count (`N`) and the expected number of signal pixels in the second row (`M_expected`) for each example.\n\n"
