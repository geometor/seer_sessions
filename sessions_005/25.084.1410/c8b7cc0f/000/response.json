The blue color (1) from the input is completely absent in the output. The white background (0) is preserved in some parts of the output.\n4.  **Pattern Identification:** The scattered pixels in the input seem to act as identifiers for the color to be used in the output. Their specific locations within the input grid do not appear to influence the output pattern.\n5.  **Output Pattern:** The output grid follows a fixed pattern using the identified color:\n    *   Top row: Filled with the identified color.\n    *   Middle row: First two cells filled with the identified color, last cell is white.\n    *   Bottom row: All white.\n6.  **Object Identification:** We can identify three types of elements in the input: the background (white), a large boundary object (blue), and scattered \"signal\" objects (magenta, yellow, or green). The transformation rule focuses on the color of the \"signal\" objects.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
