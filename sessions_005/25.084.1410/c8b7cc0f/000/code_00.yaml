facts:
  - Labeled Objects:
      - Input Grid:
        - Background: Color 0 (white).
        - Boundary Object: Largest contiguous non-background object, always color 1 (blue) in examples.
        - Signal Objects: Small, scattered objects, not color 0 or 1. Examples use color 6 (magenta), 4 (yellow), 3 (green). Always a single color per input grid.
      - Output Grid:
        - Background: Color 0 (white).
        - Pattern Pixels: Pixels matching the color of the input's Signal Objects.
  - Properties:
      - Input Grid Size: Variable (e.g., 9x9, 7x7, 9x9).
      - Output Grid Size: Fixed (3x3).
      - Signal Color: The single color present in the input grid that is neither the background (0) nor the color of the largest contiguous object (1).
  - Relationships:
      - The color of the Pattern Pixels in the output grid is determined by the Signal Color from the input grid.
      - The Boundary Object (blue) in the input is ignored when constructing the output.
      - The positions of the Signal Objects in the input do not affect the output pattern.
  - Actions:
      - Identify the Signal Color in the input grid.
      - Construct a fixed 3x3 grid pattern using the identified Signal Color and white (0).
  - Output Pattern Structure:
    - Size: 3x3
    - Row 0: [Signal Color, Signal Color, Signal Color]
    - Row 1: [Signal Color, Signal Color, White]
    - Row 2: [White, White, White]
