"""
Identifies the 'signal color' in the input grid, which is the non-background (0) 
color that is not the color of the largest contiguous object (assumed to be 1, blue, 
based on examples). Then, constructs a fixed 3x3 output grid pattern using this 
signal color and the background color (0, white). The pattern is:
Row 0: [Signal Color, Signal Color, Signal Color]
Row 1: [Signal Color, Signal Color, White]
Row 2: [White, White, White]
