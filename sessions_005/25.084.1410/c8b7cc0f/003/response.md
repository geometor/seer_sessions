"""
Identifies the 'signal color' in the input grid, which is the non-background (0) 
color that is not blue (1). It then counts the occurrences of this signal color 
in the input grid (let the count be N). An output 3x3 grid is constructed where:
- The first row is entirely filled with the signal color.
- The third row is entirely filled with the background color (0, white).
- The second row contains M signal-colored pixels starting from the left, where M = N % 3. 
  The remaining cells in the second row are white (0).
