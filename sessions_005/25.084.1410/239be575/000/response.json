The goal is to determine a rule based on the spatial relationship between the red and azure pixels that determines whether the output is 0 or 8.\n\nObserving the examples, the red pixels consistently form 2x2 squares, while the azure pixels form objects of various shapes and sizes. The determining factor appears to be whether any part of a red object comes into contact (either side-by-side or diagonally) with any part of an azure object.\n\n*   If any red pixel is adjacent (including diagonals) to any azure pixel, the output is 0.\n*   If no red pixel is adjacent to any azure pixel, the output is 8.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
