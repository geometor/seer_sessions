Get the color of this pixel, let's call it `paint_color`.\n2. Create a temporary subgrid pattern based on the original input grid.\n3. In this temporary subgrid pattern, replace all non-background pixels with the `paint_color`. Background pixels remain background.\n4. Determine the top-left position in the output grid for this subgrid: `(start_row, start_col) = (r * H, c * W)`, where H and W are the height and width of the input grid.\n5. Place this modified, colored subgrid into the output grid at the calculated position.\n\nIf the input pixel `input_grid[r, c]` is the background color (white, 0), the corresponding subgrid location in the output grid remains filled with the background color.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by scaling it up and using the input grid as a template,\n    colored by the corresponding pixel in the original input.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.array): A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.array: A 2D numpy array representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the dimensions of the input grid\n    H, W = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Calculate the dimensions of the output grid\n    output_H = H * H\n    output_W = W * W\n\n    # Initialize the output grid with the background color (white, 0)\n    output_grid = np.zeros((output_H, output_W), dtype=int)\n\n    # Iterate through each cell of the input grid\n    for r in range(H):\n        for c in range(W):\n            # Get the color of the current pixel in the input grid\n            paint_color = input_grid[r, c]\n\n            # Check if the current input pixel is not the background color\n            if paint_color != 0:\n                # Create the colored subgrid pattern\n                # Where the input_grid is not 0, use paint_color, otherwise use 0 (background)\n                colored_subgrid = np.where(input_grid != 0, paint_color, 0)\n\n                # Calculate the top-left coordinates for placing the subgrid in the output grid\n                start_row = r * H\n                start_col = c * W\n                \n                # Calculate the bottom-right coordinates (exclusive) for the subgrid\n                end_row = start_row + H\n                end_col = start_col + W\n                \n                # Place the colored subgrid into the calculated location in the output grid\n                output_grid[start_row:end_row, start_col:end_col] = colored_subgrid\n\n    # Return the completed output grid\n    return output_grid\n```"
