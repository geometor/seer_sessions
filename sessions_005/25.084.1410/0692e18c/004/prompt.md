Previous Code:
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transform a small input grid into a larger output grid. 
The output grid's dimensions are derived by multiplying the input grid's height and width by themselves (H -> H*H, W -> W*W).
The output grid can be viewed as a grid of subgrids, where each subgrid has the same dimensions as the input grid.

Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at coordinates (r, c). 
If the input pixel `input_grid[r, c]` is not the background color (white, 0):
1. Get the color of this pixel, let's call it `paint_color`.
2. Create a temporary subgrid pattern based on the original input grid.
3. In this temporary subgrid pattern, replace all non-background pixels with the `paint_color`. Background pixels remain background.
4. Determine the top-left position in the output grid for this subgrid: `(start_row, start_col) = (r * H, c * W)`, where H and W are the height and width of the input grid.
5. Place this modified, colored subgrid into the output grid at the calculated position.

If the input pixel `input_grid[r, c]` is the background color (white, 0), the corresponding subgrid location in the output grid remains filled with the background color.
