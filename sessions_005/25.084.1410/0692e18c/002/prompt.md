```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transform a small input grid into a larger output grid. 
The output grid's dimensions are derived by multiplying the input grid's height and width by themselves (H -> H*H, W -> W*W).
The output grid can be viewed as a grid of subgrids, where each subgrid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. If an input pixel at (r, c) is not the background color (white, 0), 
then copy the *entire* original input grid into the corresponding subgrid of the output grid. 
The top-left corner of this subgrid in the output grid is at (r * H, c * W), where H and W are the height and width of the input grid.
If the input pixel is the background color, the corresponding subgrid in the output remains filled with the background color.
