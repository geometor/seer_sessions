The output dimensions are 3 times the input dimensions in both height and width (3x3 -> 9x9).\n2.  **Grid Structure:** The 9x9 output grid can be viewed as a 3x3 grid of 3x3 subgrids.\n3.  **Content Mapping:** The content of the output grid seems related to the positions of non-white pixels in the input grid.\n4.  **Pattern:**\n    *   For each pixel in the 3x3 input grid, examine its color.\n    *   If the input pixel at position (row `r`, col `c`) is *not* white (0), then the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the output grid, located at the top-left corner `(r * 3, c * 3)`, is a direct copy of the *entire* 3x3 input grid.\n    *   If the input pixel at position (row `r`, col `c`) *is* white (0), then the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the output grid, located at the top-left corner `(r * 3, c * 3)`, is filled entirely with white (0).\n5.  **Color Consistency:** The colors used within the copied subgrids in the output are the same as the colors in the original input grid. The background color is consistently white (0).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
