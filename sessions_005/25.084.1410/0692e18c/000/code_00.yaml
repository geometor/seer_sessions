task_description: "Transform a small input grid into a larger output grid by using the input grid as a template to place copies of itself."

elements:
  - name: input_grid
    description: "A small grid (3x3 in examples) containing pixels of various colors, including a background color (white, 0)."
    properties:
      - size: H x W (e.g., 3x3)
      - pixels: Each pixel has a color value (0-9).
  - name: output_grid
    description: "A larger grid, scaled relative to the input grid."
    properties:
      - size: (H*H) x (W*W) (e.g., 9x9)
      - structure: Can be conceptually divided into HxW subgrids, each of size HxW.
      - pixels: Each pixel has a color value (0-9).
  - name: subgrid
    description: "A block within the output grid corresponding in size to the input grid."
    properties:
      - size: H x W (e.g., 3x3)
      - position: Determined by the corresponding pixel location in the input grid.

relationships:
  - type: scaling
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    details: "Output grid dimensions are input_height*input_height by input_width*input_width."
  - type: mapping
    source: input_grid pixel at (r, c)
    target: output_grid subgrid at top-left (r*H, c*W)
    details: "The content of the subgrid depends on the color of the corresponding input pixel."

actions:
  - name: determine_output_size
    input: input_grid dimensions (H, W)
    output: output_grid dimensions ((H*H), (W*W))
  - name: initialize_output_grid
    input: output_grid dimensions
    output: output_grid filled with background color (white, 0)
  - name: process_input_pixels
    input: input_grid
    output: modified output_grid
    steps:
      - "Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the input_grid."
      - "If input_grid[r, c] is not white (0):"
        - "Copy the entire input_grid into the output_grid subgrid starting at (r*H, c*W)."
      - "If input_grid[r, c] is white (0):"
        - "The corresponding output_grid subgrid remains filled with white (0) (as per initialization)."

constants:
  - background_color: 0 (white)
