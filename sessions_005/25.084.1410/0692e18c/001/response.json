If an input pixel at (r, c) is not the background color (white, 0), \nthen copy the *entire* original input grid into the corresponding subgrid of the output grid. \nThe top-left corner of this subgrid in the output grid is at (r * H, c * W), where H and W are the height and width of the input grid.\nIf the input pixel is the background color, the corresponding subgrid in the output remains filled with the background color.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on the rule described above.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.array): A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.array: A 2D numpy array representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the dimensions of the input grid\n    H, W = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Calculate the dimensions of the output grid\n    output_H = H * H\n    output_W = W * W\n\n    # Initialize the output grid with the background color (white, 0)\n    output_grid = np.zeros((output_H, output_W), dtype=int)\n\n    # Iterate through each cell of the input grid\n    for r in range(H):\n        for c in range(W):\n            # Check if the current input pixel is not the background color\n            if input_grid[r, c] != 0:\n                # Calculate the top-left coordinates for the subgrid in the output grid\n                start_row = r * H\n                start_col = c * W\n                \n                # Calculate the bottom-right coordinates (exclusive) for the subgrid\n                end_row = start_row + H\n                end_col = start_col + W\n                \n                # Copy the entire input grid into the calculated subgrid location\n                output_grid[start_row:end_row, start_col:end_col] = input_grid\n\n    # Return the completed output grid\n    return output_grid\n```"
