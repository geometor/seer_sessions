Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Size:** The input grids are consistently 3x3. The output grids are consistently 9x9. The output dimensions are 3 times the input dimensions in both height and width (3x3 -> 9x9).
2.  **Grid Structure:** The 9x9 output grid can be viewed as a 3x3 grid of 3x3 subgrids.
3.  **Content Mapping:** The content of the output grid seems related to the positions of non-white pixels in the input grid.
4.  **Pattern:**
    *   For each pixel in the 3x3 input grid, examine its color.
    *   If the input pixel at position (row `r`, col `c`) is *not* white (0), then the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the output grid, located at the top-left corner `(r * 3, c * 3)`, is a direct copy of the *entire* 3x3 input grid.
    *   If the input pixel at position (row `r`, col `c`) *is* white (0), then the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the output grid, located at the top-left corner `(r * 3, c * 3)`, is filled entirely with white (0).
5.  **Color Consistency:** The colors used within the copied subgrids in the output are the same as the colors in the original input grid. The background color is consistently white (0).

elements:
  - name: input_grid
    description: "A small grid (3x3 in examples) containing pixels of various colors, including a background color (white, 0)."
    properties:
      - size: H x W (e.g., 3x3)
      - pixels: Each pixel has a color value (0-9).

    description: "A larger grid, scaled relative to the input grid."
    properties:
      - size: (H*H) x (W*W) (e.g., 9x9)
      - structure: Can be conceptually divided into HxW subgrids, each of size HxW.
      - pixels: Each pixel has a color value (0-9).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions (H\*H) by (W\*W), initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid using its row index `r` (from 0 to H-1) and column index `c` (from 0 to W-1).
4.  For each input cell at `(r, c)`:
    a.  Check the color of the pixel at `input_grid[r, c]`.
    b.  If the color is *not* the background color (white, 0):
        i.  Calculate the top-left coordinates of the corresponding subgrid in the output grid: `output_start_row = r * H`, `output_start_col = c * W`.
        ii. Copy the *entire* HxW input grid into the output grid, placing its top-left corner at `(output_start_row, output_start_col)`. Overwrite the existing background pixels in that subgrid.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
