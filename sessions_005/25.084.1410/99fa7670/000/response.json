They contain mostly white background pixels (0) and a few isolated non-white pixels. These non-white pixels can be considered distinct objects.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the original non-white pixels from the input. Additionally, new pixels are added, forming extensions from the original pixels.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** For each non-white pixel in the input, two lines of the same color are drawn in the output:\n    *   A horizontal line starting from the column immediately to the right of the original pixel and extending all the way to the right edge of the grid, in the same row as the original pixel.\n    *   A vertical line starting from the row immediately below the original pixel and extending all the way to the bottom edge of the grid. This vertical line is drawn in the *last column* of the grid.\n4.  **Object Interaction/Overwriting:** When these drawn lines from different source pixels overlap, or overlap with an original pixel from a different source, the color of the pixel processed *later* overwrites the previous color. The processing order appears to be based on the original position of the source pixels: top-to-bottom, then left-to-right.\n5.  **Grid Boundaries:** The extensions (lines) always extend fully to the right and bottom boundaries of the grid, respectively.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify all pixels in the `input_grid` that are not white (value 0). Record their row index `r`, column index `c`, and color value `C`.\n3.  Create a list of these non-white pixels. Sort this list first by row index `r` (ascending), and then by column index `c` (ascending) for pixels in the same row.\n4.  Get the `height` and `width` of the grid. Determine the index of the last column, `last_col = width - 1`.\n5.  Iterate through the sorted list of non-white pixels. For each pixel with original position (`r`, `c`) and color `C`:\n    a.  Draw the horizontal extension: For every column index `k` starting from `c + 1` up to and including `last_col`, set the color of the pixel at (`r`, `k`) in the `output_grid` to `C`.\n    b.  Draw the vertical extension: For every row index `j` starting from `r + 1` up to and including `height - 1`, set the color of the pixel at (`j`, `last_col`) in the `output_grid` to `C`.\n6.  The final `output_grid` is the result of the transformation."
