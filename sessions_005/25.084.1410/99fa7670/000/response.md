Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids are sparsely populated. They contain mostly white background pixels (0) and a few isolated non-white pixels. These non-white pixels can be considered distinct objects.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the original non-white pixels from the input. Additionally, new pixels are added, forming extensions from the original pixels.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** For each non-white pixel in the input, two lines of the same color are drawn in the output:
    *   A horizontal line starting from the column immediately to the right of the original pixel and extending all the way to the right edge of the grid, in the same row as the original pixel.
    *   A vertical line starting from the row immediately below the original pixel and extending all the way to the bottom edge of the grid. This vertical line is drawn in the *last column* of the grid.
4.  **Object Interaction/Overwriting:** When these drawn lines from different source pixels overlap, or overlap with an original pixel from a different source, the color of the pixel processed *later* overwrites the previous color. The processing order appears to be based on the original position of the source pixels: top-to-bottom, then left-to-right.
5.  **Grid Boundaries:** The extensions (lines) always extend fully to the right and bottom boundaries of the grid, respectively.

## Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - dimensions: height and width (variable, up to 30x30)
      - background_color: white (0)

  - item: Objects
    description: Isolated non-white pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: Integer value 1-9
      - position: row and column index (r, c)
    relationships:
      - Objects are processed independently but their transformations can interact via overwriting.
      - Processing order: Determined by original position (top-to-bottom row index, then left-to-right column index).

  - item: Transformation
    description: Process applied to each input object to generate the output.
    actions:
      - Initialize: Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
      - Identify: Find all non-white pixels in the input grid and their (row, col, color).
      - Sort: Order the identified pixels by row, then by column.
      - For each pixel (r, c) with color C in sorted order:
          - Draw Horizontal Line: For each column `k` from `c + 1` to `width - 1`, set `output[r, k] = C`.
          - Draw Vertical Line: For each row `j` from `r + 1` to `height - 1`, set `output[j, width - 1] = C`.
    properties:
      - Overwriting: Later drawing actions overwrite previous pixel values in the output grid.
      - Boundary-dependent: Lines extend to the right and bottom edges of the grid. The vertical line's column is always the last column (`width - 1`).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid called `output_grid` which is an exact copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Identify all pixels in the `input_grid` that are not white (value 0). Record their row index `r`, column index `c`, and color value `C`.
3.  Create a list of these non-white pixels. Sort this list first by row index `r` (ascending), and then by column index `c` (ascending) for pixels in the same row.
4.  Get the `height` and `width` of the grid. Determine the index of the last column, `last_col = width - 1`.
5.  Iterate through the sorted list of non-white pixels. For each pixel with original position (`r`, `c`) and color `C`:
    a.  Draw the horizontal extension: For every column index `k` starting from `c + 1` up to and including `last_col`, set the color of the pixel at (`r`, `k`) in the `output_grid` to `C`.
    b.  Draw the vertical extension: For every row index `j` starting from `r + 1` up to and including `height - 1`, set the color of the pixel at (`j`, `last_col`) in the `output_grid` to `C`.
6.  The final `output_grid` is the result of the transformation.
