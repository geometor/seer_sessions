task_elements:
  - item: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - dimensions: height and width (variable, up to 30x30)
      - background_color: white (0)

  - item: Objects
    description: Isolated non-white pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: Integer value 1-9
      - position: row and column index (r, c)
    relationships:
      - Objects are processed independently but their transformations can interact via overwriting.
      - Processing order: Determined by original position (top-to-bottom row index, then left-to-right column index).

  - item: Transformation
    description: Process applied to each input object to generate the output.
    actions:
      - Initialize: Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
      - Identify: Find all non-white pixels in the input grid and their (row, col, color).
      - Sort: Order the identified pixels by row, then by column.
      - For each pixel (r, c) with color C in sorted order:
          - Draw Horizontal Line: For each column `k` from `c + 1` to `width - 1`, set `output[r, k] = C`.
          - Draw Vertical Line: For each row `j` from `r + 1` to `height - 1`, set `output[j, width - 1] = C`.
    properties:
      - Overwriting: Later drawing actions overwrite previous pixel values in the output grid.
      - Boundary-dependent: Lines extend to the right and bottom edges of the grid. The vertical line's column is always the last column (`width - 1`).
