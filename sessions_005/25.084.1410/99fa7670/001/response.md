"""
Processes an input grid to produce an output grid based on the following transformation rule:
1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Identify all non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input grid.
3. Sort these identified pixels first by their row index (top-to-bottom) and then by their column index (left-to-right).
4. For each sorted non-white pixel at position (r, c) with color C:
   a. Draw a horizontal line of color C starting from the column immediately to the right (c + 1) and extending to the right edge of the grid, within the same row r.
   b. Draw a vertical line of color C starting from the row immediately below (r + 1) and extending to the bottom edge of the grid, within the last column of the grid.
5. If drawing operations overlap, the color from the pixel processed later (according to the sort order) overwrites any previous color.
6. Return the modified grid.
