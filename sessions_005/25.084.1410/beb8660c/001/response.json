Identifies a fixed \"ground\" object (a horizontal line of azure color 8) at the bottom.\n2. Identifies all other non-white (0) objects as \"movable\".\n3. Calculates the rightmost column occupied by any part of any movable object.\n4. Shifts all movable objects horizontally to the right so that this rightmost edge aligns with the right edge of the grid.\n5. Simulates gravity: Each movable object, maintaining its horizontally shifted position, falls downwards until it rests on the ground or another previously settled movable object. Objects are processed from bottom to top to ensure correct stacking.\n6. Renders the final grid with the ground in its original position and the movable objects in their final settled positions.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid, colors_to_find, background_color=0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous objects of specified colors in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        colors_to_find (set): A set of color values to search for.\n        background_color (int): The color considered as background.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of dictionaries, each representing an object with\n              'color' and 'pixels' (a set of (row, col) tuples).\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            color = grid[r, c]\n            if color != background_color and color in colors_to_find and not visited[r, c]:\n                obj_pixels = set()\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                obj_color = color\n\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    obj_pixels.add((row, col))\n\n                    # Check neighbors (4-connectivity: up, down, left, right)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and \\\n                           not visited[nr, nc] and grid[nr, nc] == obj_color:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                \n                if obj_pixels:\n                     # Sort pixels for consistent ordering/comparison if needed, though set is fine\n                     # sorted_pixels = sorted(list(obj_pixels)) \n                     objects.append({'color': obj_color, 'pixels': obj_pixels})\n\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the right-alignment and gravity simulation transformation.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n    background_color = 0\n    ground_color = 8\n    movable_colors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9} # Exclude background (0) and ground (8)\n\n    # Initialize output grid with background color\n    output_grid = np.full_like(input_np, background_color)\n\n    # Find and place the ground object (if any)\n    ground_objects = find_objects(input_np, {ground_color})\n    ground_pixels = set()\n    if ground_objects:\n        # Assuming only one ground object as per description\n        ground_pixels = ground_objects[0]['pixels']\n        for r, c in ground_pixels:\n             if 0 <= r < height and 0 <= c < width: # Bounds check just in case\n                output_grid[r, c] = ground_color\n\n    # Find movable objects\n    movable_objects = find_objects(input_np, movable_colors)\n\n    if not movable_objects:\n        # If no movable objects, return the grid with just the ground\n        return output_grid.tolist()\n\n    # --- Right Alignment ---\n    # Find the maximum column index occupied by any movable object\n    max_col_movable = -1\n    for obj in movable_objects:\n        for _, c in obj['pixels']:\n            max_col_movable = max(max_col_movable, c)\n\n    # Calculate the horizontal shift needed\n    grid_max_col = width -
