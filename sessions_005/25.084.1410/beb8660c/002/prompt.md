Previous Code:
```python
import numpy as np
from collections import deque

"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
1. Identifies a fixed "ground" object (a horizontal line of azure color 8) at the bottom.
2. Identifies all other non-white (0) objects as "movable".
3. Calculates the rightmost column occupied by any part of any movable object.
4. Shifts all movable objects horizontally to the right so that this rightmost edge aligns with the right edge of the grid.
5. Simulates gravity: Each movable object, maintaining its horizontally shifted position, falls downwards until it rests on the ground or another previously settled movable object. Objects are processed from bottom to top to ensure correct stacking.
6. Renders the final grid with the ground in its original position and the movable objects in their final settled positions.
