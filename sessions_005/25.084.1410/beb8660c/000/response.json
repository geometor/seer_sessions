This line acts as a stable base or \"ground\".\n    *   The other objects (blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta) appear to be positioned above this azure line.\n    *   In the output grids, the azure line remains unchanged in its position.\n    *   The other objects are rearranged. They appear to have moved downwards and rightwards.\n    *   The objects seem to undergo a \"gravity\" effect, falling downwards until they encounter either the azure line or another object that has already settled.\n    *   There's also a consistent rightward shift. The entire collection of non-azure, non-white objects seems to shift as a group so that the rightmost pixel among them aligns with the right edge of the grid *before* the gravity effect takes place.\n    *   Objects stack vertically upon each other or the azure line, maintaining their relative horizontal positions after the initial rightward shift.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Identify the horizontal line of `azure` (8) pixels at the bottom row. This is the \"ground\". Copy the ground to its same position in the output grid.\n    3.  Identify all other distinct, contiguous objects (pixels with colors 1-7, 9) in the input grid. These are the \"movable objects\".\n    4.  Determine the maximum column index (`max_col_movable`) occupied by any pixel of any movable object in the input grid.\n    5.  Determine the maximum column index of the grid (`grid_max_col`).\n    6.  Calculate the horizontal shift required: `shift = grid_max_col - max_col_movable`.\n    7.  Create a temporary representation of the movable objects, shifting each object's horizontal coordinates by `shift` columns to the right.\n    8.  Simulate gravity vertically for the shifted movable objects:\n        *   Process the objects row by row from bottom to top (or process objects based on their lowest initial row).\n        *   For each object, determine its target resting row by finding the highest occupied row below its lowest pixel (either the ground row or the top row of an already placed object in the same columns).\n        *   Move the object straight down so its lowest pixels are just above the determined resting row. Place the object's pixels onto the output grid. Mark these positions as occupied for subsequent object placement.\n    9.  Ensure that objects maintain their shape and relative horizontal positions (as determined after the initial rightward shift) during the downward movement.\n    10. The final output grid contains the unchanged ground and the movable objects settled in their new positions after the right-alignment and gravity simulation."
