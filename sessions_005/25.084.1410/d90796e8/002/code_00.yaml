Task: Identify and transform pairs of Green and Red pixels based on adjacency.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of integer color codes.
  - Colors:
    - Green: 3
    - Red: 2
    - Azure: 8
    - White: 0
    - Other colors (e.g., 5 Gray, 0 White) act as background/obstacles and are unchanged unless they are part of a Red transformation.

Objects:
  - Green_Pixel: A pixel with value 3.
  - Red_Pixel: A pixel with value 2.

Relationships:
  - Cardinal_Adjacency: Two pixels are cardinally adjacent if they share an edge (horizontally or vertically). Diagonal adjacency does not count for this transformation.

Actions:
  - Identify_Pairs: Find all instances where a Green_Pixel is cardinally adjacent to a Red_Pixel.
  - Transform_Pair: For each identified pair:
      - Change the Green_Pixel to Azure (8).
      - Change the Red_Pixel to White (0).
  - Preserve_Others: All pixels not part of such a cardinally adjacent Green-Red pair remain unchanged.

Execution_Constraint:
  - The transformation decision for each pixel is based on the *initial* state of the input grid. Changes are applied simultaneously (or effectively simultaneously by recording pairs first). A Red pixel changed to White cannot subsequently trigger a transformation with another Green pixel, and vice versa.
