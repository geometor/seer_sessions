Task: Transform grid based on local interactions between specific colors.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: A 2D array of pixels with integer color codes (0-9).
  - Relevant_Colors:
    - Green: 3
    - Red: 2
    - Azure: 8 (output color)
    - White: 0 (output color, also background)
  - Other_Colors: Pixels with colors other than Green(3) or Red(2) are generally static unless transformed from Red.

Objects:
  - Green_Pixel: A pixel with value 3.
  - Red_Pixel: A pixel with value 2.

Relationships:
  - Cardinal_Adjacency: Defines the interaction trigger. Two pixels are cardinally adjacent if they share a side (i.e., differ by exactly 1 in one coordinate dimension and 0 in the other). Diagonal adjacency is ignored.

Actions:
  - Identify_Interaction: Locate all pairs where a Green_Pixel is cardinally adjacent to a Red_Pixel in the input grid.
  - Transform_Pair: For each identified interacting pair:
      1. Change the Green_Pixel to Azure (8).
      2. Change the Red_Pixel to White (0).
  - Preserve_State: Pixels not involved in a cardinal Green-Red interaction retain their original color.

Execution_Constraints:
  - Simultaneity: All transformations are determined based on the initial input grid configuration. The result of one transformation does not affect the identification of other pairs within the same step.
