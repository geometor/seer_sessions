"""
Identifies pairs of adjacent Green(3) and Red(2) pixels (including diagonals) in the input grid. 
For each identified pair, the Green(3) pixel is changed to Azure(8) and the Red(2) pixel is changed to White(0) in the output grid. 
Pixels not involved in such a pair remain unchanged. Changes are applied based on the initial state of the grid.
