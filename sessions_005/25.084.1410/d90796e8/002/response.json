After checking all Green pixels and their cardinal Red neighbors and marking the intended changes, return the modified output grid. Ensure that changes are based on the original adjacencies, not intermediate states if multiple pairs exist. (The previous code's strategy of finding all pairs first and then applying changes achieves this).Okay, let's refine our understanding based on the results.\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the core interaction: Green(3) pixels adjacent to Red(2) pixels trigger a transformation where Green becomes Azure(8) and Red becomes White(0). However, the definition of \"adjacent\" was too broad. The failure in Example 3 demonstrates that only **cardinal adjacency** (up, down, left, right) triggers the transformation, while diagonal adjacency does not. The strategy is to update the definition of adjacency used in the transformation logic.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nThe analysis relies on identifying Green(3) and Red(2) pixels and their adjacency relationships.\n\n"
