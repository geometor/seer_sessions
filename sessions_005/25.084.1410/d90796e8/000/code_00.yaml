task_description: Identify adjacent pairs of Green(3) and Red(2) pixels and transform them.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 2
  - cell_values: integers 0-9 representing colors
  - size: variable (up to 30x30)
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value (0-9)
      - position: (row, column) coordinate
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    definition: Pixels sharing a side or a corner (8 neighbors).
    involved_objects: [pixel, pixel]
transformation_rule:
  - condition: A Green(3) pixel is adjacent (8-way) to a Red(2) pixel.
  - action_on_green: Change the Green(3) pixel to Azure(8).
  - action_on_red: Change the adjacent Red(2) pixel to White(0).
  - scope: Apply to all identified adjacent Green(3)-Red(2) pairs simultaneously.
unchanged_elements:
  - Pixels not part of an adjacent Green(3)-Red(2) pair retain their original color.
  - Pixels involved in the transformation but not Green(3) or Red(2) are not directly mentioned, but examples show other colors (e.g., Gray(5)) remain unchanged even if adjacent to the transforming pair.
