            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels. The grid sizes vary between examples.\n2.  **Colors Involved:** The key colors seem to be Green (3), Red (2), Azure (8), and White (0). Other colors like Gray (5) appear but remain unchanged.\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation modifies specific pixels based on their color and the color of their neighbors.\n4.  **Observed Change:** In all examples, some Green (3) pixels change to Azure (8), and some Red (2) pixels change to White (0).\n5.  **Spatial Relationship:** The changes consistently involve pairs of Green (3) and Red (2) pixels that are adjacent to each other. Adjacency includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors (all 8 surrounding cells).\n6.  **Rule:** When a Green (3) pixel has a Red (2) pixel as one of its 8 neighbors, the Green pixel becomes Azure (8) and the adjacent Red pixel becomes White (0). This happens for all such pairs found in the grid.\n7.  **Independence:** Each Green-Red adjacent pair seems to trigger the transformation independently. Pixels not involved in such a pair remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
