"""
Identifies the contiguous block of non-white rows starting from the top row 
(row index 0) of the input grid. Let the height of this block be H.
Creates an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
Then, for each row `i` (from 0 to H-1) in the identified top block of the input grid, 
copies the contents of that input row to the row at index `(GridHeight - 1 - i)` 
in the output grid, effectively creating a vertical reflection of the top block 
at the bottom of the grid.
