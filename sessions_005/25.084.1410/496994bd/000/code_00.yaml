task_context:
  grid_dimensions:
    - input_height: 10
    - input_width: variable (5 in example 1, 3 in example 2)
    - output_height: same as input_height
    - output_width: same as input_width
  colors_present: [white (0), red (2), green (3), azure (8)] # Based on examples, others might appear

identified_objects:
  - object_type: horizontal_row_block
    location: top of the input grid
    description: A contiguous block of one or more rows starting from the first row (row 0), where each row consists of a single, non-white color.
    properties:
      - height: number of rows in the block
      - rows: list of rows, each containing pixel data (color values)

actions_on_objects:
  - action: identify
    target: the top non-white horizontal_row_block in the input grid
  - action: copy
    source: the identified top block
    destination: same location in the output grid
  - action: reflect
    target: the identified top block
    axis: horizontal (across the grid's vertical center)
    description: The order of rows within the block is reversed.
  - action: place
    source: the reflected block
    destination: the bottom of the output grid, aligned such that the last row of the input corresponds to the first row of the reflected block, the second-to-last row to the second row, and so on.

relationships:
  - type: spatial_reflection
    description: The block of rows appearing at the bottom of the output grid is a vertical reflection of the block of rows at the top of the input grid.
  - type: preservation
    description: The original top block from the input grid is preserved in the same location in the output grid.
  - type: background_fill
    description: All rows in the output grid that are not part of the original top block or the reflected bottom block are filled with white (0).
