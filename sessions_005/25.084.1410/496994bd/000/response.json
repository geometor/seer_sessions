            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n## Perception of Task Elements\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are grids of pixels (represented by numbers 0-9). The examples use grids of size 10x5 and 10x3.\n2.  **Colors Used:** The examples use white (0), red (2), green (3), and azure (8).\n3.  **Input Pattern:** In both examples, the input grid has a block of one or more non-white, uniformly colored horizontal rows at the very top. The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels.\n4.  **Output Pattern:** The output grid retains the original colored rows at the top. Additionally, a vertically flipped version of this top block appears at the very bottom of the grid. The rows between the top block and the bottom (reflected) block remain white.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be identifying the contiguous block of non-white rows at the top of the input grid and reflecting this block vertically across the horizontal midline of the grid, placing the reflected image at the bottom while keeping the original top block intact.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
