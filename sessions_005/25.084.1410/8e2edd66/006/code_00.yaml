task_description: Scales the input grid by 3x and applies a pattern based on pixel color.
grid_properties:
  scaling_factor: 3
  output_size: input_size * 3
input_pixel_processing:
  - condition: pixel color is white (0)
    action:
      - identify unique non-white color (C) from the entire input grid.
      - locate corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid (top-left at r*3, c*3).
      - place color C at specific relative coordinates within the block.
    pattern_relative_coords: [[0, 2], [1, 0], [2, 0], [2, 2]]
    output_block_background: white (0)
  - condition: pixel color is non-white
    action:
      - locate corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid.
      - leave the entire block white (0).
assumptions:
  - Each input grid contains exactly one non-white color.
