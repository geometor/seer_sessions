Examples:
  - Input_Grid: 3x3
    Output_Grid: 9x9 (3x scaling)
    Input_Pixels:
      - Type: Cell
        Location: (r, c)
        Value: Color (0-9)
    Output_Pixels:
      - Type: Block (3x3)
        Location: (r*3, c*3) to (r*3+2, c*3+2)
        Determined_By: Input Pixel at (r, c)
    Actions:
      - Action: Map_Pixel_To_Block
        Input: Pixel at (r, c) with value V
        Output: 3x3 Block at (r*3, c*3)
        Rule:
          - If V is 0 (white): Output Block is all 0 (white).
          - If V is non-zero (color X):
              - Initialize Output Block as all 0 (white).
              - Set pixel at relative coordinate (1, 2) within the block to X.
              - Set pixel at relative coordinate (2, 1) within the block to X.
              - (Absolute coordinates: `output[r*3 + 1, c*3 + 2] = X`, `output[r*3 + 2, c*3 + 1] = X`)
