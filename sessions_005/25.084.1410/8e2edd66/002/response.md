**General Assessment**

The previous code failed because the core assumption about the transformation was incorrect. It assumed that each non-white pixel in the input caused the *entire* input grid to be copied into the corresponding 3x3 output block. The results clearly show this is not the case.

Instead, the relationship is more localized: each input pixel dictates the content of a specific 3x3 block in the output grid. White input pixels map to all-white output blocks. Non-white input pixels map to a specific 3x3 pattern using the input pixel's color.

The strategy will be to:
1.  Re-analyze the mapping from input pixel coordinates and color to the 3x3 output block content.
2.  Identify the consistent pattern applied for non-white input pixels.
3.  Update the natural language program and facts to reflect this new understanding.

**Metrics**

Let's examine the structure and differences more closely.

*   **Input/Output Dimensions:** All examples have a 3x3 input and a 9x9 output. This confirms the 3x scaling factor.
*   **Pixel Mapping Rule:**
    *   Input `(r, c)` maps to output block starting at `(r*3, c*3)`.
    *   If `input[r, c] == 0` (white), then `output[r*3 : r*3+3, c*3 : c*3+3]` is all white (0).
    *   If `input[r, c] == X` (where `X != 0`), let's look at the pattern in the `Expected Output` blocks:
        *   **Example 1 (Color 8):** For input `(0,0)` (value 8), the output block `(0:3, 0:3)` is `[[0,0,0], [0,0,8], [0,8,0]]`.
        *   **Example 2 (Color 9):** For input `(0,0)` (value 9), the output block `(0:3, 0:3)` is `[[0,0,0], [0,0,9], [0,9,0]]`.
        *   **Example 3 (Color 7):** For input `(0,0)` (value 7), the output block `(0:3, 0:3)` is `[[0,0,0], [0,0,7], [0,7,0]]`.
    *   The pattern for a non-white input pixel `X` at `(r, c)` appears to be: place `X` at relative coordinates `(1, 2)` and `(2, 1)` within the 3x3 output block starting at `(r*3, c*3)`. All other cells in the block are white (0).
*   **Code Failure Analysis:** The previous code placed the *entire input grid* into the 3x3 block for non-white inputs. This resulted in many incorrect pixels. For Example 1, the expected output has 10 non-white pixels, while the transformed output has 40. This large discrepancy aligns with the observed pattern mismatch. Similar discrepancies exist for Examples 2 and 3.

**Facts**


```yaml
Examples:
  - Input_Grid: 3x3
    Output_Grid: 9x9 (3x scaling)
    Input_Pixels:
      - Type: Cell
        Location: (r, c)
        Value: Color (0-9)
    Output_Pixels:
      - Type: Block (3x3)
        Location: (r*3, c*3) to (r*3+2, c*3+2)
        Determined_By: Input Pixel at (r, c)
    Actions:
      - Action: Map_Pixel_To_Block
        Input: Pixel at (r, c) with value V
        Output: 3x3 Block at (r*3, c*3)
        Rule:
          - If V is 0 (white): Output Block is all 0 (white).
          - If V is non-zero (color X):
              - Initialize Output Block as all 0 (white).
              - Set pixel at relative coordinate (1, 2) within the block to X.
              - Set pixel at relative coordinate (2, 1) within the block to X.
              - (Absolute coordinates: `output[r*3 + 1, c*3 + 2] = X`, `output[r*3 + 2, c*3 + 1] = X`)
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the dimensions of the input grid (height `H`, width `W`).
2.  Create an output grid with dimensions (`H` * 3, `W` * 3), initialized with the white color (0).
3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at coordinates (`r`, `c`), where `r` is the row index and `c` is the column index.
4.  Get the color value `X` of the input pixel at (`r`, `c`).
5.  If the input pixel color `X` is *not* white (i.e., `X != 0`):
    a.  Calculate the coordinates of two specific pixels within the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid:
        i.  Pixel 1: (`r` * 3 + 1, `c` * 3 + 2)
        ii. Pixel 2: (`r` * 3 + 2, `c` * 3 + 1)
    b.  Set the color of these two output pixels to `X`.
6.  (Implicitly) If the input pixel color `X` *is* white (0), the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid remains all white, as initialized.
7.  Return the completed output grid.
