  - description: Input Grid
    properties:
      - height: variable
      - width: variable
      - contains:
          - element: Background
            count: 1
            properties:
              - type: dominant color area
          - element: Lines
            count: 2 (1 horizontal, 1 vertical)
            properties:
              - type: single color, different from background
              - spans: full width (horizontal), full height (vertical)
              - intersection: defines 4 quadrants
          - element: Unique Pixel
            count: 1
            properties:
              - type: single pixel
              - color: different from background and lines
              - location: within one of the 4 quadrants defined by lines

  - description: Output Grid
    properties:
      - is_subgrid_of: Input Grid
      - corresponds_to: One of the four quadrants of the Input Grid

relationships:
  - type: selection
    source: Unique Pixel location relative to Line Intersection
    target: Output Grid quadrant
    rule: The quadrant containing the Unique Pixel determines the subgrid extracted for the output.

transformation:
  - step: Identify the horizontal and vertical lines and their intersection point (R, C).
  - step: Identify the location (r, c) of the Unique Pixel.
  - step: Determine the quadrant based on (r, c) relative to (R, C).
  - step: Extract the subgrid corresponding to that quadrant, excluding the lines themselves.
