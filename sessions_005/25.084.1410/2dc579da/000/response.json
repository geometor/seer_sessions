These lines intersect at a single point.\n2.  **Background Color:** The grids have a predominant background color, different from the line color.\n3.  **Unique Pixel:** Each input grid contains exactly one pixel whose color is different from both the background color and the line color.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is always a rectangular subgrid of the input grid.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The intersection point of the horizontal and vertical lines effectively divides the input grid into four quadrants. The location of the unique pixel (relative to the intersection point) determines which of these four quadrants is selected as the output grid. The lines themselves are not included in the output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
