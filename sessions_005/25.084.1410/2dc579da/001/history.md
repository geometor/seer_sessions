Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Each input grid contains exactly one horizontal line and exactly one vertical line of the same color, which span the entire width and height of the grid, respectively. These lines intersect at a single point.
2.  **Background Color:** The grids have a predominant background color, different from the line color.
3.  **Unique Pixel:** Each input grid contains exactly one pixel whose color is different from both the background color and the line color.
4.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is always a rectangular subgrid of the input grid.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The intersection point of the horizontal and vertical lines effectively divides the input grid into four quadrants. The location of the unique pixel (relative to the intersection point) determines which of these four quadrants is selected as the output grid. The lines themselves are not included in the output.

              - color: different from background and lines
              - location: within one of the 4 quadrants defined by lines

  - description: Output Grid
    properties:
      - is_subgrid_of: Input Grid
      - corresponds_to: One of the four quadrants of the Input Grid

relationships:
  - type: selection
    source: Unique Pixel location relative to Line Intersection
    target: Output Grid quadrant
    rule: The quadrant containing the Unique Pixel determines the subgrid extracted for the output.

transformation:
  - step: Identify the horizontal and vertical lines and their intersection point (R, C).
  - step: Identify the location (r, c) of the Unique Pixel.
  - step: Determine the quadrant based on (r, c) relative to (R, C).
  - step: Extract the subgrid corresponding to that quadrant, excluding the lines themselves.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Find the color, row index `R`, and column index `C` of the single horizontal and vertical lines that cross the entire grid.
2.  Identify the coordinates `(r, c)` of the single pixel whose color is neither the background color nor the line color.
3.  Compare the unique pixel's coordinates `(r, c)` with the intersection coordinates `(R, C)` to determine which quadrant it lies in:
    *   If `r < R` and `c < C`, select the Top-Left quadrant.
    *   If `r < R` and `c > C`, select the Top-Right quadrant.
    *   If `r > R` and `c < C`, select the Bottom-Left quadrant.
    *   If `r > R` and `c > C`, select the Bottom-Right quadrant.
4.  Extract the subgrid from the input corresponding to the selected quadrant, excluding the dividing lines:
    *   Top-Left: Extract the region from row 0 to `R-1` and column 0 to `C-1`.
    *   Top-Right: Extract the region from row 0 to `R-1` and column `C+1` to the last column.
    *   Bottom-Left: Extract the region from row `R+1` to the last row and column 0 to `C-1`.
    *   Bottom-Right: Extract the region from row `R+1` to the last row and column `C+1` to the last column.
5.  The extracted subgrid is the final output.
