"""
Find the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the input grid. These lines have the same color and are different from the background color. Locate the single pixel with a color different from both the background and the lines. Determine which of the four quadrants (defined by the intersection of the lines) contains this unique pixel. Extract this quadrant, excluding the lines themselves, as the output grid.
