- task: count_elements_and_adjust
- description: Transform an input grid into a single column output grid filled with white pixels. The height of the output grid is determined by the number of distinct connected components of gray pixels in the input grid, plus one.
- input:
    - objects:
        - type: grid
        - properties: contains pixels of various colors (0-9).
        - objects_of_interest:
            - type: pixel
            - color: gray (5)
            - grouping: connected components (using either 4-way cardinal or 8-way diagonal adjacency - results are identical for examples provided).
- output:
    - objects:
        - type: grid
        - properties:
            - width: 1
            - height: N + 1, where N is the number of gray connected components in the input.
            - color: all pixels are white (0).
- transformation:
    - step 1: Identify all distinct groups (connected components) of gray (5) pixels within the input grid. Connectivity can be defined as either cardinal (4-way) or diagonal (8-way), as both yield the same count for the provided examples.
    - step 2: Count the total number of these separate gray components found (N).
    - step 3: Calculate the output grid height as N + 1.
    - step 4: Construct the output grid with dimensions (N + 1) rows and 1 column.
    - step 5: Fill the entire output grid with the white (0) color.
