The input grids feature various arrangements of gray pixels, sometimes forming distinct connected shapes or clusters. The output grids are consistently simple vertical columns of white (0) pixels. The height of the output column appears to vary based on the input grid.\n\nBy examining the examples:\n-   **train_1:** The input has three distinct groups of connected gray pixels. The output is a 3x1 column of white pixels.\n-   **train_2:** The input has two distinct groups of connected gray pixels. The output is a 2x1 column of white pixels.\n-   **train_3:** The input has five distinct groups of connected gray pixels. The output is a 5x1 column of white pixels.\n-   **train_4:** The input has four distinct groups of connected gray pixels. The output is a 4x1 column of white pixels.\n\nThe core pattern seems to be identifying and counting the number of connected components (objects) formed by the gray pixels in the input grid. The output grid's height is determined by this count, and its width is always 1. All pixels in the output grid are white (0).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
