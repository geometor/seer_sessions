elements:
  - type: grid
    role: input
    content: 2D array of pixels
    pixels:
      - color: white (0)
        role: background
      - color: gray (5)
        role: foreground, forms objects
  - type: grid
    role: output
    content: 2D array of pixels
    pixels:
      - color: white (0)
    properties:
      - width is always 1
      - height varies based on input

objects:
  - type: connected_component
    description: A contiguous group of gray (5) pixels where connectivity is defined by horizontal and vertical adjacency (not diagonal).
    source: input grid
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - count: The number of distinct connected components in the input grid.

transformation:
  - action: identify_objects
    input: input grid
    target_color: gray (5)
    connectivity: cardinal (horizontal/vertical)
    output: set of distinct gray connected components
  - action: count_objects
    input: set of distinct gray connected components
    output: integer N (the count)
  - action: create_output_grid
    properties:
      height: N (the count from the previous step)
      width: 1
      fill_color: white (0)
    output: final output grid

relationship:
  - The height of the output grid is equal to the number of distinct connected gray objects found in the input grid.
