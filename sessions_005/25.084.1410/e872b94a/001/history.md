## Perception

The task involves transforming an input grid containing gray (5) and white (0) pixels into an output grid. The input grids feature various arrangements of gray pixels, sometimes forming distinct connected shapes or clusters. The output grids are consistently simple vertical columns of white (0) pixels. The height of the output column appears to vary based on the input grid.

By examining the examples:
-   **train_1:** The input has three distinct groups of connected gray pixels. The output is a 3x1 column of white pixels.
-   **train_2:** The input has two distinct groups of connected gray pixels. The output is a 2x1 column of white pixels.
-   **train_3:** The input has five distinct groups of connected gray pixels. The output is a 5x1 column of white pixels.
-   **train_4:** The input has four distinct groups of connected gray pixels. The output is a 4x1 column of white pixels.

The core pattern seems to be identifying and counting the number of connected components (objects) formed by the gray pixels in the input grid. The output grid's height is determined by this count, and its width is always 1. All pixels in the output grid are white (0).

## Facts


```yaml
elements:
  - type: grid
    role: input
    content: 2D array of pixels
    pixels:
      - color: white (0)
        role: background
      - color: gray (5)
        role: foreground, forms objects
  - type: grid
    role: output
    content: 2D array of pixels
    pixels:
      - color: white (0)
    properties:
      - width is always 1
      - height varies based on input

objects:
  - type: connected_component
    description: A contiguous group of gray (5) pixels where connectivity is defined by horizontal and vertical adjacency (not diagonal).
    source: input grid
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - count: The number of distinct connected components in the input grid.

transformation:
  - action: identify_objects
    input: input grid
    target_color: gray (5)
    connectivity: cardinal (horizontal/vertical)
    output: set of distinct gray connected components
  - action: count_objects
    input: set of distinct gray connected components
    output: integer N (the count)
  - action: create_output_grid
    properties:
      height: N (the count from the previous step)
      width: 1
      fill_color: white (0)
    output: final output grid

relationship:
  - The height of the output grid is equal to the number of distinct connected gray objects found in the input grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all distinct connected components (objects) formed by gray (5) pixels in the input grid. Consider pixels connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically.
2.  Count the total number (N) of these distinct gray objects.
3.  Create a new output grid with dimensions N rows x 1 column.
4.  Fill all pixels in the output grid with the color white (0).
