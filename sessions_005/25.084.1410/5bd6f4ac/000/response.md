*   **Perception:** The task involves extracting a specific 3x3 subgrid from a larger 9x9 input grid. The location of this subgrid appears fixed across all provided examples. The content of the cells within the subgrid is directly copied to the output grid without modification.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: extraction
    input_grid_properties:
      - dimensions: 9x9 (constant across examples)
    output_grid_properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (constant across examples)
    transformation:
      - type: subgrid_extraction
      - source_location: Top-right corner of the input grid
      - source_coordinates:
          top_row: 0
          left_col: 6
          bottom_row: 2
          right_col: 8
      - content_mapping: direct copy (identity transformation)
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Given a 9x9 input grid.
    2.  Select the rectangular region (subgrid) defined by the rows from 0 to 2 (inclusive) and columns from 6 to 8 (inclusive).
    3.  Return this selected 3x3 subgrid as the output.
