  description: "Compares two subgrids defined by a central divider and outputs a pattern based on matching white pixels."
  input_grid_size: [5, 7]
  output_grid_size: [5, 3]
  input_colors: [0, 1, 9]  # white, blue, maroon
  output_colors: [0, 8]   # white, azure

elements:
  - object: divider
    type: line
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
      orientation: vertical
      location: column index 3
      function: Separates the input grid into left and right subgrids.
  - object: left_subgrid
    type: grid_section
    properties:
      location: columns 0-2
      size: [5, 3]
      content_colors: [white (0), maroon (9)]
  - object: right_subgrid
    type: grid_section
    properties:
      location: columns 4-6
      size: [5, 3]
      content_colors: [white (0), maroon (9)]

    type: grid
    properties:
      size: [5, 3]
      content_colors: [white (0), azure (8)]

transformation:
  operation: "pixel-wise comparison and conditional mapping"
  steps:
    - "Identify the vertical blue divider line (column 3)."
    - "Define the left subgrid (columns 0-2) and the right subgrid (columns 4-6)."
    - "Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the subgrids (5x3)."
    - "Iterate through each cell position (row r, column c) within the 5x3 dimensions."
    - "Compare the pixel value at input[r, c] (left subgrid) with input[r, c + 4] (right subgrid)."
    - "If input[r, c] == input[r, c + 4] AND input[r, c] == 0 (white):"
      - "Set the output grid pixel at output[r, c] to 8 (azure)."
    - "Otherwise (pixels are different, or pixels are both maroon):"
      - "Set the output grid pixel at output[r, c] to 0 (white)."
