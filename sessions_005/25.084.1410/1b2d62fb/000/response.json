            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** All input examples are 5x7 grids. They consistently feature a vertical blue (1) line in the 4th column (index 3). The remaining pixels are either white (0) or maroon (9).\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** All output examples are 5x3 grids. They contain only white (0) and azure (8) pixels.\n3.  **Relationship:** The blue line in the input acts as a separator, dividing the grid into a 5x3 left section (columns 0-2) and a 5x3 right section (columns 4-6). The output grid's dimensions (5x3) match the dimensions of these left and right sections.\n4.  **Transformation Core Logic:** The output grid seems to be generated by comparing the pixels in the left section with the pixels in the corresponding positions in the right section. Specifically, an azure (8) pixel appears in the output only when the corresponding pixels in both the left and right input sections are identical *and* are white (0). In all other comparison cases (different pixels, or identical pixels that are maroon), the output pixel is white (0).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
