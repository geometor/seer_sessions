            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of pixels represented by integers 0-9 (colors). The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output for each example.\n2.  **Color Preservation:** Pixels that are *not* white (color 0) in the input seem to retain their original color and position in the output grid. This is observed for red (2), green (3), azure (8), and magenta (6) pixels across the examples.\n3.  **Color Transformation:** Some white pixels (color 0) in the input are changed to blue pixels (color 1) in the output. Not all white pixels change.\n4.  **Triggering Condition:** The transformation of white pixels to blue appears to be related to the presence of red pixels (color 2) in the input grid.\n5.  **Spatial Relationship:** The white pixels that turn blue are those located directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally - like a King's move in chess) to at least one red pixel in the input grid.\n6.  **Independence of Other Colors:** Other non-white colors (green, azure, magenta in the examples) do not seem to influence the transformation of white pixels to blue.\n7.  **Process:** The transformation identifies all red pixels first. Then, it examines each white pixel to see if it neighbors any of the identified red pixels. If a neighborhood relationship exists, the white pixel becomes blue; otherwise, it remains white.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
