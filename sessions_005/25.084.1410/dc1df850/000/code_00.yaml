Initial_State:
  - Grid: Input grid containing pixels of various colors (0-9).
  - Objects:
    - Pixels defined by color and position (row, column).
    - Key objects: Red pixels (color 2).
    - Affected objects: White pixels (color 0).
Transformations:
  - Action: Change color of specific pixels.
  - Source_Color: White (0).
  - Target_Color: Blue (1).
  - Condition:
    - Trigger: Presence of Red pixels (color 2) in the input grid.
    - Relationship: A White pixel (0) must be adjacent (8-connectivity: horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) to at least one Red pixel (2).
Final_State:
  - Grid: Output grid with the same dimensions as the input.
  - Pixels:
    - All non-white pixels from the input retain their original color and position.
    - White pixels adjacent to any input Red pixel are changed to Blue (1).
    - White pixels *not* adjacent to any input Red pixel remain White (0).
