Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of pixels represented by integers 0-9 (colors). The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output for each example.
2.  **Color Preservation:** Pixels that are *not* white (color 0) in the input seem to retain their original color and position in the output grid. This is observed for red (2), green (3), azure (8), and magenta (6) pixels across the examples.
3.  **Color Transformation:** Some white pixels (color 0) in the input are changed to blue pixels (color 1) in the output. Not all white pixels change.
4.  **Triggering Condition:** The transformation of white pixels to blue appears to be related to the presence of red pixels (color 2) in the input grid.
5.  **Spatial Relationship:** The white pixels that turn blue are those located directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally - like a King's move in chess) to at least one red pixel in the input grid.
6.  **Independence of Other Colors:** Other non-white colors (green, azure, magenta in the examples) do not seem to influence the transformation of white pixels to blue.
7.  **Process:** The transformation identifies all red pixels first. Then, it examines each white pixel to see if it neighbors any of the identified red pixels. If a neighborhood relationship exists, the white pixel becomes blue; otherwise, it remains white.

## Facts


```yaml
Initial_State:
  - Grid: Input grid containing pixels of various colors (0-9).
  - Objects:
    - Pixels defined by color and position (row, column).
    - Key objects: Red pixels (color 2).
    - Affected objects: White pixels (color 0).
Transformations:
  - Action: Change color of specific pixels.
  - Source_Color: White (0).
  - Target_Color: Blue (1).
  - Condition:
    - Trigger: Presence of Red pixels (color 2) in the input grid.
    - Relationship: A White pixel (0) must be adjacent (8-connectivity: horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) to at least one Red pixel (2).
Final_State:
  - Grid: Output grid with the same dimensions as the input.
  - Pixels:
    - All non-white pixels from the input retain their original color and position.
    - White pixels adjacent to any input Red pixel are changed to Blue (1).
    - White pixels *not* adjacent to any input Red pixel remain White (0).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the locations (row, column) of all pixels with the color Red (2) in the input grid. Store these locations.
3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
4.  For each pixel being iterated:
    a.  Check if the current pixel's color in the input grid is White (0).
    b.  If it is White (0), check if this pixel's location is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to *any* of the Red pixel locations identified in step 2.
    c.  If it is adjacent to at least one Red pixel, change the color of the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid to Blue (1).
5.  After iterating through all pixels, the resulting output grid is the final result.
