            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code implemented a flood fill originating from green pixels, converting adjacent orange pixels to green, treating azure pixels as barriers. However, the comparison with the expected outputs reveals that this flood fill is too extensive. The transformation appears to be constrained not just *by* azure barriers but *within* regions defined by these barriers (and grid edges). The green color only spreads within the specific enclosed area(s) that initially contain green pixels. Other enclosed orange areas, even if adjacent, remain unchanged.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the algorithm to first identify distinct regions demarcated by azure pixels and grid boundaries. Then, for each region, determine if it contains any initial green pixels. Only within regions containing initial green pixels should the orange pixels be converted to green.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's gather some metrics about the examples to verify the assumptions. We will count the occurrences of key colors (Green=3, Orange=7, Azure=8) in the input, expected output, and the (incorrect) transformed output from the previous attempt for each example.\n\n"
