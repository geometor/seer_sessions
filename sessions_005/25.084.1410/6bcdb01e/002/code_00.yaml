task_context:
  - The grid contains pixels of various colors, primarily green (3), orange (7), and azure (8).
  - Azure pixels and the grid boundaries act as static walls or barriers.
  - Green pixels are the source or trigger for a transformation.
  - Orange pixels are potentially transformable into green pixels.

objects:
  - walls:
      - Composed of azure (8) pixels and grid boundaries.
      - Property: Impassable, static.
      - Define enclosed regions within the grid.
  - regions:
      - Areas enclosed by walls.
      - Contain pixels of various colors (green, orange, others).
      - Property: Can be categorized based on whether they initially contain any green (3) pixels.
  - source_pixels:
      - Green (3) pixels in the input grid.
      - Property: Initiate the transformation within their respective region(s).
      - Remain green in the output.
  - target_pixels:
      - Orange (7) pixels in the input grid.
      - Property: Can be transformed into green pixels under specific conditions.

actions:
  - identify_regions:
      - Partition the grid into distinct regions based on the azure (8) walls and grid boundaries. Any contiguous area of non-azure pixels forms a region.
  - check_regions_for_source:
      - For each identified region, determine if it contains at least one green (3) pixel from the input grid.
  - transform_targets_in_source_regions:
      - For every region that contains at least one initial green (3) pixel:
          - Change the color of all orange (7) pixels located within that specific region to green (3).
  - retain_other_pixels:
      - Pixels that are not orange (7) within a source-containing region remain unchanged (including the initial green pixels).
      - All pixels within regions that do *not* contain any initial green (3) pixels remain unchanged.
      - Azure (8) pixels always remain unchanged.

transformation_rule: A region-based color conversion where orange pixels within an enclosed area turn green if, and only if, that area initially contains at least one green pixel. Azure pixels and grid edges define the enclosures.
