## General Assessment

The previous code implemented a flood fill originating from green pixels, converting adjacent orange pixels to green, treating azure pixels as barriers. However, the comparison with the expected outputs reveals that this flood fill is too extensive. The transformation appears to be constrained not just *by* azure barriers but *within* regions defined by these barriers (and grid edges). The green color only spreads within the specific enclosed area(s) that initially contain green pixels. Other enclosed orange areas, even if adjacent, remain unchanged.

The strategy is to refine the algorithm to first identify distinct regions demarcated by azure pixels and grid boundaries. Then, for each region, determine if it contains any initial green pixels. Only within regions containing initial green pixels should the orange pixels be converted to green.

## Metrics

Let's gather some metrics about the examples to verify the assumptions. We will count the occurrences of key colors (Green=3, Orange=7, Azure=8) in the input, expected output, and the (incorrect) transformed output from the previous attempt for each example.

```
The metrics confirm:
1.  Azure pixels act as static barriers; their positions and count remain unchanged in both expected and transformed outputs.
2.  The previous code incorrectly converted *all* orange pixels reachable from green pixels into green pixels, resulting in zero remaining orange pixels and a much higher green pixel count than expected.
3.  The expected output retains some orange pixels, indicating the conversion is selective.
4.  The number of differing pixels corresponds exactly to the `Pixels Off` reported previously.

This supports the hypothesis that the transformation is region-based: green spreads to orange only within enclosed regions (defined by azure and grid boundaries) that initially contain at least one green pixel.

## Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  - The grid contains pixels of various colors, primarily green (3), orange (7), and azure (8).
  - Azure pixels and the grid boundaries act as static walls or barriers.
  - Green pixels are the source or trigger for a transformation.
  - Orange pixels are potentially transformable into green pixels.

objects:
  - walls:
      - Composed of azure (8) pixels and grid boundaries.
      - Property: Impassable, static.
      - Define enclosed regions within the grid.
  - regions:
      - Areas enclosed by walls.
      - Contain pixels of various colors (green, orange, others).
      - Property: Can be categorized based on whether they initially contain any green (3) pixels.
  - source_pixels:
      - Green (3) pixels in the input grid.
      - Property: Initiate the transformation within their respective region(s).
      - Remain green in the output.
  - target_pixels:
      - Orange (7) pixels in the input grid.
      - Property: Can be transformed into green pixels under specific conditions.

actions:
  - identify_regions:
      - Partition the grid into distinct regions based on the azure (8) walls and grid boundaries. Any contiguous area of non-azure pixels forms a region.
  - check_regions_for_source:
      - For each identified region, determine if it contains at least one green (3) pixel from the input grid.
  - transform_targets_in_source_regions:
      - For every region that contains at least one initial green (3) pixel:
          - Change the color of all orange (7) pixels located within that specific region to green (3).
  - retain_other_pixels:
      - Pixels that are not orange (7) within a source-containing region remain unchanged (including the initial green pixels).
      - All pixels within regions that do *not* contain any initial green (3) pixels remain unchanged.
      - Azure (8) pixels always remain unchanged.

transformation_rule: A region-based color conversion where orange pixels within an enclosed area turn green if, and only if, that area initially contains at least one green pixel. Azure pixels and grid edges define the enclosures.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous regions of non-azure (8) pixels. Azure pixels and the grid boundaries serve as separators between regions. Use a method like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Flood Fill, keeping track of visited cells globally to ensure each non-azure pixel is assigned to exactly one region.
3.  For each identified region:
    a.  Check if any of the pixels within this region correspond to green (3) pixels in the *input* grid. Mark the region as "source-containing" if true.
    b.  Store the set of coordinates belonging to this region.
4.  Iterate through all identified regions again.
5.  If a region was marked as "source-containing":
    a.  Iterate through all the coordinates belonging to this specific region.
    b.  For each coordinate, check the color of the pixel at that position in the *input* grid.
    c.  If the input pixel color is orange (7), change the color of the pixel at the corresponding coordinate in the *output* grid to green (3).
6.  Return the modified output grid.
