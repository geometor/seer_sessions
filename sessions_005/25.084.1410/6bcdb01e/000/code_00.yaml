Initial_State:
  Grid:
    Type: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
    Size: Variable (e.g., 7x7, 5x5).
    Pixels:
      - Color: Green (3)
        Role: Seed/Source of transformation.
        Quantity: Few.
      - Color: Orange (7)
        Role: Fillable area.
        Quantity: Many (often background).
      - Color: Azure (8)
        Role: Barrier/Static element.
        Quantity: Some.
      - Other Colors: Not present in these examples, but potentially act as barriers if present.

Transformation:
  Action: Color Filling / Region Expansion.
  Trigger: Presence of initial Green (3) pixels.
  Target: Orange (7) pixels.
  Rule:
    1. Identify all initial Green (3) pixels.
    2. Identify all Orange (7) pixels that are reachable from any initial Green (3) pixel.
    3. Reachability is defined by a path consisting only of adjacent Orange (7) pixels. Adjacency includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors (8-connectivity).
    4. Azure (8) pixels and grid boundaries block the pathfinding/reachability.
  Outcome: All reachable Orange (7) pixels identified in step 2 are changed to Green (3).

Final_State:
  Grid:
    Size: Same as input.
    Pixels:
      - Color: Green (3)
        Locations: Original Green locations + locations of formerly Orange pixels that were reachable.
      - Color: Orange (7)
        Locations: Original Orange locations that were *not* reachable from initial Green pixels.
      - Color: Azure (8)
        Locations: Same as input.
      - Other Colors: Same as input (if any).
