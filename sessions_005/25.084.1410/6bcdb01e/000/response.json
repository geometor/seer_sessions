The background seems to be predominantly orange (7).\n3.  **Static Elements:** The positions of azure (8) pixels remain unchanged between the input and output grids.\n4.  **Dynamic Elements:** The green (3) pixels seem to be the \"source\" of change. In the output grid, the number and positions of green (3) pixels have increased compared to the input.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation appears to involve the green (3) pixels \"expanding\" or \"flooding\" into adjacent orange (7) pixels. This expansion seems to cover a connected area of orange pixels.\n6.  **Boundaries:** The expansion of green (3) pixels stops when it encounters an azure (8) pixel or the edge of the grid. Azure pixels act as barriers, preventing the green color from spreading through or past them.\n7.  **Connectivity:** The expansion seems to consider diagonal adjacency as well as horizontal and vertical adjacency (8-connectivity). An orange pixel changes to green if it is adjacent (including diagonally) to an existing green pixel (either an original one or one that has already been changed in the process) and is part of the same connected orange region accessible from the initial green pixels.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
