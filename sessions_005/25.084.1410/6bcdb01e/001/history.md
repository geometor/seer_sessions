**input:**

Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions.
2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved are green (3), orange (7), and azure (8). The background seems to be predominantly orange (7).
3.  **Static Elements:** The positions of azure (8) pixels remain unchanged between the input and output grids.
4.  **Dynamic Elements:** The green (3) pixels seem to be the "source" of change. In the output grid, the number and positions of green (3) pixels have increased compared to the input.
5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation appears to involve the green (3) pixels "expanding" or "flooding" into adjacent orange (7) pixels. This expansion seems to cover a connected area of orange pixels.
6.  **Boundaries:** The expansion of green (3) pixels stops when it encounters an azure (8) pixel or the edge of the grid. Azure pixels act as barriers, preventing the green color from spreading through or past them.
7.  **Connectivity:** The expansion seems to consider diagonal adjacency as well as horizontal and vertical adjacency (8-connectivity). An orange pixel changes to green if it is adjacent (including diagonally) to an existing green pixel (either an original one or one that has already been changed in the process) and is part of the same connected orange region accessible from the initial green pixels.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
Initial_State:
  Grid:
    Type: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
    Size: Variable (e.g., 7x7, 5x5).
    Pixels:
      - Color: Green (3)
        Role: Seed/Source of transformation.
        Quantity: Few.
      - Color: Orange (7)
        Role: Fillable area.
        Quantity: Many (often background).
      - Color: Azure (8)
        Role: Barrier/Static element.
        Quantity: Some.
      - Other Colors: Not present in these examples, but potentially act as barriers if present.

Transformation:
  Action: Color Filling / Region Expansion.
  Trigger: Presence of initial Green (3) pixels.
  Target: Orange (7) pixels.
  Rule:
    1. Identify all initial Green (3) pixels.
    2. Identify all Orange (7) pixels that are reachable from any initial Green (3) pixel.
    3. Reachability is defined by a path consisting only of adjacent Orange (7) pixels. Adjacency includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors (8-connectivity).
    4. Azure (8) pixels and grid boundaries block the pathfinding/reachability.
  Outcome: All reachable Orange (7) pixels identified in step 2 are changed to Green (3).

Final_State:
  Grid:
    Size: Same as input.
    Pixels:
      - Color: Green (3)
        Locations: Original Green locations + locations of formerly Orange pixels that were reachable.
      - Color: Orange (7)
        Locations: Original Orange locations that were *not* reachable from initial Green pixels.
      - Color: Azure (8)
        Locations: Same as input.
      - Other Colors: Same as input (if any).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify the set of all grid coordinates `(row, col)` containing the initial green (3) pixels in the input grid. Let this be the initial `ActiveSet`.
3.  Initialize an empty set `VisitedSet` to keep track of coordinates already processed.
4.  While the `ActiveSet` is not empty:
    a.  Select a coordinate `(r, c)` from the `ActiveSet` and remove it.
    b.  If `(r, c)` is already in the `VisitedSet`, continue to the next iteration.
    c.  Add `(r, c)` to the `VisitedSet`.
    d.  Check the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *input* grid.
    e.  If the color is orange (7) or initial green (3):
        i.  Change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to green (3).
        ii. For each of the 8 neighbors (horizontally, vertically, diagonally adjacent) `(nr, nc)` of `(r, c)`:
            1.  Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the grid boundaries.
            2.  If it is within boundaries and the color of the pixel at `(nr, nc)` in the *input* grid is orange (7):
                Add `(nr, nc)` to the `ActiveSet`.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
