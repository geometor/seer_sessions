            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying regions bounded by azure pixels, checking for the presence of green pixels within those regions, and transforming orange pixels to green in regions containing green. However, the code produces incorrect outputs for the given examples, transforming *all* orange pixels instead of just those in the specific regions containing initial green pixels.\n\nThe discrepancy arises because the code uses 8-way connectivity (including diagonals) to define regions. This incorrectly merges regions that should be separate according to the task's logic, as demonstrated by the expected outputs. The Azure (8) pixels appear to act as strict walls, meaning regions are only connected if non-azure pixels are adjacent horizontally or vertically (4-way connectivity).\n\nThe strategy is to refine the understanding of how regions are defined and update the natural language program and subsequently the code to use 4-way connectivity for the region-finding algorithm (like BFS or flood fill).\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** 7x7 grid with azure (8) boundaries, orange (7) pixels, and green (3) pixels.\n*   **Expected Output:** Orange pixels transform to green *only* within the 4-connected region containing the initial green pixels. Orange pixels in other 4-connected regions remain unchanged.\n*   **Actual Output:** All orange pixels transformed to green.\n*   **Analysis:** The BFS with 8-connectivity treated almost all non-azure pixels as one large region because diagonal connections across azure corners were allowed. Since this large region contained the green pixels, all orange pixels within it were transformed. The expected output clearly shows distinct regions separated by the azure lines, implying 4-connectivity.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** 5x5 grid, similar structure to Example 1.\n*   **Expected Output:** Orange pixels transform to green *only* within the 4-connected region containing the initial green pixels.\n*   **Actual Output:** All orange pixels transformed to green.\n*   **Analysis:** Same issue as Example 1. The use of 8-connectivity merged distinct regions, leading to an overly broad application of the color transformation rule.\n\n**Key Insight:** The definition of a \"region\" is crucial. The transformation is localized based on regions defined by 4-way adjacent non-azure pixels, bounded by azure pixels or grid edges.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
