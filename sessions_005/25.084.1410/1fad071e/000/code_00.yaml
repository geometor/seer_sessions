task_type: transformation
grid_properties:
  input_size: 9x9
  output_size: 1x5
color_palette:
  input: [white, blue, red] # 0, 1, 2
  output: [white, blue] # 0, 1
objects:
  - type: contiguous pixel blocks
  - specific_shape: 2x2 square
    colors: [blue, red]
pertinent_objects:
  - description: 2x2 squares composed entirely of blue (1) pixels.
    shape: [[1, 1], [1, 1]]
relationship:
  - input_feature: count of blue 2x2 squares (let's call it N)
  - output_feature: number of initial blue (1) pixels in the output row
transformation_rule:
  - action: count the number (N) of blue 2x2 squares in the input grid.
  - action: generate a 1x5 output grid.
  - action: fill the first N cells of the output grid with blue (1).
  - action: fill the remaining (5 - N) cells with white (0).
assumptions:
  - The output grid size is fixed at 1x5.
  - If the count N exceeds 5, the output grid will likely consist of five blue pixels (1 1 1 1 1), although this case is not present in the examples.
