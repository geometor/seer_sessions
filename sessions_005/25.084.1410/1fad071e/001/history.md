Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Sizes**: The input grids are consistently 9x9. The output grids are consistently 1x5 (a single row of 5 pixels).
2.  **Colors**: The input grids contain white (0), blue (1), and red (2) pixels. The output grids contain only white (0) and blue (1) pixels.
3.  **Transformation Focus**: The transformation seems to involve counting specific features in the input grid and representing that count in the output grid.
4.  **Objects**: The input grids contain distinct contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color. Some of these blocks form recognizable shapes, notably 2x2 squares of both blue and red pixels.
5.  **Pattern**: Across the examples, the number of blue pixels (1) at the beginning of the output row seems to correspond to the number of blue 2x2 square objects found in the input grid.
    *   Example 1: Input has four blue 2x2 squares. Output is `1 1 1 1 0`.
    *   Example 2: Input has two blue 2x2 squares. Output is `1 1 0 0 0`.
    *   Example 3: Input has four blue 2x2 squares. Output is `1 1 1 1 0`.
6.  **Output Structure**: The output is a fixed-size 1x5 grid. The count of blue 2x2 squares determines how many initial cells are blue (1). The remaining cells up to the total length of 5 are filled with white (0).

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: transformation
grid_properties:
  input_size: 9x9
  output_size: 1x5
color_palette:
  input: [white, blue, red] # 0, 1, 2
  output: [white, blue] # 0, 1
objects:
  - type: contiguous pixel blocks
  - specific_shape: 2x2 square
    colors: [blue, red]
pertinent_objects:
  - description: 2x2 squares composed entirely of blue (1) pixels.
    shape: [[1, 1], [1, 1]]
relationship:
  - input_feature: count of blue 2x2 squares (let's call it N)
  - output_feature: number of initial blue (1) pixels in the output row
transformation_rule:
  - action: count the number (N) of blue 2x2 squares in the input grid.
  - action: generate a 1x5 output grid.
  - action: fill the first N cells of the output grid with blue (1).
  - action: fill the remaining (5 - N) cells with white (0).
assumptions:
  - The output grid size is fixed at 1x5.
  - If the count N exceeds 5, the output grid will likely consist of five blue pixels (1 1 1 1 1), although this case is not present in the examples.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize a counter variable `blue_square_count` to zero.
2.  Iterate through all possible top-left corner positions (row `r`, column `c`) for a 2x2 square within the input grid. This means `r` ranges from 0 to `height - 2` and `c` ranges from 0 to `width - 2`.
3.  For each position (`r`, `c`), check if the pixels at (`r`, `c`), (`r+1`, `c`), (`r`, `c+1`), and (`r+1`, `c+1`) are all blue (color 1).
4.  If all four pixels form a blue 2x2 square, increment `blue_square_count`.
5.  Create a new grid with 1 row and 5 columns, initially filled with white (color 0).
6.  Fill the first `blue_square_count` columns of the output grid with blue (color 1). Ensure not to exceed the grid width of 5; if `blue_square_count` is greater than 5, only fill the first 5 columns.
7.  Return the resulting 1x5 grid.
