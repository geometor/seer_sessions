Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid contains a background (white, color 0) and exactly two distinct objects. Each object is composed of contiguous pixels of a single, non-white color. The objects are spatially separated.
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** Each output grid is consistently a 3x3 grid.
3.  **Color Preservation:** The output grid uses the same two colors present in the input grid's objects. No new colors are introduced, and the background color (white) is not present in the output.
4.  **Object Interaction:** The two input objects seem to combine or merge their patterns to form the final 3x3 output. One object's pattern appears dominant (the "primary" pattern), while the other object's color fills the remaining cells.
5.  **Determining Dominance:** The primary object (whose relative shape is preserved in the output) seems to be determined by comparing the areas of the minimal bounding boxes of the two input objects.
    *   The object with the larger bounding box area becomes the primary object.
    *   If the bounding box areas are equal, the object with the *lower* color index (e.g., blue=1 is lower than green=3) becomes the primary object.
6.  **Transformation Process:**
    *   Identify the two non-white objects and their colors.
    *   Calculate the minimal bounding box for each object.
    *   Determine the primary and secondary objects based on the bounding box area comparison (with color index tie-breaking).
    *   Find the relative coordinates of the primary object's pixels within its own bounding box.
    *   Create a 3x3 grid initialized entirely with the secondary object's color.
    *   Overwrite the cells in the 3x3 grid corresponding to the primary object's relative coordinates using the primary object's color.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: Combine two distinct colored objects from the input into a 3x3 grid, preserving the relative shape of one object (primary) and filling the rest with the color of the other object (secondary).

        Else, primary is B.
  - action: get_relative_coordinates
    inputs: [primary_object, bbox_primary]
    outputs: [relative_coords]
    description: Calculate the coordinates of the primary object's pixels relative to the top-left corner of its bounding box. Example: pixel (r, c) in bbox starting at (r0, c0) has relative coords (r-r0, c-c0).
  - action: construct_output_grid
    inputs: [primary_object, secondary_object, relative_coords]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    logic: |
      Initialize a 3x3 grid with the color of the secondary_object.
      For each (rel_r, rel_c) in relative_coords:
        Set output_grid[rel_r][rel_c] = color(primary_object).

constraints:
  - Bounding boxes of primary objects in examples are never larger than 3x3.
  - Input grid always contains exactly two non-white objects.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the two distinct non-white colored objects (Object A and Object B) in the input grid. Record their colors and the coordinates of their pixels.
2.  For each object, determine its minimal bounding box (the smallest rectangle enclosing all its pixels).
3.  Calculate the area (height * width) of each object's bounding box (Area A and Area B).
4.  Compare the bounding box areas:
    *   If Area A is greater than Area B, designate Object A as the "Primary" object and Object B as the "Secondary" object.
    *   If Area B is greater than Area A, designate Object B as the "Primary" object and Object A as the "Secondary" object.
    *   If Area A is equal to Area B, compare their color indices. Designate the object with the *smaller* color index as "Primary" and the other as "Secondary".
5.  Determine the coordinates of the Primary object's pixels *relative* to the top-left corner of its own bounding box. For example, if the bounding box starts at row `r0`, column `c0`, a pixel at `(r, c)` has relative coordinates `(r - r0, c - c0)`.
6.  Create a new 3x3 output grid. Initialize all cells of this grid with the color of the Secondary object.
7.  For each set of relative coordinates `(rel_r, rel_c)` calculated in step 5, set the cell at `output_grid[rel_r][rel_c]` to the color of the Primary object.
8.  The resulting 3x3 grid is the final output.
