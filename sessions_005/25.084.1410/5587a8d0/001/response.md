"""
Identify the background color (most frequent color) in the input grid.
Find all contiguous objects of non-background colors (treating black/0 as an object color).
For each unique object color, determine the size (pixel count) of the largest object of that color.
Count the number of unique object colors (N).
Sort these unique colors in descending order based on the size of their largest corresponding object (C1, C2, ..., CN).
Calculate the output grid dimension: dim = 2 * N - 1.
Create a square output grid of size dim x dim.
Fill the grid with concentric square frames:
- The outermost frame (border of dim x dim) uses color C1.
- The next frame inwards (border of (dim-2) x (dim-2)) uses color C2.
- Continue inwards, with the k-th frame using color Ck.
- The center pixel (frame N) uses color CN.
