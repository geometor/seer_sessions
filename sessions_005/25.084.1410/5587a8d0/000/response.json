The output grid size seems dependent on the content of the input grid, specifically the number of unique object colors.\n2.  **Background Color:** In all examples, the color white (7) appears to be the background color, filling most of the grid and not directly contributing to the output structure's colors. It seems safe to assume the most frequent color in the input is the background.\n3.  **Objects:** The input grids contain distinct contiguous shapes (objects) made of non-background colors. These colors include yellow (4), magenta (6), gray (5), azure (8), blue (1), green (3), maroon (9), and black (0). Note that black (0) acts as an object color, not a background.\n4.  **Object Properties:** The key property of these objects seems to be their color and size (number of pixels).\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves:\n    *   Identifying the non-background objects and their colors/sizes.\n    *   Sorting these objects based on size.\n    *   Constructing a new square grid whose size depends on the *number* of unique object colors found.\n    *   Filling this new grid with concentric square frames, where the color of each frame is determined by the sorted order of object sizes (largest object's color for the outermost frame, second largest for the next frame, and so on, down to the smallest object's color for the center).\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
