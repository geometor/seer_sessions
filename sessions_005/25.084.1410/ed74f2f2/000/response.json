            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are consistently 5x9. They feature a white (0) background with patterns made of gray (5) pixels. These gray pixels are concentrated within two specific 3x3 areas, separated by a column of white pixels.\n    *   Area 1: Located at rows 1-3, columns 1-3 (using 0-based indexing).\n    *   Area 2: Located at rows 1-3, columns 5-7.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are always 3x3. They consist of a white (0) background and pixels of a single color (blue=1, red=2, or green=3).\n3.  **Transformation Logic:**\n    *   The structure of the output grid strongly resembles Area 2 from the input grid. The positions of non-white pixels in the output perfectly match the positions of gray pixels in Area 2.\n    *   The *color* used in the output grid seems to be determined by the pattern of gray pixels found in Area 1 of the input grid.\n    *   By comparing the patterns in Area 1 across examples:\n        *   The pattern `[[5, 5, 5], [0, 5, 0], [0, 5, 0]]` (seen in train_1, train_3) corresponds to output color blue (1).\n        *   The pattern `[[0, 5, 5], [0, 5, 0], [5, 5, 0]]` (seen in train_2) corresponds to output color green (3).\n        *   The pattern `[[5, 5, 0], [0, 5, 0], [0, 5, 5]]` (seen in train_4, train_5, train_6) corresponds to output color red (2).\n4.  **Process Summary:** The task involves identifying two key 3x3 regions in the input. The first region acts as a key to determine an output color. The second region provides the template shape for the output. The output is generated by taking the shape from the second region and filling the non-background pixels with the color determined by the first region.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
