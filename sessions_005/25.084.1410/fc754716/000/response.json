            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid consists primarily of `white` (0) pixels, with a single non-`white` pixel located somewhere within the grid, but not on the absolute edge.\n2.  **Output Structure:** Each output grid has the same dimensions as its corresponding input. The output features a one-pixel thick border around its perimeter. The color of this border matches the color of the single non-`white` pixel found in the input. The interior of the output grid (everything inside the border) is filled with `white` (0) pixels.\n3.  **Color Transformation:** The key transformation involves identifying the color of the single non-`white` pixel in the input and using that color to draw the border in the output.\n4.  **Shape Transformation:** The input's single pixel structure is replaced by a hollow rectangle (the border) in the output. The size of this rectangle is determined by the dimensions of the input grid.\n5.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds across all provided training examples. The input color dictates the output border color, and the output is always a border of that color around a `white` interior, matching the input grid dimensions.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
