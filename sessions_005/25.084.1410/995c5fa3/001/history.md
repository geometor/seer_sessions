*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input grids consistently have dimensions 4x14.
    *   The input grids are visually divided into three main sections (4x4 squares) by vertical columns of 'white' pixels (color 0) at column indices 4 and 9.
    *   The background or predominant color in the input grids is 'gray' (color 5).
    *   Each 4x4 section contains a pattern using a single distinct color other than 'white' or 'gray'. These colors are 'azure' (8), 'red' (2), 'green' (3), or 'yellow' (4).
    *   The output grids are always 3x3.
    *   Each row in the output grid consists of a single repeated color.
    *   There is a correspondence between the three 4x4 sections in the input and the three rows in the output. The first section maps to the first row, the second to the second, and the third to the third.
    *   The color used to fill each output row is the distinct color (non-'white', non-'gray') found within the corresponding 4x4 section of the input grid.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Identify the unique non-background color in three distinct sections of the input grid and use these colors to create a 3x3 output grid where each row corresponds to a section.
    input_grid:
      properties:
        - dimensions: 4x14
        - background_color: 'gray' (5)
        - separator_color: 'white' (0)
        - structure: Contains three 4x4 sections separated by single columns of 'white' pixels at indices 4 and 9.
      sections:
        - section_1: Columns 0-3
        - section_2: Columns 5-8
        - section_3: Columns 10-13
      objects:
        - type: section_pattern
          location: Within each 4x4 section.
          properties:
            - Consists of pixels of a single color different from 'gray' (5) and 'white' (0).
            - This color is the 'significant_color' for that section.
    output_grid:
      properties:
        - dimensions: 3x3
        - structure: Each row contains a single repeated color.
    transformation:
      mapping: Input section to output row (section_1 -> row_0, section_2 -> row_1, section_3 -> row_2).
      rule: For each input section, find the unique color that is neither 'gray' (5) nor 'white' (0). Create the output grid by filling the corresponding row entirely with this found color.
      output_colors: Derived from the 'significant_color' of each input section.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the three 4x4 sections within the 4x14 input grid. The first section spans columns 0 to 3, the second section spans columns 5 to 8, and the third section spans columns 10 to 13. Columns 4 and 9, filled with 'white' (0), act as separators.
    2.  For the first section (columns 0-3), find the unique color present that is not 'gray' (5) and not 'white' (0). Let this be `color_1`.
    3.  For the second section (columns 5-8), find the unique color present that is not 'gray' (5) and not 'white' (0). Let this be `color_2`.
    4.  For the third section (columns 10-13), find the unique color present that is not 'gray' (5) and not 'white' (0). Let this be `color_3`.
    5.  Construct a 3x3 output grid.
    6.  Fill the first row (row index 0) of the output grid entirely with `color_1`.
    7.  Fill the second row (row index 1) of the output grid entirely with `color_2`.
    8.  Fill the third row (row index 2) of the output grid entirely with `color_3`.
