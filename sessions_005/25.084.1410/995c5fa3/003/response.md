"""
The transformation rule involves analyzing a 4x14 input grid composed of three 
4x4 sections separated by single columns of white (0) pixels. Each 4x4 section 
contains a pattern primarily made of gray (5) pixels and potentially some white (0) 
pixels. The specific pattern of white pixels within each section determines a 
corresponding output color. The output is a 3x3 grid where the first row is 
filled with the color derived from the first section's pattern, the second row 
with the color from the second section's pattern, and the third row with the 
color from the third section's pattern.

The mapping rules from white pixel patterns to output colors are:
1. If the section contains no white pixels (only gray 5s), the output color is Red (2).
2. If the section contains a 2x2 block of white pixels centered horizontally and 
   vertically (at relative indices [1,1], [1,2], [2,1], [2,2]), the output color 
   is Azure (8).
3. If the section contains a 2x2 block of white pixels centered horizontally but 
   at the bottom (at relative indices [2,1], [2,2], [3,1], [3,2]), the output 
   color is Yellow (4).
4. If the section contains two vertical bars of white pixels (2 pixels high) at 
   the left and right edges (at relative indices [1,0], [2,0] and [1,3], [2,3]), 
   the output color is Green (3).
