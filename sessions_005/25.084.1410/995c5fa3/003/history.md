## General Assessment

The previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed the "significant" feature within each 4x4 section was a unique non-background color. The analysis shows the code returned -1 for all sections across all examples, indicating it never found a color other than gray (5) or white (0).

The core issue is a misinterpretation of the task's pattern recognition requirement. The significant feature isn't a color *within* the section, but rather the *shape or pattern* formed by the **white (0)** pixels inside the gray (5) frame of each 4x4 section. The transformation maps these specific white pixel patterns to distinct output colors.

## Strategy for Resolution

1.  **Isolate Sections:** Continue isolating the three 4x4 sections from the input grid (columns 0-3, 5-8, 10-13).
2.  **Identify White Pixel Pattern:** For each section, specifically analyze the arrangement of white (0) pixels. The gray (5) pixels act as a frame or background for these patterns.
3.  **Map Pattern to Color:** Establish a mapping rule that connects each observed white pixel pattern to a specific output color. Based on the examples, the following patterns and corresponding colors have been identified:
    *   **Pattern 1:** No white pixels (section is all gray). -> Output Color: **Red (2)**.
    *   **Pattern 2:** A 2x2 block of white pixels centered horizontally and vertically within the 4x4 section (at relative indices [1,1], [1,2], [2,1], [2,2]). -> Output Color: **Azure (8)**.
    *   **Pattern 3:** A 2x2 block of white pixels centered horizontally but at the bottom of the 4x4 section (at relative indices [2,1], [2,2], [3,1], [3,2]). -> Output Color: **Yellow (4)**.
    *   **Pattern 4:** Two vertical bars of two white pixels each, located at the left and right edges of the 4x4 section (at relative indices [1,0], [2,0] and [1,3], [2,3]). -> Output Color: **Green (3)**.
4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid. Fill the first row with the color mapped from the first section's pattern, the second row with the color from the second section's pattern, and the third row with the color from the third section's pattern.

The analysis confirms a consistent mapping between the white pixel patterns within the 4x4 sections and the output colors across all training examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Divide the 4x14 input grid into three 4x4 sections: Section 1 (columns 0-3), Section 2 (columns 5-8), and Section 3 (columns 10-13). Ignore the white delimiter columns (4 and 9).
2.  For each section, identify the pattern formed by the white (0) pixels within the gray (5) frame.
3.  Determine the output color for each section based on the following mapping rule:
    *   If the section contains no white pixels (only gray), the color is **Red (2)**.
    *   If the section contains a 2x2 block of white pixels centered horizontally and vertically (at relative row indices 1, 2 and column indices 1, 2), the color is **Azure (8)**.
    *   If the section contains a 2x2 block of white pixels centered horizontally but at the bottom (at relative row indices 2, 3 and column indices 1, 2), the color is **Yellow (4)**.
    *   If the section contains two vertical bars of white pixels (2 pixels high) at the left and right edges (at relative row indices 1, 2 and column indices 0, 3), the color is **Green (3)**.
4.  Create a new 3x3 output grid.
5.  Fill the entire first row of the output grid with the color determined from Section 1.
6.  Fill the entire second row of the output grid with the color determined from Section 2.
7.  Fill the entire third row of the output grid with the color determined from Section 3.
