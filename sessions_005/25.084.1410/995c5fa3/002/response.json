            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed the \"significant\" feature within each 4x4 section was a unique non-background color. The analysis shows the code returned -1 for all sections across all examples, indicating it never found a color other than gray (5) or white (0).\n\nThe core issue is a misinterpretation of the task's pattern recognition requirement. The significant feature isn't a color *within* the section, but rather the *shape or pattern* formed by the **white (0)** pixels inside the gray (5) frame of each 4x4 section. The transformation maps these specific white pixel patterns to distinct output colors.\n\n## Strategy for Resolution\n\n1.  **Isolate Sections:** Continue isolating the three 4x4 sections from the input grid (columns 0-3, 5-8, 10-13).\n2.  **Identify White Pixel Pattern:** For each section, specifically analyze the arrangement of white (0) pixels. The gray (5) pixels act as a frame or background for these patterns.\n3.  **Map Pattern to Color:** Establish a mapping rule that connects each observed white pixel pattern to a specific output color. Based on the examples, the following patterns and corresponding colors have been identified:\n    *   **Pattern 1:** No white pixels (section is all gray). -> Output Color: **Red (2)**.\n    *   **Pattern 2:** A 2x2 block of white pixels centered horizontally and vertically within the 4x4 section (at relative indices [1,1], [1,2], [2,1], [2,2]). -> Output Color: **Azure (8)**.\n    *   **Pattern 3:** A 2x2 block of white pixels centered horizontally but at the bottom of the 4x4 section (at relative indices [2,1], [2,2], [3,1], [3,2]). -> Output Color: **Yellow (4)**.\n    *   **Pattern 4:** Two vertical bars of two white pixels each, located at the left and right edges of the 4x4 section (at relative indices [1,0], [2,0] and [1,3], [2,3]). -> Output Color: **Green (3)**.\n4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid. Fill the first row with the color mapped from the first section's pattern, the second row with the color from the second section's pattern, and the third row with the color from the third section's pattern.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example | Section | Columns | White Pixel Pattern (relative indices)                               | Identified Pattern Type | Expected Output Color |\n| :------ | :------ | :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------- | :-------------------- |\n| 1       | 1       | 0-3     | `(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)`                                         | Center 2x2 block      | 8 (Azure)             |\n| 1       | 2       | 5-8     | None                                                                 | No white pixels       | 2 (Red)               |\n| 1       | 3       | 10-13   | `(2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`                                         | Bottom-center 2x2 block | 4 (Yellow)            |\n| 2       | 1       | 0-3     | `(1,0), (2,0), (1,3), (2,3)`                                         | Vertical edge bars    | 3 (Green)             |\n| 2       | 2       | 5-8     | `(2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`                                         | Bottom-center 2x2 block | 4 (Yellow)            |\n| 2       | 3       | 10-13   | None                                                                 | No white pixels       | 2 (Red)               |\n| 3       | 1       | 0-3     | None                                                                 | No white pixels       | 2 (Red)               |\n| 3       | 2       | 5-8     | `(2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`                                         | Bottom-center 2x2 block | 4 (Yellow)            |\n| 3       | 3       | 10-13   | None                                                                 | No white pixels       | 2 (Red)               |\n| 4       | 1       | 0-3     | None                                                                 | No white pixels       | 2 (Red)               |\n| 4       | 2       | 5-8     | `(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)`                                         | Center 2x2 block      | 8 (Azure)             |\n| 4       | 3       | 10-13   | `(1,0), (2,0), (1,3), (2,3)`                                         | Vertical edge bars    | 3 (Green)             |\n\nThe analysis confirms a consistent mapping between the white pixel patterns within the 4x4 sections and the output colors across all training examples.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
