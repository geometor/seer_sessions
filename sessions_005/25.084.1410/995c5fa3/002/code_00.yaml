            location: columns 0-3
            size: 4x4
            properties: Contains a gray (5) frame and an internal pattern of white (0) pixels.

            type: column
            location: column 4
            size: 4x1

            location: columns 5-8
            size: 4x4
            properties: Contains a gray (5) frame and an internal pattern of white (0) pixels.
        - delimiter_2:
            type: column
            location: column 9
            size: 4x1
            properties: Filled with white (0).
        - section_3:
            type: subgrid
            location: columns 10-13
            size: 4x4
            properties: Contains a gray (5) frame and an internal pattern of white (0) pixels.
objects:
  - object: pattern
    description: Arrangement of white (0) pixels within a 4x4 gray (5) framed section.
    properties:
      - location: relative indices within the 4x4 section
      - shape: configuration of white pixels (e.g., block, bars, none)
    observed_patterns:
      - name: no_white
        description: Section contains only gray (5) pixels.
      - name: center_block
        description: 2x2 white block at relative indices (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).
      - name: bottom_block
        description: 2x2 white block at relative indices (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2).
      - name: edge_bars
        description: Two 2x1 vertical white bars at relative indices (1,0), (2,0) and (1,3), (2,3).
actions:
  - action: identify_sections
    description: Extract the three 4x4 subgrids from the input grid based on column indices.
    inputs: input_grid (4x14)
    outputs: section_1 (4x4), section_2 (4x4), section_3 (4x4)
  - action: map_pattern_to_color
    description: Determine the output color based on the identified white pixel pattern within each section.
    inputs: section (4x4)
    outputs: color (integer 0-9)
    mapping_rules:
      - if pattern is no_white then color is 2 (red)
      - if pattern is center_block then color is 8 (azure)
      - if pattern is bottom_block then color is 4 (yellow)
      - if pattern is edge_bars then color is 3 (green)
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create a 3x3 grid and fill each row with the color corresponding to the pattern found in the respective section (row 1 from section 1, row 2 from section 2, row 3 from section 3).
    inputs: color_1, color_2, color_3
    outputs: output_grid (3x3)
