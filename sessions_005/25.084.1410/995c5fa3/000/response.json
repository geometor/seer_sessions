These colors are 'azure' (8), 'red' (2), 'green' (3), or 'yellow' (4).\n    *   The output grids are always 3x3.\n    *   Each row in the output grid consists of a single repeated color.\n    *   There is a correspondence between the three 4x4 sections in the input and the three rows in the output. The first section maps to the first row, the second to the second, and the third to the third.\n    *   The color used to fill each output row is the distinct color (non-'white', non-'gray') found within the corresponding 4x4 section of the input grid.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
