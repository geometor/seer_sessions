The output grid retains all the 'azure' pixels from the input but changes some 'white' pixels to 'blue' (1).\n\nObserving the locations where 'white' changes to 'blue', they appear consistently in relation to specific patterns of 'azure' pixels. Specifically, the change occurs at a 'white' pixel that forms the missing corner of a 2x2 square where the other three pixels are 'azure'. This configuration corresponds to the 'inner corner' of a 3-pixel L-shape formed by the 'azure' pixels.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
