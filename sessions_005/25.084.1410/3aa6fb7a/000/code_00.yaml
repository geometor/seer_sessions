task_elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - foreground_color: azure (8)
      - transformation_color: blue (1)
  - element: object
    type: L-shape
    definition: Three azure (8) pixels within a 2x2 area, where one pixel is adjacent to the other two, and those two are not adjacent to each other.
    examples:
      - coordinates: [(r, c), (r+1, c), (r, c+1)]
      - coordinates: [(r, c), (r+1, c), (r+1, c+1)]
      - coordinates: [(r, c), (r, c+1), (r+1, c+1)]
      - coordinates: [(r+1, c), (r, c+1), (r+1, c+1)]
  - element: target_pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - location: The single white pixel within a 2x2 area that otherwise contains three azure (8) pixels (forming an L-shape). It occupies the 'inner corner' of the L-shape.
  - element: transformation
    action: Change color
    input_pixel: white (0) target_pixel
    output_pixel: blue (1)
    condition: The pixel must be the white pixel completing a 2x2 square with three azure pixels.
    scope: Applies to all such target pixels identified in the input grid.
    preservation: All other pixels (azure pixels and white pixels not meeting the condition) retain their original color and position.
