**Perception:**

The task presents pairs of input and output grids. In all provided examples (train_1, train_2, train_3), the input grid is consistently 7x7 pixels, and the output grid is consistently 6x6 pixels. Visually comparing the input and output grids reveals that the output grid appears to be a subgrid of the input grid. Specifically, the output grid corresponds exactly to the input grid but with the topmost row and the leftmost column removed. The colors and internal patterns within the remaining grid are preserved.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_name: crop_top_left
observations:
  - example: train_1
    input_grid_size: [7, 7]
    output_grid_size: [6, 6]
    transformation: removal of row 0 and column 0
    preserved_content: subgrid from input[1:, 1:] matches output[0:, 0:]
  - example: train_2
    input_grid_size: [7, 7]
    output_grid_size: [6, 6]
    transformation: removal of row 0 and column 0
    preserved_content: subgrid from input[1:, 1:] matches output[0:, 0:]
  - example: train_3
    input_grid_size: [7, 7]
    output_grid_size: [6, 6]
    transformation: removal of row 0 and column 0
    preserved_content: subgrid from input[1:, 1:] matches output[0:, 0:]
derived_properties:
  - grid_size_change: input height decreases by 1, input width decreases by 1
  - transformation_type: cropping, subgrid extraction
  - removed_elements:
      - row index 0
      - column index 0
  - invariant_elements: all pixels not in row 0 or column 0 maintain their color and relative position.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input grid.
2.  Remove the first row (row index 0) from the input grid.
3.  Remove the first column (column index 0) from the resulting grid.
4.  The remaining grid is the output grid.
