In all provided examples (train_1, train_2, train_3), the input grid is consistently 7x7 pixels, and the output grid is consistently 6x6 pixels. Visually comparing the input and output grids reveals that the output grid appears to be a subgrid of the input grid. Specifically, the output grid corresponds exactly to the input grid but with the topmost row and the leftmost column removed. The colors and internal patterns within the remaining grid are preserved.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
