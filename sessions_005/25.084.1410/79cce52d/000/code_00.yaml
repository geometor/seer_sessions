task_name: crop_top_left
observations:
  - example: train_1
    input_grid_size: [7, 7]
    output_grid_size: [6, 6]
    transformation: removal of row 0 and column 0
    preserved_content: subgrid from input[1:, 1:] matches output[0:, 0:]
  - example: train_2
    input_grid_size: [7, 7]
    output_grid_size: [6, 6]
    transformation: removal of row 0 and column 0
    preserved_content: subgrid from input[1:, 1:] matches output[0:, 0:]
  - example: train_3
    input_grid_size: [7, 7]
    output_grid_size: [6, 6]
    transformation: removal of row 0 and column 0
    preserved_content: subgrid from input[1:, 1:] matches output[0:, 0:]
derived_properties:
  - grid_size_change: input height decreases by 1, input width decreases by 1
  - transformation_type: cropping, subgrid extraction
  - removed_elements:
      - row index 0
      - column index 0
  - invariant_elements: all pixels not in row 0 or column 0 maintain their color and relative position.
