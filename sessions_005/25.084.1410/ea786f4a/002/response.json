            "text": "The code execution confirms the hypothesis. The white pixels in the output are exactly those pixels (r, c) such that `abs(r - r0) == abs(c - c0)`, where (r0, c0) is the location of the single white pixel in the input. The non-white pixels retain their original color.\n\nNow I can formulate the report.## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code implemented a hypothesis based on the parity of the Manhattan distance from the single white pixel found in the input grid. While this worked for Example 2, it failed for Examples 1 and 3, producing patterns with more white pixels than expected.\n\nAnalysis of the failed examples revealed that the correct pattern of white pixels in the output corresponds to pixels lying on the diagonal lines passing through the original white pixel. Specifically, a pixel at `(r, c)` becomes white if and only if `abs(r - r0) == abs(c - c0)`, where `(r0, c0)` are the coordinates of the unique white pixel in the input grid. Pixels not meeting this condition retain their original color.\n\nThe strategy is to update the transformation logic to implement this diagonal condition instead of the Manhattan distance parity check.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the analysis and code execution results:\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Input: 5x5 grid. One white pixel (0) at (2, 2). 24 red pixels (2).\n- Output: 5x5 grid. White pixels at (0,0), (0,4), (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3), (4,0), (4,4). These 9 pixels satisfy `abs(r - 2) == abs(c - 2)`. The remaining 16 pixels are red (2).\n\n**Example 2:**\n- Input: 3x3 grid. One white pixel (0) at (1, 1). 8 blue pixels (1).\n- Output: 3x3 grid. White pixels at (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). These 5 pixels satisfy `abs(r - 1) == abs(c - 1)`. The remaining 4 pixels are blue (1).\n\n**Example 3:**\n- Input: 7x7 grid. One white pixel (0) at (3, 3). 48 green pixels (3).\n- Output: 7x7 grid. White pixels at (0,0), (0,6), (1,1), (1,5), (2,2), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (4,4), (5,1), (5,5), (6,0), (6,6). These 13 pixels satisfy `abs(r - 3) == abs(c - 3)`. The remaining 36 pixels are green (3).\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All examples have exactly one white pixel (0) in the input.\n- The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n- The output grid contains only white pixels (0) and the non-white color from the input grid.\n- The transformation involves changing some non-white pixels to white based on their geometric relationship to the original white pixel.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
