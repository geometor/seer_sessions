task_description: Identify the unique white pixel. Draw diagonal lines (slope +1 and -1) through this pixel. Change all pixels on these diagonal lines to white. Other pixels retain their original color.

observations:
  - object_type: grid
    property: 
      - dimensions: constant between input and output (e.g., 5x5, 3x3, 7x7)
      - colors: 
        - input contains exactly one white pixel (0) and multiple pixels of one other color (e.g., red(2), blue(1), green(3)).
        - output contains white pixels (0) and pixels of the non-white color from the input.
  - object_type: pixel
    property: 
      - location: (row, column) coordinates
      - color: integer 0-9
    relationship:
      - relative_position: distance and direction relative to the initial white pixel.
      - diagonal: A pixel (r, c) is on a diagonal relative to the white pixel (r0, c0) if abs(r - r0) == abs(c - c0).

actions:
  - name: find_object
    params: 
      color: white (0)
    output: coordinates (r0, c0) of the unique white pixel.
  - name: iterate_pixels
    params: input_grid
    output: each pixel (r, c) with its color.
  - name: calculate_relative_position
    params: pixel_coords (r, c), reference_coords (r0, c0)
    output: delta_row (r - r0), delta_col (c - c0)
  - name: check_condition
    params: delta_row, delta_col
    condition: abs(delta_row) == abs(delta_col)
  - name: modify_pixel
    params: pixel_coords (r, c), output_grid
    action: If the condition (abs(delta_row) == abs(delta_col)) is true, set the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the output grid to white (0). Otherwise, keep the original color from the input grid.
  - name: copy_grid
    params: input_grid
    action: Create an output grid initially identical to the input grid. This handles pixels that don't change. (Alternative: create a new grid and fill based on condition).
