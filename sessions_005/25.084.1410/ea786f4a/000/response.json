            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\nEach example consists of an input grid and an output grid of the same dimensions. The input grids predominantly feature one color (red, blue, or green) with a single white pixel located somewhere within the grid. The output grids also contain the original white pixel, but additional pixels have been changed to white. The pattern of these new white pixels seems related to their position relative to the original white pixel. Specifically, the pixels that become white in the output appear to form a pattern based on their distance from the initial white pixel. Calculating the Manhattan distance (`|row1 - row2| + |col1 - col2|`) between each pixel and the original white pixel reveals that pixels with an *even* Manhattan distance become white in the output, while pixels with an *odd* Manhattan distance retain their original color (which is the background color, since the only other input color is white at distance 0).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
