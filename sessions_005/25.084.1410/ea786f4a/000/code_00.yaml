Task: Color pixels based on Manhattan distance parity from a specific point.

Input:
  - type: grid
  - properties:
      - contains pixels of a single background color (e.g., red, blue, green)
      - contains exactly one white (0) pixel, acting as a reference point.

Output:
  - type: grid
  - properties:
      - same dimensions as the input grid.
      - pixels at coordinates (r, c) are white (0) if the Manhattan distance `|r - r0| + |c - c0|` from the reference white pixel at (r0, c0) is even.
      - pixels at coordinates (r, c) retain their original color from the input grid if the Manhattan distance `|r - r0| + |c - c0|` from the reference white pixel at (r0, c0) is odd.

Relationships:
  - The position of the single white pixel in the input determines the pattern in the output.
  - The color of each output pixel depends on its Manhattan distance parity relative to the input white pixel.
