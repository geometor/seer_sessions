```python
"""
Color pixels based on the parity of their Manhattan distance from a single white pixel.

1. Find the coordinates (row `r0`, column `c0`) of the unique white pixel (value 0) in the input grid.
2. Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially as a copy of the input.
3. For each pixel at position (row `r`, column `c`) in the input grid:
    a. Calculate the Manhattan distance `d` to the white pixel: `d = abs(r - r0) + abs(c - c0)`.
    b. If `d` is even, set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the new grid to white (0).
    c. If `d` is odd, the pixel retains its original color (already handled by copying).
4. The new grid is the output.

The code execution confirms the hypothesis. The white pixels in the output are exactly those pixels (r, c) such that `abs(r - r0) == abs(c - c0)`, where (r0, c0) is the location of the single white pixel in the input. The non-white pixels retain their original color.

Now I can formulate the report.## General Assessment

The initial code implemented a hypothesis based on the parity of the Manhattan distance from the single white pixel found in the input grid. While this worked for Example 2, it failed for Examples 1 and 3, producing patterns with more white pixels than expected.

Analysis of the failed examples revealed that the correct pattern of white pixels in the output corresponds to pixels lying on the diagonal lines passing through the original white pixel. Specifically, a pixel at `(r, c)` becomes white if and only if `abs(r - r0) == abs(c - c0)`, where `(r0, c0)` are the coordinates of the unique white pixel in the input grid. Pixels not meeting this condition retain their original color.

The strategy is to update the transformation logic to implement this diagonal condition instead of the Manhattan distance parity check.

## Metrics

Based on the analysis and code execution results:

**Example 1:**
- Input: 5x5 grid. One white pixel (0) at (2, 2). 24 red pixels (2).
- Output: 5x5 grid. White pixels at (0,0), (0,4), (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3), (4,0), (4,4). These 9 pixels satisfy `abs(r - 2) == abs(c - 2)`. The remaining 16 pixels are red (2).

**Example 2:**
- Input: 3x3 grid. One white pixel (0) at (1, 1). 8 blue pixels (1).
- Output: 3x3 grid. White pixels at (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). These 5 pixels satisfy `abs(r - 1) == abs(c - 1)`. The remaining 4 pixels are blue (1).

**Example 3:**
- Input: 7x7 grid. One white pixel (0) at (3, 3). 48 green pixels (3).
- Output: 7x7 grid. White pixels at (0,0), (0,6), (1,1), (1,5), (2,2), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (4,4), (5,1), (5,5), (6,0), (6,6). These 13 pixels satisfy `abs(r - 3) == abs(c - 3)`. The remaining 36 pixels are green (3).

**General Observations:**
- All examples have exactly one white pixel (0) in the input.
- The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
- The output grid contains only white pixels (0) and the non-white color from the input grid.
- The transformation involves changing some non-white pixels to white based on their geometric relationship to the original white pixel.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Identify the unique white pixel. Draw diagonal lines (slope +1 and -1) through this pixel. Change all pixels on these diagonal lines to white. Other pixels retain their original color.

observations:
  - object_type: grid
    property: 
      - dimensions: constant between input and output (e.g., 5x5, 3x3, 7x7)
      - colors: 
        - input contains exactly one white pixel (0) and multiple pixels of one other color (e.g., red(2), blue(1), green(3)).
        - output contains white pixels (0) and pixels of the non-white color from the input.
  - object_type: pixel
    property: 
      - location: (row, column) coordinates
      - color: integer 0-9
    relationship:
      - relative_position: distance and direction relative to the initial white pixel.
      - diagonal: A pixel (r, c) is on a diagonal relative to the white pixel (r0, c0) if abs(r - r0) == abs(c - c0).

actions:
  - name: find_object
    params: 
      color: white (0)
    output: coordinates (r0, c0) of the unique white pixel.
  - name: iterate_pixels
    params: input_grid
    output: each pixel (r, c) with its color.
  - name: calculate_relative_position
    params: pixel_coords (r, c), reference_coords (r0, c0)
    output: delta_row (r - r0), delta_col (c - c0)
  - name: check_condition
    params: delta_row, delta_col
    condition: abs(delta_row) == abs(delta_col)
  - name: modify_pixel
    params: pixel_coords (r, c), output_grid
    action: If the condition (abs(delta_row) == abs(delta_col)) is true, set the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the output grid to white (0). Otherwise, keep the original color from the input grid.
  - name: copy_grid
    params: input_grid
    action: Create an output grid initially identical to the input grid. This handles pixels that don't change. (Alternative: create a new grid and fill based on condition).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find the coordinates `(r0, c0)` of the unique white pixel (color 0) in the input grid.
3.  Iterate through each pixel at coordinates `(r, c)` in the input grid.
4.  Calculate the absolute difference in rows `dr = abs(r - r0)` and the absolute difference in columns `dc = abs(c - c0)`.
5.  Check if `dr` is equal to `dc`.
6.  If `dr == dc`, set the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to white (0).
7.  If `dr != dc`, the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid retains its original color (which is already set from the initial copy).
8.  Return the modified output grid.
