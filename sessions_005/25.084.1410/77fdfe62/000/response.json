Its dimensions match the dimensions of the central area *inside* the blue frame of the input grid.\n\n3.  **Transformation Logic:**\n    *   The output grid seems to be derived directly from the central area (inside the blue frame) of the input grid.\n    *   The white (0) pixels within the input's central area appear to remain white (0) in the corresponding positions in the output grid.\n    *   The azure (8) pixels within the input's central area are replaced in the output grid. The replacement color depends on the position of the azure pixel within the central area.\n    *   Specifically, the central area can be divided into four equal quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).\n    *   If an azure (8) pixel is in the Top-Left quadrant of the central area, it's replaced by the color of the Top-Left corner pixel of the *original input grid*.\n    *   Similarly, azure (8) pixels in the Top-Right, Bottom-Left, and Bottom-Right quadrants of the central area are replaced by the colors of the Top-Right, Bottom-Left, and Bottom-Right corner pixels of the *original input grid*, respectively.\n\n4.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds across all three training examples. The size of the central area determines the output size, and the mapping rule based on azure pixels, quadrants, and input corner colors consistently produces the correct output.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
