Task: Map pixels within a framed area based on position and input corner colors.

Input_Grid:
  - Properties:
      - Contains a blue (1) frame.
      - Frame is 1 pixel thick.
      - Frame is offset by 1 pixel from the grid edges.
      - Has distinct colors at the four corner pixels (C_TL, C_TR, C_BL, C_BR).
      - Contains a central rectangular area ('Inner_Grid') enclosed by the blue frame.
  - Objects:
      - Blue_Frame: A rectangle of blue (1) pixels.
      - Inner_Grid: The rectangular subgrid enclosed by Blue_Frame.
        - Properties: Contains white (0) and azure (8) pixels. Dimensions determine Output_Grid size. Can be divided into four equal quadrants (Q_TL, Q_TR, Q_BL, Q_BR).
      - Corner_Pixels: The four pixels at the absolute corners of Input_Grid.
        - Properties: C_TL (Top-Left), C_TR (Top-Right), C_BL (Bottom-Left), C_BR (Bottom-Right). Values are used for mapping.

Output_Grid:
  - Properties:
      - Dimensions match Inner_Grid dimensions.
      - Content is derived from Inner_Grid.

Transformation:
  - Action: Identify Blue_Frame and extract Inner_Grid.
  - Action: Identify the four Corner_Pixels (C_TL, C_TR, C_BL, C_BR) of Input_Grid.
  - Action: Create Output_Grid with the same dimensions as Inner_Grid.
  - Rule: For each pixel `P` at `(r, c)` in Inner_Grid:
      - If `P` is white (0), set Output_Grid pixel at `(r, c)` to white (0).
      - If `P` is azure (8):
          - Determine the quadrant of `(r, c)` within Inner_Grid.
          - If `(r, c)` is in Q_TL, set Output_Grid pixel at `(r, c)` to C_TL.
          - If `(r, c)` is in Q_TR, set Output_Grid pixel at `(r, c)` to C_TR.
          - If `(r, c)` is in Q_BL, set Output_Grid pixel at `(r, c)` to C_BL.
          - If `(r, c)` is in Q_BR, set Output_Grid pixel at `(r, c)` to C_BR.

Relationships:
  - Output_Grid size is determined by Inner_Grid size.
  - Output_Grid content depends on Inner_Grid pixel values and their positions relative to Inner_Grid quadrants.
  - The colors used for replacement in Output_Grid are sourced from the Corner_Pixels of Input_Grid.
