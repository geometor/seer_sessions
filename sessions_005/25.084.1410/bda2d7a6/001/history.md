Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid seems to have a nested structure, like concentric frames or layers of different colors. There's typically an outermost border, a frame inside it, and then an inner region which might be a solid block or contain other shapes.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains the same dimensions and the same nested structure as the input.
3.  **Color Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the colors of these nested layers. It appears the colors are being cyclically shifted or swapped between the layers.
4.  **Layer Identification:**
    *   In `train_1`, we see Azure(8) border -> White(0) frame -> Gray(5) frame -> Inner region with Azure(8) shapes on a White(0) background.
    *   In `train_2`, we see White(0) border -> Orange(7) frame -> Inner Magenta(6) block.
    *   In `train_3`, we see Green(3) border -> Red(2) frame -> Inner White(0) block.
5.  **Color Mapping Rule:** Let's denote the color of the outermost layer as C1, the next layer in as C2, and the third layer/innermost main color as C3.
    *   `train_1`: C1=Azure(8), C2=White(0), C3=Gray(5). Output layers are Gray(5), Azure(8), White(0). This suggests the mapping: C1 -> C3, C2 -> C1, C3 -> C2.
    *   `train_2`: C1=White(0), C2=Orange(7), C3=Magenta(6). Output layers are Magenta(6), White(0), Orange(7). This follows the same mapping: C1 -> C3, C2 -> C1, C3 -> C2.
    *   `train_3`: C1=Green(3), C2=Red(2), C3=White(0). Output layers are White(0), Green(3), Red(2). Again, this follows the mapping: C1 -> C3, C2 -> C1, C3 -> C2.
6.  **Innermost Region Handling:**
    *   In `train_1`, the innermost Azure(8) pixels become Gray(5) (which is the *new* color of the outermost layer, C3). The innermost White(0) pixels remain White(0).
    *   In `train_2`, the innermost Magenta(6) pixels (C3) become Orange(7) (C2). This is consistent with the main rule C3 -> C2.
    *   In `train_3`, the innermost White(0) pixels (C3) become Red(2) (C2). This is also consistent with the main rule C3 -> C2.
    *   It seems the rule is slightly different for `train_1`. Let's re-evaluate C3 for `train_1`. The *frame* is Gray(5), but the *content* inside that frame consists of Azure(8) and White(0). If we strictly follow the pixel colors:
        *   Pixels with color C1 (Azure 8) become color C3 (Gray 5).
        *   Pixels with color C2 (White 0, the frame) become color C1 (Azure 8).
        *   Pixels with color C3 (Gray 5, the frame) become color C2 (White 0).
        *   Pixels inside the C3 frame: If original color is Azure 8, they become Gray 5 (C3). If original color is White 0, they remain White 0.
    *   This refined rule holds for all examples: pixels matching C1, C2, C3 change according to the cycle (C1->C3, C2->C1, C3->C2). Pixels *enclosed* by the shape formed by C3 pixels change color *if they are not White(0)*, taking on the color C3. Otherwise (if White 0), they remain White 0.

      2. Else if input[r, c] == C2, set output[r, c] = C1.
      3. Else if input[r, c] == C3, set output[r, c] = C2.
      4. Else if the pixel (r, c) is located geometrically inside the shape formed by Layer3 pixels:
         a. If input[r, c] == White(0), set output[r, c] = White(0).
         b. Else (if input[r,c] is not White(0)), set output[r, c] = C3.
      5. Else (for pixels not part of Layer1, Layer2, Layer3, or InnerContent - unlikely given examples), copy the input color to the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Analyze the input grid to identify the colors of the three nested layers, starting from the outermost border. Let the color of the outermost border (Layer 1) be C1. Let the color of the layer immediately inside it (Layer 2) be C2. Let the color of the layer or distinct object immediately inside that (Layer 3) be C3.
2.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with a default color (e.g., White 0).
3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
4.  For each pixel, check its original color:
    *   If the original color is C1, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to color C3.
    *   If the original color is C2, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to color C1.
    *   If the original color is C3, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to color C2.
5.  After processing pixels matching C1, C2, and C3, identify the region geometrically enclosed by the pixels that originally had color C3.
6.  For each pixel within this enclosed region:
    *   If the pixel's original color in the input grid was White (0), keep its color as White (0) in the output grid.
    *   If the pixel's original color was *not* White (0), set its color in the output grid to C3 (the color that replaced C1).
7.  Ensure any remaining pixels (if any exist, though unlikely based on examples) retain their original color (this primarily covers the case where the innermost content was White 0 and remains White 0).
8.  Return the completed output grid.
