            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid seems to have a nested structure, like concentric frames or layers of different colors. There's typically an outermost border, a frame inside it, and then an inner region which might be a solid block or contain other shapes.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains the same dimensions and the same nested structure as the input.\n3.  **Color Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the colors of these nested layers. It appears the colors are being cyclically shifted or swapped between the layers.\n4.  **Layer Identification:**\n    *   In `train_1`, we see Azure(8) border -> White(0) frame -> Gray(5) frame -> Inner region with Azure(8) shapes on a White(0) background.\n    *   In `train_2`, we see White(0) border -> Orange(7) frame -> Inner Magenta(6) block.\n    *   In `train_3`, we see Green(3) border -> Red(2) frame -> Inner White(0) block.\n5.  **Color Mapping Rule:** Let's denote the color of the outermost layer as C1, the next layer in as C2, and the third layer/innermost main color as C3.\n    *   `train_1`: C1=Azure(8), C2=White(0), C3=Gray(5). Output layers are Gray(5), Azure(8), White(0). This suggests the mapping: C1 -> C3, C2 -> C1, C3 -> C2.\n    *   `train_2`: C1=White(0), C2=Orange(7), C3=Magenta(6). Output layers are Magenta(6), White(0), Orange(7). This follows the same mapping: C1 -> C3, C2 -> C1, C3 -> C2.\n    *   `train_3`: C1=Green(3), C2=Red(2), C3=White(0). Output layers are White(0), Green(3), Red(2). Again, this follows the mapping: C1 -> C3, C2 -> C1, C3 -> C2.\n6.  **Innermost Region Handling:**\n    *   In `train_1`, the innermost Azure(8) pixels become Gray(5) (which is the *new* color of the outermost layer, C3). The innermost White(0) pixels remain White(0).\n    *   In `train_2`, the innermost Magenta(6) pixels (C3) become Orange(7) (C2). This is consistent with the main rule C3 -> C2.\n    *   In `train_3`, the innermost White(0) pixels (C3) become Red(2) (C2). This is also consistent with the main rule C3 -> C2.\n    *   It seems the rule is slightly different for `train_1`. Let's re-evaluate C3 for `train_1`. The *frame* is Gray(5), but the *content* inside that frame consists of Azure(8) and White(0). If we strictly follow the pixel colors:\n        *   Pixels with color C1 (Azure 8) become color C3 (Gray 5).\n        *   Pixels with color C2 (White 0, the frame) become color C1 (Azure 8).\n        *   Pixels with color C3 (Gray 5, the frame) become color C2 (White 0).\n        *   Pixels inside the C3 frame: If original color is Azure 8, they become Gray 5 (C3). If original color is White 0, they remain White 0.\n    *   This refined rule holds for all examples: pixels matching C1, C2, C3 change according to the cycle (C1->C3, C2->C1, C3->C2). Pixels *enclosed* by the shape formed by C3 pixels change color *if they are not White(0)*, taking on the color C3. Otherwise (if White 0), they remain White 0.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
