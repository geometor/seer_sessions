    1. Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
    2. Create an intermediate grid with dimensions (2*H) x (2*W) by tiling the
       input grid 2 times horizontally and 2 times vertically.
    3. Create a final output grid, initially a copy of the intermediate grid.
    4. Iterate through each pixel (r, c) in the intermediate grid.
    5. If the pixel at (r, c) is white (0):
       a. Examine its 8 neighbors (Moore neighborhood) in the intermediate grid.
       b. If any neighbor is non-white (not 0), change the pixel at (r, c)
