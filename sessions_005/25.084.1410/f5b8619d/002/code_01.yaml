task_description: Tile a modified version of the input grid 2x2 to produce the output grid.
grid_transformation:
  - operation: modify_grid
    source: input_grid
    target: base_grid
    rule: Change specific white pixels to azure.
  - operation: tile
    source: base_grid
    target: output_grid
    factors: [2, 2] # Tile 2x vertically, 2x horizontally
modification_rule:
  input_pixels: white (0)
  output_pixels: azure (8)
  condition: A white pixel is changed to azure if it is diagonally adjacent (shares only a corner) with any non-white pixel (color 1-9) in the input grid.
  neighborhood: Diagonal (4 neighbors: [-1,-1], [-1,1], [1,-1], [1,1])
preserved_pixels: All non-white pixels from the input grid, and white pixels that do not meet the modification condition, are preserved in the base_grid.
