"""
Transforms the input grid by creating a base grid and then tiling it 2x2.
The base grid is derived from the input grid by changing specific white pixels (0) to azure (8).
A white pixel in the input grid is changed to azure in the base grid if and only if it has at least one diagonally adjacent non-white pixel (1-9) in the input grid.
All other pixels retain their original color from the input grid when forming the base grid.
The final output grid is obtained by tiling the base grid 2 times vertically and 2 times horizontally.
