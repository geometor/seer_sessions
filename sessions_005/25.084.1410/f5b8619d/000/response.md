*   **Perception:**
    *   The task involves transforming an input grid into a larger output grid.
    *   The output grid dimensions are always double the input grid dimensions (height and width).
    *   The pattern suggests that the input grid is tiled 2x2 to create the basic structure of the output grid.
    *   After tiling, a color transformation occurs: some white pixels (0) in the tiled grid are changed to azure pixels (8).
    *   This color change seems dependent on the pixel's neighborhood. Specifically, white pixels that are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any non-white pixel become azure. Non-white pixels retain their original color.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task: grid_transformation
    observations:
      - input_grid:
          type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
          properties:
            - height: H
            - width: W
      - output_grid:
          type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
          properties:
            - height: 2 * H
            - width: 2 * W
    transformation:
      - name: tiling
        input: input_grid
        output: intermediate_grid (size 2H x 2W)
        details: Repeat the input_grid pattern 2 times horizontally and 2 times vertically.
      - name: color_change
        input: intermediate_grid
        output: final_output_grid
        details:
          - Iterate through each pixel (r, c) in the intermediate_grid.
          - If the pixel at (r, c) is white (0):
            - Check its 8 neighbors (Moore neighborhood).
            - If any neighbor is non-white (not 0):
              - Change the pixel at (r, c) in the final_output_grid to azure (8).
            - Else:
              - Keep the pixel at (r, c) as white (0) in the final_output_grid.
          - Else (if the pixel is non-white):
            - Keep the pixel's original color in the final_output_grid.
    relationships:
      - Output grid dimensions are double the input grid dimensions.
      - The initial content of the output grid is formed by tiling the input grid.
      - The final color of a white pixel depends on the color of its adjacent pixels (including diagonals) in the tiled grid.
    objects:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          - color (0-9)
          - position (row, column)
          - neighbors (adjacent pixels)
      - type: grid
        properties:
          - dimensions (height, width)
          - pixels
    constants:
      - white_color: 0
      - azure_color: 8
      - tiling_factor: 2x2
      - adjacency_type: Moore (8 neighbors)
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
    2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions (2\*H) x (2\*W).
    3.  Fill the output grid by tiling the input grid 2 times horizontally and 2 times vertically. This means the block of pixels from input grid coordinates (r, c) will be copied to output grid coordinates (r, c), (r, c+W), (r+H, c), and (r+H, c+W).
    4.  Create a final grid, initially identical to the tiled grid.
    5.  Iterate through each pixel position (row `out_r`, column `out_c`) in the tiled grid (from step 3).
    6.  If the pixel at (`out_r`, `out_c`) in the tiled grid is white (0):
        a.  Examine all 8 neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) of the pixel at (`out_r`, `out_c`) within the bounds of the tiled grid.
        b.  Check if any of these neighbors has a color different from white (0).
        c.  If at least one neighbor is non-white, set the color of the pixel at (`out_r`, `out_c`) in the final grid to azure (8).
    7.  Return the final grid.
