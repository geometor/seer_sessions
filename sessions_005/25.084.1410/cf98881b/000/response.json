These columns appear at indices 4 and 9.\n    *   These red columns act as delimiters, dividing the input grid into three 4x4 sections: Left (columns 0-3), Middle (columns 5-8), and Right (columns 10-13).\n    *   The red delimiter columns themselves are not present in the output grid.\n    *   The output grid seems to be a composite or overlay of the three 4x4 sections extracted from the input.\n    *   Comparing the sections pixel by pixel with the output suggests a specific overlay rule. White (0) pixels appear to be treated as transparent. When overlaying the Left, Middle, and Right sections, the pixel value from the *first* section (in the order Left -> Middle -> Right) that is *not* white determines the output pixel's value. If the corresponding pixels in all three sections are white, the output pixel is white.\n\n*   **Facts**\n    "
