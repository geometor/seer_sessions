*   **Perception**
    *   The input grids are consistently 4x14, while the output grids are 4x4.
    *   The input grids contain two distinct vertical columns composed entirely of red (2) pixels. These columns appear at indices 4 and 9.
    *   These red columns act as delimiters, dividing the input grid into three 4x4 sections: Left (columns 0-3), Middle (columns 5-8), and Right (columns 10-13).
    *   The red delimiter columns themselves are not present in the output grid.
    *   The output grid seems to be a composite or overlay of the three 4x4 sections extracted from the input.
    *   Comparing the sections pixel by pixel with the output suggests a specific overlay rule. White (0) pixels appear to be treated as transparent. When overlaying the Left, Middle, and Right sections, the pixel value from the *first* section (in the order Left -> Middle -> Right) that is *not* white determines the output pixel's value. If the corresponding pixels in all three sections are white, the output pixel is white.

        rule: For each pixel position (r, c), check the color in Left[r, c], then Middle[r, c], then Right[r, c]. The output pixel Output[r, c] takes the color of the first non-white pixel encountered in this sequence. If all are white, the output pixel is white.

*   **Natural Language Program**
    1.  Identify the two vertical columns consisting entirely of red (2) pixels in the input grid. Note their column indices (expected to be 4 and 9).
    2.  Define three 4x4 subgrids based on these delimiters:
        *   The "Left" section consists of columns 0 through 3 of the input grid.
        *   The "Middle" section consists of columns 5 through 8 of the input grid.
        *   The "Right" section consists of columns 10 through 13 of the input grid.
    3.  Create an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the sections (4x4).
    4.  Iterate through each cell position (row `r`, column `c`) from (0, 0) to (3, 3).
    5.  For the current position (r, c), examine the color of the pixel in the Left section at `Left[r, c]`.
    6.  If `Left[r, c]` is not white (0), set the output grid pixel `Output[r, c]` to the color of `Left[r, c]`.
    7.  If `Left[r, c]` *is* white (0), examine the color of the pixel in the Middle section at `Middle[r, c]`.
    8.  If `Middle[r, c]` is not white (0), set the output grid pixel `Output[r, c]` to the color of `Middle[r, c]`.
    9.  If `Middle[r, c]` *is* white (0), examine the color of the pixel in the Right section at `Right[r, c]`.
    10. Set the output grid pixel `Output[r, c]` to the color of `Right[r, c]` (this covers both cases where `Right[r, c]` is non-white or white, as if all three sections had white at this position, the output should be white).
    11. After iterating through all positions, the resulting output grid is the final transformation.
