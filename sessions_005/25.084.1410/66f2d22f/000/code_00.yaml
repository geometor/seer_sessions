task_description: Analyze a 4x14 input grid composed of a 4x7 left half (green shapes on white) and a 4x7 right half (red shapes on white) to produce a 4x7 output grid.
elements:
  - element: input_grid
    properties:
      height: 4
      width: 14
      colors_present: [white, green, red]
      structure: Composed of two conceptual 4x7 halves (left and right).
  - element: left_half
    source: input_grid columns 0-6
    properties:
      height: 4
      width: 7
      content: Green (3) shapes on a white (0) background.
  - element: right_half
    source: input_grid columns 7-13
    properties:
      height: 4
      width: 7
      content: Red (2) shapes on a white (0) background.
  - element: output_grid
    properties:
      height: 4
      width: 7
      colors_present: [white, gray]
transformation:
  type: element-wise comparison
  input_elements: [left_half, right_half]
  output_element: output_grid
  rule: For each coordinate (r, c) from (0, 0) to (3, 6):
    - Compare the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the left_half (input[r][c]).
    - Compare the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the right_half (input[r][c + 7]).
    - If both input pixels are white (0), the output pixel at (r, c) becomes gray (5).
    - Otherwise, the output pixel at (r, c) becomes white (0).
relationship:
  - type: spatial correspondence
    elements: [left_half, right_half, output_grid]
    details: The pixel at (r, c) in the output grid is determined by the pixels at (r, c) in the left half and (r, c + 7) in the input grid (which corresponds to (r,c) in the right half).
