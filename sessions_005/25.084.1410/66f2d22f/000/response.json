The output grids are consistently 4 rows by 7 columns. The output grid has the same height but half the width of the input grid.\n2.  **Color Palette:**\n    *   Input grids use white (0), green (3), and red (2).\n    *   Output grids use white (0) and gray (5).\n3.  **Input Structure:** The input grid appears to be composed of two distinct halves placed side-by-side.\n    *   The left half (columns 0-6) contains patterns made of green (3) pixels on a white (0) background.\n    *   The right half (columns 7-13) contains patterns made of red (2) pixels on a white (0) background.\n4.  **Transformation:** The output grid seems to be derived by comparing the left and right halves of the input grid pixel by pixel. Specifically, a pixel in the output grid at position `(r, c)` gets a specific color based on the colors of the input pixels at `(r, c)` (in the left half) and `(r, c + 7)` (in the right half).\n5.  **Rule Identification:** Observing the examples, a gray (5) pixel appears in the output grid at `(r, c)` *only* when *both* the corresponding input pixel in the left half (`input[r][c]`) and the corresponding input pixel in the right half (`input[r][c + 7]`) are white (0). In all other cases (where at least one of the corresponding input pixels is non-white), the output pixel at `(r, c)` is white (0).\n\n### YAML Facts\n\n"
