Okay, let's analyze the task.

### Perception

1.  **Grid Dimensions:** The input grids are consistently 4 rows by 14 columns. The output grids are consistently 4 rows by 7 columns. The output grid has the same height but half the width of the input grid.
2.  **Color Palette:**
    *   Input grids use white (0), green (3), and red (2).
    *   Output grids use white (0) and gray (5).
3.  **Input Structure:** The input grid appears to be composed of two distinct halves placed side-by-side.
    *   The left half (columns 0-6) contains patterns made of green (3) pixels on a white (0) background.
    *   The right half (columns 7-13) contains patterns made of red (2) pixels on a white (0) background.
4.  **Transformation:** The output grid seems to be derived by comparing the left and right halves of the input grid pixel by pixel. Specifically, a pixel in the output grid at position `(r, c)` gets a specific color based on the colors of the input pixels at `(r, c)` (in the left half) and `(r, c + 7)` (in the right half).
5.  **Rule Identification:** Observing the examples, a gray (5) pixel appears in the output grid at `(r, c)` *only* when *both* the corresponding input pixel in the left half (`input[r][c]`) and the corresponding input pixel in the right half (`input[r][c + 7]`) are white (0). In all other cases (where at least one of the corresponding input pixels is non-white), the output pixel at `(r, c)` is white (0).

### YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Analyze a 4x14 input grid composed of a 4x7 left half (green shapes on white) and a 4x7 right half (red shapes on white) to produce a 4x7 output grid.
elements:
  - element: input_grid
    properties:
      height: 4
      width: 14
      colors_present: [white, green, red]
      structure: Composed of two conceptual 4x7 halves (left and right).
  - element: left_half
    source: input_grid columns 0-6
    properties:
      height: 4
      width: 7
      content: Green (3) shapes on a white (0) background.
  - element: right_half
    source: input_grid columns 7-13
    properties:
      height: 4
      width: 7
      content: Red (2) shapes on a white (0) background.
  - element: output_grid
    properties:
      height: 4
      width: 7
      colors_present: [white, gray]
transformation:
  type: element-wise comparison
  input_elements: [left_half, right_half]
  output_element: output_grid
  rule: For each coordinate (r, c) from (0, 0) to (3, 6):
    - Compare the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the left_half (input[r][c]).
    - Compare the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the right_half (input[r][c + 7]).
    - If both input pixels are white (0), the output pixel at (r, c) becomes gray (5).
    - Otherwise, the output pixel at (r, c) becomes white (0).
relationship:
  - type: spatial correspondence
    elements: [left_half, right_half, output_grid]
    details: The pixel at (r, c) in the output grid is determined by the pixels at (r, c) in the left half and (r, c + 7) in the input grid (which corresponds to (r,c) in the right half).
```


### Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input grid (which has height H and width W, where W is known to be 14 for these examples).
2.  Calculate the width of the output grid, `output_width = W / 2`.
3.  Create a new output grid with dimensions H rows and `output_width` columns, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
4.  Iterate through each row `r` from 0 to H-1.
5.  Inside the row loop, iterate through each column `c` from 0 to `output_width`-1.
6.  For the current `(r, c)`, examine the color of the pixel in the input grid at `(r, c)` (let's call it `left_pixel_color`).
7.  Examine the color of the pixel in the input grid at `(r, c + output_width)` (let's call it `right_pixel_color`).
8.  Check if `left_pixel_color` is white (0) AND `right_pixel_color` is white (0).
9.  If the condition in step 8 is true, set the pixel in the output grid at `(r, c)` to gray (5).
10. If the condition in step 8 is false, ensure the pixel in the output grid at `(r, c)` remains white (0).
11. After iterating through all rows and columns, return the completed output grid.
