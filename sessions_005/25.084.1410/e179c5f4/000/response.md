Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Dimensions:** The input and output grids always have the same dimensions (height H, width W). The examples show grids of 10x3, 10x2, and 10x4.
2.  **Input Content:** The input grids consist almost entirely of `white` (0) pixels. There is a single `blue` (1) pixel located at the bottom-left corner (row H-1, column 0) in all training examples.
3.  **Output Content:** The output grids are filled with `azure` (8) pixels and `blue` (1) pixels.
4.  **Pattern:** In the output grids, there is exactly one `blue` (1) pixel in each row. All other pixels are `azure` (8).
5.  **Blue Pixel Movement:** The column position of the `blue` (1) pixel changes from row to row, creating a vertical zigzag or bouncing pattern.
    *   Example 1 (W=3): Blue column indices are 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0.
    *   Example 2 (W=2): Blue column indices are 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0.
    *   Example 3 (W=4): Blue column indices are 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0.
6.  **Zigzag Logic:** The pattern starts at a specific column in the first row (row 0). It then moves one step horizontally (initially left, direction `d=-1`). When the pattern hits the left edge (column 0) or the right edge (column W-1), the horizontal direction reverses (`d` becomes `-d`).
7.  **Starting Column:** The starting column (`c_start` for row 0) depends on the width `W` of the grid:
    *   If `W` is odd, `c_start = W // 2` (integer division, the middle column).
    *   If `W` is even, `c_start = W - 1` (the rightmost column).
8.  **Input Blue Pixel Role:** The `blue` (1) pixel in the input seems to serve only as an indicator that this transformation rule should be applied, or perhaps its presence confirms the grid structure. Its specific position (bottom-left) does not seem to directly influence the output pattern's calculation, other than perhaps confirming H and W.

        If next_column < 0 or next_column >= W:
          Reverse direction (direction = -direction).
          Recalculate next_column = current_column + direction.
        Update current_column = next_column.

    logic: |
      For each coordinate (r, c) in the list:
        Set output_grid[r, c] = blue (1)
relationships:
  - input_output_dimensions: input and output grids have identical height (H) and width (W).
  - pattern_dependency: The zigzag pattern's starting column depends on the grid width (W) parity (even/odd).
  - color_mapping: Input white (0) pixels are replaced by either azure (8) or blue (1) based on the zigzag pattern. The input blue (1) pixel's location doesn't directly map to an output pixel's color or position in the pattern calculation.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions (H x W) and fill it entirely with `azure` (8) pixels.
3.  Calculate the starting column index (`start_col`) for the pattern in the first row (row 0). If the width `W` is even, set `start_col` to `W - 1`. If `W` is odd, set `start_col` to `W // 2`.
4.  Initialize a variable `current_col` to `start_col`.
5.  Initialize a variable `direction` to `-1` (representing movement to the left).
6.  Iterate through each row index `r` from 0 to `H - 1`:
    a.  Set the pixel in the output grid at position (`r`, `current_col`) to `blue` (1).
    b.  Calculate the potential next column index: `next_col = current_col + direction`.
    c.  Check if `next_col` is outside the grid boundaries (i.e., `next_col < 0` or `next_col >= W`).
    d.  If `next_col` is outside the boundaries:
        i.  Reverse the `direction` (multiply `direction` by -1).
        ii. Recalculate `next_col` using the new `direction`: `next_col = current_col + direction`.
    e.  Update `current_col` to `next_col` for the next row's calculation.
7.  Return the completed output grid.
