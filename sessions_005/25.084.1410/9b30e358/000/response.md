Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consist of a background color filling a large portion of the grid, typically the top part. Below this background area, there is a distinct pattern composed of other colors.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. The content of the output grid is derived entirely from the pattern found in the input grid, tiled vertically. The original background-only area from the input is replaced.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves:
    *   Identifying the background color.
    *   Isolating the block of rows containing the non-background pattern. Let's call this the "pattern block".
    *   Determining the height of this pattern block.
    *   Applying a rule based on whether the pattern block's height is odd or even:
        *   **Odd Height:** The pattern block is simply repeated vertically to fill the output grid.
        *   **Even Height:** The pattern block is split vertically into two equal halves (top and bottom). These halves are swapped (bottom half placed first, then top half). This swapped sequence is then repeated vertically to fill the output grid.
4.  **Dimensions:** The height and width of the output grid are identical to the input grid.

## Facts


```yaml
- task: Analyze input grid structure and identify pattern block based on colors.
- facts:
    - input_grid: A 2D array of color values.
    - output_grid: A 2D array of color values with the same dimensions as input_grid.
    - background_color:
        - definition: The color that occupies the largest area, often forming a contiguous block. Can be found by identifying the most frequent color in the grid.
        - example_1: Gray (5)
        - example_2: Green (3)
    - pattern_block:
        - definition: The minimal contiguous block of rows containing all pixels that are *not* the background_color.
        - identification: Find the minimum row index (`min_row`) and maximum row index (`max_row`) containing non-background pixels. The block consists of input rows from `min_row` to `max_row` inclusive.
        - properties:
            - rows: A list or sequence of 1D arrays representing the rows of the pattern.
            - height (H_p): The number of rows in the pattern block (`max_row` - `min_row` + 1).
        - example_1:
            - rows: Input rows 5 through 9.
            - height: 5
        - example_2:
            - rows: Input rows 6 through 9.
            - height: 4
    - transformation_rule:
        - condition: Based on the parity of pattern_block.height (H_p).
        - case_odd_height:
            - source_sequence: The pattern_block rows in their original order.
            - action: Repeat the source_sequence vertically until the output grid height is filled.
            - example: train_1 (H_p=5). Output is rows (5-9) repeated twice.
        - case_even_height:
            - preparation: Split pattern_block into top_half (first H_p/2 rows) and bottom_half (last H_p/2 rows).
            - source_sequence: Concatenate bottom_half followed by top_half.
            - action: Repeat the source_sequence vertically until the output grid height is filled.
            - example: train_2 (H_p=4). Split into rows (6,7) and (8,9). Swapped sequence is (8,9,6,7). Output repeats this sequence 2.5 times.
    - output_generation:
        - dimensions: Same height (H_in) and width (W_in) as the input grid.
        - content: Filled row by row using the appropriate source_sequence determined by the transformation_rule, repeating the sequence as needed. The i-th row of the output is the `(i % sequence_length)`-th row of the source_sequence.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the dimensions (height `H_in`, width `W_in`) of the input grid.
2.  Identify the `background_color` by finding the most frequent color value in the input grid.
3.  Scan the input grid row by row to find the first row (`min_row`) and the last row (`max_row`) that contain at least one pixel whose color is *not* the `background_color`.
4.  If no non-background pixels are found (`min_row` or `max_row` is undefined), the output grid is identical to the input grid. Stop.
5.  Extract the "pattern block" consisting of all rows from `min_row` to `max_row` inclusive. Let the height of this block be `H_p = max_row - min_row + 1`.
6.  Check if `H_p` is odd or even.
7.  If `H_p` is odd:
    *   Set the `source_sequence` to be the rows of the pattern block in their original order.
8.  If `H_p` is even:
    *   Calculate `half_height = H_p / 2`.
    *   Split the pattern block into `top_half` (the first `half_height` rows) and `bottom_half` (the last `half_height` rows).
    *   Set the `source_sequence` by concatenating the `bottom_half` rows followed by the `top_half` rows.
9.  Let the length of the `source_sequence` (number of rows in it) be `L_s`.
10. Create a new output grid with height `H_in` and width `W_in`.
11. Fill the output grid row by row: For each output row index `i` from 0 to `H_in - 1`, copy the row from `source_sequence` at index `(i % L_s)` into the output grid's `i`-th row.
12. Return the generated output grid.
