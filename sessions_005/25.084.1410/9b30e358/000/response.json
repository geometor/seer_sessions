            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consist of a background color filling a large portion of the grid, typically the top part. Below this background area, there is a distinct pattern composed of other colors.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. The content of the output grid is derived entirely from the pattern found in the input grid, tiled vertically. The original background-only area from the input is replaced.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves:\n    *   Identifying the background color.\n    *   Isolating the block of rows containing the non-background pattern. Let's call this the \"pattern block\".\n    *   Determining the height of this pattern block.\n    *   Applying a rule based on whether the pattern block's height is odd or even:\n        *   **Odd Height:** The pattern block is simply repeated vertically to fill the output grid.\n        *   **Even Height:** The pattern block is split vertically into two equal halves (top and bottom). These halves are swapped (bottom half placed first, then top half). This swapped sequence is then repeated vertically to fill the output grid.\n4.  **Dimensions:** The height and width of the output grid are identical to the input grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
