            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid consists of a uniform background color filling the entire grid, except for a single pixel of a different color (let's call this the 'special pixel').\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. It retains the background color and the special pixel in their original positions. Additionally, several pixels are changed to blue (1).\n3.  **Special Pixel:** The special pixel's color and location remain unchanged between the input and output grids. It acts as a reference point for the transformation.\n4.  **Blue Pixel Pattern:** The blue pixels in the output form a specific pattern originating from the column of the special pixel.\n    *   A vertical line of blue pixels extends upwards and downwards from the special pixel's location towards the top and bottom edges of the grid, respectively. The special pixel itself is *not* changed to blue.\n    *   From the top end of this vertical line (at row 0), a horizontal line of blue pixels extends either left or right along the top edge (row 0) to the grid boundary.\n    *   From the bottom end of this vertical line (at the last row), a horizontal line of blue pixels extends either left or right along the bottom edge (last row) to the grid boundary.\n5.  **Horizontal Line Direction:** The direction of the horizontal blue lines (left or right) appears to depend on the row index of the special pixel:\n    *   If the special pixel's row index is *odd*, the top horizontal line goes left, and the bottom horizontal line goes right. (Seen in train_1 where r=3, train_3 where r=3)\n    *   If the special pixel's row index is *even*, the top horizontal line goes right, and the bottom horizontal line goes left. (Seen in train_2 where r=2)\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
