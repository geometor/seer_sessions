Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid consists of a uniform background color filling the entire grid, except for a single pixel of a different color (let's call this the 'special pixel').
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. It retains the background color and the special pixel in their original positions. Additionally, several pixels are changed to blue (1).
3.  **Special Pixel:** The special pixel's color and location remain unchanged between the input and output grids. It acts as a reference point for the transformation.
4.  **Blue Pixel Pattern:** The blue pixels in the output form a specific pattern originating from the column of the special pixel.
    *   A vertical line of blue pixels extends upwards and downwards from the special pixel's location towards the top and bottom edges of the grid, respectively. The special pixel itself is *not* changed to blue.
    *   From the top end of this vertical line (at row 0), a horizontal line of blue pixels extends either left or right along the top edge (row 0) to the grid boundary.
    *   From the bottom end of this vertical line (at the last row), a horizontal line of blue pixels extends either left or right along the bottom edge (last row) to the grid boundary.
5.  **Horizontal Line Direction:** The direction of the horizontal blue lines (left or right) appears to depend on the row index of the special pixel:
    *   If the special pixel's row index is *odd*, the top horizontal line goes left, and the bottom horizontal line goes right. (Seen in train_1 where r=3, train_3 where r=3)
    *   If the special pixel's row index is *even*, the top horizontal line goes right, and the bottom horizontal line goes left. (Seen in train_2 where r=2)

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: "Transform a grid by drawing blue paths originating from a single special pixel against a uniform background."

elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: input
      - type: output
      - dimensions: height (H), width (W) # Same for input and output
  - object: background
    properties:
      - type: pixel_color
      - uniformity: covers most of the input grid
      - persistence: remains largely unchanged in the output grid, except where replaced by blue pixels
  - object: special_pixel
    properties:
      - type: pixel_color (distinct from background)
      - count: exactly one in the input grid
      - location: (row r, column c)
      - persistence: color and location are identical in input and output grids
  - object: blue_pixels
    properties:
      - type: pixel_color (value 1)
      - presence: only in the output grid
      - formation: form specific paths related to the special_pixel location

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The blue pixels form paths connected to the column of the special_pixel.
    details:
      - A vertical path runs in the special_pixel's column (c), from row 0 to H-1, excluding the special_pixel's row (r).
      - A horizontal path runs along the top edge (row 0), connecting the vertical path's end (0, c) to either the left edge (column 0) or the right edge (column W-1).
      - A horizontal path runs along the bottom edge (row H-1), connecting the vertical path's end (H-1, c) to either the left edge (column 0) or the right edge (column W-1).
  - type: conditional
    description: The direction of the horizontal blue paths depends on the row index (r) of the special_pixel.
    condition: r % 2 (parity of the special pixel's row index)
    outcomes:
      - if r is odd:
          - top horizontal path goes left (from column c-1 down to 0).
          - bottom horizontal path goes right (from column c+1 up to W-1).
      - if r is even:
          - top horizontal path goes right (from column c+1 up to W-1).
          - bottom horizontal path goes left (from column c-1 down to 0).

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: special_pixel
    result: location (r, c) and color
  - action: identify
    target: background
    result: color
  - action: generate
    target: output_grid
    steps:
      - Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid.
      - Draw vertical blue path: For i from 0 to H-1, if i is not r, set output_grid[i][c] = 1.
      - Check parity of r.
      - Draw horizontal paths based on parity (as described in relationships.conditional).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the single pixel in the input grid that has a different color from the surrounding background pixels. Note its row index `r`, column index `c`, and its color.
2.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
3.  Iterate through all rows `i` from 0 to the grid height minus 1. If the current row `i` is *not* equal to the special pixel's row `r`, change the color of the pixel at `(i, c)` in the output grid to blue (1).
4.  Check if the special pixel's row index `r` is odd or even.
5.  **If `r` is odd:**
    *   Draw a horizontal blue line along the top edge (row 0) starting from column `c-1` and going leftwards to column 0. Change the pixels `(0, j)` to blue (1) for `j` from `c-1` down to 0.
    *   Draw a horizontal blue line along the bottom edge (last row) starting from column `c+1` and going rightwards to the last column. Change the pixels `(H-1, j)` to blue (1) for `j` from `c+1` up to `W-1`.
6.  **If `r` is even:**
    *   Draw a horizontal blue line along the top edge (row 0) starting from column `c+1` and going rightwards to the last column. Change the pixels `(0, j)` to blue (1) for `j` from `c+1` up to `W-1`.
    *   Draw a horizontal blue line along the bottom edge (last row) starting from column `c-1` and going leftwards to column 0. Change the pixels `(H-1, j)` to blue (1) for `j` from `c-1` down to 0.
7.  The resulting grid is the final output.
