task_description: "Transform a grid by drawing blue paths originating from a single special pixel against a uniform background."

elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: input
      - type: output
      - dimensions: height (H), width (W) # Same for input and output
  - object: background
    properties:
      - type: pixel_color
      - uniformity: covers most of the input grid
      - persistence: remains largely unchanged in the output grid, except where replaced by blue pixels
  - object: special_pixel
    properties:
      - type: pixel_color (distinct from background)
      - count: exactly one in the input grid
      - location: (row r, column c)
      - persistence: color and location are identical in input and output grids
  - object: blue_pixels
    properties:
      - type: pixel_color (value 1)
      - presence: only in the output grid
      - formation: form specific paths related to the special_pixel location

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The blue pixels form paths connected to the column of the special_pixel.
    details:
      - A vertical path runs in the special_pixel's column (c), from row 0 to H-1, excluding the special_pixel's row (r).
      - A horizontal path runs along the top edge (row 0), connecting the vertical path's end (0, c) to either the left edge (column 0) or the right edge (column W-1).
      - A horizontal path runs along the bottom edge (row H-1), connecting the vertical path's end (H-1, c) to either the left edge (column 0) or the right edge (column W-1).
  - type: conditional
    description: The direction of the horizontal blue paths depends on the row index (r) of the special_pixel.
    condition: r % 2 (parity of the special pixel's row index)
    outcomes:
      - if r is odd:
          - top horizontal path goes left (from column c-1 down to 0).
          - bottom horizontal path goes right (from column c+1 up to W-1).
      - if r is even:
          - top horizontal path goes right (from column c+1 up to W-1).
          - bottom horizontal path goes left (from column c-1 down to 0).

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: special_pixel
    result: location (r, c) and color
  - action: identify
    target: background
    result: color
  - action: generate
    target: output_grid
    steps:
      - Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid.
      - Draw vertical blue path: For i from 0 to H-1, if i is not r, set output_grid[i][c] = 1.
      - Check parity of r.
      - Draw horizontal paths based on parity (as described in relationships.conditional).
