task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - size_preservation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
    - background_color: Orange (7) acts as a static background.
  object_identification:
    - criteria: Connected components of non-orange pixels (using 8-way adjacency).
    - target_object_property: Components whose bounding box dimensions are exactly 3x3.
transformation:
  locality: Changes occur only within the 3x3 bounding boxes of the identified target objects.
  rule:
    - type: Rotation (within the 3x3 bounding box)
    - direction: Counter-clockwise
    - elements: The 8 perimeter pixels of the 3x3 box.
    - invariant: The central pixel of the 3x3 box remains unchanged.
  application: Apply this rotation independently to each identified 3x3 target region.
  default_behavior: Pixels outside the identified 3x3 target regions remain unchanged.
