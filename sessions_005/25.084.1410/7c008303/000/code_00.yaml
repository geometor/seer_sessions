task_description: Recolor a 6x6 binary pattern based on color pairs found elsewhere in the input grid.

components:
  - type: grid_divider
    properties:
      color: azure (8)
      orientation: horizontal
      location: Variable row index, spans full width.
      function: Separates the input grid into two regions.

  - type: pattern_block
    properties:
      size: 6x6
      composition: Contains only green (3) and white (0) pixels.
      location: Found either entirely above or entirely below the azure divider.
      function: Defines the shape/structure for the output grid. Green pixels indicate where colors should be placed.

  - type: color_pair_block
    properties:
      size: 2x2
      composition: Contains four pixels, none of which are azure (8) or white (0).
      location: Found on the opposite side of the azure divider relative to the pattern_block.
      function: Provides two pairs of colors for recoloring the pattern_block.
        - Pair 1: Top row of the 2x2 block (ColorA1, ColorB1)
        - Pair 2: Bottom row of the 2x2 block (ColorA2, ColorB2)

  - type: output_grid
    properties:
      size: 6x6
      derivation: Based on the pattern_block and color_pair_block.

transformation:
  - action: locate
    target: azure (8) horizontal line
    result: Row index R of the divider.
  - action: locate
    target: 6x6 block containing only green (3) and white (0)
    result: The Pattern Block grid P.
  - action: locate
    target: 2x2 block of non-azure/non-white pixels on the opposite side of row R from the Pattern Block.
    result: Color pairs (ColorA1, ColorB1) and (ColorA2, ColorB2).
  - action: generate_output
    target: 6x6 grid O
    rule: |
      For each cell (r, c) in the Pattern Block P:
      If P[r, c] is white (0), then O[r, c] is white (0).
      If P[r, c] is green (3):
        If r < 3 and c < 3 (top-left quadrant), O[r, c] = ColorA1.
        If r < 3 and c >= 3 (top-right quadrant), O[r, c] = ColorB1.
        If r >= 3 and c < 3 (bottom-left quadrant), O[r, c] = ColorA2.
        If r >= 3 and c >= 3 (bottom-right quadrant), O[r, c] = ColorB2.

relationships:
  - type: spatial_separation
    item1: pattern_block
    item2: color_pair_block
