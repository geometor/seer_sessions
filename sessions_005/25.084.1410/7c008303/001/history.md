Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** All input grids are 9x9.
2.  **Azure Line Divider:** Each input grid contains a single horizontal line composed entirely of azure (8) pixels. This line acts as a separator, dividing the grid into an upper and a lower section.
3.  **Key Information Blocks:** There are two key blocks of information present in each input grid, located on opposite sides of the azure divider:
    *   **Pattern Block:** A 6x6 block composed solely of green (3) and white (0) pixels. This block defines the structure or shape for the output.
    *   **Color Pair Block:** A 2x2 block containing four non-azure, non-white pixels. These four pixels define the colors to be used in the output, organized into two pairs.
4.  **Output Grid Structure:** All output grids are 6x6.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The output grid seems to be generated by taking the 6x6 green/white pattern block and "coloring it in" based on the two color pairs from the 2x2 block. The pattern is split into four quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right, where top/bottom is split between rows 0-2 and 3-5, and left/right is split between columns 0-2 and 3-5). The coloring uses the pairs based on the quadrant.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Recolor a 6x6 binary pattern based on color pairs found elsewhere in the input grid.

components:
  - type: grid_divider
    properties:
      color: azure (8)
      orientation: horizontal
      location: Variable row index, spans full width.
      function: Separates the input grid into two regions.

  - type: pattern_block
    properties:
      size: 6x6
      composition: Contains only green (3) and white (0) pixels.
      location: Found either entirely above or entirely below the azure divider.
      function: Defines the shape/structure for the output grid. Green pixels indicate where colors should be placed.

  - type: color_pair_block
    properties:
      size: 2x2
      composition: Contains four pixels, none of which are azure (8) or white (0).
      location: Found on the opposite side of the azure divider relative to the pattern_block.
      function: Provides two pairs of colors for recoloring the pattern_block.
        - Pair 1: Top row of the 2x2 block (ColorA1, ColorB1)
        - Pair 2: Bottom row of the 2x2 block (ColorA2, ColorB2)

  - type: output_grid
    properties:
      size: 6x6
      derivation: Based on the pattern_block and color_pair_block.

transformation:
  - action: locate
    target: azure (8) horizontal line
    result: Row index R of the divider.
  - action: locate
    target: 6x6 block containing only green (3) and white (0)
    result: The Pattern Block grid P.
  - action: locate
    target: 2x2 block of non-azure/non-white pixels on the opposite side of row R from the Pattern Block.
    result: Color pairs (ColorA1, ColorB1) and (ColorA2, ColorB2).
  - action: generate_output
    target: 6x6 grid O
    rule: |
      For each cell (r, c) in the Pattern Block P:
      If P[r, c] is white (0), then O[r, c] is white (0).
      If P[r, c] is green (3):
        If r < 3 and c < 3 (top-left quadrant), O[r, c] = ColorA1.
        If r < 3 and c >= 3 (top-right quadrant), O[r, c] = ColorB1.
        If r >= 3 and c < 3 (bottom-left quadrant), O[r, c] = ColorA2.
        If r >= 3 and c >= 3 (bottom-right quadrant), O[r, c] = ColorB2.

relationships:
  - type: spatial_separation
    item1: pattern_block
    item2: color_pair_block
    via: azure (8) divider line
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Divider:** Find the horizontal row composed entirely of azure (8) pixels. Note its row index.
2.  **Locate the Pattern:** Find the 6x6 subgrid within the input that consists only of green (3) and white (0) pixels. Note whether this pattern block is above or below the azure divider line.
3.  **Locate the Color Pairs:** Find the 2x2 subgrid located on the opposite side of the azure divider from the pattern block. This 2x2 block contains four non-azure, non-white pixels.
4.  **Extract Color Pairs:** Read the colors from the 2x2 block row by row. The top row defines the first color pair (ColorA1, ColorB1), and the bottom row defines the second color pair (ColorA2, ColorB2).
5.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize a new 6x6 grid, initially empty or filled with white (0).
6.  **Apply Coloring Rule:** Iterate through each cell (row `r`, column `c`) of the 6x6 pattern block identified in step 2:
    *   If the pattern cell contains white (0), leave the corresponding cell in the output grid as white (0).
    *   If the pattern cell contains green (3), determine the output color based on the cell's position within the 6x6 grid:
        *   If `r` is 0, 1, or 2 (top half) AND `c` is 0, 1, or 2 (left half): Use ColorA1.
        *   If `r` is 0, 1, or 2 (top half) AND `c` is 3, 4, or 5 (right half): Use ColorB1.
        *   If `r` is 3, 4, or 5 (bottom half) AND `c` is 0, 1, or 2 (left half): Use ColorA2.
        *   If `r` is 3, 4, or 5 (bottom half) AND `c` is 3, 4, or 5 (right half): Use ColorB2.
    *   Place the determined color into the corresponding cell (row `r`, column `c`) of the output grid.
7.  **Finalize:** The resulting 6x6 grid is the final output.
