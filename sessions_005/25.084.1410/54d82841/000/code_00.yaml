task_description: Identify U-shaped objects and place a marker below them in the last row.

elements:
  - element_type: background
    color: white (0)
    properties: Fills the space not occupied by objects. Remains unchanged in the output.

  - element_type: object
    name: U-shape
    structure:
      - A 3x2 pattern of a single non-white color (C).
      - Arrangement:
          C C C
          C 0 C
    properties:
      - color: non-white (e.g., green, magenta, azure)
      - central_gap_column: The column index of the white pixel (0) within the U-shape's 3x2 area.
    persistence: Remains unchanged in the output.

actions:
  - action: add_pixel
    target_element: output_grid
    pixel_color: yellow (4)
    condition: For each identified U-shape in the input.
    placement_rule:
      row: last row index of the grid.
      column: the 'central_gap_column' of the corresponding U-shape.

relationships:
  - type: positional
    description: The column position of the added yellow pixel is determined by the column position of the central gap of a U-shape object.
  - type: positional
    description: The row position of the added yellow pixel is always the last row of the grid.
