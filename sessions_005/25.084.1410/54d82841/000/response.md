Okay, let's break down the transformation.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure**: The input grids contain one or more "U-shaped" objects. These objects are composed of a single non-white color (green, magenta, or azure in the examples). The U-shape is consistently 3 pixels wide and 2 pixels high, with a gap in the bottom-center position. The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels (0).
2.  **Output Structure**: The output grids are identical to the input grids, with the addition of one or more yellow pixels (4).
3.  **Transformation**: The transformation involves identifying each U-shaped object in the input and adding a single yellow pixel to the output grid based on the U-shape's location.
4.  **Placement Rule**: For each U-shaped object found in the input, a yellow pixel is placed in the output grid. The yellow pixel's location is always in the *last row* of the grid. The column index of the yellow pixel corresponds exactly to the column index of the *central gap* (the white pixel) within the U-shape.
5.  **Object Persistence**: The original U-shaped objects and the background white pixels remain unchanged in the output.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each possible top-left corner `(r, c)` of a 3x2 bounding box within the input grid (up to `height-2` for rows and `width-3` for columns).
3.  For each potential top-left corner `(r, c)`:
    a.  Check if the 3x2 area starting at `(r, c)` forms a "U-shape". A U-shape is defined as:
        i.  Pixels at `(r, c)`, `(r, c+1)`, `(r, c+2)`, `(r+1, c)`, and `(r+1, c+2)` are all the same non-white color.
        ii. Pixel at `(r+1, c+1)` is white (0).
    b.  If a U-shape is found:
        i.  Identify the color `C` of the U-shape.
        ii. Identify the column index of the central gap: `gap_col = c + 1`.
        iii. Determine the last row index of the grid: `last_row = grid_height - 1`.
        iv. Place a yellow pixel (4) in the output grid at position `(last_row, gap_col)`.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
