These objects are composed of a single non-white color (green, magenta, or azure in the examples). The U-shape is consistently 3 pixels wide and 2 pixels high, with a gap in the bottom-center position. The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels (0).\n2.  **Output Structure**: The output grids are identical to the input grids, with the addition of one or more yellow pixels (4).\n3.  **Transformation**: The transformation involves identifying each U-shaped object in the input and adding a single yellow pixel to the output grid based on the U-shape's location.\n4.  **Placement Rule**: For each U-shaped object found in the input, a yellow pixel is placed in the output grid. The yellow pixel's location is always in the *last row* of the grid. The column index of the yellow pixel corresponds exactly to the column index of the *central gap* (the white pixel) within the U-shape.\n5.  **Object Persistence**: The original U-shaped objects and the background white pixels remain unchanged in the output.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
