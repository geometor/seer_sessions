task_elements:
  - background:
      color: white
      value: 0
  - pixels:
      description: Individual cells with colors other than white. Treated as point objects.
      colors_involved: [yellow, orange, blue, azure]
      values_involved: [4, 7, 1, 8]
      other_colors_present: [magenta, red, green, gray, maroon] # Appear but are not part of the core transformation
      values_not_involved: [6, 2, 3, 5, 9]

relationships:
  - type: horizontal_pairing
    description: Specific color pairs occurring within the same row.
    pairs:
      - [yellow (4), orange (7)]
      - [blue (1), azure (8)]
    condition:
      - Exactly one of each color from the pair must be present in the row.
      - All pixels strictly between the pair must be white (0).

actions:
  - type: horizontal_movement
    description: One pixel from a qualifying pair moves horizontally to become adjacent to the other pixel in the pair.
    actor_determination:
      - If pair is (4, 7):
          - If 4 is left, 7 moves.
          - If 7 is left, 4 moves.
      - If pair is (1, 8):
          - If 1 is left, 8 moves.
          - If 8 is left, 1 moves.
    target_position: The column immediately to the right of the stationary pixel (anchor).
    result:
      - Moved pixel occupies the target position.
      - Original position of the moved pixel becomes white (0).
      - Anchor pixel remains unchanged.
  - type: no_change
    description: Pixels not part of a qualifying pair, or rows not meeting the pairing conditions, remain unchanged.

grid_properties:
  - scope: row-based
    description: Transformations are determined and executed independently for each row.
