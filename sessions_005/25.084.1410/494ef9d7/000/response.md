Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of pixels, with colors represented by integers 0-9. White (0) is the background color.
2.  **Color Presence:** Non-white pixels appear sparsely distributed across the grid.
3.  **Transformation Type:** The transformation involves changing the position of some colored pixels. Specifically, certain pixels move horizontally within their row to become adjacent to another specific colored pixel in the same row. The original position of the moved pixel becomes white (0).
4.  **Key Colors and Pairs:** The transformations seem to specifically involve two pairs of colors:
    *   Yellow (4) and Orange (7)
    *   Blue (1) and Azure (8)
5.  **Movement Condition:** Movement only occurs if exactly one pixel of each color in a pair exists within the same row, and all pixels *between* them are white (0).
6.  **Movement Rule:** Within a qualifying pair in a row:
    *   If the pair is Yellow (4) and Orange (7):
        *   If Yellow (4) is to the left of Orange (7), the Orange (7) pixel moves to the position immediately to the right of the Yellow (4) pixel.
        *   If Orange (7) is to the left of Yellow (4), the Yellow (4) pixel moves to the position immediately to the right of the Orange (7) pixel.
    *   If the pair is Blue (1) and Azure (8):
        *   If Blue (1) is to the left of Azure (8), the Azure (8) pixel moves to the position immediately to the right of the Blue (1) pixel.
        *   If Azure (8) is to the left of Blue (1), the Blue (1) pixel moves to the position immediately to the right of the Azure (8) pixel.
7.  **Pixel State Change:** The pixel that moves leaves its original location, which becomes white (0). The pixel that does *not* move (the anchor) remains in its original location.
8.  **Independence:** Each row is processed independently. If multiple pairs exist in different rows, they are all processed according to the rule. Pixels not involved in these specific pairs remain unchanged.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  For each row in the grid:
    a.  Find the locations (column indices) of all Yellow (4), Orange (7), Blue (1), and Azure (8) pixels within that row.
    b.  **Check for the Yellow-Orange pair:**
        i.  Count the number of Yellow (4) and Orange (7) pixels in the row.
        ii. If there is exactly one Yellow pixel (at `col_4`) and exactly one Orange pixel (at `col_7`):
            1.  Determine the leftmost column (`col_left`) and rightmost column (`col_right`).
            2.  Check if all pixels in the row between `col_left + 1` and `col_right - 1` (inclusive) are white (0).
            3.  If the space between is clear:
                *   If Yellow (4) is at `col_left` (i.e., `col_4 < col_7`), move the Orange pixel: change the pixel at (`row`, `col_left + 1`) in the output grid to Orange (7) and change the pixel at (`row`, `col_right`) to white (0).
                *   If Orange (7) is at `col_left` (i.e., `col_7 < col_4`), move the Yellow pixel: change the pixel at (`row`, `col_left + 1`) in the output grid to Yellow (4) and change the pixel at (`row`, `col_right`) to white (0).
    c.  **Check for the Blue-Azure pair:**
        i.  Count the number of Blue (1) and Azure (8) pixels in the row.
        ii. If there is exactly one Blue pixel (at `col_1`) and exactly one Azure pixel (at `col_8`):
            1.  Determine the leftmost column (`col_left`) and rightmost column (`col_right`).
            2.  Check if all pixels in the row between `col_left + 1` and `col_right - 1` (inclusive) are white (0).
            3.  If the space between is clear:
                *   If Blue (1) is at `col_left` (i.e., `col_1 < col_8`), move the Azure pixel: change the pixel at (`row`, `col_left + 1`) in the output grid to Azure (8) and change
