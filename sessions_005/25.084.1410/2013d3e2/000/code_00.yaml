task_type: extraction
input_grid_size: constant (10x10 in examples)
output_grid_size: constant (3x3)
transformation: extract a 3x3 subgrid from the input
elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: objects
    description: Contiguous or sparse patterns of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - bounding_box: The minimum rectangle containing all non-white pixels.
      - top_left_corner: The (row, column) coordinate of the top-left pixel of the bounding box.
  - type: conditional_marker
    color: blue (1)
    role: Influences the calculation of the extraction point.
rules:
  - description: Determine the top-left corner of the bounding box of all non-white pixels in the input grid. Let this be (R_bb, C_bb).
  - description: Check if the input grid contains any blue (1) pixels.
  - condition: If blue (1) pixels ARE present:
    action: Set the extraction top-left corner (R_extract, C_extract) to (R_bb, C_bb).
  - condition: If blue (1) pixels ARE NOT present:
    action: Set the extraction top-left corner (R_extract, C_extract) to (R_bb, C_bb - 2).
  - description: Extract the 3x3 subgrid from the input starting at (R_extract, C_extract). This subgrid is the output.
