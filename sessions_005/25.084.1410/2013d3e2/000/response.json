The output grids seem to be a direct sub-section (a crop) of the input grid.\n3.  **Color Presence:** The colors present in the output grid are also present in the corresponding input grid.\n4.  **Example 1 Specifics:** The input contains two isolated blue (1) pixels and a central 4x4 pattern. The output grid starts with a blue pixel at its top-left corner (0, 0).\n5.  **Example 2 Specifics:** The input contains a larger, somewhat symmetric pattern but no blue (1) pixels. The output grid starts with a white pixel (0) at its top-left corner (0, 0).\n6.  **Transformation Goal:** The task appears to be about identifying the correct 3x3 region within the input grid and extracting it to form the output grid.\n7.  **Key Challenge:** The main challenge is determining the coordinates of the top-left corner of the 3x3 region to be extracted.\n8.  **Potential Clue (Blue Pixels):** The presence or absence of blue (1) pixels in the input seems to correlate with how the extraction location is determined.\n9.  **Bounding Box:** The concept of a bounding box containing all non-white pixels seems relevant. The top-left corner of this bounding box appears to be a reference point.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
