Task: Extract a 3x3 subgrid based on content location.

Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: variable (height H, width W), up to 30x30
    - pixels: integers 0-9 representing colors (0 is white/background)
    - contains: multiple pixels forming background (white) and one or more foreground objects (non-white pixels)

Foreground_Content:
  Definition: All non-white pixels in the input grid.
  Properties:
    - forms one or more potentially disconnected shapes.
    - location and extent define a bounding box.

Bounding_Box:
  Definition: The smallest rectangle enclosing all non-white pixels.
  Properties:
    - top_left_corner: (min_row, min_col) where min_row is the smallest row index and min_col is the smallest column index containing a non-white pixel.

Output_Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: fixed 3x3
    - content: a subgrid extracted from the input grid.

Action:
  - Name: Extract Subgrid
  - Input: Input_Grid
  - Parameters:
      - source_grid: Input_Grid
      - top_row: min_row of the Bounding_Box
      - left_col: min_col of the Bounding_Box
      - height: 3
      - width: 3
  - Output: Output_Grid, which is the 3x3 subgrid from source_grid starting at (top_row, left_col).

Observation:
  - The presence or absence of specific colors (e.g., blue) within the Foreground_Content was initially considered relevant but proven incorrect by Example 2. The determining factor for the extraction location is solely the top-left corner of the overall bounding box of non-white pixels.
