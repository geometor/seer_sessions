Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The inputs are 10x10 grids, while the outputs are smaller 3x3 grids.
2.  **Content:** The input grids contain a background of white pixels (0) and distinct patterns or objects composed of other colors. The output grids seem to be a direct sub-section (a crop) of the input grid.
3.  **Color Presence:** The colors present in the output grid are also present in the corresponding input grid.
4.  **Example 1 Specifics:** The input contains two isolated blue (1) pixels and a central 4x4 pattern. The output grid starts with a blue pixel at its top-left corner (0, 0).
5.  **Example 2 Specifics:** The input contains a larger, somewhat symmetric pattern but no blue (1) pixels. The output grid starts with a white pixel (0) at its top-left corner (0, 0).
6.  **Transformation Goal:** The task appears to be about identifying the correct 3x3 region within the input grid and extracting it to form the output grid.
7.  **Key Challenge:** The main challenge is determining the coordinates of the top-left corner of the 3x3 region to be extracted.
8.  **Potential Clue (Blue Pixels):** The presence or absence of blue (1) pixels in the input seems to correlate with how the extraction location is determined.
9.  **Bounding Box:** The concept of a bounding box containing all non-white pixels seems relevant. The top-left corner of this bounding box appears to be a reference point.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: extraction
input_grid_size: constant (10x10 in examples)
output_grid_size: constant (3x3)
transformation: extract a 3x3 subgrid from the input
elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: objects
    description: Contiguous or sparse patterns of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - bounding_box: The minimum rectangle containing all non-white pixels.
      - top_left_corner: The (row, column) coordinate of the top-left pixel of the bounding box.
  - type: conditional_marker
    color: blue (1)
    role: Influences the calculation of the extraction point.
rules:
  - description: Determine the top-left corner of the bounding box of all non-white pixels in the input grid. Let this be (R_bb, C_bb).
  - description: Check if the input grid contains any blue (1) pixels.
  - condition: If blue (1) pixels ARE present:
    action: Set the extraction top-left corner (R_extract, C_extract) to (R_bb, C_bb).
  - condition: If blue (1) pixels ARE NOT present:
    action: Set the extraction top-left corner (R_extract, C_extract) to (R_bb, C_bb - 2).
  - description: Extract the 3x3 subgrid from the input starting at (R_extract, C_extract). This subgrid is the output.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid.
2.  Determine the minimum bounding box that encloses all these non-white pixels.
3.  Find the row (`R_bb`) and column (`C_bb`) coordinates of the top-left corner of this bounding box.
4.  Check if any pixel in the input grid has the color blue (1).
5.  **If** the input grid contains at least one blue pixel:
    *   The top-left corner for extraction (`R_extract`, `C_extract`) is (`R_bb`, `C_bb`).
6.  **Else** (if the input grid does *not* contain any blue pixels):
    *   The top-left corner for extraction (`R_extract`, `C_extract`) is (`R_bb`, `C_bb` - 2).
7.  Extract the 3x3 subgrid from the input grid starting at position (`R_extract`, `C_extract`).
8.  The extracted 3x3 subgrid is the output grid.
