Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid. Determine the minimum bounding 
box that encloses all these non-white pixels. Find the row (R_bb) and column 
(C_bb) coordinates of the top-left corner of this bounding box. Check if any 
pixel in the input grid has the color blue (1). If the input grid contains at 
least one blue pixel, the top-left corner for extraction (R_extract, C_extract) 
is (R_bb, C_bb). Otherwise (if the input grid does not contain any blue pixels), 
the top-left corner for extraction (R_extract, C_extract) is (R_bb, C_bb - 2). 
Extract the 3x3 subgrid from the input grid starting at position 
(R_extract, C_extract). This extracted 3x3 subgrid is the output grid.
