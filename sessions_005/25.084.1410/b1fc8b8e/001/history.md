Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Size:** All training examples take a 6x6 grid as input and produce a 5x5 grid as output.
2.  **Colors:** The grids primarily use white (0) and azure (8).
3.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain varying patterns of azure pixels scattered on a white background. The arrangement and density of azure pixels change between examples.
4.  **Output Structure:** The output grids exhibit a consistent underlying structure:
    *   They are always 5x5.
    *   The middle row (index 2) is always entirely white (0).
    *   The middle column (index 2) is always entirely white (0).
5.  **Output Variation:** Despite the common structure, there are two distinct output patterns observed:
    *   **Pattern A:** (Seen in train_1, train_2) The non-middle-row/column pixels are all azure (8).
        
```
        8 8 0 8 8
        8 8 0 8 8
        0 0 0 0 0
        8 8 0 8 8
        8 8 0 8 8
        ```

    *   **Pattern B:** (Seen in train_3, train_4, train_5) Same as Pattern A, but the four corner pixels (0,0), (0,4), (4,0), (4,4) are white (0). *Correction*: Looking closer at Pattern B examples (train_3, 4, 5), the changed pixels are (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3). Not exactly corners of the 5x5, but corners of the four 2x2 subgrids. Let's refine Pattern B:
        
```
        0 8 0 0 8  <- Changed: (0,0), (0,3)
        8 8 0 8 8
        0 0 0 0 0
        0 8 0 0 8  <- Changed: (3,0), (3,3)
        8 8 0 8 8
        ```

6.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation doesn't seem to involve direct pixel mapping, shape recognition, or object manipulation from the input. Instead, the choice between the two output patterns appears conditional based on a global property of the input grid.
7.  **Condition Discovery:** By analyzing the inputs that lead to Pattern A versus Pattern B, a correlation emerges with the number of azure (8) pixels located on the outer border (perimeter) of the 6x6 input grid.
    *   Inputs leading to Pattern A (train_1, train_2) have 7 and 6 azure border pixels, respectively.
    *   Inputs leading to Pattern B (train_3, train_4, train_5) all have 2 azure border pixels.
    *   Hypothesis: If the count of azure border pixels in the input is greater than 2, the output is Pattern A. Otherwise (count <= 2), the output is Pattern B. This holds for all training examples.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize a counter for azure border pixels to zero.
2.  Iterate through the cells on the perimeter of the input 6x6 grid (row 0, row 5, column 0, column 5).
3.  For each border cell, if its color is azure (8), increment the counter. Ensure corner cells are counted only once.
4.  Check the final count of azure border pixels.
5.  If the count is greater than 2:
    *   Create a 5x5 grid.
    *   Set the middle row (row 2) and middle column (column 2) to white (0).
    *   Set all other pixels to azure (8).
6.  If the count is 2 or less:
    *   Create a 5x5 grid.
    *   Set the middle row (row 2) and middle column (column 2) to white (0).
    *   Set all other pixels to azure (8), EXCEPT for the pixels at coordinates (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), which should be set to white (0).
7.  Return the generated 5x5 grid as the output.
