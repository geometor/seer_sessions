The arrangement and density of azure pixels change between examples.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output grids exhibit a consistent underlying structure:\n    *   They are always 5x5.\n    *   The middle row (index 2) is always entirely white (0).\n    *   The middle column (index 2) is always entirely white (0).\n5.  **Output Variation:** Despite the common structure, there are two distinct output patterns observed:\n    *   **Pattern A:** (Seen in train_1, train_2) The non-middle-row/column pixels are all azure (8).\n        "

Instead, the choice between the two output patterns appears conditional based on a global property of the input grid.\n7.  **Condition Discovery:** By analyzing the inputs that lead to Pattern A versus Pattern B, a correlation emerges with the number of azure (8) pixels located on the outer border (perimeter) of the 6x6 input grid.\n    *   Inputs leading to Pattern A (train_1, train_2) have 7 and 6 azure border pixels, respectively.\n    *   Inputs leading to Pattern B (train_3, train_4, train_5) all have 2 azure border pixels.\n    *   Hypothesis: If the count of azure border pixels in the input is greater than 2, the output is Pattern A. Otherwise (count <= 2), the output is Pattern B. This holds for all training examples.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
