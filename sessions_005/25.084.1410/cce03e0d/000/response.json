            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each task instance takes a small input grid (3x3 in all examples) and produces a larger output grid (9x9 in all examples).\n2.  **Size Transformation:** The output grid dimensions are exactly 3 times the input grid dimensions in both height and width.\n3.  **Content Relationship:** The output grid appears to be composed of multiple copies of the input grid placed within a larger frame, or a grid of \"slots\". The output grid can be conceptualized as a 3x3 grid of slots, where each slot has the same dimensions as the input grid (3x3).\n4.  **Placement Pattern:** The placement of the input grid copies within the output grid is not fixed. It varies between examples.\n    *   In `train_1`, copies are in the top-right and bottom-left slots.\n    *   In `train_2`, a copy is in the middle-left slot.\n    *   In `train_3`, copies are in the top-left, top-right, middle-center, bottom-left, and bottom-right slots.\n5.  **Background:** The areas in the output grid where no input grid copy is placed are filled with the background color `white` (0).\n6.  **Placement Trigger:** The key seems to be relating the *content* of the input grid to the *placement* of copies in the output grid. The input grid acts as a \"map\" or \"selector\" for the 3x3 output slots.\n7.  **Identifying the Rule:** By comparing the input pixel colors with the output slot locations, a pattern emerges:\n    *   If a pixel in the input grid at coordinates `(r, c)` is `red` (2), a copy of the *entire* input grid is placed in the corresponding slot `(r, c)` of the 3x3 output grid structure.\n    *   There's a special case observed in `train_3`: an additional copy is placed in the bottom-right slot `(2, 2)`. This occurs when the input grid's center pixel `(1, 1)` is `red` (2) *and* the input grid's bottom-right pixel `(2, 2)` is `white` (0). This condition is met only in `train_3`, explaining the extra copy there. In `train_1` and `train_2`, the center pixel is not `red`, so this special rule doesn't apply.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Create a new output grid `O` with height `3*H` and width `3*W`, initializing all its pixels to `white` (0).\n3.  Iterate through each row `r` from 0 to `H-1` and each column `c` from 0 to `W-1` of the input grid `I`.\n4.  Examine the color of the pixel `I[r, c]`.\n5.  If `I[r, c]` is `red` (2), then copy the entire input grid `I` into the output grid `O`, starting at the position `(r * H, c * W)`. This means for every `i` from 0 to `H-1` and `j` from 0 to `W-1`, set `O[r*H + i, c*W + j] = I[i, j]`.\n6.  After checking all pixels based on the primary rule (step 5), check the color of the center pixel of the input grid, `I[H // 2, W // 2]`.\n7.  If `I[H // 2, W // 2]` is `red` (2), then check the color of the bottom-right pixel of the input grid, `I[H - 1, W - 1]`.\n8.  If `I[H - 1, W - 1]` is `white` (0) (and the condition in step 7 was met), then copy the entire input grid `I` into the output grid `O`, starting at the position `((H - 1) * H, (W - 1) * W)`. This means for every `i` from 0 to `H-1` and `j` from 0 to `W-1`, set `O[(H-1)*H + i, (W-1)*W + j] = I[i, j]`. (Note: this copy might overwrite parts of previous copies if slots overlap, but given the non-overlapping slot structure, it effectively just places the copy).\n9.  Return the final output grid `O`."
