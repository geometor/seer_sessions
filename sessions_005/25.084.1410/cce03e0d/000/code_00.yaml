Input Grid:
  - property: dimensions
    value: H rows x W columns (e.g., 3x3 in examples)
  - property: content
    value: pixels with colors 0-9

Output Grid:
  - property: dimensions
    value: 3*H rows x 3*W columns (e.g., 9x9 in examples)
  - property: structure
    value: Can be viewed as a 3x3 grid of slots, each slot being HxW.
  - property: background_color
    value: white (0)
  - property: content
    value: composed of copies of the input grid placed in specific slots, based on the input grid's content.

Transformation Rule:
  - action: Create initial output grid (3H x 3W) filled with white (0).
  - condition: Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the input grid.
  - action_primary: If input_pixel[r, c] is red (2), copy the entire input grid to the output grid slot (r, c). (Slot (r,c) starts at output coordinates (r*H, c*W)).
  - condition_special: Check if the center input pixel input_pixel[H//2, W//2] is red (2).
  - action_special: If the center is red (2) AND the bottom-right input pixel input_pixel[H-1, W-1] is white (0), copy the entire input grid to the output grid slot (H-1, W-1).

Relationships:
  - The position (r, c) of a pixel in the input grid directly corresponds to the potential slot (r, c) in the conceptual 3x3 output structure.
  - The color red (2) in the input grid acts as the primary trigger for placing a copy.
  - The color white (0) at the bottom-right input position acts as a secondary trigger, conditional on the center input pixel being red (2).
