Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each task instance takes a small input grid (3x3 in all examples) and produces a larger output grid (9x9 in all examples).
2.  **Size Transformation:** The output grid dimensions are exactly 3 times the input grid dimensions in both height and width.
3.  **Content Relationship:** The output grid appears to be composed of multiple copies of the input grid placed within a larger frame, or a grid of "slots". The output grid can be conceptualized as a 3x3 grid of slots, where each slot has the same dimensions as the input grid (3x3).
4.  **Placement Pattern:** The placement of the input grid copies within the output grid is not fixed. It varies between examples.
    *   In `train_1`, copies are in the top-right and bottom-left slots.
    *   In `train_2`, a copy is in the middle-left slot.
    *   In `train_3`, copies are in the top-left, top-right, middle-center, bottom-left, and bottom-right slots.
5.  **Background:** The areas in the output grid where no input grid copy is placed are filled with the background color `white` (0).
6.  **Placement Trigger:** The key seems to be relating the *content* of the input grid to the *placement* of copies in the output grid. The input grid acts as a "map" or "selector" for the 3x3 output slots.
7.  **Identifying the Rule:** By comparing the input pixel colors with the output slot locations, a pattern emerges:
    *   If a pixel in the input grid at coordinates `(r, c)` is `red` (2), a copy of the *entire* input grid is placed in the corresponding slot `(r, c)` of the 3x3 output grid structure.
    *   There's a special case observed in `train_3`: an additional copy is placed in the bottom-right slot `(2, 2)`. This occurs when the input grid's center pixel `(1, 1)` is `red` (2) *and* the input grid's bottom-right pixel `(2, 2)` is `white` (0). This condition is met only in `train_3`, explaining the extra copy there. In `train_1` and `train_2`, the center pixel is not `red`, so this special rule doesn't apply.

## Facts


```yaml
Input Grid:
  - property: dimensions
    value: H rows x W columns (e.g., 3x3 in examples)
  - property: content
    value: pixels with colors 0-9

Output Grid:
  - property: dimensions
    value: 3*H rows x 3*W columns (e.g., 9x9 in examples)
  - property: structure
    value: Can be viewed as a 3x3 grid of slots, each slot being HxW.
  - property: background_color
    value: white (0)
  - property: content
    value: composed of copies of the input grid placed in specific slots, based on the input grid's content.

Transformation Rule:
  - action: Create initial output grid (3H x 3W) filled with white (0).
  - condition: Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the input grid.
  - action_primary: If input_pixel[r, c] is red (2), copy the entire input grid to the output grid slot (r, c). (Slot (r,c) starts at output coordinates (r*H, c*W)).
  - condition_special: Check if the center input pixel input_pixel[H//2, W//2] is red (2).
  - action_special: If the center is red (2) AND the bottom-right input pixel input_pixel[H-1, W-1] is white (0), copy the entire input grid to the output grid slot (H-1, W-1).

Relationships:
  - The position (r, c) of a pixel in the input grid directly corresponds to the potential slot (r, c) in the conceptual 3x3 output structure.
  - The color red (2) in the input grid acts as the primary trigger for placing a copy.
  - The color white (0) at the bottom-right input position acts as a secondary trigger, conditional on the center input pixel being red (2).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Define the input grid `I` with height `H` and width `W`.
2.  Create a new output grid `O` with height `3*H` and width `3*W`, initializing all its pixels to `white` (0).
3.  Iterate through each row `r` from 0 to `H-1` and each column `c` from 0 to `W-1` of the input grid `I`.
4.  Examine the color of the pixel `I[r, c]`.
5.  If `I[r, c]` is `red` (2), then copy the entire input grid `I` into the output grid `O`, starting at the position `(r * H, c * W)`. This means for every `i` from 0 to `H-1` and `j` from 0 to `W-1`, set `O[r*H + i, c*W + j] = I[i, j]`.
6.  After checking all pixels based on the primary rule (step 5), check the color of the center pixel of the input grid, `I[H // 2, W // 2]`.
7.  If `I[H // 2, W // 2]` is `red` (2), then check the color of the bottom-right pixel of the input grid, `I[H - 1, W - 1]`.
8.  If `I[H - 1, W - 1]` is `white` (0) (and the condition in step 7 was met), then copy the entire input grid `I` into the output grid `O`, starting at the position `((H - 1) * H, (W - 1) * W)`. This means for every `i` from 0 to `H-1` and `j` from 0 to `W-1`, set `O[(H-1)*H + i, (W-1)*W + j] = I[i, j]`. (Note: this copy might overwrite parts of previous copies if slots overlap, but given the non-overlapping slot structure, it effectively just places the copy).
9.  Return the final output grid `O`.
