            "text": "**Metrics Confirmation:**\nThe code execution confirms the hypothesis:\n*   The output grid is always 3 times the size (height and width) of the input grid.\n*   The locations where the input grid is copied into the expected output (`actual_copy_locations`) precisely match the locations derived by multiplying the row and column indices of the `red` pixels in the input by the input grid's height and width, respectively (`expected_copy_locations_from_red`).\n\nThis holds true for all three examples. The special rule implemented in the previous code was incorrect and caused the failure in Example 3.\n\n**YAML and Natural Language Program:**\nWill now create the YAML facts and the revised natural language program based on this simpler, consistent rule.## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempted to solve the task based on observations from the first example only. It correctly identified the scaling of the output grid (3x input dimensions) and the basic mechanism of copying the input grid into specific slots in the output. However, it derived a \"Special Placement Rule\" based on the center and bottom-right pixels of the input grid, which was an overgeneralization from Example 1. This special rule caused the code to incorrectly place an additional copy of the input grid in Example 3, leading to the failure.\n\nThe analysis of all three examples reveals a simpler, consistent rule: the input grid is copied into the output grid at locations determined *solely* by the positions of the `red` pixels in the input grid. The \"Special Placement Rule\" is unnecessary and incorrect.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the error is to remove the \"Special Placement Rule\" from the logic and rely only on the primary rule: locate `red` pixels in the input and use their coordinates to determine the placement slots in the output.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe following metrics were gathered using code execution:\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Input Shape: (3, 3)\n- Output Shape: (9, 9)\n- Red Pixel Coordinates in Input: `[[0, 2], [2, 0]]`\n- Expected Copy Locations in Output (Top-Left): `[(0, 6), (6, 0)]` (Calculated as `(row * H, col * W)`)\n- Match between Red Pixels and Copy Locations: Yes\n\n**Example 2:**\n- Input Shape: (3, 3)\n- Output Shape: (9, 9)\n- Red Pixel Coordinates in Input: `[[1, 0]]`\n- Expected Copy Locations in Output (Top-Left): `[(3, 0)]` (Calculated as `(row * H, col * W)`)\n- Match between Red Pixels and Copy Locations: Yes\n\n**Example 3:**\n- Input Shape: (3, 3)\n- Output Shape: (9, 9)\n- Red Pixel Coordinates in Input: `[[0, 0], [0, 2], [1, 1], [2, 0]]`\n- Expected Copy Locations in Output (Top-Left): `[(0, 0), (0, 6), (3, 3), (6, 0)]` (Calculated as `(row * H, col * W)`)\n- Match between Red Pixels and Copy Locations: Yes\n\n**Summary:** In all examples, the output grid dimensions are 3 times the input grid dimensions. The input grid (referred to as the 'pattern grid') is copied into the output grid. The top-left corner of each copied pattern grid corresponds to a position `(r * H, c * W)`, where `(r, c)` is the coordinate of a `red` pixel (color 2) in the input grid, and `H`, `W` are the height and width of the input grid.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
