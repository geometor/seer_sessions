task_description: "Generate an output grid by tiling copies of the input grid based on the locations of red pixels within the input grid."
grid_properties:
  - input_grid:
      alias: I
      attributes:
        height: H
        width: W
  - output_grid:
      alias: O
      attributes:
        height: 3 * H
        width: 3 * W
        background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - object: pattern_grid
    definition: The entire input grid I.
  - object: trigger_pixel
    definition: Any pixel in the input grid I with the color red (2).
    location: Coordinates (r, c) within I.
actions:
  - action: initialize_output
    description: Create the output grid O with dimensions 3*H by 3*W, filled with the background color (white).
  - action: locate_triggers
    description: Identify all trigger_pixels (red pixels) in the input grid I. Record their coordinates (r, c).
  - action: place_pattern
    description: For each identified trigger_pixel at coordinates (r, c) in I, copy the entire pattern_grid (input grid I) into the output grid O.
    details: The top-left corner of the copied pattern_grid should be placed at coordinates (r * H, c * W) in O.
relationships:
  - relationship: trigger_to_placement
    description: The location (r, c) of a red pixel in the input grid determines the placement location (r * H, c * W) for a copy of the input grid in the output grid.
