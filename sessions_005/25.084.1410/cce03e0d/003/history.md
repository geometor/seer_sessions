```python

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms an input grid based on the following rules:

    1. Define the input grid `I` with height `H` and width `W`.
    2. Create a new output grid `O` with height `3*H` and width `3*W`, initializing all its pixels to `white` (0).
    3. Iterate through each row `r` from 0 to `H-1` and each column `c` from 0 to `W-1` of the input grid `I`.
    4. Examine the color of the pixel `I[r, c]`.
    5. If `I[r, c]` is `red` (2), then copy the entire input grid `I` into the output grid `O`, starting at the position `(r * H, c * W)`. This means for every `i` from 0 to `H-1` and `j` from 0 to `W-1`, set `O[r*H + i, c*W + j] = I[i, j]`.
    6. After checking all pixels based on the primary rule (step 5), check the color of the center pixel of the input grid, `I[H // 2, W // 2]`.
    7. If `I[H // 2, W // 2]` is `red` (2), then check the color of the bottom-right pixel of the input grid, `I[H - 1, W - 1]`.
    8. If `I[H - 1, W - 1]` is `white` (0) (and the condition in step 7 was met), then copy the entire input grid `I` into the output grid `O`, starting at the position `((H - 1) * H, (W - 1) * W)`. This means for every `i` from 0 to `H-1` and `j` from 0 to `W-1`, set `O[(H-1)*H + i, (W-1)*W + j] = I[i, j]`.
    9. Return the final output grid `O`.

**Metrics Confirmation:**
The code execution confirms the hypothesis:
*   The output grid is always 3 times the size (height and width) of the input grid.
*   The locations where the input grid is copied into the expected output (`actual_copy_locations`) precisely match the locations derived by multiplying the row and column indices of the `red` pixels in the input by the input grid's height and width, respectively (`expected_copy_locations_from_red`).

This holds true for all three examples. The special rule implemented in the previous code was incorrect and caused the failure in Example 3.

**YAML and Natural Language Program:**
Will now create the YAML facts and the revised natural language program based on this simpler, consistent rule.## General Assessment

The previous code attempted to solve the task based on observations from the first example only. It correctly identified the scaling of the output grid (3x input dimensions) and the basic mechanism of copying the input grid into specific slots in the output. However, it derived a "Special Placement Rule" based on the center and bottom-right pixels of the input grid, which was an overgeneralization from Example 1. This special rule caused the code to incorrectly place an additional copy of the input grid in Example 3, leading to the failure.

The analysis of all three examples reveals a simpler, consistent rule: the input grid is copied into the output grid at locations determined *solely* by the positions of the `red` pixels in the input grid. The "Special Placement Rule" is unnecessary and incorrect.

The strategy for resolving the error is to remove the "Special Placement Rule" from the logic and rely only on the primary rule: locate `red` pixels in the input and use their coordinates to determine the placement slots in the output.

## Metrics

The following metrics were gathered using code execution:

**Example 1:**
- Input Shape: (3, 3)
- Output Shape: (9, 9)
- Red Pixel Coordinates in Input: `[[0, 2], [2, 0]]`
- Expected Copy Locations in Output (Top-Left): `[(0, 6), (6, 0)]` (Calculated as `(row * H, col * W)`)
- Match between Red Pixels and Copy Locations: Yes

**Example 2:**
- Input Shape: (3, 3)
- Output Shape: (9, 9)
- Red Pixel Coordinates in Input: `[[1, 0]]`
- Expected Copy Locations in Output (Top-Left): `[(3, 0)]` (Calculated as `(row * H, col * W)`)
- Match between Red Pixels and Copy Locations: Yes

**Example 3:**
- Input Shape: (3, 3)
- Output Shape: (9, 9)
- Red Pixel Coordinates in Input: `[[0, 0], [0, 2], [1, 1], [2, 0]]`
- Expected Copy Locations in Output (Top-Left): `[(0, 0), (0, 6), (3, 3), (6, 0)]` (Calculated as `(row * H, col * W)`)
- Match between Red Pixels and Copy Locations: Yes

**Summary:** In all examples, the output grid dimensions are 3 times the input grid dimensions. The input grid (referred to as the 'pattern grid') is copied into the output grid. The top-left corner of each copied pattern grid corresponds to a position `(r * H, c * W)`, where `(r, c)` is the coordinate of a `red` pixel (color 2) in the input grid, and `H`, `W` are the height and width of the input grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Define the input grid `I` with height `H` and width `W`.
2.  Create a new output grid `O` with height `3 * H` and width `3 * W`, initializing all its pixels to `white` (0).
3.  Iterate through each row `r` (from 0 to `H-1`) and each column `c` (from 0 to `W-1`) of the input grid `I`.
4.  If the pixel `I[r, c]` has the color `red` (2):
    a.  Calculate the target top-left coordinates in the output grid: `target_row = r * H`, `target_col = c * W`.
    b.  Copy the entire input grid `I` into the output grid `O`, starting at the position `(target_row, target_col)`. This means for every `i` from 0 to `H-1` and `j` from 0 to `W-1`, set `O[target_row + i, target_col + j] = I[i, j]`.
5.  Return the final output grid `O`.
