Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Size:** The output grid always has the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  **Color Palette:**
    *   Input uses white (0) as background and various other colors (green (3), yellow (4), orange (7)) to form shapes.
    *   Output replaces all white (0) pixels with either gray (5) or the color of an adjacent shape. The original non-white pixels mostly remain, but some change to gray (5).
3.  **Objects:** The primary objects in the input grids are contiguous horizontal segments (lines) of non-white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to operate row by row, focusing on these horizontal segments.
    *   **Left Expansion:** If a horizontal segment has a white pixel immediately to its left, that white pixel takes on the color of the segment in the output.
    *   **Right End Modification:** The rightmost pixel of a horizontal segment changes to gray (5) in the output *if* that pixel is at the right edge of the grid OR if the pixel immediately to its right in the input was white (0). Otherwise, the rightmost pixel retains its original color.
    *   **Background Fill:** All pixels that were originally white (0) and were not colored by the "Left Expansion" rule become gray (5) in the output.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - input_output_shape_match: true # Output grid dimensions are the same as input grid dimensions.
  color_map_used: true # Standard ARC color map applies.
  background_color: 0 # white is the background color in the input.
  output_background_color: 5 # gray seems to be the default fill color in the output.

objects:
  - type: segment
    description: Contiguous horizontal sequences of one or more non-white pixels within a single row.
    properties:
      - color: The uniform color of the pixels in the segment.
      - start_column: The column index of the leftmost pixel.
      - end_column: The column index of the rightmost pixel.
      - row: The row index where the segment exists.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Relationship between pixels (side-by-side horizontally).
    properties:
      - pixel_1: A pixel location (row, col).
      - pixel_2: A pixel location (row, col +/- 1).
      - direction: left or right.
  - type: boundary
    description: Relationship of a pixel or segment to the grid edges.
    properties:
      - edge: left, right, top, bottom.

actions:
  - action: identify_segments
    description: Find all horizontal non-white segments in each row of the input grid.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - list_of_segments (each with color, row, start_col, end_col)

  - action: modify_pixels
    description: Apply color changes based on segments and adjacency rules to create the output grid.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - list_of_segments
    outputs:
      - output_grid
    steps:
      - Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid.
      - For each segment:
        - If a white pixel exists to the left of the segment's start in the input, color that position in the output_grid with the segment's color.
        - If the segment's end is at the right grid edge OR if a white pixel exists to the right of the segment's end in the input, change the segment's end pixel in the output_grid to gray (5).
      - Iterate through the output_grid, changing any remaining white (0) pixels to gray (5).

transformation_rule:
  applies_to: Each row independently, based on horizontal segments.
  conditions:
    - Presence of horizontal non-white segments.
    - Adjacency of segments to white pixels (left and right).
    - Position of segments relative to the right grid boundary.
  effects:
    - White pixels to the left of segments adopt the segment's color.
    - The rightmost pixel of segments might change to gray based on right adjacency or boundary conditions.
    - All other white pixels become gray.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an output grid by copying the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3.  For the current row, identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels. Record each segment's color (C), start column (S), and end column (E).
4.  For each identified segment (C, S, E) in the current row:
    a.  Check the position `(row, S-1)`. If it is within the grid's left boundary (`S > 0`) and the pixel at `(row, S-1)` in the *input* grid is white (0), set the pixel at `(row, S-1)` in the *output* grid to color C.
    b.  Check if the segment ends at the right boundary (`E == grid_width - 1`) OR if the position `(row, E+1)` is within the grid's right boundary and the pixel at `(row, E+1)` in the *input* grid is white (0). If either of these conditions is true, set the pixel at `(row, E)` in the *output* grid to gray (5).
5.  After processing all segments for all rows, iterate through every pixel in the output grid. If any pixel still has the color white (0), change its color to gray (5).
6.  Return the modified output grid.
