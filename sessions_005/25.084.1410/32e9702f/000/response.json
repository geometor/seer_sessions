The original non-white pixels mostly remain, but some change to gray (5).\n3.  **Objects:** The primary objects in the input grids are contiguous horizontal segments (lines) of non-white pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to operate row by row, focusing on these horizontal segments.\n    *   **Left Expansion:** If a horizontal segment has a white pixel immediately to its left, that white pixel takes on the color of the segment in the output.\n    *   **Right End Modification:** The rightmost pixel of a horizontal segment changes to gray (5) in the output *if* that pixel is at the right edge of the grid OR if the pixel immediately to its right in the input was white (0). Otherwise, the rightmost pixel retains its original color.\n    *   **Background Fill:** All pixels that were originally white (0) and were not colored by the \"Left Expansion\" rule become gray (5) in the output.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
