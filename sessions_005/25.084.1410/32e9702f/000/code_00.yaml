task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - input_output_shape_match: true # Output grid dimensions are the same as input grid dimensions.
  color_map_used: true # Standard ARC color map applies.
  background_color: 0 # white is the background color in the input.
  output_background_color: 5 # gray seems to be the default fill color in the output.

objects:
  - type: segment
    description: Contiguous horizontal sequences of one or more non-white pixels within a single row.
    properties:
      - color: The uniform color of the pixels in the segment.
      - start_column: The column index of the leftmost pixel.
      - end_column: The column index of the rightmost pixel.
      - row: The row index where the segment exists.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Relationship between pixels (side-by-side horizontally).
    properties:
      - pixel_1: A pixel location (row, col).
      - pixel_2: A pixel location (row, col +/- 1).
      - direction: left or right.
  - type: boundary
    description: Relationship of a pixel or segment to the grid edges.
    properties:
      - edge: left, right, top, bottom.

actions:
  - action: identify_segments
    description: Find all horizontal non-white segments in each row of the input grid.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - list_of_segments (each with color, row, start_col, end_col)

  - action: modify_pixels
    description: Apply color changes based on segments and adjacency rules to create the output grid.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - list_of_segments
    outputs:
      - output_grid
    steps:
      - Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid.
      - For each segment:
        - If a white pixel exists to the left of the segment's start in the input, color that position in the output_grid with the segment's color.
        - If the segment's end is at the right grid edge OR if a white pixel exists to the right of the segment's end in the input, change the segment's end pixel in the output_grid to gray (5).
      - Iterate through the output_grid, changing any remaining white (0) pixels to gray (5).

transformation_rule:
  applies_to: Each row independently, based on horizontal segments.
  conditions:
    - Presence of horizontal non-white segments.
    - Adjacency of segments to white pixels (left and right).
    - Position of segments relative to the right grid boundary.
  effects:
    - White pixels to the left of segments adopt the segment's color.
    - The rightmost pixel of segments might change to gray based on right adjacency or boundary conditions.
    - All other white pixels become gray.
