Contains White (0) and Azure (8) pixels.\n        *   Right subgrid: Columns 5-8 (4 columns wide). Contains White (0) and Gray (5) pixels.\n    *   The Azure and Gray pixels appear in various patterns within their respective subgrids across the examples.\n\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:**\n    *   All output grids have dimensions 5x4.\n    *   They contain only White (0) and Red (2) pixels.\n    *   The dimensions (5x4) correspond to the number of rows in the input and the width of the left (or right) subgrid identified in the input.\n\n3.  **Relationship between Input and Output:**\n    *   The output grid seems to be generated by comparing the left subgrid (cols 0-3) and the right subgrid (cols 5-8) of the input, row by row and column by column.\n    *   The central yellow line (column 4) in the input is ignored in the output generation.\n    *   Comparing corresponding cells in the left and right subgrids:\n        *   If a cell in the left subgrid `(r, c)` and its corresponding cell in the right subgrid `(r, c+5)` are *both* non-white (Azure and Gray), the output cell `(r, c)` is White (0).\n        *   If a cell in the left subgrid `(r, c)` and its corresponding cell in the right subgrid `(r, c+5)` are *both* White (0), the output cell `(r, c)` is White (0).\n        *   If *exactly one* of the corresponding cells (`(r, c)` or `(r, c+5)`) is non-white (either Azure or Gray) and the other is White (0), the output cell `(r, c)` is Red (2).\n    *   This logic resembles a logical XOR operation based on the \"coloredness\" (non-white status) of the corresponding pixels in the left and right input subgrids.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
