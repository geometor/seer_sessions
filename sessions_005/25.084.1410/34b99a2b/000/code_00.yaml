Input Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: 5 rows, 9 columns
    - Colors Present: White (0), Azure (8), Yellow (4), Gray (5)
    - Structure:
      - Vertical Divider: A solid line of Yellow (4) in column index 4.
      - Left Section: Columns 0-3, contains White (0) and Azure (8).
      - Right Section: Columns 5-8, contains White (0) and Gray (5).
Output Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: 5 rows, 4 columns (Matches input rows and width of input sections)
    - Colors Present: White (0), Red (2)
Transformation:
  - Type: Pixel-wise comparison and generation
  - Comparison Rule: Compares pixels from the Left Section and Right Section of the input grid based on position.
  - Mapping: Input cell at (row `r`, column `c`) in the Left Section (where `0 <= c <= 3`) is compared with the input cell at (row `r`, column `c + 5`) in the Right Section.
  - Generation Logic:
    - For each position (`r`, `c`) in the output grid (where `0 <= r < 5`, `0 <= c < 4`):
      - Let `left_pixel` be the color at input `(r, c)`.
      - Let `right_pixel` be the color at input `(r, c + 5)`.
      - Condition 1: `left_pixel` is non-white (Azure 8) AND `right_pixel` is non-white (Gray 5). Result: Output pixel at (`r`, `c`) is White (0).
      - Condition 2: `left_pixel` is White (0) AND `right_pixel` is White (0). Result: Output pixel at (`r`, `c`) is White (0).
      - Condition 3: (`left_pixel` is non-white AND `right_pixel` is White) OR (`left_pixel` is White AND `right_pixel` is non-white). Result: Output pixel at (`r`, `c`) is Red (2).
  - Ignored Elements: The central Yellow (4) line in the input grid (column index 4) is not used in generating the output.
