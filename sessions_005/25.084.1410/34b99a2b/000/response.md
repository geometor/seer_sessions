Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:**
    *   All input grids have dimensions 5x9.
    *   They consistently feature a vertical line of Yellow (4) pixels in the 5th column (index 4).
    *   The grid is effectively divided by this yellow line into two subgrids:
        *   Left subgrid: Columns 0-3 (4 columns wide). Contains White (0) and Azure (8) pixels.
        *   Right subgrid: Columns 5-8 (4 columns wide). Contains White (0) and Gray (5) pixels.
    *   The Azure and Gray pixels appear in various patterns within their respective subgrids across the examples.

2.  **Output Grid Structure:**
    *   All output grids have dimensions 5x4.
    *   They contain only White (0) and Red (2) pixels.
    *   The dimensions (5x4) correspond to the number of rows in the input and the width of the left (or right) subgrid identified in the input.

3.  **Relationship between Input and Output:**
    *   The output grid seems to be generated by comparing the left subgrid (cols 0-3) and the right subgrid (cols 5-8) of the input, row by row and column by column.
    *   The central yellow line (column 4) in the input is ignored in the output generation.
    *   Comparing corresponding cells in the left and right subgrids:
        *   If a cell in the left subgrid `(r, c)` and its corresponding cell in the right subgrid `(r, c+5)` are *both* non-white (Azure and Gray), the output cell `(r, c)` is White (0).
        *   If a cell in the left subgrid `(r, c)` and its corresponding cell in the right subgrid `(r, c+5)` are *both* White (0), the output cell `(r, c)` is White (0).
        *   If *exactly one* of the corresponding cells (`(r, c)` or `(r, c+5)`) is non-white (either Azure or Gray) and the other is White (0), the output cell `(r, c)` is Red (2).
    *   This logic resembles a logical XOR operation based on the "coloredness" (non-white status) of the corresponding pixels in the left and right input subgrids.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: 5 rows, 9 columns
    - Colors Present: White (0), Azure (8), Yellow (4), Gray (5)
    - Structure:
      - Vertical Divider: A solid line of Yellow (4) in column index 4.
      - Left Section: Columns 0-3, contains White (0) and Azure (8).
      - Right Section: Columns 5-8, contains White (0) and Gray (5).
Output Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: 5 rows, 4 columns (Matches input rows and width of input sections)
    - Colors Present: White (0), Red (2)
Transformation:
  - Type: Pixel-wise comparison and generation
  - Comparison Rule: Compares pixels from the Left Section and Right Section of the input grid based on position.
  - Mapping: Input cell at (row `r`, column `c`) in the Left Section (where `0 <= c <= 3`) is compared with the input cell at (row `r`, column `c + 5`) in the Right Section.
  - Generation Logic:
    - For each position (`r`, `c`) in the output grid (where `0 <= r < 5`, `0 <= c < 4`):
      - Let `left_pixel` be the color at input `(r, c)`.
      - Let `right_pixel` be the color at input `(r, c + 5)`.
      - Condition 1: `left_pixel` is non-white (Azure 8) AND `right_pixel` is non-white (Gray 5). Result: Output pixel at (`r`, `c`) is White (0).
      - Condition 2: `left_pixel` is White (0) AND `right_pixel` is White (0). Result: Output pixel at (`r`, `c`) is White (0).
      - Condition 3: (`left_pixel` is non-white AND `right_pixel` is White) OR (`left_pixel` is White AND `right_pixel` is non-white). Result: Output pixel at (`r`, `c`) is Red (2).
  - Ignored Elements: The central Yellow (4) line in the input grid (column index 4) is not used in generating the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same number of rows as the input grid and a width of 4 columns, filled with White (0).
2.  Iterate through each row (`r`) from 0 to 4 and each column (`c`) from 0 to 3.
3.  For the current position (`r`, `c`):
    a.  Get the color of the pixel from the input grid at (`r`, `c`). Call this `left_color`.
    b.  Get the color of the pixel from the input grid at (`r`, `c + 5`). Call this `right_color`.
    c.  Check if `left_color` is White (0). Call this boolean `is_left_white`.
    d.  Check if `right_color` is White (0). Call this boolean `is_right_white`.
    e.  If `is_left_white` is *different* from `is_right_white` (i.e., one is white and the other is not), set the pixel in the output grid at (`r`, `c`) to Red (2).
    f.  Otherwise (if both are white or both are non-white), leave the pixel in the output grid at (`r`, `c`) as White (0).
4.  Return the completed output grid.
