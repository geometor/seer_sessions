The final output is formed by vertically stacking `Bottom` above `Top`.\n\nThis hypothesis consistently explains all three examples.\n\n*   **YAML Facts Preparation:**\n    *   Objects: Input grid, Output grid, First column, Intermediate grid (input minus first column), Top subgrid, Bottom subgrid.\n    *   Properties: Grid dimensions, Pixel colors, First column content (all magenta vs. contains other color), Index of non-magenta pixel (`r`), Split index (`s`).\n    *   Actions: Remove column, Check column content, Find index, Calculate split index, Split grid, Concatenate grids.\n\n*   **Natural Language Program Preparation:** Clearly describe the final hypothesis.## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code, which simply removed the first column, failed because the transformation rule is more complex and conditional. The first column acts as a control mechanism: its content dictates how the rest of the grid should be processed. Specifically, the position of a non-magenta pixel in the first column determines how the remaining grid is split and rearranged. The previous attempt only captured the transformation for a specific case (implicitly, the case derived from Example 1, although the analysis was slightly flawed as Example 1 also involves a rearrangement).\n\nThe strategy moving forward is to implement the conditional logic identified:\n1.  Check the first column for non-magenta pixels.\n2.  If found, determine the row index `r`.\n3.  Remove the first column.\n4.  Calculate the split point `s` based on `r` and the grid height.\n5.  Split the remaining grid at row `s`.\n6.  Reconstruct the output grid by stacking the bottom part above the top part.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the `tool_code` execution:\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | First Column           | First Col Unique Colors | Non-Magenta Index (r) | Non-Magenta Color | Calculated Split After Row (s) |\n| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :--------------------- | :---------------------- | :-------------------- | :---------------- | :----------------------------- |\n| 1       | (6, 7)      | (6, 6)       | `[2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]` | `[2, 6]` (Red, Magenta) | 0                     | 2 (Red)           | 5                              |\n| 2       | (6, 7)      | (6, 6)       | `[6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 6]` | `[2, 6]` (Red, Magenta) | 2                     | 2 (Red)           | 3                              |\n| 3       | (6, 7)      | (6, 6)       | `[6, 6, 6, 2, 6, 6]` | `[2, 6]` (Red, Magenta) | 3                     | 2 (Red)           | 2                              |\n\n*   **Observations:**\n    *   All inputs are 6x7, outputs are 6x6. The transformation consistently removes the first column and preserves the remaining dimensions.\n    *   The first column always contains magenta (6) and exactly one red (2) pixel in these examples.\n    *   The row index `r` of the red pixel varies.\n    *   The calculated split point `s = H - 1 - r` correctly corresponds to the observed rearrangement in all examples:\n        *   Ex 1: `r=0`, `s=5`. Split after row 5. Bottom part (rows 6+) is empty. Top part (rows 0-5). Output = stack(empty, rows 0-5) = rows 0-5. This matches the output, which is just the input minus the first column.\n        *   Ex 2: `r=2`, `s=3`. Split after row 3. Bottom part (rows 4-5). Top part (rows 0-3). Output = stack(rows 4-5, rows 0-3). This matches the expected output.\n        *   Ex 3: `r=3`, `s=2`. Split after row 2. Bottom part (rows 3-5). Top part (rows 0-2). Output = stack(rows 3-5, rows 0-2). This matches the expected output.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
