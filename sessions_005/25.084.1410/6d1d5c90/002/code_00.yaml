task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - input_output_shape_relation: Output grid height is the same as input grid height. Output grid width is one less than input grid width.
    - colors: Magenta (6) appears in the first column of all inputs. Red (2) appears once in the first column of all inputs. Other colors form the main content.

objects:
  - object: first_column
    description: The column at index 0 of the input grid.
    properties:
      - contains_non_magenta_pixel: Boolean indicating if any color other than magenta (6) is present.
      - non_magenta_pixel_index: The row index 'r' of the first non-magenta pixel found (if any). In the examples, this is always red (2).

  - object: main_grid
    description: The portion of the input grid excluding the first column. (Columns 1 to N-1).
    properties:
      - height: H (same as input grid height)
      - width: W (input grid width - 1)

  - object: top_subgrid
    description: The upper portion of the main_grid after splitting.
    properties:
      - rows: 0 to 's' (inclusive), where 's' is the calculated split index.

  - object: bottom_subgrid
    description: The lower portion of the main_grid after splitting.
    properties:
      - rows: 's'+1 to H-1 (inclusive), where 's' is the calculated split index and H is height.

actions:
  - action: identify_split_index
    description: >
      Find the row index 'r' of the non-magenta pixel in the first_column.
      Calculate the split row 's' using the formula s = H - 1 - r, where H is the grid height.
    inputs:
      - first_column
      - grid_height (H)
    outputs:
      - split_index (s)
      - non_magenta_index (r)

  - action: extract_main_grid
    description: Remove the first_column from the input grid.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - main_grid

  - action: split_grid
    description: Divide the main_grid horizontally into top_subgrid and bottom_subgrid based on the split_index 's'.
    inputs:
      - main_grid
      - split_index (s)
    outputs:
      - top_subgrid
      - bottom_subgrid

  - action: reconstruct_output
    description: Vertically stack the bottom_subgrid above the top_subgrid.
    inputs:
      - top_subgrid
      - bottom_subgrid
    outputs:
      - output_grid

transformation_rule:
  condition: A non-magenta pixel exists in the first_column.
  steps:
    - identify_split_index
    - extract_main_grid
    - split_grid (using identified split_index)
    - reconstruct_output
