In all provided examples, the input grid has a shape of 6 rows and 7 columns, while the output grid has a shape of 6 rows and 6 columns. Visually comparing the input and output grids reveals that the output grid is identical to the input grid, but with the first (leftmost) column removed. The colors present in the first column (red and magenta in these examples) are therefore absent in the output. The core transformation is a simple cropping operation, specifically removing the column at index 0.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
