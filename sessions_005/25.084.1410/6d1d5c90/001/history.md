*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid. In all provided examples, the input grid has a shape of 6 rows and 7 columns, while the output grid has a shape of 6 rows and 6 columns. Visually comparing the input and output grids reveals that the output grid is identical to the input grid, but with the first (leftmost) column removed. The colors present in the first column (red and magenta in these examples) are therefore absent in the output. The core transformation is a simple cropping operation, specifically removing the column at index 0.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    examples:
      - input_grid: A 2D array of integers (pixels) with dimensions 6x7.
        output_grid: A 2D array of integers (pixels) with dimensions 6x6.
        relationship: The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid.
        transformation: The first column (index 0) of the input grid is removed.
      - input_grid: A 2D array of integers (pixels) with dimensions 6x7.
        output_grid: A 2D array of integers (pixels) with dimensions 6x6.
        relationship: The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid.
        transformation: The first column (index 0) of the input grid is removed.
      - input_grid: A 2D array of integers (pixels) with dimensions 6x7.
        output_grid: A 2D array of integers (pixels) with dimensions 6x6.
        relationship: The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid.
        transformation: The first column (index 0) of the input grid is removed.
    general_rule:
      input_grid: A 2D array of integers.
      output_grid: A 2D array derived from the input.
      property: The output grid has the same number of rows as the input grid.
      property: The output grid has one fewer column than the input grid.
      action: Remove the first column (column at index 0) from the input grid to produce the output grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Given an input grid.
    2.  Create the output grid by taking all rows and all columns from the input grid *starting from the second column* (index 1) to the last column.
    3.  Return the resulting grid.
