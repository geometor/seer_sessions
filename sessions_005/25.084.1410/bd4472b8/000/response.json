            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consist of three main parts vertically:\n    *   A top section containing rows with various non-white colors.\n    *   A single row composed entirely of gray (5) pixels acting as a separator.\n    *   A bottom section composed entirely of white (0) pixels.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the top section and the gray separator row from the input. The bottom white section is replaced with rows filled with solid colors.\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation happens in the white rows below the gray separator.\n4.  **Pattern Source:** The sequence of colors used to fill the bottom rows is determined by the colors present in the row *immediately above* the gray separator row. Let's call this the \"pattern row\".\n5.  **Filling Mechanism:** Each white row in the input corresponds to a filled row in the output. The color used to fill a specific row is taken sequentially from the pattern row. The sequence repeats (wraps around) if there are more white rows than colors in the pattern row. The *entire* row is filled with the single selected color.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
