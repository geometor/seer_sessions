task_description: Fill white rows below a gray separator based on a repeating color pattern from the row above the separator.
elements:
  - type: grid_section
    name: header
    description: One or more rows at the top containing non-white pixels. Persists unchanged in the output.
  - type: grid_row
    name: separator_row
    description: A single row consisting entirely of gray (5) pixels. Located below the header. Persists unchanged in the output.
    properties:
      color: gray (5)
      uniform: true
  - type: grid_row
    name: pattern_row
    description: The single row located immediately above the separator_row.
    properties:
      colors: Sequence of non-white colors defining the fill pattern.
  - type: grid_section
    name: target_area
    description: The section of the input grid below the separator_row, consisting entirely of white (0) pixels.
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      uniform_rows: true
  - type: grid_section
    name: filled_area
    description: The section of the output grid corresponding to the target_area, filled with solid color rows.
    properties:
      rows: Each row is filled uniformly with a single color.

    relation: determines_fill_color
    subject: pattern_row

    details: Colors from pattern_row are used sequentially (modulo length of pattern) to determine the fill color for each row in filled_area.
actions:
  - name: identify_separator
    actor: system
    input: input_grid
    output: index of the first row containing only gray (5) pixels.
  - name: identify_pattern
    actor: system
    input: input_grid, separator_index
    output: sequence of colors from the row at separator_index - 1.
  - name: copy_header_and_separator
    actor: system
    input: input_grid, separator_index
    output: partial_output_grid (containing rows 0 to separator_index).
  - name: fill_target_area
    actor: system
    input: partial_output_grid, pattern_sequence, separator_index, input_grid_height
    output: completed_output_grid
    steps:
      - Iterate through row indices `r` from `separator_index + 1` to `input_grid_height - 1`.
      - Calculate relative row index `i = r - (separator_index + 1)`.
      - Calculate pattern color index `p_idx = i % len(pattern_sequence)`.
      - Get color `c = pattern_sequence[p_idx]`.
      - Fill row `r` of the output grid entirely with color `c`.
