            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids often contain distinct shapes or lines, typically near the bottom. A key feature across all examples is a horizontal segment located at or near the bottom row, which is composed of at least two different non-white colors.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the original input structures. Additional pixels are added in the rows *above* the key horizontal segment identified in the input.\n3.  **Color Interaction:** The color of the newly added pixels in the output is determined by the colors within the key horizontal segment in the input. Specifically, one color seems to act as the 'source' or 'central' color, and the other(s) act as 'flanking' or 'trigger' colors.\n4.  **Positional Relationship:** The horizontal positions (columns) of the new pixels in the output correspond directly to the columns of the 'flanking' color pixels in the key input segment.\n5.  **Vertical Placement:** The vertical position (row) of each new pixel seems determined by moving upwards from the corresponding 'flanking' pixel in the input segment. The new pixel is placed in the highest row within that column that contains a white pixel, such that all pixels between this new position and the original segment (exclusive of the segment row) are also white. This effectively places the new pixel just \"below\" any non-white obstacle above it in that column, or at the top row if the column is entirely white above the segment.\n6.  **Identifying Colors:**\n    *   The 'central' color (the one projected upwards) appears to be the color within the key horizontal segment that is *not* at the absolute horizontal ends of the non-white portion of the segment.\n    *   The 'flanking' color(s) are those at the horizontal ends, and potentially adjacent pixels of the same color extending inwards from the ends. Every pixel of the flanking color in that segment acts as a trigger point.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

This will be modified to become the output grid.\n2.  **Identify Key Segment:** Scan the input grid from bottom to top, row by row. Find the first (lowest) row (`r_seg`) that contains a horizontal sequence of connected non-white pixels composed of at least two different colors.\n3.  **Determine Colors:**\n    *   Examine the non-white pixels in the segment found in step 2.\n    *   Identify the color (`C1`) that appears between pixels of other colors. This is the 'central' color.\n    *   Identify the color (`C2`) that appears at the horizontal ends of the non-white sequence in the segment. These pixels, and any adjacent pixels of the same color `C2` within the segment, are the 'flanking' pixels.\n4.  **Process Flanking Pixels:** Iterate through each pixel `P_flank` located at `(r_seg, c_flank)` that has the flanking color `C2`.\n    *   **Trace Upwards:** Starting from the row directly above `P_flank` (`r = r_seg - 1`) and moving upwards towards row 0 (`r = 0`), examine the pixel at `(r, c_flank)`.\n    *   **Find Target Row:** Continue moving upwards as long as the pixel at `(r, c_flank)` is white (0). Stop when a non-white pixel is encountered or row 0 is reached. The last row `r_target` where the pixel `(r_target, c_flank)` was white is the target row for this column. If the pixel immediately above `P_flank` (at `r_seg - 1, c_flank`) is not white, or if `r_seg` is 0, there is no target row for this flanking pixel.\n    *   **Place Central Color:** If a target row `r_target` was found, change the color of the pixel at `(r_target, c_flank)` in the output grid to the central color `C1`.\n5.  **Final Output:** The modified grid after processing all flanking pixels is the final output."
