Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are consistently 9x10. They feature a background of white (0) pixels. Embedded within this background are six distinct 2x2 blocks of colored pixels. These blocks are arranged in a 2-row, 3-column formation relative to each other, separated by single rows/columns of white pixels. Specifically, the top-left corners of these blocks are at coordinates (1,1), (1,4), (1,7) for the top row, and (5,1), (5,4), (5,7) for the bottom row. The blocks themselves might contain pixels of different colors.
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are 4x5, also with a white background. They contain six colored pixels arranged in a 2-row, 3-column formation, mirroring the relative arrangement of the 2x2 blocks in the input. The output pixels are located at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) for the top row, and (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) for the bottom row.
3.  **Transformation:** The core task is to determine which single color from each 2x2 input block should be represented in the corresponding position in the output grid. Comparing the input blocks and output pixels across examples reveals a pattern based on color frequency within each 2x2 block. The color that appears most often within a 2x2 block is selected for the output. In cases where two colors appear twice (a tie), a secondary rule is needed. Observing the tie-breaker cases suggests that the color located in the bottom-right corner of the 2x2 block is chosen in case of a frequency tie.

**Facts:**

  - step: select_color
    description: >
      Determine the color with the highest frequency within the block.
      If there is a unique most frequent color, select it.
      If there is a tie in frequency (which occurs when two colors appear twice),
      select the color located at the bottom-right position of the 2x2 block
      (relative coordinates [1, 1] within the block).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize a 4x5 output grid filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Define the mapping between the top-left coordinates of the six 2x2 blocks in the input grid and the coordinates of the corresponding single pixels in the output grid:
    *   Input (1,1) maps to Output (1,1)
    *   Input (1,4) maps to Output (1,2)
    *   Input (1,7) maps to Output (1,3)
    *   Input (5,1) maps to Output (2,1)
    *   Input (5,4) maps to Output (2,2)
    *   Input (5,7) maps to Output (2,3)
3.  For each pair of corresponding input block coordinates `(r_in, c_in)` and output pixel coordinates `(r_out, c_out)`:
    a.  Extract the four pixel values from the 2x2 block starting at `(r_in, c_in)` in the input grid. Let these be `tl = input[r_in, c_in]`, `tr = input[r_in, c_in+1]`, `bl = input[r_in+1, c_in]`, `br = input[r_in+1, c_in+1]`.
    b.  Calculate the frequency of each non-white color within these four pixels.
    c.  Find the maximum frequency among the colors present.
    d.  Identify all colors that occur with this maximum frequency.
    e.  If only one color has the maximum frequency, select this color as the `result_color`.
    f.  If two colors tie for the maximum frequency (i.e., each appears twice), select the color at the bottom-right position of the block (`br = input[r_in+1, c_in+1]`) as the `result_color`.
    g.  Set the pixel at `(r_out, c_out)` in the output grid to the `result_color`.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
