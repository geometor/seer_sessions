            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are consistently 9x10. They feature a background of white (0) pixels. Embedded within this background are six distinct 2x2 blocks of colored pixels. These blocks are arranged in a 2-row, 3-column formation relative to each other, separated by single rows/columns of white pixels. Specifically, the top-left corners of these blocks are at coordinates (1,1), (1,4), (1,7) for the top row, and (5,1), (5,4), (5,7) for the bottom row. The blocks themselves might contain pixels of different colors.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are 4x5, also with a white background. They contain six colored pixels arranged in a 2-row, 3-column formation, mirroring the relative arrangement of the 2x2 blocks in the input. The output pixels are located at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) for the top row, and (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) for the bottom row.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core task is to determine which single color from each 2x2 input block should be represented in the corresponding position in the output grid. Comparing the input blocks and output pixels across examples reveals a pattern based on color frequency within each 2x2 block. The color that appears most often within a 2x2 block is selected for the output. In cases where two colors appear twice (a tie), a secondary rule is needed. Observing the tie-breaker cases suggests that the color located in the bottom-right corner of the 2x2 block is chosen in case of a frequency tie.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
