Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The examples involve input and output grids of varying widths but consistent heights within each example (mostly 3 or 4 rows, one example has 5).
2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved in the transformation are orange (7), red (2), and gray (5). The top row often contains a pattern of these colors mixed with orange, while the rows below are initially entirely orange in the input.
3.  **Transformation Area:** The transformation occurs in the rows *below* the first row (row 0). The first row of the input grid is always copied identically to the first row of the output grid.
4.  **Pattern Generation:** New non-orange pixels appear in the lower rows of the output grid. Their position and color seem dependent on the configuration of non-orange pixels in the row immediately above.
5.  **Local Rule:** The state of a cell `(r, c)` in the output grid (for `r > 0`) appears determined by the state of the two cells diagonally above it in the previous row (`r-1`): `(r-1, c-1)` and `(r-1, c+1)`.
6.  **Interaction Logic:**
    *   If either of the diagonal predecessors `(r-1, c-1)` or `(r-1, c+1)` is orange (7) or outside the grid boundaries, the cell `(r, c)` becomes orange (7).
    *   If both predecessors are non-orange and within bounds:
        *   If both are red (2), the cell `(r, c)` becomes gray (5).
        *   If both are gray (5), the cell `(r, c)` becomes red (2).
        *   If they are different non-orange colors, the cell `(r, c)` takes the color of the right predecessor `(r-1, c+1)`.
7.  **Simulation/Iteration:** This rule seems to be applied iteratively row by row, starting from row 1. The calculation for row `r` depends on the final calculated values of row `r-1`. This resembles a 1D cellular automaton rule applied vertically, where the state of the next row depends on the previous row.

**Facts**


```yaml
Transformation: Cellular Automaton Simulation

Grid_Properties:
  - Input and Output are 2D grids.
  - Height and Width can vary.
  - Pixels have integer values (colors) 0-9.
  - Row 0 of the input grid acts as the initial state or seed.
  - Rows below Row 0 in the input are typically filled with orange (7).

Objects:
  - Pixels: Characterized by color (value) and position (row, column).
  - Significant colors: Orange (7), Red (2), Gray (5).

Relationships:
  - Spatial: Pixels have neighbors (adjacent, diagonal).
  - Dependency: The color of a pixel at (r, c) for r > 0 depends on the colors of pixels at (r-1, c-1) and (r-1, c+1).

Actions/Rules:
  - Initialization: The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid OR the output grid is built row by row, starting with row 0 copied from the input.
  - Row 0 Handling: Row 0 of the output is identical to Row 0 of the input.
  - Pixel Update (for r > 0):
    - Get Left Diagonal Predecessor: L = color at (r-1, c-1). Handle boundary: If c-1 < 0, treat L as 7.
    - Get Right Diagonal Predecessor: R = color at (r-1, c+1). Handle boundary: If c+1 >= width, treat R as 7.
    - Apply Rule:
      - If L == 7 or R == 7: output[r, c] = 7
      - Else if L == 2 and R == 2: output[r, c] = 5
      - Else if L == 5 and R == 5: output[r, c] = 2
      - Else (L != R, neither is 7): output[r, c] = R
  - Iteration: The update rule is applied sequentially for each row r from 1 to height-1, using the results from row r-1 to calculate row r.

Result:
  - The final state of the output grid after applying the rules for all rows from 1 to height-1.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row `r` of the grid, starting from row `r = 1` up to the last row.
3.  For each column `c` in the current row `r`:
    a.  Determine the column indices for the left (`lc = c - 1`) and right (`rc = c + 1`) diagonal predecessors in the previous row (`r - 1`).
    b.  Get the color `L` of the left predecessor pixel at `(r-1, lc)`. If `lc` is less than 0 (out of bounds), treat `L` as orange (7).
    c.  Get the color `R` of the right predecessor pixel at `(r-1, rc)`. If `rc` is equal to or greater than the grid width (out of bounds), treat `R` as orange (7).
    d.  Apply the update rule to determine the new color for the output grid cell at `(r, c)`:
        i.  If either `L` or `R` is orange (7), set the output cell `(r, c)` to orange (7).
        ii. Else if `L` and `R` are both red (2), set the output cell `(r, c)` to gray (5).
        iii. Else if `L` and `R` are both gray (5), set the output cell `(r, c)` to red (2).
        iv. Else (if `L` and `R` are different non-orange colors), set the output cell `(r, c)` to the color `R`.
4.  After processing all cells in all rows from 1 to the end, the resulting grid is the final output. (Note: Row 0 remains unchanged from the input throughout this process).
