The top row often contains a pattern of these colors mixed with orange, while the rows below are initially entirely orange in the input.\n3.  **Transformation Area:** The transformation occurs in the rows *below* the first row (row 0). The first row of the input grid is always copied identically to the first row of the output grid.\n4.  **Pattern Generation:** New non-orange pixels appear in the lower rows of the output grid. Their position and color seem dependent on the configuration of non-orange pixels in the row immediately above.\n5.  **Local Rule:** The state of a cell `(r, c)` in the output grid (for `r > 0`) appears determined by the state of the two cells diagonally above it in the previous row (`r-1`): `(r-1, c-1)` and `(r-1, c+1)`.\n6.  **Interaction Logic:**\n    *   If either of the diagonal predecessors `(r-1, c-1)` or `(r-1, c+1)` is orange (7) or outside the grid boundaries, the cell `(r, c)` becomes orange (7).\n    *   If both predecessors are non-orange and within bounds:\n        *   If both are red (2), the cell `(r, c)` becomes gray (5).\n        *   If both are gray (5), the cell `(r, c)` becomes red (2).\n        *   If they are different non-orange colors, the cell `(r, c)` takes the color of the right predecessor `(r-1, c+1)`.\n7.  **Simulation/Iteration:** This rule seems to be applied iteratively row by row, starting from row 1. The calculation for row `r` depends on the final calculated values of row `r-1`. This resembles a 1D cellular automaton rule applied vertically, where the state of the next row depends on the previous row.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
