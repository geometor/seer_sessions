Transformation: Cellular Automaton Simulation

Grid_Properties:
  - Input and Output are 2D grids.
  - Height and Width can vary.
  - Pixels have integer values (colors) 0-9.
  - Row 0 of the input grid acts as the initial state or seed.
  - Rows below Row 0 in the input are typically filled with orange (7).

Objects:
  - Pixels: Characterized by color (value) and position (row, column).
  - Significant colors: Orange (7), Red (2), Gray (5).

Relationships:
  - Spatial: Pixels have neighbors (adjacent, diagonal).
  - Dependency: The color of a pixel at (r, c) for r > 0 depends on the colors of pixels at (r-1, c-1) and (r-1, c+1).

Actions/Rules:
  - Initialization: The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid OR the output grid is built row by row, starting with row 0 copied from the input.
  - Row 0 Handling: Row 0 of the output is identical to Row 0 of the input.
  - Pixel Update (for r > 0):
    - Get Left Diagonal Predecessor: L = color at (r-1, c-1). Handle boundary: If c-1 < 0, treat L as 7.
    - Get Right Diagonal Predecessor: R = color at (r-1, c+1). Handle boundary: If c+1 >= width, treat R as 7.
    - Apply Rule:
      - If L == 7 or R == 7: output[r, c] = 7
      - Else if L == 2 and R == 2: output[r, c] = 5
      - Else if L == 5 and R == 5: output[r, c] = 2
      - Else (L != R, neither is 7): output[r, c] = R
  - Iteration: The update rule is applied sequentially for each row r from 1 to height-1, using the results from row r-1 to calculate row r.

Result:
  - The final state of the output grid after applying the rules for all rows from 1 to height-1.
