GridProperties:
  - BackgroundColor: white (0)
  - ObjectColor: red (2)
  - GridWidth: Relevant for symmetry calculation (e.g., 6 in examples).

Objects:
  - Type: Pixel
  - Color: red (2)
  - Arrangement: Crucial property, specifically their column indices within rows.

Relationships:
  - HorizontalSymmetry: A red pixel at (r, c) may have a corresponding red pixel at (r, width-1-c).
  - EdgePlacement: Red pixels may be located at column 0 or column (width-1).
  - HorizontalAdjacency: Two red pixels at (r, c) and (r, c+1). Specifically relevant for symmetric pairs where c+1 = width-1-c.

Actions:
  - CheckCondition: Verify if all red pixels across all rows satisfy symmetry (edge or paired) AND that no symmetric pair is horizontally adjacent.
  - FillSegment: If the condition is met, fill horizontal segments between the minimum and maximum column index of red pixels in specific rows with red (2).
  - FillRow: A special case of FillSegment where the entire row is filled if specific sub-conditions are met (all red pixels were initially only at edges).
  - NoChange: If the initial condition is not met, the grid is outputted as is.

Conditions:
  - GlobalSymmetryCheck: Does every row satisfy the symmetry/edge placement rule?
  - AdjacencyCheck: Does any row contain a horizontally adjacent symmetric pair?
  - TransformationTrigger: GlobalSymmetryCheck is TRUE and AdjacencyCheck is FALSE.
  - FillTypeCondition: Based on whether *all* red pixels in the input grid were exclusively at the edges (cols 0 and width-1) or if some were placed symmetrically inwards.
