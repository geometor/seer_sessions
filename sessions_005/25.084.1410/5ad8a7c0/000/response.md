Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Colors:** The grids primarily use white (0) as the background and red (2) as the foreground or object color.
2.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain scattered red pixels.
3.  **Output Structure:** The output grids sometimes match the input exactly, and other times show horizontal lines or segments filled with red.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to be conditional. It involves checking the arrangement of red pixels within each row and across the grid. If certain conditions regarding horizontal symmetry and spacing are met, horizontal segments between the leftmost and rightmost red pixels in some rows are filled with red. Otherwise, the grid remains unchanged.
5.  **Symmetry:** Horizontal symmetry seems crucial. Red pixels often appear at the left/right edges (column 0 and `width-1`) or in pairs reflected across the vertical centerline of the grid (column `c` and column `width-1-c`).
6.  **Adjacency:** In cases where the transformation *doesn't* happen despite apparent symmetry (train_2, train_4), there are horizontally adjacent symmetric pairs of red pixels (e.g., columns 2 and 3 in a width-6 grid).
7.  **Conditional Filling:**
    *   If *all* red pixels in the input are perfectly symmetric *and* no symmetric pair is horizontally adjacent, a transformation occurs.
    *   If the transformation occurs *and* all red pixels were originally *only* at the absolute horizontal edges (columns 0 and `width-1`), the rows containing those edge pixels are filled entirely with red (train_1).
    *   If the transformation occurs *and* some red pixels were symmetrically placed *inward* from the edges, then only those rows with inward symmetric pairs have the space between those pairs filled with red. Rows with only edge pixels remain unchanged in this case (train_3, train_5).
    *   If the initial symmetry/non-adjacency condition is not met anywhere in the grid, the output is identical to the input (train_2, train_4).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
GridProperties:
  - BackgroundColor: white (0)
  - ObjectColor: red (2)
  - GridWidth: Relevant for symmetry calculation (e.g., 6 in examples).

Objects:
  - Type: Pixel
  - Color: red (2)
  - Arrangement: Crucial property, specifically their column indices within rows.

Relationships:
  - HorizontalSymmetry: A red pixel at (r, c) may have a corresponding red pixel at (r, width-1-c).
  - EdgePlacement: Red pixels may be located at column 0 or column (width-1).
  - HorizontalAdjacency: Two red pixels at (r, c) and (r, c+1). Specifically relevant for symmetric pairs where c+1 = width-1-c.

Actions:
  - CheckCondition: Verify if all red pixels across all rows satisfy symmetry (edge or paired) AND that no symmetric pair is horizontally adjacent.
  - FillSegment: If the condition is met, fill horizontal segments between the minimum and maximum column index of red pixels in specific rows with red (2).
  - FillRow: A special case of FillSegment where the entire row is filled if specific sub-conditions are met (all red pixels were initially only at edges).
  - NoChange: If the initial condition is not met, the grid is outputted as is.

Conditions:
  - GlobalSymmetryCheck: Does every row satisfy the symmetry/edge placement rule?
  - AdjacencyCheck: Does any row contain a horizontally adjacent symmetric pair?
  - TransformationTrigger: GlobalSymmetryCheck is TRUE and AdjacencyCheck is FALSE.
  - FillTypeCondition: Based on whether *all* red pixels in the input grid were exclusively at the edges (cols 0 and width-1) or if some were placed symmetrically inwards.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Define `width` as the number of columns in the input grid.
2.  Initialize a `condition_met` flag to TRUE.
3.  Iterate through each row `r` of the input grid:
    a.  Find all column indices `c` where the pixel is red (2).
    b.  If the row contains red pixels:
        i.  For each red pixel at column `c`:
            1.  Check if it's an edge pixel (`c == 0` or `c == width-1`).
            2.  If it's not an edge pixel, check if there is a corresponding symmetric red pixel at column `width-1-c` in the *same row*.
            3.  If a pixel is not an edge pixel and does not have a symmetric partner in its row, set `condition_met` to FALSE and break the checks for this row.
            4.  If a pixel `c` and its symmetric partner `width-1-c` form an adjacent pair (i.e., `c + 1 == width-1-c`), set `condition_met` to FALSE and break the checks for this row.
    c.  If `condition_met` becomes FALSE during the row check, stop checking further rows.
4.  If `condition_met` is FALSE after checking all rows, return the original input grid.
5.  If `condition_met` is TRUE:
    a.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    b.  Determine if *all* red pixels in the *entire original input grid* are located *only* at the edges (column 0 or `width-1`). Let this be `all_edges_only`.
    c.  Iterate through each row `r` of the input grid:
        i.  Find the minimum column index (`min_col`) and maximum column index (`max_col`) of red pixels in that row. Skip if the row has no red pixels.
        ii. If `all_edges_only` is TRUE: Fill the entire row `r` from column 0 to `width-1` in the output grid with red (2).
        iii. If `all_edges_only` is FALSE: Check if the red pixels in this specific row `r` are *not* solely at the edges (i.e., `min_col != 0` or `max_col != width-1`). If they are not solely at the edges, fill the segment of row `r` from `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive) in the output grid with red (2). (Rows with only edge pixels remain unchanged in this case).
    d.  Return the modified output grid.
