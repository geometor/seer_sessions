Identify all red pixels in the grid.\n    b.  For every red pixel at position (row, col), check the following:\n        i.  If the pixel is *not* on the left edge (col 0) or right edge (col width-1), verify that its symmetric counterpart at (row, width-1-col) is also a red pixel. If not, the condition fails.\n        ii. Check if any pair of symmetric red pixels are horizontally adjacent (i.e., col + 1 == width - 1 - col). If such an adjacent symmetric pair exists, the condition fails.\n    c.  If any check in step 1.b fails for any red pixel, the transformation is aborted, and the original input grid is returned.\n    d.  Simultaneously, track if *all* red pixels across the entire grid are located *only* at the edges (col 0 or col width-1).\n\n2.  **Transformation (if Condition Met):**\n    a.  If the condition from step 1 holds true for all red pixels:\n    b.  If *all* red pixels in the original input were located *only* at the edges (as determined in step 1.d):\n        i. For each row containing red pixels, fill the *entire* row with red (2) in the output grid.\n    c.  If *some* red pixels were located *inward* from the edges:\n        i. For each row `r` containing red pixels:\n           - Find the minimum column index (`min_col`) and maximum column index (`max_col`) of red pixels *in that specific row*.\n           - If this row `r` contains any non-edge red pixels (i.e., `min_col != 0` or `max_col != width-1`), fill the segment of that row from `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive) with red (2) in the output grid.\n           - Rows containing only edge red pixels remain unchanged in this case.\n    d.
