The outputs are smaller rectangular grids, also containing colors found in the input (specifically blue-1, red-2, azure-8). White (0) pixels are never present in the output.\n2.  **Extraction:** The output grid seems to be a direct copy of a rectangular sub-region from the input grid.\n3.  **Content:** The extracted sub-regions in all examples consist of contiguous blocks of non-white pixels. White pixels act as separators between these blocks.\n4.  **Multiple Blocks:** The input grids contain multiple distinct blocks (connected components) of non-white pixels.\n5.  **Selection Criteria:** The core task is to identify which of these non-white blocks should be extracted.\n    *   Comparing the blocks in each example, the selected block consistently contains the highest count of red (2) pixels compared to the other blocks in the same input grid.\n    *   Example 1: The bottom-left block (output) has 4 red pixels, while the top-left has 1, and the middle-right has 3.\n    *   Example 2: The top-right block (output) has 3 red pixels, while the bottom-middle block has 2.\n    *   Example 3: The top-left block (output) has 3 red pixels, while the middle-right block has 1.\n6.  **Output Definition:** The output grid is precisely the selected block, maintaining its original dimensions and pixel values.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
