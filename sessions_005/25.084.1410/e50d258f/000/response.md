Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The inputs are 10x10 grids containing various colors (white-0, blue-1, red-2, azure-8). The outputs are smaller rectangular grids, also containing colors found in the input (specifically blue-1, red-2, azure-8). White (0) pixels are never present in the output.
2.  **Extraction:** The output grid seems to be a direct copy of a rectangular sub-region from the input grid.
3.  **Content:** The extracted sub-regions in all examples consist of contiguous blocks of non-white pixels. White pixels act as separators between these blocks.
4.  **Multiple Blocks:** The input grids contain multiple distinct blocks (connected components) of non-white pixels.
5.  **Selection Criteria:** The core task is to identify which of these non-white blocks should be extracted.
    *   Comparing the blocks in each example, the selected block consistently contains the highest count of red (2) pixels compared to the other blocks in the same input grid.
    *   Example 1: The bottom-left block (output) has 4 red pixels, while the top-left has 1, and the middle-right has 3.
    *   Example 2: The top-right block (output) has 3 red pixels, while the bottom-middle block has 2.
    *   Example 3: The top-left block (output) has 3 red pixels, while the middle-right block has 1.
6.  **Output Definition:** The output grid is precisely the selected block, maintaining its original dimensions and pixel values.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9.
    properties:
      - height
      - width
      - pixels (cells with color values)
  - element: background_pixel
    value: 0 (white)
    role: Separates objects/blocks. Never appears in the output.
  - element: foreground_pixels
    values: [1, 2, 8] (blue, red, azure in these examples)
    role: Form contiguous blocks.
  - element: block
    description: A contiguous region (connected component) of foreground pixels within the input grid. Adjacency is typically 4-way (up, down, left, right).
    properties:
      - pixels (list of coordinates and colors)
      - bounding_box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)
      - color_counts (e.g., count of red pixels, count of blue pixels)
  - element: target_color
    value: 2 (red)
    role: Used as the primary criterion for selecting the output block.

actions:
  - action: identify_blocks
    description: Find all distinct contiguous blocks of foreground pixels in the input grid.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - list_of_blocks
  - action: analyze_blocks
    description: For each identified block, count the occurrences of the target color (red).
    inputs:
      - list_of_blocks
      - target_color
    outputs:
      - list_of_blocks_with_counts
  - action: select_block
    description: Choose the block with the maximum count of the target color. (Assume no ties or a default tie-breaking rule like top-leftmost if needed, though not observed in examples).
    inputs:
      - list_of_blocks_with_counts
    outputs:
      - selected_block
  - action: extract_subgrid
    description: Create the output grid by copying the pixels within the bounding box of the selected block from the input grid.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - selected_block
    outputs:
      - output_grid

relationships:
  - The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid.
  - The output grid corresponds exactly to one specific block of foreground pixels from the input.
  - The selection of the specific block is based on maximizing the count of red (2) pixels within the block.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all separate contiguous regions (blocks) within the input grid that consist entirely of non-white (color 0) pixels. Consider pixels connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally) as part of the same block.
2.  For each identified block, count how many pixels within that block have the color red (color 2).
3.  Determine which block contains the highest count of red pixels.
4.  Extract the rectangular subgrid from the input grid that exactly encompasses this selected block (i.e., the bounding box of the selected block). This extracted subgrid is the output.
