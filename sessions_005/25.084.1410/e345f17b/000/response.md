Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Each example consists of one input grid and one output grid.
2.  **Dimensions:** All input grids are 4 rows by 8 columns. All output grids are 4 rows by 4 columns. The output grid has the same height but half the width of the input grid.
3.  **Colors:**
    *   Input grids contain white (0), magenta (6), and gray (5) pixels.
    *   Output grids contain white (0) and yellow (4) pixels.
4.  **Structure:** The input grid appears to be composed of two distinct 4x4 sections placed side-by-side.
    *   The left 4x4 section (columns 0-3) primarily uses magenta (6) and white (0).
    *   The right 4x4 section (columns 4-7) primarily uses gray (5) and white (0).
5.  **Transformation:** The output grid seems to result from a pixel-wise comparison between the left and right halves of the input grid. For each position (row `r`, column `c`) in the 4x4 output grid, the corresponding pixel in the left input half (`L(r, c)`) and the right input half (`R(r, c)`) are compared.
6.  **Rule Discovery:** By comparing the input halves and the output across all examples, a consistent pattern emerges:
    *   If the pixel value at `L(r, c)` is the *same* as the pixel value at `R(r, c)`, the output pixel `O(r, c)` is yellow (4).
    *   If the pixel value at `L(r, c)` is *different* from the pixel value at `R(r, c)`, the output pixel `O(r, c)` is white (0). This holds true regardless of whether the matching pixels are white, magenta, or gray (though in the examples provided, only white-white matches occur leading to yellow).
