            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Each example consists of one input grid and one output grid.\n2.  **Dimensions:** All input grids are 4 rows by 8 columns. All output grids are 4 rows by 4 columns. The output grid has the same height but half the width of the input grid.\n3.  **Colors:**\n    *   Input grids contain white (0), magenta (6), and gray (5) pixels.\n    *   Output grids contain white (0) and yellow (4) pixels.\n4.  **Structure:** The input grid appears to be composed of two distinct 4x4 sections placed side-by-side.\n    *   The left 4x4 section (columns 0-3) primarily uses magenta (6) and white (0).\n    *   The right 4x4 section (columns 4-7) primarily uses gray (5) and white (0).\n5.  **Transformation:** The output grid seems to result from a pixel-wise comparison between the left and right halves of the input grid. For each position (row `r`, column `c`) in the 4x4 output grid, the corresponding pixel in the left input half (`L(r, c)`) and the right input half (`R(r, c)`) are compared.\n6.  **Rule Discovery:** By comparing the input halves and the output across all examples, a consistent pattern emerges:\n    *   If the pixel value at `L(r, c)` is the *same* as the pixel value at `R(r, c)`, the output pixel `O(r, c)` is yellow (4).\n    *   If the pixel value at `L(r, c)` is *different* from the pixel value at `R(r, c)`, the output pixel `O(r, c)` is white (0). This holds true regardless of whether the matching pixels are white, magenta, or gray (though in the examples provided, only white-white matches occur leading to yellow)."
