It is always located adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to at least one pixel of the primary color object.\n4.  **Primary Color Object:** There might be multiple distinct objects of the primary color in the input grid. The gray pixel identifies *which* specific object is relevant.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves isolating the primary color object touched by the gray pixel.\n6.  **Output Content:** The output grid represents the shape of the selected primary color object. It's extracted by finding the bounding box of the selected object and then creating a grid of that size, placing the primary color pixels relative to the top-left corner of the bounding box, and filling the rest with white (0).\n7.  **Output Size:** In all provided examples, the bounding box of the selected object, and therefore the output grid, is 3x3.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
