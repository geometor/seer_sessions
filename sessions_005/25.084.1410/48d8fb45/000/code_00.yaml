task_type: object_selection_and_extraction

input_grid:
  size: 10x10
  background_color: white (0)
  elements:
    - type: scattered_pixels
      color: gray (5)
      quantity: 1
      role: selector
    - type: objects
      color: variable (e.g., yellow, blue, red) - referred to as 'primary_color'
      quantity: multiple possible
      properties:
        - composed of contiguous pixels of the primary_color
        - at least one object is adjacent (including diagonals) to the gray pixel

output_grid:
  size: 3x3 (in examples, generally matches the bounding box size of the selected object)
  background_color: white (0)
  content: shape of the selected primary_color object

relationships:
  - the gray pixel selects one specific primary_color object through adjacency.
  - the output grid's content is derived solely from the selected primary_color object.
  - the output grid represents the relative shape of the selected object within its bounding box.

actions:
  - identify: locate the single gray pixel.
  - identify: determine the primary_color (non-white, non-gray).
  - find: identify the primary_color object adjacent to the gray pixel.
  - calculate: determine the bounding box of the selected object.
  - extract: create a new grid based on the bounding box dimensions.
  - map: transfer the pixels of the selected object to the new grid, relative to the bounding box's top-left corner, maintaining the primary_color.
  - fill: set all other pixels in the new grid to white (0).
