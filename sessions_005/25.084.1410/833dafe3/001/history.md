*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid that is twice the size in both height and width. The output grid appears to be constructed by arranging the original input grid and several reflected/rotated versions of it into four quadrants. Specifically, the output seems to follow a pattern where the original input is in the bottom-right, its horizontal reflection is in the bottom-left, its vertical reflection is in the top-right, and its 180-degree rotation (or combination of horizontal and vertical reflection) is in the top-left. This pattern holds true for both provided examples, suggesting a consistent geometric transformation rule.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: geometric_transformation
    transformation: tiling_with_reflections
    input_grid:
      description: A 2D grid of pixels with varying colors.
      properties:
        height: H
        width: W
    output_grid:
      description: A 2D grid of pixels, derived from the input grid.
      properties:
        height: 2 * H
        width: 2 * W
        structure: Composed of four HxW quadrants.
    quadrants:
      - position: top-left (rows 0..H-1, cols 0..W-1)
        content: 180-degree rotation of the input grid.
        derivation: Apply horizontal reflection then vertical reflection (or vice-versa) to the input grid.
      - position: top-right (rows 0..H-1, cols W..2W-1)
        content: Vertical reflection of the input grid.
        derivation: Reverse the order of rows of the input grid.
      - position: bottom-left (rows H..2H-1, cols 0..W-1)
        content: Horizontal reflection of the input grid.
        derivation: Reverse the order of columns of the input grid.
      - position: bottom-right (rows H..2H-1, cols W..2W-1)
        content: Original input grid.
        derivation: Direct copy of the input grid.
    relationships:
      - Output dimensions are double the input dimensions.
      - Output content is entirely determined by the input grid and its geometric transformations (reflections, rotation).
      - The transformation applies uniformly to all pixels based on their position.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept the input grid. Let its dimensions be H rows and W columns.
    2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions 2H rows and 2W columns, initially empty.
    3.  Generate the horizontal reflection of the input grid by reversing the order of its columns.
    4.  Generate the vertical reflection of the input grid by reversing the order of its rows.
    5.  Generate the 180-degree rotation of the input grid by applying both a horizontal and a vertical reflection to the input grid (the order does not matter).
    6.  Copy the original input grid into the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid (rows H to 2H-1, columns W to 2W-1).
    7.  Copy the horizontally reflected grid into the bottom-left quadrant of the output grid (rows H to 2H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
    8.  Copy the vertically reflected grid into the top-right quadrant of the output grid (rows 0 to H-1, columns W to 2W-1).
    9.  Copy the 180-degree rotated grid into the top-left quadrant of the output grid (rows 0 to H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
    10. Return the completed output grid.
