The output grid appears to be constructed by arranging the original input grid and several reflected/rotated versions of it into four quadrants. Specifically, the output seems to follow a pattern where the original input is in the bottom-right, its horizontal reflection is in the bottom-left, its vertical reflection is in the top-right, and its 180-degree rotation (or combination of horizontal and vertical reflection) is in the top-left. This pattern holds true for both provided examples, suggesting a consistent geometric transformation rule.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
