task_description: Extract the largest object based on pixel count and crop the output to its bounding box.

definitions:
  - object: A contiguous group of pixels sharing the same non-white color. Connectivity is typically adjacent (up, down, left, right).
  - background: Pixels with color 0 (white).
  - pixel_count: The total number of pixels belonging to an object.
  - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of an object.

input_features:
  - multiple_objects: Each input grid contains two or more distinct objects.
  - background_present: All input grids have a background color (0).
  - object_colors: Objects are composed of single, non-white colors (1-9).

output_features:
  - single_object: Each output grid contains exactly one object pattern.
  - cropped: The output grid dimensions match the bounding box of the selected object.
  - background_preservation: Background pixels within the original bounding box of the selected object remain background pixels in the output.

transformation:
  - action: identify_objects
    description: Find all distinct objects in the input grid.
  - action: calculate_size
    description: Determine the pixel count for each identified object.
  - action: select_largest
    description: Choose the object with the maximum pixel count. (Assumes no ties based on examples).
  - action: determine_bounding_box
    description: Find the coordinates of the minimal bounding box for the selected object.
  - action: extract_and_crop
    description: Create a new grid containing only the portion of the input grid defined by the bounding box of the selected object. Pixels not belonging to the selected object within this box should be set to the background color (0).

relationships:
  - The output object corresponds to the input object with the highest pixel count.
  - The output grid dimensions are determined by the bounding box of the selected input object.
