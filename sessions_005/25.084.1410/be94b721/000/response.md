Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain a white background (color 0) and several distinct "objects". Each object is a contiguous shape composed of pixels of a single non-white color (1-9).
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is a cropped version of one of the objects from the input grid. The output grid's dimensions are determined by the bounding box of the selected object. Pixels within the output grid that were part of the selected object retain their original color, while any other pixels within that bounding box area (originally background or part of other objects) become white (color 0).
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves selecting one specific object from the input and isolating it in the output.
4.  **Selection Criterion:** By comparing the objects in each input grid with the object present in the corresponding output grid, a pattern emerges. Let's count the pixels for each object in the examples:
    *   **train_1:** Azure (8) has 7 pixels, Orange (7) has 6 pixels, Red (2) has 4 pixels. Output is the Azure object.
    *   **train_2:** Yellow (4) has 6 pixels, Green (3) has 5 pixels, Magenta (6) has 3 pixels. Output is the Yellow object.
    *   **train_3:** Red (2) has 6 pixels, Azure (8) has 4 pixels, Orange (7) has 3 pixels. Output is the Red object.
    *   **train_4:** Red (2) has 7 pixels, Blue (1) has 5 pixels, Green (3) has 4 pixels. Output is the Red object.
    The object selected for the output is consistently the one with the largest number of pixels (i.e., the largest area).
5.  **Cropping:** The output grid seems to be the minimal bounding box containing the selected object. Any background pixels (color 0) that fall within this bounding box in the input grid remain background pixels in the output grid.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Extract the largest object based on pixel count and crop the output to its bounding box.

definitions:
  - object: A contiguous group of pixels sharing the same non-white color. Connectivity is typically adjacent (up, down, left, right).
  - background: Pixels with color 0 (white).
  - pixel_count: The total number of pixels belonging to an object.
  - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of an object.

input_features:
  - multiple_objects: Each input grid contains two or more distinct objects.
  - background_present: All input grids have a background color (0).
  - object_colors: Objects are composed of single, non-white colors (1-9).

output_features:
  - single_object: Each output grid contains exactly one object pattern.
  - cropped: The output grid dimensions match the bounding box of the selected object.
  - background_preservation: Background pixels within the original bounding box of the selected object remain background pixels in the output.

transformation:
  - action: identify_objects
    description: Find all distinct objects in the input grid.
  - action: calculate_size
    description: Determine the pixel count for each identified object.
  - action: select_largest
    description: Choose the object with the maximum pixel count. (Assumes no ties based on examples).
  - action: determine_bounding_box
    description: Find the coordinates of the minimal bounding box for the selected object.
  - action: extract_and_crop
    description: Create a new grid containing only the portion of the input grid defined by the bounding box of the selected object. Pixels not belonging to the selected object within this box should be set to the background color (0).

relationships:
  - The output object corresponds to the input object with the highest pixel count.
  - The output grid dimensions are determined by the bounding box of the selected input object.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is defined as a connected group of pixels of the same non-white color. Use adjacency (up, down, left, right neighbors) to determine connectivity.
2.  For each identified object, count the total number of pixels it comprises.
3.  Select the object that has the maximum pixel count.
4.  Determine the bounding box of the selected object (the minimum and maximum row and column indices that encompass all pixels of the object).
5.  Create a new output grid whose dimensions are derived from the height and width of the bounding box.
6.  Iterate through each cell within the bounding box coordinates in the original input grid.
7.  If the input grid cell at a specific coordinate (within the bounding box) belongs to the selected object (i.e., has the same color as the selected object and is part of that connected component), copy its color to the corresponding position in the new output grid (adjusting for the offset of the bounding box).
8.  If the input grid cell within the bounding box does *not* belong to the selected object (it's either background or part of a different object), set the corresponding cell in the new output grid to the background color (0).
9.  Return the newly created output grid.
