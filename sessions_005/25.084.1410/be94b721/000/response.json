            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain a white background (color 0) and several distinct \"objects\". Each object is a contiguous shape composed of pixels of a single non-white color (1-9).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is a cropped version of one of the objects from the input grid. The output grid's dimensions are determined by the bounding box of the selected object. Pixels within the output grid that were part of the selected object retain their original color, while any other pixels within that bounding box area (originally background or part of other objects) become white (color 0).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves selecting one specific object from the input and isolating it in the output.\n4.  **Selection Criterion:** By comparing the objects in each input grid with the object present in the corresponding output grid, a pattern emerges. Let's count the pixels for each object in the examples:\n    *   **train_1:** Azure (8) has 7 pixels, Orange (7) has 6 pixels, Red (2) has 4 pixels. Output is the Azure object.\n    *   **train_2:** Yellow (4) has 6 pixels, Green (3) has 5 pixels, Magenta (6) has 3 pixels. Output is the Yellow object.\n    *   **train_3:** Red (2) has 6 pixels, Azure (8) has 4 pixels, Orange (7) has 3 pixels. Output is the Red object.\n    *   **train_4:** Red (2) has 7 pixels, Blue (1) has 5 pixels, Green (3) has 4 pixels. Output is the Red object.\n    The object selected for the output is consistently the one with the largest number of pixels (i.e., the largest area).\n5.  **Cropping:** The output grid seems to be the minimal bounding box containing the selected object. Any background pixels (color 0) that fall within this bounding box in the input grid remain background pixels in the output grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
