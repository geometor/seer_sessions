"""
Identify all distinct contiguous objects of non-background color in the input grid.
Calculate the size (pixel count) of each object.
Select the object with the largest size.
Determine the bounding box of this largest object.
Create an output grid with dimensions matching the bounding box.
Populate the output grid by copying the pixels of the largest object from the input grid within its bounding box.
Pixels within the bounding box that were not part of the largest object in the input grid are set to the background color (0).
