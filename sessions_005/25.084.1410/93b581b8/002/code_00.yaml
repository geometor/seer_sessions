task_description: Places four 2x2 solid-colored squares in the corners of the grid, based on the colors found in a unique 2x2 non-background object within the input grid.
grid_properties:
  - size: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - background_color: White (0) is the background color.
objects:
  - object_type: source_object
    description: A single contiguous 2x2 block of non-background colored pixels exists in the input grid.
    properties:
      - shape: 2x2
      - pixels: Contains four pixels, identified as top-left (TL), top-right (TR), bottom-left (BL), bottom-right (BR).
      - colors: The colors of these four pixels determine the output.
  - object_type: corner_squares
    description: Four 2x2 solid-colored squares placed in the output grid.
    properties:
      - count: 4
      - shape: 2x2
      - placement:
          - Top-left corner of the grid (coordinates 0, 0).
          - Top-right corner of the grid (coordinates 0, width-2).
          - Bottom-left corner of the grid (coordinates height-2, 0).
          - Bottom-right corner of the grid (coordinates height-2, width-2).
      - color_rule: Determined by a diagonal swap from the source_object's pixels.
          - Top-left square color = source_object BR pixel color.
          - Top-right square color = source_object BL pixel color.
          - Bottom-left square color = source_object TR pixel color.
          - Bottom-right square color = source_object TL pixel color.
transformation:
  - step: 1
    action: Initialize the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
  - step: 2
    action: Locate the unique 2x2 non-background source_object in the input grid.
  - step: 3
    action: Identify the colors of the four pixels (TL, TR, BL, BR) within the source_object.
  - step: 4
    action: Draw four 2x2 solid-colored squares onto the output grid at the specified corner locations, using the colors determined by the diagonal swap rule. These squares overwrite the existing content of the output grid within their 2x2 areas.
