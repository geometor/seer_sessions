Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid is a 6x6 grid primarily filled with the background color white (0).
2.  **Central Object:** Within each input grid, there is a single, contiguous 2x2 object composed of four different non-white colors. The position of this object varies across the examples (top-left quadrant in train_1, center-right in train_2 and train_3).
3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid retains the same 6x6 dimensions as the input.
4.  **Preservation:** The original 2x2 colored object from the input grid is preserved in its exact location and composition in the output grid.
5.  **New Corner Objects:** The key transformation involves adding four new 2x2 solid-colored objects to the output grid. These new objects are placed precisely in the four corners of the grid: top-left (rows 0-1, cols 0-1), top-right (rows 0-1, cols 4-5), bottom-left (rows 4-5, cols 0-1), and bottom-right (rows 4-5, cols 4-5).
6.  **Color Mapping:** The color of each new corner object is determined by the color of a specific pixel within the *original* 2x2 object. The relationship is based on diagonal opposition:
    *   The color of the *top-left* pixel of the original object becomes the color of the *bottom-right* corner object in the output.
    *   The color of the *top-right* pixel of the original object becomes the color of the *bottom-left* corner object in the output.
    *   The color of the *bottom-left* pixel of the original object becomes the color of the *top-right* corner object in the output.
    *   The color of the *bottom-right* pixel of the original object becomes the color of the *top-left* corner object in the output.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: Analyze a 6x6 input grid containing a single 2x2 non-white object and generate an output grid by adding four 2x2 corner objects whose colors are derived from the original object's pixels.

grid_properties:
  size: 6x6
  background_color: 0 # white

input_elements:
  - object_type: central_object
    shape: 2x2 rectangle
    composition: contiguous block of 4 different non-white pixels
    quantity: 1
    location: variable within the grid, but not overlapping edges

output_elements:
  - object_type: original_object
    description: A copy of the input grid's central_object.
    location: Same as in the input grid.
  - object_type: corner_object
    shape: 2x2 rectangle
    composition: solid color
    quantity: 4
    locations:
      - top_left: (rows 0-1, cols 0-1)
      - top_right: (rows 0-1, cols 4-5) # Assuming 6x6 grid, cols width-2 to width-1
      - bottom_left: (rows 4-5, cols 0-1) # Assuming 6x6 grid, rows height-2 to height-1
      - bottom_right: (rows 4-5, cols 4-5) # Assuming 6x6 grid, rows height-2 to height-1, cols width-2 to width-1

transformation_rules:
  - rule: Identify the single 2x2 non-white object in the input grid.
  - rule: Preserve the identified object in its original location in the output grid.
  - rule: Determine the colors of the four pixels within the identified object (TopLeft_Color, TopRight_Color, BottomLeft_Color, BottomRight_Color).
  - rule: Create four new 2x2 solid-colored objects in the output grid.
  - rule: Place the new objects in the four corners of the output grid.
  - rule: Map the colors based on diagonal opposition:
      - Top-left corner object color = BottomRight_Color of original object.
      - Top-right corner object color = BottomLeft_Color of original object.
      - Bottom-left corner object color = TopRight_Color of original object.
      - Bottom-right corner object color = TopLeft_Color of original object.

assumptions:
  - Input grid always contains exactly one 2x2 non-white object.
  - Input grid size is consistent (6x6 in examples, but rule should generalize).
  - The 2x2 object in the input does not touch the absolute edges of the grid (allowing space for corner objects).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Locate the 2x2 block of non-white pixels in the input grid. Let the coordinates of its top-left pixel be (r, c).
3.  Identify the colors of the four pixels within this 2x2 block:
    *   `color_TL` = color at (r, c)
    *   `color_TR` = color at (r, c+1)
    *   `color_BL` = color at (r+1, c)
    *   `color_BR` = color at (r+1, c+1)
4.  Determine the dimensions of the grid (height, width).
5.  Fill the 2x2 area at the top-left corner of the output grid (rows 0 to 1, columns 0 to 1) with `color_BR`.
6.  Fill the 2x2 area at the top-right corner of the output grid (rows 0 to 1, columns width-2 to width-1) with `color_BL`.
7.  Fill the 2x2 area at the bottom-left corner of the output grid (rows height-2 to height-1, columns 0 to 1) with `color_TR`.
8.  Fill the 2x2 area at the bottom-right corner of the output grid (rows height-2 to height-1, columns width-2 to width-1) with `color_TL`.
9.  Return the modified output grid.
