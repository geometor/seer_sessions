The position of this object varies across the examples (top-left quadrant in train_1, center-right in train_2 and train_3).\n3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid retains the same 6x6 dimensions as the input.\n4.  **Preservation:** The original 2x2 colored object from the input grid is preserved in its exact location and composition in the output grid.\n5.  **New Corner Objects:** The key transformation involves adding four new 2x2 solid-colored objects to the output grid. These new objects are placed precisely in the four corners of the grid: top-left (rows 0-1, cols 0-1), top-right (rows 0-1, cols 4-5), bottom-left (rows 4-5, cols 0-1), and bottom-right (rows 4-5, cols 4-5).\n6.  **Color Mapping:** The color of each new corner object is determined by the color of a specific pixel within the *original* 2x2 object. The relationship is based on diagonal opposition:\n    *   The color of the *top-left* pixel of the original object becomes the color of the *bottom-right* corner object in the output.\n    *   The color of the *top-right* pixel of the original object becomes the color of the *bottom-left* corner object in the output.\n    *   The color of the *bottom-left* pixel of the original object becomes the color of the *top-right* corner object in the output.\n    *   The color of the *bottom-right* pixel of the original object becomes the color of the *top-left* corner object in the output.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
