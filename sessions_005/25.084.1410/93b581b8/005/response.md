```python
"""
Transforms an input grid by first copying it, then identifying a unique 2x2 
non-background object within the original grid. Four new 2x2 solid-colored 
squares are drawn onto the copied grid's corners. The color of each corner 
square is determined by the color of the diagonally opposite pixel within the 
identified 2x2 object:
- Top-left corner gets the color of the original object's bottom-right pixel.
- Top-right corner gets the color of the original object's bottom-left pixel.
- Bottom-left corner gets the color of the original object's top-right pixel.
- Bottom-right corner gets the color of the original object's top-left pixel.
These corner squares overwrite any existing content in those 2x2 areas.
