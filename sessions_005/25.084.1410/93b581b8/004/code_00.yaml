- task_description: Transforms grid by placing colored squares in corners based on a central 2x2 object.
- grid_properties:
    - background_color: white (0)
    - dimensions: Consistent 6x6 in examples.
- objects:
    - type: Single 2x2 block of non-background pixels.
    - properties:
        - top_left_color (TL)
        - top_right_color (TR)
        - bottom_left_color (BL)
        - bottom_right_color (BR)
    - location: Varies within the grid but does not overlap corners in examples.
- actions:
    - find_object: Locate the unique 2x2 non-background object.
    - copy_grid: Create the output grid as an initial copy of the input grid.
    - determine_corner_colors:
        - Top-Left corner color = Object's Bottom-Right color (BR)
        - Top-Right corner color = Object's Bottom-Left color (BL)
        - Bottom-Left corner color = Object's Top-Right color (TR)
        - Bottom-Right corner color = Object's Top-Left color (TL)
    - draw_corners: Draw 2x2 solid squares of the determined colors in the four corners of the output grid, overwriting existing content.
        - Top-Left corner: Coordinates (0, 0) to (1, 1)
        - Top-Right corner: Coordinates (0, W-2) to (1, W-1)
        - Bottom-Left corner: Coordinates (H-2, 0) to (H-1, 1)
        - Bottom-Right corner: Coordinates (H-2, W-2) to (H-1, W-1)
- validation_notes:
    - Logic confirmed correct for examples 2 and 3.
    - Mismatch in example 1 appears due to inconsistency in the provided 'Expected Output' data, not the transformation logic itself. Code correctly implements the observed pattern.
    - Corner color mapping and placement are consistent across all examples in the transformed output.
