The red pixels remain unchanged in position and color.\n4.  **Pattern Identification:** The change from white to yellow depends on the local neighborhood of the white pixel in the input grid. Specifically, it relates to the number and arrangement of neighboring red pixels.\n5.  **Rule Discovery:** By examining the examples, it appears that a white pixel changes to yellow if and only if it has exactly two red neighbors, and these two red neighbors are diagonally opposite each other relative to the white pixel's position. For a white pixel at `(r, c)`, its red neighbors must be at `(r-1, c-1)` and `(r+1, c+1)` OR at `(r-1, c+1)` and `(r+1, c-1)`. All other pixels retain their original color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
