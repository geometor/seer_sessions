elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing the input and output.
    properties:
      - height: 3 (constant across examples)
      - width: Variable (15, 10, 18 in examples)
      - pixels: Contains pixels with specific colors and positions.

  - element: pixel
    description: A single cell within the grid.
    properties:
      - color: Integer value (0-9), representing white, red, or yellow in this task.
      - position: Coordinates (row, column) within the grid.
      - neighbors: The 8 pixels directly or diagonally adjacent to the pixel.

relationships:
  - relationship: adjacency
    description: Pixels can be neighbors (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
  - relationship: diagonal_opposition
    description: Two neighboring pixels are diagonally opposite relative to a central pixel. (e.g., top-left and bottom-right neighbors relative to the center).

transformation:
  - action: iterate_pixels
    description: Process each pixel in the input grid one by one.
  - action: check_condition
    description: For each white pixel, check its neighbors.
    conditions:
      - color is white (0).
      - count of red (2) neighbors is exactly 2.
      - the two red neighbors are diagonally opposite each other relative to the white pixel.
  - action: change_color
    description: If the conditions are met for a white pixel, change its color to yellow (4) in the output grid.
  - action: copy_color
    description: If the conditions are not met, or if the pixel is not white, copy its original color to the output grid.

constants:
  - white: 0
  - red: 2
  - yellow: 4
