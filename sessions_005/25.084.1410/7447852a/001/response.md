"""
Transforms an input grid by changing specific white pixels to yellow based on their red neighbors.
A white pixel (0) changes to yellow (4) if and only if it has exactly two red (2) neighbors,
and these two red neighbors are diagonally opposite each other relative to the white pixel.
All other pixels retain their original color. Red pixels (2) remain unchanged.
