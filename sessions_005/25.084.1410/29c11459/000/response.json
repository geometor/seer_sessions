The output grid maintains these original colored pixels but fills the white space *between* them in that specific row. The filling process seems symmetrical: the color from the left pixel extends rightwards, the color from the right pixel extends leftwards, and they meet exactly in the middle column (column 5), which is colored gray (5). The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the color and column index of the left non-white pixel (`left_color`, `left_col`).\n    b.  Identify the color and column index of the right non-white pixel (`right_color`, `right_col`).\n    c.  Determine the midpoint column index (`mid_col`). In these examples, it's consistently column 5.\n    d.  Fill the pixels in the output grid's corresponding row:\n        i.
