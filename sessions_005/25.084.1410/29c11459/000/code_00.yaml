task_type: fill_gap
grid_properties:
  size: constant (5x11 in examples)
  background_color: white (0)
input_features:
  - object_type: pair_of_pixels
    count: 1 pair per grid
    properties:
      - non-white color
      - located in the same row
      - positioned at column 0 and column 10
output_features:
  - object_type: filled_row_segment
    source_row: row containing the input pixel pair
    properties:
      - spans columns 1 through 9 between the original pixels
      - left_half_fill: uses color of the pixel at column 0
      - right_half_fill: uses color of the pixel at column 10
      - midpoint_fill: column 5 is filled with gray (5)
  - unchanged_elements: all pixels outside the filled row segment remain identical to the input.
relationships:
  - input pixel pair defines the row and the boundary colors for the fill.
  - the midpoint column (column 5) acts as a separator and is marked distinctly with gray.
constants:
  - background_color: 0
  - midpoint_color: 5
  - grid_width: 11 (in examples)
  - left_pixel_col: 0
  - right_pixel_col: 10
  - midpoint_col: 5
