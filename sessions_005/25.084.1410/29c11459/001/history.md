Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

Both examples show an input grid that is mostly white (0) except for two colored pixels located in the same row, one at the far left (column 0) and one at the far right (column 10). The output grid maintains these original colored pixels but fills the white space *between* them in that specific row. The filling process seems symmetrical: the color from the left pixel extends rightwards, the color from the right pixel extends leftwards, and they meet exactly in the middle column (column 5), which is colored gray (5). The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: fill_gap
grid_properties:
  size: constant (5x11 in examples)
  background_color: white (0)
input_features:
  - object_type: pair_of_pixels
    count: 1 pair per grid
    properties:
      - non-white color
      - located in the same row
      - positioned at column 0 and column 10
output_features:
  - object_type: filled_row_segment
    source_row: row containing the input pixel pair
    properties:
      - spans columns 1 through 9 between the original pixels
      - left_half_fill: uses color of the pixel at column 0
      - right_half_fill: uses color of the pixel at column 10
      - midpoint_fill: column 5 is filled with gray (5)
  - unchanged_elements: all pixels outside the filled row segment remain identical to the input.
relationships:
  - input pixel pair defines the row and the boundary colors for the fill.
  - the midpoint column (column 5) acts as a separator and is marked distinctly with gray.
constants:
  - background_color: 0
  - midpoint_color: 5
  - grid_width: 11 (in examples)
  - left_pixel_col: 0
  - right_pixel_col: 10
  - midpoint_col: 5
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3.  For each row, check if it contains exactly two non-white pixels.
4.  If a row contains exactly two non-white pixels:
    a.  Identify the color and column index of the left non-white pixel (`left_color`, `left_col`).
    b.  Identify the color and column index of the right non-white pixel (`right_color`, `right_col`).
    c.  Determine the midpoint column index (`mid_col`). In these examples, it's consistently column 5.
    d.  Fill the pixels in the output grid's corresponding row:
        i.  From column `left_col + 1` up to (but not including) `mid_col`, set the pixel color to `left_color`.
        ii. From column `right_col - 1` down to (but not including) `mid_col`, set the pixel color to `right_color`.
        iii.Set the pixel color at `mid_col` to gray (5).
    e.  Stop searching for rows, as the transformation applies to only one row.
5.  Return the modified grid.
