      type: 2D array
      height: 3
      width: 3
      pixels:
        colors: [blue (1), azure (8)]
      relationship_to_input: Is an exact 3x3 subgrid of the Input Grid.

  - description: 3x3 Subgrids within Input
    properties:
      height: 3
      width: 3
      location: Defined by top-left corner (row, column) within the Input Grid.
      pixel_composition: Can contain white, blue, and/or azure pixels.

filtering_criteria:
  - step: 1
    description: Identify candidate 3x3 subgrids.
    conditions:
      - Must not contain any white (0) pixels.
      - Must contain at least one blue (1) pixel.
      - Must contain at least one azure (8) pixel.

selection_criterion:
  - step: 2
    description: Select the final output subgrid from the candidates.
    method: Find the candidate subgrid with the maximum count of blue (1) pixels.
    assumption: There will be only one candidate subgrid with the maximum blue pixel count.

transformation_summary:
  - action: Scan the Input Grid for all possible 3x3 subgrids.
  - action: Filter these subgrids based on the `filtering_criteria`.
  - action: Apply the `selection_criterion` to the filtered candidates.
  - action: Output the selected 3x3 subgrid.
