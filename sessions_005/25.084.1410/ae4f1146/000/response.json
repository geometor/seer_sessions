White appears to be a background or empty color. Blue and azure form patterns or objects within the input grid.\n3.  **Transformation:** The output grid is an exact 3x3 subgrid extracted from the input grid. The core task is to identify the correct 3x3 subgrid to extract.\n4.  **Pattern Identification:** The input grids contain various arrangements of blue and azure pixels, sometimes forming solid blocks, sometimes scattered. There appear to be multiple potential 3x3 subgrids composed entirely of blue and/or azure pixels within each input.\n5.  **Selection Criteria:** A specific rule is needed to select the correct 3x3 subgrid among the candidates. Observing the examples, the target subgrid consistently meets the following criteria:\n    *   It contains *no* white (0) pixels.\n    *   It contains *both* blue (1) pixels and azure (8) pixels.\n    *   Among all subgrids meeting the first two criteria, the target subgrid is the one with the *maximum number* of blue (1) pixels. The examples suggest this maximum is unique.\n\n### Facts\n\n"

A 3x3 subgrid can be defined by its top-left corner coordinates (row `r`, column `c`), where `r` ranges from 0 to 6 and `c` ranges from 0 to 6.\n2.  For each 3x3 subgrid, check if it meets the following conditions:\n    a.  It contains zero pixels with the value white (0).\n    b.  It contains at least one pixel with the value blue (1).\n    c.  It contains at least one pixel with the value azure (8).\n3.  Collect all subgrids that satisfy all three conditions from step 2. These are the \"candidate\" subgrids.\n4.  If no candidate subgrids are found, the process cannot proceed (though this is unlikely based on the examples).\n5.  If one or more candidate subgrids are found, calculate the number of blue (1) pixels within each candidate subgrid.\n6.  Identify the candidate subgrid that has the highest count of blue (1) pixels.\n7.  The 3x3 subgrid identified in step 6 is the final output grid."
