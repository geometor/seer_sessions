No colors are added, removed, or changed.\n4.  **Spatial Rearrangement:** The positions of the pixels are altered between the input and output. Comparing the rows reveals a clear pattern:\n    *   The first row of the input becomes the last row of the output.\n    *   The second row of the input becomes the second-to-last row of the output.\n    *   This pattern continues, with the last row of the input becoming the first row of the output.\n5.  **Transformation Type:** The transformation seems to be a reflection or flip of the entire grid along its horizontal axis. The order of rows is inverted, while the content within each row remains unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
