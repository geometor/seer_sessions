task_type: grid_transformation
components:
  - input_grid:
      type: 2D_array
      description: The initial grid of pixels.
  - output_grid:
      type: 2D_array
      description: The transformed grid of pixels.
properties:
  - dimensions_match: Input and output grids always have the same height and width.
  - pixel_conservation: All pixels from the input grid are present in the output grid; their values are unchanged.
transformation:
  - name: vertical_flip
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: The order of the rows in the input grid is reversed to produce the output grid.
relationship:
  - The row at index `i` in the input grid becomes the row at index `height - 1 - i` in the output grid, where `height` is the total number of rows and `i` is the 0-based row index.
