Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each example consists of a single input grid and a single output grid.
2.  **Grid Dimensions:** In all provided training examples, the output grid has the same dimensions (height and width) as the corresponding input grid.
3.  **Pixel Conservation:** The set of pixel values (colors) present in the input grid appears to be identical to the set of pixel values in the output grid. No colors are added, removed, or changed.
4.  **Spatial Rearrangement:** The positions of the pixels are altered between the input and output. Comparing the rows reveals a clear pattern:
    *   The first row of the input becomes the last row of the output.
    *   The second row of the input becomes the second-to-last row of the output.
    *   This pattern continues, with the last row of the input becoming the first row of the output.
5.  **Transformation Type:** The transformation seems to be a reflection or flip of the entire grid along its horizontal axis. The order of rows is inverted, while the content within each row remains unchanged.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
components:
  - input_grid:
      type: 2D_array
      description: The initial grid of pixels.
  - output_grid:
      type: 2D_array
      description: The transformed grid of pixels.
properties:
  - dimensions_match: Input and output grids always have the same height and width.
  - pixel_conservation: All pixels from the input grid are present in the output grid; their values are unchanged.
transformation:
  - name: vertical_flip
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: The order of the rows in the input grid is reversed to produce the output grid.
relationship:
  - The row at index `i` in the input grid becomes the row at index `height - 1 - i` in the output grid, where `height` is the total number of rows and `i` is the 0-based row index.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Take the input grid.
2.  Determine the height of the input grid.
3.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
4.  Iterate through the rows of the input grid from the top (row index 0) to the bottom (row index `height - 1`).
5.  For each input row at index `i`, place that entire row into the output grid at index `height - 1 - i`.
6.  The resulting grid is the output.
