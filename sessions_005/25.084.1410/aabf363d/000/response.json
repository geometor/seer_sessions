The rest of the grid is composed of the background color (white, 0).\n*   **Output Grids:** In both output grids, the large object has changed its color to match the color of the single pixel from the input grid. The original single pixel in the bottom-left corner has been replaced by the background color (white, 0).\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a \"recoloring\" operation. The color of the large object is determined by the color of a single, isolated pixel elsewhere in the grid. This isolated pixel is then effectively removed or \"used up\" in the process, reverting to the background color.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
