"""
This transformation processes a 9x5 input grid divided into two 4x5 sections by a yellow separator line at row index 4. 
It creates a 4x5 output grid based on a pixel-wise combination of the two input sections.

1.  The input grid has a top section (rows 0-3) containing white (0) and red (2) pixels, and a bottom section (rows 5-8) containing white (0) and blue (1) pixels, separated by a yellow (4) line at row 4.
2.  An output grid of size 4x5 is initialized, corresponding to the dimensions of the input sections.
3.  For each position (r, c) in the 4x5 grid:
    a.  The color `top_color` is taken from the input grid at `(r, c)`.
    b.  The color `bottom_color` is taken from the input grid at `(r + 5, c)`.
    c.  If `top_color` is red (2) OR `bottom_color` is blue (1), the output grid at `(r, c)` is set to green (3).
    d.  Otherwise, the output grid at `(r, c)` is set to white (0).
4.  The resulting 4x5 grid is returned.
