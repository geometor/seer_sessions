Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consistently have a dimension of 9 rows by 5 columns. A distinct feature is a horizontal line composed entirely of yellow (4) pixels located at the 5th row (index 4). This line visually divides the input grid into two sections:
    *   **Top Section:** Rows 0 to 3 (4 rows x 5 columns). This section contains white (0) and red (2) pixels.
    *   **Bottom Section:** Rows 5 to 8 (4 rows x 5 columns). This section contains white (0) and blue (1) pixels.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids consistently have a dimension of 4 rows by 5 columns. This size matches exactly the size of the top section of the input grid. The output grids contain only white (0) and green (3) pixels.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation seems to involve combining information from the top and bottom sections of the input grid to produce the output grid. The yellow line acts purely as a separator and doesn't contribute directly to the output pixel values. The spatial correspondence between the top input section, bottom input section, and the output grid is key. Specifically, the pixel at `(row, col)` in the output seems determined by the pixels at `(row, col)` in the top input section and `(row, col)` in the bottom input section (adjusting for the offset caused by the separator).
4.  **Color Logic:** Comparing the colors at corresponding positions:
    *   Input Top: White (0) or Red (2)
    *   Input Bottom: White (0) or Blue (1)
    *   Output: White (0) or Green (3)
    A Green (3) pixel appears in the output if the corresponding pixel in the *top* section is Red (2) *OR* the corresponding pixel in the *bottom* section is Blue (1). If neither of these conditions is met (i.e., the top pixel is White (0) *AND* the bottom pixel is White (0)), the output pixel is White (0). This suggests a logical OR operation based on the presence of the "active" colors (Red and Blue) in the respective input sections.

## Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - name: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimension: 9 rows x 5 columns
      - contains_separator: true
        separator_color: yellow (4)
        separator_row_index: 4
      - top_section:
          rows: 0-3
          colors: [white (0), red (2)]
      - bottom_section:
          rows: 5-8
          colors: [white (0), blue (1)]
  - name: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimension: 4 rows x 5 columns (matches input top section)
      - colors: [white (0), green (3)]

transformation_rule:
  - scope: pixel-wise combination
  - applies_to: corresponding pixels in input top section and input bottom section
  - logic: |
      For each coordinate (row, col) within the 4x5 grid dimensions:
      Let top_pixel be the color at input_grid[row][col].
      Let bottom_pixel be the color at input_grid[row + 5][col].
      The output_grid[row][col] is determined as follows:
      IF (top_pixel is red (2)) OR (bottom_pixel is blue (1)) THEN
        output_grid[row][col] = green (3)
      ELSE
        output_grid[row][col] = white (0)
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the horizontal separator line composed entirely of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
2.  Define the 'top input section' as the grid portion above the separator line (rows 0-3).
3.  Define the 'bottom input section' as the grid portion below the separator line (rows 5-8).
4.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the 'top input section' (4 rows x 5 columns).
5.  For each row index `r` from 0 to 3 and each column index `c` from 0 to 4:
    a.  Get the color `top_color` from the 'top input section' at position `(r, c)`.
    b.  Get the color `bottom_color` from the 'bottom input section' at position `(r, c)` (which corresponds to the original input grid position `(r + 5, c)`).
    c.  Check if `top_color` is red (2) or if `bottom_color` is blue (1).
    d.  If the condition in step 5c is true, set the color of the output grid at position `(r, c)` to green (3).
    e.  Otherwise (if the condition in step 5c is false), set the color of the output grid at position `(r, c)` to white (0).
6.  Return the completed output grid.
