Rows 0 and 2 display an alternating pattern, starting either with yellow-white or white-yellow. The output grids maintain the same dimensions and the white pixels remain unchanged. The transformation involves changing specific yellow (4) pixels to magenta (6). The positions where these changes occur follow a distinct pattern based on the row index and the initial configuration of rows 0 and 2.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
