Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves taking an input grid and transforming it into a larger output grid. The key elements are:

1.  **Input Grid:** A rectangular grid of colored pixels.
2.  **Output Grid:** A wider rectangular grid of the same height as the input.
3.  **Transformation:** The input grid appears to be embedded within the output grid, but with each row shifted horizontally.
4.  **Shift Pattern:** The shift is diagonal or sheared. The top row is shifted the most to the right, and each subsequent row is shifted one less position to the right, with the bottom row having no horizontal shift relative to the leftmost column it occupies.
5.  **Padding:** The areas in the output grid not occupied by the shifted input grid are filled with the 'white' color (0).

**Facts:**


```yaml
- task: Grid transformation involving diagonal embedding and padding.
- grid_dimensions:
    input_height: H
    input_width: W
    output_height: H
    output_width: W + H - 1
- objects:
    - type: input_grid
      description: The entire input grid treated as a single object to be placed.
    - type: output_grid
      description: The target grid, initially filled with 'white' (0).
    - type: background_pixel
      color: white (0)
- relationships:
    - The output grid contains the input grid.
    - The height of the input and output grids are the same.
    - The width of the output grid depends on both the width and height of the input grid.
- actions:
    - Create an output grid of dimensions H x (W + H - 1), filled with 'white' (0).
    - Iterate through each row `r` (from 0 to H-1) of the input grid.
    - Calculate a horizontal shift `s` for the current row `r` using the formula: `s = H - 1 - r`.
    - Copy the pixels from the input row `r` (columns `c` from 0 to W-1) to the output grid at row `r`, starting at column `c + s`.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height (`H`) and width (`W`) of the input grid.
2.  Calculate the width of the output grid as `output_width = W + H - 1`. The height of the output grid is the same as the input grid (`H`).
3.  Create a new grid (the output grid) with dimensions `H` rows and `output_width` columns, filling it entirely with the 'white' color (0).
4.  For each row `r` in the input grid (from row 0 to row `H-1`):
    a.  Calculate the horizontal starting position (shift) for this row in the output grid: `shift = H - 1 - r`.
    b.  For each column `c` in the input grid (from column 0 to column `W-1`):
        i.  Copy the pixel value from the input grid at `(r, c)` to the output grid at `(r, c + shift)`.
5.  The resulting grid is the final output.
