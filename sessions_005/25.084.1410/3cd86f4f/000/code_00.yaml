- task: Grid transformation involving diagonal embedding and padding.
- grid_dimensions:
    input_height: H
    input_width: W
    output_height: H
    output_width: W + H - 1
- objects:
    - type: input_grid
      description: The entire input grid treated as a single object to be placed.
    - type: output_grid
      description: The target grid, initially filled with 'white' (0).
    - type: background_pixel
      color: white (0)
- relationships:
    - The output grid contains the input grid.
    - The height of the input and output grids are the same.
    - The width of the output grid depends on both the width and height of the input grid.
- actions:
    - Create an output grid of dimensions H x (W + H - 1), filled with 'white' (0).
    - Iterate through each row `r` (from 0 to H-1) of the input grid.
    - Calculate a horizontal shift `s` for the current row `r` using the formula: `s = H - 1 - r`.
    - Copy the pixels from the input row `r` (columns `c` from 0 to W-1) to the output grid at row `r`, starting at column `c + s`.
