The key elements are:\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** A rectangular grid of colored pixels.\n2.  **Output Grid:** A wider rectangular grid of the same height as the input.\n3.  **Transformation:** The input grid appears to be embedded within the output grid, but with each row shifted horizontally.\n4.  **Shift Pattern:** The shift is diagonal or sheared. The top row is shifted the most to the right, and each subsequent row is shifted one less position to the right, with the bottom row having no horizontal shift relative to the leftmost column it occupies.\n5.  **Padding:** The areas in the output grid not occupied by the shifted input grid are filled with the 'white' color (0).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
