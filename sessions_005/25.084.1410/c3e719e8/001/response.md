Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the most frequent non-white color in the input grid (selector_color).
2. Create an output grid 3 times the height and 3 times the width of the input grid, initialized to white (0).
3. Treat the output grid as a 3x3 grid of subgrids, each the size of the input grid.
4. Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the input grid.
5. If the color at input_grid[r][c] matches the selector_color, copy the entire original input grid into the corresponding subgrid location (r, c) in the output grid (top-left corner at r*H, c*W).
6. Otherwise, leave the corresponding subgrid area in the output grid as white.
