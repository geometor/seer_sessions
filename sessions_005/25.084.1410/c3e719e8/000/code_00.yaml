task_description: Create a larger grid based on the pattern of the most frequent color in the input grid.
grid_properties:
  - input_size: H x W (observed: 3x3)
  - output_size: 3H x 3W (observed: 9x9)
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties: contains various colors.
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties: composed of 3x3 subgrids.
  - name: subgrid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - size: H x W (same as input_grid)
      - content: either a copy of input_grid or all white (color 0).
  - name: selector_color
    type: color_value
    properties:
      - determined_by: most frequent color in the input_grid (excluding white).
relationships:
  - The output_grid is a 3x3 arrangement of subgrids.
  - The content of the subgrid at position (R, C) in the output_grid (where R and C are subgrid indices from 0 to 2) depends on the color of the pixel at position (R, C) in the input_grid.
actions:
  - Identify the most frequent color (selector_color) in the input_grid.
  - Create an output_grid of size 3H x 3W, initialized to white (0).
  - Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the input_grid:
    - If input_grid[r][c] == selector_color:
      - Copy the entire input_grid to the output_grid, placing its top-left corner at (r*H, c*W).
    - Else:
      - Ensure the corresponding subgrid area in the output_grid remains white (or explicitly fill it with white). # Initializing output to white makes this implicit.
