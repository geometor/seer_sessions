            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Size:** All input grids are 3x3. All output grids are 9x9. This immediately suggests the output grid is constructed by arranging 3x3 blocks, possibly related to the input grid, in a larger 3x3 structure.\n2.  **Structure:** Observing the output grids, they clearly consist of nine 3x3 subgrids. Some of these subgrids are exact copies of the input grid, while others are entirely white (color 0).\n3.  **Pattern Mapping:** The arrangement of the input grid copies versus the white grids in the output seems to correlate directly with the pattern of colors *within* the input grid itself.\n4.  **Selector Color:** In each example, there appears to be one specific color from the input grid that dictates where the copies of the input grid are placed in the output.\n    *   Example 1: The input grid has azure (8), gray (6), and green (3). Copies of the input grid appear in the output corresponding to the positions of the azure pixels in the input. Azure is the most frequent color in input 1 (5 times).\n    *   Example 2: The input grid has green (3), azure (8), orange (7), and maroon (9). Copies of the input grid appear in the output corresponding to the positions of the green pixels in the input. Green is the most frequent color in input 2 (3 times).\n    *   Example 3: The input grid has magenta (6), maroon (9), yellow (4), and azure (8). Copies of the input grid appear in the output corresponding to the positions of the maroon pixels in the input. Maroon is the most frequent color in input 3 (4 times).\n5.  **Transformation Rule:** The rule seems to be:\n    *   Identify the most frequent color in the input grid (excluding white, though white isn't present in these inputs).\n    *   Create an output grid that is 3 times the height and 3 times the width of the input.\n    *   Treat the output grid as a 3x3 grid of subgrids, where each subgrid has the same dimensions as the input.\n    *   For each cell `(r, c)` in the input grid:\n        *   If the color at `input[r][c]` is the most frequent color, place a copy of the original input grid into the output grid at the subgrid position `(r, c)`.\n        *   If the color at `input[r][c]` is *not* the most frequent color, place a white grid (all zeros) of the same size as the input into the output grid at the subgrid position `(r, c)`.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"

The top-left corner of this copied grid should be placed at row `r * H` and column `c * W` in the output grid.\n8.  If the color does not match the \"selector color\", do nothing (leave the corresponding HxW area in the output grid as white, as it was initialized).\n9.  After checking all cells in the input grid, the output grid is complete. Return the output grid."
