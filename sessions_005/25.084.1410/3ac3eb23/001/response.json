Iterate through each row of the working grid, from the top row (row index 0) \n   down to the second-to-last row (row index height - 2). Let the current \n   row index be r.\n3. Within each row r, iterate through each column (column index c) from left \n   to right (index 0 to width - 1).\n4. Examine the pixel at position (r, c) in the working grid. Let its color \n   be current_color.\n5. If current_color is not white (0):\n   a. Consider the target position (r + 1, c - 1) (down-left).\n      i. Check if this position is within the grid boundaries.\n      ii. If it is within bounds, check the color of the pixel at \n          (r + 1, c - 1) in the working grid.\n      iii. If the color at (r + 1, c - 1) is white (0), change its color \n           to current_color.\n   b. Consider the target position (r + 1, c + 1) (down-right).\n      i.
