task_description: Propagate colored pixels downwards in a cascading pattern.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  value_range: 0-9 (colors)
  background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: colored_pixel
    attributes:
      - color: (non-zero value)
      - position: (row, column)
    initial_state: Present in the input grid.
relationships:
  - type: propagation
    source: colored_pixel at (r, c) with color X
    target_potential:
      - position: (r+1, c-1)
      - position: (r+1, c+1)
    condition:
      - target position is within grid bounds.
      - target position currently holds the background color (0).
    action: Change the color of the target position to X.
transformation:
  - type: iterative_process
    scope: grid
    steps:
      - Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
      - Iterate through rows `r` from 0 up to `height - 2`.
      - For each column `c` from 0 up to `width - 1`:
          - Identify the color `X` at `(r, c)` in the current state of the output grid.
          - If `X` is not the background color (0):
              - Apply the propagation relationship to potentially color pixels at `(r+1, c-1)` and `(r+1, c+1)` in the output grid according to the specified conditions.
  - result: The final state of the output grid after all iterations.
