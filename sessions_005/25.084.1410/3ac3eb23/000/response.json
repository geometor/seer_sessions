The original non-white pixels from the input persist in the output. Additionally, new non-white pixels appear below the original ones, forming a branching or cascading pattern downwards.\n3.  **Color Preservation:** The color of the cascading pixels matches the color of the original source pixel.\n4.  **Cascade Pattern:** For each non-white pixel at `(row, col)`, new pixels of the same color are potentially generated in the row below (`row + 1`) at positions `(row + 1, col - 1)` and `(row + 1, col + 1)`.\n5.  **Conditions for Generation:** A new pixel is generated at a target position only if:\n    *   The target position is within the grid boundaries.\n    *   The target position in the grid is currently white (0). If multiple cascades might write to the same location, the first one to \"claim\" the white pixel determines its color. (Observation: in the examples, the propagation seems to happen row by row, so conflicts within the same row generation step don't seem possible based on the `(r+1, c-1)` and `(r+1, c+1)` rule).\n6.  **Iteration:** The cascading process repeats row by row. Pixels generated in row `r+1` can themselves generate new pixels in row `r+2`, following the same rules.\n7.  **Independence:** If there are multiple initial non-white pixels, each one initiates its own cascade independently, using its specific color.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
