"""
Simulates a downward diagonal color propagation process for two rows below the
last initial colored row, identifies this 2-row section as a repeating pattern, 
and tiles this pattern vertically downwards to fill the remaining grid space.

1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Find the index of the last row (`max_r_init`) containing any non-white 
   pixels in the input grid. If none exist, return the copy.
3. Simulate diagonal propagation for the two rows immediately below `max_r_init`. 
   For `r` from `max_r_init + 1` up to `min(height, max_r_init + 3)`:
   - For each column `c`:
     - If `output_grid[r, c]` is white (0):
       - Get colors `color_ul` from `output_grid[r-1, c-1]` and `color_ur` 
         from `output_grid[r-1, c+1]` (treat out-of-bounds as white).
       - Apply rules: If one source is colored, use that color. If both are 
         the same color, use that color. Otherwise, remain white.
4. Identify the pattern block: Extract rows `max_r_init + 1` and 
   `max_r_init + 2` (or fewer if near the bottom edge) from the `output_grid`.
5. Tile the pattern: For rows `r_target` starting from `max_r_init + 3` down 
   to the bottom, copy the corresponding row from the pattern block based on 
   `(r_target - (max_r_init + 1)) % pattern_height`.
6. Return the modified `output_grid`.

**General Assessment:**

The previous code attempted a solution based on observing a 2-row repeating pattern derived from the initial propagation in the first example. However, analyzing the results on both examples reveals this assumption was incorrect. The errors in both Example 1 and Example 2 occur in the third row generated (index `max_r_init + 2`), specifically where the code starts tiling the presumed 2-row pattern instead of continuing the propagation rule.

The core diagonal propagation logic seems mostly correct, but it needs to be applied continuously downwards for all rows below the initial colored pixels, not just for two rows followed by tiling. The pattern observed is an emergent property of the repeated application of the propagation rule, not a fixed block to be tiled.

**Strategy:**

The strategy is to revise the natural language program and subsequent code to:
1.  Identify the last row with non-white pixels.
2.  Iteratively apply the diagonal propagation rule for *every* row below this initial row, down to the bottom of the grid.
3.  Remove the logic related to identifying and tiling a 2-row pattern.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid, `output_grid`.
2.  Find the row index `max_r_init` such that `input_grid[max_r_init]` contains at least one non-white pixel, and all rows below `max_r_init` contain only white pixels. If no non-white pixels exist in the input grid, return the original `output_grid`.
3.  Iterate through each row `r` from `max_r_init + 1` to the last row of the grid (`height - 1`).
4.  Within each row `r`, iterate through each column `c` from `0` to the last column (`width - 1`).
5.  For the current cell `(r, c)`, look at the colors of the two cells diagonally above it in the *previous* row (`r-1`): the up-left cell `(r-1, c-1)` and the up-right cell `(r-1, c+1)`.
6.  Retrieve the colors `color_ul` and `color_ur` from `output_grid[r-1, c-1]` and `output_grid[r-1, c+1]`, respectively. If `c-1` is less than 0, `color_ul` is white (0). If `c+1` is greater than or equal to `width`, `color_ur` is white (0).
7.  Apply the propagation rule to determine the color for `output_grid[r, c]`:
    *   If `color_ul` is non-white and `color_ur` is white, set `output_grid[r, c]` to `color_ul`.
    *   If `color_ul` is white and `color_ur` is non-white, set `output_grid[r, c]` to `color_ur`.
    *   If `color_ul` is non-white and `color_ur` is non-white, AND `color_ul` is the same as `color_ur`, set `output_grid[r, c]` to `color_ul`.
    *   In all other cases (both `color_ul` and `color_ur` are white, or they are different non-white colors), `output_grid[r, c]` remains its current value (which should be white, assuming the input grid below `max_r_init` is white).
8.  After iterating through all rows `r` and columns `c` below `max_r_init`, return the final `output_grid`.
