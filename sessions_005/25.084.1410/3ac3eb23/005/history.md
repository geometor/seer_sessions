```python
"""
Simulates a downward diagonal cascade propagation process on a grid.

The transformation proceeds row by row, starting from the second row (index 1).
For each cell in the current row, its final color is determined based on the 
colors of the two cells diagonally above it (up-left and up-right) in the 
*previous* row's state.

1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Iterate through rows `r` from 1 to `height - 1`.
3. Iterate through columns `c` from 0 to `width - 1`.
4. For the current cell `(r, c)` in the output grid:
   a. Only consider changing the cell if it is currently white (0). If it's 
      already colored from the input, skip it.
   b. Get the color `color_ul` from the cell diagonally up-left `(r-1, c-1)`. 
      Treat out-of-bounds positions as white (0).
   c. Get the color `color_ur` from the cell diagonally up-right `(r-1, c+1)`. 
      Treat out-of-bounds positions as white (0).
   d. Determine the color for `output_grid[r, c]`:
      - If only one of `color_ul` or `color_ur` is non-white, set 
        `output_grid[r, c]` to that non-white color.
      - If both `color_ul` and `color_ur` are non-white and they are the 
        *same* color, set `output_grid[r, c]` to that color.
      - If both `color_ul` and `color_ur` are white, or if they are non-white 
        but *different* colors, `output_grid[r, c]` remains white (0).
5. Return the final output grid.

**Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code successfully implemented the core diagonal propagation mechanic observed in the first example. However, testing against further examples revealed that this propagation doesn't continue indefinitely down the grid. Instead, a pattern emerges after the initial propagation, and this pattern repeats vertically to fill the remaining space.

The errors in the previous outputs (`Transformed Output` vs. `Expected Output`) consistently show the propagation continuing beyond where the repeating pattern should take over.

**Strategy:**

1.  Refine the understanding of *when* the propagation stops and the repetition begins.
2.  Identify the rows that form the repeating pattern block. Based on the examples, this block appears directly below the initial colored pixels and seems to be 2 rows high.
3.  Modify the process:
    *   Perform the initial diagonal propagation for a limited number of rows (just enough to establish the repeating block, likely 2 rows below the initial stimulus).
    *   Extract this newly generated 2-row block.
    *   Tile this block vertically downwards to fill the rest of the grid.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Simulates a downward diagonal color propagation process that settles into a repeating vertical pattern.
grid_properties:
  - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - Background color is white (0).
initial_state:
  - Non-white pixels (colored sources) are present in the input grid, typically concentrated in the top rows (observed only in the first row so far).
transformation_steps:
  - propagation:
      - description: Colors propagate diagonally downwards (one step down, one step left/right) row by row.
      - source: The state of the previous row determines the colors in the current row.
      - rule: A white pixel at (r, c) becomes colored if:
          - Exactly one of the pixels at (r-1, c-1) and (r-1, c+1) is colored. The pixel (r, c) takes that color.
          - Both pixels at (r-1, c-1) and (r-1, c+1) are colored *and* have the same color. The pixel (r, c) takes that color.
      - boundary_conditions: Pixels outside the grid boundaries are treated as white (0).
      - interaction: If the two diagonal source pixels have different non-white colors, the target pixel remains white.
      - duration: This propagation occurs for a limited number of rows, specifically the two rows immediately following the last row containing initial colored sources.
  - pattern_identification:
      - description: The two rows generated by the initial propagation form a repeating pattern block.
      - location: These are rows `max_r_init + 1` and `max_r_init + 2`, where `max_r_init` is the index of the last row with initial colors.
  - pattern_tiling:
      - description: The identified 2-row pattern block is copied vertically downwards to fill the remaining rows of the grid.
      - starting_row: Tiling begins at row `max_r_init + 3`.
      - mechanism: For each subsequent row `r_target`, the content is copied from the corresponding row within the pattern block, determined by `(r_target - (max_r_init + 1)) % 2`.
output_grid:
  - Contains the initial colored sources from the input.
  - Contains the results of the initial limited propagation.
  - Contains the repeated pattern block filling the remaining lower rows.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find the maximum row index (`max_r_init`) that contains any non-white pixel in the *input* grid. If the grid is entirely white, return the copied grid.
3.  Simulate the diagonal propagation for the two rows immediately following `max_r_init`. Iterate `r` from `max_r_init + 1` up to `min(height, max_r_init + 3)`:
    *   For each column `c` from 0 to `width - 1`:
        *   If the cell `output_grid[r, c]` is currently white (0):
            *   Get the colors `color_ul` from `output_grid[r-1, c-1]` and `color_ur` from `output_grid[r-1, c+1]`, treating out-of-bounds positions as white (0).
            *   If `color_ul` is non-white and `color_ur` is white, set `output_grid[r, c]` to `color_ul`.
            *   If `color_ul` is white and `color_ur` is non-white, set `output_grid[r, c]` to `color_ur`.
            *   If `color_ul` and `color_ur` are non-white and `color_ul == color_ur`, set `output_grid[r, c]` to `color_ul`.
            *   Otherwise, leave `output_grid[r, c]` as white (0).
4.  Identify the 2-row pattern block: Extract rows `max_r_init + 1` and `max_r_init + 2` from the `output_grid` (if they exist within the grid boundaries). Let this be `pattern_block`.
5.  Fill the remaining rows below the pattern block by repeating it. Iterate `r_target` from `max_r_init + 3` to `height - 1`:
    *   Calculate the index within the pattern block: `source_row_index = (r_target - (max_r_init + 1)) % 2`.
    *   Copy the row `pattern_block[source_row_index, :]` to `output_grid[r_target, :]`.
6.  Return the `output_grid`.
