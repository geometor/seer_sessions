"""
Simulates a downward diagonal color propagation process for two rows below the
last initial colored row, identifies this 2-row section as a repeating pattern, 
and tiles this pattern vertically downwards to fill the remaining grid space.

1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Find the index of the last row (`max_r_init`) containing any non-white 
   pixels in the input grid. If none exist, return the copy.
3. Simulate diagonal propagation for the two rows immediately below `max_r_init`. 
   For `r` from `max_r_init + 1` up to `min(height, max_r_init + 3)`:
   - For each column `c`:
     - If `output_grid[r, c]` is white (0):
       - Get colors `color_ul` from `output_grid[r-1, c-1]` and `color_ur` 
         from `output_grid[r-1, c+1]` (treat out-of-bounds as white).
       - Apply rules: If one source is colored, use that color. If both are 
         the same color, use that color. Otherwise, remain white.
4. Identify the pattern block: Extract rows `max_r_init + 1` and 
   `max_r_init + 2` (or fewer if near the bottom edge) from the `output_grid`.
5. Tile the pattern: For rows `r_target` starting from `max_r_init + 3` down 
   to the bottom, copy the corresponding row from the pattern block based on 
   `(r_target - (max_r_init + 1)) % pattern_height`.
6. Return the modified `output_grid`.
