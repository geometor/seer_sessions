Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2. Iterate through rows `r` from 1 to `height - 1`.\n3. Iterate through columns `c` from 0 to `width - 1`.\n4. For the current cell `(r, c)` in the output grid:\n   a. Only consider changing the cell if it is currently white (0). If it's \n      already colored from the input, skip it.\n   b. Get the color `color_ul` from the cell diagonally up-left `(r-1, c-1)`. \n      Treat out-of-bounds positions as white (0).\n   c. Get the color `color_ur` from the cell diagonally up-right `(r-1, c+1)`. \n      Treat out-of-bounds positions as white (0).\n   d. Determine the color for `output_grid[r, c]`:\n      - If only one of `color_ul` or `color_ur` is non-white, set \n        `output_grid[r, c]` to that non-white color.\n      - If both `color_ul` and `color_ur` are non-white and they are the \n        *same* color, set `output_grid[r, c]` to that color.\n      - If both `color_ul` and `color_ur` are white, or if they are non-white \n        but *different* colors, `output_grid[r, c]` remains white (0).\n5.
