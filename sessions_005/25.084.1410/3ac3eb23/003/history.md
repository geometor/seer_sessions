Propagate colored pixels downwards in a cascading pattern.

1. Create a copy of the input grid; this will be the working output grid.
2. Iterate through each row of the working grid, from the top row (row index 0) 
   down to the second-to-last row (row index height - 2). Let the current 
   row index be r.
3. Within each row r, iterate through each column (column index c) from left 
   to right (index 0 to width - 1).
4. Examine the pixel at position (r, c) in the working grid. Let its color 
   be current_color.
5. If current_color is not white (0):
   a. Consider the target position (r + 1, c - 1) (down-left).
      i. Check if this position is within the grid boundaries.
      ii. If it is within bounds, check the color of the pixel at 
          (r + 1, c - 1) in the working grid.
      iii. If the color at (r + 1, c - 1) is white (0), change its color 
           to current_color.
   b. Consider the target position (r + 1, c + 1) (down-right).
      i. Check if this position is within the grid boundaries.
      ii. If it is within bounds, check the color of the pixel at 
          (r + 1, c + 1) in the working grid.
      iii. If the color at (r + 1, c + 1) is white (0), change its color 
           to current_color.
6. After iterating through all relevant rows and columns, the working grid 
   contains the final output. Return this grid.

Okay, the metric gathering confirms the number of pixel differences reported previously. My manual count for Example 2 colors was slightly off, the code confirms the counts. The coordinate differences highlight where the cascade went wrong - primarily in the areas where two cascades might interact or where propagation continued from newly generated pixels.

My revised rule hypothesis seems plausible and addresses the observed discrepancies. It processes row by row, depends only on the previous row's state, and handles the case where two different colors could influence the same cell by leaving it white.## General Assessment

The previous code attempted a "downward cascade" transformation. However, it incorrectly allowed newly colored pixels within the same transformation step to become sources for further propagation downwards. This resulted in cascades that were too wide and, in cases with multiple initial colors (Example 2), led to incorrect interactions or overwriting where cascades met.

The expected behavior appears to be a turn-based or row-by-row simulation where the state of a row `r` depends *only* on the state of the *previous* row `r-1`. Furthermore, when a cell has potential sources of different colors diagonally above it, it should remain uncolored (white).

**Strategy:** The natural language program and subsequent code need to be updated to reflect this row-by-row dependency. The core logic will involve iterating from the second row downwards. For each cell, it will look at the two cells diagonally above it in the *already computed* previous row of the output grid. Based on the colors found (handling boundary conditions and conflicts), it will determine the color of the current cell.

## Metrics

**Example 1:**

*   Input Size: 6x7
*   Output Size: 6x7
*   Colors: Yellow (4), White (0)
*   Expected Output: 16 Yellow pixels, 26 White pixels.
*   Transformed Output (Previous Code): 22 Yellow pixels, 20 White pixels.
*   Pixel Differences: 6 incorrect pixels. The incorrect pixels are all Yellow, appearing where the cascade incorrectly broadened due to propagation from newly created pixels.
    *   Coordinates (row, col): (2,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,5), (5,4), (5,6)

**Example 2:**

*   Input Size: 6x10
*   Output Size: 6x10
*   Colors: Red (2), Azure (8), White (0)
*   Expected Output: 9 Red pixels, 9 Azure pixels, 42 White pixels.
*   Transformed Output (Previous Code): 15 Red pixels, 10 Azure pixels, 35 White pixels.
*   Pixel Differences: 11 incorrect pixels. Errors occur where the Red and Azure cascades should have remained separate but interacted incorrectly, and also where cascades broadened incorrectly.
    *   Coordinates (row, col): (2,3), (2,7), (3,4), (3,8), (4,3), (4,5), (4,7), (4,9), (5,4), (5,6), (5,8)

## Facts


```yaml
- task: Downward diagonal cascade simulation.
- grid_properties:
    - dimensions: Height and width vary between examples.
    - background_color: White (0).
- objects:
    - type: Colored pixels (non-white).
    - behavior: Act as initial sources for a cascading effect.
- actions:
    - process: Simulation proceeds row by row, from top to bottom.
    - rule: A cell at `(r, c)` potentially receives color based on cells `(r-1, c-1)` and `(r-1, c+1)`.
    - propagation:
        - A white cell at `(r, c)` becomes colored if exactly one of the diagonal cells above it (`(r-1, c-1)` or `(r-1, c+1)`) in the previous row is non-white. The cell `(r, c)` takes the color of that non-white source cell.
        - If both diagonal cells above (`(r-1, c-1)` and `(r-1, c+1)`) are non-white:
            - If they have the *same* color, the cell `(r, c)` takes that color.
            - If they have *different* colors, the cell `(r, c)` remains white.
        - Cells outside the grid boundaries are treated as white (0).
    - state_dependency: The calculation for row `r` depends *only* on the state of row `r-1`.
    - initialization: The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid. The simulation effectively starts computing from row 1 based on row 0.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create the `output_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Get the `height` and `width` of the grid.
3.  Iterate through the grid rows (`r`) starting from row 1 up to `height - 1`.
4.  Inside the row loop, iterate through the grid columns (`c`) from 0 up to `width - 1`.
5.  For the current cell `(r, c)`:
    a.  Check if the cell `output_grid[r, c]` is currently white (0). If it's not white, skip to the next column (this cell is already colored, likely from the initial input).
    b.  Determine the color of the potential source cell diagonally up-left: `(r-1, c-1)`.
        i.  If `c-1` is less than 0 (out of bounds), treat the color `color_ul` as white (0).
        ii. Otherwise, get the color from `output_grid[r-1, c-1]`. Let this be `color_ul`.
    c.  Determine the color of the potential source cell diagonally up-right: `(r-1, c+1)`.
        i.  If `c+1` is greater than or equal to `width` (out of bounds), treat the color `color_ur` as white (0).
        ii. Otherwise, get the color from `output_grid[r-1, c+1]`. Let this be `color_ur`.
    d.  Apply the coloring rule based on `color_ul` and `color_ur`:
        i.  If `color_ul` is non-white and `color_ur` is white, set `output_grid[r, c] = color_ul`.
        ii. Else if `color_ul` is white and `color_ur` is non-white, set `output_grid[r, c] = color_ur`.
        iii. Else if `color_ul` is non-white and `color_ur` is non-white:
            - If `color_ul == color_ur`, set `output_grid[r, c] = color_ul`.
            - (Otherwise, if `color_ul != color_ur`, the cell remains white).
        iv. (Otherwise, if both `color_ul` and `color_ur` are white, the cell remains white).
6.  After iterating through all rows and columns, return the `output_grid`.
