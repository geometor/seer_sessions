task_description: Simulates a downward diagonal color propagation process that settles into a repeating vertical pattern.
grid_properties:
  - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - Background color is white (0).
initial_state:
  - Non-white pixels (colored sources) are present in the input grid, typically concentrated in the top rows (observed only in the first row so far).
transformation_steps:
  - propagation:
      - description: Colors propagate diagonally downwards (one step down, one step left/right) row by row.
      - source: The state of the previous row determines the colors in the current row.
      - rule: A white pixel at (r, c) becomes colored if:
          - Exactly one of the pixels at (r-1, c-1) and (r-1, c+1) is colored. The pixel (r, c) takes that color.
          - Both pixels at (r-1, c-1) and (r-1, c+1) are colored *and* have the same color. The pixel (r, c) takes that color.
      - boundary_conditions: Pixels outside the grid boundaries are treated as white (0).
      - interaction: If the two diagonal source pixels have different non-white colors, the target pixel remains white.
      - duration: This propagation occurs for a limited number of rows, specifically the two rows immediately following the last row containing initial colored sources.
  - pattern_identification:
      - description: The two rows generated by the initial propagation form a repeating pattern block.
      - location: These are rows `max_r_init + 1` and `max_r_init + 2`, where `max_r_init` is the index of the last row with initial colors.
  - pattern_tiling:
      - description: The identified 2-row pattern block is copied vertically downwards to fill the remaining rows of the grid.
      - starting_row: Tiling begins at row `max_r_init + 3`.
      - mechanism: For each subsequent row `r_target`, the content is copied from the corresponding row within the pattern block, determined by `(r_target - (max_r_init + 1)) % 2`.
output_grid:
  - Contains the initial colored sources from the input.
  - Contains the results of the initial limited propagation.
  - Contains the repeated pattern block filling the remaining lower rows.
