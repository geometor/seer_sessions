            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code successfully implemented the core diagonal propagation mechanic observed in the first example. However, testing against further examples revealed that this propagation doesn't continue indefinitely down the grid. Instead, a pattern emerges after the initial propagation, and this pattern repeats vertically to fill the remaining space.\n\nThe errors in the previous outputs (`Transformed Output` vs. `Expected Output`) consistently show the propagation continuing beyond where the repeating pattern should take over.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Refine the understanding of *when* the propagation stops and the repetition begins.\n2.  Identify the rows that form the repeating pattern block. Based on the examples, this block appears directly below the initial colored pixels and seems to be 2 rows high.\n3.  Modify the process:\n    *   Perform the initial diagonal propagation for a limited number of rows (just enough to establish the repeating block, likely 2 rows below the initial stimulus).\n    *   Extract this newly generated 2-row block.\n    *   Tile this block vertically downwards to fill the rest of the grid.\n\n**Metrics**\n"
