            "text": "Okay, the metric gathering confirms the number of pixel differences reported previously. My manual count for Example 2 colors was slightly off, the code confirms the counts. The coordinate differences highlight where the cascade went wrong - primarily in the areas where two cascades might interact or where propagation continued from newly generated pixels.\n\nMy revised rule hypothesis seems plausible and addresses the observed discrepancies. It processes row by row, depends only on the previous row's state, and handles the case where two different colors could influence the same cell by leaving it white.## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempted a \"downward cascade\" transformation. However, it incorrectly allowed newly colored pixels within the same transformation step to become sources for further propagation downwards. This resulted in cascades that were too wide and, in cases with multiple initial colors (Example 2), led to incorrect interactions or overwriting where cascades met.\n\nThe expected behavior appears to be a turn-based or row-by-row simulation where the state of a row `r` depends *only* on the state of the *previous* row `r-1`. Furthermore, when a cell has potential sources of different colors diagonally above it, it should remain uncolored (white).\n\n**Strategy:** The natural language program and subsequent code need to be updated to reflect this row-by-row dependency. The core logic will involve iterating from the second row downwards. For each cell, it will look at the two cells diagonally above it in the *already computed* previous row of the output grid. Based on the colors found (handling boundary conditions and conflicts), it will determine the color of the current cell.\n\n## Metrics\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   Input Size: 6x7\n*   Output Size: 6x7\n*   Colors: Yellow (4), White (0)\n*   Expected Output: 16 Yellow pixels, 26 White pixels.\n*   Transformed Output (Previous Code): 22 Yellow pixels, 20 White pixels.\n*   Pixel Differences: 6 incorrect pixels. The incorrect pixels are all Yellow, appearing where the cascade incorrectly broadened due to propagation from newly created pixels.\n    *   Coordinates (row, col): (2,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,5), (5,4), (5,6)\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   Input Size: 6x10\n*   Output Size: 6x10\n*   Colors: Red (2), Azure (8), White (0)\n*   Expected Output: 9 Red pixels, 9 Azure pixels, 42 White pixels.\n*   Transformed Output (Previous Code): 15 Red pixels, 10 Azure pixels, 35 White pixels.\n*   Pixel Differences: 11 incorrect pixels. Errors occur where the Red and Azure cascades should have remained separate but interacted incorrectly, and also where cascades broadened incorrectly.\n    *   Coordinates (row, col): (2,3), (2,7), (3,4), (3,8), (4,3), (4,5), (4,7), (4,9), (5,4), (5,6), (5,8)\n\n## Facts\n\n"
