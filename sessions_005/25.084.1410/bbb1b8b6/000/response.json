This gray column acts as a separator.\n    *   The grid to the left of the separator seems to be the base or canvas for the output.\n    *   The grid to the right of the separator seems to define a pattern or color information.\n    *   The output grid always has the same dimensions as the left part of the input grid.\n    *   The transformation involves potentially modifying the left part based on information from the right part.\n    *   A key factor determining the transformation is whether the non-white pixels on the left side spatially overlap with the non-white pixels on the right side (ignoring the gray separator).\n    *   If there is *no* overlap between the non-white pixels of the left and right parts, then the white pixels (color 0) on the left part are replaced by the non-white color found on the right part, but *only* at positions where the right part has that non-white color.\n    *   If there *is* an overlap between the non-white pixels of the left and right parts, then the left part is copied directly to the output without modification.\n    *   In all examples, there appears to be only one significant non-white color on the left (blue, 1) and one significant non-white color on the right (varying colors like magenta, red, orange, green).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
