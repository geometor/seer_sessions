*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grid is consistently divided into two main parts by a single vertical column of gray pixels (color 5). This gray column acts as a separator.
    *   The grid to the left of the separator seems to be the base or canvas for the output.
    *   The grid to the right of the separator seems to define a pattern or color information.
    *   The output grid always has the same dimensions as the left part of the input grid.
    *   The transformation involves potentially modifying the left part based on information from the right part.
    *   A key factor determining the transformation is whether the non-white pixels on the left side spatially overlap with the non-white pixels on the right side (ignoring the gray separator).
    *   If there is *no* overlap between the non-white pixels of the left and right parts, then the white pixels (color 0) on the left part are replaced by the non-white color found on the right part, but *only* at positions where the right part has that non-white color.
    *   If there *is* an overlap between the non-white pixels of the left and right parts, then the left part is copied directly to the output without modification.
    *   In all examples, there appears to be only one significant non-white color on the left (blue, 1) and one significant non-white color on the right (varying colors like magenta, red, orange, green).

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the vertical column consisting entirely of gray (5) pixels. This is the separator.
    2.  Extract the portion of the input grid to the left of the separator (the "left grid").
    3.  Extract the portion of the input grid to the right of the separator (the "right grid").
    4.  Find the single non-white color present in the left grid (let's call it `Color_L`). If no non-white color exists, or multiple exist, this rule may need refinement, but assume one for now.
    5.  Find the single non-white color present in the right grid (let's call it `Color_R`). If no non-white color exists, or multiple exist, assume one for now.
    6.  Check if there is any position `(row, col)` where the pixel at `left_grid[row, col]` is `Color_L` AND the pixel at `right_grid[row, col]` is `Color_R`. Set a flag `overlap_found` to true if such a position exists, otherwise set it to false.
    7.  If `overlap_found` is true, the output grid is an exact copy of the left grid.
    8.  If `overlap_found` is false:
        a.  Create the initial output grid as an exact copy of the left grid.
        b.  Iterate through each pixel position `(row, col)` in the output grid.
        c.  If the pixel `output_grid[row, col]` is white (0) AND the corresponding pixel `right_grid[row, col]` is `Color_R`, then change the pixel `output_grid[row, col]` to `Color_R`.
        d.  Otherwise, leave the `output_grid[row, col]` pixel unchanged.
    9.  Return the final output grid.
