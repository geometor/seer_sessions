Identify the vertical column consisting entirely of gray (5) pixels. This acts as a separator.\n2.  Split the input grid into two subgrids based on this separator: the \"left grid\" (left of the separator) and the \"right grid\" (right of the separator).\n3.  Find the single primary non-white color in the left grid (Color_L) and the single primary non-white color in the right grid (Color_R). Assume white (0) is the background and there's only one other significant color on each side for the core logic.\n4.  Check for spatial overlap: Determine if there exists any coordinate (row, col) such that the pixel at `left_grid[row, col]` is Color_L AND the pixel at `right_grid[row, col]` is Color_R.\n5.  Conditional Output Generation:\n    a.  If an overlap is found (step 4 is true), the output grid is an exact copy of the left grid.\n    b.  If no overlap is found (step 4 is false), create the output grid by starting with a copy of the left grid. Then, for every pixel position (row, col), if the pixel in the output grid is currently white (0) AND the corresponding pixel `right_grid[row, col]` is Color_R, update the output grid pixel at (row, col) to Color_R.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_separator_column(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds the index of the first column composed entirely of gray (5) pixels.\"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    for c in range(width):\n        is_separator = True\n        for r in range(height):\n            if grid[r, c] != 5:\n                is_separator = False\n                break\n        if is_separator:\n            return c\n    return -1 # Return -1 if no separator column is found\n\ndef find_primary_non_white_color(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds the most frequent non-white color in the grid.\n       Returns None if only white (0) is present or grid is empty.\"\"\"\n    if grid.size == 0:\n        return None\n        \n    unique_colors, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)\n    color_counts = dict(zip(unique_colors, counts))\n\n    # Remove white color (0) if present\n    if 0 in color_counts:\n        del color_counts[0]\n\n    if not color_counts: # No non-white colors\n        return None\n    \n    # Return the most frequent non-white color\n    # If ties, it returns one of the most frequent ones.
