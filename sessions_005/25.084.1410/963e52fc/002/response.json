This indicates the transformation is more complex than simple duplication.\n\n*   **Example 1 Failure:** The right half of the output grid is not a direct copy of the input grid. The colors in the non-background row seem transformed based on a pattern or rule.\n*   **Example 3 Failure:** The right half of the output grid is also not a direct copy. It appears related to the input grid, but with some rows potentially swapped or modified compared to a simple duplication.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Examine the relationship between the input grid and the *right half* of the expected output grid for the failing examples (1 and 3).\n2.  Compare this relationship with the successful case (Example 2) to find a consistent rule.\n3.  Identify the conditions under which simple duplication occurs versus the more complex transformations seen in Examples 1 and 3.\n4.  Hypothesize a rule involving properties like the number of unique non-background rows or specific color patterns.\n5.  Use code execution to gather precise metrics about the rows and colors involved.\n\n**Gather Metrics**\n"
