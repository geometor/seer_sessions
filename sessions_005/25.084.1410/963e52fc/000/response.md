**Perception:**

Each example shows an input grid and a corresponding output grid. I observe that the output grid always has the same height as the input grid, but the width of the output grid is exactly twice the width of the input grid. Comparing the content, the left half of the output grid is identical to the entire input grid. Furthermore, the right half of the output grid is also identical to the input grid. It appears the transformation involves duplicating the input grid horizontally.

**Facts:**


```yaml
- task: Horizontal Tiling
  examples:
    - id: train_1
      input_grid:
        height: 5
        width: 7
        pixels: [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [2,3,3,2,3,3,2], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
      output_grid:
        height: 5
        width: 14
        left_half: Identical to input_grid
        right_half: Identical to input_grid
    - id: train_2
      input_grid:
        height: 5
        width: 6
        pixels: [[0,0,0,0,0,0], [2,8,2,8,2,8], [2,8,2,8,2,8], [0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0]]
      output_grid:
        height: 5
        width: 12
        left_half: Identical to input_grid
        right_half: Identical to input_grid
    - id: train_3
      input_grid:
        height: 5
        width: 8
        pixels: [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [1,2,2,1,2,2,1,2], [2,1,2,2,1,2,2,1], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
      output_grid:
        height: 5
        width: 16
        left_half: Identical to input_grid
        right_half: Identical to input_grid
  transformation:
    input_object: The entire input grid.
    action: Horizontal concatenation.
    result: Create a new grid with the same height and double the width of the input grid.
    relationship: The new grid is formed by placing the input grid next to a copy of itself. The left part (columns 0 to width-1) is the original input, and the right part (columns width to 2*width-1) is a copy of the original input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with height H and width 2 * W.
3.  Copy the entire input grid into the left half of the output grid (from column 0 to W-1).
4.  Copy the entire input grid again into the right half of the output grid (from column W to 2*W-1).
