    represented_as: Objects
  - property: Each non-white color forms a contiguous object.
  - property: The background color is white (0).
  - relationship: The two non-white colors have different numerical indices (color values).
  - action: Identify the two distinct non-white color indices present in the input grid.
  - action: Compare the numerical values of these two color indices.
  - outcome: Select the color index with the larger numerical value.
  - output_structure: The output is a 2x2 grid.
  - output_content: The output grid is filled entirely with the selected color (the one with the larger numerical index).
