            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\nEach input grid contains a white background (color 0) and two distinct objects, each made of a single, different non-white color. These objects are contiguous blocks of pixels. The shape of these objects sometimes resembles numerical digits corresponding to their color index (e.g., color 6 looks like a '6', color 7 like a '7', color 8 like an '8', color 4 like a '4', color 2 like a '2'), but this might just be a coincidence or a visual aid in the examples. The key feature seems to be the presence of exactly two different non-white colors.\n\nThe output grid is always a small, solid 2x2 square filled with a single color. This color corresponds to one of the two non-white colors present in the input grid.\n\nBy comparing the input and output across the examples, the determining factor for the output color appears to be the numerical value associated with the colors of the two input objects. The output color is always the color with the *higher* numerical index among the two non-white colors present in the input.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
