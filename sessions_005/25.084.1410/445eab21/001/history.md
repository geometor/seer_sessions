Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

**Perception:**

Each input grid contains a white background (color 0) and two distinct objects, each made of a single, different non-white color. These objects are contiguous blocks of pixels. The shape of these objects sometimes resembles numerical digits corresponding to their color index (e.g., color 6 looks like a '6', color 7 like a '7', color 8 like an '8', color 4 like a '4', color 2 like a '2'), but this might just be a coincidence or a visual aid in the examples. The key feature seems to be the presence of exactly two different non-white colors.

The output grid is always a small, solid 2x2 square filled with a single color. This color corresponds to one of the two non-white colors present in the input grid.

By comparing the input and output across the examples, the determining factor for the output color appears to be the numerical value associated with the colors of the two input objects. The output color is always the color with the *higher* numerical index among the two non-white colors present in the input.

**Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - description: Each input grid contains exactly two distinct non-white colors.
    represented_as: Objects
  - property: Each non-white color forms a contiguous object.
  - property: The background color is white (0).
  - relationship: The two non-white colors have different numerical indices (color values).
  - action: Identify the two distinct non-white color indices present in the input grid.
  - action: Compare the numerical values of these two color indices.
  - outcome: Select the color index with the larger numerical value.
  - output_structure: The output is a 2x2 grid.
  - output_content: The output grid is filled entirely with the selected color (the one with the larger numerical index).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid to identify all unique non-white color values present.
2.  Determine the two distinct non-white color values (let's call them color A and color B).
3.  Compare the numerical value of color A and color B.
4.  Identify the color with the greater numerical value.
5.  Construct a 2x2 output grid.
6.  Fill every cell of the 2x2 output grid with the color identified in step 4.
