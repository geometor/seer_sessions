Input:
  grid_properties:
    height: 12 (consistently even)
    width: 4
    colors_present: [white (0), green (3), gray (5)]
  structure:
    - top_half: Rows 0 to height/2 - 1. Contains green (3) and white (0) patterns.
    - bottom_half: Rows height/2 to height - 1. Contains gray (5) and white (0) patterns.

Output:
  grid_properties:
    height: Input height / 2 (e.g., 6)
    width: Input width (e.g., 4)
    colors_present: [white (0), yellow (4)]

Transformation:
  type: Overlay / Combination
  mapping:
    - rule: An output cell at (row, col) becomes yellow (4) if the input cell at (row, col) is green (3) OR the input cell at (row + input_height/2, col) is gray (5).
    - otherwise: The output cell at (row, col) becomes white (0).
  dimensionality_change: Output height is half the input height. Width remains the same.
