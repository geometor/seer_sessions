            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the task examples and provide the requested deliverables.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grids are consistently 6 rows by 5 columns. The output grids are consistently 3 rows by 5 columns. This indicates a transformation that reduces the height by half while preserving the width.\n2.  **Color Palette:**\n    *   Input grids use white (0), maroon (9), and yellow (4).\n    *   Output grids use white (0) and magenta (6).\n3.  **Spatial Patterning:**\n    *   In the input grids, maroon (9) pixels appear only in the top 3 rows.\n    *   Yellow (4) pixels appear only in the bottom 3 rows.\n    *   White (0) pixels appear throughout the input grids.\n    *   The output grid's magenta (6) pixels seem to depend on the locations of maroon (9) and yellow (4) in the input.\n4.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation appears to involve comparing the top half of the input grid with the bottom half on a cell-by-cell basis.\n    *   The output grid has the dimensions of one half (3x5).\n    *   Let's denote a cell in the top half as `Input[r][c]` and the corresponding cell in the bottom half as `Input[r+3][c]`, where `r` is the row index (0 to 2) and `c` is the column index (0 to 4).\n    *   The output cell `Output[r][c]` seems determined by the colors at `Input[r][c]` and `Input[r+3][c]`.\n    *   Observing the examples:\n        *   If `Input[r][c]` is non-white (maroon 9) and `Input[r+3][c]` is white (0), then `Output[r][c]` is magenta (6).\n        *   If `Input[r][c]` is white (0) and `Input[r+3][c]` is non-white (yellow 4), then `Output[r][c]` is magenta (6).\n        *   If both `Input[r][c]` and `Input[r+3][c]` are white (0), then `Output[r][c]` is white (0).\n        *   If `Input[r][c]` is non-white (maroon 9) and `Input[r+3][c]` is non-white (yellow 4), then `Output[r][c]` is white (0).\n    *   This logic resembles an XOR operation: the output pixel is magenta (6) if *exactly one* of the corresponding input pixels (one from the top half, one from the bottom half) is non-white. Otherwise, the output pixel is white (0).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
