"""
Transforms an input grid by overlaying its top and bottom halves and applying an XOR-like logic.

1. Divide the input grid horizontally into two equal halves: the top half (first `height/2` rows) and the bottom half (last `height/2` rows).
2. Create a new output grid with the dimensions of one half (height `height/2`, width same as input).
3. Iterate through each cell position (`r`, `c`) in the output grid.
4. For the current position (`r`, `c`):
    a. Get the color of the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the top half of the input grid (`top_color`).
    b. Get the color of the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the bottom half of the input grid (`bottom_color`).
    c. Determine if `top_color` is non-white (not 0).
    d. Determine if `bottom_color` is non-white (not 0).
    e. If exactly one of `top_color` or `bottom_color` is non-white, set the output pixel at (`r`, `c`) to magenta (6).
    f. Otherwise (if both are white or both are non-white), set the output pixel at (`r`, `c`) to white (0).
5. Return the completed output grid.
