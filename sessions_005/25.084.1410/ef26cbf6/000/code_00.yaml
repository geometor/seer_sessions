Objects:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - Contains pixels of different colors (0-9).
      - Size varies (up to 30x30).
  - type: Separator
    properties:
      - Composed of connected yellow (4) pixels.
      - Can form horizontal or vertical lines.
      - Divides the grid into distinct rectangular regions.
      - Remain unchanged in the transformation.
  - type: Region
    properties:
      - Rectangular areas of the grid bounded by yellow separators or grid edges.
      - Contain background pixels (white: 0).
      - May contain other colored pixels.
  - type: TargetPattern
    properties:
      - Located within a specific Region.
      - Composed of blue (1) pixels.
      - The shape/pixels that undergo transformation.
  - type: SourcePixel
    properties:
      - Located within a specific Region.
      - A single pixel of a color other than white(0), yellow(4), or blue(1).
      - Determines the output color for a corresponding TargetPattern.
      - Remains unchanged in its original position.

Relationships:
  - A Grid is partitioned into multiple Regions by Separators.
  - Some Regions contain TargetPatterns (blue pixels).
  - Some Regions contain exactly one SourcePixel (non-white/yellow/blue).
  - Each TargetPattern Region corresponds spatially to exactly one SourcePixel Region.
    - Correspondence is based on alignment within bands defined by the Separators:
      - If a primary vertical separator exists, pairing is horizontal within horizontal bands.
      - If a primary horizontal separator exists, pairing is vertical within vertical bands.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate yellow Separators and the Regions they define.
  - Categorize: Classify Regions based on content (containing TargetPatterns vs. containing a SourcePixel).
  - Map: Determine the correspondence between TargetPattern Regions and SourcePixel Regions based on spatial alignment relative to separators.
  - Extract: Get the color of the SourcePixel from each SourcePixel Region.
  - Replace: For each TargetPattern Region, change all blue (1) pixels within it to the color extracted from its corresponding SourcePixel Region.
  - Preserve: Keep all non-blue pixels (white, yellow, source colors) unchanged.
