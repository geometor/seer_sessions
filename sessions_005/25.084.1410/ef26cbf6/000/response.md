Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples feature grids divided into distinct rectangular regions by yellow (4) lines, which act as separators. These lines can be horizontal, vertical, or both.
2.  **Key Colors:**
    *   Yellow (4): Structural element, forming boundaries. Remains unchanged in the output.
    *   White (0): Background color. Remains unchanged.
    *   Blue (1): Appears in specific regions, often forming patterns. This is the color that gets transformed.
    *   Other colors (Orange, Green, Azure in `train_1`; Green, Red, Magenta in `train_2`): Appear as single pixels in specific regions. These act as "source" colors for the transformation. Remain unchanged in their original positions.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation involves changing the blue (1) pixels. The color they change *to* depends on the "source" color found in a corresponding region.
4.  **Region Correspondence:**
    *   The grid is partitioned by yellow lines.
    *   Some partitions contain patterns made only of blue (1) pixels (and white background). Let's call these "target regions".
    *   Other partitions contain a single non-white, non-yellow, non-blue pixel. Let's call these "source regions".
    *   There's a spatial relationship between target regions and source regions. In `train_1`, target regions on the right correspond to source regions on the left within the same horizontal band (defined by horizontal yellow lines). In `train_2`, target regions on the bottom correspond to source regions on the top within the same vertical band (defined by vertical yellow lines).
5.  **Rule:** All blue (1) pixels within a specific target region are replaced by the unique color found in its corresponding source region. All other pixels retain their original color.

## Facts


```yaml
Objects:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - Contains pixels of different colors (0-9).
      - Size varies (up to 30x30).
  - type: Separator
    properties:
      - Composed of connected yellow (4) pixels.
      - Can form horizontal or vertical lines.
      - Divides the grid into distinct rectangular regions.
      - Remain unchanged in the transformation.
  - type: Region
    properties:
      - Rectangular areas of the grid bounded by yellow separators or grid edges.
      - Contain background pixels (white: 0).
      - May contain other colored pixels.
  - type: TargetPattern
    properties:
      - Located within a specific Region.
      - Composed of blue (1) pixels.
      - The shape/pixels that undergo transformation.
  - type: SourcePixel
    properties:
      - Located within a specific Region.
      - A single pixel of a color other than white(0), yellow(4), or blue(1).
      - Determines the output color for a corresponding TargetPattern.
      - Remains unchanged in its original position.

Relationships:
  - A Grid is partitioned into multiple Regions by Separators.
  - Some Regions contain TargetPatterns (blue pixels).
  - Some Regions contain exactly one SourcePixel (non-white/yellow/blue).
  - Each TargetPattern Region corresponds spatially to exactly one SourcePixel Region.
    - Correspondence is based on alignment within bands defined by the Separators:
      - If a primary vertical separator exists, pairing is horizontal within horizontal bands.
      - If a primary horizontal separator exists, pairing is vertical within vertical bands.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate yellow Separators and the Regions they define.
  - Categorize: Classify Regions based on content (containing TargetPatterns vs. containing a SourcePixel).
  - Map: Determine the correspondence between TargetPattern Regions and SourcePixel Regions based on spatial alignment relative to separators.
  - Extract: Get the color of the SourcePixel from each SourcePixel Region.
  - Replace: For each TargetPattern Region, change all blue (1) pixels within it to the color extracted from its corresponding SourcePixel Region.
  - Preserve: Keep all non-blue pixels (white, yellow, source colors) unchanged.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Boundaries:** Locate all yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. These form horizontal and vertical lines that act as separators.
2.  **Define Regions:** Use the yellow separators and the grid edges to partition the grid into distinct rectangular regions.
3.  **Identify Source Regions and Colors:** Scan each region. If a region contains exactly one pixel whose color is *not* white (0), yellow (4), or blue (1), mark this region as a "source region" and record its unique color (the "source color").
4.  **Identify Target Regions:** Scan each region. If a region contains one or more blue (1) pixels and *no* source colors (as defined in step 3), mark this region as a "target region".
5.  **Establish Correspondence and Map Colors:** For each target region:
    a.  Determine its spatial relationship to the source regions based on the separator layout. Find the unique source region that aligns with it either horizontally within the same row-band (if separated primarily vertically) or vertically within the same column-band (if separated primarily horizontally).
    b.  Retrieve the source color associated with that corresponding source region.
    c.  Store this mapping (target region -> source color).
6.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.
7.  **Populate Output Grid:** Iterate through each pixel `(row, col)` of the input grid:
    a.  If the pixel `input[row][col]` is blue (1):
        i.  Determine which target region the pixel belongs to.
        ii. Look up the mapped source color for that target region.
        iii. Set `output[row][col]` to the mapped source color.
    b.  If the pixel `input[row][col]` is *not* blue (1):
        i.  Copy its color directly: `output[row][col] = input[row][col]`.
8.  **Return Output Grid:** The newly constructed grid is the result.
