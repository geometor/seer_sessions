            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples feature grids divided into distinct rectangular regions by yellow (4) lines, which act as separators. These lines can be horizontal, vertical, or both.\n2.  **Key Colors:**\n    *   Yellow (4): Structural element, forming boundaries. Remains unchanged in the output.\n    *   White (0): Background color. Remains unchanged.\n    *   Blue (1): Appears in specific regions, often forming patterns. This is the color that gets transformed.\n    *   Other colors (Orange, Green, Azure in `train_1`; Green, Red, Magenta in `train_2`): Appear as single pixels in specific regions. These act as \"source\" colors for the transformation. Remain unchanged in their original positions.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation involves changing the blue (1) pixels. The color they change *to* depends on the \"source\" color found in a corresponding region.\n4.  **Region Correspondence:**\n    *   The grid is partitioned by yellow lines.\n    *   Some partitions contain patterns made only of blue (1) pixels (and white background). Let's call these \"target regions\".\n    *   Other partitions contain a single non-white, non-yellow, non-blue pixel. Let's call these \"source regions\".\n    *   There's a spatial relationship between target regions and source regions. In `train_1`, target regions on the right correspond to source regions on the left within the same horizontal band (defined by horizontal yellow lines). In `train_2`, target regions on the bottom correspond to source regions on the top within the same vertical band (defined by vertical yellow lines).\n5.  **Rule:** All blue (1) pixels within a specific target region are replaced by the unique color found in its corresponding source region. All other pixels retain their original color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

These form horizontal and vertical lines that act as separators.\n2.  **Define Regions:** Use the yellow separators and the grid edges to partition the grid into distinct rectangular regions.\n3.  **Identify Source Regions and Colors:** Scan each region. If a region contains exactly one pixel whose color is *not* white (0), yellow (4), or blue (1), mark this region as a \"source region\" and record its unique color (the \"source color\").\n4.  **Identify Target Regions:** Scan each region. If a region contains one or more blue (1) pixels and *no* source colors (as defined in step 3), mark this region as a \"target region\".\n5.  **Establish Correspondence and Map Colors:** For each target region:\n    a.  Determine its spatial relationship to the source regions based on the separator layout. Find the unique source region that aligns with it either horizontally within the same row-band (if separated primarily vertically) or vertically within the same column-band (if separated primarily horizontally).\n    b.  Retrieve the source color associated with that corresponding source region.\n    c.  Store this mapping (target region -> source color).\n6.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.\n7.  **Populate Output Grid:** Iterate through each pixel `(row, col)` of the input grid:\n    a.  If the pixel `input[row][col]` is blue (1):\n        i.  Determine which target region the pixel belongs to.\n        ii. Look up the mapped source color for that target region.\n        iii. Set `output[row][col]` to the mapped source color.\n    b.  If the pixel `input[row][col]` is *not* blue (1):\n        i.  Copy its color directly: `output[row][col] = input[row][col]`.\n8.  **Return Output Grid:** The newly constructed grid is the result."
