elements:
  - object: input_grid
    attributes:
      - type: grid
      - contains: [initial_block, white_region]
  - object: initial_block
    attributes:
      - type: rectangle
      - location: top-left corner (column 0) of input_grid
      - colors: various non-white colors
      - width: W (variable across examples)
      - height: H (same as input_grid height)
  - object: white_region
    attributes:
      - type: rectangle
      - location: immediately right of initial_block in input_grid
      - color: white (0)
      - width: GridW - W (where GridW is input_grid width)
      - height: H
  - object: output_grid
    attributes:
      - type: grid
      - dimensions: same as input_grid
      - content: derived from input_grid

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    applies_to: input_grid
    results_in: output_grid
    rule:
      - step: Preserve the initial_block in the output_grid at the same location.
      - step: Fill the columns corresponding to the white_region in the output_grid.
      - detail: The filling uses columns from the initial_block.
      - rule_part_1:
          action: map_columns_reverse
          source: initial_block columns (from right-to-left: W-1, W-2, ..., 0)
          target: output_grid columns (from right-to-left: GridW-1, GridW-2, ..., GridW-W)
          condition: applies for the last W columns of the output grid.
      - rule_part_2:
          action: fill_columns
          source: initial_block column 0
          target: output_grid columns (from W to GridW-W-1)
          condition: applies to any columns between the preserved initial_block and the columns filled by rule_part_1.
