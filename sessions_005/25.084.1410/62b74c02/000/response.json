This block is immediately followed by a region filled entirely with the white color (0), extending to the right edge of the grid. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. The transformation involves filling the white region based on the columns of the initial colored block. The initial block itself is preserved in the output. The filling pattern works from right to left: the rightmost columns of the output replicate the columns of the initial block in reverse order (last column of block maps to last column of output, second-last maps to second-last, etc.). Once all columns of the initial block have been used in this reverse mapping, any remaining columns in the central part of the filled region are populated by replicating the *first* column of the initial block.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
