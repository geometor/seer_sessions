Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Size**: All input grids are 3x3. All output grids are 9x9. This suggests the output is a scaled or tiled version of the input, specifically a 3x3 tiling where each tile is the size of the input grid.
2.  **Content Relationship**: The colors present in the output are the same as those in the input. The output appears to be composed of multiple copies of the input grid, possibly transformed.
3.  **Tile Analysis**: Let's divide the 9x9 output grid into nine 3x3 subgrids (tiles).
    *   **Center Tile**: In all examples, the central 3x3 subgrid (rows 3-5, columns 3-5) of the output is identical to the input grid.
    *   **Adjacent Tiles**:
        *   The subgrids directly above and below the center tile (rows 0-2, cols 3-5 and rows 6-8, cols 3-5) appear to be the input grid flipped vertically.
        *   The subgrids directly to the left and right of the center tile (rows 3-5, cols 0-2 and rows 3-5, cols 6-8) appear to be the input grid flipped horizontally.
    *   **Corner Tiles**: The four corner subgrids (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) appear to be the input grid flipped both horizontally and vertically (or rotated 180 degrees).
4.  **Pattern Confirmation**: This pattern holds consistently across all three training examples. The output grid is a 3x3 arrangement of the input grid and its flipped versions.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the 3x3 input grid.
2.  Create a horizontally flipped version of the input grid.
3.  Create a vertically flipped version of the input grid.
4.  Create a version flipped both horizontally and vertically (180-degree rotation) of the input grid.
5.  Initialize an empty 9x9 output grid.
6.  Place the grid flipped both horizontally and vertically into the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right 3x3 sections of the output grid.
7.  Place the vertically flipped grid into the top-center and bottom-center 3x3 sections of the output grid.
8.  Place the horizontally flipped grid into the middle-left and middle-right 3x3 sections of the output grid.
9.  Place the original input grid into the central 3x3 section of the output grid.
10. Return the completed 9x9 output grid.
