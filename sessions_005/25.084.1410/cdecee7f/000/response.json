            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output:** The input is a 10x10 grid containing mostly white pixels (0) and a few scattered non-white pixels (1-9). The output is always a smaller 3x3 grid.\n2.  **Content:** The output grid seems to contain the same colors that appear in the non-white pixels of the input grid, potentially rearranged. Some output cells are white (0), suggesting that either not all input colors are used or padding is applied.\n3.  **Transformation:** The task involves extracting the non-white pixels from the input grid and arranging their colors into the 3x3 output grid according to a specific rule. The spatial position of the pixels in the input grid determines their order in the output.\n4.  **Order Determination:** Comparing the input pixels and the output grid across examples reveals a specific scanning and placement pattern. The non-white pixels are collected by scanning the input grid column by column, from top to bottom. These collected colors are then placed into the 3x3 output grid, but with a twist: the second row of the output grid is filled using the corresponding segment of the collected colors in reverse order.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"

Scan the input grid column by column, from the leftmost column to the rightmost column. Within each column, scan from the top row to the bottom row.\n3.  For each cell scanned, if the pixel's color is not white (0), append its color value to the `color_sequence` list.\n4.

For each index `i`, if `i` is less than the length of `color_sequence`, set the `output_grid` cell at row 0, column `i` to the color found at `color_sequence[i]`.\n6.

Let's refine: Use `color_sequence[5]` for row 1, col 0; `color_sequence[4]` for row 1, col 1; `color_sequence[3]` for row 1, col 2, checking bounds for each.\n    *   **Correction for clarity:** To fill the second row (row index 1):\n        *   If `color_sequence` has at least 6 elements, set `output_grid[1][0]` = `color_sequence[5]`.\n        *   If `color_sequence` has at least 5 elements, set `output_grid[1][1]` = `color_sequence[4]`.\n        *   If `color_sequence` has at least 4 elements, set `output_grid[1][2]` = `color_sequence[3]`.\n7.
