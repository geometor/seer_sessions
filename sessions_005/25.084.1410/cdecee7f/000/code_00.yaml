task_description: Extract non-white pixels from the input grid based on a column-first scan and arrange them into a 3x3 output grid with specific row-filling rules.

elements:
  - element: input_grid
    description: A 2D grid (typically 10x10) containing mostly white pixels (0) and some scattered non-white pixels (1-9).
  - element: output_grid
    description: A fixed-size 3x3 grid.
  - element: non_white_pixel
    description: A pixel in the input grid with a color value from 1 to 9.
    properties:
      - color: The integer value (1-9).
      - position: The (row, column) coordinates in the input grid.
  - element: color_sequence
    description: An ordered list of colors derived from the non-white pixels in the input grid.

actions:
  - action: scan_input
    description: Iterate through the input grid to find non-white pixels.
    parameters:
      - order: Column-first (scan columns left-to-right, and within each column, scan rows top-to-bottom).
  - action: collect_colors
    description: Create the color_sequence by appending the color of each non-white pixel found during the scan_input action.
  - action: create_output_grid
    description: Initialize a 3x3 grid, typically filled with the background color (white, 0).
  - action: fill_output_grid
    description: Populate the output grid using the color_sequence.
    details:
      - The first row (cells 0, 1, 2) is filled with the first 3 elements of the sequence (if available), in order.
      - The second row (cells 3, 4, 5) is filled with the next 3 elements (elements 3, 4, 5) of the sequence (if available), placed in reverse order (element 5, then 4, then 3).
      - The third row (cells 6, 7, 8) is filled with the next 3 elements (elements 6, 7, 8) of the sequence (if available), in order.
      - If the sequence contains fewer than 9 elements, the remaining cells in the output grid retain their initial background color.

relationships:
  - relationship: sequence_order
    description: The order of colors in the color_sequence is determined by the column-first scan of the input grid.
  - relationship: sequence_to_output_mapping
    description: The color_sequence maps to the output grid cells based on the specific filling rules (row 1 forward, row 2 reversed, row 3 forward).
