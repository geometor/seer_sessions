Okay, let's analyze the task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output:** The input is a 10x10 grid containing mostly white pixels (0) and a few scattered non-white pixels (1-9). The output is always a smaller 3x3 grid.
2.  **Content:** The output grid seems to contain the same colors that appear in the non-white pixels of the input grid, potentially rearranged. Some output cells are white (0), suggesting that either not all input colors are used or padding is applied.
3.  **Transformation:** The task involves extracting the non-white pixels from the input grid and arranging their colors into the 3x3 output grid according to a specific rule. The spatial position of the pixels in the input grid determines their order in the output.
4.  **Order Determination:** Comparing the input pixels and the output grid across examples reveals a specific scanning and placement pattern. The non-white pixels are collected by scanning the input grid column by column, from top to bottom. These collected colors are then placed into the 3x3 output grid, but with a twist: the second row of the output grid is filled using the corresponding segment of the collected colors in reverse order.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
task_description: Extract non-white pixels from the input grid based on a column-first scan and arrange them into a 3x3 output grid with specific row-filling rules.

elements:
  - element: input_grid
    description: A 2D grid (typically 10x10) containing mostly white pixels (0) and some scattered non-white pixels (1-9).
  - element: output_grid
    description: A fixed-size 3x3 grid.
  - element: non_white_pixel
    description: A pixel in the input grid with a color value from 1 to 9.
    properties:
      - color: The integer value (1-9).
      - position: The (row, column) coordinates in the input grid.
  - element: color_sequence
    description: An ordered list of colors derived from the non-white pixels in the input grid.

actions:
  - action: scan_input
    description: Iterate through the input grid to find non-white pixels.
    parameters:
      - order: Column-first (scan columns left-to-right, and within each column, scan rows top-to-bottom).
  - action: collect_colors
    description: Create the color_sequence by appending the color of each non-white pixel found during the scan_input action.
  - action: create_output_grid
    description: Initialize a 3x3 grid, typically filled with the background color (white, 0).
  - action: fill_output_grid
    description: Populate the output grid using the color_sequence.
    details:
      - The first row (cells 0, 1, 2) is filled with the first 3 elements of the sequence (if available), in order.
      - The second row (cells 3, 4, 5) is filled with the next 3 elements (elements 3, 4, 5) of the sequence (if available), placed in reverse order (element 5, then 4, then 3).
      - The third row (cells 6, 7, 8) is filled with the next 3 elements (elements 6, 7, 8) of the sequence (if available), in order.
      - If the sequence contains fewer than 9 elements, the remaining cells in the output grid retain their initial background color.

relationships:
  - relationship: sequence_order
    description: The order of colors in the color_sequence is determined by the column-first scan of the input grid.
  - relationship: sequence_to_output_mapping
    description: The color_sequence maps to the output grid cells based on the specific filling rules (row 1 forward, row 2 reversed, row 3 forward).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty list called `color_sequence`.
2.  Scan the input grid column by column, from the leftmost column to the rightmost column. Within each column, scan from the top row to the bottom row.
3.  For each cell scanned, if the pixel's color is not white (0), append its color value to the `color_sequence` list.
4.  Create a new 3x3 grid, called `output_grid`, and fill all its cells with white (0).
5.  Iterate through the first 3 potential cell indices (0, 1, 2) for the first row of the `output_grid`. For each index `i`, if `i` is less than the length of `color_sequence`, set the `output_grid` cell at row 0, column `i` to the color found at `color_sequence[i]`.
6.  Iterate through the next 3 potential cell indices (3, 4, 5) corresponding to the second row of the `output_grid`. For each index `j` (from 3 to 5), if `j` is less than the length of `color_sequence`:
    *   Calculate the target column index for the second row: `col = j % 3`.
    *   Calculate the source index in `color_sequence` considering the reversal: `source_idx = 3 + (2 - col)`. (This maps index 3 to column 2, 4 to 1, 5 to 0 within the row's segment). Alternatively, use sequence elements `[5]`, `[4]`, `[3]` for row 1, columns 0, 1, 2 respectively. Let's refine: Use `color_sequence[5]` for row 1, col 0; `color_sequence[4]` for row 1, col 1; `color_sequence[3]` for row 1, col 2, checking bounds for each.
    *   **Correction for clarity:** To fill the second row (row index 1):
        *   If `color_sequence` has at least 6 elements, set `output_grid[1][0]` = `color_sequence[5]`.
        *   If `color_sequence` has at least 5 elements, set `output_grid[1][1]` = `color_sequence[4]`.
        *   If `color_sequence` has at least 4 elements, set `output_grid[1][2]` = `color_sequence[3]`.
7.  Iterate through the final 3 potential cell indices (6, 7, 8) corresponding to the third row of the `output_grid`. For each index `k` (from 6 to 8), if `k` is less than the length of `color_sequence`:
    *   Calculate the target column index for the third row: `col = k % 3`.
    *   Set the `output_grid` cell at row 2, column `col` to the color found at `color_sequence[k]`.
8.  Return the completed `output_grid`.
