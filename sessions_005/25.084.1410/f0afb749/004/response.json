            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core transformation mechanic: scaling the grid by a factor of 2 and mapping each input pixel to a 2x2 block in the output. It also correctly handled the mapping for non-white input pixels (filling the 2x2 block with the input color).\n\nHowever, the code failed because it applied a *fixed* pattern (`[[0, 1], [1, 0]]`) to the 2x2 blocks corresponding to white (0) input pixels. The analysis of all three examples reveals that the pattern applied to these white-derived blocks is *conditional*. Specifically, it depends on the spatial relationship between the white input pixel and any non-white neighboring pixels in the *original input grid*.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors is to:\n1.  Re-analyze the relationship between white input pixels and their corresponding 2x2 output blocks across all examples.\n2.  Identify the condition that determines which pattern (`[[0, 0], [0, 0]]` or `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`) is used for the output block derived from a white input pixel.\n3.  Update the natural language program and subsequent code to incorporate this conditional logic.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the transformation for white (0) input pixels based on the provided examples and expected outputs:\n\n**Commonalities:**\n*   Output grid dimensions are always double the input grid dimensions (Height_out = Height_in * 2, Width_out = Width_in * 2).\n*   An input pixel at `(r, c)` maps to the 2x2 output block covering `(2r, 2c)` to `(2r+1, 2c+1)`.\n*   Non-white input pixels (color `C != 0`) result in the corresponding 2x2 output block being filled entirely with color `C`.\n\n**White Pixel (0) Transformation Analysis:**\nBy comparing the input grids and expected output grids, we observe two distinct patterns for the 2x2 blocks derived from white input pixels:\n\n1.  **Pattern 1: All White**\n    "

Diagonal neighbors are at relative positions `(-1, -1), (-1, +1), (+1, -1), (+1, +1)`.\n*   **Otherwise (if a white input pixel has no non-white diagonal neighbors, or only non-white cardinal neighbors, or no non-white neighbors at all)**, its corresponding 2x2 output block uses Pattern 1 (`[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`).\n\n**Verification:**\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input `(0,1)` (white): Cardinal neighbor `(0,0)` (red). No diagonal non-white neighbors. -> Output `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`. Matches expected.\n    *   Input `(1,0)` (white): Cardinal neighbor `(0,0)` (red). No diagonal non-white neighbors. -> Output `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`. Matches expected.\n    *   Input `(1,1)` (white): Diagonal neighbor `(0,0)` (red). -> Output `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`. Matches expected.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input `(0,0)` (white): Diagonal neighbor `(1,1)` (gray). -> Output `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`. Matches expected.\n    *   Input `(0,1)` (white): Cardinal neighbor `(1,1)` (gray). No diagonal non-white neighbors. -> Output `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`. Matches expected.\n    *   Input `(1,4)` (white): Diagonal neighbor `(0,3)` (gray). -> Output `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`. Matches expected.\n    *   Input `(2,0)` (white): Diagonal neighbors `(1,1)` (gray) and `(3,1)` (gray). -> Output `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`. Matches expected.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input `(1,0)` (white): Diagonal neighbor `(2,1)` (green). -> Output `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`. Matches expected.\n    *   Input `(1,5)` (white): Cardinal neighbor `(0,5)` (green). No diagonal non-white neighbors. -> Output `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`. Matches expected.\n    *   Input `(3,2)` (white): Diagonal neighbor `(2,1)` (green). -> Output `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`. Matches expected.\n\nThe hypothesis holds true for all examples. The previous code failed because it only implemented one specific pattern (`[[0, 1], [1, 0]]`, which is incorrect) and did not check for the diagonal adjacency condition.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
