## General Assessment

The previous code correctly identified the core transformation mechanic: scaling the grid by a factor of 2 and mapping each input pixel to a 2x2 block in the output. It also correctly handled the mapping for non-white input pixels (filling the 2x2 block with the input color).

However, the code failed because it applied a *fixed* pattern (`[[0, 1], [1, 0]]`) to the 2x2 blocks corresponding to white (0) input pixels. The analysis of all three examples reveals that the pattern applied to these white-derived blocks is *conditional*. Specifically, it depends on the spatial relationship between the white input pixel and any non-white neighboring pixels in the *original input grid*.

The strategy for resolving the errors is to:
1.  Re-analyze the relationship between white input pixels and their corresponding 2x2 output blocks across all examples.
2.  Identify the condition that determines which pattern (`[[0, 0], [0, 0]]` or `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`) is used for the output block derived from a white input pixel.
3.  Update the natural language program and subsequent code to incorporate this conditional logic.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's analyze the transformation for white (0) input pixels based on the provided examples and expected outputs:

**Commonalities:**
*   Output grid dimensions are always double the input grid dimensions (Height_out = Height_in * 2, Width_out = Width_in * 2).
*   An input pixel at `(r, c)` maps to the 2x2 output block covering `(2r, 2c)` to `(2r+1, 2c+1)`.
*   Non-white input pixels (color `C != 0`) result in the corresponding 2x2 output block being filled entirely with color `C`.

**White Pixel (0) Transformation Analysis:**
By comparing the input grids and expected output grids, we observe two distinct patterns for the 2x2 blocks derived from white input pixels:

1.  **Pattern 1: All White**
    
```
    0 0
    0 0
    ```

2.  **Pattern 2: Blue Anti-diagonal**
    
```
    1 0
    0 1
    ```


**Hypothesis:** The pattern used depends on the neighbors of the white pixel in the *input* grid.

*   **If a white input pixel at `(r, c)` is diagonally adjacent to *any* non-white pixel in the input grid**, its corresponding 2x2 output block uses Pattern 2 (`[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`). Diagonal neighbors are at relative positions `(-1, -1), (-1, +1), (+1, -1), (+1, +1)`.
*   **Otherwise (if a white input pixel has no non-white diagonal neighbors, or only non-white cardinal neighbors, or no non-white neighbors at all)**, its corresponding 2x2 output block uses Pattern 1 (`[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`).

**Verification:**
*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input `(0,1)` (white): Cardinal neighbor `(0,0)` (red). No diagonal non-white neighbors. -> Output `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`. Matches expected.
    *   Input `(1,0)` (white): Cardinal neighbor `(0,0)` (red). No diagonal non-white neighbors. -> Output `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`. Matches expected.
    *   Input `(1,1)` (white): Diagonal neighbor `(0,0)` (red). -> Output `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`. Matches expected.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input `(0,0)` (white): Diagonal neighbor `(1,1)` (gray). -> Output `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`. Matches expected.
    *   Input `(0,1)` (white): Cardinal neighbor `(1,1)` (gray). No diagonal non-white neighbors. -> Output `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`. Matches expected.
    *   Input `(1,4)` (white): Diagonal neighbor `(0,3)` (gray). -> Output `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`. Matches expected.
    *   Input `(2,0)` (white): Diagonal neighbors `(1,1)` (gray) and `(3,1)` (gray). -> Output `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`. Matches expected.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input `(1,0)` (white): Diagonal neighbor `(2,1)` (green). -> Output `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`. Matches expected.
    *   Input `(1,5)` (white): Cardinal neighbor `(0,5)` (green). No diagonal non-white neighbors. -> Output `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`. Matches expected.
    *   Input `(3,2)` (white): Diagonal neighbor `(2,1)` (green). -> Output `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`. Matches expected.

The hypothesis holds true for all examples. The previous code failed because it only implemented one specific pattern (`[[0, 1], [1, 0]]`, which is incorrect) and did not check for the diagonal adjacency condition.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the dimensions (height `H`, width `W`) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions (`H` * 2, `W` * 2), initially filled with a default color (e.g., white=0).
3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at coordinates (`r`, `c`) from `r = 0` to `H-1` and `c = 0` to `W-1`.
4.  Let `input_color` be the color of the pixel at `(r, c)`.
5.  Calculate the top-left coordinates `(out_r, out_c)` for the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid: `out_r = r * 2`, `out_c = c * 2`.
6.  **If `input_color` is not white (0):**
    *   Fill the 2x2 block in the output grid starting at `(out_r, out_c)` entirely with `input_color`. Specifically, set `output[out_r:out_r+2, out_c:out_c+2] = input_color`.
7.  **If `input_color` is white (0):**
    *   Check the four diagonal neighbors of the input pixel `(r, c)` within the bounds of the input grid: `(r-1, c-1)`, `(r-1, c+1)`, `(r+1, c-1)`, `(r+1, c+1)`.
    *   **If any of these valid diagonal neighbors have a color other than white (0):**
        *   Fill the 2x2 block in the output grid starting at `(out_r, out_c)` with the pattern: top-left=blue(1), top-right=white(0), bottom-left=white(0), bottom-right=blue(1). That is: `output[out_r, out_c] = 1`, `output[out_r, out_c+1] = 0`, `output[out_r+1, out_c] = 0`, `output[out_r+1, out_c+1] = 1`.
    *   **Otherwise (if all valid diagonal neighbors are white, or there are no valid diagonal neighbors):**
        *   Fill the 2x2 block in the output grid starting at `(out_r, out_c)` entirely with white (0). That is: `output[out_r:out_r+2, out_c:out_c+2] = 0`.
8.  Return the completed output grid.
