## General Assessment

The previous code failed due to a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `scipy`. This library was initially considered for identifying connected components but was not used in the final implementation of `count_edges_touched`. Therefore, the `import` statement for `scipy` should be removed.

The core logic derived from the first example involved:
1.  Counting the number of grid edges touched by non-white pixels (`E`).
2.  Rotating the grid 180 degrees.
3.  Conditionally shifting the rotated grid up by 2 rows if `E == 1`.

This logic appears consistent across all provided training examples. The strategy is to correct the import error and confirm the logic holds for all cases.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's analyze each example based on the proposed logic:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 4x5 grid, small blue shape in the top-center.
    *   Edges Touched: 1 (Top).
    *   Expected Transformation: Rotate 180 degrees, Shift Up 2.
    *   Result: Consistent with logic (E=1).
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 4x5 grid, blue 'L' shape in the top-right corner.
    *   Edges Touched: 2 (Top, Right).
    *   Expected Transformation: Rotate 180 degrees only.
    *   Result: Consistent with logic (E=2).
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 4x5 grid, small blue shape in the bottom-center.
    *   Edges Touched: 1 (Bottom).
    *   Expected Transformation: Rotate 180 degrees, Shift Up 2.
    *   Result: Consistent with logic (E=1).
*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: 4x5 grid, blue shape touching the left side, top, and bottom.
    *   Edges Touched: 3 (Top, Bottom, Left).
    *   Expected Transformation: Rotate 180 degrees only.
    *   Result: Consistent with logic (E=3).
*   **Example 5:**
    *   Input: 5x5 grid, blue cross shape in the center.
    *   Edges Touched: 0.
    *   Expected Transformation: Rotate 180 degrees only.
    *   Result: Consistent with logic (E=0).

The edge counting function `count_edges_touched` correctly determines the number of edges touched by finding the minimum and maximum row/column indices of non-white pixels and comparing them to the grid boundaries. The logic seems robust for all examples.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Rotate the input grid 180 degrees. If the non-white pixels in the original input grid touched exactly one edge, shift the rotated grid up by 2 rows. Otherwise, use the rotated grid as is.

definitions:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array of integers 0-9
  - name: non_white_pixels
    type: set of coordinates (row, col) where grid[row][col] != 0
  - name: edges_touched
    type: integer count (0-4)

input_grid_properties:
  - grid_dimensions: height, width
  - non_white_pixels: coordinates of pixels with value != 0
  - edges_touched_count:
      description: Number of unique edges (top, bottom, left, right) containing at least one non-white pixel.
      calculation:
        - Find min/max row (r_min, r_max) and col (c_min, c_max) of non_white_pixels.
        - Count = (r_min == 0) + (r_max == height - 1) + (c_min == 0) + (c_max == width - 1)

transformations:
  - action: rotate_180
    input: input_grid
    output: rotated_grid
    description: Rotate the entire grid by 180 degrees.
  - action: shift_up_2
    input: rotated_grid
    output: shifted_grid
    description: Shift the grid content up by 2 rows, filling the bottom 2 rows with white (0).
  - condition: edges_touched_count == 1
    action: Apply shift_up_2 to rotated_grid.
  - condition: edges_touched_count != 1
    action: Use rotated_grid directly.

output_grid:
  - description: The result of the conditional transformation.
  - value: shifted_grid if edges_touched_count == 1, else rotated_grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Identify all non-white pixels (pixels with value > 0).
3.  If there are no non-white pixels, return the input grid unchanged.
4.  Determine the set of grid edges (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) that contain at least one non-white pixel.
5.  Count the number of edges in this set (`E`).
6.  Create a new grid by rotating the input grid 180 degrees.
7.  If `E` is exactly 1:
    a.  Create the final output grid by shifting the content of the rotated grid up by 2 rows.
    b.  Fill the bottom 2 rows of the final output grid with white pixels (0).
8.  If `E` is not equal to 1 (i.e., 0, 2, 3, or 4):
    a.  The final output grid is the 180-degree rotated grid.
9.  Return the final output grid.
