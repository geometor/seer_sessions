            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed due to a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `scipy`. This library was initially considered for identifying connected components but was not used in the final implementation of `count_edges_touched`. Therefore, the `import` statement for `scipy` should be removed.\n\nThe core logic derived from the first example involved:\n1.  Counting the number of grid edges touched by non-white pixels (`E`).\n2.  Rotating the grid 180 degrees.\n3.  Conditionally shifting the rotated grid up by 2 rows if `E == 1`.\n\nThis logic appears consistent across all provided training examples. The strategy is to correct the import error and confirm the logic holds for all cases.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's analyze each example based on the proposed logic:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 4x5 grid, small blue shape in the top-center.\n    *   Edges Touched: 1 (Top).\n    *   Expected Transformation: Rotate 180 degrees, Shift Up 2.\n    *   Result: Consistent with logic (E=1).\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 4x5 grid, blue 'L' shape in the top-right corner.\n    *   Edges Touched: 2 (Top, Right).\n    *   Expected Transformation: Rotate 180 degrees only.\n    *   Result: Consistent with logic (E=2).\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 4x5 grid, small blue shape in the bottom-center.\n    *   Edges Touched: 1 (Bottom).\n    *   Expected Transformation: Rotate 180 degrees, Shift Up 2.\n    *   Result: Consistent with logic (E=1).\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: 4x5 grid, blue shape touching the left side, top, and bottom.\n    *   Edges Touched: 3 (Top, Bottom, Left).\n    *   Expected Transformation: Rotate 180 degrees only.\n    *   Result: Consistent with logic (E=3).\n*   **Example 5:**\n    *   Input: 5x5 grid, blue cross shape in the center.\n    *   Edges Touched: 0.\n    *   Expected Transformation: Rotate 180 degrees only.\n    *   Result: Consistent with logic (E=0).\n\nThe edge counting function `count_edges_touched` correctly determines the number of edges touched by finding the minimum and maximum row/column indices of non-white pixels and comparing them to the grid boundaries. The logic seems robust for all examples.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
