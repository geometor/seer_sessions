task_description: Rotate the input grid 180 degrees. If the non-white pixels in the original input grid touched exactly one edge, shift the rotated grid up by 2 rows. Otherwise, use the rotated grid as is.

definitions:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array of integers 0-9
  - name: non_white_pixels
    type: set of coordinates (row, col) where grid[row][col] != 0
  - name: edges_touched
    type: integer count (0-4)

input_grid_properties:
  - grid_dimensions: height, width
  - non_white_pixels: coordinates of pixels with value != 0
  - edges_touched_count:
      description: Number of unique edges (top, bottom, left, right) containing at least one non-white pixel.
      calculation:
        - Find min/max row (r_min, r_max) and col (c_min, c_max) of non_white_pixels.
        - Count = (r_min == 0) + (r_max == height - 1) + (c_min == 0) + (c_max == width - 1)

transformations:
  - action: rotate_180
    input: input_grid
    output: rotated_grid
    description: Rotate the entire grid by 180 degrees.
  - action: shift_up_2
    input: rotated_grid
    output: shifted_grid
    description: Shift the grid content up by 2 rows, filling the bottom 2 rows with white (0).
  - condition: edges_touched_count == 1
    action: Apply shift_up_2 to rotated_grid.
  - condition: edges_touched_count != 1
    action: Use rotated_grid directly.

output_grid:
  - description: The result of the conditional transformation.
  - value: shifted_grid if edges_touched_count == 1, else rotated_grid.
