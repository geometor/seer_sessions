The background is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Content:** The input grids contain various colored pixels (non-zero values), sometimes forming simple shapes or patterns.\n3.  **Transformation:** Comparing input and output grids across the examples, the arrangement of colored pixels changes, but the colors themselves and their relative spatial configuration (if viewed as a rotated whole) seem preserved.\n4.  **Size:** The dimensions (height and width) of the output grid are always identical to the input grid.\n5.  **Geometric Operation:** In each example, the output grid appears to be a 180-degree rotation of the input grid. The pixel at the top-left corner moves to the bottom-right, the pixel at the top-right moves to the bottom-left, and so on. Pixels are effectively mapped from position (r, c) to (H-1-r, W-1-c), where H is the height and W is the width of the grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
