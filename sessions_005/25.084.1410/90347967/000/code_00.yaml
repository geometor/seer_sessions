task_description: Apply a geometric transformation to the input grid.

elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (colors)
      - dimensions: height (H), width (W) vary per example
      - background_color: white (0)
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - type: cell within the grid
      - value: color (integer 0-9)
      - position: row (r), column (c)

transformation:
  - type: geometric_rotation
    details:
      - angle: 180 degrees
      - center: center of the grid
      - mapping: Input pixel at (r, c) moves to output position (H-1-r, W-1-c).

input_output_relationship:
  - rule: The output grid is the input grid rotated by 180 degrees.
  - preservation:
    - Grid dimensions (height and width) are preserved.
    - The set of non-background colors present is preserved.
    - The relative arrangement of colored pixels is preserved under rotation.
