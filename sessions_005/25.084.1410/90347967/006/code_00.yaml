observations:
  - task_type: object_transformation
  - background_color: white (0)
  - relevant_pixels: non-white pixels (values > 0)

input_properties:
  - grid_dimensions: variable (e.g., 3x3, 7x9, 9x9)
  - content: groups of non-white pixels forming implicit shapes/objects.
  - property_measured: number_of_edges_touched
    - definition: Counts how many of the four grid boundaries (top, bottom, left, right) contain at least one non-white pixel.
    - calculation:
      1. Find all non-white pixels.
      2. Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by these pixels.
      3. Check if min_row is 0 (touches top), max_row is height-1 (touches bottom), min_col is 0 (touches left), max_col is width-1 (touches right).
      4. Sum the number of conditions met (result is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4).

transformations:
  - base_operation: rotate_180
    - description: The entire input grid is rotated 180 degrees.
  - conditional_operation: shift_up
    - condition: The number_of_edges_touched in the *original input grid* is exactly 1.
    - description: After the rotate_180 operation, the grid content is shifted vertically upwards by 2 rows.
    - effect: The top 2 rows of the rotated content are discarded, the remaining content moves up 2 positions, and the bottom 2 rows are filled with the background color (white).
  - final_output:
    - if number_of_edges_touched == 1: result of rotate_180 followed by shift_up(2).
    - if number_of_edges_touched != 1: result of rotate_180 only.

edge_cases:
 - If the input grid contains only white pixels, it is returned unchanged (implicit, but confirmed by code). This case results in 0 edges touched, falling under the `!= 1` condition, and rotating an all-white grid results in the same all-white grid.
