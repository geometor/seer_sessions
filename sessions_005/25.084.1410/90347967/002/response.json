Rotate 180 degrees globally: `G_rot = rotate180(G_in)`\n2. Calculate shift: `shift = N - 2` (where N was thought to be object count, but maybe it's something else?) Or maybe the shift is constant? Shift was -2 rows.\n3. Apply shift: `G_out = shift_up(G_rot, 2)`\n\nLet's apply this `Rotate-then-ShiftUp(2)` rule to Ex 1 & 2.\n*   Example 1: Input (3x3).\n    Rotate 180:\n    "

(r_out, c_out)=(2,6).\n\n    Let's test the global 180 rotation mapping on the BB top-left corners:\n    Map (r, c) -> (H-1-r, W-1-c).\n    *   Ex 1: (0,0) -> (3-1-0, 3-1-0) = (2, 2). This should be related to the *output* BB corner. Output BB is (0,1) to (2,2). The rotated point (2,2) is the bottom-right corner of the output BB.\n    *   Ex 2: (3,1) -> (7-1-3, 9-1-1) = (3, 7). Output BB is (1,6) to (3,9)? No, (1,6) to (3,9) covers the area. BB size 3x4. Top-left (1,6), Bottom-right (1+3-1, 6+4-1) = (3, 9). The rotated point (3,7) is inside the output BB.\n    *   Ex 3: (2,0) -> (9-1-2, 9-1-0) = (6, 8). Output BB is (2,6) to (4,9)? No, BB size 3x4. Top-left (2,6), Bottom-right (2+3-1, 6+4-1) = (4, 9). The rotated point (6,8) is *outside* the output BB.\n\n    This suggests the global 180 rotation isn't the right way to think about the BB position either.\n\n    Let's reconsider the mapping:\n    *   Ex 1: (r_in, c_in)=(0,0) -> (r_out, c_out)=(0,1). W=3, w=2. c_out = W - c_in - w? 3 - 0 - 2 = 1. Yes. r_out = r_in? Yes.\n    *   Ex 2: (r_in, c_in)=(3,1) -> (r_out, c_out)=(1,6). H=7, h=3. W=9, w=4.\n        *   Test r_out = r_in: 1 != 3. No.\n        *   Test c_out = W - c_in - w: 9 - 1 - 4 = 4. No, c_out is 6.\n        *   Test r_out = H - r_in - h: 7 - 3 - 3 = 1. Yes.\n        *   Test c_out = W - c_in - w: Still 4, not 6. What about W - (c_in + w) + 1? 9 - (1+4) + 1 = 5. No. What about W - c_in - 1? 9 - 1 - 1 = 7. No. What about W - (c_in + w - 1) -1 ? No.\n        *   Let's use bottom-right corners. Input BB BR: (r_in+h-1, c_in+w-1) = (3+3-1, 1+4-1) = (5, 4). Output BB BR: (r_out+h-1, c_out+w-1) = (1+3-1, 6+4-1) = (3, 9).\n        *   Map (5, 4) -> (H-1-r, W-1-c) = (7-1-5, 9-1-4) = (1, 4). This should be related to the *output* BB. Output is (1,6) to (3,9). (1, 4) is not a corner.\n\n    **Alternative Hypothesis: Rotate content within BB, place BB according to 180 rotation of BB center.**\n    *   Ex 1: Grid 3x3. BB (0,0) to (2,1). Center approx (1, 0.5). Rotate center (1, 0.5) -> (3-1-1, 3-1-0.5) = (1, 1.5). This should be the center of the output BB. Output BB is (0,1) to (2,2). Center is (1, 1.5). Matches.\n    *   Ex 2: Grid 7x9. BB (3,1) to (5,4). Center approx (4, 2.5). Rotate center (4, 2.5) -> (7-1-4, 9-1-2.5) = (2, 5.5). This should be the center of the output BB. Output BB is (1,6) to (3,9). Center is (2, 7.5). Doesn't match (2, 5.5).\n    *   Ex 3: Grid 9x9. BB (2,0) to (4,3). Center approx (3, 1.5). Rotate center (3, 1.5) -> (9-1-3, 9-1-1.5) = (5, 6.5). This should be the center of the output BB. Output BB is (2,6) to (4,9). Center is (3, 7.5). Doesn't match (5, 6.5).\n\n    **Okay, the simplest explanation is often the best.** The first code implementing global 180 rotation worked for Ex1 and Ex2, and produced the *correct pattern* but *wrong location* for Ex3.\n    Why would the location be different only for Ex3?\n\n    Let's look at the transformation `(r, c) -> (H-1-r, W-1-c)` and compare the resulting grid (`G_rot`) with the expected grid (`G_exp`).\n\n    *   Ex 1: `G_rot` == `G_exp`.\n    *   Ex 2: `G_rot` == `G_exp`.\n    *   Ex 3: `G_rot` != `G_exp`. `G_exp` seems to be `G_rot` shifted UP by 2 rows.\n\n    Is there a property P such that P is true for Ex3 but false for Ex1, Ex2? And the rule is:\n    1. Rotate 180 degrees to get `G_rot`.\n    2. If P(Input) is true, shift `G_rot` up by 2 rows.\n    3. Else, output `G_rot`.\n\n    What could P be?\n    *   N > 2? No, N=1 for all.\n    *   Grid is square (W==H)? Yes for Ex1 (3x3), No for Ex2 (7x9), Yes for Ex3 (9x9). Doesn't distinguish Ex3 uniquely.\n    *   Grid size > threshold? Ex1 (3x3=9), Ex2 (7x9=63), Ex3 (9x9=81). Maybe size > 60? No, Ex1 would fail.\n    *   Object touches edge? Ex1 (Yes), Ex2 (No), Ex3 (Yes). Doesn't distinguish Ex3 uniquely.\n    *   Object touches exactly one edge? Ex1 (Touches 2 edges: Top, Left). Ex2 (Touches 0 edges). Ex3 (Touches 1 edge: Left). **This is a potential differentiator!**\n\n    **Hypothesis 3:**\n    1. Find the single connected object (non-white pixels).\n    2. Determine which grid edges (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) the object touches.\n    3. Count the number of edges touched, `E`.\n    4. Perform a 180-degree rotation of the entire grid to get `G_rot`.\n    5. If `E == 1`, shift `G_rot` upwards by 2 rows to get the final output.\n    6. If `E != 1`, the final output is `G_rot`.\n\n    **Test Hypothesis 3:**\n    *   Ex 1: Object BB (0,0)-(2,1). Grid 3x3. Touches Top (r=0), Left (c=0). `E = 2`. Rule: Output = `G_rot`. Matches observed correct behavior.\n    *   Ex 2: Object BB (3,1)-(5,4). Grid 7x9. Doesn't touch Top (r=0), Bottom (r=6), Left (c=0), Right (c=8). `E = 0`. Rule: Output = `G_rot`. Matches observed correct behavior.\n    *   Ex 3: Object BB (2,0)-(4,3). Grid 9x9. Doesn't touch Top (r=0), Bottom (r=8), Right (c=8). Touches Left (c=0). `E = 1`. Rule: Output = `shift_up(G_rot, 2)`. Matches the transformation needed to correct the error in the previous attempt.\n\n    This hypothesis seems consistent with all examples.\n\n    **Need code to check edge touching:**\n    Find min/max row/col of non-white pixels (r_min, r_max, c_min, c_max).\n    Touches Top if r_min == 0.\n    Touches Bottom if r_max == H-1.\n    Touches Left if c_min == 0.\n    Touches Right if c_max == W-1.\n    Count how many of these are true.\n"

Otherwise, only the 180-degree rotation is applied.\n\nNeed to refine the YAML and NL program.\n\n**Shift Implementation Detail:** When shifting up by 2 rows, pixels in rows 0 and 1 of the rotated grid are lost, and the bottom 2 rows of the output grid become white (0). This seems consistent with the Example 3 output.## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the transformation for the first two examples as a 180-degree rotation. However, this failed for the third example. Comparing the expected output for Example 3 with the output generated by the 180-degree rotation code revealed that the pattern (shape and relative pixel positions) was correct, but its absolute position within the grid was shifted upwards by 2 rows.\n\nThis suggests a conditional transformation. The task is to identify the condition present in Example 3 but absent in Examples 1 and 2 that triggers this vertical shift after the rotation.\n\n## Strategy\n\n1.  Verify the properties of the input grid for all examples, specifically focusing on object properties and their relation to the grid boundaries.\n2.  Use `tool_code` to calculate metrics like the number of connected components and the number of grid edges touched by the components.\n3.  Formulate a hypothesis based on these metrics that explains the difference in transformation for Example 3.\n4.  Test the hypothesis against all examples.\n5.  Refine the natural language program to describe the complete conditional transformation rule.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nUsing `tool_code` to analyze the grids, the following metrics were gathered:\n\n"
