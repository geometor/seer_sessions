task_context:
  - The transformation involves rotating the input grid and potentially shifting the result vertically.
  - All examples contain a single connected object composed of non-white pixels (using 8-connectivity).
  - The key factor determining the transformation type is the number of grid edges (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) touched by this single object.

grid_properties:
  - Grid dimensions vary between examples.
  - Input grids contain a single connected object (non-white pixels).
  - The background color is white (0).

object_properties:
  - Object: A single connected component of non-white pixels.
  - Property: Number of grid edges touched (E).
    - Example 1: E = 3
    - Example 2: E = 0
    - Example 3: E = 1

transformation_steps:
  - Step 1: Identify the single connected object of non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - Step 2: Determine the number of grid edges (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) that the object touches (E).
  - Step 3: Rotate the entire input grid by 180 degrees to create an intermediate grid.
  - Step 4: Conditional Shift:
    - If E equals 1, shift the entire intermediate grid upwards by 2 rows. Pixels shifted off the top edge are discarded, and the bottom two rows are filled with the background color (white, 0).
    - If E is not equal to 1 (i.e., E=0, 2, 3, or 4), no shift is applied.
  - Step 5: The result of Step 4 is the final output grid.
