            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code are too simplistic. The rule \"remove any digit that has zero as both neighbors\" only partially captures the transformation. It seems the core idea is about removing \"noise\" \u2013 isolated non-zero digits surrounded by zeros. However, the current rule doesn't handle cases where multiple consecutive non-zero digits of the *same* value exist (e.g., \"4 4 4\" should be kept, but isolated 4s should be removed). The provided examples clearly highlight the cases with consecutive digits where it does not remove digits as expected.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine the Definition of Noise:** We need to distinguish between isolated digits and sequences of the same digit.\n2.  **Contextual Removal:** The removal should depend on whether a digit is part of a \"cluster\" of identical digits or a lone \"island.\"\n3.  **Iterative Improvement:** use the code execution information to revise the program and code.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using code execution - although I cannot execute it here, I am presenting what *would* be done):**\n\nI cannot directly execute code here. If I could, I would write python code to:\n1. load each input and expected output grid.\n2. compare the input, expected, and transformed outputs element-wise, creating detailed diff reports.\n3. summarize findings on each example - number of pixels that are different\nbetween transformed and expected and the indices where they differ.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
