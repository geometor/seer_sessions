Here's my breakdown of the input-output examples:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 3x3 grids with single-digit integer values (0-9) representing colors. It appears that a specific transformation is applied based on the positions and values of non-zero pixels. The zero values (white pixels) seem to act as a background or unchanged elements. There is a consistent pattern of filling/extending certain colors downwards and horizontally.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

So that, all cells below the source pixel in the output grid is changed to the color of source pixel.\n\n4.  **Combine:** Perform steps two and three sequentially.\n\nIn essence, the transformation involves a prioritized horizontal fill from top-right element combined with downward expansion of colors for any non-zero colored cells.\n"
