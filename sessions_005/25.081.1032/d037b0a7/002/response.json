            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and subsequent code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a limited understanding from the first training example. While it correctly handled examples 2 and 3, it failed on example 1. The core issue is the over-prioritization of the top-right element's color and how the horizontal fill is managed. The initial program seems to be a blend of two ideas: \"filling from the top right\" and \"expanding existing colors down\". The \"filling from top-right\" idea is not universally true and needs to be discarded or restricted correctly. The rule application needs to be refined.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Example 1 Failure:** Focus on the specific pixels that were incorrect in example 1 and how they relate to their neighbors in the input.\n2.  **Re-evaluate the Horizontal Fill:**  The logic incorrectly applied the top-right color fill. We must determine when and *if* a horizontal fill needs to occur, it needs to happen after the vertical fills.\n3.  **Refine Vertical Fill Logic:** The core concept of expanding non-zero colors downward is sound. But has some error in a special circumstance where the top-right pixel is not zero.\n4.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Create a more precise description of the transformation, focusing on the order of operations.\n5.  **Update yaml facts, program, and code.**\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code for verification when needed):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Top-right color: 6 (magenta)\n    *   Pixels Off: 4\n    *   Problem: The magenta (6) from the top-right incorrectly overwrites other colors in rows below during the vertical fill.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Top-right color: 8 (azure)\n    *   Pixels Off: 0\n    *   Success: The vertical fill logic works correctly when there's no interference.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Top-right color: 0 (white)\n    *   Pixels Off: 0\n    *   Success: The top-right is zero, so no top-right fill, and other colors extend correctly.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
