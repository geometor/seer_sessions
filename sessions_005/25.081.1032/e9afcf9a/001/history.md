## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9
```


**output:**
```
3 9 3 9 3 9
9 3 9 3 9 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
4 4 4 4 4 4
8 8 8 8 8 8
```


**output:**
```
4 8 4 8 4 8
8 4 8 4 8 4
```

Okay, I'm ready to analyze this task and provide my observations.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two rows of single-digit numbers in the input, which are then transformed into an output with the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve an alternating pattern of the two input rows. The colors corresponding to input digits are alternating in output grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: row
    properties:
      - values: [list of integers]
      - length: equal for all rows
    relationships:
      - stacked: rows are vertically stacked on each other
actions:
  - name: alternate
    description: create a new grid by taking alternating values from the input rows
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observe** the two input rows.
2.  **Create** a new grid with the same dimensions.
3.  **Fill** the first row of the output grid by alternating the digits of the two given input rows, start with the top row.
4.   **Fill** the second row of the output grid by alternating the digits of the two given input rows, start with the bottom row.

In essence, the transformation takes two rows of numbers and interleaves them in an alternating pattern, row by row, starting the second row's filling with the bottom row.
