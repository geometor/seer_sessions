"""
The transformation rule is a reflection (or a flip) of the input grid across its anti-diagonal (the diagonal line from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner). This means that the element at position (i, j) in the input grid will be moved to the position (n_cols - 1 - j, n_rows - 1 - i) in the output grid, where n_rows is the number of rows, and n_cols is the number of columns in the input grid.
