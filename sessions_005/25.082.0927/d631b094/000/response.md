Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output examples to discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The input grids are 3x3, while the output grids vary in size but seem to be related to the non-zero elements in the input. The transformation appears to focus on extracting and potentially replicating the non-zero values from the input grid. The zero values (white pixels) in the input grids seem to act as a background or are ignored.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: variable
      - elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - color: derived_from_value

actions:
  - name: extract_non_zero_pixels
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_non_zero_pixels
  - name: create_output_grid
    input: list_of_non_zero_pixels
    output: output_grid

relationships:
  - input_grid contains multiple pixels
  - output_grid contains pixels derived from input_grid's non-zero pixels.
  - output_grid size is determined by quantity and value of the unique colors in input_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Examine the input grid and identify all pixels with values other than 0.
2.  **Extract Unique Colors:** Create a set of unique colors from the non-zero pixels.
3.  **Determine Output Size:** The dimensions of the output seem related to how many of each non-zero color are in each grid.
    *   train\_1 has one of two colors so the output is 1x2,
    *   train\_2 has one unique non-zero pixel that appears three times so the result is 1x3,
    *   train\_3 has one unique non-zero color that appears one time so the output grid is 1x1
    *   train\_4 has eight copies of one unique non-zero color so the grid is 1x8
4.  **Construct Output:** Create a new grid of determined dimensions, where all the values are the non-zero colors.

In summary, the transformation extracts the non-zero pixels from the input grid, creating the output grid's dimensions by multiplying the length of the unique values by their repetition.
