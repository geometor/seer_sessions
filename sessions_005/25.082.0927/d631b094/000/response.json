Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The input grids are 3x3, while the output grids vary in size but seem to be related to the non-zero elements in the input. The transformation appears to focus on extracting and potentially replicating the non-zero values from the input grid. The zero values (white pixels) in the input grids seem to act as a background or are ignored.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
