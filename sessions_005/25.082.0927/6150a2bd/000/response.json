There are no explicit shape definitions.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve rearranging and/or mirroring the input grid to produce the output grid. The dimensions of input/output are maintained.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

This can also be considered as inverting or reversing the row and column orders from the input to generate the output.\n2.  Preserve Colors: preserve the original color values in their new locations in the output.\n\nIn essence, the transformation takes each element at position (i, j) in the input grid and places it at position (height - 1 - i, width - 1 - j) in the output grid, where 'height' is the number of rows and 'width' is the number of columns in the grid. This effectively rotates the grid 180 degrees, or inverts rows and columns.\n"
