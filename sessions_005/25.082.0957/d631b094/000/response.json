The output grid's dimensions and content seem directly related to the non-zero elements present in the input grid. The zero values (white pixels) in the input grid appear to be irrelevant or act as a background. The core operation seems to be extracting and potentially replicating the non-zero values. The number of times each non zero number is repeated seem to be how many times it exists on the diagonals.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
