objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - output_grid:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: variable
      elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - non_zero_elements:
      type: list
      elements: single-digit integers (1-9) from input_grid

properties:
  - input_grid_values: values present in the input grid
  - output_grid_values: values present in the output grid
  - count: number of occurrences of non-zero elements along diagonals

actions:
  - extraction: identify and extract non-zero elements from the input grid.
  - replication: repeat non-zero elements.
  - construction: form the output grid using the replicated elements.

relationships:
  - input_to_output_size: output grid size is determined by the number of non-zero and how often it is in diagonals elements in the input grid.
  - input_to_output_content: output grid content consists of the replicated non-zero elements from the input grid.
