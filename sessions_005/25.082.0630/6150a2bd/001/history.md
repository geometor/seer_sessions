## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid. The dimensions of the input and output grids appear to be the same (both 3x3 in the examples provided, which I can confirm using python later). The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple color substitution; instead, the positions of the colors change. It looks like some form of rotation or reflection, maybe with values inverted. It's crucial to check if it's a consistent geometric transformation or something more complex.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The numbers in the input grid reappear in the output grid, but in different positions.
  - observation: "0" seems to act like a background/padding
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (example 1), 3x3 (example2)
      - values: integers 0-9
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (example 1), 3x3 (example2)
      - values: integers 0-9
  - relationship: input_grid is transformed to output_grid
  - action: Values are repositioned, possibly through rotation/reflection.
  - hypothesis: The transformation inverts row order
  - hypothesis: The transformation mirrors columns order
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Reverse Rows:** The order of rows in the input grid is reversed. The last row becomes the first, the second-to-last becomes the second, and so on.
2. **Reverse Columns:** Reverse the order of columns. The order of columns in the input grid is reversed. The last column becomes the first, the second-to-last becomes the second, and so on.
3.  The transformed grid is the output.

In simpler terms, the input matrix is rotated by 180 degrees.
