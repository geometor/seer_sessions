The dimensions of the input and output grids appear to be the same (both 3x3 in the examples provided, which I can confirm using python later). The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple color substitution; instead, the positions of the colors change. It looks like some form of rotation or reflection, maybe with values inverted. It's crucial to check if it's a consistent geometric transformation or something more complex.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
