The surrounding zeros seem to act as a frame or background that's discarded. The output grid's dimensions are determined by the number of non-zero pixels of the non-zero pixel in the input and their values. It seems the dimensions are set to number of occurances of a color in the row or column.\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n"

For each row, count this as a row in the output. Do the same with columns for columns in the output.\n4. **Construct Output:** Create an output grid. Fill the output grid with pixels of the color, iterating over each pixel color found.\n\nEssentially, the transformation rule isolates the non-zero colored pixels and then constructs new grid from them. The rule seems to count non-zero value in rows, then columns, if value are present, construct a new row, and do the same with columns.\n"
