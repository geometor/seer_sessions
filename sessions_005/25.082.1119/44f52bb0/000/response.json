Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color (0-9). The predominant colors are '0' (white) and '2' (red).\n*   **Output:** The output is a single-digit integer. It appears to be either '1' or '7'.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation doesn't seem to involve any complex spatial manipulations or grid alterations. The output being a single digit suggests a counting or aggregation process based on the input grid's contents. The key seems to be related to the configuration of the red ('2') pixels.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"
