task: 3c9b0459
observations:
  - type: grid_transformation
    description: The input grid's rows are reordered.
    details:
      - object: input_grid
        property: rows
        action: reversed
      - object: output_grid
        derivation: derived from input_grid by reversing the order of rows
      - general:
          size_invariant: true  # grid size could vary
          pixel_values: integers from 0-9 representing colors.
          row_order: input rows are reversed.
