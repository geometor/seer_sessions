The transformation rule involves two main steps:
1. Move Column 2 to Column 1: The second column of the input grid becomes the first column of the output grid.
2. Transform Remaining Columns: The first and third columns of the input are changed according to a yet-to-be-determined rule, resulting in columns 2 and 3 in the output.
