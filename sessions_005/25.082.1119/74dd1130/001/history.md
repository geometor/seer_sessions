Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another 3x3 grid. The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple arithmetic or overall grid manipulations like rotation or reflection. Instead, it appears to be a permutation of the cell values within the grid, a reordering. The positions of the numbers, are being shuffled, not changed. The mapping looks to be one to one.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single_digit integers (0-9)
    transformation_type: permutation
    element_properties:
      - color: (represented by integer value)
      - position: (row, column index)
    observations:
      - input_1:  "2 2 1; 1 5 1; 5 2 2"  -> output_1: "2 1 5; 2 5 2; 1 1 2"
      - input_2: "2 2 5; 6 2 2; 5 5 5" -> output_2: "2 6 5; 2 2 5; 5 2 5"
      - input_3: "9 9 5; 5 5 8; 5 8 9" -> output_3: "9 5 5; 9 5 8; 5 8 9"
      - input_4: "2 6 6; 2 1 1; 2 6 2" -> output_4: "2 2 2; 6 1 6; 6 1 2"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rearranges the elements of the input grid to produce the output grid. It seems columns are transposed in some fashion. Let's look at input and output side by side:

*Example 1*

Input:


```
2 2 1
1 5 1
5 2 2
```


Output:


```
2 1 5
2 5 2
1 1 2
```


*Example 2*

Input:


```
2 2 5
6 2 2
5 5 5
```


Output:


```
2 6 5
2 2 5
5 2 5
```


*Example 3*

Input:


```
9 9 5
5 5 8
5 8 9
```


Output:


```
9 5 5
9 5 8
5 8 9
```


*Example 4*

Input:


```
2 6 6
2 1 1
2 6 2
```


Output:


```
2 2 2
6 1 6
6 1 2
```


The transformation rule swaps the columns. Specifically the second column in the input becomes the first column of the output. The first column of the input becomes the second column of the output, and the third columns remain unchanged.

1.  **Swap**: Move the values from the second column of the input grid to the first column of the output grid.
2.  **Swap**: Move the values from the first column of the input grid to the second column of the output grid.
3.  **Keep**: Keep the values in third column of input grid in place, into the third column of output grid.
