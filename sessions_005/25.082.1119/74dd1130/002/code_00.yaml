facts:
  - task: "Column and Row Manipulation"
  - example_1:
    - observation: "The transformation is not a simple column swap."
    - input_objects:  "3x3 grid"
    - output_objects: "3x3 grid"
    - actions: "Pixels are rearranged and potentially re-colored based on position and possibly original color."
    - details: "Input column 2 moves to output column 1, Input first column does NOT become Output second column. Instead colors in column 1 change and color in columns 2 and 3 change, but in different patterns."

  - example_2:
    - observation: "Again, not a simple column swap."
    - input_objects:  "3x3 grid"
    - output_objects: "3x3 grid"
    - actions: "Similar positional and color-based changes as in example 1."
    - details: "Input column 2 moves to output column 1, columns 2 and 3 have changes based on an unknown rule."
  - example_3:
    - observation: "Consistent with previous examples, indicating a general rule, not random changes."
    - input_objects:  "3x3 grid"
    - output_objects: "3x3 grid"
    - actions: "Pixel rearrangement and color modification."
      - details: "Input column 2 moves to output column 1, columns 2 and 3 have changes based on an unknown rule."

  - example_4:
    - observation: "Confirms the rule applies across different input color patterns."
    - input_objects:  "3x3 grid"
    - output_objects: "3x3 grid"
    - actions: "Pixel positions and colors change based on consistent transformation logic."
      - details: "Input column 2 moves to output column 1, columns 2 and 3 have changes based on an unknown rule."
