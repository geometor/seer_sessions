The transformation rule involves two main steps:
1. Move Column 2 to Column 1: The second column of the input grid becomes the first column of the output grid.
2. Transform Remaining Columns: The first and third columns of the input are changed according to a yet-to-be-determined rule, resulting in columns 2 and 3 in the output.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Move the second column of the input to the first column of the output
    output_grid[:, 0] = input_grid[:, 1]

    # Placeholder for the complex transformation of the remaining columns
    # This part needs to be updated with the actual transformation logic once it's determined.
    # For now, we just keep columns 2 and 3 of the original, knowing this is incorrect.
    output_grid[:, 1] = input_grid[:, 0] # Incorrect, to be replaced later. Previous iteration had this.
    output_grid[:, 2] = input_grid[:, 2]  # Incorrect, just keep the same, to be replaced.
