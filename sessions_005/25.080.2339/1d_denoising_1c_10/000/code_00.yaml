facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids are 1-dimensional and of the same length.
  - observation: |
      The input grids contain a sequence of one color value, bordered on either side by zeros.
  - observation: |
      The output grids preserve the central sequence of non-zero color values.
  - observation: |
      The output has leading and trailing zero values.
  - observation: |
      The transformation appears to remove single isolated colored values, and replace by zeroes, on the edges.
  - property: |
      Color of the central sequence is variable (blue=1 in examples 1 and 2, green=3 in example 3).
  - property: |
      Length of the central color segment is variable.
  - property: |
     Number of leading and trailing zeros can vary.
