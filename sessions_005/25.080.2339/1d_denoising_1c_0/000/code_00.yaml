facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids are 1x32."
  - observation: "Pixels are represented by integers 0-9, corresponding to colors."
  - observation: "Predominant colors are 0 (white), 2 (red), and 4 (yellow)."
  - object_type: "Pixel"
    properties:
      - color: "Integer value (0-9)"
    states:
      - isolated: "Surrounded by pixels of a different color."
      - contiguous: "Adjacent to at least one pixel of the same color."
  - action: "Removal"
    condition: "Isolated non-white pixels."
    result: "Pixel color changes to 0 (white)."
  - action: "Preservation"
    condition: "Non-white pixels forming a contiguous block."
    result: "Pixels retain their original color."
  - relationship: "adjacency"
