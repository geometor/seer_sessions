            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize on how to improve the natural language program and, consequently, the code.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code focus on removing \"isolated\" cells in a 1D grid, based on their immediate neighbors. The results clearly show that this rule is not universally applicable across all examples. While it might have partially worked for the first example (though my analysis below will verify this), it fails for the second and third. The strategy should involve:\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to *which* cells are removed and *which* are retained, and *why*. The current code considers only horizontal neighbors. The examples might involve other patterns or relationships.\n\n2.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the detailed analysis, reformulate the hypothesis about the transformation rule. It's likely that we need to broaden our definition of \"isolated\" or consider a different rule altogether. We may be dealing with identifying sections or runs of same-colored pixels\n\n3.  **Fact Documentation:** Create a YAML document to list specific observations about the objects (contiguous blocks of color), their properties (color, length), and the actions (removal, preservation, modification) observed in the examples.\n\n4.  **Natural Language Program Update:** Rewrite the natural language program based on the refined hypothesis, aiming for clarity and precision.\n\n**Gathering Metrics and Analysis (with Code Execution)**\n\nTo better understand the mismatches, I'll use code to compare the outputs of the provided `transform` function with the expected outputs, pixel by pixel. This will help highlight the exact discrepancies.\n\n"
