"""
Iterate through each cell in the input grid. For each cell, check its immediate neighbors (left and right).
If a cell's value is different from both of its neighbors, remove it (change its value to 0).
If a cell's value is the same as *either* of its neighbors, keep it.
Cells at the edges of the grid are considered to *always* have a matching neighbor off the edge, so they are always kept.
Output the updated grid.
