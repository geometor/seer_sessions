Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, including my perception of the elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids as input and output. The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The input grids seem to have a common structure: a single non-zero color embedded within a field of zeros. The output grids appear to be related to the non-zero color in the input grid, and its position. The output grid is smaller than the input grid. The output size seems to be correlated to the number of the single non-zero color pixels in the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are 3x3.
  - observation: Output grids vary in size (1x1, 1x2, 1x3).
  - observation: Input grids contain only one non-zero color.
  - observation: The non-zero color in the input appears in the output.
  - observation: The output grid consists of only the non-zero color from the input.
  - observation: "The dimensions of output grid is equal to count of non-zero color in input."
  - relationship: Output grid size appears related to the count of the non-zero color in the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the non-zero color:** Scan the input grid to find the single color value that is not zero.
2.  **Count target color**: count the number of pixels that match the color of the identified non-zero color.
3.  **Construct the output grid:** Create a new grid. The length of new grid is equal to number of non-zero color in input. Fill the output grid entirely with the identified non-zero color.

Essentially the rule consolidates or extracts the non-zero color and creates a dense, filled grid of only that color. The new grid size seems to equal to how many pixels had that color in original grid.
