The output grid consists of a single, repeated integer, suggesting a kind of simplification or reduction of the input. The specific integer used in the output grid seems to be derived from the input, rather than being a fixed constant. It appears that there's no geometric changes, mirroring, rotation, or complex object interaction. Just an operation on the values.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
