Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both grids of digits, likely representing colored pixels.
*   **Digits/Colors:** Each digit corresponds to a specific color (as defined in the problem description).
*   **Rearrangement:** The digits (and thus the colored pixels) are being rearranged between the input and output. There's no change in the overall set of digits used, they have not changed.
*    **Shape:** The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
*   **Orientation**: It appears that the orientation of the entire grid has been rotated, specifically by 90 degrees clockwise.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and Output are grids of the same dimensions.
  - type: digits
    description: Digits 0-9 represent colors.
  - type: transformation
    description: Digits are rearranged between input and output.
  - type: rotation
    description: The output grid appears to be a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input grid.
  - type: conservation
    description: The set of digits present in the input is identical to the set of digits in the output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observe:** Treat the input as a 2D grid of digits.
2.  **Rotate:** Rotate the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise.
3.  **Preserve**: Ensure the digits themselves do not change.
4.  **Output:** The rotated grid is the output.

In simpler terms, the transformation rule is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input grid.
