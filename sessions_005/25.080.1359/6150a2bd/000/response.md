Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on identifying the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of single-digit integers, likely representing colors.
*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical within each pair, but different between the pairs.
*   The arrangement of the numbers changes from input to output. The numbers themselves seem mostly conserved (e.g., two 3's in input and two 3's in output of first example), suggesting a rearrangement/remapping rather than calculation.
* The output grid appears to be a rotated or mirrored version of the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task_description:
  task_type: rearrangement
  objects:
    - type: grid
      properties:
        - dimensions: variable (but same input vs. output)
        - elements: single-digit integers (colors)
  actions:
    - name: rotate_and_mirror
      description: The input grid appears to be rotated and/or mirrored to produce the output grid. Specifically, it seems like a counter-clockwise rotation by 90 degrees plus transposing rows and columns.
  relationships:
    - input_output: "The output grid is a transformed version of the input grid, preserving dimensions and element values, but rearranging element positions."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Receive a 2D grid of integers.
2.  **Transformation:** Rotate the input grid counter-clockwise by 90 degrees. And then, transpose/swap rows and columns. Another way to think of it is a reflection across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right), and change from row-major to column-major ordering.
3.  **Output:** Return the transformed 2D grid.

In short, the transformation is a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation, followed by a transposition. Or, equivalently, a reflection over the main diagonal.
