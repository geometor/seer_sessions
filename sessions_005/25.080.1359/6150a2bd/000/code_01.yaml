  task_type: rearrangement
  objects:
    - type: grid
      properties:
        - dimensions: variable (but same input vs. output)
        - elements: single-digit integers (colors)
  actions:
    - name: rotate_and_mirror
      description: The input grid appears to be rotated and/or mirrored to produce the output grid. Specifically, it seems like a counter-clockwise rotation by 90 degrees plus transposing rows and columns.
  relationships:
    - input_output: "The output grid is a transformed version of the input grid, preserving dimensions and element values, but rearranging element positions."
