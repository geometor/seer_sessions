"""
Iterate through each pixel in the input grid. If a pixel is white (0) and it has a blue (1) pixel immediately to its left and a blue (1) pixel immediately to its right within the same row, change that white pixel to red (2) in the output grid. Otherwise, the pixel retains its original color. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
