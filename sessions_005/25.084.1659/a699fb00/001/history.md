Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels. The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid.
2.  **Colors:** The input grids contain only white (0) and blue (1) pixels. The output grids contain white (0), blue (1), and red (2) pixels.
3.  **Changes:** Some white pixels in the input grid are changed to red pixels in the output grid. Blue pixels remain blue, and most white pixels remain white.
4.  **Pattern:** The change from white to red occurs specifically for white pixels that are situated horizontally directly between two blue pixels. Looking at `train_1`, row 1 has the pattern `1 0 1 0 1 0 1`, which becomes `1 2 1 2 1 2 1`. The white pixels at `(1,2)`, `(1,4)`, and `(1,6)` change to red because they each have a blue pixel immediately to their left and right. The white pixel at `(1,8)` does not change because it only has a blue pixel to its left. This pattern `1 0 1` becoming `1 2 1` is consistent across all examples and all occurrences within each example.
5.  **Scope:** The transformation appears local, depending only on the pixel itself and its immediate horizontal neighbors. Vertical or diagonal relationships do not seem relevant.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  - type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  - colors_input: [white (0), blue (1)]
  - colors_output: [white (0), blue (1), red (2)]
  - dimensions: unchanged between input and output
Transformation:
  - type: pixel color change based on local pattern
  - target_pixel: white (0)
  - condition:
      - must have a left neighbor
      - left neighbor must be blue (1)
      - must have a right neighbor
      - right neighbor must be blue (1)
  - action_if_condition_met: change target_pixel color to red (2)
  - action_if_condition_unmet: keep original color
  - scope: applies independently to each pixel meeting the criteria
  - context: horizontal adjacency within the same row
Objects:
  - name: blue_pixel
    color: 1
    role: trigger for transformation
  - name: white_pixel
    color: 0
    role: potential target for transformation
  - name: red_pixel
    color: 2
    role: result of transformation
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially copying all pixel values from the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid from top to bottom.
3.  Within each row, iterate through each pixel from left to right, specifically focusing on columns from the second position up to the second-to-last position (index 1 to width-2).
4.  For each pixel at position `(row, col)`:
    a.  Check if the pixel at `(row, col)` in the input grid is white (0).
    b.  Check if the pixel immediately to its left, at `(row, col-1)`, is blue (1).
    c.  Check if the pixel immediately to its right, at `(row, col+1)`, is blue (1).
    d.  If all three conditions (a, b, and c) are true, update the color of the pixel at `(row, col)` in the new grid to red (2).
5.  Return the modified new grid as the output.
