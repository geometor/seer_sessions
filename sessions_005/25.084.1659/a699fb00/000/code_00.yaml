Grid:
  - type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  - colors_input: [white (0), blue (1)]
  - colors_output: [white (0), blue (1), red (2)]
  - dimensions: unchanged between input and output
Transformation:
  - type: pixel color change based on local pattern
  - target_pixel: white (0)
  - condition:
      - must have a left neighbor
      - left neighbor must be blue (1)
      - must have a right neighbor
      - right neighbor must be blue (1)
  - action_if_condition_met: change target_pixel color to red (2)
  - action_if_condition_unmet: keep original color
  - scope: applies independently to each pixel meeting the criteria
  - context: horizontal adjacency within the same row
Objects:
  - name: blue_pixel
    color: 1
    role: trigger for transformation
  - name: white_pixel
    color: 0
    role: potential target for transformation
  - name: red_pixel
    color: 2
    role: result of transformation
