            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels. The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid.\n2.  **Colors:** The input grids contain only white (0) and blue (1) pixels. The output grids contain white (0), blue (1), and red (2) pixels.\n3.  **Changes:** Some white pixels in the input grid are changed to red pixels in the output grid. Blue pixels remain blue, and most white pixels remain white.\n4.  **Pattern:** The change from white to red occurs specifically for white pixels that are situated horizontally directly between two blue pixels. Looking at `train_1`, row 1 has the pattern `1 0 1 0 1 0 1`, which becomes `1 2 1 2 1 2 1`. The white pixels at `(1,2)`, `(1,4)`, and `(1,6)` change to red because they each have a blue pixel immediately to their left and right. The white pixel at `(1,8)` does not change because it only has a blue pixel to its left. This pattern `1 0 1` becoming `1 2 1` is consistent across all examples and all occurrences within each example.\n5.  **Scope:** The transformation appears local, depending only on the pixel itself and its immediate horizontal neighbors. Vertical or diagonal relationships do not seem relevant.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Check if the pixel immediately to its left, at `(row, col-1)`, is blue (1).\n    c.  Check if the pixel immediately to its right, at `(row, col+1)`, is blue (1).\n    d.  If all three conditions (a, b, and c) are true, update the color of the pixel at `(row, col)` in the new grid to red (2).\n5.  Return the modified new grid as the output."
