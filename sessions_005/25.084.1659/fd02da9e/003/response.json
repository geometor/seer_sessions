Identify the single non-orange pixel (the \"marker pixel\") in the 8x8 input grid. Record its color and its coordinates (row, col).\n3. Determine if the marker pixel is in a 'top' corner (row = 0) or a 'bottom' corner (row = 7).\n4. Based on the marker pixel's specific corner location and whether it's a 'top' or 'bottom' corner, calculate the coordinates for a set of pixels to be drawn on the output grid using the marker pixel's color:\n    - If the marker is at the top-left (0, 0), calculate coordinates relative to the marker: (+1,+1), (+1,+2), (+2,+1), (+2,+2).\n    - If the marker is at the top-right (0, 7), calculate coordinates relative to the marker: (+1,-2), (+1,-1), (+2,-2), (+2,-1).\n    - If the marker is at the bottom-left (7, 0), calculate coordinates relative to the marker: (-3,+2), (-2,+2), (-1,+3).\n    - If the marker is at the bottom-right (7, 7), calculate coordinates relative to the marker: (-3,-2), (-2,-2), (-1,-3).\n5.
