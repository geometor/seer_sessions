Determine which corner the marker pixel occupies:\n        *   If `(row, col)` is `(0, 0)`, it's the top-left corner.\n        *   If `(row, col)` is `(0, 7)`, it's the top-right corner.\n        *   If `(row, col)` is `(7, 0)`, it's the bottom-left corner.\n        *   If `(row, col)` is `(7, 7)`, it's the bottom-right corner.\n    3.  Create a new 8x8 output grid filled entirely with orange (7).\n    4.  Based on the identified corner, draw a specific 3-pixel shape using the marker pixel's color onto the output grid at coordinates relative to the original marker pixel's location `(row, col)`:\n        *   If the corner was top-left `(0, 0)`, draw pixels at `(row+1, col+1)`, `(row+1, col+2)`, and `(row+2, col+1)`.\n        *   If the corner was top-right `(0, 7)`, draw pixels at `(row+1, col-2)`, `(row+1, col-1)`, and `(row+2, col-1)`.\n        *   If the corner was bottom-left `(7, 0)`, draw pixels at `(row-3, col+2)`, `(row-2, col+2)`, and `(row-1, col+3)`.\n        *   If the corner was bottom-right `(7, 7)`, draw pixels at `(row-3, col-2)`, `(row-2, col-2)`, and `(row-1, col-3)`.\n    5.
