task_context:
  grid_properties:
    size: [8, 8] # height, width
    background_color: 7 # orange
  input_features:
    - object_type: marker_pixel
      count: 1
      description: A single pixel with a color different from the background.
      properties:
        color: Any color except orange (7).
        location: Always one of the four corners (0,0), (0,7), (7,0), or (7,7).
  output_features:
    - object_type: background
      properties:
        color: 7 # orange
        size: [8, 8]
    - object_type: output_shape
      count: 1
      description: A small shape drawn onto the background.
      properties:
        color: Same as the input marker_pixel color.
        structure: Depends on the marker_pixel location.
        location: Relative to the marker_pixel location.

actions:
  - name: identify_marker
    input: input_grid
    output: marker_pixel (color, row, col)
    description: Find the single non-orange pixel and its properties.

  - name: determine_corner_type
    input: marker_pixel_row
    output: corner_type ('top' or 'bottom')
    description: Check if the marker is in row 0 (top) or row 7 (bottom).

  - name: create_base_output
    output: output_grid
    description: Create an 8x8 grid filled with orange (7).

  - name: draw_shape
    input: [output_grid, marker_pixel, corner_type]
    output: modified_output_grid
    description: >
      Draw the appropriate shape onto the output grid using the marker_pixel color
      at a specific location relative to the marker_pixel position, based on the corner_type.
      - If corner_type is 'top' (row 0): Draw a 2x2 square.
        - If marker is at (0,0), square uses relative offsets (+1,+1), (+1,+2), (+2,+1), (+2,+2).
        - If marker is at (0,7), square uses relative offsets (+1,-2), (+1,-1), (+2,-2), (+2,-1).
      - If corner_type is 'bottom' (row 7): Draw a 3-pixel shape.
        - If marker is at (7,0), shape uses relative offsets (-3,+2), (-2,+2), (-1,+3).
        - If marker is at (7,7), shape uses relative offsets (-3,-2), (-2,-2), (-1,-3).
