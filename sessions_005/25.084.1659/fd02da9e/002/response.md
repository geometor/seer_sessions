## General Assessment

The previous code successfully identified the core mechanism: locating a single "marker" pixel in one of the four corners of the input grid and drawing a shape of the same color on an otherwise orange background in the output grid. The code correctly handled the bottom-left and bottom-right corner cases.

However, the code failed for the top-left and top-right corner cases (Examples 4 and 2, respectively). The analysis revealed that the shapes expected for the top corners are different from those for the bottom corners. Specifically, the top corners require a 2x2 square to be drawn, whereas the bottom corners require a specific 3-pixel asymmetric shape. The previous code incorrectly assumed the same 3-pixel shape logic applied to all corners, leading to the discrepancies.

The strategy for resolution is to modify the transformation logic to differentiate between top and bottom corners and draw the correct shape (either a 2x2 square or the specific 3-pixel shape) based on the marker pixel's row coordinate.

## Metrics and Observations

All input and output grids are 8x8.
The background color is consistently orange (7).
Each input grid contains exactly one non-orange pixel, located in one of the four corners.
The output grid consists of an orange background with a small shape drawn using the color of the input marker pixel.

**Example 1 (Bottom-Left):**
*   Input Marker: Blue (1) at (7, 0).
*   Output Shape: Blue (1) pixels at (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 3). Relative coords: (-3, +2), (-2, +2), (-1, +3).
*   Code Result: Match.

**Example 2 (Top-Right):**
*   Input Marker: Azure (8) at (0, 7).
*   Expected Output Shape: Azure (8) pixels at (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6). A 2x2 square. Relative coords: (+1, -2), (+1, -1), (+2, -2), (+2, -1).
*   Transformed Output Shape: Azure (8) pixels at (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6). Missing pixel at (2, 5).
*   Code Result: Failure (1 pixel off).

**Example 3 (Bottom-Right):**
*   Input Marker: White (0) at (7, 7).
*   Output Shape: White (0) pixels at (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 4). Relative coords: (-3, -2), (-2, -2), (-1, -3).
*   Code Result: Match.

**Example 4 (Top-Left):**
*   Input Marker: Maroon (9) at (0, 0).
*   Expected Output Shape: Maroon (9) pixels at (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2). A 2x2 square. Relative coords: (+1, +1), (+1, +2), (+2, +1), (+2, +2).
*   Transformed Output Shape: Maroon (9) pixels at (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1). Missing pixel at (2, 2).
*   Code Result: Failure (1 pixel off).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an 8x8 output grid filled entirely with orange (7).
2.  Identify the single non-orange pixel (the "marker pixel") in the 8x8 input grid. Record its color and its coordinates (row, col).
3.  Determine if the marker pixel is in a 'top' corner (row = 0) or a 'bottom' corner (row = 7).
4.  Based on the marker pixel's specific corner location and whether it's a 'top' or 'bottom' corner, calculate the coordinates for a set of pixels to be drawn on the output grid using the marker pixel's color:
    *   If the marker is at the **top-left (0, 0)**, calculate coordinates relative to the marker: (+1,+1), (+1,+2), (+2,+1), (+2,+2).
    *   If the marker is at the **top-right (0, 7)**, calculate coordinates relative to the marker: (+1,-2), (+1,-1), (+2,-2), (+2,-1).
    *   If the marker is at the **bottom-left (7, 0)**, calculate coordinates relative to the marker: (-3,+2), (-2,+2), (-1,+3).
    *   If the marker is at the **bottom-right (7, 7)**, calculate coordinates relative to the marker: (-3,-2), (-2,-2), (-1,-3).
5.  Change the color of the calculated pixels on the output grid to the marker pixel's color.
6.  The resulting grid is the final output.
