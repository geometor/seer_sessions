Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A small grid containing mostly white pixels (0) and one or more non-white pixels (objects). The non-white pixels have various colors (yellow, gray, red, magenta) across the examples.
*   **Output Grid:** A larger grid, specifically 3 times the height and 3 times the width of the input grid.
*   **Tiling:** The output grid appears to be constructed by tiling the input grid in a 3x3 pattern. The original non-white pixels from the input are replicated in each tile.
*   **Enhancement:** Around each replicated non-white pixel in the output grid, additional pixels are added:
    *   Blue (1) pixels appear immediately to the left and right.
    *   Green (3) pixels appear diagonally (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).
*   **Overwriting Rule:** The new blue and green pixels only appear if the target cell in the tiled grid is currently white (0). They do not overwrite existing non-white pixels from the tiled input or other newly added pixels.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  color_palette: 0-9 (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta)
input_characteristics:
  size: variable height (H_in) and width (W_in)
  content: mostly white (0) with sparse non-white pixels (objects)
output_characteristics:
  size: 3 * H_in height, 3 * W_in width
  content: combination of original input patterns and newly added pixels
transformation_steps:
  - name: tiling
    input: input grid
    output_dimensions: (3 * H_in, 3 * W_in)
    pattern: 3x3 repetition of the input grid
    details: The input grid is copied 9 times to fill the output grid.
  - name: enhancement
    target_pixels: non-white pixels present in the tiled grid (originating from the input)
    added_pixels:
      - color: blue (1)
        relative_position: horizontal neighbors (left, right)
      - color: green (3)
        relative_position: diagonal neighbors (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)
    condition: Add blue/green pixels only if the target cell in the tiled grid is white (0).
relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions are directly proportional (3x) to the input grid dimensions.
  - Each non-white pixel in the input corresponds to 9 identical pixels in the initial tiled output grid.
  - The placement of blue and green pixels is relative to the position of each non-white pixel from the original input, replicated across the tiles.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input grid. Let its height be H_in and width be W_in.
2.  Create a new output grid with height 3 * H_in and width 3 * W_in.
3.  Tile the input grid onto the output grid in a 3x3 arrangement. To do this, for each cell (r, c) in the input grid, copy its color value to the output grid cells at (r, c), (r, c + W_in), (r, c + 2*W_in), (r + H_in, c), (r + H_in, c + W_in), (r + H_in, c + 2*W_in), (r + 2*H_in, c), (r + 2*H_in, c + W_in), and (r + 2*H_in, c + 2*W_in).
4.  Create a final grid, initially identical to the tiled grid created in step 3.
5.  Iterate through each cell (R, C) of the tiled grid (from step 3).
6.  If the cell (R, C) in the tiled grid contains a non-white color (i.e., its value is not 0):
    a.  Check the cell to the left: (R, C-1). If this position is within the grid boundaries and the cell at (R, C-1) in the *final* grid is currently white (0), change the color of cell (R, C-1) in the final grid to blue (1).
    b.  Check the cell to the right: (R, C+1). If this position is within the grid boundaries and the cell at (R, C+1) in the *final* grid is currently white (0), change the color of cell (R, C+1) in the final grid to blue (1).
    c.  Check the cell top-left: (R-1, C-1). If this position is within the grid boundaries and the cell at (R-1, C-1) in the *final* grid is currently white (0), change the color of cell (R-1, C-1) in the final grid to green (3).
    d.  Check the cell top-right: (R-1, C+1). If this position is within the grid boundaries and the cell at (R-1, C+1) in the *final* grid is currently white (0), change the color of cell (R-1, C+1) in the final grid to green (3).
    e.  Check the cell bottom-left: (R+1, C-1). If this position is within the grid boundaries and the cell at (R+1, C-1) in the *final* grid is currently white (0), change the color of cell (R+1, C-1) in the final grid to green (3).
    f.  Check the cell bottom-right: (R+1, C+1). If this position is within the grid boundaries and the cell at (R+1, C+1) in the *final* grid is currently white (0), change the color of cell (R+1, C+1) in the final grid to green (3).
7.  The resulting final grid is the output.
