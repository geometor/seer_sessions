task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  color_palette: 0-9 (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta)
input_characteristics:
  size: variable height (H_in) and width (W_in)
  content: mostly white (0) with sparse non-white pixels (objects)
output_characteristics:
  size: 3 * H_in height, 3 * W_in width
  content: combination of original input patterns and newly added pixels
transformation_steps:
  - name: tiling
    input: input grid
    output_dimensions: (3 * H_in, 3 * W_in)
    pattern: 3x3 repetition of the input grid
    details: The input grid is copied 9 times to fill the output grid.
  - name: enhancement
    target_pixels: non-white pixels present in the tiled grid (originating from the input)
    added_pixels:
      - color: blue (1)
        relative_position: horizontal neighbors (left, right)
      - color: green (3)
        relative_position: diagonal neighbors (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)
    condition: Add blue/green pixels only if the target cell in the tiled grid is white (0).
relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions are directly proportional (3x) to the input grid dimensions.
  - Each non-white pixel in the input corresponds to 9 identical pixels in the initial tiled output grid.
  - The placement of blue and green pixels is relative to the position of each non-white pixel from the original input, replicated across the tiles.
