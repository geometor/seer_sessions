Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.\n2. Iterate through each row (r) and column (c) of the *input* grid.\n3. If the pixel at (r, c) in the *input* grid is not white (color is not 0):\n    a. Let the color of this pixel be original_color. This is a \"trigger pixel\".\n    b. Iterate through the columns c_new in the *output* grid, starting from c + 1 to the last column index.\n    c. Calculate the horizontal distance: distance = c_new - c.\n    d. Determine the color to place at (r, c_new) in the *output* grid:\n        i. If the distance is odd, set the color to gray (5).\n        ii. If the distance is even, set the color to the original_color of the trigger pixel.\n    e. Update the pixel at (r, c_new) in the *output* grid with the determined color.\n4.
