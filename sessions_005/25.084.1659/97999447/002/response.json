Examine the *input* grid row by row, column by column.\n3.  If you find a pixel in the *input* grid that is *not* white (color 0), remember its row (`r`), column (`c`), and original color (`original_color`). This is a \"trigger pixel\".\n4.  For this trigger pixel, look at the pixels in the *output* grid in the same row (`r`), starting from the column immediately to the right (`c + 1`) and going all the way to the right edge of the grid.\n5.  For each of these pixels at column `c_new`:\n    a.  Calculate the horizontal distance from the trigger pixel: `distance = c_new - c`.\n    b.  If the `distance` is an odd number (1, 3, 5, ...), change the color of the pixel at (`r`, `c_new`) in the *output* grid to gray (5).\n    c.  If the `distance` is an even number (2, 4, 6, ...), change the color of the pixel at (`r`, `c_new`) in the *output* grid to the `original_color` of the trigger pixel.\n6.  Repeat steps 3-5 for all non-white pixels found in the *input* grid.\n7.  The final state of the output grid is the result.**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided information includes the previous code, the results of running it on the training examples (input, expected output, transformed output, and comparison metrics), and instructions for refinement. The core issue identified is that the previous code modifies the grid it is iterating over to find triggers, causing newly placed gray pixels to incorrectly initiate new patterns. The transformed outputs consistently show the correct initial gray pixel next to the trigger pixel, but subsequent pixels are overwritten incorrectly, usually resulting in a sequence of gray pixels instead of the required alternating pattern.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the logic by ensuring that only the non-white pixels present in the *original input grid* act as triggers for generating the horizontal patterns. The patterns should then be drawn onto a separate *output grid* (initialized as a copy of the input).\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe code execution performed confirms the following:\n1.  **Trigger Pixels:** The non-white pixels in the input grids are correctly identified.\n    *   Example 1: (1, 2, color 2), (4, 1, color 3), (5, 6, color 6)\n    *   Example 2: (2, 2, color 2), (5, 3, color 6)\n    *   Example 3: (3, 3, color 8)\n2.  **Pattern Generation:** The proposed corrected logic (calculating distance from the original trigger and alternating between gray (5) for odd distances and the trigger's original color for even distances) successfully generates the exact sequence of pixels seen in the `Expected Output` for the rightward extension of each trigger pixel in all three examples.\n3.  **Error Source:** The analysis confirms the hypothesis that the error in the previous code stems from reading and writing to the same grid during iteration, causing interference between patterns generated from original pixels and modifications made during the process.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
