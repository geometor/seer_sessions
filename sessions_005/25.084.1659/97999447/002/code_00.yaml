task_description: Draw horizontal alternating patterns extending rightwards from non-white pixels found in the input grid.
grid_properties:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Background color is white (0).
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Any color other than white (1-9).
      - role: trigger pixel
actions:
  - name: find_triggers
    input: input_grid
    output: list of coordinates and colors of non-white pixels.
    description: Iterate through the input grid. If a pixel's color is not white (0), record its row, column, and color.
  - name: draw_pattern
    input: output_grid, trigger_pixel (row, column, color)
    output: modified output_grid
    description: |
      For a given trigger pixel at (r, c) with original_color:
      1. Iterate through columns c_new from c + 1 to the right edge of the grid.
      2. Calculate the horizontal distance: distance = c_new - c.
      3. If distance is odd, set the pixel at (r, c_new) in the output_grid to gray (5).
      4. If distance is even, set the pixel at (r, c_new) in the output_grid to the original_color.
process:
  - Initialize the output_grid as a copy of the input_grid.
  - Find all trigger pixels in the input_grid.
  - For each trigger pixel found:
    - Apply the draw_pattern action to the output_grid using the trigger pixel's coordinates and color.
  - Return the final output_grid.
