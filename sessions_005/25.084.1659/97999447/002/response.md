The code execution confirms that the revised logic (reading triggers from the input grid and writing the pattern to the output grid) correctly generates the expected patterns for all trigger pixels in all examples.

**YAML Facts:**

    description: |
      For a given trigger pixel at (r, c) with original_color:
      1. Iterate through columns c_new from c + 1 to the right edge of the grid.
      2. Calculate the horizontal distance: distance = c_new - c.
      3. If distance is odd, set the pixel at (r, c_new) in the output_grid to gray (5).
      4. If distance is even, set the pixel at (r, c_new) in the output_grid to the original_color.
process:
  - Initialize the output_grid as a copy of the input_grid.
  - Find all trigger pixels in the input_grid.
  - For each trigger pixel found:
    - Apply the draw_pattern action to the output_grid using the trigger pixel's coordinates and color.
  - Return the final output_grid.
```


**Refined Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid (the output grid) that is an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Examine the *input* grid row by row, column by column.
3.  If you find a pixel in the *input* grid that is *not* white (color 0), remember its row (`r`), column (`c`), and original color (`original_color`). This is a "trigger pixel".
4.  For this trigger pixel, look at the pixels in the *output* grid in the same row (`r`), starting from the column immediately to the right (`c + 1`) and going all the way to the right edge of the grid.
5.  For each of these pixels at column `c_new`:
    a.  Calculate the horizontal distance from the trigger pixel: `distance = c_new - c`.
    b.  If the `distance` is an odd number (1, 3, 5, ...), change the color of the pixel at (`r`, `c_new`) in the *output* grid to gray (5).
    c.  If the `distance` is an even number (2, 4, 6, ...), change the color of the pixel at (`r`, `c_new`) in the *output* grid to the `original_color` of the trigger pixel.
6.  Repeat steps 3-5 for all non-white pixels found in the *input* grid.
7.  The final state of the output grid is the result.**General Assessment:**

The provided information includes the previous code, the results of running it on the training examples (input, expected output, transformed output, and comparison metrics), and instructions for refinement. The core issue identified is that the previous code modifies the grid it is iterating over to find triggers, causing newly placed gray pixels to incorrectly initiate new patterns. The transformed outputs consistently show the correct initial gray pixel next to the trigger pixel, but subsequent pixels are overwritten incorrectly, usually resulting in a sequence of gray pixels instead of the required alternating pattern.

The strategy is to correct the logic by ensuring that only the non-white pixels present in the *original input grid* act as triggers for generating the horizontal patterns. The patterns should then be drawn onto a separate *output grid* (initialized as a copy of the input).

**Metrics:**

The code execution performed confirms the following:
1.  **Trigger Pixels:** The non-white pixels in the input grids are correctly identified.
    *   Example 1: (1, 2, color 2), (4, 1, color 3), (5, 6, color 6)
    *   Example 2: (2, 2, color 2), (5, 3, color 6)
    *   Example 3: (3, 3, color 8)
2.  **Pattern Generation:** The proposed corrected logic (calculating distance from the original trigger and alternating between gray (5) for odd distances and the trigger's original color for even distances) successfully generates the exact sequence of pixels seen in the `Expected Output` for the rightward extension of each trigger pixel in all three examples.
3.  **Error Source:** The analysis confirms the hypothesis that the error in the previous code stems from reading and writing to the same grid during iteration, causing interference between patterns generated from original pixels and modifications made during the process.

task_description: Draw horizontal alternating patterns extending rightwards from non-white pixels found in the input grid.

      Iterate column_new from trigger_pixel.column + 1 to the grid width.
      Calculate distance = column_new - trigger_pixel.column.
      If distance is odd, set output_grid[trigger_pixel.row, column_new] = 5 (gray).

  - Execute find_triggers on input_grid to get a list of all trigger_pixels.
  - For each trigger_pixel in the list:
      Execute draw_pattern, updating the output_grid.
  - Return the final output_grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid exactly.
2.  Identify all locations (`r`, `c`) in the **input** grid that contain a non-white pixel (color is not 0). Store the location (`r`, `c`) and the color (`original_color`) for each of these trigger pixels.
3.  For each identified trigger pixel at (`r`, `c`) with `original_color`:
    a.  Iterate through the columns `c_new` starting from `c + 1` up to the last column index of the grid.
    b.  Calculate the horizontal distance `d = c_new - c`.
    c.  If `d` is odd (1, 3, 5, ...), set the pixel at (`r`, `c_new`) in the **output** grid to gray (color 5).
    d.  If `d` is even (2, 4, 6, ...), set the pixel at (`r`, `c_new`) in the **output** grid to the `original_color`.
4.  After processing all trigger pixels found in step 2, return the modified output grid.
