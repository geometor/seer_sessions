Previous Code:
```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by finding non-white pixels and extending a horizontal pattern to their right.

    1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2. Iterate through each row (r) and column (c) of the input grid.
    3. If the pixel at (r, c) is not white (color is not 0):
        a. Let the color of this pixel be original_color.
        b. Iterate through the columns c_new from c + 1 to the last column index of the grid.
        c. Determine the color to place at (r, c_new):
            i. If the horizontal distance (c_new - c) is odd, set the color to gray (5).
            ii. If the horizontal distance (c_new - c) is even, set the color to original_color.
        d. Update the pixel at (r, c_new) in the output grid with the determined color.
    4. Return the final output grid.
