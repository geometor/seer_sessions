Red pixels appear as single points, also potentially acting as boundaries.\n    *   The transformation seems to involve identifying regions of white pixels. Specifically, it differentiates between white pixels that are \"enclosed\" by the blue and red pixels (and the grid edges) and those that are \"outside\" or connected to the grid's boundary.\n    *   The white pixels identified as \"enclosed\" are changed to yellow (4). The \"outside\" white pixels remain white (0).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
