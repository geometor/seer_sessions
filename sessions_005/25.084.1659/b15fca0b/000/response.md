*   **Perception:**
    *   The task involves transforming a grid based on the spatial relationship between pixels of different colors.
    *   The input grids contain white (0), blue (1), and red (2) pixels.
    *   The output grids contain the original blue (1) and red (2) pixels, while some white (0) pixels are changed to yellow (4), and others remain white (0).
    *   Blue pixels often form lines or boundaries. Red pixels appear as single points, also potentially acting as boundaries.
    *   The transformation seems to involve identifying regions of white pixels. Specifically, it differentiates between white pixels that are "enclosed" by the blue and red pixels (and the grid edges) and those that are "outside" or connected to the grid's boundary.
    *   The white pixels identified as "enclosed" are changed to yellow (4). The "outside" white pixels remain white (0).

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    input_colors: [0, 1, 2] # white, blue, red
    output_colors: [0, 1, 2, 4] # white, blue, red, yellow
    key_objects:
      - type: boundary_pixels
        colors: [1, 2] # blue, red
        description: These pixels, along with the grid edges, define boundaries.
      - type: background_pixels
        color: 0 # white
        description: These pixels may either remain unchanged or be filled.
      - type: filled_pixels
        color: 4 # yellow
        description: These pixels appear in the output, replacing some background pixels.

        description: Groups of adjacent (including diagonal) white pixels form regions.
      - property: boundary_relation
        value: reachability_from_edge
        description: Regions are classified based on whether they can reach the grid edge without crossing boundary pixels.
    actions:
      - action: identify_outside_regions
        input: grid, boundary_colors
        output: set_of_outside_white_pixel_coordinates
        description: Find all white pixels connected (adjacency including diagonals) to any edge pixel of the grid, without passing through a blue (1) or red (2) pixel.
      - action: fill_inside_regions
        input: grid, set_of_outside_white_pixel_coordinates
        output: modified_grid
        description: Change the color of all white (0) pixels that are *not* in the 'outside' set to yellow (4).
      - action: preserve_pixels
        input: grid
        output: modified_grid
        description: Keep all blue (1), red (2), and 'outside' white (0) pixels unchanged.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Define the "boundary" colors as blue (1) and red (2).
    3.  Identify all white (0) pixels located at the edges (top, bottom, left, right) of the input grid. Add these to a "reachable" set and a queue for processing.
    4.  Perform a flood-fill (or breadth-first search) starting from the initial edge pixels:
        *   While the queue is not empty, dequeue a white pixel coordinate.
        *   For each of its 8 neighbors (adjacent and diagonal):
            *   If the neighbor is within the grid boundaries, is white (0), and has not already been added to the "reachable" set:
                *   Add the neighbor's coordinate to the "reachable" set.
                *   Enqueue the neighbor's coordinate.
    5.  Iterate through every pixel coordinate (row, column) in the input grid.
    6.  If the pixel at the current coordinate in the input grid is white (0) AND its coordinate is NOT in the "reachable" set, change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to yellow (4).
    7.  All other pixels in the output grid (boundary colors, and white pixels in the "reachable" set) retain their original colors from the input grid.
    8.  Return the modified output grid.
