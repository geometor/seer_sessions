Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2. Define boundary colors: blue (1) and red (2).\n3. Find all white (0) pixels connected to the grid edges using a flood fill (BFS) algorithm, considering diagonal adjacency. These are the 'outside' or 'reachable' white pixels. Store their coordinates.\n4. Iterate through the grid. If a pixel is white (0) and its coordinates were *not* found in the 'reachable' set from step 3, change its color to yellow (4) in the output grid.\n5.
