objects:
  - object: gray_bar
    description: A vertical bar composed of gray (5) pixels located exclusively in column 0.
    properties:
      - vertical_span: The range of rows occupied by the gray bar (min_row to max_row). Determined by finding the minimum and maximum row indices of gray pixels in column 0.
  - object: pattern_block
    description: A rectangular region of the input grid used for replication.
    properties:
      - source_rows: Identical to the vertical_span of the gray_bar.
      - source_columns: All columns starting from column 1 to the last column of the grid.
      - content: The pixel values from the input grid within the defined source_rows and source_columns.
      - height: (max_row of gray_bar) - (min_row of gray_bar) + 1.
  - object: original_content
    description: All non-white (0) and non-gray (5) pixels present in the input grid.
    properties:
      - max_row: The highest row index occupied by any pixel belonging to this set.
  - object: target_area
    description: The portion of the grid below the original_content where the pattern_block is replicated.
    properties:
      - start_row: (max_row of original_content) + 1.
      - columns: Same as the source_columns of the pattern_block (column 1 onwards).
      - end_row: The last row of the grid.

actions:
  - action: identify_gray_bar_span
    description: Find the minimum and maximum row indices containing gray (5) pixels in column 0.
  - action: extract_pattern_block
    description: Select the rectangular region of the input grid defined by the gray_bar's vertical_span and columns 1 through the width of the grid.
  - action: determine_replication_start
    description: Find the maximum row index containing any non-white (0) and non-gray (5) pixel in the input grid. The replication starts on the next row.
  - action: replicate_pattern
    description: >
      Copy the pattern_block repeatedly into the target_area. The first copy starts at the
      target_area's start_row. Each subsequent copy starts immediately below the
      previous one (start_row + N * pattern_height). Copying stops if the pattern
      would start beyond the grid's height. If a copy partially extends beyond the
      grid boundary, only the portion that fits is copied. The replication occurs
      only in the columns corresponding to the pattern_block (column 1 onwards).
      Column 0 remains unchanged from the input.
