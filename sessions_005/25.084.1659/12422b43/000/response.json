All examples feature a distinct vertical gray bar on the leftmost column, which seems to act as an anchor or selector. The objects to be replicated are colored shapes (non-white, non-gray) that are adjacent to this gray bar. The replication process involves copying the horizontal rows containing these selected objects downwards, repeating the pattern until the bottom of the grid is reached or filled. The original content, including the gray bar and the initial set of objects, remains in the output grid.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "

Group contiguous pixels of the same color into objects.\n    4.  Select the objects that have at least one pixel adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any pixel of the gray bar in column 0.\n    5.  If no objects are selected, return the unchanged input grid.\n    6.  Determine the minimum row index (`min_row_sel`) and the maximum row index (`max_row_sel`) occupied by any pixel belonging to any of the selected objects.\n    7.  Define the \"pattern block\" as the rectangular region of the *input* grid spanning rows `min_row_sel` to `max_row_sel` and columns 1 to the last column.\n    8.  Determine the maximum row index (`max_row_orig`) occupied by any non-white (0), non-gray (5) pixel in the entire input grid.\n    9.  Set the starting row for the first copy, `current_dest_row`, to `max_row_orig + 1`.\n    10. Calculate the height of the pattern block: `pattern_height = max_row_sel - min_row_sel + 1`.\n    11.
