Transformation Rule:

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the pixels belonging to the gray (5) vertical bar in the first column (column 0).
3.  Find all colored pixels (not white 0 and not gray 5) in the input grid.
4.  Identify which of these colored pixels are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any pixel of the gray bar.
5.  If no colored pixels are adjacent to the gray bar, return the unchanged input grid copy.
6.  Determine the minimum (`min_row_sel`) and maximum (`max_row_sel`) row indices spanned by these adjacent colored pixels.
7.  Define the "pattern block" as the rectangular region of the *input* grid covering rows from `min_row_sel` to `max_row_sel` and all columns *except* the first one (column 0).
8.  Determine the maximum row index (`max_row_orig`) occupied by any non-white (0), non-gray (5) pixel in the *entire* input grid.
9.  Set the starting destination row for copying the pattern, `current_dest_row`, to be `max_row_orig + 1`.
10. Calculate the height of the pattern block.
11. Repeatedly copy the pattern block vertically downwards into the output grid, starting at `current_dest_row`. Each subsequent copy starts immediately below the previous one. Copying stops when the bottom of the grid is reached. If a copy would extend beyond the grid boundary, only the part that fits within the grid is copied.
12. Return the modified output grid.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the transformation rule.

**1. General Assessment**

The provided code consistently failed across all training examples, including the one it was derived from. The core issue appears to be the misidentification of the "pattern block" that needs to be replicated. The initial hypothesis relied on finding colored pixels adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to the gray bar in the first column. However, the code's output (no replication occurred) and the expected outputs suggest this adjacency definition is incorrect or insufficient.

Specifically, the `adjacent_colored_pixels` set was likely empty in the code's execution, leading it to bypass the replication step (Step 4 in the code's logic: `if not adjacent_colored_pixels: return output_grid`).

A review of all examples against their expected outputs suggests a different rule for defining the pattern:

*   A vertical gray bar exists in the first column (column 0).
*   The pattern to be replicated seems to correspond to the portion of the input grid *to the right* of the gray bar (i.e., columns 1 onwards) that spans the *same rows* as the gray bar itself.
*   This pattern is then replicated vertically downwards, starting immediately below the lowest row containing any non-white, non-gray pixel in the original input.

The strategy is to:
1.  Verify this new hypothesis by gathering metrics for each example.
2.  Update the documentation (Facts and Natural Language Program) based on this revised understanding.

**2. Gather Metrics**

Let's analyze each example based on the new hypothesis: The pattern is defined by the row span of the gray bar in column 0, applied to columns 1 onwards. Replication starts below the max row of original non-white, non-gray content.

Example 2 Metrics: {'shape': (8, 7), 'gray_bar': {'min_row': 0, 'max_row': 2}, 'pattern_rows': (0, 2), 'pattern_shape': (3, 6), 'max_row_orig_content': 4, 'replication_start_row': 5}
Example 3 Metrics: {'shape': (9, 7), 'gray_bar': {'min_row': 0, 'max_row': 1}, 'pattern_rows': (0, 1), 'pattern_shape': (2, 6), 'max_row_orig_content': 4, 'replication_start_row': 5}
Example 4 Metrics: {'shape': (7, 6), 'gray_bar': {'min_row': 0, 'max_row': 0}, 'pattern_rows': (0, 0), 'pattern_shape': (1, 5), 'max_row_orig_content': 1, 'replication_start_row': 2}
Example 5 Metrics: {'shape': (5, 5), 'gray_bar': {'min_row': 0, 'max_row': 1}, 'pattern_rows': (0, 1), 'pattern_shape': (2, 4), 'max_row_orig_content': 2, 'replication_start_row': 3}

```
The metrics confirm the hypothesis:

*   **Pattern Source:** The row range for the pattern consistently matches the min/max row of the gray bar in column 0. The pattern itself consists of the pixels in columns 1 onwards within that row range.
*   **Pattern Shape:** The calculated pattern shapes (`pattern_shape`) match the repeating units observed in the expected outputs (e.g., Example 1: height 4, Example 3: height 2, Example 4: height 1).
*   **Replication Start:** The row where replication begins (`replication_start_row`) consistently corresponds to the row immediately following the maximum row containing any non-white, non-gray pixel in the input grid.

**3. Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - object: gray_bar
    description: A vertical bar composed of gray (5) pixels located exclusively in column 0.
    properties:
      - vertical_span: The range of rows occupied by the gray bar (min_row to max_row). Determined by finding the minimum and maximum row indices of gray pixels in column 0.
  - object: pattern_block
    description: A rectangular region of the input grid used for replication.
    properties:
      - source_rows: Identical to the vertical_span of the gray_bar.
      - source_columns: All columns starting from column 1 to the last column of the grid.
      - content: The pixel values from the input grid within the defined source_rows and source_columns.
      - height: (max_row of gray_bar) - (min_row of gray_bar) + 1.
  - object: original_content
    description: All non-white (0) and non-gray (5) pixels present in the input grid.
    properties:
      - max_row: The highest row index occupied by any pixel belonging to this set.
  - object: target_area
    description: The portion of the grid below the original_content where the pattern_block is replicated.
    properties:
      - start_row: (max_row of original_content) + 1.
      - columns: Same as the source_columns of the pattern_block (column 1 onwards).
      - end_row: The last row of the grid.

actions:
  - action: identify_gray_bar_span
    description: Find the minimum and maximum row indices containing gray (5) pixels in column 0.
  - action: extract_pattern_block
    description: Select the rectangular region of the input grid defined by the gray_bar's vertical_span and columns 1 through the width of the grid.
  - action: determine_replication_start
    description: Find the maximum row index containing any non-white (0) and non-gray (5) pixel in the input grid. The replication starts on the next row.
  - action: replicate_pattern
    description: >
      Copy the pattern_block repeatedly into the target_area. The first copy starts at the
      target_area's start_row. Each subsequent copy starts immediately below the
      previous one (start_row + N * pattern_height). Copying stops if the pattern
      would start beyond the grid's height. If a copy partially extends beyond the
      grid boundary, only the portion that fits is copied. The replication occurs
      only in the columns corresponding to the pattern_block (column 1 onwards).
      Column 0 remains unchanged from the input.
```


**4. Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all gray (5) pixels located in the first column (column 0). If none exist, return the unchanged output grid.
3.  Determine the minimum (`min_row_bar`) and maximum (`max_row_bar`) row indices among these gray pixels.
4.  Define the "pattern block" as the rectangular slice of the *input* grid covering rows from `min_row_bar` to `max_row_bar` (inclusive) and all columns *except* the first one (i.e., from column 1 to the end). Record the height of this pattern block (`pattern_height = max_row_bar - min_row_bar + 1`).
5.  If the grid width is 1 (only the gray bar column exists), the pattern block is empty; return the unchanged output grid.
6.  Find the maximum row index (`max_row_orig_content`) occupied by any non-white (0) and non-gray (5) pixel in the *entire* input grid. If no such pixels exist, treat `max_row_orig_content` as -1.
7.  Set the starting destination row for copying the pattern, `current_dest_row`, to `max_row_orig_content + 1`.
8.  Repeatedly perform the following copy operation as long as `current_dest_row` is less than the grid height:
    a.  Calculate the number of rows from the pattern block that can fit starting at `current_dest_row`, limited by the grid height (`rows_to_copy = min(pattern_height, grid_height - current_dest_row)`).
    b.  If `rows_to_copy` is 0 or less, stop the replication process.
    c.  Select the top `rows_to_copy` rows from the `pattern_block`.
    d.  Determine the destination slice in the `output_grid`: rows from `current_dest_row` to `current_dest_row + rows_to_copy - 1`, and columns from 1 to the end.
    e.  Copy the selected slice of the `pattern_block` to the destination slice in the `output_grid`.
    f.  Increment `current_dest_row` by `pattern_height` for the next iteration.
9.  Return the modified output grid.
