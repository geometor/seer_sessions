These lines act as axes of symmetry and also determine the color of the output shapes. A distinct shape, located in one quadrant (the top-left in all examples), is mirrored across these axes into the other three quadrants. The original central lines are then removed, resulting in a smaller output grid containing four identical shapes, all colored according to the original lines. The background color (white) is preserved.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Set the color of these four calculated positions in the output grid to `line_color`.\n    5.  Return the completed output grid."
