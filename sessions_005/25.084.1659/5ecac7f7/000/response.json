            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The input grids are rectangular with varying widths (all examples shown have width 17) and a consistent height of 5. The output grids always have a height of 5 and a width of 5.\n2.  **Color Palette**: Various colors (0-9) are used. Color 6 (magenta) appears consistently in the input grids as full vertical lines.\n3.  **Magenta Lines as Delimiters**: The vertical magenta lines (color 6) seem to divide the input grid into distinct vertical segments or sections. In all examples, these lines are located at column indices 5 and 11 (0-based indexing).\n4.  **Transformation**: The transformation appears to involve selecting specific columns from the input grid to form the output grid. The height of the grid remains unchanged.\n5.  **Column Selection Logic**: By comparing input and output columns across all examples, a consistent pattern emerges for selecting the input columns that form the 5 output columns:\n    *   Output Column 0 <- Input Column 0 (The very first column)\n    *   Output Column 1 <- Input Column 1 (The second column)\n    *   Output Column 2 <- Input Column 8 (This corresponds to the middle column of the segment between the two magenta lines, i.e., segment from index 6 to 10)"
