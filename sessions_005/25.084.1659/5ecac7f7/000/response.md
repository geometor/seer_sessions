Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure**: The input grids are rectangular with varying widths (all examples shown have width 17) and a consistent height of 5. The output grids always have a height of 5 and a width of 5.
2.  **Color Palette**: Various colors (0-9) are used. Color 6 (magenta) appears consistently in the input grids as full vertical lines.
3.  **Magenta Lines as Delimiters**: The vertical magenta lines (color 6) seem to divide the input grid into distinct vertical segments or sections. In all examples, these lines are located at column indices 5 and 11 (0-based indexing).
4.  **Transformation**: The transformation appears to involve selecting specific columns from the input grid to form the output grid. The height of the grid remains unchanged.
5.  **Column Selection Logic**: By comparing input and output columns across all examples, a consistent pattern emerges for selecting the input columns that form the 5 output columns:
    *   Output Column 0 <- Input Column 0 (The very first column)
    *   Output Column 1 <- Input Column 1 (The second column)
    *   Output Column 2 <- Input Column 8 (This corresponds to the middle column of the segment between the two magenta lines, i.e., segment from index 6 to 10)
