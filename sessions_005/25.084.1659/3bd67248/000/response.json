            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grids:** The input grids consist of a single column of a specific color (gray, magenta, azure) on the far left (column 0). The rest of the grid is filled with white (0).\n2.  **Output Grids:** The output grids retain the original colored column on the left. Two new patterns are introduced:\n    *   A diagonal line of red (2) pixels starting from the top-right corner and moving downwards and to the left, stopping one row above the bottom and one column away from the left edge.\n    *   A horizontal line of yellow (4) pixels filling the bottom-most row, starting from the second column (column 1) and extending to the right edge.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves overlaying specific geometric patterns (a diagonal line and a horizontal line) onto the input grid, replacing the white background pixels. The original colored column acts as a boundary or static element.\n4.  **Colors:** The specific color of the first column in the input doesn't affect the colors (red and yellow) or the shape/position of the patterns added in the output. It's simply preserved. White pixels are the canvas for the new patterns.\n5.  **Dimensions:** The dimensions (height and width) of the output grid are identical to the input grid. The placement of the patterns depends on these dimensions.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
