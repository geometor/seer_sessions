task_description: "Draw geometric patterns (diagonal and horizontal lines) based on grid dimensions, preserving the first column."
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height (H) and width (W).
  - background_color: White (0)
objects:
  - object: input_left_column
    description: "The first column (index 0) of the input grid."
    properties:
      - color: Varies per example (gray=5, magenta=6, azure=8).
      - shape: Vertical line spanning the full height.
      - location: Column 0.
  - object: output_left_column
    description: "The first column (index 0) of the output grid."
    properties:
      - color: Same as the input_left_column color for that example.
      - shape: Vertical line spanning the full height.
      - location: Column 0.
  - object: diagonal_line
    description: "A line of red pixels added in the output."
    properties:
      - color: Red (2)
      - shape: Diagonal line segment.
      - location: Starts at (row=0, col=W-1). Ends at (row=H-2, col=1). Follows coordinates (r, W-1-r) for r from 0 to H-2.
  - object: horizontal_line
    description: "A line of yellow pixels added in the output."
    properties:
      - color: Yellow (4)
      - shape: Horizontal line segment.
      - location: Spans the last row (row=H-1) from column 1 to column W-1. Coordinates (H-1, c) for c from 1 to W-1.

    details: "The position and length of the horizontal line depend on the grid height and width."
