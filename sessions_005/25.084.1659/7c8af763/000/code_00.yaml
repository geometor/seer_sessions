task_context:
  grid_size: fixed 10x10
  colors:
    - white (0): background/fillable area
    - blue (1): marker pixel, lower priority
    - red (2): marker pixel, higher priority
    - gray (5): boundary/wall pixel
  structures:
    - boundaries: contiguous lines/shapes of gray (5) pixels
    - regions: areas enclosed by gray (5) boundaries, containing non-gray pixels
    - markers: isolated blue (1) or red (2) pixels within regions
properties:
  - gray (5) pixels are static and unchanged between input and output.
  - regions are defined by the gray (5) boundaries.
  - each region in the input contains at least one marker pixel (1 or 2).
relationships:
  - marker pixels (1, 2) determine the fill color for the region they reside in.
  - red (2) has higher priority than blue (1) for determining the fill color.
actions:
  - identify: locate gray (5) boundary pixels.
  - identify: locate contiguous regions of non-gray pixels.
  - determine_fill_color: for each region, check for the presence of red (2) and blue (1) marker pixels from the input.
    - if red (2) is present, fill_color is red (2).
    - else if blue (1) is present, fill_color is blue (1).
  - apply_fill: change all non-gray (5) pixels within a region in the output grid to the determined fill_color.
