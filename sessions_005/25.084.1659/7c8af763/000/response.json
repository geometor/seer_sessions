They remain unchanged between input and output.\n4.  **Regions:** The gray lines divide the grid into distinct, enclosed regions.\n5.  **Marker Pixels (1 and 2):** Within each region defined by gray lines, there are one or more blue (1) or red (2) pixels in the input grid. These seem to act as markers or seeds.\n6.  **Background/Fill Color (0):** The white (0) pixels in the input grid are the primary targets for change.\n7.  **Transformation:** The white (0) pixels within a region are filled with a color determined by the marker pixels (1 or 2) present in that same region in the input. The original marker pixels themselves also adopt this fill color in the output, unless they are red (2) and red is the fill color, or blue (1) and blue is the fill color.\n\n**Analysis of Transformation Logic:**\n\n*   The gray (5) pixels act as immutable boundaries.\n*   The core transformation is a \"flood fill\" operation within the regions defined by the gray boundaries.\n*   The color used for the fill is determined by the *highest priority* marker pixel found within that region in the input grid.\n*   Observing the examples, red (2) seems to have higher priority than blue (1).\n    *   If a region contains at least one red (2) pixel, all non-gray pixels within that region become red (2) in the output.\n    *   If a region contains only blue (1) pixels (and no red (2)), all non-gray pixels within that region become blue (1) in the output.\n*   All pixels originally white (0), blue (1), or red (2) within a region are replaced by the determined fill color in the output, provided they are not part of the gray (5) boundary structure.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
