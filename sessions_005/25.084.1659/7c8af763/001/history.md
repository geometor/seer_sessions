Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are 10x10.
2.  **Key Colors:** The significant colors appear to be white (0), blue (1), red (2), and gray (5).
3.  **Gray Lines (5):** These form horizontal and vertical barriers or walls within the grid. They remain unchanged between input and output.
4.  **Regions:** The gray lines divide the grid into distinct, enclosed regions.
5.  **Marker Pixels (1 and 2):** Within each region defined by gray lines, there are one or more blue (1) or red (2) pixels in the input grid. These seem to act as markers or seeds.
6.  **Background/Fill Color (0):** The white (0) pixels in the input grid are the primary targets for change.
7.  **Transformation:** The white (0) pixels within a region are filled with a color determined by the marker pixels (1 or 2) present in that same region in the input. The original marker pixels themselves also adopt this fill color in the output, unless they are red (2) and red is the fill color, or blue (1) and blue is the fill color.

**Analysis of Transformation Logic:**

*   The gray (5) pixels act as immutable boundaries.
*   The core transformation is a "flood fill" operation within the regions defined by the gray boundaries.
*   The color used for the fill is determined by the *highest priority* marker pixel found within that region in the input grid.
*   Observing the examples, red (2) seems to have higher priority than blue (1).
    *   If a region contains at least one red (2) pixel, all non-gray pixels within that region become red (2) in the output.
    *   If a region contains only blue (1) pixels (and no red (2)), all non-gray pixels within that region become blue (1) in the output.
*   All pixels originally white (0), blue (1), or red (2) within a region are replaced by the determined fill color in the output, provided they are not part of the gray (5) boundary structure.

**YAML Fact Sheet:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_size: fixed 10x10
  colors:
    - white (0): background/fillable area
    - blue (1): marker pixel, lower priority
    - red (2): marker pixel, higher priority
    - gray (5): boundary/wall pixel
  structures:
    - boundaries: contiguous lines/shapes of gray (5) pixels
    - regions: areas enclosed by gray (5) boundaries, containing non-gray pixels
    - markers: isolated blue (1) or red (2) pixels within regions
properties:
  - gray (5) pixels are static and unchanged between input and output.
  - regions are defined by the gray (5) boundaries.
  - each region in the input contains at least one marker pixel (1 or 2).
relationships:
  - marker pixels (1, 2) determine the fill color for the region they reside in.
  - red (2) has higher priority than blue (1) for determining the fill color.
actions:
  - identify: locate gray (5) boundary pixels.
  - identify: locate contiguous regions of non-gray pixels.
  - determine_fill_color: for each region, check for the presence of red (2) and blue (1) marker pixels from the input.
    - if red (2) is present, fill_color is red (2).
    - else if blue (1) is present, fill_color is blue (1).
  - apply_fill: change all non-gray (5) pixels within a region in the output grid to the determined fill_color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all contiguous regions formed by pixels that are *not* gray (5). Use a connected components or flood fill approach, ensuring connectivity does not cross gray (5) pixels.
3.  For each identified region:
    a.  Examine all pixels within this region in the *input* grid.
    b.  Determine the `fill_color` for this region:
        i.  Set `fill_color` to blue (1) initially.
        ii. Check if any pixel within the region in the input grid is red (2). If yes, update `fill_color` to red (2).
    c.  Iterate through all pixel coordinates belonging to this region.
    d.  For each coordinate within the region, update the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid to the determined `fill_color`. (Ensure gray pixels are *not* modified, although the region identification step should already exclude them).
4.  Return the modified output grid.
