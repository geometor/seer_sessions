objects:
  - type: grid
    description: The input and output are 2D grids of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  - type: boundary
    color: gray (5)
    properties:
      - static
      - defines regions
      - pixels remain unchanged in the output
  - type: region
    definition: A contiguous area of non-gray pixels (colors 0, 1, 2).
    properties:
      - bounded by gray pixels or grid edges.
      - may contain marker pixels in the input.
  - type: marker_pixel
    colors: [red (2), blue (1)]
    location: Within a region in the input grid.
    role: Determine the fill color for the region.

actions:
  - name: identify_regions
    input: input grid
    output: sets of coordinates for each contiguous non-gray region
    method: Find connected components of pixels not equal to gray (5).
  - name: determine_fill_color
    input: region coordinates, input grid
    output: fill color (red or blue)
    logic: |
      Priority order: red (2) > blue (1) > default blue (1).
      1. Check all pixels within the region in the input grid.
      2. If any pixel is red (2), the fill color is red (2).
      3. Else if any pixel is blue (1), the fill color is blue (1).
      4. Else (region contains only white (0)), the fill color is blue (1).
  - name: fill_region
    input: output grid, region coordinates, fill color
    output: modified output grid
    method: Set the color of all pixels corresponding to the region coordinates in the output grid to the determined fill color.

transformation_rule:
  description: Apply a conditional flood fill to regions bounded by gray pixels.
  steps:
    - Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    - Identify all contiguous regions of non-gray pixels in the input grid.
    - For each identified region:
      - Determine the appropriate fill color based on the presence and priority of red (2) and blue (1) marker pixels within that region in the *input* grid (Red > Blue > Default Blue).
      - Fill all pixels belonging to that region in the *output* grid with the determined fill color.
    - Gray boundary pixels remain unchanged throughout the process.
