objects:
  - object: Grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing the input or output state.
  - object: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: An integer from 0-9 representing a color (0=white, 1=blue, 2=red, 5=gray).
      - coordinates: (row, column) position within the grid.
  - object: Region
    description: A contiguous area of non-gray pixels bounded by gray pixels or grid edges.
    properties:
      - pixels: A list of coordinates belonging to the region.
      - content_colors: The set of unique colors present in the region in the input grid.
      - markers: Pixels within the region that were originally blue (1) or red (2).
      - fillable_pixels: Pixels within the region that were originally white (0).
      - determining_marker_priority: Red (2) has higher priority than Blue (1).

actions:
  - action: IdentifyRegions
    description: Find all distinct contiguous regions of non-gray (0, 1, 2) pixels using connectivity (adjacency). Gray (5) pixels act as boundaries.
    inputs: Input Grid
    outputs: List of Regions (each with its pixel coordinates and content colors)
  - action: DetermineFillColor
    description: For a given region, determine the color to be used for filling based on the highest priority marker present within it.
    inputs: Region (specifically its content_colors)
    rules:
      - If Red (2) is present, fill color is Red (2).
      - Else if Blue (1) is present, fill color is Blue (1).
      - Else (only White (0) is present), fill color is Blue (1).
    outputs: Fill Color (1 or 2)
  - action: ApplyFill
    description: Modify the grid by changing the color of specific pixels based on the determined fill color for their region.
    inputs:
      - Output Grid (initially a copy of Input Grid)
      - Region (specifically its fillable_pixels coordinates)
      - Fill Color
    process: For each coordinate corresponding to a fillable_pixel (originally white) within the region, update its color in the Output Grid to the Fill Color.
    outputs: Modified Output Grid
  - action: PreservePixels
    description: Ensure certain pixels retain their original color.
    inputs: Input Grid, Output Grid
    process: Gray (5) pixels and original marker pixels (Blue=1, Red=2) within regions maintain their input color in the output grid. This is achieved by initializing the output grid as a copy and only modifying the originally white (0) pixels.
    outputs: Final Output Grid
