task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  background_color: 0 (white)
  key_marker_color: 5 (gray)

input_elements:
  - object: grid
    description: The input 2D array.
  - object: gray_marker
    properties:
      - color: 5
      - count: 1
      - role: Specifies the target location for the copied shape.
    location: (row_g, col_g)
  - object: source_shape
    properties:
      - contiguity: Pixels are connected (adjacency includes diagonals).
      - colors: Any color except 0 (white) and 5 (gray). Can be multi-colored.
      - count: 1
      - role: The shape to be copied.
    location: Defined by a set of coordinates {(row_s, col_s), ...}
    derived_properties:
      - bounding_box: (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)
      - center_reference: (center_row, center_col), calculated relative to the shape itself (e.g., center of the bounding box).

output_elements:
  - object: grid
    description: The output 2D array, same dimensions as the input.
  - object: original_source_shape
    properties:
      - Identical to the source_shape in the input.
    location: Same location as the source_shape in the input.
  - object: copied_shape
    properties:
      - Identical structure and coloring to the source_shape.
    location:
      - Positioned such that its center_reference aligns with the input gray_marker location (row_g, col_g).
      - Pixels overwrite existing grid content at the target location.

transformation:
  action: copy_paste_shape
  source: source_shape from input grid.
  destination_anchor: gray_marker location (row_g, col_g) from input grid.
  alignment: Center the source_shape (using its calculated center_reference) at the destination_anchor coordinates.
  effect: Pixels of the copied shape overwrite the output grid at the calculated target coordinates. The original source_shape remains. The gray_marker is implicitly removed/overwritten.
