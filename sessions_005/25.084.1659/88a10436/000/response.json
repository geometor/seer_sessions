            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9. The output grid generally retains most of the input grid's content, with a specific addition/modification.\n2.  **Key Objects:**\n    *   **Gray Marker (Color 5):** Each input grid contains exactly one gray pixel (color 5). This pixel acts as a marker or a target location indicator.\n    *   **Colored Shape:** Each input grid also contains a distinct, contiguous shape composed of colors other than white (0) and gray (5). This shape can be made of multiple colors.\n    *   **Background:** The rest of the grid is typically filled with the background color, white (0).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be copying the colored shape from its original location to a new location.\n4.  **Destination:** The destination for the copied shape is determined by the position of the gray marker pixel in the input grid. The colored shape is \"pasted\" such that its calculated center aligns with the coordinates of the input gray marker pixel.\n5.  **Overwriting:** The pasting process overwrites any existing pixels in the output grid at the target location, including the original gray marker pixel itself (which doesn't appear in the output).\n6.  **Persistence:** The original colored shape remains in its initial position in the output grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Locate the coordinates `(Gy, Gx)` of the single gray pixel (color 5) in the input grid.\n3.  Identify all connected pixels in the input grid that are not white (color 0) and not gray (color 5). This constitutes the \"source shape\".\n4.  Determine the bounding box of the source shape, finding its minimum and maximum row and column indices (`min_y`, `min_x`, `max_y`, `max_x`).\n5.  Calculate a reference point (the \"center\") for the source shape. A suitable reference point is the geometric center of its bounding box: `Ref_y = min_y + (max_y - min_y) // 2`, `Ref_x = min_x + (max_x - min_x) // 2`.\n6.  Iterate through all pixels `(Sy, Sx)` within the bounding box of the source shape in the input grid.\n7.  For each pixel `(Sy, Sx)`:\n    a.  Check if the pixel at `(Sy, Sx)` in the input grid actually belongs to the source shape (i.e., its color is not 0 or 5).\n    b.  If it belongs to the source shape, get its color `C`.\n    c.  Calculate the corresponding target coordinates `(Ty, Tx)` in the output grid based on the gray marker's location and the shape's reference point:\n        `Ty = Gy + (Sy - Ref_y)`\n        `Tx = Gx + (Sx - Ref_x)`\n    d.  If the target coordinates `(Ty, Tx)` are within the bounds of the grid, update the pixel at `(Ty, Tx)` in the output grid with the color `C`.\n8.  Return the modified output grid."
