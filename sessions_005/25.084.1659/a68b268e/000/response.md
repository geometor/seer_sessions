Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** All input grids are 9x9.
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** All output grids are 4x4.
3.  **Separator:** A consistent feature in all input grids is a horizontal line of blue pixels (color 1) in the middle row (row index 4). There's also a vertical column (column index 4) that, along with the blue line, effectively divides the input grid.
4.  **Quadrants:** The blue line and the central column divide the input grid into four distinct 4x4 regions or quadrants, excluding the dividing line and column themselves.
    *   Top-Left (TL): Rows 0-3, Columns 0-3
    *   Top-Right (TR): Rows 0-3, Columns 5-8
    *   Bottom-Left (BL): Rows 5-8, Columns 0-3
    *   Bottom-Right (BR): Rows 5-8, Columns 5-8
5.  **Transformation:** The 4x4 output grid seems to be a composite or overlay of the four 4x4 quadrants from the input grid.
6.  **Color Priority:** When combining the quadrants, there appears to be a priority system. By comparing corresponding cells across the four input quadrants with the output cell, a pattern emerges: the color from the Top-Left quadrant takes precedence. If the Top-Left cell is white (0), the Top-Right color is used. If both are white, the Bottom-Left color is used. If the first three are white, the Bottom-Right color is used. If all corresponding quadrant cells are white, the output cell is white.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the four 4x4 quadrants in the 9x9 input grid:
    *   Quadrant 1 (Q1): Top-Left region (rows 0-3, columns 0-3).
    *   Quadrant 2 (Q2): Top-Right region (rows 0-3, columns 5-8).
    *   Quadrant 3 (Q3): Bottom-Left region (rows 5-8, columns 0-3).
    *   Quadrant 4 (Q4): Bottom-Right region (rows 5-8, columns 5-8).
    *   Ignore the central row (index 4) and central column (index 4).
2.  Create a new 4x4 output grid, initially empty or filled with a default color (like white/0).
3.  For each position (row `r`, column `c`) in the 4x4 output grid (where `r` and `c` range from 0 to 3):
    *   Examine the color of the pixel at the corresponding position (`r`, `c`) in Quadrant 1 (Q1).
    *   If the pixel in Q1 is not white (color 0), copy this color to the output grid at position (`r`, `c`).
    *   If the pixel in Q1 is white, examine the color of the pixel at position (`r`, `c`) in Quadrant 2 (Q2).
    *   If the pixel in Q2 is not white, copy this color to the output grid at position (`r`, `c`).
    *   If the pixels in both Q1 and Q2 are white, examine the color of the pixel at position (`r`, `c`) in Quadrant 3 (Q3).
    *   If the pixel in Q3 is not white, copy this color to the output grid at position (`r`, `c`).
    *   If the pixels in Q1, Q2, and Q3 are all white, copy the color of the pixel at position (`r`, `c`) from Quadrant 4 (Q4) to the output grid at position (`r`, `c`).
4.  The resulting 4x4 grid is the final output.
