            "text": "*   **Perception:** The task involves completing potentially incomplete symmetrical patterns of colored pixels against a white background. The input grids contain arrangements of colored pixels (non-zero values). The output grids contain the same initial pixels plus additional colored pixels, such that the final pattern exhibits point symmetry (180-degree rotational symmetry) and potentially axial symmetry (reflection across horizontal and vertical axes) relative to a specific center point. This center point appears to be the geometric center of the bounding box encompassing all non-white pixels in the input grid. For every colored pixel in the input, corresponding pixels are added (or ensured to exist) at locations symmetrical to it with respect to the calculated center point (reflection across the center, reflection across the horizontal line through the center, and reflection across the vertical line through the center).\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

If there are no non-white pixels, the output is identical to the input.\n    3.  Determine the bounding box enclosing all non-white pixels by finding their minimum and maximum row and column indices (`min_r`, `min_c`, `max_r`, `max_c`).\n    4.  Calculate the center of symmetry: `center_r = (min_r + max_r) / 2`, `center_c = (min_c + max_c) / 2`. (These divisions should result in integer or half-integer coordinates defining the center axis/point).\n    5.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.\n    6.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` in the input grid that has a non-white color `clr`.\n    7.  For each such pixel `(r, c)`, calculate the coordinates of its three symmetrical counterparts relative to the center `(center_r, center_c)`:\n        a.  Horizontal reflection: `r_h = 2 * center_r - r`, `c_h = c`\n        b.  Vertical reflection: `r_v = r`, `c_v = 2 * center_c - c`\n        c.  Point reflection (center): `r_p = 2 * center_r - r`, `c_p = 2 * center_c - c`\n    8.  Ensure that the calculated coordinates `(r_h, c_h)`, `(r_v, c_v)`, and `(r_p, c_p)` are valid integer indices within the grid boundaries.\n    9.  For each valid symmetrical coordinate, set the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to `clr`. (This process effectively ensures that the original pixel `(r, c)` and its three symmetrical counterparts all have the color `clr` in the output grid).\n    10. Return the modified grid as the output."
