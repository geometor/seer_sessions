1. Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2. Identify all distinct connected components (objects) formed by blue (1) pixels in the input grid. These are the "enclosures".
3. For each identified blue enclosure:
    a. Determine its bounding box (minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, maximum column).
    b. Find the single pixel located within this bounding box in the input grid whose color is neither white (0) nor blue (1). This is the "seed" pixel for this enclosure. Record its color (`seed_color`) and its row coordinate (`seed_row`).
    c. Calculate the rectangular "fill area" for this enclosure:
        i. `fill_row_start` is the enclosure's minimum row minus 1 (but not less than 0).
        ii. `fill_row_end` is the seed pixel's row plus 1 (but not exceeding the grid's maximum row index).
        iii. `fill_col_start` is the enclosure's minimum column (but not less than 0).
        iv. `fill_col_end` is the enclosure's maximum column (but not exceeding the grid's maximum column index).
    d. Iterate through each pixel coordinate (`r`, `c`) within this calculated fill area (from `fill_row_start` to `fill_row_end`, and `fill_col_start` to `fill_col_end`).
    e. If the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the *original input grid* is white (0), change the color of the corresponding pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the *output grid* to the `seed_color`.
4. After processing all enclosures, return the final output grid.
