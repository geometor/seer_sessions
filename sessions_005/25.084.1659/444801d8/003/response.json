Identify all distinct connected components (objects) formed by blue (1) pixels in the input grid. These are the \"enclosures\".\n3. For each identified blue enclosure:\n    a. Determine its bounding box (minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, maximum column).\n    b. Find the single pixel located within this bounding box in the input grid whose color is neither white (0) nor blue (1). This is the \"seed\" pixel for this enclosure. Record its color (`seed_color`) and its row coordinate (`seed_row`).\n    c. Calculate the rectangular \"fill area\" for this enclosure:\n        i. `fill_row_start` is the enclosure's minimum row minus 1 (but not less than 0).\n        ii. `fill_row_end` is the seed pixel's row plus 1 (but not exceeding the grid's maximum row index).\n        iii. `fill_col_start` is the enclosure's minimum column (but not less than 0).\n        iv. `fill_col_end` is the enclosure's maximum column (but not exceeding the grid's maximum column index).\n    d. Iterate through each pixel coordinate (`r`, `c`) within this calculated fill area (from `fill_row_start` to `fill_row_end`, and `fill_col_start` to `fill_col_end`).\n    e. If the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the *original input grid* is white (0), change the color of the corresponding pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the *output grid* to the `seed_color`.\n4. After processing all enclosures, return the final output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_connected_components(grid, target_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all connected components of a specific color in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.ndarray): The input grid.\n        target_color (int): The color of the components to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of sets: A list where each set contains the (row, col) coordinates\n                      of the pixels belonging to a connected component.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros((height, width), dtype=bool)\n    components = []\n\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            if grid[r, c] == target_color and not visited[r, c]:\n                # Start BFS for a new component\n                component = set()\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                component.add((r, c))\n\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n\n                    # Check 8 neighbors (including diagonals)\n                    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                                continue\n                            nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n\n                            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and \\\n                               grid[nr, nc] == target_color and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                                visited[nr, nc] = True\n                                q.append((nr, nc))\n                                component.add((nr, nc))\n                \n                if component: # ensure we found something\n                    # Check if this component actually forms a closed loop \n                    # (this simplified check might be sufficient for this task,\n                    # assuming enclosures are well-formed)\n                    # A more robust check would analyze topology.\n                    # Based on examples, simply finding connected blue pixels seems enough.\n                    components.append(component)\n                    \n    return components\n\ndef get_bounding_box(component_coords):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the bounding box for a set of coordinates.\"\"\"\n    if not component_coords:\n        return None\n    min_r = min(r for r, c in component_coords)\n    max_r = max(r for r, c in component_coords)\n    min_c = min(c for r, c in component_coords)\n    max_c = max(c for r, c in component_coords)\n    return min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c\n\ndef find_seed_pixel(grid, bbox):\n    \"\"\"Finds the unique non-white, non-blue pixel within a bounding box.\"\"\"\n    min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c = bbox\n    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):\n        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):\n            color = grid[r, c]\n            if color != 0 and color != 1:\n                return r, c, color\n    return None # Should not happen based on task description\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule based on blue enclosures and seed pixels.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_np)\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n\n    # 1.
