The input grids contain one or more 'U'-shaped boundaries made of blue pixels (1). Inside each boundary, there's a single pixel of another color (e.g., red, green, magenta, azure). This single pixel acts as a \"seed\". The transformation consists of filling the 3x3 region immediately \"below and centered\" relative to the seed pixel with the seed's color. The original blue boundaries remain unchanged.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
