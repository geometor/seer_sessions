            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided Python code attempted to implement a transformation based on identifying \"seed\" pixels (non-white, non-blue) and filling a 3x3 area below them. However, the comparison with expected outputs reveals that this logic is incorrect. The transformed outputs consistently miss large filled areas present in the expected outputs, specifically areas above the seed pixel and often extending beyond a simple 3x3 region.\n\nThe errors indicate that the transformation rule is more complex and likely involves the blue (1) pixels, which form enclosures around the seed pixels. The fill color seems determined by the seed pixel, but the area to be filled is related to the enclosure structure, not just the seed pixel's coordinates. The previous code failed because it localized the effect too narrowly around the seed pixel and only considered the area below it.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors is to:\n1.  Re-analyze the relationship between the blue enclosures, the seed pixels within them, and the filled areas in the expected outputs.\n2.  Identify the precise rule defining the boundaries of the filled area.\n3.  Identify the rule determining which pixels within that area are colored (e.g., only originally white pixels).\n4.  Formulate a new natural language program based on these corrected observations.\n\n## Metrics and Observations\n\nBased on the visual comparison between Input, Expected Output, and the (incorrect) Transformed Output for each example:\n\n*   **Common Structure:** All examples feature one or more closed loops or enclosures made of blue (1) pixels. Inside each enclosure, there is exactly one pixel of a color other than blue (1) or white (0). Let's call this the \"seed\" pixel. The background is white (0).\n*   **Transformation Goal:** The transformation fills certain areas of the grid with the color of the seed pixel associated with that area. The blue enclosures and the seed pixels themselves are preserved in the output.\n*   **Fill Area:** The filled area in the expected output is rectangular and appears related to both the blue enclosure's position and the seed pixel's row. Specifically:\n    *   The columns of the filled rectangle correspond to the horizontal span (minimum to maximum column) of the associated blue enclosure.\n    *   The rows of the filled rectangle start one row *above* the top-most row of the blue enclosure and extend down to one row *below* the row containing the seed pixel.\n*   **Fill Condition:** Within the calculated rectangular fill area, only pixels that were originally white (0) in the input grid are changed to the seed color in the output grid. Pixels that were blue (1) or the seed color remain unchanged.\n*   **Code Failure Analysis:** The previous code failed because:\n    *   It did not identify the blue enclosures or use their boundaries.\n    *   It incorrectly assumed the fill area was a small 3x3 region fixed *below* the seed pixel.\n    *   The actual fill area is significantly larger, determined by the enclosure's bounds and the seed's row, and extends both above and below the seed.\n\n**(No code execution needed for these observations as they are derived from direct comparison and pattern recognition across the provided examples.)**\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
