*   **Perception:** The task involves identifying specific non-background, non-boundary pixels within enclosed shapes and using their color to fill the enclosed area. The input grids contain one or more 'U'-shaped boundaries made of blue pixels (1). Inside each boundary, there's a single pixel of another color (e.g., red, green, magenta, azure). This single pixel acts as a "seed". The transformation consists of filling the 3x3 region immediately "below and centered" relative to the seed pixel with the seed's color. The original blue boundaries remain unchanged.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Identify seed pixels within blue boundaries and fill a 3x3 area relative to each seed with its color.
    
    elements:
      - element: grid
        description: A 2D array of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9.
      - element: boundary
        description: A contiguous shape made of blue pixels (color 1), often resembling a 'U'. Acts as a container.
      - element: seed_pixel
        description: A single pixel inside a boundary, with a color other than white (0) or blue (1). Its color determines the fill color.
        properties:
          - color: The color of the seed pixel (e.g., red, green, magenta, azure).
          - location: The (row, column) coordinates of the seed pixel.
      - element: fill_area
        description: A 3x3 region defined relative to the seed pixel's location. Specifically, if the seed is at (r, c), the fill area covers rows r to r+2 and columns c-1 to c+1.
      - element: background
        description: Pixels with white color (0).
    
    relationships:
      - relationship: containment
        description: The seed pixel is located spatially 'inside' the blue boundary.
      - relationship: relative_position
        description: The fill_area's position is fixed relative to the seed_pixel's location.
    
    actions:
      - action: identify_seeds
        description: Scan the input grid to find all pixels that are not white (0) and not blue (1).
      - action: define_fill_area
        description: For each seed pixel at (r, c), define the target 3x3 area as rows r to r+2 and columns c-1 to c+1.
      - action: fill
        description: For each seed pixel, change the color of pixels within its corresponding 3x3 fill_area in the output grid to the seed's color, but only if the original pixel in the input grid was white (0) or the seed pixel itself.
      - action: preserve
        description: Keep the blue boundaries (1) and any background pixels (0) outside the fill areas unchanged in the output grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
    2.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.
    3.  If the pixel at `(r, c)` has a color `C` that is *not* white (0) and *not* blue (1), then this pixel is identified as a "seed pixel".
    4.  For this seed pixel at `(r, c)` with color `C`:
        a.  Define a target 3x3 area encompassing rows `r` to `r+2` and columns `c-1` to `c+1`.
        b.  Iterate through each coordinate `(nr, nc)` within this 3x3 target area.
        c.  Check if the coordinate `(nr, nc)` is within the bounds of the grid.
        d.  If it is within bounds, check the color of the pixel at `(nr, nc)` in the *original input grid*.
        e.  If the original color at `(nr, nc)` was white (0), OR if `(nr, nc)` is the location of the seed pixel itself `(r, c)`, then update the pixel at `(nr, nc)` in the *output grid* to color `C`.
    5.  After checking all pixels in the input grid and performing fills for all identified seed pixels, return the final output grid.
