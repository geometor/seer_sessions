For each seed pixel found at coordinates (r, c) with color C, define a 3x3 target area below and centered relative to the seed, covering rows r to r+2 and columns c-1 to c+1. Within this 3x3 area, change the color of pixels in the output grid to C, but only if the corresponding pixel in the original input grid was white (0) or if it is the seed pixel itself.
