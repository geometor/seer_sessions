This connection can be horizontal or vertical.\n3.  **Gray Pixel:** Acts as a fixed point or pivot. It does not change color or position.\n4.  **Output Grid:** The original red pixels change color to green (3) but remain in their initial positions. New red pixels (2) appear in the output grid. The position of these new red pixels seems related to the original red pixels and the gray pivot.\n5.  **Transformation:** The overall transformation appears to involve two distinct actions centered around the gray pixel:\n    *   **Color Change:** The original red (2) pixels become green (3).\n    *   **Replication/Rotation:** A new copy of the original red shape, still colored red (2), is placed on the grid. This new shape's position is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise relative to the gray pivot point, compared to the original red shape's position.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify the coordinates `(r_red, c_red)` of all red (2) pixels in the input grid.\n4.  For each identified red pixel at `(r_red, c_red)`:\n    a.  Change the pixel color at `(r_red, c_red)` in the output grid to green (3).\n    b.  Calculate the relative position of this red pixel with respect to the gray pivot: `dr = r_red - r_gray`, `dc = c_red - c_gray`.\n    c.  Calculate the new relative position after a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation: `dr_new = -dc`, `dc_new = dr`.\n    d.  Calculate the new absolute position on the grid: `r_new = r_gray + dr_new`, `c_new = c_gray + dc_new`.\n    e.  If the calculated position `(r_new, c_new)` is within the bounds of the grid, change the pixel color at `(r_new, c_new)` in the output grid to red (2). (Ensure this step does not overwrite the original gray pixel, although the rotation logic should naturally prevent this)."
