Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** All examples involve a 10x10 grid. The output grid is the same size as the input grid.
2.  **Input Content:** The input grids consist mainly of a white background (color 0). Non-white colored pixels appear exclusively in the first (leftmost) and last (rightmost) columns.
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation modifies entire rows based on the colors found at the ends of those rows in the input.
4.  **Core Logic:** If a row in the input grid has the *exact same* non-white color in its first and last cells, that entire row in the output grid is filled with that color.
5.  **No Change Condition:** If the first and last cells of a row in the input grid have different colors, or if one or both are white, the row remains unchanged in the output grid.
6.  **Example Breakdown:**
    *   **Train 1:** Rows 1 (azure) and 7 (blue) have matching non-white ends and are filled in the output. Other rows have mismatched ends and remain unchanged.
    *   **Train 2:** Only row 5 (yellow) has matching non-white ends and is filled.
    *   **Train 3:** No row has matching non-white ends, so the output is identical to the input.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_context: Grid transformation based on row properties.
grid_properties:
  - size: All examples use 10x10 grids. Input and output dimensions are identical.
  - background_color: white (0) is the predominant background color.
objects:
  - type: Individual pixels act as markers.
  - location: Non-white pixels are primarily located at the horizontal edges (first and last columns) of the grid within specific rows.
relationships:
  - type: Comparison within rows.
  - description: The color of the pixel in the first column of a row is compared to the color of the pixel in the last column of the same row.
actions:
  - name: Fill Row
  - condition: If the first pixel and the last pixel of a row in the input grid are the same non-white color.
  - effect: The entire corresponding row in the output grid is filled with that color.
  - name: Copy Row
  - condition: If the first and last pixels of a row are different colors, or if at least one of them is white.
  - effect: The corresponding row in the output grid is identical to the input row.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially identical to the input.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from top to bottom.
3.  For the current row, identify the color of the pixel in the first column (leftmost) and the color of the pixel in the last column (rightmost).
4.  Check if both the leftmost pixel and the rightmost pixel are the *same* color, AND this color is *not* white (0).
5.  If the condition in step 4 is true, change the color of *all* pixels in the corresponding row of the *output* grid to this matching color.
6.  If the condition in step 4 is false (colors are different, or one/both are white), leave the corresponding row in the output grid unchanged (it remains as copied from the input in step 1).
7.  After checking all rows, the final output grid is complete.
