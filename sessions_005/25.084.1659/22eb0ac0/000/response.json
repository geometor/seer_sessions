The output grid is the same size as the input grid.\n2.  **Input Content:** The input grids consist mainly of a white background (color 0). Non-white colored pixels appear exclusively in the first (leftmost) and last (rightmost) columns.\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation modifies entire rows based on the colors found at the ends of those rows in the input.\n4.  **Core Logic:** If a row in the input grid has the *exact same* non-white color in its first and last cells, that entire row in the output grid is filled with that color.\n5.  **No Change Condition:** If the first and last cells of a row in the input grid have different colors, or if one or both are white, the row remains unchanged in the output grid.\n6.  **Example Breakdown:**\n    *   **Train 1:** Rows 1 (azure) and 7 (blue) have matching non-white ends and are filled in the output. Other rows have mismatched ends and remain unchanged.\n    *   **Train 2:** Only row 5 (yellow) has matching non-white ends and is filled.\n    *   **Train 3:** No row has matching non-white ends, so the output is identical to the input.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Check if both the leftmost pixel and the rightmost pixel are the *same* color, AND this color is *not* white (0).\n5.
