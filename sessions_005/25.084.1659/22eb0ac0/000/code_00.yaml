task_context: Grid transformation based on row properties.
grid_properties:
  - size: All examples use 10x10 grids. Input and output dimensions are identical.
  - background_color: white (0) is the predominant background color.
objects:
  - type: Individual pixels act as markers.
  - location: Non-white pixels are primarily located at the horizontal edges (first and last columns) of the grid within specific rows.
relationships:
  - type: Comparison within rows.
  - description: The color of the pixel in the first column of a row is compared to the color of the pixel in the last column of the same row.
actions:
  - name: Fill Row
  - condition: If the first pixel and the last pixel of a row in the input grid are the same non-white color.
  - effect: The entire corresponding row in the output grid is filled with that color.
  - name: Copy Row
  - condition: If the first and last pixels of a row are different colors, or if at least one of them is white.
  - effect: The corresponding row in the output grid is identical to the input row.
