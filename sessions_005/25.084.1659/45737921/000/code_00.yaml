task_description: Swap the two constituent colors within each distinct multi-colored object.
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - property: Composed of non-white pixels.
  - property: Contiguous blocks of pixels.
  - property: Each object in the examples consists of exactly two distinct non-white colors.
  - relationship: Objects are separated by the background color.
transformation:
  - action: Identify distinct objects.
  - condition: If an object is composed of exactly two different non-white colors (color A and color B).
  - action: Within that object, change all pixels of color A to color B, and all pixels of color B to color A.
  - condition: If a pixel is part of the background (white).
  - action: Leave the pixel unchanged.
  - condition: If an object is composed of only one non-white color (hypothetical, not seen in examples).
  - action: Leave the object unchanged (implied).
invariance:
  - The shape and position of each object remain the same.
  - The background pixels remain the same.
