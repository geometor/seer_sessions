description: Swaps the two constituent colors within distinct objects composed of exactly two non-background colors.
background_color: 0 # white
grid_properties:
  preserves_size: true
  preserves_colors: true # The overall palette remains the same, though colors are swapped within objects.
object_properties:
  definition: Connected components of non-background pixels (adjacency includes diagonals).
  relevant_objects: All distinct non-background objects.
transformation:
  per_object:
    - description: Analyze the distinct non-background colors within the object.
      conditions:
        - if: The object contains exactly two distinct non-background colors (Color A, Color B).
          then:
            - action: Swap colors within the object.
              details: All pixels of Color A become Color B, and all pixels of Color B become Color A.
        - if: The object contains one, or more than two, distinct non-background colors.
          then:
            - action: No change.
              details: The object remains as it is in the input.
  background: Remains unchanged.
notes: The initial code failed due to a missing dependency (`scipy`), but the underlying logic appears correct based on analysis of all training examples. The object finding needs reimplementation without `scipy`.
