"""
Identifies distinct connected objects composed of non-white pixels. 
If an object is composed of exactly two distinct non-white colors (Color A and Color B), 
it swaps these colors within the object: all pixels of Color A become Color B, and all pixels of Color B become Color A. 
Objects with only one non-white color or more than two non-white colors remain unchanged. 
White background pixels remain unchanged.
