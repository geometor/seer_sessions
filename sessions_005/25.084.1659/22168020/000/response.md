*   **Perception:** The task involves processing grids containing scattered pixels of various colors (blue, yellow, green, magenta, azure) against a white background. The transformation seems to operate independently on each non-white color within each row. For a given color in a row, the output grid shows a continuous horizontal line of that color, spanning from the leftmost occurrence to the rightmost occurrence of that color in the input row. Pixels outside this span, or in rows without that specific color, remain unchanged unless affected by another color's transformation in the same row (though this doesn't occur in the examples, the logic implies overwriting).

*   **YAML:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Fill horizontally between the extreme points of each color within each row.
    
    elements:
      - element: grid
        description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors. Background is typically white (0).
      - element: non_white_pixel
        description: A pixel with a color value from 1 to 9. These pixels define the shapes/objects to be processed.
    
    objects:
      - object: color_group
        description: All pixels of the same non-white color in the input grid.
    
    properties:
      - property: color
        description: The specific color value (1-9) of a non_white_pixel.
      - property: position
        description: The (row, column) index of a pixel.
      - property: row_extent
        description: For a specific color and a specific row, the minimum and maximum column index where that color appears.
        properties:
          - min_col
          - max_col
          - row_index
          - color
    
    actions:
      - action: identify_colors
        description: Find all unique non-white colors present in the input grid.
      - action: process_row_for_color
        description: For a given color and a specific row in the input grid:
        steps:
          - Find all column indices where the color appears.
          - If the color appears in the row, determine the minimum (min_col) and maximum (max_col) column index.
          - In the corresponding row of the output grid, fill all pixels from min_col to max_col (inclusive) with the given color.
    
    relationships:
      - relationship: horizontal_span
        description: Pixels of the same color within the same row define a horizontal span from the leftmost to the rightmost pixel of that color in that row.
    
    constraints:
      - The transformation is applied independently for each non-white color.
      - The transformation operates row by row.
      - White (0) pixels act as the background and are only changed if they fall within the horizontal span being filled by a non-white color.
      - Grid dimensions remain unchanged.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
    2.  Identify all unique colors present in the input grid, excluding white (color 0).
    3.  For each unique non-white color found:
        a.  Iterate through each row index of the grid (from top to bottom).
        b.  Scan the current row in the input grid to find all column indices where the current non-white color exists.
        c.  If one or more pixels of the current color are found in this row:
            i.  Determine the minimum (leftmost) column index (`min_col`) and the maximum (rightmost) column index (`max_col`) among these pixels.
            ii. Iterate through the columns from `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive) in the current row of the *output* grid.
            iii. Set the color of each pixel within this range (`min_col` to `max_col`) in the current row of the *output* grid to the current non-white color.
    4.  After processing all unique non-white colors for all rows, return the final output grid.
