The transformation seems to operate independently on each non-white color within each row. For a given color in a row, the output grid shows a continuous horizontal line of that color, spanning from the leftmost occurrence to the rightmost occurrence of that color in the input row. Pixels outside this span, or in rows without that specific color, remain unchanged unless affected by another color's transformation in the same row (though this doesn't occur in the examples, the logic implies overwriting).\n\n*   **YAML:**\n    "
