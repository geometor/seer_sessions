Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both grids of pixels represented by numbers (colors).
2.  **Background Color:** The predominant color in all examples is orange (7), which acts as a static background. It remains unchanged between input and output.
3.  **Objects:** The non-background pixels form distinct vertical lines, each one pixel wide and consisting of a single color. These lines have varying heights and vertical positions but always span contiguous rows within their column.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the horizontal position (column index) of these vertical lines. The vertical position (row span) and color of each line remain the same.
5.  **Movement Pattern:** The lines appear to shift horizontally. Observing the column indices:
    *   In `train_1` (width 9), lines are at columns 1, 3, 5, 7. They move to columns 3, 5, 7, 1 respectively.
    *   In `train_2` (width 7), lines are at columns 1, 3, 5. They move to columns 3, 5, 1 respectively.
    *   In `train_3` (width 11), lines are at columns 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. They move to columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 1 respectively.
6.  **Rule Discovery:** The pattern suggests a cyclic shift based on the *positions* the lines occupy. If we list the columns containing lines in sorted order, the line originally in the column at index `i` of this sorted list moves to the column specified at index `(i + 1)` (wrapping around for the last line, which moves to the column of the first line).

    steps:
      - "Create output grid of same dimensions as input, filled with background color."
      - "For each identified vertical line:"
      - "  Get its initial column `c_in`."
      - "  Find its final column `c_out` using the map_columns result."
      - "  Draw the line with its original color and vertical extent at column `c_out` in the output grid."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (orange, 7).
2.  Identify all vertical line segments in the input grid that are not the background color. For each line, record its color, its column index, and the range of rows it occupies.
3.  Create a list of the unique column indices where these vertical lines were found.
4.  Sort this list of column indices in ascending order. Let this sorted list be `sorted_columns`.
5.  Determine the target column for each line: The line originally found in the column `sorted_columns[i]` will move to the column specified by `sorted_columns[(i + 1) % N]`, where `N` is the total number of unique columns found in step 3.
6.  For each vertical line identified in step 2:
    a.  Determine its original column index (`original_col`).
    b.  Find its target column index (`target_col`) using the cyclic mapping derived in step 5.
    c.  Draw the line onto the output grid at the `target_col`, using its original color and occupying the same rows it did in the input grid.
7.  Return the completed output grid.
