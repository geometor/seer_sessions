**Perception:**

The task involves identifying specific geometric patterns within the input grid and modifying the background color (white) based on these patterns. The input grid consistently features 2x2 gray squares separated by white pixels. These white pixels form distinct rows and columns that run entirely across the grid, separating the gray squares. The transformation rule focuses on these fully white rows and columns. The core operation is to "color in" these white rows and columns with red, and mark their intersections with blue. The original gray squares remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Contains 2x2 gray (5) squares.
    - Contains white (0) pixels acting as background and separators.
  Features:
    - Presence of rows consisting entirely of white pixels ("white rows").
    - Presence of columns consisting entirely of white pixels ("white columns").

OutputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Retains the original gray (5) squares in their positions.
    - White pixels from the input are replaced by white (0), red (2), or blue (1).

Transformation:
  Action: Color filling and marking based on geometry.
  Rule:
    - Identify all "white rows" and "white columns" in the input grid.
    - Copy the input grid to create the output grid.
    - For each pixel location (r, c):
      - If the input pixel `input[r][c]` is white (0):
        - Define `is_white_row = (row r consists entirely of white pixels in the input)`.
        - Define `is_white_col = (column c consists entirely of white pixels in the input)`.
        - If `is_white_row` AND `is_white_col`:
          - Set `output[r][c]` to blue (1).
        - Else if `is_white_row` OR `is_white_col`:
          - Set `output[r][c]` to red (2).
        - Else:
          - Keep `output[r][c]` as white (0). # Pixel was white but not in a full white row/col
      - Else (input pixel is not white):
        - Keep `output[r][c]` the same as `input[r][c]`. # Non-white pixels are preserved
  Relationships:
    - Red pixels appear in locations that were part of a "white row" or a "white column" in the input, but not both.
    - Blue pixels appear in locations that were the intersection of a "white row" and a "white column" in the input.
    - Gray pixels remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all row indices `r` such that every pixel in `input[r][:]` is white (0). Store these indices in a set called `WhiteRows`.
3.  Identify all column indices `c` such that every pixel in `input[:][c]` is white (0). Store these indices in a set called `WhiteCols`.
4.  Iterate through each pixel of the grid using its row index `r` and column index `c`.
5.  If the pixel at `input[r][c]` is white (0):
    a.  Check if `r` is present in the `WhiteRows` set.
    b.  Check if `c` is present in the `WhiteCols` set.
    c.  If both `r` is in `WhiteRows` AND `c` is in `WhiteCols`, change the corresponding pixel in the output grid, `output[r][c]`, to blue (1).
    d.  Else if `r` is in `WhiteRows` OR `c` is in `WhiteCols` (but not both, based on the previous condition), change the corresponding pixel in the output grid, `output[r][c]`, to red (2).
    e.  (Implicitly, if the pixel was white but neither condition (c) nor (d) was met, it remains white (0) because the output grid was initialized as a copy).
6.  (Implicitly, if the pixel at `input[r][c]` was not white (0), it remains unchanged in the output grid because the output grid was initialized as a copy).
7.  Return the final output grid.
