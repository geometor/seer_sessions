The input grid consistently features 2x2 gray squares separated by white pixels. These white pixels form distinct rows and columns that run entirely across the grid, separating the gray squares. The transformation rule focuses on these fully white rows and columns. The core operation is to \"color in\" these white rows and columns with red, and mark their intersections with blue. The original gray squares remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
