"""
Identifies rows and columns consisting entirely of white (0) pixels in the input grid. 
Colors the pixels in these rows/columns red (2) in the output grid. 
Colors the intersection points of these white rows and columns blue (1) in the output grid. 
All other pixels retain their original color from the input grid.
