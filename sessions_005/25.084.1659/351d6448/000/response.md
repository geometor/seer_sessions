Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** Both input grids have a similar structure. They are relatively tall and contain horizontal lines of gray pixels (color 5) that seem to act as separators. Between these separators (and before the first/after the last), there are other non-white objects. The input grids have a width of 13.
2.  **Separators:** The gray lines (color 5) divide the input grid into distinct horizontal sections or "frames". Each frame contains a specific pattern or object instance.
3.  **Objects & Sequence:**
    *   In `train_1`, the objects are horizontal lines of blue pixels (color 1). Their length increases progressively in each subsequent frame (2, 4, 6, 8).
    *   In `train_2`, the objects are a fixed shape `2 2 3` (red, red, green). Their horizontal position (starting column) shifts progressively to the right in each subsequent frame (starts at col 1, then 2, then 3, then 4).
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to identify the sequence defined by the objects in the separated frames and then extrapolate the *next* step in that sequence. The gray separators themselves are discarded.
5.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is consistently 3 rows high and has the same width as the input (13 columns). It contains only the *next* predicted object from the sequence, placed on the middle row (row index 1), against a white background (color 0).
6.  **Progression Type:** Both examples show an arithmetic progression. In `train_1`, the length increases by 2 each time. In `train_2`, the starting column index increases by 1 each time.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty list to store the sequence objects and their relevant properties.
2.  Scan the input grid row by row to identify horizontal lines composed entirely of gray pixels (color 5). These are separators.
3.  Define "frames" as the sections of the grid between consecutive separators (or grid boundaries and the first/last separator).
4.  For each frame:
    a.  Locate the primary non-white, non-gray object(s).
    b.  Determine the key property that changes between frames (e.g., the length of the blue line in train_1, the starting column of the `2 2 3` shape in train_2).
    c.  Record the object itself (its shape and colors) and the value of its changing property for this frame. Store this information. Assume the first object found per frame is the relevant one.
5.  Analyze the sequence of property values recorded in step 4c across the frames. Verify it forms an arithmetic progression and determine the common difference.
6.  Calculate the value of the changing property for the *next* step in the sequence by adding the common difference to the property value from the last frame.
7.  Determine the object for the next step. If the object's shape/color changed, extrapolate that too (though in these examples, only size or position changes). In these examples, the object's intrinsic shape/color remains the same as in the last frame, only its size or position changes according to the calculated next property value.
8.  Create a new grid with 3 rows and the same width as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
9.  Place the predicted object (determined in step 7) onto the middle row (row index 1) of the new grid, respecting its calculated properties (e.g., length, starting position).
