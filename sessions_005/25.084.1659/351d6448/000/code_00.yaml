    color_name: varies (blue in train_1; red/green in train_2)
    color_value: varies (1 in train_1; 2, 3 in train_2)
    shape: varies (horizontal line in train_1; fixed '2 2 3' shape in train_2)
    properties_tracked:
      - property: size (length) # train_1
        progression: arithmetic (increment of 2)
      - property: position (starting column index) # train_2
        progression: arithmetic (increment of 1)

transformation:
  - action: identify_frames
    using: gray separator lines
  - action: extract_objects
    from: each frame (ignoring separators and background)
  - action: identify_sequence
    based_on: changing property of the object across frames (e.g., size, position)
    type: arithmetic_progression
  - action: predict_next_object
    by: calculating the next term in the identified sequence for the relevant property
  - action: render_output
    grid_size: 3 x input_width
    content: place the predicted next object in the middle row (row 1), rest is background (white)
