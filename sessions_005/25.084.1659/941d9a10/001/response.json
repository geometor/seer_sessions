Identify all contiguous regions composed solely of white pixels (0). These regions are bounded by the grid edges and any gray pixels (5).\n2. Locate the white region that includes the top-left pixel at coordinate (0, 0). If this pixel is white, change the color of all pixels within this region to blue (1).\n3. Determine the geometric center coordinates of the grid (H // 2, W // 2). Identify the white region that contains this geometric center point. If this pixel is white, change the color of all pixels within this region to red (2).\n4. Locate the white region that includes the bottom-right pixel at coordinate (height-1, width-1). If this pixel is white, change the color of all pixels within this region to green (3).\n5. All gray pixels (5) and any white pixels (0) not part of the three specifically targeted regions remain unchanged.\n6. If multiple target points (top-left, center, bottom-right) fall within the same contiguous white region, the fill operations are applied sequentially (blue, then red, then green), meaning later fills might overwrite earlier ones within that shared region. However, the examples suggest these target regions are distinct.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_and_fill_region(output_grid, input_grid, start_row, start_col, fill_color, visited):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find a contiguous white region \n    starting from (start_row, start_col) in the input_grid.
