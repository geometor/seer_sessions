*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input grids consist of a white background (0) and gray lines (5), both horizontal and vertical.
    *   The gray lines act as dividers, partitioning the white background into distinct rectangular regions.
    *   The output grids retain the gray lines but change the color of specific white regions.
    *   Three colors are introduced in the output: blue (1), red (2), and green (3).
    *   The placement of the introduced colors seems related to the position of the white regions defined by the gray lines.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Identify specific white regions bounded by gray lines and grid edges, then fill them with designated colors.
    elements:
      - type: background
        color: 0 (white)
        role: Canvas, partitioned by dividers.
      - type: divider
        color: 5 (gray)
        role: Static lines (horizontal and vertical) that partition the background.
        properties:
          - position: Varies between examples.
          - orientation: Horizontal or Vertical.
      - type: region
        description: Contiguous area of white pixels.
        properties:
          - bounded_by: Grid edges and/or gray dividers.
          - location: Relative position within the grid (e.g., top-left, center, bottom-right).
    actions:
      - action: identify_regions
        target: White background (0)
        constraints: Regions are defined by gray dividers (5) and grid boundaries.
      - action: select_region
        criteria:
          - Contains the top-left corner pixel (0, 0).
          - Contains the geometric center of the grid.
          - Contains the bottom-right corner pixel (height-1, width-1).
      - action: fill_region
        source_color: 0 (white)
        target_color:
          - 1 (blue) for the top-left region.
          - 2 (red) for the center region.
          - 3 (green) for the bottom-right region.
    relationships:
      - The gray lines define the boundaries of the white regions.
      - The location of a white region determines if and how its color is changed.
      - The output grid preserves the gray lines from the input.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Start with the input grid.
    2.  Identify all contiguous regions composed solely of white pixels (0). These regions are bounded by the grid edges and any gray pixels (5).
    3.  Locate the white region that includes the top-left pixel at coordinate (0, 0). Change the color of all pixels within this region to blue (1).
    4.  Determine the geometric center coordinates of the grid (e.g., for a 10x10 grid, this is conceptually between rows 4 and 5, and columns 4 and 5). Identify the white region that contains this geometric center point. Change the color of all pixels within this region to red (2).
    5.  Locate the white region that includes the bottom-right pixel at coordinate (height-1, width-1). Change the color of all pixels within this region to green (3).
    6.  All gray pixels (5) and any white pixels (0) not part of the three selected regions remain unchanged.
    7.  The resulting grid is the output.
