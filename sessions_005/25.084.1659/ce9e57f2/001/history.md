**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of pixels with colors represented by integers (0=white, 2=red, 8=azure).
2.  **Color Palette:** The transformation only involves white (0), red (2), and azure (8) pixels. Only red pixels change color, becoming azure. White pixels remain white.
3.  **Primary Objects:** The key objects appear to be vertical contiguous segments (or blocks) of red pixels within each column.
4.  **Transformation Locus:** The changes from red to azure occur exclusively within these vertical red blocks.
5.  **Transformation Trigger:** The change seems localized to the bottom end of these red blocks. Specifically, the lowest red pixel in the *bottom-most* red block within a column, and the two red pixels immediately above it (if they exist *within the same block*), are changed to azure.
6.  **No Change Condition:** Red pixels that are part of a block but are more than two positions above the block's lowest pixel remain red. Red pixels in blocks that are *not* the bottom-most block in a column also remain red.
7.  **Spatial Context:** The transformation depends solely on the vertical arrangement of red pixels within each column. The horizontal position relative to other columns or non-red pixels seems irrelevant, except for defining the column boundaries.

**Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: Grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels.
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer from 0-9 (white=0, red=2, azure=8 are relevant).
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
  - type: Vertical Red Block
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more red (2) pixels in the same column.
    properties:
      - column_index: The column the block resides in.
      - row_range: The start and end row indices of the block [min_row, max_row].
      - bottom_most: Boolean indicating if this is the lowest block in its column (max_row is highest among blocks in the same column).

actions:
  - name: Identify Vertical Red Blocks
    input: Input Grid
    output: List of Vertical Red Block objects for each column.
  - name: Filter Bottom-most Blocks
    input: List of Vertical Red Blocks for a column
    output: The single Vertical Red Block with the highest max_row in that column.
  - name: Change Color
    description: Modify the color of specific pixels from red (2) to azure (8).
    target: Red pixels within the bottom-most block at positions (max_row, col), (max_row-1, col), (max_row-2, col), provided they exist and are part of the block.

relationships:
  - type: Containment
    description: The Grid contains Pixels. Columns contain Pixels. Vertical Red Blocks consist of Pixels.
  - type: Positional
    description: Pixels have relative positions (above, below) within the same column. Blocks can be above or below other blocks in the same column.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each column of the input grid.
3.  Within the current column, identify all distinct vertical contiguous blocks of red (2) pixels. Record their start and end row indices.
4.  If no red blocks are found in the column, proceed to the next column.
5.  If one or more red blocks are found, identify the *bottom-most* block (the one with the highest maximum row index).
6.  Let the row index of the lowest red pixel in this bottom-most block be `R_low`.
7.  Check the pixel at `(R_low, current_column)` in the input grid. If it is red (which it must be by definition), change its color to azure (8) in the output grid.
8.  Check the pixel at `(R_low - 1, current_column)` in the input grid. If this position exists (i.e., `R_low - 1 >= 0`) AND the pixel is red AND it belongs to the *same* bottom-most block (i.e., is contiguous with the pixel at `R_low`), change its color to azure (8) in the output grid.
9.  Check the pixel at `(R_low - 2, current_column)` in the input grid. If this position exists (i.e., `R_low - 2 >= 0`) AND the pixel is red AND it belongs to the *same* bottom-most block (i.e., is contiguous with the pixel at `R_low - 1`), change its color to azure (8) in the output grid.
10. After processing all columns, return the modified output grid.
