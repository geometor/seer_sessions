Only red pixels change color, becoming azure. White pixels remain white.\n3.  **Primary Objects:** The key objects appear to be vertical contiguous segments (or blocks) of red pixels within each column.\n4.  **Transformation Locus:** The changes from red to azure occur exclusively within these vertical red blocks.\n5.  **Transformation Trigger:** The change seems localized to the bottom end of these red blocks. Specifically, the lowest red pixel in the *bottom-most* red block within a column, and the two red pixels immediately above it (if they exist *within the same block*), are changed to azure.\n6.  **No Change Condition:** Red pixels that are part of a block but are more than two positions above the block's lowest pixel remain red. Red pixels in blocks that are *not* the bottom-most block in a column also remain red.\n7.  **Spatial Context:** The transformation depends solely on the vertical arrangement of red pixels within each column. The horizontal position relative to other columns or non-red pixels seems irrelevant, except for defining the column boundaries.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
