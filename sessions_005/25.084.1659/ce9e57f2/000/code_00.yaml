elements:
  - type: Grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels.
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer from 0-9 (white=0, red=2, azure=8 are relevant).
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
  - type: Vertical Red Block
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more red (2) pixels in the same column.
    properties:
      - column_index: The column the block resides in.
      - row_range: The start and end row indices of the block [min_row, max_row].
      - bottom_most: Boolean indicating if this is the lowest block in its column (max_row is highest among blocks in the same column).

actions:
  - name: Identify Vertical Red Blocks
    input: Input Grid
    output: List of Vertical Red Block objects for each column.
  - name: Filter Bottom-most Blocks
    input: List of Vertical Red Blocks for a column
    output: The single Vertical Red Block with the highest max_row in that column.
  - name: Change Color
    description: Modify the color of specific pixels from red (2) to azure (8).
    target: Red pixels within the bottom-most block at positions (max_row, col), (max_row-1, col), (max_row-2, col), provided they exist and are part of the block.

relationships:
  - type: Containment
    description: The Grid contains Pixels. Columns contain Pixels. Vertical Red Blocks consist of Pixels.
  - type: Positional
    description: Pixels have relative positions (above, below) within the same column. Blocks can be above or below other blocks in the same column.
