task_description: Transform vertical red lines by changing the color of some pixels at the bottom to azure.
grid_properties:
  - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - Background color is white (0).
  - Primary objects are vertical contiguous blocks of red (2) pixels.
objects:
  - type: block
    color: red (2)
    shape: vertical contiguous segment
    location: variable, confined within columns
action:
  - name: color_change
    input_color: red (2)
    output_color: azure (8)
    target: pixels within specific red blocks
    rule:
      - For each column independently:
          1. Find all contiguous vertical blocks of red pixels.
          2. Identify the bottom-most block (highest end row index).
          3. If no red block exists, do nothing for this column.
          4. Calculate the height 'H' of this bottom-most block.
          5. Calculate the number of pixels 'C' to change: C = floor(H / 2).
          6. Change the color of the bottom 'C' pixels of this block to azure (8).
