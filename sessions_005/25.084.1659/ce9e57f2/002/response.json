            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided code attempted to solve the task by identifying the bottom-most vertical contiguous block of red pixels in each column and changing the bottom-most 1, 2, or 3 pixels to azure, contingent on them belonging to the same block. The evaluation results show this logic is incorrect, as the number of pixels changed varies differently in the expected outputs.\n\nThe errors indicate that the rule determining *how many* pixels to change at the bottom of the identified red block was inaccurate. The code consistently tried to change up to 3 pixels, whereas the correct transformation changes a variable number of pixels based on the properties of the red block.\n\nThe strategy is to re-examine the relationship between the input red blocks and the output azure pixels in each example, focusing on the height of the relevant red block and the number of pixels converted to azure. By analyzing the height (`H`) of the bottom-most red block in each column and the number of pixels changed (`C`) in the expected output, a new rule can be derived.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between the height (`H`) of the bottom-most contiguous vertical red block in each column and the number of pixels (`C`) changed to azure from the bottom of that block in the expected outputs.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Col 1: Block `(1, 7)`, H=7. Changed pixels: `(7,1), (6,1), (5,1)`. C=3.\n    *   Col 3: Block `(3, 7)`, H=5. Changed pixels: `(7,3), (6,3)`. C=2.\n    *   Col 5: Block `(5, 7)`, H=3. Changed pixels: `(7,5)`. C=1.\n    *   Col 7: Block `(2, 7)`, H=6. Changed pixels: `(7,7), (6,7), (5,7)`. C=3.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Col 1: Block `(1, 6)`, H=6. Changed pixels: `(6,1), (5,1), (4,1)`. C=3.\n    *   Col 3: Block `(2, 6)`, H=5. Changed pixels: `(6,3), (5,3)`. C=2.\n    *   Col 5: Block `(3, 6)`, H=4. Changed pixels: `(6,5), (5,5)`. C=2.\n    *   Col 7: Block `(4, 6)`, H=3. Changed pixels: `(6,7)`. C=1.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Col 1: Block `(2, 8)`, H=7. Changed pixels: `(8,1), (7,1), (6,1)`. C=3.\n    *   Col 3: Block `(6, 8)`, H=3. Changed pixels: `(8,3)`. C=1.\n    *   Col 5: Block `(5, 8)`, H=4. Changed pixels: `(8,5), (7,5)`. C=2.\n    *   Col 7: Block `(1, 8)`, H=8. Changed pixels: `(8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7)`. C=4.\n\nSummary of (Height, Changed Pixels) pairs:\n(7, 3), (5, 2), (3, 1), (6, 3), (6, 3), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 1), (7, 3), (3, 1), (4, 2), (8, 4)\n\nPattern observed: The number of pixels changed (`C`) appears to be the floor of the block height (`H`) divided by 2: `C = floor(H / 2)`.\nLet's test this:\n*   H=3 -> floor(3/2) = 1. Correct.\n*   H=4 -> floor(4/2) = 2. Correct.\n*   H=5 -> floor(5/2) = 2. Correct.\n*   H=6 -> floor(6/2) = 3. Correct.\n*   H=7 -> floor(7/2) = 3. Correct.\n*   H=8 -> floor(8/2) = 4. Correct.\n\nThis rule holds for all observed cases.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
