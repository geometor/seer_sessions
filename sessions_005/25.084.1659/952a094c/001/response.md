"""
Identifies a rectangular frame defined by the bounding box of all non-white pixels.
Locates four distinct non-white pixels located strictly inside this frame.
Classifies these four inner pixels based on their relative positions:
Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), Bottom-Right (BR).
Removes these inner pixels (sets their original locations to white/0).
Relocates the colors of these inner pixels to new positions just outside the
corners of the frame's bounding box according to a specific mapping:
- Inner TL color moves to Outer Bottom-Right position.
- Inner TR color moves to Outer Bottom-Left position.
- Inner BL color moves to Outer Top-Right position.
- Inner BR color moves to Outer Top-Left position.
The frame itself remains unchanged.
