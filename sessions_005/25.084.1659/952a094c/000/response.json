This frame is the largest single-color object.\n    *   **Inner Pixels:** Inside the frame, there are exactly four distinct non-white pixels. These pixels have different colors from each other and potentially different from the frame color.\n    *   **Background:** The rest of the grid, both inside and outside the frame (excluding the inner pixels), is composed of white pixels (color 0).\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The frame remains unchanged in the output grid.\n    *   The four inner pixels are removed (turned white) from their original positions within the frame in the output grid.\n    *   These four inner pixels are relocated to positions *outside* the frame in the output grid.\n4.  **Relocation Pattern:** The relocation follows a specific pattern based on the relative positions of the inner pixels within the frame and the corners of the frame's bounding box.\n    *   Identify the bounding box of the frame: (min_row, min_col) to (max_row, max_col).\n    *   Identify the relative positions of the four inner pixels (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) based on their row and column indices relative to each other.\n    *   Define four target positions just outside the corners of the frame's bounding box:\n        *   Outer Top-Left (A): (min_row - 1, min_col - 1)\n        *   Outer Top-Right (B): (min_row - 1, max_col + 1)\n        *   Outer Bottom-Left (C): (max_row + 1, min_col - 1)\n        *   Outer Bottom-Right (D): (max_row + 1, max_col + 1)\n    *   The mapping is as follows:\n        *   The inner Top-Left pixel moves to the Outer Bottom-Right position (D).\n        *   The inner Top-Right pixel moves to the Outer Bottom-Left position (C).\n        *   The inner Bottom-Left pixel moves to the Outer Top-Right position (B).\n        *   The inner Bottom-Right pixel moves to the Outer Top-Left position (A).\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

The non-white pixels lying exactly on this bounding box constitute the frame.\n2.  **Identify Inner Pixels:** Locate the four non-white pixels whose coordinates (r, c) satisfy `min_row < r < max_row` and `min_col < c < max_col`. Record the color and original coordinates of each of these four inner pixels.\n3.  **Classify Inner Pixels:** Determine the relative spatial arrangement of the four inner pixels. Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices among them. Classify them as:\n    *   Inner Top-Left (TL): The pixel with the minimum row and minimum column.\n    *   Inner Top-Right (TR): The pixel with the minimum row and maximum column.\n    *   Inner Bottom-Left (BL): The pixel with the maximum row and minimum column.\n    *   Inner Bottom-Right (BR): The pixel with the maximum row and maximum column.\n4.  **Initialize Output:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.\n5.  **Remove Inner Pixels:** In the output grid, change the color of the four identified inner pixels at their original locations to white (0).\n6.  **Define Outer Positions:** Calculate the four target coordinates just outside the frame's corners:\n    *   Outer Top-Left (Pos A): (min_row - 1, min_col - 1)\n    *   Outer Top-Right (Pos B): (min_row - 1, max_col + 1)\n    *   Outer Bottom-Left (Pos C): (max_row + 1, min_col - 1)\n    *   Outer Bottom-Right (Pos D): (max_row + 1, max_col + 1)\n7.  **Relocate Pixels:** Place the colors of the inner pixels onto the calculated outer positions in the output grid according to the following mapping:\n    *   Set the pixel at Pos A to the color of the Inner BR pixel.\n    *   Set the pixel at Pos B to the color of the Inner BL pixel.\n    *   Set the pixel at Pos C to the color of the Inner TR pixel.\n    *   Set the pixel at Pos D to the color of the Inner TL pixel.\n8.  **Final Output:** The modified grid is the final output."
