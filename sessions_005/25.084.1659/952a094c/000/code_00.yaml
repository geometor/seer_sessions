objects:
  - name: frame
    description: A rectangular frame, the largest single-color non-white object. Defined by pixels on the boundary of all non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the frame pixels (uniform).
      - bounding_box: Coordinates (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
    actions:
      - remains_unchanged
  - name: inner_pixels
    description: Four distinct non-white pixels located strictly inside the frame's bounding box.
    properties:
      - count: 4
      - colors: The individual colors of the four pixels.
      - positions: The original (row, col) coordinates within the frame.
      - relative_position: Each pixel is classified as Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), or Bottom-Right (BR) relative to the other inner pixels.
    actions:
      - removed: Pixels at original positions are set to white (0).
      - relocated: Pixels are moved to new positions outside the frame.
relationships:
  - type: relocation_mapping
    description: The mapping between the relative position of an inner pixel and its new outer position.
    mapping:
      - inner_TL -> outer_BR
      - inner_TR -> outer_BL
      - inner_BL -> outer_TR
      - inner_BR -> outer_TL
  - type: position_definition
    description: Definition of the outer target positions relative to the frame's bounding box.
    definitions:
      - outer_TL: (frame.min_row - 1, frame.min_col - 1)
      - outer_TR: (frame.min_row - 1, frame.max_col + 1)
      - outer_BL: (frame.max_row + 1, frame.min_col - 1)
      - outer_BR: (frame.max_row + 1, frame.max_col + 1)
