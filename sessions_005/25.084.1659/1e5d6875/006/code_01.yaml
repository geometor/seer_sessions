facts:
  - input grids contain pixels of various colors (orange=7, red=2, gray=5, plus others).
  - output grids are the same size as input grids.
  - the transformation rule focuses on changing the color of orange (7) pixels based on their immediate neighborhood.
  - non-orange pixels in the input remain unchanged in the output.
  - the transformation rule for an orange pixel depends on the colors of its 8 adjacent neighbors (including diagonals).
  - adjacency_rule:
      type: 8-way (Moore neighborhood)
  - color_change_rule:
      input_color: orange (7)
      conditions:
        - if any neighbor is red (2): output color is green (3)
        - else if any neighbor is gray (5): output color is yellow (4)
        - otherwise: output color remains orange (7)
      priority: Red neighbor check takes precedence over gray neighbor check.
