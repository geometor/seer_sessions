task_description: Changes the color of specific orange objects based on adjacent colors, ignoring the largest orange background object.
color_map:
  7: orange
  2: red
  5: gray
  3: green
  4: yellow
objects:
  - type: contiguous block of pixels
  - primary_color: orange (7)
transformations:
  - action: identify_objects
    input: grid
    params:
      color: orange (7)
    output: list of orange objects (each a list of coordinates)
  - action: identify_largest_object
    input: list of orange objects
    params:
      metric: pixel count
    output: largest orange object (the background)
  - action: filter_objects
    input: list of orange objects
    params:
      exclude: largest orange object
    output: list of target orange objects (non-background)
  - action: conditional_color_change
    input: target orange objects
    scope: per object
    conditions:
      - priority: 1
        check: any pixel in the object is adjacent (8-way, excluding self) to a red (2) pixel
        action: change all pixels of the object to green (3)
      - priority: 2
        check: any pixel in the object is adjacent (8-way, excluding self) to a gray (5) pixel
        action: change all pixels of the object to yellow (4)
    default_action: leave object pixels as orange (7)
grid_properties:
  - background_color: The color of the largest contiguous object (if orange, it's ignored for transformation).
  - other_pixels: Pixels not part of any orange object remain unchanged.
adjacency: 8-way (includes diagonals)
priority: red (2) adjacency check takes precedence over gray (5) adjacency check.
