Lines drawn later overwrite earlier lines or background pixels. Original input pixels are NOT overwritten by lines.\n\nLet's test Hypothesis v3:\n*   Ex 1:\n    *   (0,0,9): `r=0`. No line.

Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    2.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid. Store their locations `(r, c)` and colors `k`. Let this set be `S`.\n    3.  Iterate through the input pixels `(r, c)` in `S` (order might matter, let's assume row-major for now: increasing `r`, then increasing `c`).\n    4.  For each pixel `(r, c)` with color `k`:\n        a.  Check if `r < height - 1` AND `c < width - 1`.\n        b.  If the condition in (a) is true, start drawing a line from `(r+1, c+1)` diagonally down-right.\n        c.  For each point `(curr_r, curr_c)` along the line:\n            i.  Check if `(curr_r, curr_c)` is one of the original source pixel locations in `S`.\n            ii. If it IS NOT an original source location, set `output_grid[curr_r, curr_c] = k`.\n            iii. If it IS an original source location, do nothing (preserve the original pixel).\n        d.

No, it's offset.\n    *   What if the line generation isn't from the *pixel* but from the *space* just down-right from it?\n    *   Consider pixel (r, c). Check condition (not bottom/right edge). If ok, draw starting at (r+1, c+1).\n    *   What if the line stops if it hits an *existing non-white pixel*?\n        *   (0,0,9) -> (1,1) ok, (2,2) ok, (3,3) is input 9 -> STOP line. Simulation: (1,1,9), (2,2,9).\n        *   (0,7,3) -> (1,8) ok, (2,9) is input 3 -> STOP line. Simulation: (1,8,3).\n        *   (2,6,8) -> (3,7) ok, (4,8) ok, (5,9) ok, (6,10) edge -> STOP.

Simulation: (8,2,8), (9,3,8).\n    *   Total Simulation (Hypo V5 - Stop line on non-white):\n        (0,0,9)I, (0,7,3)I, (1,1,9)L, (1,8,3)L, (2,2,9)L, (2,6,8)I, (2,9,3)I, (3,3,9)I, (3,7,8)L, (4,4,9)L, (4,8,8)L, (5,5,7)I, (5,9,8)L, (6,6,7)L, (7,1,8)I, (7,7,7)L, (8,2,8)L, (8,8,7)L, (9,3,8)L, (9,9,7)I.\n        Total = 20 pixels. Still doesn't match Expected (22 pixels). Missing (5,6,9), (6,7,9), (7,8,9), (8,9,9). Extra (1,1,9), (2,2,9).\n\n*   Let's look at the extra/missing pixels again.\n    *   Expected has line from (0,7,3) -> (1,8,3), (2,9,3).\n    *   Expected has line from (2,6,8) -> (3,7,8), (4,8,8), (5,9,8).\n    *   Expected has line from (3,3,9) -> (4,4,9), (5,5,9->OVERWRITTEN BY INPUT 7), (6,6,9), (7,7,9), (8,8,9), (9,9,9->OVERWRITTEN BY INPUT 7). No, wait. The line pixels seem to be generated independently and then superimposed, with input pixels having final say.\n    *   **Hypothesis v6:**\n        1.  Initialize output grid to all white (0).\n        2.  Identify all input non-white pixels `S = {(r, c, k)}`.\n        3.  Create a set of line pixels `L = {}`.\n        4.  For each input pixel `(r, c, k)` in `S`:\n            a.  Check if `r < height - 1` AND `c < width - 1`.\n            b.  If true, generate line points `(curr_r, curr_c)` starting from `(r+1, c+1)` down-right until edge.\n            c.  For each generated point `(curr_r, curr_c)`, add `(curr_r, curr_c, k)` to the set `L`. If a point `(curr_r, curr_c)` is added multiple times (from different sources), the one added *last* (based on row-major iteration of sources) takes precedence.\n        5.  Populate the output grid:\n            a.  First, place all line pixels from `L` onto the grid. If multiple colors land on the same spot, the last one written wins.\n            b.  Second, place all original input pixels `(r, c, k)` from `S` onto the grid, overwriting any line pixels at those locations.\n\nLet's simulate Ex 1 with Hypothesis v6:\n1.  Output = white. `S = {(0,0,9), (0,7,3), (2,6,8), (2,9,3), (3,3,9), (5,5,7), (7,1,8), (9,9,7)}`. `L = {}`.\n2.  (0,0,9): Gen line (1,1,9)...(9,9,9). Add to L. `L` has 9 points.\n3.
