Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid. Store their locations (r, c) and colors k. Let S be the set of these source pixels.\n3. Create a temporary layer (e.g., a dictionary mapping coordinates to colors) to store the pixels generated by diagonal lines.\n4. Iterate through the source pixels (r, c) in S, processing them in row-major order (top to bottom, left to right).\n5. For each source pixel (r, c) with color k, check if it is not on the bottom edge (r < height - 1) and not on the right edge (c < width - 1).\n6. If the condition in step 5 is met, generate a sequence of points (curr_r, curr_c) starting from (r+1, c+1) and moving diagonally down-right (incrementing both r and c) until either curr_r reaches the grid height or curr_c reaches the grid width.\n7. For each point (curr_r, curr_c) generated in step 6, record its color k in the temporary layer. If a point is generated multiple times (by lines from different source pixels), the color from the source pixel processed later (due to row-major order) will overwrite previous colors for that point in the temporary layer.\n8. Populate the output grid: First, copy all pixels from the temporary layer (the generated lines) into the output grid.\n9. Finally, iterate through the original source pixels S again and place their colors k at their original locations (r, c) in the output grid, overwriting any line pixels that might be at those locations.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n    \n    # Initialize output grid with white (0)\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_np)\n    \n    # 1.
