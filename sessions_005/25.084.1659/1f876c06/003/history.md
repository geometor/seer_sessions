**Analysis of Metrics:**

The revised analysis confirms the hypothesis.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Pixels: 8, Output Pixels: 22, Added: 14
    *   Line Generators: `[(0, 7), (2, 6), (3, 3), (5, 5), (7, 1)]`. Wait, the code output includes `(0, 0)` as a generator. Let me re-check Ex1 output. Expected output for (0,0,9) has ONLY 9 at (0,0). My code logic `is_generator = True` if *any* line pixel exists. Let me refine the analysis code slightly to match the exact hypothesis.
    *   Non-Line Generators: `[(0, 0), (2, 9), (9, 9)]`. Code output says `[(2, 9), (9, 9)]`.
    *   Sources on Edge: `[(2, 9), (9, 9)]`.
    *   Okay, the analysis code needs one more tweak. The condition is `if r_in < height - 1 and c_in < width - 1`. Let's apply this strictly.

*   **Retesting Analysis Code Logic:**
    *   Ex 1:
        *   (0,0): `r=0, c=0`. `0 < 9` and `0 < 9`. Condition met. Does it generate a line in expected output? No. Hypothesis seems slightly off, or my analysis of Ex1 output is wrong. Let's re-examine Expected Output 1:
            
```
            9 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0  <- Input (0,0,9)
            0 0* 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0  <- Added (1,8,3) from (0,7,3)
            0 0 0* 0 0 0 8 0 0 3  <- Input (2,6,8), Input (2,9,3), Added (2,9,3) from (0,7,3) NO, Added (2,5,?) NO. Added (2,9,3) comes from (1,8,3) which comes from (0,7,3). This matches.
            0 0 0 9 0 0* 0 8 0 0  <- Input (3,3,9), Added (3,7,8) from (2,6,8)
            0 0 0 0 9 0* 0 0 8 0  <- Added (4,4,9) from (3,3,9), Added (4,8,8) from (3,7,8) from (2,6,8)
            0 0 0 0 0 7 9* 0 0 8  <- Input (5,5,7), Added (5,6,9) from (4,4,9) from (3,3,9), Added (5,9,8) from (4,8,8) ... from (2,6,8)
            0 0 0 0* 0 0 7 9 0 0  <- Added (6,2,8) from (?), Added (6,6,7) from (5,5,7), Added (6,7,9) from (5,6,9)... from (3,3,9)
            0 8 0 0* 0 0 0 7 9 0  <- Input (7,1,8), Added (7,3,?) NO. Added (7,7,7) from (6,6,7)... from (5,5,7), Added (7,8,9) from (6,7,9)... from (3,3,9)
            0 0 8 0* 0 0 0 0 7 9  <- Added (8,2,8) from (7,1,8), Added (8,8,7) from (7,7,7)... from (5,5,7), Added (8,9,9) from (7,8,9)... from (3,3,9)
            0 0* 0 8* 0 0 0 0 0 7  <- Input (9,9,7), Added (9,3,8) from (8,2,8)... from (7,1,8), Added (9,8,7) NO Added (9,9,7) from (8,8,7)... NO. Added (9,9,9) NO (9,9,7) is input. Added (9,8,?)
            ```

        *   Okay, tracing the lines carefully:
            *   (0,0,9) -> No line. It meets `r < H-1` and `c < W-1`. Why no line?
            *   (0,7,3) -> Line: (1,8,3), (2,9,3). Yes.
            *   (2,6,8) -> Line: (3,7,8), (4,8,8), (5,9,8). Yes.
            *   (2,9,3) -> No line. On right edge. Correct.
            *   (3,3,9) -> Line: (4,4,9), (5,5,9), (6,6,9), (7,7,9), (8,8,9), (9,9,9). Wait, expected has (5,5,7) and (9,9,7). There's overlap! The lines seem to overwrite existing pixels *unless* the existing pixel is the source pixel itself? No, the source pixels are always preserved. Pixels along the line path seem to be overwritten.
            *   Let's re-examine Ex1 Output, focusing on (3,3,9)'s line path:
                *   (4,4): Should be 9. Expected has 9.
                *   (5,5): Should be 9. Expected has 7 (from input (5,5,7)).
                *   (6,6): Should be 9. Expected has 7 (from (5,5,7)'s line).
                *   (7,7): Should be 9. Expected has 7 (from (5,5,7)'s line).
                *   (8,8): Should be 9. Expected has 7 (from (5,5,7)'s line).
                *   (9,9): Should be 9. Expected has 7 (from input (9,9,7)).
            *   This suggests an OVERWRITE rule. When drawing a line, it overwrites whatever is in the grid EXCEPT for the original source pixels.
            *   Let's re-evaluate (0,0,9). Why no line? If it drew a line, it would be 9s at (1,1), (2,2), ... (9,9). These clash with pixels from (3,3,9), (5,5,7), (7,1,8). Is there a priority? Maybe pixels with higher row/col index draw their lines last and overwrite?
                *   Process order by row, then col?
                *   (0,0,9): Draw line 9s down-right. Grid is now populated.
                *   (0,7,3): Draw line 3s down-right. Overwrites any 9s? Yes.
                *   (2,6,8): Draw line 8s down-right. Overwrites 9s and 3s? Yes.
                *   (2,9,3): No line (edge).
                *   (3,3,9): Draw line 9s down-right. Overwrites 8s, 3s? Yes.
                *   (5,5,7): Draw line 7s down-right. Overwrites 9s? Yes.
                *   (7,1,8): Draw line 8s down-right. Overwrites 9s, 7s? Yes.
                *   (9,9,7): No line (edge).
            *   Let's simulate this for Ex 1:
                1.  Start with input grid.
                2.  (0,0,9): Meets condition. Draw 9s at (1,1) to (9,9).
                3.  (0,7,3): Meets condition. Draw 3s at (1,8), (2,9).
                4.  (2,6,8): Meets condition. Draw 8s at (3,7), (4,8), (5,9).
                5.  (3,3,9): Meets condition. Draw 9s at (4,4) to (9,9). *Overwrites previous (4,4)=9, (5,5)=9, (6,6)=9, (7,7)=9, (8,8)=9, (9,9)=9. Also overwrites (4,8)=8, (5,9)=8.*
                6.  (5,5,7): Meets condition. Draw 7s at (6,6) to (9,9). *Overwrites (6,6)=9, (7,7)=9, (8,8)=9, (9,9)=9.*
                7.  (7,1,8): Meets condition. Draw 8s at (8,2), (9,3).
            *   Final state based on this simulation vs Expected:
                
```
                Simulated Grid (Non-white only):
                (0,0,9) - Input
                (0,7,3) - Input
                (1,8,3) - Line from (0,7)
                (2,6,8) - Input
                (2,9,3) - Input & Line from (0,7) -> 3
                (3,3,9) - Input
                (3,7,8) - Line from (2,6)
                (4,4,9) - Line from (3,3)
                (4,8,9) - Was 8 from (2,6), overwritten by 9 from (3,3)
                (5,5,9) - Line from (3,3) -> 9. But Input is (5,5,7)! Does input take precedence?
                (5,9,9) - Was 8 from (2,6), overwritten by 9 from (3,3)
                (6,6,7) - Was 9 from (3,3), overwritten by 7 from (5,5)
                (7,1,8) - Input
                (7,7,7) - Was 9 from (3,3), overwritten by 7 from (5,5)
                (8,2,8) - Line from (7,1)
                (8,8,7) - Was 9 from (3,3), overwritten by 7 from (5,5)
                (9,3,8) - Line from (7,1)
                (9,9,7) - Was 9 from (3,3), overwritten by 7 from (5,5). Input is (9,9,7). Matches.
                ```

            *   This simulation still doesn't match the expected output perfectly. E.g., expected (5,5) is 7 (input), (6,6) is 7 (line from 5,5), (7,7) is 7 (line from 5,5), (8,8) is 7 (line from 5,5), (9,9) is 7 (input). My simulation had 9s being overwritten by 7s correctly.
            *   What about (0,0,9)? My simulation drew a line. Expected has no line. Why? Is the condition more complex?
            *   Maybe the line only gets drawn if the path is clear? No, overwriting seems necessary.
            *   Could the condition `r < H-1 and c < W-1` be wrong?
                *   Ex1 non-generators: (0,0,9), (2,9,3), (9,9,7). (0,0,9) is the outlier.
                *   Ex2 non-generators: (0,2,2), (2,0,2), (4,9,6), (9,7,4). Outliers: (0,2,2), (2,0,2).
                *   Ex3 non-generators: (3,0,6), (4,9,8), (9,0,9). Outliers: None that aren't on an edge.
            *   What's special about (0,0,9) in Ex1, (0,2,2) in Ex2, (2,0,2) in Ex2?
                *   (0,0,9) Ex1: Top-left corner.
                *   (0,2,2) Ex2: Top edge.
                *   (2,0,2) Ex2: Left edge.
            *   Maybe the condition is NOT being on the TOP or LEFT edge either?
            *   Hypothesis v3: For each non-white pixel at `(r, c)` with color `k`, keep the pixel at `(r, c)`. If the pixel is *not* on the top edge (`r > 0`), *not* on the left edge (`c > 0`), *not* on the bottom edge (`r < height - 1`), AND *not* on the right edge (`c < width - 1`), then draw a line of color `k` starting from `(r+1, c+1)` diagonally down and right until the grid edge (bottom or right) is hit. Lines drawn later overwrite earlier lines or background pixels. Original input pixels are NOT overwritten by lines.

Let's test Hypothesis v3:
*   Ex 1:
    *   (0,0,9): `r=0`. No line. Correct.
    *   (0,7,3): `r=0`. No line. INCORRECT. Expected has line.
    *   (2,6,8): `r>0, c>0, r<H-1, c<W-1`. Yes. Line generated.
    *   (2,9,3): `c=W-1`. No line. Correct.
    *   (3,3,9): `r>0, c>0, r<H-1, c<W-1`. Yes. Line generated.
    *   (5,5,7): `r>0, c>0, r<H-1, c<W-1`. Yes. Line generated.
    *   (7,1,8): `r>0, c>0, r<H-1, c<W-1`. Yes. Line generated.
    *   (9,9,7): `r=H-1`. No line. Correct.
*   Hypothesis v3 fails on (0,7,3) for Ex1.

Let's reconsider the original "down-right if not on bottom/right edge" idea, but add the overwrite logic and preservation of input pixels.

*   **Hypothesis v4:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid. Store their locations `(r, c)` and colors `k`. Let this set be `S`.
    3.  Iterate through the input pixels `(r, c)` in `S` (order might matter, let's assume row-major for now: increasing `r`, then increasing `c`).
    4.  For each pixel `(r, c)` with color `k`:
        a.  Check if `r < height - 1` AND `c < width - 1`.
        b.  If the condition in (a) is true, start drawing a line from `(r+1, c+1)` diagonally down-right.
        c.  For each point `(curr_r, curr_c)` along the line:
            i.  Check if `(curr_r, curr_c)` is one of the original source pixel locations in `S`.
            ii. If it IS NOT an original source location, set `output_grid[curr_r, curr_c] = k`.
            iii. If it IS an original source location, do nothing (preserve the original pixel).
        d.  Stop drawing when `curr_r` reaches `height` or `curr_c` reaches `width`.

Let's try simulating Ex 1 with Hypothesis v4:
1.  Output = Input. `S = {(0,0,9), (0,7,3), (2,6,8), (2,9,3), (3,3,9), (5,5,7), (7,1,8), (9,9,7)}`

Let's compare this final simulated grid state with Expected Output 1:
*   Simulated: (0,0,9), (0,7,3), (1,1,9), (1,8,3), (2,2,9), (2,6,8), (2,9,3), (3,3,9), (3,7,8), (4,4,9), (4,8,8), (5,5,7), (5,9,8), (6,6,7), (7,1,8), (7,7,7), (8,2,8), (8,8,7), (9,3,8), (9,9,7) - Total 20 pixels.
*   Expected: (0,0,9), (0,7,3), (1,8,3), (2,6,8), (2,9,3), (3,3,9), (3,7,8), (4,4,9), (4,8,8), (5,5,7), (5,6,9)? No (5,6) (5,9,8), (6,2,8)? No (6,2), (6,6,7), (7,1,8), (7,7,7), (8,2,8), (8,8,7), (9,3,8), (9,9,7) - Plus others? Let's list all non-zero from expected:
    *   (0,0,9), (0,7,3)
    *   (1,8,3)
    *   (2,6,8), (2,9,3)
    *   (3,3,9), (3,7,8)
    *   (4,4,9), (4,8,8)
    *   (5,5,7), (5,6,9)?, (5,9,8) -> Where did (5,6,9) come from? Ah, I misread the expected grid image. Let me transcribe carefully.

    ```

    *   Comparing again: My simulation (Hypo V4) produced:
        (0,0,9), (0,7,3), (1,1,9)NO, (1,8,3)YES, (2,2,9)NO, (2,6,8)YES, (2,9,3)YES, (3,3,9)YES, (3,7,8)YES, (4,4,9)YES, (4,8,8)YES, (5,5,7)YES, (5,9,8)YES, (6,6,7)YES, (7,1,8)YES, (7,7,7)YES, (8,2,8)YES, (8,8,7)YES, (9,3,8)YES, (9,9,7)YES
    *   Missing from simulation: (5,6,9), (6,7,9), (7,8,9), (8,9,9). These seem to form a line from (4,4,9) which came from (3,3,9).
    *   Extra in simulation: (1,1,9), (2,2,9). These came from (0,0,9).
    *   Why did (0,0,9) generate a line in my simulation but not in the expected output? Why did the line from (3,3,9) seem to continue in the expected output [(4,4)->(5,6)? No, (4,4)->(5,5) is input -> (6,6) -> (7,7) -> (8,8) -> (9,9) is input]. But expected output shows (5,6,9), (6,7,9), (7,8,9), (8,9,9). This looks like a line starting from (4,5)? Or (3,4)? No, it's offset.
    *   What if the line generation isn't from the *pixel* but from the *space* just down-right from it?
    *   Consider pixel (r, c). Check condition (not bottom/right edge). If ok, draw starting at (r+1, c+1).
    *   What if the line stops if it hits an *existing non-white pixel*?
        *   (0,0,9) -> (1,1) ok, (2,2) ok, (3,3) is input 9 -> STOP line. Simulation: (1,1,9), (2,2,9).
        *   (0,7,3) -> (1,8) ok, (2,9) is input 3 -> STOP line. Simulation: (1,8,3).
        *   (2,6,8) -> (3,7) ok, (4,8) ok, (5,9) ok, (6,10) edge -> STOP. Simulation: (3,7,8), (4,8,8), (5,9,8).
        *   (3,3,9) -> (4,4) ok, (5,5) is input 7 -> STOP line. Simulation: (4,4,9).
        *   (5,5,7) -> (6,6) ok, (7,7) ok, (8,8) ok, (9,9) is input 7 -> STOP line. Simulation: (6,6,7), (7,7,7), (8,8,7).
        *   (7,1,8) -> (8,2) ok, (9,3) ok, (10,4) edge -> STOP. Simulation: (8,2,8), (9,3,8).
    *   Total Simulation (Hypo V5 - Stop line on non-white):
        (0,0,9)I, (0,7,3)I, (1,1,9)L, (1,8,3)L, (2,2,9)L, (2,6,8)I, (2,9,3)I, (3,3,9)I, (3,7,8)L, (4,4,9)L, (4,8,8)L, (5,5,7)I, (5,9,8)L, (6,6,7)L, (7,1,8)I, (7,7,7)L, (8,2,8)L, (8,8,7)L, (9,3,8)L, (9,9,7)I.
        Total = 20 pixels. Still doesn't match Expected (22 pixels). Missing (5,6,9), (6,7,9), (7,8,9), (8,9,9). Extra (1,1,9), (2,2,9).

*   Let's look at the extra/missing pixels again.
    *   Expected has line from (0,7,3) -> (1,8,3), (2,9,3).
    *   Expected has line from (2,6,8) -> (3,7,8), (4,8,8), (5,9,8).
    *   Expected has line from (3,3,9) -> (4,4,9), (5,5,9->OVERWRITTEN BY INPUT 7), (6,6,9), (7,7,9), (8,8,9), (9,9,9->OVERWRITTEN BY INPUT 7). No, wait. The line pixels seem to be generated independently and then superimposed, with input pixels having final say.
    *   **Hypothesis v6:**
        1.  Initialize output grid to all white (0).
        2.  Identify all input non-white pixels `S = {(r, c, k)}`.
        3.  Create a set of line pixels `L = {}`.
        4.  For each input pixel `(r, c, k)` in `S`:
            a.  Check if `r < height - 1` AND `c < width - 1`.
            b.  If true, generate line points `(curr_r, curr_c)` starting from `(r+1, c+1)` down-right until edge.
            c.  For each generated point `(curr_r, curr_c)`, add `(curr_r, curr_c, k)` to the set `L`. If a point `(curr_r, curr_c)` is added multiple times (from different sources), the one added *last* (based on row-major iteration of sources) takes precedence.
        5.  Populate the output grid:
            a.  First, place all line pixels from `L` onto the grid. If multiple colors land on the same spot, the last one written wins.
            b.  Second, place all original input pixels `(r, c, k)` from `S` onto the grid, overwriting any line pixels at those locations.

Let's simulate Ex 1 with Hypothesis v6:
1.  Output = white. `S = {(0,0,9), (0,7,3), (2,6,8), (2,9,3), (3,3,9), (5,5,7), (7,1,8), (9,9,7)}`. `L = {}`.
2.  (0,0,9): Gen line (1,1,9)...(9,9,9). Add to L. `L` has 9 points.
3.  (0,7,3): Gen line (1,8,3), (2,9,3). Add to L. `L` now has 11 points.
4.  (2,6,8): Gen line (3,7,8), (4,8,8), (5,9,8). Add to L. `L` has 14 points.
5.  (2,9,3): Edge. Skip.
6.  (3,3,9): Gen line (4,4,9)...(9,9,9). Add to L.
    *   (4,4,9) overwrites nothing.
    *   (5,5,9) overwrites (5,5,9) from (0,0).
    *   (6,6,9) overwrites (6,6,9) from (0,0).
    *   (7,7,9) overwrites (7,7,9) from (0,0).
    *   (8,8,9) overwrites (8,8,9) from (0,0).
    *   (9,9,9) overwrites (9,9,9) from (0,0).
    `L` still has 14 unique coordinate points, but colors updated.
7.  (5,5,7): Gen line (6,6,7)...(9,9,7). Add to L.
    *   (6,6,7) overwrites (6,6,9) from (3,3).
    *   (7,7,7) overwrites (7,7,9) from (3,3).
    *   (8,8,7) overwrites (8,8,9) from (3,3).
    *   (9,9,7) overwrites (9,9,9) from (3,3).
    `L` still has 14 unique coordinate points, colors updated.
8.  (7,1,8): Gen line (8,2,8), (9,3,8). Add to L. `L` has 16 points.
9.  (9,9,7): Edge. Skip.
10. Final `L` points and colors (coords sorted): (1,1,9), (1,8,3), (2,2,9), (2,9,3), (3,7,8), (4,4,9), (4,8,8), (5,5,9), (5,9,8), (6,6,7), (7,7,7), (8,2,8), (8,8,7), (9,3,8), (9,9,7). Wait, I missed (6,6) to (9,9) from (0,0) earlier. Let's retrace L carefully.
    *   From (0,0,9): L = {(1,1,9), (2,2,9), (3,3,9), (4,4,9), (5,5,9), (6,6,9), (7,7,9), (8,8,9), (9,9,9)}
    *   From (0,7,3): L = L U {(1,8,3), (2,9,3)}
    *   From (2,6,8
