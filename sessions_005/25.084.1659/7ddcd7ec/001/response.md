"""
Identifies the single connected object of a non-white color in the input grid.
Finds the lowest pixel(s) of this object.
Determines the direction of diagonal extension (down-right or down-left) based on the horizontal position of the lowest pixel(s) relative to the pixel(s) in the row immediately above within the same object.
Extends a diagonal line of the object's color downwards from the position determined by the lowest pixel and the calculated direction, until the grid boundary is reached.
The output grid contains the original object plus the extended diagonal line.
