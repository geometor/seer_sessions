"""
Identifies the single connected object of a non-white color in the input grid.
Finds the highest and lowest pixels (or rows containing them) of this object.

Determines the direction of downward diagonal extension (down-right or down-left).
This is based on the horizontal position of a representative lowest pixel 
relative to all pixels in the row immediately above it within the same object.
- If the lowest pixel's column index is greater than the column indices of all 
  pixels in the row above, the direction is down-right (+1 in column index).
- If the lowest pixel's column index is less than the column indices of all 
  pixels in the row above, the direction is down-left (-1 in column index).
- Otherwise, or if there's no row above within the object, there is no downward 
  extension (direction 0).

Determines the direction of upward diagonal extension (up-right or up-left).
This is based on the horizontal position of a representative highest pixel 
relative to all pixels in the row immediately below it within the same object.
- If the highest pixel's column index is greater than the column indices of all 
  pixels in the row below, the direction is up-right (+1 in column index).
- If the highest pixel's column index is less than the column indices of all 
  pixels in the row below, the direction is up-left (-1 in column index).
- Otherwise, or if there's no row below within the object, there is no upward 
  extension (direction 0).

Extends a diagonal line of the object's color downwards starting from the row 
below the lowest pixel(s), using the determined downward direction, until the 
grid boundary is reached. The starting column is derived from the representative 
lowest pixel's column and the direction.

Extends a diagonal line of the object's color upwards starting from the row 
above the highest pixel(s), using the determined upward direction, until the 
grid boundary is reached. The starting column is derived from the representative 
highest pixel's column and the direction.

The output grid contains the original object plus both extended diagonal lines 
(if applicable).
