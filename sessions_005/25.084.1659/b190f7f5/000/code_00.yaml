task_context:
  description: Scale each non-white pixel in the input grid into a 3x3 pattern in the output grid.
  grid_size_relation: Output grid dimensions are 3 times the input grid dimensions.
  background_color: white (0) remains the background.

transformation:
  type: pixel-wise scaling with pattern replacement
  scale_factor: 3x3
  operations:
    - description: Iterate through each pixel (r, c) in the input grid.
    - input_pixel: pixel at (r, c) with color C
    - output_block: 3x3 area in the output grid starting at (3*r, 3*c)
    - conditions:
      - if C is white (0):
          action: Fill the corresponding output_block with white (0).
      - if C is non-white:
          action: Fill the corresponding output_block with a specific pattern based on color C.
          pattern: |
            [[0, C, 0],
             [C, C, C],
             [0, C, 0]]
