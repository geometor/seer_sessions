(Input (3,6) -> Output (9,18); Input (4,8) -> Output (12,24)). The previous code correctly implemented this scaling.\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   The *expected* outputs never contain the azure color (8), even though it is present in all inputs.\n    *   The *transformed* outputs (from the previous code) incorrectly contain azure (8).\n    *   The counts of other non-white colors (1, 2, 3, 4) in the expected outputs are consistently 5 times the count of that color in the corresponding input (because each input pixel maps to a 5-pixel plus sign).\n    *   The count of white (0) in the expected output is `(output_height * output_width) - (sum of non-white input counts * 5)`. This accounts for the 3x3 white blocks generated from input white pixels AND the 3x3 white blocks generated from input azure pixels.\n    *   The previous code produced the correct number of pixels for colors 1, 2, 3, and 4, but incorrectly produced azure pixels (5 times the input count of azure) instead of white pixels.\n\nThis confirms the hypothesis: the transformation involves 3x scaling, where each input pixel maps to a 3x3 output block. White maps to all white. Azure (8) maps to all white. All other non-white colors map to a plus sign (+) of that color within the 3x3 block.## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the 3x scaling aspect of the transformation but failed to recognize the specific rule differentiation for the azure color (8). The code applied a plus-sign transformation to *all* non-white input pixels, whereas the examples show that azure pixels should be transformed into 3x3 white blocks, just like the background white pixels. The transformation rule for other non-white colors (mapping to a plus sign of the same color) appears correct.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the transformation logic to handle the azure color (8) as a special case, mapping it to white (0), while retaining the plus-sign mapping for all other non-white colors.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics gathered using `tool_code`:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Shape: (3, 6)\n*   Input Colors: {0: 9, 1: 2, 2: 1, 4: 2, 8: 4}\n*   Expected Output Shape: (9, 18)\n*   Expected Output Colors: {0: 137, 1: 10, 2: 5, 4: 10} (Note: 8 is absent)\n*   Transformed Output Shape: (9, 18)\n*   Transformed Output Colors: {0: 117, 1: 10, 2: 5, 4: 10, 8: 20} (Note: 8 is present, count of 0 is lower)\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Shape: (3, 6)\n*   Input Colors: {0: 10, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1, 8: 5}\n*   Expected Output Shape: (9, 18)\n*   Expected Output Colors: {0: 147, 2: 5, 3: 5, 4: 5} (Note: 8 is absent)\n*   Transformed Output Shape: (9, 18)\n*   Transformed Output Colors: {0: 122, 2: 5, 3: 5, 4: 5, 8: 25} (Note: 8 is present, count of 0 is lower)\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input Shape: (4, 8)\n*   Input Colors: {0: 17, 2: 4, 4: 4, 8: 7}\n*   Expected Output Shape: (12, 24)\n*   Expected Output Colors: {0: 248, 2: 20, 4: 20} (Note: 8 is absent)\n*   Transformed Output Shape: (12, 24)\n*   Transformed Output Colors: {0: 213, 2: 20, 4: 20, 8: 35} (Note: 8 is present, count of 0 is lower)\n\n**Observations from Metrics:**\n1.  **Scaling:** Output grid dimensions are consistently 3 times the input grid dimensions.\n2.  **Color Mapping:** Azure (8) pixels in the input consistently map to white (0) pixels in the output. The number of azure pixels in the input corresponds to an equivalent increase in white pixels in the output (relative to the previous incorrect transformation). Specifically, each input azure pixel contributes 9 white pixels to the output count.\n3.  **Pattern Mapping:** Non-white, non-azure pixels (1, 2, 3, 4) in the input consistently map to a 5-pixel plus sign (+) shape of the same color in the output. This is confirmed by the output color counts being 5 times the input counts for these colors.\n4.  **White Mapping:** White (0) pixels in the input map to a 3x3 block of white pixels in the output.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
