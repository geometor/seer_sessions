task_description: Upscales an input grid by a factor of 3x3, mapping each input pixel to a 3x3 block in the output grid based on the input pixel's color.
grid_properties:
  - Input and output grids are 2D arrays of integers (colors 0-9).
  - Output grid dimensions are exactly 3 times the input grid dimensions (Height_out = Height_in * 3, Width_out = Width_in * 3).
objects:
  - identifier: pixel
    description: Each cell in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: An integer from 0-9.
transformation:
  - name: upscale_and_pattern_map
    description: Maps each input pixel to a 3x3 output block.
    mapping_rules:
      - condition: Input pixel color is white (0) or azure (8).
        action: The corresponding 3x3 output block is filled entirely with white (0).
      - condition: Input pixel color is any color other than white (0) or azure (8).
        action:
          - The corresponding 3x3 output block is initialized to white (0).
          - A plus (+) shape is drawn within the 3x3 block using the input pixel's color.
          - The plus shape consists of the center pixel, the pixel directly above, below, left, and right of the center.
    output_properties:
      - The output grid never contains the azure (8) color.
