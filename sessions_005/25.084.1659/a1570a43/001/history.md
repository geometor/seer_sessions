*   Number of red pixels: 12 in train_1, 13 in train_2. This is a difference!
*   **Hypothesis Revised:**
    1. Find the top-leftmost green pixel at `(r1, c1)`.
    2. Count the number of red pixels, `N_red`.
    3. If `N_red` is even: `dy = r1 + 1`, `dx = c1 + 0`.
    4. If `N_red` is odd: `dy = r1 + 0`, `dx = c1 + 1`.
    5. Translate the red shape by `(dy, dx)`.
*   Let's check this hypothesis:
    *   **train_1:** `(r1, c1) = (1, 1)`. `N_red = 12` (even). Shift should be `dy = 1+1=2`, `dx = 1+0=1`. -> `(+2, +1)`. **Matches.**
    *   **train_2:** `(r1, c1) = (1, 1)`. `N_red = 13` (odd). Shift should be `dy = 1+0=1`, `dx = 1+1=2`. -> `(+1, +2)`. **Matches.**
    *   **train_3:** `(r1, c1) = (0, 0)`. Need `N_red`.
    *   **train_4:** `(r1, c1) = (0, 0)`. Need `N_red`.

*   **Check train_3:** `(r1, c1) = (0, 0)`. `N_red = 11` (odd). Shift should be `dy = 0+0=0`, `dx = 0+1=1`. -> `(0, +1)`. **Does NOT match** the observed shift `(+1, +1)`.
*   **Check train_4:** `(r1, c1) = (0, 0)`. `N_red = 11` (odd). Shift should be `dy = 0+0=0`, `dx = 0+1=1`. -> `(0, +1)`. **Does NOT match** the observed shift `(+1, +1)`.

*   **Backtrack:** The hypothesis linking parity of red pixels to the shift calculation doesn't hold for train_3 and train_4.
*   Let's reconsider the rule derivation based on `(r1, c1)`.
    *   Case `(r1, c1) = (0, 0)` -> Shift `(+1, +1)`. This is `(r1+1, c1+1)`.
    *   Case `(r1, c1) = (1, 1)` -> Shifts `(+2, +1)` or `(+1, +2)`.
        *   Train 1 (`N_red=12`, even): Shift `(+2, +1)`. This is `(r1+1, c1+0)`.
        *   Train 2 (`N_red=13`, odd): Shift `(+1, +2)`. This is `(r1+0, c1+1)`.

*   **Revised Hypothesis 2:**
    1.  Find the top-leftmost green pixel at `(r1, c1)`.
    2.  If `(r1, c1) == (0, 0)`: `dy = 1`, `dx = 1`.
    3.  If `(r1, c1) == (1, 1)`:
        *   Count the number of red pixels, `N_red`.
        *   If `N_red` is even: `dy = 2`, `dx = 1`.
        *   If `N_red` is odd: `dy = 1`, `dx = 2`.
    4.  Translate the red shape by `(dy, dx)`.

*   Let's re-check this:
    *   **train_1:** `(r1, c1) = (1, 1)`. `N_red = 12` (even). Rule gives `dy=2, dx=1`. Shift `(+2, +1)`. **Matches.**
    *   **train_2:** `(r1, c1) = (1, 1)`. `N_red = 13` (odd). Rule gives `dy=1, dx=2`. Shift `(+1, +2)`. **Matches.**
    *   **train_3:** `(r1, c1) = (0, 0)`. Rule gives `dy=1, dx=1`. Shift `(+1, +1)`. **Matches.**
    *   **train_4:** `(r1, c1) = (0, 0)`. Rule gives `dy=1, dx=1`. Shift `(+1, +1)`. **Matches.**

*   This revised hypothesis seems consistent across all examples. The core idea is that the translation vector depends on the position of the top-left green pixel, and *in one specific case* (when the top-left green pixel is at (1,1)), the parity of the red pixel count further modifies the vector.

**Summary of Transformation:**
1.  Identify all red (2) and green (3) pixels.
2.  The green pixels remain unchanged in the output grid.
3.  Find the coordinates `(r1, c1)` of the green pixel with the minimum row index, and among those, the minimum column index (the top-leftmost green pixel).
4.  Determine the translation vector `(dy, dx)` based on `(r1, c1)`:
    *   If `(r1, c1)` is `(0, 0)`, then `dy = 1` and `dx = 1`.
    *   If `(r1, c1)` is `(1, 1)`, then:
        *   Count the total number of red pixels (`N_red`) in the input grid.
        *   If `N_red` is even, then `dy = 2` and `dx = 1`.
        *   If `N_red` is odd, then `dy = 1` and `dx = 2`.
    *   (Need to consider if other `(r1, c1)` values are possible, but based on examples, these seem to be the only cases).
5.  Create the output grid, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
6.  Copy the green pixels from the input to their same locations in the output grid.
7.  For every red pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid, place a red pixel at `(r + dy, c + dx)` in the output grid. Ensure the new coordinates are within the grid bounds.

This looks like a complete and consistent rule.**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Elements:** The grids contain a background of white pixels (0), four green pixels (3), and a shape composed of red pixels (2).
2.  **Static Elements:** The four green pixels remain in the exact same positions in the output as they were in the input.
3.  **Dynamic Elements:** The shape formed by the red pixels is translated (moved) to a new position in the output grid. The shape itself is preserved.
4.  **Green Pixel Configuration:** The green pixels always form a rectangle (or square). In some examples, the top-left green pixel is at `(0, 0)`, while in others, it's at `(1, 1)`.
5.  **Transformation Driver:** The amount and direction of the red shape's translation `(dy, dx)` seem to depend on the position of the top-leftmost green pixel. Additionally, when the top-left green pixel is at `(1, 1)`, the parity (even or odd) of the total count of red pixels influences the specific translation vector.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Find the coordinates of all green pixels (3) in the input grid. Copy these green pixels to the same coordinates in the output grid.
3.  Identify the green pixel that has the minimum row index. If there's a tie, choose the one among them with the minimum column index. Let its coordinates be `(r1, c1)`.
4.  Determine the vertical shift `dy` and horizontal shift `dx` based on `(r1, c1)`:
    *   If `r1` is 0 and `c1` is 0, set `dy = 1` and `dx = 1`.
    *   If `r1` is 1 and `c1` is 1, then count the total number of red pixels (2) in the input grid.
        *   If the count of red pixels is an even number, set `dy = 2` and `dx = 1`.
        *   If the count of red pixels is an odd number, set `dy = 1` and `dx = 2`.
5.  Find the coordinates `(r, c)` of all red pixels (2) in the input grid.
6.  For each red pixel found at `(r, c)` in the input, place a red pixel in the output grid at the new coordinates `(r + dy, c + dx)`.
