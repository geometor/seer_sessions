  Transforms the input grid by translating a red object based on the position 
  of the top-left green marker pixel and, in specific cases, the parity of the 
  red object's size.

  Steps:
  1. Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
  2. Find all green pixels (3) and copy them to the output grid at the same locations.
  3. Find the top-leftmost green pixel (min row, then min col), let its coordinates be (r1, c1).
  4. Determine the translation vector (dy, dx) based on (r1, c1):
     - If (r1, c1) == (0, 0): dy = 1, dx = 1.
     - If (r1, c1) == (1, 1):
       - Count the total number of red pixels (2), N_red.
       - If N_red is even: dy = 2, dx = 1.
       - If N_red is odd: dy = 1, dx = 2.
  5. Find all red pixels (2) in the input grid.
  6. For each red pixel at (r, c), place a red pixel in the output grid at (r + dy, c + dx), 
     ensuring the new coordinates are within the grid bounds.
