Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).\n2.  Identify all green pixels (color 3) in the input grid. These act as markers. Copy these green pixels to the output grid at their original locations.\n3.  Find the coordinate (r1, c1) of the green pixel with the minimum row index, and then the minimum column index among those (the top-leftmost green marker).\n4.  Identify all red pixels (color 2) in the input grid, forming a single connected object. Count the total number of red pixels, N_red.\n5.  Determine the vertical translation dy and horizontal translation dx based on the top-left marker's position (r1, c1) and other factors:\n    a.  Case 1: If the top-left marker is at (0, 0):\n        i.  Set dx = 1.\n        ii. Check the height of the input grid. If the height is greater than 7, set dy = 0. Otherwise (if height is 7 or less), set dy = 1.\n    b.  Case 2: If the top-left marker is at (1, 1):\n        i.  Check the parity of N_red.\n        ii. If N_red is even, set dy = 2 and dx = 0.\n        iii.If N_red is odd, set dy = 0 and dx = 2.\n    c.  Case 3: If the top-left marker is at any other position (not observed in examples), default to dy=0, dx=0 (no translation).\n6.  For each red pixel located at (r, c) in the input grid, calculate its new position (new_r, new_c) as (r + dy, c + dx).\n7.  Place a red pixel (color 2) at the calculated position (new_r, new_c) in the output grid, ensuring the coordinates are within the grid boundaries. If the new position is outside the grid, the pixel is effectively removed.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_pixels(grid, color):\n  \"\"\"Finds all coordinates of pixels with a specific color.\"\"\"\n  return list(zip(*np.where(grid == color)))\n\ndef count_pixels(grid, color):\n  \"\"\"Counts the number of pixels with a specific color.\"\"\"\n  return np.sum(grid == color)\n\ndef transform(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rules to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get grid dimensions\n    height, width = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Initialize output_grid with background color (white, 0)\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n\n    # Find and copy green pixels (3)\n    green_pixels = find_pixels(input_grid, 3)\n    if not green_pixels:\n        # If no green markers, behavior is undefined by examples.\n        # Returning the input grid might be a safe default, or an empty one.\n        # Based on the problem structure, let's assume markers always exist.\n        # If they don't, we'll copy the grid as is or handle based on future examples.\n        # For now, copy green if they exist.\n         pass # Proceed, but dy/dx calculation might fail if no r1,c1\n\n    for r, c in green_pixels:\n        if 0 <= r < height and 0 <= c < width: # Check bounds just in case\n            output_grid[r, c] = 3\n\n    # Find the top-leftmost green pixel (r1, c1)\n    r1, c1 = -1, -1 # Default if no green pixels\n    if green_pixels:\n        r1, c1 = min(green_pixels, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n\n    # Count red pixels (2)\n    n_red = count_pixels(input_grid, 2)\n\n    # Determine the translation vector (dy, dx) based on revised rules\n    dy, dx = 0, 0 # Default to no translation\n    if r1 == 0 and c1 == 0:\n        dx = 1\n        if height > 7:\n            dy = 0\n        else:\n            dy = 1\n    elif r1 == 1 and c1 == 1:\n        if n_red % 2 == 0: # Even count\n            dy = 2\n            dx = 0\n        else: # Odd count\n            dy = 0\n            dx = 2\n    # else:\n        # If (r1, c1) is something else, or if no green pixels were found (r1,c1 = -1,-1),\n        # dy, dx remain (0, 0), resulting in no translation of the red object.\n\n    # Find all red pixels (2)\n    red_pixels = find_pixels(input_grid, 2)\n\n    # Translate red pixels\n    for r, c in red_pixels:\n        new_r, new_c = r + dy, c + dx\n        # Check if the new coordinates are within the grid bounds\n        if 0 <= new_r < height and 0 <= new_c < width:\n            output_grid[new_r, new_c] = 2\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
