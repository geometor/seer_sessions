"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:

1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify all green pixels (color 3) in the input grid. These act as markers. Copy these green pixels to the output grid at their original locations.
3.  Find the coordinate (r1, c1) of the green pixel with the minimum row index, and then the minimum column index among those (the top-leftmost green marker).
4.  Identify all red pixels (color 2) in the input grid, forming a single connected object. Count the total number of red pixels, N_red.
5.  Determine the vertical translation dy and horizontal translation dx based on the top-left marker's position (r1, c1) and other factors:
    a.  Case 1: If the top-left marker is at (0, 0):
        i.  Set dx = 1.
        ii. Check the height of the input grid. If the height is greater than 7, set dy = 0. Otherwise (if height is 7 or less), set dy = 1.
    b.  Case 2: If the top-left marker is at (1, 1):
        i.  Check the parity of N_red.
        ii. If N_red is even, set dy = 2 and dx = 0.
        iii.If N_red is odd, set dy = 0 and dx = 2.
    c.  Case 3: If the top-left marker is at any other position (not observed in examples), default to dy=0, dx=0 (no translation).
6.  For each red pixel located at (r, c) in the input grid, calculate its new position (new_r, new_c) as (r + dy, c + dx).
7.  Place a red pixel (color 2) at the calculated position (new_r, new_c) in the output grid, ensuring the coordinates are within the grid boundaries. If the new position is outside the grid, the pixel is effectively removed.
