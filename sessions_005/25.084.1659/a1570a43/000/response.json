Find the top-leftmost green pixel at `(r1, c1)`.\n    2.  If `(r1, c1) == (0, 0)`: `dy = 1`, `dx = 1`.\n    3.  If `(r1, c1) == (1, 1)`:\n        *   Count the number of red pixels, `N_red`.\n        *   If `N_red` is even: `dy = 2`, `dx = 1`.\n        *   If `N_red` is odd: `dy = 1`, `dx = 2`.\n    4.  Translate the red shape by `(dy, dx)`.\n\n*   Let's re-check this:\n    *   **train_1:** `(r1, c1) = (1, 1)`. `N_red = 12` (even). Rule gives `dy=2, dx=1`. Shift `(+2, +1)`. **Matches.**\n    *   **train_2:** `(r1, c1) = (1, 1)`. `N_red = 13` (odd). Rule gives `dy=1, dx=2`. Shift `(+1, +2)`. **Matches.**\n    *   **train_3:** `(r1, c1) = (0, 0)`. Rule gives `dy=1, dx=1`. Shift `(+1, +1)`. **Matches.**\n    *   **train_4:** `(r1, c1) = (0, 0)`. Rule gives `dy=1, dx=1`. Shift `(+1, +1)`. **Matches.**\n\n*   This revised hypothesis seems consistent across all examples. The core idea is that the translation vector depends on the position of the top-left green pixel, and *in one specific case* (when the top-left green pixel is at (1,1)), the parity of the red pixel count further modifies the vector.\n\n**Summary of Transformation:**\n1.  Identify all red (2) and green (3) pixels.\n2.  The green pixels remain unchanged in the output grid.\n3.  Find the coordinates `(r1, c1)` of the green pixel with the minimum row index, and among those, the minimum column index (the top-leftmost green pixel).\n4.  Determine the translation vector `(dy, dx)` based on `(r1, c1)`:\n    *   If `(r1, c1)` is `(0, 0)`, then `dy = 1` and `dx = 1`.\n    *   If `(r1, c1)` is `(1, 1)`, then:\n        *   Count the total number of red pixels (`N_red`) in the input grid.\n        *   If `N_red` is even, then `dy = 2` and `dx = 1`.\n        *   If `N_red` is odd, then `dy = 1` and `dx = 2`.\n    *   (Need to consider if other `(r1, c1)` values are possible, but based on examples, these seem to be the only cases).\n5.  Create the output grid, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).\n6.  Copy the green pixels from the input to their same locations in the output grid.\n7.  For every red pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid, place a red pixel at `(r + dy, c + dx)` in the output grid. Ensure the new coordinates are within the grid bounds.\n\nThis looks like a complete and consistent rule.**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Elements:** The grids contain a background of white pixels (0), four green pixels (3), and a shape composed of red pixels (2).\n2.  **Static Elements:** The four green pixels remain in the exact same positions in the output as they were in the input.\n3.  **Dynamic Elements:** The shape formed by the red pixels is translated (moved) to a new position in the output grid. The shape itself is preserved.\n4.  **Green Pixel Configuration:** The green pixels always form a rectangle (or square). In some examples, the top-left green pixel is at `(0, 0)`, while in others, it's at `(1, 1)`.\n5.  **Transformation Driver:** The amount and direction of the red shape's translation `(dy, dx)` seem to depend on the position of the top-leftmost green pixel. Additionally, when the top-left green pixel is at `(1, 1)`, the parity (even or odd) of the total count of red pixels influences the specific translation vector.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
