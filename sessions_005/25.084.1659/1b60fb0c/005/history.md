"""
Identifies specific regions of white pixels (0) based on their relationship to blue pixels (1) and grid boundaries, then changes their color to red (2).

A contiguous region of white pixels is targeted for transformation if it meets either of the following conditions:
a) The white region is entirely surrounded by blue (1) pixels. All adjacent pixels outside the region are blue. Touching the grid boundary means it's not entirely surrounded by blue.
b) The white region is connected to the leftmost column (column 0) AND is NOT connected to the rightmost column (column width-1). Connectivity is defined by adjacency (up, down, left, right) through white pixels only.

All white pixels belonging to a targeted region are changed to red (2).

## General Assessment

The previous code attempted to implement two conditions for filling white regions: (A) enclosed by blue pixels and (B) connected to the left edge but not the right edge. The results show that this logic failed:
*   In examples 1 and 3, it incorrectly filled internal white regions, suggesting Condition A was either misinterpreted or incorrectly applied, or perhaps Condition A is not relevant to this task.
*   In example 2, it failed to fill the correct region, suggesting Condition B was also not correctly identified or applied.
*   Crucially, all *expected* outputs show the filling of a white region connected to the left edge *but not* the right edge. No expected outputs show an internally enclosed region being filled.

This strongly suggests that the core logic should focus *only* on Condition B: identifying white regions connected to the left edge but not the right edge. The "enclosed by blue" condition (A) appears to be a misinterpretation or overcomplication based on the initial example and should likely be disregarded.

The strategy is to refine the natural language program and subsequent code to implement only the "left-connected, not right-connected" rule. We will use BFS to find connected white regions and check their boundary connections.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's verify the boundary connections for the relevant white regions in each example based on the expected output. We define a "region" as a contiguous area of white pixels (0). We check if it touches column 0 (left edge) and the last column (right edge).

**Example 1:**
Input Grid: 10x10
Expected Filled Region: The large white area starting around (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) etc.
Internal White Region: The area around (3,6), (4,6), etc.

**Interpretation of Metrics:**

The code analysis above identifies *all* contiguous white regions and checks their boundary connections. However, the results are surprising and don't align with the visual interpretation or the expected output.

*   **Example 1:** The analysis identifies four white regions. The largest region (starting 0,0) touches *both* left and right, so `should_fill` is False. The internal regions don't touch either edge. This doesn't match the expectation that *some* region should be filled.
*   **Example 2:** Only one large white region is found, touching both left and right. `should_fill` is False. Again, doesn't match expectations.
*   **Example 3:** Similar to Example 1, a large region touching both edges and smaller internal regions are found. None meet the `should_fill` criteria.

**Revised Hypothesis:** The definition of "region" or "connectivity" might be different. Perhaps the blue pixels (1) act as barriers *within* the grid, effectively segmenting the white background? Let's re-examine the visual examples with this idea.

*   **Example 1:** If blue pixels are barriers, then the white area on the left (e.g., columns 1, 2, 3) IS connected to the left edge (col 0) but is BLOCKED by the blue structure from reaching the right edge. The white area inside the blue 'C' shape is separate. The white area on the far right (col 8, 9) is connected to the right edge but blocked from the left.
*   **Example 2:** The white area on the left (cols 1, 2, 3) is connected to the left edge and blocked by blue pixels from reaching the right.
*   **Example 3:** The white area on the left (cols 1, 2, 3) is connected to the left edge and blocked by blue pixels from reaching the right.

This interpretation seems consistent with the expected outputs. The "contiguous white region" must consider blue pixels as impassable barriers during the search (BFS).

**Corrected Metrics Gathering Approach:** Modify the BFS to only traverse white (0) pixels.

**Further Reassessment:**

The metrics results *still* show that no region satisfies the `touches_left and not touches_right` condition when considering connectivity only through white pixels. This contradicts the visual evidence where a region clearly connected to the left *appears* to be filled.

Let's reconsider the fundamental interaction. What if the rule isn't about *connectivity* of the white region itself, but about how the white regions *relate* to the blue shapes?

Could it be like a "paint bucket" fill, starting from the left edge? Imagine flooding white (0) pixels with red (2), starting from any white pixel in column 0. The flood stops when it hits a blue pixel (1) or the grid boundary (excluding the left edge where it started).

Let's trace this "flood fill from left edge" idea:

*   **Example 1:** Start flood from (0,0), (1,0), ..., (9,0). The flood will spread through columns 0, 1, 2, and parts of 3, 4, 5. It will be stopped by the blue pixels (e.g., at (1,3), (2,3)). It will *not* reach the internal white area around (3,6) because that's blocked by blue. It will *not* reach the rightmost white area (cols 8, 9) because that's also blocked by blue. This matches the expected output.
*   **Example 2:** Start flood from left edge. It spreads through columns 0, 1, 2, 3. It's blocked by blue pixels starting in column 4. This matches the expected output.
*   **Example 3:** Start flood from left edge. Spreads through columns 0, 1, 2, 3, parts of 4. Blocked by blue. Matches expected output.

This "flood fill from left edge, blocked by blue" hypothesis seems much more promising and consistent across all examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all white pixels (color 0) located in the leftmost column (column index 0) of the input grid. These are the starting points for the fill.
3.  Perform a flood fill (like a breadth-first search) starting from *all* these starting points simultaneously:
    a. Maintain a queue of pixels to visit, initially populated with the starting points.
    b. Maintain a set or boolean grid to track visited pixels to avoid cycles and redundant processing. Mark the starting pixels as visited and change their color to red (2) in the output grid.
    c. While the queue is not empty:
        i. Dequeue a pixel (row, col).
        ii. Examine its four orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right).
        iii. For each neighbor (nr, nc):
            - If the neighbor is within the grid boundaries,
            - AND the neighbor is a white pixel (color 0 in the *input* grid),
            - AND the neighbor has not been visited yet:
                - Mark the neighbor as visited.
                - Change the neighbor's color to red (2) in the output grid.
                - Enqueue the neighbor (nr, nc).
4.  Return the modified output grid.
