task_description: Fill specific regions of white pixels with red, based on their accessibility from the left edge, considering blue pixels as barriers.

definitions:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
    properties:
      height: number of rows
      width: number of columns
      pixels: cells containing colors (0-9)
  - name: white_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      color_value: 0
      color_name: white
  - name: blue_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      color_value: 1
      color_name: blue
  - name: red_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      color_value: 2
      color_name: red
  - name: barrier
    type: concept
    description: Blue pixels act as impassable barriers for the fill operation.
  - name: fill_source
    type: concept
    description: The fill operation originates from white pixels located on the leftmost column (index 0) of the grid.
  - name: fill_propagation
    type: concept
    description: The fill spreads outwards (up, down, right, left) from the source pixels to adjacent white pixels.
  - name: fill_termination
    type: concept
    description: The fill stops propagating when it encounters a blue pixel or any grid boundary other than the left edge it might have started from.

transformation:
  input: grid (initial state)
  output: grid (final state)
  actions:
    - action: identify_fill_origins
      description: Find all white pixels located in the first column (index 0).
    - action: flood_fill
      description: |
        Starting simultaneously from all identified origin pixels, perform a flood fill operation.
        The fill color is red (2).
        The fill propagates only to adjacent (up, down, left, right) white pixels (0).
        The fill is blocked by blue pixels (1) and grid boundaries.
    - action: finalize_grid
      description: The output grid contains the original pixels, except for the white pixels reached by the flood fill, which are changed to red.
