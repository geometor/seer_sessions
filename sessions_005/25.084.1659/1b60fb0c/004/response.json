            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempted to implement two conditions for filling white regions: (A) enclosed by blue pixels and (B) connected to the left edge but not the right edge. The results show that this logic failed:\n*   In examples 1 and 3, it incorrectly filled internal white regions, suggesting Condition A was either misinterpreted or incorrectly applied, or perhaps Condition A is not relevant to this task.\n*   In example 2, it failed to fill the correct region, suggesting Condition B was also not correctly identified or applied.\n*   Crucially, all *expected* outputs show the filling of a white region connected to the left edge *but not* the right edge. No expected outputs show an internally enclosed region being filled.\n\nThis strongly suggests that the core logic should focus *only* on Condition B: identifying white regions connected to the left edge but not the right edge. The \"enclosed by blue\" condition (A) appears to be a misinterpretation or overcomplication based on the initial example and should likely be disregarded.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the natural language program and subsequent code to implement only the \"left-connected, not right-connected\" rule. We will use BFS to find connected white regions and check their boundary connections.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's verify the boundary connections for the relevant white regions in each example based on the expected output. We define a \"region\" as a contiguous area of white pixels (0). We check if it touches column 0 (left edge) and the last column (right edge).\n\n**Example 1:**\nInput Grid: 10x10\nExpected Filled Region: The large white area starting around (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) etc.\nInternal White Region: The area around (3,6), (4,6), etc.\n"

            "text": "**Interpretation of Metrics:**\n\nThe code analysis above identifies *all* contiguous white regions and checks their boundary connections. However, the results are surprising and don't align with the visual interpretation or the expected output.\n\n*   **Example 1:** The analysis identifies four white regions. The largest region (starting 0,0) touches *both* left and right, so `should_fill` is False. The internal regions don't touch either edge. This doesn't match the expectation that *some* region should be filled.\n*   **Example 2:** Only one large white region is found, touching both left and right. `should_fill` is False. Again, doesn't match expectations.\n*   **Example 3:** Similar to Example 1, a large region touching both edges and smaller internal regions are found. None meet the `should_fill` criteria.\n\n**Revised Hypothesis:** The definition of \"region\" or \"connectivity\" might be different. Perhaps the blue pixels (1) act as barriers *within* the grid, effectively segmenting the white background? Let's re-examine the visual examples with this idea.\n\n*   **Example 1:** If blue pixels are barriers, then the white area on the left (e.g., columns 1, 2, 3) IS connected to the left edge (col 0) but is BLOCKED by the blue structure from reaching the right edge. The white area inside the blue 'C' shape is separate. The white area on the far right (col 8, 9) is connected to the right edge but blocked from the left.\n*   **Example 2:** The white area on the left (cols 1, 2, 3) is connected to the left edge and blocked by blue pixels from reaching the right.\n*   **Example 3:** The white area on the left (cols 1, 2, 3) is connected to the left edge and blocked by blue pixels from reaching the right.\n\nThis interpretation seems consistent with the expected outputs. The \"contiguous white region\" must consider blue pixels as impassable barriers during the search (BFS).\n\n**Corrected Metrics Gathering Approach:** Modify the BFS to only traverse white (0) pixels.\n\n"

This contradicts the visual evidence where a region clearly connected to the left *appears* to be filled.\n\nLet's reconsider the fundamental interaction. What if the rule isn't about *connectivity* of the white region itself, but about how the white regions *relate* to the blue shapes?\n\nCould it be like a \"paint bucket\" fill, starting from the left edge? Imagine flooding white (0) pixels with red (2), starting from any white pixel in column 0. The flood stops when it hits a blue pixel (1) or the grid boundary (excluding the left edge where it started).\n\nLet's trace this \"flood fill from left edge\" idea:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Start flood from (0,0), (1,0), ..., (9,0). The flood will spread through columns 0, 1, 2, and parts of 3, 4, 5. It will be stopped by the blue pixels (e.g., at (1,3), (2,3)). It will *not* reach the internal white area around (3,6) because that's blocked by blue. It will *not* reach the rightmost white area (cols 8, 9) because that's also blocked by blue. This matches the expected output.\n*   **Example 2:** Start flood from left edge. It spreads through columns 0, 1, 2, 3. It's blocked by blue pixels starting in column 4. This matches the expected output.\n*   **Example 3:** Start flood from left edge. Spreads through columns 0, 1, 2, 3, parts of 4. Blocked by blue. Matches expected output.\n\nThis \"flood fill from left edge, blocked by blue\" hypothesis seems much more promising and consistent across all examples.\n\n## YAML Facts Documentation\n\n"
