task_description: "Identify contiguous regions of white pixels enclosed by blue pixels and change their color to red."
elements:
  - element: "grid"
    description: "A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors."
  - element: "pixel"
    description: "A single cell in the grid."
    properties:
      - color: "Represented by integers 0-9. In this task, relevant colors are white (0), blue (1), and red (2)."
      - position: "Coordinates (row, column) within the grid."
  - element: "object"
    description: "A contiguous group of pixels of the same non-white color. In this task, the primary object is the blue shape."
    properties:
      - color: "Blue (1)"
      - shape: "Variable, forms boundaries."
  - element: "region"
    description: "A contiguous group of pixels of the same color."
    properties:
      - color: "White (0) in the input."
      - connectivity: "Pixels are connected horizontally or vertically."
      - relationship_to_boundary: "Can be connected to the grid edge or enclosed by other colors."
actions:
  - action: "identify_enclosed_regions"
    description: "Find all contiguous regions of white (0) pixels that are completely surrounded by blue (1) pixels and do not touch the grid boundary."
    inputs:
      - "input grid"
    outputs:
      - "set of coordinates corresponding to enclosed white pixels"
  - action: "change_color"
    description: "Modify the color of specific pixels."
    inputs:
      - "grid"
      - "set of coordinates"
      - "new color (Red - 2)"
    outputs:
      - "modified grid"
relationships:
  - relationship: "enclosure"
    description: "A region of white pixels is enclosed if any path from a pixel within that region to the grid boundary must cross a blue pixel."
    entities:
      - "white region"
      - "blue object"
      - "grid boundary"
  - relationship: "connectivity"
    description: "Pixels of the same color are connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically."
