The background is white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** The main object in each input grid is a complex shape composed of blue (1) pixels.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation modifies the input grid by changing the color of *some* white (0) pixels to red (2). The original blue (1) pixels remain unchanged.\n4.  **Pattern:** The white pixels that change to red appear to be those located *inside* the enclosed areas formed by the blue shape. White pixels outside the main blue shape or connected to the grid boundary without crossing the blue shape remain white.\n5.  **Enclosure:** The key operation is identifying regions of white pixels that are fully surrounded or enclosed by the blue pixels. These enclosed white regions are then \"filled\" with red.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all white (0) pixels in the input grid that are connected to any of the four boundaries (top, bottom, left, right) through a path consisting only of white (0) pixels. Mark these pixels as \"exterior white\". Connectivity is defined by horizontal and vertical adjacency. (A common way to implement this is using a flood fill algorithm starting from all white boundary pixels).\n3.  Iterate through all pixels in the input grid.\n4.  If a pixel is white (0) and has *not* been marked as \"exterior white\", then it is an \"enclosed white\" pixel.\n5.  Change the color of this \"enclosed white\" pixel in the output grid to red (2).\n6.  Leave all other pixels (blue pixels and \"exterior white\" pixels) in the output grid unchanged from their original input color.\n7.  Return the modified output grid."
