task_description: Identify specific regions of white pixels (0) based on their relationship to blue pixels (1) and grid boundaries, then change their color to red (2).

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Vary (e.g., 10x10 in examples)
  - colors_input: [white (0), blue (1)]
  - colors_output: [white (0), blue (1), red (2)]
  - background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - type: blue_structure
    color: 1
    description: Contiguous block(s) of blue pixels. Their shape and position partition the grid. Remain unchanged in the output.
  - type: white_region
    color: 0
    description: Contiguous blocks of white pixels. Some are transformed to red based on specific rules.
  - type: red_region
    color: 2
    description: Appear in the output grid, replacing specific white regions.

transformation_rules:
  - rule_name: identify_target_white_regions
    description: A contiguous region of white pixels is targeted for transformation if it meets either condition (a) or (b).
    conditions:
      - condition_a:
          name: completely_enclosed
          description: The white region is entirely surrounded by blue (1) pixels. All adjacent pixels outside the region are blue.
      - condition_b:
          name: left_bounded_only
          description: The white region is connected to the leftmost column (column 0) AND is NOT connected to the rightmost column (column width-1). Connectivity is defined by adjacency (including diagonals potentially, but examples only need orthogonal) through white pixels only.
  - rule_name: apply_fill
    description: All white pixels belonging to a targeted region are changed to red (2).
    target_pixels: Pixels identified by 'identify_target_white_regions'.
    new_color: red (2)

observations:
  - Blue structures act as dividers.
  - The grid boundaries, specifically the left and right edges, play a crucial role in defining one type of target region.
  - Purely enclosed white regions (holes within blue structures) are also targets.
  - White regions connected to the right boundary are never filled.
  - White regions connected only to top/bottom/left boundaries (but not right) are filled if connected to left.
  - Connectivity checks (e.g., using BFS/DFS) are needed to determine region properties.
