task_description: Identify and fill specific internal white regions based on connectivity to boundaries.
grid_properties:
  colors: [white (0), blue (1), red (2)]
  size: Variable, examples are 10x10.
objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    properties: Fills most of the grid initially. Can be divided into regions by blue structures.
  - type: structure/barrier
    color: blue (1)
    properties: Forms static shapes, often enclosing or partially enclosing white regions. Acts as a barrier to flood fills.
  - type: fill
    color: red (2)
    properties: Appears in the output grid, replacing some white pixels. Forms contiguous regions.
actions:
  - name: identify_left_reachable_white
    description: Perform a flood fill starting from all white pixels on the left edge (column 0). The fill propagates orthogonally through white pixels only. Mark all reachable white pixels.
  - name: identify_boundary_reachable_white
    description: Perform a flood fill starting from all white pixels on any boundary (top, bottom, left, right). The fill propagates orthogonally through white pixels only. Mark all reachable white pixels.
  - name: determine_fill_target
    description: Identify pixels that were originally white AND are reachable from the left edge BUT NOT reachable from any boundary.
  - name: apply_fill
    description: Change the color of the identified target pixels to red (2).
  - name: copy_unchanged
    description: Leave all other pixels (blue pixels, white pixels reachable from the boundary) unchanged from the input grid.
output_grid: A grid where target white pixels are changed to red, and all other pixels retain their input color.
