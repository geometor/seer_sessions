task_description: Fill white (0) pixels based on the colors of nearby non-white pixels, potentially preserving a white border.

definitions:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - height
      - width
      - pixels: cells with color values
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - row: integer
      - column: integer
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - type: white (0) or non-white (1-9)
  - object: border
    type: set of pixels
    properties:
      - location: top/bottom rows, left/right columns
      - completeness: all pixels in the border locations are white (0)
      - width: single pixel wide

actions:
  - name: identify_border
    input: grid
    output: boolean (has_complete_white_border)
  - name: identify_targets
    input: grid, has_complete_white_border
    output: list of coordinates of white pixels to be filled
    logic: If border exists, target internal white pixels. Else, target all white pixels.
  - name: calculate_fill_color
    input: target_pixel_coordinate, grid
    output: color value (1-9)
    logic:
      - Find all non-white pixels in the input grid.
      - Simulate simultaneous propagation outwards from all non-white pixels using Manhattan distance.
      - A white pixel adopts the color of the first wave(s) to reach it.
      - If multiple colors reach a white pixel in the same wave (same minimum distance), the pixel adopts the color with the lowest numerical index among them.
  - name: fill_pixels
    input: grid, target_coordinates, fill_colors
    output: modified grid
    logic: Create a copy of the input grid. Update the color of each target pixel with its calculated fill color.

examples_summary:
  - example: 1
    input_has_border: false
    targets: all white pixels
    status: Failed - 14 pixels incorrect. Analysis suggests propagation/lowest-index rule works for some mismatches but not all (e.g., (2,0)).
  - example: 2
    input_has_border: true
    targets: internal white pixels only
    status: Failed - 7 pixels incorrect. Analysis suggests propagation/lowest-index rule works for tested mismatches (e.g., (2,4)).
  - example: 3 (Assumed based on previous context)
    status: Passed - The original logic (Green>Freq>Lowest) happened to work for this case.

uncertainties:
  - The exact tie-breaking rule is uncertain, especially concerning pixel Ex1(2,0). The propagation/lowest-index hypothesis seems most promising but needs verification.
  - Are there other factors influencing the fill color besides distance and color index? (e.g., neighbor counts, specific color interactions beyond simple index comparison).
