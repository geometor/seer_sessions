The expected output shows distinct regions defined by the initial colors (green, blue, azure), implying a fill process related to these regions.\n*   **Example 2 Failure:** The transformed output incorrectly filled the outer border of white pixels, which remained white in the expected output. This is a strong indicator that the transformation *only* applies to *enclosed* regions of white pixels, not all white pixels. The interior white pixels were filled, but the transformed output filled them based on proximity to both azure(8) and blue(2), resulting in a different pattern than the expected output, which filled the interior entirely with blue(2).\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Modify the logic to only target white pixels that are \"enclosed\" (not connected to the grid border via other white pixels).\n2.  **Refine Filling Rule:** Re-evaluate the filling logic for these enclosed pixels. The nearest neighbor rule with the existing tie-breaker (green > lowest index) needs to be re-tested against the enclosed pixels only.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"

The expected output has 0 white pixels. The transformation *should* fill all 43 white pixels.\n*   **Example 2:** Input has 70 white pixels total. All 70 are connected to the border (meaning none are truly enclosed in the sense of being surrounded by non-white pixels without a path to the edge). The expected output retains 36 white pixels (the border).\n\nThis contradicts the \"enclosed\" hypothesis derived visually from Example 2. The code correctly identified that *no* white pixels are enclosed in Example 2's input.\n\n**Revised Hypothesis 2:**\n\nMaybe the rule isn't about strict enclosure but about filling *until* a boundary is met? Or perhaps it relates to Voronoi regions defined by the initial non-white pixels?\n\nLet's re-examine Example 2 Expected Output:\n"

This looks like successive layers expanding *inward* from the initial non-white pixels, but stopping at the grid edge.\n\nLet's reconsider the original rule with a slight modification: Apply the fill rule *only* to white pixels that have at least one non-white neighbor (adjacency includes diagonals). This prevents filling completely isolated white areas or extending indefinitely. *Wait*, that doesn't explain why the border remains in Example 2.\n\n**Revised Hypothesis 3:**\n\n1.  The transformation fills *some* white (0) pixels based on proximity to non-white pixels.\n2.  Crucially, white pixels that are part of the *outermost border* of the grid *and* remain connected to other border white pixels *might* be exempt from filling.\n3.  For white pixels that *are* subject to filling:\n    *   Find the non-white pixel(s) with the minimum Manhattan distance.\n    *   Tie-breaking:\n        *   If green (3) is among the tied colors, use green (3).\n        *   Otherwise, use the color with the lowest numerical index among the tied colors.\n\nLet's test Hypothesis 3:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   White pixels at the border exist, e.g., (0,1), (1,0), (0,3), (0,4), (0,8), (1,9) etc.\n    *   Expected output has *no* white pixels. This contradicts the idea that border white pixels are always exempt. Maybe they are only exempt if they form a complete, connected border? In Example 1, the green (3) pixels interrupt the white border.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   The input has a complete border of white pixels.\n    *   The expected output *keeps* this complete border of white pixels.\n    *   The white pixels *inside* this border *are* filled.\n    *   Let's check the fill logic again for an internal pixel, e.g., (3, 4). Input: Nearest non-white are (3,3)[blue=2] dist=1 and (4,4)[blue=2] dist=1. Tie-break: lowest index is blue(2). Expected is blue(2). Matches.\n    *   Check (2, 3). Input: Nearest non-white are (2,2)[blue=2] dist=1, (3,3)[blue=2] dist=1, (1,2)[azure=8] dist=2, (1,4)[azure=8] dist=2. Min dist=1. Tied colors = blue(2). Fill blue(2). Expected is blue(2). Matches.\n    *   Check (2, 8). Input: Nearest non-white are (1,8)[azure=8] dist=1, (2,7)[blue=2] dist=1, (3,8)[azure=8] dist=1. Min dist=1. Tied colors = blue(2), azure(8). Green not present. Lowest index is blue(2). Fill blue(2). Expected is *azure*(8). Mismatch!\n\n**Revised Hypothesis 4 (Refining Tie-Break):**\n\nThe tie-breaking rule seems more complex or different. In Example 2, pixel (2,8) is equidistant from blue(2) and azure(8), but becomes azure(8). Pixel (3,4) is equidistant from two blue(2) pixels and becomes blue(2). Pixel (2,3) is equidistant from two blue(2) pixels and becomes blue(2).\n\nWhat if the tie-break considers the *source* pixels?\n*   For (2,8), tied sources: (1,8)[azure=8], (2,7)[blue=2], (3,8)[azure=8]. Colors {2, 8}. Output is 8.\n*   For (3,4), tied sources: (3,3)[blue=2], (4,4)[blue=2]. Colors {2}. Output is 2.\n*   For (2,3), tied sources: (2,2)[blue=2], (3,3)[blue=2]. Colors {2}. Output is 2.\n\nConsider Example 1, pixel (0,1). Nearest: (0,0)[green=3], (1,1)[blue=2]. Colors {3, 2}. Expected output is green(3).\nConsider Example 1, pixel (2,3). Nearest: (1,3)[blue=2], (3,3)[azure=8]. Colors {2, 8}. Expected output is blue(2).\n\nNew Tie-breaking rule proposal:\n1. Find all non-white pixels at minimum Manhattan distance.\n2. Collect their colors.\n3. If green (3) is present, the result is green (3).\n4. If green (3) is not present, *and* all tied colors are the same, use that color.\n5. If green (3) is not present, *and* there are *different* tied colors, use the color with the lowest numerical index (e.g., blue(2) wins over azure(8)).\n\nLet's re-test with this tie-break rule:\n*   Ex 1 (0,1): Tied colors {3, 2}. Green present. Result: 3. (Matches expected)\n*   Ex 1 (2,3): Tied colors {2, 8}. Green not present. Different colors. Lowest index is 2. Result: 2. (Matches expected)\n*   Ex 2 (3,4): Tied colors {2}. Green not present. Same color. Result: 2. (Matches expected)\n*   Ex 2 (2,3): Tied colors {2}. Green not present. Same color. Result: 2. (Matches expected)\n*   Ex 2 (2,8): Tied colors {2, 8}. Green not present. Different colors. Lowest index is 2. Result: 2. (Expected is 8 - STILL MISMATCHES!)\n\n**Revised Hypothesis 5 (Back to Basics):**\n\nWhat if it's simpler? What if the \"border rule\" applies first?\n1. Identify if the input grid has a solid, connected border of white pixels (0) surrounding all other pixels.\n2. If YES (like Example 2): Keep this border white. Fill the *interior* white pixels using some rule.\n3. If NO (like Example 1): Fill *all* white pixels using some rule.\n\nNow, what is the filling rule? Let's focus on the pixels that *do* get filled.\n\n*   **Example 1 (All white pixels fill):**\n    *   (0,1) -> 3 (Nearest 3, 2 -> Tie -> Green wins)\n    *   (2,3) -> 2 (Nearest 2, 8 -> Tie -> No Green -> Lowest index wins)\n    *   (2,4) -> 8 (Nearest 8, 8 -> No tie -> 8)\n*   **Example 2 (Interior white pixels fill):**\n    *   (3,4) -> 2 (Nearest 2, 2 -> No tie -> 2)\n    *   (2,3) -> 2 (Nearest 2, 2 -> No tie -> 2)\n    *   (2,8) -> 8 (Nearest 8, 2, 8 -> Tie -> ??? -> Expected is 8)\n\nThe tie-breaking is still the problem. Let's look at (2,8) in Example 2 again. Nearest pixels: (1,8)[azure=8], (2,7)[blue=2], (3,8)[azure=8]. Dist=1.\nMaybe the tie-break involves counting? There are two azure(8) and one blue(2) at distance 1. Does the color with the highest count win?\n*   Ex 2 (2,8): Tied {8, 2, 8}. Counts: {8: 2, 2: 1}. Max count is for 8. Result: 8. (Matches expected!)\n*   Ex 1 (0,1): Tied {3, 2}. Counts: {3: 1, 2: 1}. Counts are tied. What now? Maybe fall back to lowest index? Result: 2. (Expected is 3! - Fails). But wait, we had the green rule.\n\n**Revised Tie-Breaking Rule Proposal 2:**\n\n1.  Find all non-white pixels at minimum Manhattan distance.\n2.  Collect their colors.\n3.  If green (3) is present among the tied colors, the result is green (3).\n4.  If green (3) is *not* present:\n    *   Count the occurrences of each color among the tied pixels.\n    *   If one color has a strictly higher count than all others, use that color.\n    *   If counts are tied (or if there was only one nearest pixel initially), use the color with the lowest numerical index among those involved in the tie.\n\nLet's test this complex tie-break:\n*   Ex 1 (0,1): Tied {3, 2}. Green present. Result: 3. (Matches expected)\n*   Ex 1 (2,3): Tied {2, 8}. No green. Counts {2:1, 8:1}. Counts tied. Lowest index is 2. Result: 2. (Matches expected)\n*   Ex 2 (3,4): Tied {2, 2}. No green. Counts {2:2}. Max count is 2. Result: 2. (Matches expected)\n*   Ex 2 (2,3): Tied {2, 2}. No green. Counts {2:2}. Max count is 2. Result: 2.

(Matches expected)\n\nThis looks much more promising!\n\n**Final Combined Hypothesis:**\n\n1.  **Check Border:** Determine if the input grid has a complete, connected, single-pixel-wide border consisting only of white (0) pixels.\n2.  **Identify Target White Pixels:**\n    *   If a complete white border exists: Target only the white pixels *not* part of this border.\n    *   If no complete white border exists: Target *all* white pixels.\n3.  **Fill Target Pixels:** For each target white pixel:\n    *   Find all non-white pixels in the *original input grid*.\n    *   Calculate the Manhattan distance from the target white pixel to each non-white pixel.\n    *   Identify the minimum distance.\n    *   Collect all non-white pixels (location and color) at this minimum distance.\n    *   Apply the tie-breaking rule to the colors of these nearest pixels:\n        *   If green (3) is among the tied colors, the fill color is green (3).\n        *   Otherwise, count the occurrences of each tied color. If one color has a strictly higher count, use that color.\n        *   Otherwise (counts are tied, or only one nearest pixel), use the color with the lowest numerical index among the tied colors.\n    *   Set the target white pixel's color in the output grid to the determined fill color.\n4.  **Copy Others:** Non-target white pixels and all original non-white pixels retain their color in the output grid.\n\n\n**YAML Facts**\n"

Check if the input grid possesses a complete, connected, single-pixel-wide border composed entirely of white (0) pixels. This involves checking all pixels at row 0, the last row, column 0, and the last column.\n3.  Identify the set of white pixels to be filled ('target pixels'):\n    *   If the complete white border exists, the target pixels are all white pixels *not* located on this border.\n    *   If the complete white border does *not* exist, the target pixels are *all* white pixels in the grid.\n4.  Create a list of all non-white pixels from the original input grid, storing their coordinates and colors.\n5.  For each target pixel coordinate `(r, c)`:\n    a. Calculate the Manhattan distance `d = |r - nr| + |c - nc|` to every non-white pixel `(nr, nc)` found in step 4.\n    b. Find the minimum distance calculated.\n    c. Identify all non-white pixels that are exactly at this minimum distance. Collect their colors into a list (`tied_colors`).\n    d. Determine the final fill color using the following tie-breaking rules applied to `tied_colors`:\n        i.  If the color green (3) is present in `tied_colors`, the fill color is green (3).\n        ii. If green (3) is not present, count the frequency of each color in `tied_colors`. If one color appears more often than any other color, that color is the fill color.\n        iii. If green (3) is not present and there is a tie in frequency counts (or if there was only one nearest pixel to begin with), the fill color is the one with the smallest numerical index among the tied colors.\n    e. Update the output grid at coordinate `(r, c)` with this determined fill color.\n6.  Return the modified output grid. (Pixels not targeted in step 3 retain their original color from the input)."
