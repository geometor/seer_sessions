Identify all unique colors present in the input grid, excluding white (0) and gray (5).
Count the total number of pixels for each of these colors.
Find the minimum pixel count among these colors.
Identify the set of colors that have this minimum count.
If there is more than one color with the minimum count, select the one with the highest color index.
Create an output grid by copying the input grid.
Replace all pixels in the output grid corresponding to the selected color with gray (5).
