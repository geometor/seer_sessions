Context:
  - Input and output grids are the same size (10x10).
  - Grids contain a white (0) background and multiple colored objects.
  - Gray (5) often exists as an object color in the input.

Input Elements:
  - Objects: Contiguous regions of pixels with the same color (excluding white=0).
  - Properties:
    - Color: Integer value 1-9.
    - Pixel Count: Total number of pixels for each color.

Transformation:
  - Action: Color Replacement.
  - Target Color: Pixels of one specific input color are changed.
  - Replacement Color: The target color pixels are replaced with gray (5).
  - Selection Rule: The color to be replaced is determined by:
    1. Identifying all colors present in the input, excluding white (0) and gray (5).
    2. Calculating the total pixel count for each of these identified colors.
    3. Finding the minimum pixel count among them.
    4. Identifying the set of candidate colors that have this minimum pixel count.
    5. Applying a tie-breaking rule if there is more than one candidate color.
  - Tie-breaking Observation:
    - Rule "select highest color index" works for train_1, train_2 but not train_3.
    - Rule "select lowest color index" works for train_3 but not train_1, train_2.
    - The simple index-based tie-breaking observed is inconsistent across examples.

Output Elements:
  - The output grid is identical to the input grid, except all pixels of the selected color have been changed to gray (5).
