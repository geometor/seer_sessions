            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids are 10x10 and contain a white (0) background with several distinct objects (contiguous blocks of single colors).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are also 10x10 and are nearly identical to the input grids.\n3.  **Transformation:** In each example, precisely one color (other than white or gray) present in the input grid is entirely replaced by the color gray (5) in the output grid. All other pixels remain unchanged.\n4.  **Color Analysis:**\n    *   The background color is always white (0).\n    *   The replacement color is always gray (5).\n    *   Gray (5) objects may also exist in the input, but they are never the ones targeted for replacement.\n    *   The specific color that gets replaced varies between examples: maroon (9) in `train_1`, magenta (6) in `train_2`, and blue (1) in `train_3`.\n5.  **Selection Criterion:** The key is determining *which* color gets replaced. Comparing the pixel counts of all colors (excluding white=0 and gray=5):\n    *   `train_1`: Colors 3, 4, 7, 9 all have the minimum count (3 pixels). Color 9 is chosen.\n    *   `train_2`: Colors 1 and 6 have the minimum count (4 pixels). Color 6 is chosen.\n    *   `train_3`: Colors 1, 3, 4, 6 all have the minimum count (4 pixels). Color 1 is chosen.\n6.  **Tie-breaking:** When multiple colors share the minimum pixel count, a tie-breaking rule is needed.\n    *   Trying \"select the color with the highest index\" works for `train_1` (9 is highest in {3,4,7,9}) and `train_2` (6 is highest in {1,6}) but fails for `train_3` (6 is highest in {1,3,4,6}, but 1 was chosen).\n    *   Trying \"select the color with the lowest index\" works for `train_3` (1 is lowest in {1,3,4,6}) but fails for `train_1` (3 is lowest in {3,4,7,9}, but 9 was chosen) and `train_2` (1 is lowest in {1,6}, but 6 was chosen).\n    *   The tie-breaking rule based purely on color index is inconsistent across the examples. However, selecting the color with the *highest index* among those with the minimum count works for the first two examples. Given the limited data, this might be the intended rule, possibly with an anomaly in `train_3` or a more complex rule not yet identified.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
