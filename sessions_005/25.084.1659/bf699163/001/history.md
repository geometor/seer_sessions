    - Example 2: 13 orange pixels. Output pattern color is Blue (1).
- Is there a mapping from the count of orange pixels to the target color?
    - 19 -> 4 (Yellow)
    - 13 -> 1 (Blue)
- This doesn't seem direct or obvious. What about modulo arithmetic?
    - 19 mod 9 = 1 (Colors 1-9). Doesn't give 4.
    - 13 mod 9 = 4. Doesn't give 1.
    - 19 mod 10 = 9.
    - 13 mod 10 = 3.
- What if the orange pixels *point* in some direction? Most orange pixels in Ex1 are in cols 1 and 7. The yellow pattern is in col 3. In Ex2, most orange pixels are in col 8. The blue pattern is in col 10.
- Directionality doesn't seem clear.
- Let's reconsider the structure `[[C,C,C],[C,5,C],[C,C,C]]`.
- What if we look at the non-gray colors present *besides* the ones forming these patterns and the orange markers?
    - Example 1: Colors 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 are present. The patterns use 1, 2, 3, 4, 8. Orange (7) is the marker. Are there any other colors? No. Gray (5) is the background and center. White (0) is not used. Magenta (6), Maroon (9) are not used.
    - Example 2: Colors 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 are present. The patterns use 1, 2, 3, 6, 8. Orange (7) is the marker. Are there any other colors? No. Gray (5) is background/center. White (0), Yellow (4), Magenta(6->pattern), Maroon (9) are not used. Wait, Magenta(6) is used in a pattern.
- Okay, let's list the colors used for the `[[C,C,C],[C,5,C],[C,C,C]]` patterns in each example:
    - Ex 1: {1, 2, 3, 4, 8} (Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, Azure)
    - Ex 2: {1, 2, 3, 6, 8} (Blue, Red, Green, Magenta, Azure)
- The output color is Yellow (4) in Ex 1, and Blue (1) in Ex 2.
- Is the chosen color the *minimum* color index present in the set of pattern colors?
    - Ex 1: min({1, 2, 3, 4, 8}) = 1 (Blue). Output is Yellow (4). No.
    - Ex 2: min({1, 2, 3, 6, 8}) = 1 (Blue). Output is Blue (1). Yes.
- Is the chosen color the *maximum* color index present?
    - Ex 1: max({1, 2, 3, 4, 8}) = 8 (Azure). Output is Yellow (4). No.
    - Ex 2: max({1, 2, 3, 6, 8}) = 8 (Azure). Output is Blue (1). No.
- What else could determine the choice?
- Look at the *location* (top-left corner) of each pattern:
    - Ex 1:
        - Blue(1) at (1, 2)
        - Green(3) at (4, 7)
        - Red(2) at (6, 14)
        - Yellow(4) at (9, 3) -> Output
        - Azure(8) at (14, 11)
    - Ex 2:
        - Azure(8) at (1, 1)
        - Red(2) at (2, 11)
        - Green(3) at (6, 4)
        - Blue(1) at (10, 10) -> Output
        - Magenta(6) at (13, 1)
- Is the chosen pattern the lowest one?
    - Ex 1: Lowest pattern (max row index) is Azure(8) at row 14. Output is Yellow(4) at row 9. No.
    - Ex 2: Lowest pattern is Magenta(6) at row 13. Output is Blue(1) at row 10. No.
- Is the chosen pattern the highest one?
    - Ex 1: Highest pattern (min row index) is Blue(1) at row 1. Output is Yellow(4) at row 9. No.
    - Ex 2: Highest pattern is Azure(8) at row 1. Output is Blue(1) at row 10. No.
- Leftmost? Rightmost?
    - Ex 1: Leftmost is Blue(1) at col 2. Output Yellow(4) is at col 3. No. Rightmost is Red(2) at col 14. No.
    - Ex 2: Leftmost is Azure(8) or Magenta(6) at col 1. Output Blue(1) is at col 10. No. Rightmost is Red(2) at col 11. No.
- How about the pattern closest to the center of the grid?
    - Ex 1: Grid is 17x18. Center is roughly (8, 8.5).
        - Blue(1) at (1, 2): Dist ~ sqrt((8-1)^2 + (8.5-2)^2) = sqrt(49 + 42.25) = sqrt(91.25) ~ 9.5
        - Green(3) at (4, 7): Dist ~ sqrt((8-4)^2 + (8.5-7)^2) = sqrt(16 + 2.25) = sqrt(18.25) ~ 4.3
        - Red(2) at (6, 14): Dist ~ sqrt((8-6)^2 + (8.5-14)^2) = sqrt(4 + 30.25) = sqrt(34.25) ~ 5.8
        - Yellow(4) at (9, 3): Dist ~ sqrt((8-9)^2 + (8.5-3)^2) = sqrt(1 + 30.25) = sqrt(31.25) ~ 5.6 -> Output
        - Azure(8) at (14, 11): Dist ~ sqrt((8-14)^2 + (8.5-11)^2) = sqrt(36 + 6.25) = sqrt(42.25) ~ 6.5
        - Green(3) is closest to center. Output is Yellow(4). No.
    - Ex 2: Grid is 17x16. Center is roughly (8, 7.5).
        - Azure(8) at (1, 1): Dist ~ sqrt((8-1)^2 + (7.5-1)^2) = sqrt(49 + 42.25) = sqrt(91.25) ~ 9.5
        - Red(2) at (2, 11): Dist ~ sqrt((8-2)^2 + (7.5-11)^2) = sqrt(36 + 12.25) = sqrt(48.25) ~ 6.9
        - Green(3) at (6, 4): Dist ~ sqrt((8-6)^2 + (7.5-4)^2) = sqrt(4 + 12.25) = sqrt(16.25) ~ 4.0
        - Blue(1) at (10, 10): Dist ~ sqrt((8-10)^2 + (7.5-10)^2) = sqrt(4 + 6.25) = sqrt(10.25) ~ 3.2 -> Output
        - Magenta(6) at (13, 1): Dist ~ sqrt((8-13)^2 + (7.5-1)^2) = sqrt(25 + 42.25) = sqrt(67.25) ~ 8.2
        - Blue(1) is closest to center. Yes.
- This "closest to center" rule works for Example 2 but not Example 1.

- Let's reconsider the orange pixels (color 7).
- Maybe the orange pixels define a bounding box, and the target pattern is inside?
    - Ex 1: Orange pixels range from row 7 to 16, col 1 to 8.
        - Min row: 7, Max row: 16
        - Min col: 1, Max col: 8
        - BBox: (7, 1) to (16, 8)
        - Patterns inside: Green(3) at (4, 7) - NO, outside box. Yellow(4) at (9, 3) - YES.
        - Is Yellow(4) the *only* pattern inside this orange BBox? Blue(1) outside. Red(2) outside. Azure(8) outside. Green(3) outside. Yes!
    - Ex 2: Orange pixels range from row 8 to 16, col 8 to 15.
        - Min row: 8, Max row: 16
        - Min col: 8, Max col: 15
        - BBox: (8, 8) to (16, 15)
        - Patterns inside: Blue(1) at (10, 10) - YES.
        - Is Blue(1) the only pattern inside this orange BBox? Azure(8) outside. Red(2) outside. Green(3) outside. Magenta(6) outside. Yes!

- Hypothesis 3:
    1. Find all orange (7) pixels in the input grid.
    2. Determine the bounding box enclosing all orange pixels (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
    3. Search the input grid for all instances of 3x3 patterns of the form `[[C,C,C],[C,5,C],[C,C,C]]` where C is any non-gray color.
    4. Identify the unique pattern whose top-left corner falls *strictly inside* the bounding box defined by the orange pixels (i.e., `min_row < pattern_row < max_row` and `min_col < pattern_col < max_col`). Note: Using strict inequality based on Ex1 where Green(3) at (4,7) is outside the box starting at row 7 / col 1. Wait, the pattern's *area* needs to be considered.
    5. Let's redefine step 4: Identify the unique pattern whose 3x3 area is entirely contained within the bounding box defined by the orange pixels. The pattern is located at `(r, c)` to `(r+2, c+2)`. We need `min_row <= r` and `r+2 <= max_row` and `min_col <= c` and `c+2 <= max_col`.
    6. Test refined step 4 with Ex 1: Orange BBox [7:16, 1:8] (inclusive rows/cols).
        - Blue(1) at (1, 2): No.
        - Green(3) at (4, 7): No (starts before row 7).
        - Red(2) at (6, 14): No (ends after col 8).
        - Yellow(4) at (9, 3): r=9, c=3. 7<=9<=16, 1<=3<=8. r+2=11, c+2=5. 11<=16, 5<=8. Yes.
        - Azure(8) at (14, 11): No (ends after col 8).
        - Yellow(4) is the unique match.
    7. Test refined step 4 with Ex 2: Orange BBox [8:16, 8:15] (inclusive rows/cols).
        - Azure(8) at (1, 1): No.
        - Red(2) at (2, 11): No (starts before row 8).
        - Green(3) at (6, 4): No.
        - Blue(1) at (10, 10): r=10, c=10. 8<=10<=16, 8<=10<=15. r+2=12, c+2=12. 12<=16, 12<=15. Yes.
        - Magenta(6) at (13, 1): No.
        - Blue(1) is the unique match.
    8. Output the identified 3x3 pattern.

- This hypothesis seems robust and works for both examples. The orange pixels act as markers defining a region of interest, and the target is the specific pattern type located within that region.

**Summary of Perception:**
- The input grid contains multiple instances of a specific 3x3 pattern template: a non-gray color C forming a square border around a gray center `[[C,C,C],[C,5,C],[C,C,C]]`. Let's call this the "target pattern".
- Different colors (Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, Azure, Magenta) are used for C in these patterns across the grid.
- The input grid also contains orange (7) pixels, which may not form a regular shape but are scattered.
- The task is to identify *one* specific instance of the target pattern and output it.
- The selection mechanism involves the orange pixels. They define a bounding box.
- The unique target pattern instance whose 3x3 area lies completely within the bounding box of the orange pixels is the desired output.

**Natural Language Program:**
1. Find all pixels with the color orange (7) in the input grid.
2. Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by these orange pixels. This defines the orange bounding box.
3. Iterate through all possible 3x3 subgrids in the input grid.
4. For each 3x3 subgrid, check if it matches the "target pattern" structure: `[[C,C,C],[C,5,C],[C,C,C]]`, where C is any color other than gray (5) and white (0 - though 0 isn't used here), and the center pixel is gray (5).
5. If a 3x3 subgrid matches the target pattern structure, check if its location (top-left corner at row `r`, column `c`) is fully contained within the orange bounding box found in step 2. That is, check if `min_orange_row <= r` AND `r + 2 <= max_orange_row` AND `min_orange_col <= c` AND `c + 2 <= max_orange_col`.
6. There will be exactly one such matching 3x3 subgrid that satisfies both the pattern structure and the location constraint.
7. Output this unique 3x3 subgrid.Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The inputs are large grids (17x18 and 17x16) containing various patterns, while the outputs are small 3x3 grids.
2.  **Background Color:** Gray (5) appears to be the predominant background color and also serves a specific role within certain patterns.
3.  **Key Pattern:** A recurring motif is a 3x3 pattern consisting of a non-gray color (let's call it 'C') forming a border around a central gray (5) pixel:
    
```
    C C C
    C 5 C
    C C C
    ```

    I'll refer to this as the "hollow square" pattern.
4.  **Multiple Hollow Squares:** Each input grid contains multiple instances of this hollow square pattern, each using a different color 'C'.
    *   Example 1 uses Blue(1), Green(3), Red(2), Yellow(4), and Azure(8) for 'C'.
    *   Example 2 uses Azure(8), Red(2), Green(3), Blue(1), and Magenta(6) for 'C'.
5.  **Selector Element:** Orange (7) pixels are present in both input grids. They don't form the hollow square pattern themselves but appear in various locations, sometimes clustered, sometimes scattered. Their arrangement differs significantly between the two examples.
6.  **Transformation Goal:** The task is to select exactly one of the hollow square patterns from the input grid and output it.
7.  **Selection Mechanism:** The orange (7) pixels seem crucial for determining *which* hollow square pattern to select. By finding the minimum and maximum row and column indices of all orange pixels, we define a bounding box. The specific hollow square pattern whose 3x3 area lies entirely *within* this bounding box is the one selected for the output. In both examples, only one hollow square pattern satisfies this condition.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid to locate all pixels with the color orange (7).
2.  Determine the minimum row index (`min_r`), maximum row index (`max_r`), minimum column index (`min_c`), and maximum column index (`max_c`) among all found orange pixels. These define the corners of the orange bounding box.
3.  Search the input grid for all 3x3 subgrids starting at position (`r`, `c`).
4.  For each 3x3 subgrid, check if it matches the "hollow square" pattern: the border pixels must all be the same non-gray color (`C`), and the center pixel must be gray (5).
5.  If a subgrid at (`r`, `c`) matches the pattern, verify if its entire 3x3 area is contained within the orange bounding box calculated in step 2. The condition for containment is: `min_r <= r` AND `r + 2 <= max_r` AND `min_c <= c` AND `c + 2 <= max_c`.
6.  Identify the single 3x3 subgrid that satisfies both the pattern match (step 4) and the containment check (step 5).
7.  Return this identified 3x3 subgrid as the output.
