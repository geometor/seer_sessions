Examining the examples suggests these rectangular blocks must have both a width and a height of at least 2 pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Iterate through the input grid to find all *maximal* contiguous rectangular regions composed entirely of white (0) pixels. A maximal region is one that cannot be expanded in any direction (up, down, left, right) without including a non-white pixel or going beyond the grid boundaries.\n3.  For each identified maximal white rectangular region:\n    a.  Determine its height and width.\n    b.  Check if the height is greater than or equal to 2 AND the width is greater than or equal to 2.\n    c.  If both conditions (height >= 2 and width >= 2) are true, then for every pixel within that rectangular region in the *output* grid, change its color from white (0) to blue (1).\n4.  Ensure all pixels that were originally gray (5) in the input remain gray (5) in the output, and any white (0) pixels that were not part of a qualifying rectangle (from step 3c) remain white (0) in the output. (This step is implicitly handled by starting with a copy and only modifying specific regions).\n5.  The final modified grid is the result."
