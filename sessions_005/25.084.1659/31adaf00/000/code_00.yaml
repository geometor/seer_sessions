task_description: Replace rectangular regions of white pixels with blue pixels if the region meets size criteria.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - colors_used_input: [white (0), gray (5)]
  - colors_used_output: [white (0), gray (5), blue (1)]
objects:
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Can be white (0), gray (5), or blue (1).
      - position: Defined by row and column index.
  - object: rectangular_region
    properties:
      - color: Consists entirely of pixels of the same color (initially white (0)).
      - shape: Rectangular (defined by top-left corner, height, width).
      - contiguity: Pixels within the region are adjacent.
      - minimality: The region is maximal (cannot be extended further while maintaining uniform color).
relationships:
  - relationship: Persistence
    description: Gray (5) pixels maintain their color and position from input to output.
  - relationship: Transformation
    description: Specific rectangular regions of white (0) pixels in the input are transformed into blue (1) pixels in the output.
    conditions:
      - The rectangular region must consist entirely of white (0) pixels.
      - The height of the region must be >= 2.
      - The width of the region must be >= 2.
actions:
  - action: Identify
    target: Maximal contiguous rectangular regions of white (0) pixels in the input grid.
  - action: Filter
    target: Identified rectangular regions.
    criteria: Height >= 2 AND Width >= 2.
  - action: Replace_Color
    target: Pixels within the filtered rectangular regions.
    from_color: white (0)
    to_color: blue (1)
  - action: Preserve
    target: All gray (5) pixels and any white (0) pixels not part of a replaced region.
    description: Keep their original color and position in the output grid.
