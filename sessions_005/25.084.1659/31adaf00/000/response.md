Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both 2D grids of the same dimensions (10x10 in the examples).
2.  **Colors:** The grids use three colors: white (0), gray (5), and blue (1).
3.  **Input Composition:** The input grids consist only of white (0) and gray (5) pixels.
4.  **Output Composition:** The output grids consist of white (0), gray (5), and blue (1) pixels.
5.  **Key Change:** The transformation involves changing some white (0) pixels in the input to blue (1) pixels in the output.
6.  **Static Elements:** The gray (5) pixels appear to remain unchanged in both position and color between the input and output grids.
7.  **Pattern of Change:** The blue pixels in the output appear in rectangular blocks, replacing areas that were entirely white in the input. Examining the examples suggests these rectangular blocks must have both a width and a height of at least 2 pixels.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Replace rectangular regions of white pixels with blue pixels if the region meets size criteria.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - colors_used_input: [white (0), gray (5)]
  - colors_used_output: [white (0), gray (5), blue (1)]
objects:
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Can be white (0), gray (5), or blue (1).
      - position: Defined by row and column index.
  - object: rectangular_region
    properties:
      - color: Consists entirely of pixels of the same color (initially white (0)).
      - shape: Rectangular (defined by top-left corner, height, width).
      - contiguity: Pixels within the region are adjacent.
      - minimality: The region is maximal (cannot be extended further while maintaining uniform color).
relationships:
  - relationship: Persistence
    description: Gray (5) pixels maintain their color and position from input to output.
  - relationship: Transformation
    description: Specific rectangular regions of white (0) pixels in the input are transformed into blue (1) pixels in the output.
    conditions:
      - The rectangular region must consist entirely of white (0) pixels.
      - The height of the region must be >= 2.
      - The width of the region must be >= 2.
actions:
  - action: Identify
    target: Maximal contiguous rectangular regions of white (0) pixels in the input grid.
  - action: Filter
    target: Identified rectangular regions.
    criteria: Height >= 2 AND Width >= 2.
  - action: Replace_Color
    target: Pixels within the filtered rectangular regions.
    from_color: white (0)
    to_color: blue (1)
  - action: Preserve
    target: All gray (5) pixels and any white (0) pixels not part of a replaced region.
    description: Keep their original color and position in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid to find all *maximal* contiguous rectangular regions composed entirely of white (0) pixels. A maximal region is one that cannot be expanded in any direction (up, down, left, right) without including a non-white pixel or going beyond the grid boundaries.
3.  For each identified maximal white rectangular region:
    a.  Determine its height and width.
    b.  Check if the height is greater than or equal to 2 AND the width is greater than or equal to 2.
    c.  If both conditions (height >= 2 and width >= 2) are true, then for every pixel within that rectangular region in the *output* grid, change its color from white (0) to blue (1).
4.  Ensure all pixels that were originally gray (5) in the input remain gray (5) in the output, and any white (0) pixels that were not part of a qualifying rectangle (from step 3c) remain white (0) in the output. (This step is implicitly handled by starting with a copy and only modifying specific regions).
5.  The final modified grid is the result.
