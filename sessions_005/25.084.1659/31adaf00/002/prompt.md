"""
Identifies all maximal contiguous rectangular regions composed entirely of white (0) pixels in the input grid.
For each such region found, if its height is 2 or more AND its width is 2 or more, 
all the pixels within that region are changed to blue (1) in the output grid.
All other pixels, including gray (5) pixels and white (0) pixels belonging to regions 
that do not meet the size criteria (height < 2 or width < 2), remain unchanged.
