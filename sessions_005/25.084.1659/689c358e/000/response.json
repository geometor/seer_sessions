Specific border pixels change color based on the internal objects.\n    *   For each internal object, its color is \"projected\" onto one cell of the border. The border chosen (top, bottom, left, or right) is the one closest to the object's center.\n    *   The specific cell on the chosen border that receives the object's color corresponds to the row or column where the object has the most pixels.\n    *   Simultaneously, the border cell directly opposite the projected color is changed to white (0).\n\n*   **Facts YAML**:\n    "
