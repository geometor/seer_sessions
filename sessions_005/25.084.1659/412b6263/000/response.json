            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Sizes**: The input and output grids have different dimensions in all examples. The output grid is significantly larger than the input grid.\n    *   Example 1: Input 9x6 -> Output 15x11\n    *   Example 2: Input 7x8 -> Output 19x9\n    *   Example 3: Input 5x5 -> Output 13x7\n2.  **Core Transformation**: Observing the relationship between input and output contents, it appears the input grid undergoes a transformation involving transposition (swapping rows and columns) and vertical flipping. Let's call the result of this transformation the `core_grid`.\n    *   Example 1: Input (9x6) -> Transposed (6x9) -> Flipped Vertically (6x9) = `core_grid`.\n    *   Example 2: Input (7x8) -> Transposed (8x7) -> Flipped Vertically (8x7) = `core_grid`.\n    *   Example 3: Input (5x5) -> Transposed (5x5) -> Flipped Vertically (5x5) = `core_grid`.\n3.  **Output Structure**: The output grid seems to be constructed by arranging two copies of the `core_grid` vertically, separated and surrounded by a specific border pattern.\n4.  **Output Dimensions Calculation**: Let `core_h` and `core_w` be the height and width of the `core_grid`. The output dimensions are:\n    *   `output_height` = 2 * `core_h` + 3\n    *   `output_width` = `core_w` + 2\n5.  **Border Pattern**:\n    *   The output grid has a border frame (1 pixel thick).\n    *   There is also a horizontal dividing line between the two copies of the `core_grid`.\n    *   The border lines (top, middle, bottom, left, right) are primarily blue (1).\n    *   The corners of the entire output grid are orange (7).\n    *   The intersection points of the middle horizontal border line with the left and right vertical border lines are also orange (7).\n6.  **Content Placement**: The two identical copies of the `core_grid` are placed within the borders:\n    *   The first copy is placed at row index 1, column index 1.\n    *   The second copy is placed at row index `core_h` + 2, column index 1.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

The height of `transposed_grid` is the width of the input grid, and the width of `transposed_grid` is the height of the input grid.\n3.  Create another intermediate grid called `core_grid` by flipping the `transposed_grid` vertically (reversing the order of its rows). The `core_grid` has height `core_h` and width `core_w`.\n4.  Calculate the dimensions for the final output grid: `output_height = (2 * core_h) + 3` and `output_width = core_w + 2`.\n5.  Create the output grid with the calculated `output_height` and `output_width`.\n6.  Iterate through each cell (row `r`, column `c`) of the output grid:\n    a.  Check if the cell is part of the outer horizontal borders (`r == 0` or `r == output_height - 1`) or the middle horizontal border (`r == core_h + 1`).\n        i.  If yes, check if the cell is also part of the vertical borders (`c == 0` or `c == output_width - 1`).\n            1. If yes (it's a corner of a border line), set the cell color to orange (7).\n            2. If no (it's on the horizontal line but not a corner), set the cell color to blue (1).\n    b.  Else (if not on a horizontal border line), check if the cell is part of the vertical borders (`c == 0` or `c == output_width - 1`).\n        i.  If yes, set the cell color to blue (1).\n    c.  Else (the cell is in the content area inside the borders):\n        i.  If the cell's row `r` is between 1 and `core_h` (inclusive), it belongs to the top copy of the `core_grid`. Calculate the corresponding source coordinates: `source_r = r - 1`, `source_c = c - 1`. Set the cell color to the color of the `core_grid` at (`source_r`, `source_c`).\n        ii. If the cell's row `r` is between `core_h + 2` and `output_height - 2` (inclusive), it belongs to the bottom copy of the `core_grid`. Calculate the corresponding source coordinates: `source_r = r - (core_h + 2)`, `source_c = c - 1`. Set the cell color to the color of the `core_grid` at (`source_r`, `source_c`).\n7.
