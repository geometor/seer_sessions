Transformation: Geometric Composition and Framing

Input:
  - type: grid
  - properties:
      - height: H_in
      - width: W_in

Intermediate:
  - name: core_grid
  - derivation:
      - step: Transpose the input grid (swap rows and columns). Resulting dimensions are W_in x H_in.
      - step: Flip the transposed grid vertically. Resulting dimensions remain W_in x H_in.
  - properties:
      - height: core_h = W_in
      - width: core_w = H_in

Output:
  - type: grid
  - properties:
      - height: H_out = 2 * core_h + 3
      - width: W_out = core_w + 2
  - construction:
      - description: A framed composition containing two copies of the core_grid stacked vertically.
      - elements:
          - element: Frame
            - description: A border surrounding the content and a horizontal line separating the two core_grid copies.
            - properties:
                - thickness: 1 pixel
                - color: blue (1)
                - corners_color: orange (7) at grid corners (0,0), (0, W_out-1), (H_out-1, 0), (H_out-1, W_out-1) and middle border corners (core_h+1, 0), (core_h+1, W_out-1).
          - element: Content Blocks (2 instances)
            - source: core_grid
            - placement:
                - instance 1: Top-left corner at (row=1, col=1)
                - instance 2: Top-left corner at (row=core_h + 2, col=1)

Relationships:
  - Output dimensions depend directly on the dimensions of the core_grid (which are derived from the input dimensions).
  - The content of the output grid (excluding the border) is determined solely by the core_grid.
  - The border pattern is fixed (colors blue and orange) and its structure depends on the core_grid dimensions.
