The gray separator line is exactly in the middle vertically.\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output grid has the same width as the input grid and the same height as the top (or bottom) section of the input grid.\n4.  **Transformation:** The output grid appears to be a composite of the top and bottom sections of the input grid. Specifically, it looks like the bottom section is overlaid onto the top section. Where pixels exist in the bottom section (i.e., are non-white/non-zero), they appear in the output grid at the corresponding position. Where pixels in the bottom section are white (zero), the original pixel from the top section is retained in the output. The gray separator line is discarded.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
