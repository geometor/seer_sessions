task_description: Overlay the non-white pixels from the bottom half of the input grid onto the top half, discarding the central gray separator line.

definitions:
  - name: Input Grid
    type: 2D array of integers (colors)
    properties:
      - Contains a single horizontal line composed entirely of gray pixels (color 5).
      - This gray line divides the grid into a top region and a bottom region of equal height.
  - name: Gray Separator Line
    type: Object (horizontal line)
    properties:
      - Color: Gray (5)
      - Location: Central horizontal row.
      - Role: Separates the Top Region and Bottom Region.
  - name: Top Region
    type: Subgrid
    properties:
      - Location: Rows above the Gray Separator Line.
      - Content: Pixels of various colors, including white (0).
      - Dimensions: Defines the height and width of the Output Grid.
  - name: Bottom Region
    type: Subgrid
    properties:
      - Location: Rows below the Gray Separator Line.
      - Content: Pixels of various colors, including white (0).
      - Dimensions: Same height as the Top Region, same width as the Input Grid.
  - name: Output Grid
    type: 2D array of integers (colors)
    properties:
      - Dimensions: Same height and width as the Top Region.
      - Content: Result of overlaying the Bottom Region onto the Top Region.

transformation:
  - action: Identify the Gray Separator Line row index.
  - action: Extract the Top Region (rows above the separator).
  - action: Extract the Bottom Region (rows below the separator).
  - action: Create an Output Grid initialized as a copy of the Top Region.
  - action: Iterate through each cell (row `r`, column `c`) in the Bottom Region.
  - condition: If the pixel value `P_bottom` at `(r, c)` in the Bottom Region is not white (0).
  - consequence: Update the pixel value at the corresponding cell `(r, c)` in the Output Grid to `P_bottom`.
  - relation: The correspondence between Bottom Region cells and Output Grid cells is direct (same row index `r` relative to the start of the region, same column index `c`).
