            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided ARC task examples (`train_1` and `train_2`) to understand the transformation rule.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Size:** Both input and output grids are 8x8 in both examples.\n2.  **Colors:** The grids use three colors: orange (7), red (2), and maroon (9). Orange appears to be the background color.\n3.  **Objects/Patterns:**\n    *   In both inputs, there are distinct groups of red (2) and maroon (9) pixels. Their positions vary between `train_1` and `train_2`.\n    *   In `train_1`, red pixels appear in the bottom-left and bottom-right areas. Maroon pixels are in the top-right.\n    *   In `train_2`, red pixels appear only in the bottom-right. Maroon pixels are in the top-right and top-left areas.\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   Comparing input `train_1` to output `train_1`: The original red pixels are removed. A new solid 4x4 red square appears in the bottom-right quadrant (rows 4-7, columns 4-7). The original maroon pixels remain unchanged.\n    *   Comparing input `train_2` to output `train_2`: The original maroon pixels are removed. A new solid 3x4 maroon rectangle appears in the top-right quadrant (rows 0-2, columns 4-7). The original red pixels remain unchanged.\n5.  **Conditional Logic:** The transformation rule seems conditional. The difference between `train_1` and `train_2` appears to be the trigger for which color (red or maroon) gets modified and replaced by a fixed shape.\n6.  **Trigger Identification:** In `train_1`, red pixels exist in the left half of the grid (columns 0-3). In `train_2`, red pixels exist *only* in the right half (columns 4-7). This presence or absence of red pixels in the left half seems to be the condition determining the transformation rule.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
