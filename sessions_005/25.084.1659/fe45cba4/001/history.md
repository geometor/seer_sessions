Okay, I will analyze the provided ARC task examples (`train_1` and `train_2`) to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Size:** Both input and output grids are 8x8 in both examples.
2.  **Colors:** The grids use three colors: orange (7), red (2), and maroon (9). Orange appears to be the background color.
3.  **Objects/Patterns:**
    *   In both inputs, there are distinct groups of red (2) and maroon (9) pixels. Their positions vary between `train_1` and `train_2`.
    *   In `train_1`, red pixels appear in the bottom-left and bottom-right areas. Maroon pixels are in the top-right.
    *   In `train_2`, red pixels appear only in the bottom-right. Maroon pixels are in the top-right and top-left areas.
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   Comparing input `train_1` to output `train_1`: The original red pixels are removed. A new solid 4x4 red square appears in the bottom-right quadrant (rows 4-7, columns 4-7). The original maroon pixels remain unchanged.
    *   Comparing input `train_2` to output `train_2`: The original maroon pixels are removed. A new solid 3x4 maroon rectangle appears in the top-right quadrant (rows 0-2, columns 4-7). The original red pixels remain unchanged.
5.  **Conditional Logic:** The transformation rule seems conditional. The difference between `train_1` and `train_2` appears to be the trigger for which color (red or maroon) gets modified and replaced by a fixed shape.
6.  **Trigger Identification:** In `train_1`, red pixels exist in the left half of the grid (columns 0-3). In `train_2`, red pixels exist *only* in the right half (columns 4-7). This presence or absence of red pixels in the left half seems to be the condition determining the transformation rule.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the background color, orange (7).
2.  Scan the input grid to determine if any pixel with the color red (2) exists in columns 0, 1, 2, or 3.
3.  **If** at least one red (2) pixel is found in columns 0-3:
    *   Iterate through the input grid. For every pixel that is *not* red (2) (i.e., orange 7 or maroon 9), copy its color to the corresponding position in the output grid.
    *   Fill the rectangular region from row 4, column 4 to row 7, column 7 in the output grid with the color red (2).
4.  **Else** (if no red (2) pixels are found in columns 0-3):
    *   Iterate through the input grid. For every pixel that is *not* maroon (9) (i.e., orange 7 or red 2), copy its color to the corresponding position in the output grid.
    *   Fill the rectangular region from row 0, column 4 to row 2, column 7 in the output grid with the color maroon (9).
5.  Return the completed output grid.
