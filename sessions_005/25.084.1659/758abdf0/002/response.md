**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code attempted to solve the task based on observations likely derived only from the first example (or an incomplete analysis). The core logic identified involved finding vertical pairs of Azure pixels (8) and performing actions based on the grid's aspect ratio (Tall/Square vs. Wide).

However, testing against the examples reveals:
1.  **Example 1 Failure:** The code failed because the input grid contains *horizontal* Azure pairs, not vertical ones. The transformation logic in the expected output for Example 1 involves placing White pixels (0) based on the row of the horizontal pair, which the code did not account for. Additionally, the code incorrectly assumed the Azure pairs should change to Orange (7), which doesn't happen in either expected output. The transformed output was identical to the input, indicating the code's conditions for action were not met.
2.  **Example 2 Success:** The code *reportedly* produced the correct output for Example 2, which features a *vertical* Azure pair in a Wide grid. The expected transformation involves placing White pixels at the bottom of the pair's column and copying other Azure pixels from the upper row of the pair down one level. While the report shows success, the *provided code* includes logic to change the vertical pair to Orange, which is *not* seen in the expected output. This suggests either the execution report is based on a slightly different (corrected) version of the code, or the color change logic was simply ignored or overridden in the specific execution environment. Assuming the *expected output* is the ground truth, the Azure pairs should *not* change color.

**Strategy:**

The strategy is to revise the transformation logic based on *both* examples. The key seems to be the *orientation* of the adjacent Azure pair (horizontal or vertical), which dictates the subsequent actions (placement of White markers and potentially copying other pixels). The aspect ratio might influence *where* markers are placed or *if* copying occurs, but the primary trigger is the pair orientation.

1.  Identify both horizontal and vertical adjacent pairs of Azure pixels.
2.  Define distinct actions based on the pair's orientation.
3.  Refine the marker placement rules and the pixel copying rule based on observations from both examples.
4.  Remove the incorrect color change logic (Azure pairs remain Azure).
5.  Verify boundary conditions for marker placement (e.g., grids with width or height less than 2).

      - Horizontal pairs trigger White (0) markers placed horizontally at the right edge of the grid, in the same row as the pair.
      - Vertical pairs trigger White (0) markers placed vertically at the bottom edge of the grid, in the same column as the pair.
      - Vertical pairs *also* trigger a copy action: Azure pixels in the pair's upper row (r) that are *not* part of *any* vertical pair starting in that row are copied to the row below (r+1).
      - Marker placement requires checking boundary conditions (W >= 2 for horizontal, H >= 2 for vertical).

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find all horizontally adjacent pairs of Azure (8) pixels in the input grid. A horizontal pair exists at `(r, c)` and `(r, c+1)` if both pixels have the value 8.
3.  For each horizontal pair found at `(r, c)` and `(r, c+1)`:
    *   If the grid width `W` is 2 or greater, change the pixels at `(r, W-2)` and `(r, W-1)` in the output grid to White (0).
    *   If the grid width `W` is 1, this rule cannot apply as stated (W-2 is invalid), but also a horizontal pair cannot exist. Check if only one marker `(r, W-1)` should be placed if W=1 - this scenario seems unlikely given the marker placement rule `W-2` and `W-1`. Assume W>=2 for horizontal pair action.
4.  Find all vertically adjacent pairs of Azure (8) pixels in the input grid. A vertical pair exists at `(r, c)` and `(r+1, c)` if both pixels have the value 8.
5.  Create a set of coordinates `(r, c)` for all Azure pixels that are the *top* pixel of any vertical pair found in step 4. This is needed for the copy logic.
6.  For each vertical pair found at `(r, c)` and `(r+1, c)`:
    *   **Marker Placement:** If the grid height `H` is 2 or greater, change the pixels at `(H-2, c)` and `(H-1, c)` in the output grid to White (0).
    *   **Pixel Copying:** Iterate through all columns `col_idx` from 0 to `W-1` in the input grid's row `r`. If the pixel `input_grid[r, col_idx]` is Azure (8) *and* the coordinate `(r, col_idx)` is *not* in the set of top-pixels-of-vertical-pairs (created in step 5), then change the pixel at `(r+1, col_idx)` in the output grid to Azure (8). This copy action occurs regardless of the original value at `output_grid[r+1, col_idx]`.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
