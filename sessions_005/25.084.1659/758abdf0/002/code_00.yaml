description: Analysis of two examples for an ARC task involving adjacent Azure pixels.
observations:
  - task: Find adjacent pairs of Azure (8) pixels and modify the grid based on the pair's orientation.
  - examples:
      - id: 1
        input_grid:
          height: 16
          width: 8
          aspect_ratio: Tall (H > W)
        objects:
          - type: Azure pixel
            color: 8
            locations: [(3, 1), (3, 2), (5, 1), (7, 1), (10, 1), (12, 1), (12, 2), (15, 1)]
          - type: Horizontal Azure pair
            color: 8
            locations: [((3, 1), (3, 2)), ((12, 1), (12, 2))]
        actions:
          - trigger: Horizontal Azure pair at (r, c), (r, c+1)
          - action: Place two White (0) pixels at (r, W-2) and (r, W-1).
            details: For pair at (3,1),(3,2), markers are at (3, 6), (3, 7). For pair at (12,1),(12,2), markers are at (12, 6), (12, 7).
          - note: The original Azure pairs remain unchanged.
        code_result: Failed (No changes made by previous code).
      - id: 2
        input_grid:
          height: 8
          width: 16
          aspect_ratio: Wide (W > H)
        objects:
          - type: Azure pixel
            color: 8
            locations: [(1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 11), (1, 13), (2, 5)]
          - type: Vertical Azure pair
            color: 8
            locations: [((1, 5), (2, 5))]
        actions:
          - trigger: Vertical Azure pair at (r, c), (r+1, c)
          - action_1: Place two White (0) pixels at (H-2, c) and (H-1, c).
            details: For pair at (1,5),(2,5), markers are at (6, 5), (7, 5).
          - action_2: Copy other Azure pixels from row 'r' to row 'r+1'.
            details: Input Azure at (1, 2), (1, 11), (1, 13) are copied to Output at (2, 2), (2, 11), (2, 13).
          - note: The original Azure pair remains unchanged.
        code_result: Succeeded (as reported, despite potential code discrepancy regarding color change).
  - general_rules:
      - The transformation depends on the orientation of adjacent Azure (8) pixel pairs.
      - Azure pairs themselves do not change color.
      - Horizontal pairs trigger White (0) markers placed horizontally at the right edge of the grid, in the same row as the pair.
      - Vertical pairs trigger White (0) markers placed vertically at the bottom edge of the grid, in the same column as the pair.
      - Vertical pairs *also* trigger a copy action: Azure pixels in the pair's upper row (r) that are *not* part of *any* vertical pair starting in that row are copied to the row below (r+1).
      - Marker placement requires checking boundary conditions (W >= 2 for horizontal, H >= 2 for vertical).
