            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for task `train_1` and `train_2`.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The grids vary in size (16x8 for train_1, 8x16 for train_2). The primary colors involved are White (0), Orange (7), and Azure (8). Often, there's a background color (Orange 7) and potentially a border or initial row/column of a different color (White 0).\n2.  **Key Objects:** The most active elements are the Azure (8) pixels. Their arrangement and interaction seem crucial.\n3.  **Transformation Trigger:** The core event triggering changes appears to be the presence of two Azure (8) pixels vertically adjacent to each other in the input grid. Let's call the coordinates of the upper pixel `(r, c)` and the lower one `(r+1, c)`.\n4.  **Direct Effect:** When such a vertical pair is found, both Azure (8) pixels at `(r, c)` and `(r+1, c)` are changed to Orange (7) in the output grid.\n5.  **Indirect Effect (White Pixels):** The presence of the pair also causes two other pixels, originally Orange (7), to change to White (0). The location of these White (0) pixels depends on the grid's aspect ratio:\n    *   **Tall/Square Grids (Height >= Width):** As seen in train_1 (16x8), the White (0) pixels appear in the *same row* as the *upper* pixel of the pair (`r`), but at the far right columns: `(r, W-2)` and `(r, W-1)`, where W is the grid width.\n    *   **Wide Grids (Width > Height):** As seen in train_2 (8x16), the White (0) pixels appear in the *same column* as the pair (`c`), but in the bottom-most rows: `(H-2, c)` and `(H-1, c)`, where H is the grid height.\n6.  **Indirect Effect (Azure Copying - Wide Grids Only):** Specifically for wide grids (W > H), as observed in train_2, another effect occurs. All Azure (8) pixels located in the *same row* as the *upper* pixel of the pair (`r`) in the *input* grid are effectively \"copied\" down to the next row (`r+1`) in the *output* grid, overwriting whatever was there. However, the Azure (8) pixel that was part of the original vertical pair (`(r, c)`) is *not* copied. This copying effect was not observed in the taller grid (train_1).\n7.  **Default Behavior:** Pixels not involved in these specific transformations (finding pairs, changing to Orange, changing to White, copying Azure) remain unchanged from the input to the output grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
