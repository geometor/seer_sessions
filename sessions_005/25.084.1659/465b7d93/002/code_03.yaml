task_description: Fill an area enclosed by a boundary with a specific color, after removing the object of that color from its original position. The fill behavior depends on the color's value relative to the boundary color.

grid_properties:
  - Grid contains exactly three colors.
  - Background Color: The most frequent color in the input grid.
  - Boundary Object: Composed of pixels with color value 6 (Magenta). Forms a closed loop, defining an interior and exterior.
  - Fill Source Object: Composed of pixels of the third color (neither background nor boundary). Can be located anywhere in the grid.

transformation_steps:
  - 1. Identify Objects:
      - Determine the background color (most frequent).
      - Identify the boundary object (pixels with color 6).
      - Identify the fill source object (pixels with the remaining color) and its color (Fill Color).
  - 2. Prepare Output Grid: Create a copy of the input grid.
  - 3. Remove Fill Source Object: Change the color of all pixels belonging to the fill source object in the output grid to the background color.
  - 4. Identify Interior Region:
      - Find all background pixels in the original input grid that are not reachable from the grid's edges without crossing the boundary object pixels. This is the set of 'Interior Background Pixels'.
  - 5. Conditional Fill:
      - Compare the Fill Color value (`C_fill`) with the Boundary Color value (`C_boundary` = 6).
      - Case 1 (`C_fill < C_boundary`):
          - Fill all 'Interior Background Pixels' in the output grid with the Fill Color.
      - Case 2 (`C_fill > C_boundary`):
          - Determine the bounding box (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c) of the 'Interior Background Pixels'.
          - Define an L-shaped region consisting of:
              - The leftmost column of the bounding box within the 'Interior Background Pixels': `{(r, min_c) | min_r <= r <= max_r}` intersected with 'Interior Background Pixels'.
              - The bottommost row of the bounding box (excluding the corner pixel already included) within the 'Interior Background Pixels': `{(max_r, c) | min_c < c <= max_c}` intersected with 'Interior Background Pixels'.
          - Fill all pixels belonging to this L-shaped region in the output grid with the Fill Color.

final_output: The modified grid after removing the fill source object and applying the conditional fill.
