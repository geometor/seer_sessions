            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception of Task Elements\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels. The size is consistent within each example (10x10).\n2.  **Colors:** Several colors are used: orange (7) appears to be the background, magenta (6) forms shapes, and gray (5), red (2), or azure (8) appear as distinct objects or fill colors.\n3.  **Objects:**\n    *   **Background:** The predominant color, orange (7), fills most of the grid space initially.\n    *   **Boundary Object:** In each example, there is a closed shape made of magenta (6) pixels. This shape acts like a container or boundary. In examples 1 and 3, it's a hollow rectangle. In example 2, it's a 'C' shape which, combined with the grid edges, likely encloses an area.\n    *   **Fill Source Object:** There is another distinct object made of a single color (gray 5, red 2, or azure 8) located somewhere else in the grid, outside the magenta boundary.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve using the \"Fill Source Object\" to color the area *inside* the \"Boundary Object\".\n    *   The \"Fill Source Object\" itself disappears from its original location (replaced by the background color).\n    *   The area inside the magenta boundary, which was initially the background color, is completely filled with the color of the \"Fill Source Object\".\n    *   The magenta boundary itself remains unchanged.\n    *   The background outside the boundary remains unchanged.\n5.  **Inside/Outside:** The concept of being \"inside\" the magenta boundary is crucial. This refers to the region enclosed by the boundary loop. Pixels are considered inside if they are surrounded by the boundary color and were originally the background color.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

These are coordinates where the pixel color is `background_color` but which cannot be reached by a path starting from any edge of the grid without crossing over a pixel belonging to the `boundary_object`.\n7.  **Fill Interior:** For every coordinate `(r, c)` identified as being inside the boundary, change the pixel color in the output grid to the `fill_color`.\n8.  **Final Output:** The modified grid is the result."
