task_description: Fill the area enclosed by a boundary object with the color of another object, then remove the source object.
grid_properties:
  - size: Consistent between input and output (e.g., 10x10).
  - background_color: The most frequent color in the input grid (orange 7 in examples).
objects:
  - object_type: boundary
    properties:
      - color: magenta (6) in examples
      - shape: Forms a closed loop (e.g., rectangle, C-shape against edge).
      - role: Defines an enclosed region.
      - persistence: Remains unchanged in the output.
  - object_type: fill_source
    properties:
      - color: Varies (gray 5, red 2, azure 8 in examples).
      - shape: Varies (square, single pixel, L-shape).
      - location: Outside the region enclosed by the boundary object.
      - role: Determines the color used to fill the enclosed region.
      - persistence: Removed from the output grid (pixels changed to background color).
  - object_type: enclosed_region
    properties:
      - location: Inside the boundary object.
      - initial_color: Same as the background color.
      - final_color: Same as the fill_source object's color.
      - role: Target area for the fill operation.
transformation:
  - action: identify_background
    using: frequency analysis
  - action: identify_objects
    using: connectivity of non-background colors
  - action: classify_objects
    based_on: properties (color, shape, location relative to boundary) into 'boundary' and 'fill_source'
  - action: remove_object
    target: fill_source object
    effect: Change its pixels to background color.
  - action: identify_enclosed_region
    using: boundary object and background color pixels unreachable from grid edges without crossing the boundary.
  - action: fill_region
    target: enclosed_region
    using: color of the fill_source object
