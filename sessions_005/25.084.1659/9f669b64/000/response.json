The shift distance appears related to half the size of the gap.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Identify all distinct contiguous non-background colored objects in the input grid.\n    3.  By comparing the input and output grids, determine the roles of the three objects:\n        *   **Stable Object:** The object whose position and pixels remain identical in the output.\n        *   **Moving Object:** The object whose pixels change location but maintain the same relative shape and color. Find its original bounding box.\n        *   **Split Object:** The object whose pixels change location and form two separate pieces in the output. Find its original bounding box.\n    4.  Determine the primary direction of movement (Up, Down, Left, or Right) for the **Moving Object** by observing its displacement towards a grid edge.\n    5.  Determine the axis of the split for the **Split Object**: if movement is vertical (Up/Down), the split is horizontal; if movement is horizontal (Left/Right), the split is vertical.\n    6.  Calculate the gap dimension: this is the width of the **Moving Object** if the split is horizontal, or the height of the **Moving Object** if the split is vertical.\n    7.  Calculate the gap location: these are the original columns covered by the **Moving Object** if the split is horizontal, or the original rows covered by the **Moving Object** if the split is vertical.\n    8.  Calculate the shift distance required for the split: `shift = gap_dimension / 2`.\n    9.  Create the output grid, initially filled with the background color.\n    10. Draw the **Stable Object** onto the output grid at its original position.\n    11. Split the **Split Object**:\n        *   If splitting horizontally: For each pixel of the **Split Object**, if its column is less than the minimum gap column, draw it shifted left by `shift` columns in the output grid. If its column is greater than the maximum gap column, draw it shifted right by `shift` columns in the output grid.\n        *   If splitting vertically: For each pixel of the **Split Object**, if its row is less than the minimum gap row, draw it shifted up by `shift` rows in the output grid. If its row is greater than the maximum gap row, draw it shifted down by `shift` rows in the output grid.\n    12. Determine the final top-left corner position for the **Moving Object**:\n        *   If moving Up: `(0, original_min_col)`\n        *   If moving Down: `(grid_height - moving_object_height, original_min_col)`\n        *   If moving Left: `(original_min_row, 0)`\n        *   If moving Right: `(original_min_row, grid_width - moving_object_width)`\n    13. Draw the **Moving Object** at this calculated final position onto the output grid."
