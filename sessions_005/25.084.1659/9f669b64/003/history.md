"""
Identifies three non-background objects in the input grid: stable, moving, and split.
The moving object is typically positioned between the other two along one axis.
It moves towards the nearest grid edge along the axis perpendicular to the alignment with the other objects.
As it moves, it effectively splits the object it moves towards (the split object) into two halves.
The split occurs along an axis perpendicular to the moving object's direction of travel.
A gap is created in the split object, matching the dimension of the moving object along the split axis.
The two halves of the split object are shifted outwards from this gap, each by half the gap's dimension.
The moving object ends up positioned at the edge it moved towards, aligned with its original position along the axis parallel to its movement.
The stable object remains unchanged.
The output grid is composed of the stable object in its original place, the two pieces of the split object in their new shifted positions, and the moving object in its final position at the edge, all on the original background color.

## General Assessment

The provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying three objects, assigning them roles (moving, stable, split), moving one object to an edge, and splitting another. However, the results show significant discrepancies between the expected and transformed outputs across all examples.

**Key Issues Identified:**

1.  **Role Identification:** The logic for determining which object is stable and which is split seems flawed. The current code relies on the relative position of the non-moving objects after identifying the mover, which doesn't align with the observed transformations.
2.  **Movement Direction:** The code incorrectly determines the direction of movement. It seems to prioritize horizontal movement when alignment is vertical and vice-versa. The correct logic should be: if objects are aligned vertically (mover is between others vertically), movement is vertical; if aligned horizontally, movement is horizontal. The direction (Up/Down or Left/Right) depends on the nearest edge along the movement axis.
3.  **Splitting Logic:** While the concept of splitting based on the mover's dimension is present, its application is incorrect. The calculation of the shift amount and the placement of the split pieces need revision. Specifically, the pieces should shift outwards from the gap created by the mover. The shift amount calculation needs careful handling, especially for odd dimensions, `(gap_dim + 1) // 2` seems more robust than `gap_dim // 2`.
4.  **Final Placement:** The final positions of the mover and the split object pieces are incorrect in the generated outputs.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Refine Role Identification:** Correctly identify the mover based on its intermediate position. Then, determine the movement direction based on the nearest edge along the axis of alignment (vertical movement for vertical alignment, horizontal for horizontal). The 'stable' object will be the one *not* between the mover and the target edge. The 'split' object will be the one *between* the mover and the target edge.
2.  **Correct Movement Logic:** Implement the corrected movement direction logic described above.
3.  **Revise Splitting Mechanism:**
    *   Determine the split axis (perpendicular to movement).
    *   Calculate the gap dimension based on the mover's size along the split axis.
    *   Calculate the shift amount using `shift = (gap_dim + 1) // 2`.
    *   Identify the pixels of the split object on either side of the gap (defined by the mover's original position along the split axis).
    *   Apply the calculated shift to these sets of pixels, moving them away from the gap center.
4.  **Ensure Correct Final Placement:** Place the stable object, the shifted split pieces, and the moved object (at the target edge, aligned with its original parallel position) onto a new background grid.

## Metrics and Observations

We will use python code execution to extract properties for each example.

**Correction:** The automatic role identification in the `analyze_example` function is flawed, misidentifying roles and therefore subsequent properties in some cases. Relying on the output object count and position is unreliable for identifying roles *before* fully understanding the transformation.

Let's re-evaluate based on the manual analysis performed earlier in the thought process.

**Corrected Analysis based on Manual Inspection:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Grid: 10x10, Background: 7 (orange)
    *   Input Objects: Maroon(9) bbox(2,3,3,6), Green(3) bbox(4,4,5,5), Azure(8) bbox(6,4,9,5)
    *   Alignment: Vertical (Green between Maroon and Azure)
    *   Movement Axis: Vertical
    *   Mover: Green(3). Bbox(4,4,5,5). Height=2, Width=2.
    *   Distances: Dist Up (from row 4) = 4. Dist Down (from row 5) = 10-1-5 = 4. Move **Up**.
    *   Target Edge: Top (row 0)
    *   Stable: Azure(8) (further from top edge). Bbox(6,4,9,5).
    *   Split: Maroon(9) (between mover and top edge). Bbox(2,3,3,6).
    *   Split Axis: Horizontal (perpendicular to Up movement).
    *   Gap Dimension: Mover Width = 2.
    *   Gap Location (Cols): Mover bbox cols = 4, 5.
    *   Shift Amount: `(2+1)//2 = 1`.
    *   Split Action: Maroon pixels with col < 4 shift left by 1. Maroon pixels with col > 5 shift right by 1. Pixels at col 4, 5 are removed.
    *   Final Positions:
        *   Azure(8): Unchanged at bbox(6,4,9,5).
        *   Green(3): At top edge, original cols. Bbox(0,4,1,5).
        *   Maroon(9) piece 1: Original pixels at bbox(2,3,3,3) shifted right by 1 -> bbox(2,2,3,2). *Correction*: Left piece shifts left by 1 -> Bbox(2,2,3,2).
        *   Maroon(9) piece 2: Original pixels at bbox(2,6,3,6) shifted right by 1 -> bbox(2,7,3,7).

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Grid: 10x10, Background: 7 (orange)
    *   Input Objects: Magenta(6) bbox(0,3,2,6), Blue(1) bbox(3,4,5,5), Azure(8) bbox(6,2,9,7)
    *   Alignment: Vertical (Blue between Magenta and Azure)
    *   Movement Axis: Vertical
    *   Mover: Blue(1). Bbox(3,4,5,5). Height=3, Width=2.
    *   Distances: Dist Up (from row 3) = 3. Dist Down (from row 5) = 10-1-5 = 4. Move **Up**. *Correction*: My manual calculation was wrong. Let's re-check expected output. Blue(1) ends at bottom. Azure(8) is split. Magenta(6) is stable. So Blue must move Down. Dist Up=3, Dist Down=4. The rule "move to nearest edge" might be wrong, or my distance calc. Let's re-read initial code comments: "moves towards the nearest grid edge along the axis perpendicular to the alignment". This matches my analysis. Why does blue move down? Let's check the output again. Blue(1) ends up with its top edge at row 8 (bbox=(8,4,9,5), height 2? input height was 3). Azure is split. Stable is Magenta. So, Blue moved Down. Dist Up = 3. Dist Down = 4. Maybe it moves away from the *closest* object? Or towards the *larger* gap? Let's assume "nearest edge" rule holds and maybe my bbox/distance was off. Mover Blue bbox=(3,4,5,5). Top=3, Bottom=5. Grid height=10. Dist_Up = 3. Dist_Down = 10 - 1 - 5 = 4. Nearest is Up. The expected output requires Down movement. **Hypothesis Adjustment:** Maybe the direction isn't nearest edge, but determined by which object (split/stable) is closer/further? Or maybe the 'between' check needs refinement? Let's assume for now the expected output implies Down movement despite distance calculation.
    *   Movement: Down.
    *   Target Edge: Bottom (row 9)
    *   Stable: Magenta(6) (further from bottom edge). Bbox(0,3,2,6).
    *   Split: Azure(8) (between mover and bottom edge). Bbox(6,2,9,7).
    *   Split Axis: Horizontal (perpendicular to Down movement).
    *   Gap Dimension: Mover Width = 2.
    *   Gap Location (Cols): Mover bbox cols = 4, 5.
    *   Shift Amount: `(2+1)//2 = 1`.
    *   Split Action: Azure pixels with col < 4 shift left by 1. Azure pixels with col > 5 shift right by 1. Pixels at col 4, 5 removed.
    *   Final Positions:
        *   Magenta(6): Unchanged at bbox(0,3,2,6).
        *   Blue(1): At bottom edge, original cols. Original height=3. Final bbox should be (7,4,9,5). *Expected output shows Blue as 2x2 at (8,4,9,5). This implies the mover might change shape/size or the target position isn't simply grid_height - mover_height*. Let's stick to the input shape for now: Final Bbox(7,4,9,5).
        *   Azure(8) piece 1: Original pixels left of col 4 shifted left by 1.
        *   Azure(8) piece 2: Original pixels right of col 5 shifted right by 1.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Grid: 10x10, Background: 7 (orange)
    *   Input Objects: Yellow(4) bbox(3,1,7,1), Blue(1) bbox(4,6,5,7), Red(2) bbox(2,8,7,9)
    *   Alignment: Horizontal (Blue between Yellow and Red)
    *   Movement Axis: Horizontal
    *   Mover: Blue(1). Bbox(4,6,5,7). Height=2, Width=2.
    *   Distances: Dist Left (from col 6) = 6. Dist Right (from col 7) = 10-1-7 = 2. Move **Right**. *Correction*: Expected output shows Blue(1) moved Left. Yellow(4) is split. Red(2) is stable. Blue must move Left. Dist Left=6, Dist Right=2. Nearest is Right. Again, the "nearest edge" rule seems contradicted by the expected output. Let's proceed assuming Left movement is required.
    *   Movement: Left.
    *   Target Edge: Left (col 0)
    *   Stable: Red(2) (further from left edge). Bbox(2,8,7,9).
    *   Split: Yellow(4) (between mover and left edge). Bbox(3,1,7,1).
    *   Split Axis: Vertical (perpendicular to Left movement).
    *   Gap Dimension: Mover Height = 2.
    *   Gap Location (Rows): Mover bbox rows = 4, 5.
    *   Shift Amount: `(2+1)//2 = 1`.
    *   Split Action: Yellow pixels with row < 4 shift up by 1. Yellow pixels with row > 5 shift down by 1. Pixels at row 4, 5 removed.
    *   Final Positions:
        *   Red(2): Unchanged at bbox(2,8,7,9).
        *   Blue(1): At left edge, original rows. Bbox(4,0,5,1).
        *   Yellow(4) piece 1: Original pixels at bbox(3,1,3,1) shifted up by 1 -> bbox(2,1,2,1).
        *   Yellow(4) piece 2: Original pixels at bbox(6,1,7,1) shifted down by 1 -> bbox(7,1,8,1).

**Revised Hypothesis on Direction:** The movement is *not* towards the nearest edge. It seems consistently towards the object identified as the 'split' object, pushing it and splitting it, while the mover continues to the edge. The 'stable' object is the one not in the path of movement.

**Let's redefine roles based on this:**
1. Identify the three objects.
2. Find the 'mover' (object M) positioned between the other two (A and B) along one axis (vertical or horizontal).
3. Determine the axis of movement (vertical if M is between A and B vertically, horizontal otherwise).
4. Identify the 'split' object (S) as the one *closer* to M along the axis of movement.
5. Identify the 'stable' object (T) as the one *further* from M along the axis of movement.
6. The direction of movement is *towards* the 'split' object S (and the corresponding edge).
7. The 'stable' object T remains unchanged.
8. The 'split' object S is split along the axis perpendicular to movement, using the mover M's dimension along that perpendicular axis to define the gap size. The gap is centered on M's original position. The pieces shift away from the gap by `(gap_dim + 1) // 2`.
9. The 'mover' M moves to the edge it was heading towards, maintaining its alignment along the axis parallel to movement.

Let's re-check examples with this:
*   Ex 1: M=Green(3), A=Maroon(9), B=Azure(8). Vertical alignment. Movement axis=Vertical. Maroon is closer to Green than Azure is. Split=Maroon(9). Stable=Azure(8). Direction=Towards Maroon = Up. Matches.
*   Ex 2: M=Blue(1), A=Magenta(6), B=Azure(8). Vertical alignment. Movement axis=Vertical. Azure is closer to Blue than Magenta is. Split=Azure(8). Stable=Magenta(6). Direction=Towards Azure = Down. Matches.
*   Ex 3: M=Blue(1), A=Yellow(4), B=Red(2). Horizontal alignment. Movement axis=Horizontal. Yellow is closer to Blue than Red is. Split=Yellow(4). Stable=Red(2). Direction=Towards Yellow = Left. Matches.

This revised hypothesis fits all examples regarding role identification and movement direction.

## Facts (YAML)


```yaml
task_description: Identifies three non-background objects aligned along a primary axis (vertical or horizontal). One object (mover) is between the other two. The mover moves towards the closer of the other two objects (the split object), continuing to the nearest edge along that path. The split object is divided perpendicular to the mover's path, creating a gap matching the mover's dimension along the split axis, and its pieces shift away from the gap. The third object (stable) remains unchanged.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the background color (most frequent color).
2.  Find all distinct, contiguous non-background objects. There should be exactly three.
3.  Determine the primary axis of alignment: Check if one object's center coordinate is between the other two objects' center coordinates along the vertical axis (rows) or the horizontal axis (columns). This identifies the 'mover' object and the axis of alignment.
4.  Determine Roles and Movement Direction:
    *   Let the mover be M, and the other two objects be A and B.
    *   If aligned vertically (M between A and B vertically), the movement axis is vertical. Identify which of A or B is closer to M vertically; this is the 'split' object (S). The other object is 'stable' (T). The movement direction is towards S (Up if S is above M, Down if S is below M).
    *   If aligned horizontally (M between A and B horizontally), the movement axis is horizontal. Identify which of A or B is closer to M horizontally; this is the 'split' object (S). The other object is 'stable' (T). The movement direction is towards S (Left if S is left of M, Right if S is right of M).
5.  Create the Output Grid: Initialize a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.
6.  Place the Stable Object: Copy the pixels of the 'stable' object (T) to their original locations in the output grid.
7.  Perform the Split and Shift:
    *   Determine the split axis (perpendicular to the movement axis).
    *   Calculate the gap dimension (`gap_dim`) using the size of the mover (M) along the split axis (mover's width if split is horizontal, mover's height if split is vertical).
    *   Calculate the shift amount: `shift = (gap_dim + 1) // 2`.
    *   Identify the coordinates defining the gap, based on the mover's (M) original bounding box along the split axis.
    *   For each pixel of the 'split' object (S):
        *   If the pixel's coordinate along the split axis falls *before* the gap range, calculate its new position by shifting it *away* from the gap by `shift` units along the split axis.
        *   If the pixel's coordinate along the split axis falls *after* the gap range, calculate its new position by shifting it *away* from the gap by `shift` units along the split axis.
        *   If the pixel's coordinate falls *within* the gap range, it is removed (not drawn).
        *   Draw the shifted pixel in the output grid if it falls within the grid boundaries.
8.  Place the Mover Object:
    *   Determine the final bounding box for the mover (M) at the target edge.
        *   If moving Up: top row = 0, columns = original mover columns.
        *   If moving Down: top row = grid height - mover height, columns = original mover columns.
        *   If moving Left: rows = original mover rows, left column = 0.
        *   If moving Right: rows = original mover rows, left column = grid width - mover width.
    *   Copy the pixels of the mover object (M), translated to this final bounding box, onto the output grid. *(Self-correction: Consider the potential size change observed in Example 2. If the mover changes size, the rule needs modification. For now, assume it retains its original shape/size).*
