task_description: Identifies three non-background objects aligned along a primary axis (vertical or horizontal). One object (mover) is between the other two. The mover moves towards the closer of the other two objects (the split object), continuing to the nearest edge along that path. The split object is divided perpendicular to the mover's path, creating a gap matching the mover's dimension along the split axis, and its pieces shift away from the gap. The third object (stable) remains unchanged.

example_1:
  grid_dims: [10, 10]
  background_color: 7 # orange
  objects:
    - color: 9 # maroon
      role: split
      bbox: [2, 3, 3, 6] # top
    - color: 3 # green
      role: mover
      bbox: [4, 4, 5, 5] # middle
      height: 2
      width: 2
    - color: 8 # azure
      role: stable
      bbox: [6, 4, 9, 5] # bottom
  alignment: vertical
  movement:
    mover: 3 # green
    direction: Up
    axis: vertical
    target_edge: top
  split_action:
    split_object: 9 # maroon
    stable_object: 8 # azure
    split_axis: Horizontal
    gap_dimension: 2 # mover width
    gap_center_cols: [4, 5]
    shift_amount: 1 # (2+1)//2

example_2:
  grid_dims: [10, 10]
  background_color: 7 # orange
  objects:
    - color: 6 # magenta
      role: stable
      bbox: [0, 3, 2, 6] # top
    - color: 1 # blue
      role: mover
      bbox: [3, 4, 5, 5] # middle
      height: 3
      width: 2
    - color: 8 # azure
      role: split
      bbox: [6, 2, 9, 7] # bottom
  alignment: vertical
  movement:
    mover: 1 # blue
    direction: Down
    axis: vertical
    target_edge: bottom
  split_action:
    split_object: 8 # azure
    stable_object: 6 # magenta
    split_axis: Horizontal
    gap_dimension: 2 # mover width
    gap_center_cols: [4, 5]
    shift_amount: 1 # (2+1)//2
  # Observation: Mover appears smaller (2x2) in output at [8,4,9,5]. Input was 3x2.
