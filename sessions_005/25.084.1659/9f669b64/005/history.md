"""
Identifies three non-background objects aligned along a primary axis (vertical or horizontal).
One object (mover) is positioned between the other two.
The mover moves towards the closer of the other two objects (the split object), continuing to the nearest grid edge along that path.
The split object is divided perpendicular to the mover's path.
A gap is created in the split object, matching the mover's dimension along the split axis.
The pieces of the split object shift away from this gap.
The third object (stable) remains unchanged.
The output grid contains the stable object, the shifted pieces of the split object, and the mover at its final position on the edge.

## General Assessment

The provided Python code attempts to solve the task based on an initial hypothesis derived likely from the first example. The hypothesis involves three objects aligned along an axis, where the middle object ("mover") moves towards the closer of the other two ("split object"), splits it, and travels to the nearest edge. The third object ("stable object") remains unchanged.

However, the code fails on all three training examples, indicating that the initial hypothesis or its implementation is flawed.

*   **Example 1 Failure:** The mover (Green) seems correctly placed, and the stable object (Azure) is correct. However, the split object (Maroon) is split incorrectly. The gap seems too narrow, and the resulting pieces are not shifted correctly. Pixels Off: 4.
*   **Example 2 Failure:** The code seems to misidentify the roles of the objects, leading to incorrect movement and splitting. The mover (Blue) should move down towards Azure, splitting Azure. Instead, the transformed output shows Blue moved towards the top left, and Magenta (which should be stable) appears partially split. Pixels Off: 30.
*   **Example 3 Failure:** Similar to Example 2, role identification seems incorrect. The mover (Blue) should move right towards Red, splitting Red. The output shows Blue moved incorrectly, and the splitting of Red is wrong. Pixels Off: 18.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Object Properties:** Use `tool_code` to precisely determine the bounding boxes, centers, and dimensions of all objects in each input example.
2.  **Re-evaluate Role Identification:** The logic for determining the mover, split, and stable objects based on alignment and proximity needs refinement. The current overlap checks and center comparisons might be insufficient or incorrect.
3.  **Refine Splitting Logic:** The method for determining the split location, gap size, and shift amount needs to be corrected based on observations across all examples. The gap appears to align with the mover's bounding box along the axis perpendicular to movement, and the shift amount needs to ensure the gap is correctly sized.
4.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Formulate a revised, more accurate natural language program based on the corrected understanding.
5.  **Update YAML Facts:** Document the refined understanding of objects, roles, and actions.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's gather precise information about the objects in each example.

## YAML Fact Block


```yaml
task_description: Analyze three non-background objects; one moves towards the closer of the other two along a primary axis (vertical or horizontal), splitting it and moving to the grid edge.

constants:
  background_color: The most frequent color in the input grid.
  num_objects: 3 (non-background).

objects:
  - role: mover
    description: The object positioned between the other two along a primary axis.
    properties:
      color: Specific color per example.
      shape: Rectangular or near-rectangular in examples.
      size: Varies.
      bbox: Bounding box.
      center: Bounding box center.
    action:
      - Identify the closer of the other two objects (split_object).
      - Determine movement direction towards split_object (Up, Down, Left, or Right).
      - Move along the determined axis until its leading edge reaches the corresponding grid boundary.
      - Final position: At the edge of the grid, aligned with its original position along the perpendicular axis.
  - role: split_object
    description: The object closer to the mover along the axis of alignment.
    properties:
      color: Specific color per example.
      shape: Rectangular or near-rectangular in examples.
      size: Varies.
      bbox: Bounding box.
      center: Bounding box center.
    action:
      - Is split perpendicular to the mover's movement direction.
      - The split creates a gap aligned with the mover's bounding box along the split axis.
      - Gap dimension: Equal to the mover's width (for vertical movement) or height (for horizontal movement).
      - Gap position: Aligned with the mover's column(s) (for vertical movement) or row(s) (for horizontal movement).
      - The two resulting pieces are shifted away from the gap.
      - Shift amount: Seems to be `ceil(gap_dimension / 2)`. For a gap of 2, shift is 1.
      - Final state: Two separate pieces positioned further apart than originally, maintaining their original extent along the movement axis.
  - role: stable_object
    description: The object further from the mover along the axis of alignment.
    properties:
      color: Specific color per example.
      shape: Rectangular or near-rectangular in examples.
      size: Varies.
      bbox: Bounding box.
      center: Bounding box center.
    action:
      - Remains unchanged in the output grid.
      - Final state: Identical position and shape as in the input.

identification_logic:
  - Find the three non-background objects.
  - Check for vertical alignment:
    - Find an object `M` whose center row `M_r` is between the center rows `A_r` and `B_r` of the other two objects (`A` and `B`).
    - Check if the column range of `M`'s bounding box overlaps with the column ranges of *both* `A` and `B`.
    - If yes, `M` is the mover, movement is vertical. The object (`A` or `B`) with center row closer to `M_r` is `split_object`, the other is `stable_object`.
  - Check for horizontal alignment:
    - Find an object `M` whose center column `M_c` is between the center columns `A_c` and `B_c` of the other two objects (`A` and `B`).
    - Check if the row range of `M`'s bounding box overlaps with the row ranges of *both* `A` and `B`.
    - If yes, `M` is the mover, movement is horizontal. The object (`A` or `B`) with center column closer to `M_c` is `split_object`, the other is `stable_object`.
  - If no clear alignment is found by center, potential alternative: check alignment by bounding box edges.

split_details:
  - Vertical Mover Movement (Split is Horizontal):
    - Gap covers columns defined by `mover['bbox'][1]` to `mover['bbox'][3]`.
    - Split occurs across these columns.
    - Pixels in `split_object` within these columns are removed.
    - Pixels in `split_object` left of the gap (`c < mover['bbox'][1]`) are shifted left by `ceil(mover['width'] / 2)`.
    - Pixels in `split_object` right of the gap (`c > mover['bbox'][3]`) are shifted right by `ceil(mover['width'] / 2)`.
  - Horizontal Mover Movement (Split is Vertical):
    - Gap covers rows defined by `mover['bbox'][0]` to `mover['bbox'][2]`.
    - Split occurs across these rows.
    - Pixels in `split_object` within these rows are removed.
    - Pixels in `split_object` above the gap (`r < mover['bbox'][0]`) are shifted up by `ceil(mover['height'] / 2)`.
    - Pixels in `split_object` below the gap (`r > mover['bbox'][2]`) are shifted down by `ceil(mover['height'] / 2)`.

grid_construction:
  - Initialize output grid with the background color.
  - Draw the `stable_object` in its original position.
  - Draw the shifted pieces of the `split_object`.
  - Draw the `mover` object in its final position at the grid edge.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the background color (most frequent color).
2.  Find all distinct, contiguous non-background objects and calculate their properties (pixels, bounding box, center, height, width). Ensure exactly three such objects exist.
3.  Determine the roles of the three objects (mover, split\_object, stable\_object) and the axis/direction of movement:
    a.  Check for vertical alignment: Is there one object (potential mover) whose center row is strictly between the center rows of the other two? Do the mover's columns overlap with *both* other objects' columns?
    b.  If vertical alignment found: The middle object is the `mover`. The object (out of the other two) whose center row is closer to the `mover`'s center row is the `split_object`. The remaining object is the `stable_object`. The movement axis is vertical. The direction is 'Up' if `split_object` is above `mover`, 'Down' otherwise.
    c.  If no vertical alignment, check for horizontal alignment: Is there one object (potential mover) whose center column is strictly between the center columns of the other two? Do the mover's rows overlap with *both* other objects' rows?
    d.  If horizontal alignment found: The middle object is the `mover`. The object (out of the other two) whose center column is closer to the `mover`'s center column is the `split_object`. The remaining object is the `stable_object`. The movement axis is horizontal. The direction is 'Left' if `split_object` is left of `mover`, 'Right' otherwise.
    e.  If neither alignment is found, the rule may not apply (or identification logic needs adjustment).
4.  Create a new grid filled with the background color, matching the input dimensions.
5.  Place the `stable_object` onto the new grid at its original location.
6.  Process the `split_object`:
    a.  Determine the gap dimension: `mover`'s width if movement is vertical, `mover`'s height if movement is horizontal.
    b.  Determine the gap location: The column range (`mover`'s min\_col to max\_col) if movement is vertical, or the row range (`mover`'s min\_row to max\_row) if movement is horizontal.
    c.  Calculate the shift amount: `ceil(gap_dimension / 2)`.
    d.  Iterate through each pixel of the `split_object`:
        i.  If movement is vertical:
            *   If the pixel's column is less than the gap's minimum column, shift its column left by the shift amount.
            *   If the pixel's column is greater than the gap's maximum column, shift its column right by the shift amount.
            *   If the pixel's column is within the gap range, discard the pixel.
        ii. If movement is horizontal:
            *   If the pixel's row is less than the gap's minimum row, shift its row up by the shift amount.
            *   If the pixel's row is greater than the gap's maximum row, shift its row down by the shift amount.
            *   If the pixel's row is within the gap range, discard the pixel.
        iii. Draw the potentially shifted pixel onto the new grid if it remains within grid bounds.
7.  Determine the final position of the `mover` object at the grid edge corresponding to the movement direction:
    a.  'Up': Top edge (row 0), maintaining original columns.
    b.  'Down': Bottom edge (row = grid\_height - mover\_height), maintaining original columns.
    c.  'Left': Left edge (column 0), maintaining original rows.
    d.  'Right': Right edge (column = grid\_width - mover\_width), maintaining original rows.
8.  Draw the `mover` object onto the new grid at its calculated final position.
9.  Return the new grid.
