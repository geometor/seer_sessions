            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided Python code attempts to solve the task based on observations from the first example. It correctly identifies the core concept of three objects where one (mover) moves towards another (split_object), causing it to split, while the third (stable_object) remains unchanged, and the mover ends up at the grid edge.\n\nHowever, the code fails on all three examples, indicating fundamental errors in implementing the transformation, specifically:\n\n1.  **Role Identification Error (Example 2):** The logic for determining which object is the 'split\\_object' and which is 'stable\\_object' based on proximity and alignment seems flawed, as it incorrectly assigned roles in Example 2. The 'betweenness' and 'overlap' checks need refinement.\n2.  **Incorrect Splitting Mechanism (All Examples):** The primary issue lies in how the 'split\\_object' is split and shifted.\n    *   The code splits the object *along* the axis of movement and shifts *perpendicularly*.\n    *   The correct logic appears to be: split the object *perpendicular* to the axis of movement, create a gap aligned with the mover's extent along that perpendicular axis, and shift the resulting pieces *along* the axis of movement, away from the gap.\n    *   The amount of shift seems related to `ceil(mover_dimension_perpendicular_to_movement / 2)`.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Refine the conditions for identifying the three object roles (mover, split, stable) by ensuring correct overlap checks relevant to the potential movement axis.\n2.  Correct the splitting logic by:\n    *   Identifying the correct axis for the split (perpendicular to movement).\n    *   Defining the gap based on the mover's projection onto the split object along the perpendicular axis.\n    *   Implementing the shift along the axis of movement.\n3.  Verify the revised logic against all training examples.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze each example systematically. We'll use object properties like color, bounding box (bbox), and center (geometric center of bbox). Background is consistently Orange (7).\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Grid: 10x10\n*   Objects (Input):\n    *   Maroon (9): Pixels={(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,3),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6)}, BBox=(2,3,3,6), Center=(2.5, 4.5), Size=2x4\n    *   Green (3): Pixels={(4,4),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5)}, BBox=(4,4,5,5), Center=(4.5, 4.5), Size=2x2\n    *   Azure (8): Pixels={(6,4),(6,5),(7,4),(7,5),(8,4),(8,5),(9,4),(9,5)}, BBox=(6,4,9,5), Center=(7.5, 4.5), Size=4x2\n*   Alignment: Green is vertically between Maroon and Azure. Green's horizontal span (cols 4-5) overlaps with Maroon's (cols 3-6) and Azure's (cols 4-5).\n*   Proximity: Green (center r=4.5) is closer to Maroon (center r=2.5) than Azure (center r=7.5).\n*   Roles: Mover=Green, Split=Maroon, Stable=Azure. Movement=Up (Vertical). Perpendicular Axis=Horizontal.\n*   Expected Output Objects:\n    *   Green (Mover): At top edge. BBox=(0,4,1,5).\n    *   Maroon (Split): Split vertically, shifted horizontally. Left part: BBox=(2,2,3,3). Right part: BBox=(2,6,3,7). Gap is cols 4-5. Shift = ceil(mover_width/2) = ceil(2/2) = 1.\n    *   Azure (Stable): Unchanged. BBox=(6,4,9,5).\n*   Code Output Analysis (Example 1):\n    *   Mover (Green): Correctly moved to BBox=(0,4,1,5).\n    *   Split (Maroon): Incorrectly split horizontally, shifted vertically. Left part: BBox=(2,3,2,6). Right part: BBox=(4,3,4,6). Gap is row 3. Shift = ceil(mover_width/2)=1. Mistake: Split should be vertical, shift horizontal. Used mover width for shift, but applied it vertically. Split axis wrong.\n    *   Stable (Azure): Correctly unchanged.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Grid: 10x10\n*   Objects (Input):\n    *   Magenta (6): Pixels={(0,3),(0,4),...,(2,5)}, BBox=(0,3,2,6), Center=(1.0, 4.5), Complex Shape\n    *   Blue (1): Pixels={(3,4),(3,5),(4,4),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5)}, BBox=(3,4,5,5), Center=(4.0, 4.5), Size=3x2\n    *   Azure (8): Pixels={(6,2),(6,3),...,(9,7)}, BBox=(6,2,9,7), Center=(7.5, 4.5), Size=4x6\n*   Alignment: Blue is vertically between Magenta and Azure. Blue's horizontal span (cols 4-5) overlaps with Magenta's (cols 3-6) and Azure's (cols 2-7).\n*   Proximity: Blue (center r=4.0) is closer to Azure (center r=7.5) than Magenta (center r=1.0).\n*   Roles: Mover=Blue, Split=Azure, Stable=Magenta. Movement=Down (Vertical). Perpendicular Axis=Horizontal.\n*   Expected Output Objects:\n    *   Blue (Mover): At bottom edge. BBox=(7,4,9,5). Note: Output shows BBox (8,4,10,5) which is out of bounds - maybe it's (7,4,9,5) relative to a 10x10 grid (indices 0-9). Yes, likely (7,4,9,5) for rows 7,8,9.\n    *   Azure (Split): Split vertically, shifted horizontally. Left part: BBox=(6,1,9,3). Right part: BBox=(6,6,9,8). Gap is cols 4-5. Shift = ceil(mover_width/2) = ceil(2/2) = 1.\n    *   Magenta (Stable): Unchanged. BBox=(0,3,2,6).\n*   Code Output Analysis (Example 2):\n    *   Role Mismatch: Code identified Mover=Blue, Split=Magenta, Stable=Azure. This is wrong. It likely compared distances incorrectly or the overlap check was insufficient. Let's re-check `check_overlap`. It checks bbox overlap. Magenta bbox=(0,3,2,6), Blue bbox=(3,4,5,5), Azure bbox=(6,2,9,7). Vertical check: Blue (rows 3-5) is between Magenta (rows 0-2) and Azure (rows 6-9). Horizontal overlap check: Blue (cols 4-5) overlaps Magenta (cols 3-6)? Yes. Blue (cols 4-5) overlaps Azure (cols 2-7)? Yes. Roles should be correct based on proximity: d(Blue,Azure) = |4.0-7.5|=3.5; d(Blue,Magenta) = |4.0-1.0|=3.0. Ah, Magenta is closer! So the roles *should* be Mover=Blue, Split=Magenta, Stable=Azure.\n    *   Code Output (based on Mover=Blue, Split=Magenta, Stable=Azure):\n        *   Mover (Blue): Moved Down? The output shows Blue at (7,4,9,5) which is the *bottom edge*, consistent with moving towards the *original* position of Azure. This contradicts the idea of moving towards the *closer* object (Magenta, which is Up). Let's re-read the prompt description: \"The mover moves towards the closer of the other two objects ... until it reaches the grid edge.\" This implies the *direction* is towards the closer object, and movement continues to the edge. In Ex2, Blue should move *Up* towards Magenta. The expected output shows it moving *Down*. This contradicts the \"closer\" rule.\n        *   Let's reconsider the rule: Maybe it moves towards the closer object *along the axis of alignment*? In Ex2, vertical alignment. Closer is Magenta (Up). Expected output moves Down. This rule doesn't fit.\n        *   Alternative rule: Maybe the 'split' object is the one *not* on the edge along the axis of alignment? Ex1: Maroon/Azure are ends, Green moves towards Maroon (closer). Ex2: Magenta/Azure are ends, Blue moves towards Azure (further). Ex3: Yellow/Red are ends, Blue moves towards Yellow (closer). This isn't consistent either.\n        *   Alternative rule: Maybe direction depends on which side of the grid center the mover is? Ex1: Mover center r=4.5 (upper half of 0-9), moves Up. Ex2: Mover center r=4.0 (upper half), moves Down? Doesn't fit. Ex3: Mover center c=4.5 (left half), moves Left.\n        *   Let's trust the expected output for Ex2: Mover=Blue, Moves Down. Split=Azure, Stable=Magenta. Why move towards Azure if Magenta is closer? Is proximity calculated differently? Edge-to-edge distance? Min distance between pixels? Let's assume the roles from the Expected Output: Mover=Blue, Split=Azure, Stable=Magenta, Direction=Down.\n        *   Code Output based on its (incorrect) roles (Mover=Blue, Split=Magenta, Stable=Azure): It moved Blue Down to (7,4,9,5). It split Magenta horizontally (gap row 4) and shifted vertically by ceil(Blue_width/2)=1. Stable=Azure (unchanged). This is completely wrong compared to expected output.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input Grid: 10x10\n*   Objects (Input):\n    *   Yellow (4): Pixels={(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1)}, BBox=(3,1,6,1), Center=(4.5, 1.0), Size=4x1\n    *   Blue (1): Pixels={(4,6),(4,7),(5,6),(5,7)}, BBox=(4,6,5,7), Center=(4.5, 6.5), Size=2x2\n    *   Red (2): Pixels={(2,9),(3,8),(3,9),...,(7,9)}, BBox=(2,8,7,9), Center=(4.5, 8.5), Complex Shape\n*   Alignment: Blue is horizontally between Yellow and Red. Blue's vertical span (rows 4-5) overlaps with Yellow's (rows 3-6) and Red's (rows 2-7).\n*   Proximity: Blue (center c=6.5) is closer to Yellow (center c=1.0) than Red (center c=8.5).\n*   Roles: Mover=Blue, Split=Yellow, Stable=Red. Movement=Left (Horizontal). Perpendicular Axis=Vertical.\n*   Expected Output Objects:\n    *   Blue (Mover): At left edge. BBox=(4,0,5,1).\n    *   Yellow (Split): Split horizontally, shifted vertically. Top part: BBox=(2,1,3,1). Bottom part: BBox=(6,1,7,1). Gap is rows 4-5. Shift = ceil(mover_height/2) = ceil(2/2) = 1.\n    *   Red (Stable): Unchanged. BBox=(2,8,7,9).\n*   Code Output Analysis (Example 3):\n    *   Mover (Blue): Correctly moved to BBox=(4,0,5,1).\n    *   Split (Yellow): Incorrectly split vertically, shifted horizontally. Top part: BBox=(3,0,6,0). Bottom part: BBox=(3,2,6,2). Gap is col 1. Shift = ceil(mover_height/2)=1. Mistake: Split should be horizontal, shift vertical. Used mover height for shift, but applied it horizontally. Split axis wrong.\n    *   Stable (Red): Correctly unchanged.\n\n**Revised Understanding Post-Metrics:**\n1.  **Role Identification:** The 'closer' rule seems problematic given Example 2's expected output. If we *assume* the expected output implies the roles (Mover=Blue, Split=Azure, Stable=Magenta in Ex2), then proximity isn't the sole determinant. What else differentiates Azure and Magenta? Azure is larger. Azure is a simple rectangle, Magenta is complex. The alignment axis is vertical. Perhaps the object that *spans further* along the perpendicular axis (horizontal) is the stable one? Magenta spans cols 3-6 (width 4). Azure spans cols 2-7 (width 6). Azure spans further horizontally, so it should be stable? No, that makes Azure stable, but expected output says Azure is split.\n    Let's reconsider the alignment/overlap check. `check_overlap` uses bounding boxes. Maybe pixel-level overlap is needed? Unlikely to change Ex2.\n    What if the rule is simply: Mover is between the other two along an axis (H or V) and overlaps with both along the perpendicular axis. One of the other two is split, one is stable. The mover moves *towards the split object* until the edge. How to identify split vs stable?\n    *   Ex1: Mover=G, Ends=M,A. G moves Up towards M. Split=M. Stable=A.\n    *   Ex2: Mover=B, Ends=M,A. B moves Down towards A. Split=A. Stable=M.\n    *   Ex3: Mover=B, Ends=Y,R. B moves Left towards Y. Split=Y. Stable=R.\n    It seems the **split object is the one the mover moves towards**. How is the direction determined? It is *not* always the closer object. It *could* be related to the grid structure (e.g., move away from center? move towards grid side with more space?). Or maybe related to object properties?\n    Let's re-examine distances in Ex2: Mover Blue (4.0, 4.5). Magenta (1.0, 4.5). Azure (7.5, 4.5). Distances: d(B,M)=3.0, d(B,A)=3.5. Closer is M. Movement is Down towards A. Why? Could the 'center' calculation be misleading for complex shapes like Magenta? If we use min/max row: Magenta(0-2), Blue(3-5), Azure(6-9). Blue is exactly between.\n    Is there an input/output consistency? In Ex1, mover moves away from larger object (Azure > Maroon). In Ex2, mover moves towards larger object (Azure > Magenta). In Ex3, mover moves towards larger object (Yellow > Red - area wise? Yellow=4 pixels, Red=8 pixels. No). Size based on bbox? Yellow(4x1), Red(6x2). Moves towards Yellow (smaller bbox area, smaller width, larger height). This is getting confusing.\n    Let's stick to the simplest interpretation that fits the output: Mover is between A and B, overlaps both perpendicularly. Mover moves towards one of them (Split object) to the edge. The other is Stable. The direction/choice of Split object needs a better hypothesis, but for now, we can deduce it from the expected output.\n2.  **Splitting Mechanism:** The analysis confirms the previous assessment:\n    *   Split Axis: Perpendicular to Movement Axis.\n    *   Gap Location: Corresponds to Mover's span along the Perpendicular Axis.\n    *   Shift Axis: Parallel to Movement Axis.\n    *   Shift Amount: `ceil(Mover_Dimension_Along_Perpendicular_Axis / 2)`.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Check if one object (potential `mover`) is positioned strictly between the other two objects (`A` and `B`) along the vertical axis. Also, verify that the `mover`'s horizontal span (min\\_col to max\\_col) overlaps with `A`'s horizontal span AND `B`'s horizontal span.

If neither alignment is found, the rule does not apply.\n    d.  Identify which of the two end objects (`A` or `B`) is the `split_object` and which is the `stable_object`. The `mover` moves along the `Movement Axis` towards the `split_object`. (The specific rule to determine which object is the `split_object` is unclear from proximity alone and needs further hypothesis/testing, but can be inferred from the examples: Ex1->move Up, Ex2->move Down, Ex3->move Left). Let the direction towards the `split_object` be the `Movement Direction`. The `Perpendicular Axis` is the axis orthogonal to the `Movement Axis`.\n3.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.\n4.  **Place Stable Object:** Copy the `stable_object`'s pixels to the output grid at their original locations.\n5.  **Process Split Object:**\n    a.  Determine the `mover`'s dimension along the `Perpendicular Axis` (height if movement is Horizontal, width if movement is Vertical). Let this be `gap_extent`.\n    b.  Calculate the shift amount: `shift = ceil(gap_extent / 2)`.\n    c.  Determine the range of indices covered by the `mover`'s bounding box along the `Perpendicular Axis`. Let this be `gap_range` (e.g., if movement is Vertical, `gap_range` is the set of column indices from `mover_min_col` to `mover_max_col`).\n    d.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the `split_object`:\n        i.  If the `Movement Axis` is Vertical: Check the pixel's column `c`. If `c` is less than the minimum of `gap_range`, the new column is `nc = c - shift`. If `c` is greater than the maximum of `gap_range`, the new column is `nc = c + shift`. If `c` is within `gap_range`, discard the pixel. The row `nr = r` remains unchanged.\n        ii. If the `Movement Axis` is Horizontal: Check the pixel's row `r`.
