In each example, for any given color other than white, there appear to be exactly two pixels of that color.\n*   **Output Grids:** The output grids contain solid rectangles filled with the colors found in the input grid. The background remains white.\n*   **Relationship:** The positions of the colored pixels in the input grid define the boundaries of the filled rectangles in the output grid. Specifically, for each color present in the input, the two pixels of that color seem to define the diagonally opposite corners of a rectangle filled with that same color in the output. The rectangle encompasses all cells between the minimum and maximum row and column coordinates defined by those two input pixels.\n\n**Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
