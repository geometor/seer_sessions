task_description: "Generate filled rectangles based on pairs of same-colored pixels in the input."
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains_pixels: True
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
  - type: object (derived)
    description: "Pair of pixels of the same non-white color in the input grid."
    properties:
      - color: Non-white color (1-9)
      - pixel_1_position: (r1, c1)
      - pixel_2_position: (r2, c2)
  - type: object (output)
    description: "Filled rectangle in the output grid."
    properties:
      - color: Same as the pair of input pixels defining it.
      - top_left_corner: (min(r1, r2), min(c1, c2))
      - bottom_right_corner: (max(r1, r2), max(c1, c2))
      - filled: True
relationships:
  - description: "Each pair of same-colored non-white pixels in the input defines the boundaries of a solid rectangle of that same color in the output."
    source: Pair of input pixels
    target: Output rectangle
    rule: "The rectangle spans inclusively from the minimum row and column to the maximum row and column defined by the pair of input pixel positions."
actions:
  - action: find_pixel_pairs
    description: "Identify pairs of pixels with the same non-white color in the input grid."
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list_of_pixel_pairs [(color, pos1, pos2), ...]
  - action: define_rectangle_bounds
    description: "For each pair, determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices."
    inputs: pixel_pair (color, pos1, pos2)
    outputs: rectangle_definition (color, min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)
  - action: draw_rectangle
    description: "Fill the area defined by the bounds with the specified color on an initially white output grid."
    inputs: output_grid, rectangle_definition
    outputs: modified_output_grid
grid_properties:
  - size_relation: output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - background: output grid is initialized to white (0).
