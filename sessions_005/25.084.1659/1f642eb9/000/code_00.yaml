task_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      size: 10x10
      background_color: 'white' (0)
  - type: object
    id: central_block
    description: A contiguous block of 'azure' (8) pixels, varying in size and position slightly near the center.
    role: target_area
  - type: object_set
    id: projector_pixels
    description: Isolated single pixels of various colors (not 'white' and not 'azure').
    location: Scattered, often near edges, outside the central_block.
    role: source_colors
relationship:
  - type: projection
    source: projector_pixels
    target: central_block
    condition: Orthogonal projection (horizontal or vertical) from a projector_pixel through only 'white' (0) pixels.
    effect: The first 'azure' (8) pixel encountered on the projection path within the central_block changes its color to match the source projector_pixel's color.
    persistence: Source projector_pixels and unaffected 'azure' pixels remain unchanged.
