            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are 10x10.\n2.  **Background Color:** The predominant background color is 'white' (0).\n3.  **Central Object:** Each input grid features a central, contiguous block of 'azure' (8) pixels. The shape and size of this block vary between examples (3x5, 4x2, 5x3).\n4.  **Scattered Pixels:** Outside the 'azure' block, there are several isolated, single pixels of various colors (non-'white', non-'azure'). These pixels are often located near the edges or corners of the grid.\n5.  **Transformation:** The output grid is mostly identical to the input grid. The key difference is that some specific pixels within the central 'azure' block have their color changed.\n6.  **Color Source:** The new colors appearing within the 'azure' block in the output correspond exactly to the colors of the scattered pixels found in the input grid.\n7.  **Mechanism:** It appears that each scattered, non-'azure', non-'white' pixel \"projects\" its color onto the 'azure' block. The projection follows a straight horizontal or vertical line from the scattered pixel towards the 'azure' block. The path of projection seems to travel only through 'white' pixels. The first 'azure' pixel encountered along this path has its color changed to match the scattered pixel's color.\n8.  **Persistence:** The original scattered pixels remain unchanged in their positions in the output grid. The 'azure' pixels that are not hit by any projection also remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
