"""
This module transforms an input grid based on a single non-white pixel.

1. Identify the single non-white pixel in the input grid. Let its color be C
   and its column index be X.
2. Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid,
   initially filled with white (0).
3. Iterate through the columns j from X to the last column index (width - 1).
4. Calculate the offset = j - X.
5. If offset is an even number (0, 2, 4, ...):
   - Fill the entire column j of the output grid with color C.
6. If offset is an odd number (1, 3, 5, ...):
   - Check the position for the gray pixel based on the offset:
     - If (offset // 2) is an even number (meaning offset is 1, 5, 9, ...),
       set the pixel at row 0 and column j to gray (5).
     - If (offset // 2) is an odd number (meaning offset is 3, 7, 11, ...),
       set the pixel at the last row (height - 1) and column j to gray (5).
