Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The inputs are rectangular grids of varying sizes. The outputs are also rectangular grids, generally smaller than the inputs.
2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved seem to be red (2) and white (0) which appear in both inputs and outputs. Blue (1) and azure (8) appear only in the inputs and seem to play a special role. Other colors might appear but these four are consistent across examples.
3.  **Key Colors (Markers):** Blue (1) and Azure (8) pixels appear in the input grids but never in the output grids. Their positions seem crucial. In several examples (2, 3, 4, 5), blue and azure pixels appear paired within the same row.
4.  **Transformation:** The output grids seem to be constructed by extracting specific horizontal slices (segments) from the input grids. The content of these slices (red and white pixels) is preserved.
5.  **Extraction Logic:** Examining examples where blue (1) and azure (8) appear in the same row (e.g., Example 2, row 2), the output corresponds exactly to the pixels *between* the blue and azure pixels in that row.
6.  **Multiple Occurrences:** In examples with multiple rows containing blue/azure pairs (e.g., Example 1, 3, 4, 5), multiple segments are extracted.
7.  **Output Assembly:** The extracted horizontal segments appear to be stacked vertically in the output grid, maintaining the relative vertical order they had in the input grid. The width of the output grid is determined by the length of these extracted segments (which appears consistent within a single task example).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty list called `extracted_segments`.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from top to bottom (row index `r`).
3.  For each row `r`:
    a.  Find the column index (`blue_col`) of the first blue pixel (1), if it exists in this row.
    b.  Find the column index (`azure_col`) of the first azure pixel (8), if it exists in this row.
    c.  If both a blue pixel and an azure pixel were found in row `r`:
        i.  Determine the starting column for extraction: `start_col = min(blue_col, azure_col) + 1`.
        ii. Determine the ending column for extraction (exclusive): `end_col = max(blue_col, azure_col)`.
        iii. If `start_col < end_col`, extract the slice of row `r` from `start_col` up to (but not including) `end_col`.
        iv. Append this extracted slice to the `extracted_segments` list.
4.  Construct the output grid by vertically stacking the segments in the `extracted_segments` list, maintaining their order.
5.  If `extracted_segments` is empty, the output is an empty grid (or handle as appropriate for the framework, e.g., a 0x0 grid).
