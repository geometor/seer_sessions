*   **Perception**
    *   The input grids contain a white background (color 0) and multiple disconnected objects composed of azure pixels (color 8).
    *   The azure objects vary in shape and position across the different examples.
    *   The output grid is always a square grid, smaller than the input grid.
    *   The output grid contains a white background (color 0) and a single diagonal line of azure pixels (color 8) starting from the top-left corner and extending to the bottom-right corner.
    *   The size of the output grid appears to be related to the number of distinct azure objects present in the input grid. Specifically, if there are `N` azure objects in the input, the output grid is `N`x`N`.

        properties:
          - composed of one or more contiguous pixels
          - contiguity includes adjacent pixels (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally)
          - multiple disconnected objects can exist

      - action: draw_diagonal
        input: N x N white grid
        parameters:
          - color: azure (8)
          - start: top-left (0, 0)
          - end: bottom-right (N-1, N-1)
        output: final output grid
    relationship:
      - The dimension N of the output grid is equal to the count of distinct azure objects found in the input grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**
    1.  Identify all distinct groups of connected azure (8) pixels in the input grid. Consider pixels connected if they touch horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Each such group constitutes a single object.
    2.  Count the total number of these distinct azure objects. Let this count be `N`.
    3.  Create a new square grid of size `N` by `N`.
    4.  Initialize all pixels in the new grid with the background color white (0).
    5.  Iterate from `i = 0` to `N-1`. In each iteration, set the color of the pixel at row `i` and column `i` (the main diagonal) to azure (8).
    6.  The resulting `N`x`N` grid is the output.
