task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D array of integers 0-9 representing colors.
  background_color: 7 (orange)
  foreground_colors:
    - 6 (magenta) in examples 1, 2
    - 8 (azure) in example 3
  output_color_added: 2 (red)
transformation_elements:
  - element_type: background_pixel
    color: 7 (orange)
    action: Conditional change to 2 (red).
    condition: The pixel is part of at least one 2x2 square in the input grid that contains exactly one non-background pixel (color != 7) and three background pixels (color == 7).
  - element_type: foreground_pixel
    color: Any color != 7
    action: No change. Retains original color in the output.
  - element_type: background_pixel
    color: 7 (orange)
    action: No change. Retains original color in the output.
    condition: The pixel does not meet the condition for changing to red (2).
relationships:
  - The placement of the new red (2) pixels depends on the local 2x2 neighborhood configuration around each background pixel in the input grid, specifically the count of foreground vs. background pixels within those 2x2 squares.
