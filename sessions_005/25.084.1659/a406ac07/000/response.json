The output grids retain these last row/column pixels but add new colored structures within the main 9x9 area.\n4.  **Last Row/Column Relationship:** In the input grids, the sequence of colors in the last row (read left-to-right) is identical to the sequence of colors in the last column (read top-to-bottom) in examples 1 and 2. In example 3, there's a slight difference (two 8s vs three 8s, three 4s vs two 4s), suggesting the transformation might primarily depend on one of them (likely the last row based on the output structure).\n5.  **Output Structures:** The output grids feature solid squares of color placed along the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).\n6.  **Square Properties:**\n    *   The *color* of each square corresponds to a color found in the last row/column of the input.\n    *   The *size* of each square corresponds to the number of contiguous occurrences of that color in the last row of the input.\n    *   The *position* (top-left corner) of each square (row `r`, column `c`) seems to be determined by the starting index `idx` of the corresponding color sequence in the last row, such that `r = idx` and `c = idx`.\n7.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves reading the contiguous color blocks in the last row of the input and using their color, length, and starting position to draw corresponding squares on the main diagonal of the output grid. The last row and column from the input are preserved in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
