task_context:
  grid_size: [10, 10] # All examples are 10x10
  background_color: 0 # white
  input_features:
    - border_elements:
        location: [last_row, last_column]
        description: Contain sequences of non-background colors. The sequence in the last row dictates the transformation.
  output_features:
    - border_elements:
        location: [last_row, last_column]
        source: Copied directly from the input grid.
    - generated_objects:
        type: solid_squares
        placement: Along the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).
        properties:
          color: Determined by the color of a contiguous block in the input's last row.
          size: Determined by the length (count) of the corresponding contiguous block in the input's last row.
          position: The top-left corner (row `r`, col `c`) is placed at `r = idx`, `c = idx`, where `idx` is the starting column index of the corresponding block in the input's last row.
transformation_rule:
  steps:
    - Identify contiguous blocks of non-background colors in the last row of the input grid.
    - For each block: record its color (C), starting index (idx), and length (n).
    - Create an output grid of the same size, initialized with the background color.
    - Copy the last row and last column from the input to the output.
    - For each identified block (C, idx, n), draw an n x n square of color C in the output grid, with its top-left corner at (idx, idx).
