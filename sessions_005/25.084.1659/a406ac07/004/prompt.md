"""
This program transforms an input grid based on patterns found in its last row.

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (0, white).
2.  Copy the last row and the last column from the input grid to the corresponding positions in the output grid. This acts as a border or frame.
3.  Analyze the last row of the input grid (excluding the bottom-right corner pixel which belongs to both borders) to identify contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of identical, non-background colors.
4.  For each identified segment:
    a.  Record its color (C).
    b.  Record its length (n).
    c.  Record the starting column index (idx) of the segment.
    d.  Determine the drawing area for a square based on this segment:
        i.  Top row: `row_start = idx`
        ii. Bottom row (exclusive): `row_end = min(idx + n, height - 1)` (Clip to not overwrite the last row border)
        iii.Left column: `col_start = idx`
        iv. Right column (exclusive): `col_end = min(idx + n, width - 1)` (Clip to not overwrite the last column border)
    e.  If the calculated drawing area has valid dimensions (`row_start < row_end` and `col_start < col_end`), fill this rectangular area `output_grid[row_start : row_end, col_start : col_end]` with the color C. Note that this might not be a perfect square if clipped by the boundaries.
5.  Re-copy the last row and the last column from the input grid to the output grid. This ensures that the border pixels retain their original input values, even if the drawing process in step 4 overwrote them.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
