            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code successfully implemented the logic derived from the first example, where segments in the last row defined square shapes. However, Example 3 revealed that this assumption was incomplete. The failure occurred because the shapes drawn are not always squares, and their dimensions and positions depend on information from both the last row and the last column.\n\nSpecifically, the width of the drawn rectangle corresponds to the length of the segment in the last row, while the height corresponds to the length of the segment of the *same color* in the last column. The top-left corner's coordinates are determined by the starting indices of these corresponding row and column segments.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Identify non-background color segments in the last row (excluding the last pixel).\n2.  Identify non-background color segments in the last column (excluding the last pixel).\n3.  Match segments from the row and column based on their color.\n4.  Use the start index and length of the row segment to define the rectangle's column position and width.\n5.  Use the start index and length of the corresponding column segment to define the rectangle's row position and height.\n6.  Draw the rectangle with the matched color.\n7.  Ensure the last row and column borders are preserved from the input.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze the segments in the last row and last column for each example.\nSegments are defined by (Color, Start Index, Length).\nWe exclude the bottom-right corner pixel from both row and column analysis.\n\n"
