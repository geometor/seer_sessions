"""
This program transforms an input grid based on patterns found in its last row.

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (0, white).
2.  Copy the last row and the last column from the input grid to the corresponding positions in the output grid.
3.  Analyze the last row of the input grid to identify contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of identical, non-background colors.
4.  For each identified segment:
    a.  Record its color (C).
    b.  Record its length (n).
    c.  Record the starting column index (idx) of the segment.
    d.  In the output grid, draw a solid square of size n x n using color C, with its top-left corner positioned at (row=idx, column=idx).
5.  Return the modified output grid.
