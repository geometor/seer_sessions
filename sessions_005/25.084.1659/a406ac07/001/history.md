Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 10x10 grids.
2.  **Background:** The primary background color is white (0).
3.  **Key Areas:** The input grids have colored pixels concentrated in the last row and the last column. The output grids retain these last row/column pixels but add new colored structures within the main 9x9 area.
4.  **Last Row/Column Relationship:** In the input grids, the sequence of colors in the last row (read left-to-right) is identical to the sequence of colors in the last column (read top-to-bottom) in examples 1 and 2. In example 3, there's a slight difference (two 8s vs three 8s, three 4s vs two 4s), suggesting the transformation might primarily depend on one of them (likely the last row based on the output structure).
5.  **Output Structures:** The output grids feature solid squares of color placed along the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).
6.  **Square Properties:**
    *   The *color* of each square corresponds to a color found in the last row/column of the input.
    *   The *size* of each square corresponds to the number of contiguous occurrences of that color in the last row of the input.
    *   The *position* (top-left corner) of each square (row `r`, column `c`) seems to be determined by the starting index `idx` of the corresponding color sequence in the last row, such that `r = idx` and `c = idx`.
7.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves reading the contiguous color blocks in the last row of the input and using their color, length, and starting position to draw corresponding squares on the main diagonal of the output grid. The last row and column from the input are preserved in the output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_size: [10, 10] # All examples are 10x10
  background_color: 0 # white
  input_features:
    - border_elements:
        location: [last_row, last_column]
        description: Contain sequences of non-background colors. The sequence in the last row dictates the transformation.
  output_features:
    - border_elements:
        location: [last_row, last_column]
        source: Copied directly from the input grid.
    - generated_objects:
        type: solid_squares
        placement: Along the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).
        properties:
          color: Determined by the color of a contiguous block in the input's last row.
          size: Determined by the length (count) of the corresponding contiguous block in the input's last row.
          position: The top-left corner (row `r`, col `c`) is placed at `r = idx`, `c = idx`, where `idx` is the starting column index of the corresponding block in the input's last row.
transformation_rule:
  steps:
    - Identify contiguous blocks of non-background colors in the last row of the input grid.
    - For each block: record its color (C), starting index (idx), and length (n).
    - Create an output grid of the same size, initialized with the background color.
    - Copy the last row and last column from the input to the output.
    - For each identified block (C, idx, n), draw an n x n square of color C in the output grid, with its top-left corner at (idx, idx).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Copy the entire last row from the input grid to the last row of the output grid.
3.  Copy the entire last column from the input grid to the last column of the output grid.
4.  Analyze the last row of the *input* grid to identify contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of identical, non-background colors.
5.  For each identified segment:
    a.  Determine its color (let's call it `C`).
    b.  Determine its length (number of pixels, let's call it `n`).
    c.  Determine the column index of its starting pixel (the leftmost pixel of the segment, let's call it `idx`).
    d.  In the *output* grid, fill a square region of size `n x n` with the color `C`. The top-left corner of this square region should be at the coordinate (row=`idx`, column=`idx`).
6.  The resulting grid is the final output.
