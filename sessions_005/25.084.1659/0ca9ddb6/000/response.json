The output grids retain all the original colored pixels in their original positions. Additionally, new pixels appear in the output grid: yellow (4) and orange (7).\n\nThe appearance of the new pixels seems related to the positions of the red (2) and blue (1) pixels in the input grid.\n\n*   **Yellow (4) pixels:** Appear diagonally adjacent to the red (2) pixels. Specifically, they form the corners of a 3x3 square centered on each red pixel, provided those corner positions are within the grid bounds and were originally white.\n*   **Orange (7) pixels:** Appear orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the blue (1) pixels. Specifically, they form a plus shape centered on each blue pixel, provided those adjacent positions are within the grid bounds and were originally white.\n\nPixels of other colors (azure - 8, magenta - 6) do not seem to influence the output or change themselves. The white (0) background pixels are only changed if they become yellow or orange according to the rules above.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

However, based on the examples, orthogonal neighbors of blue and diagonal neighbors of red don't seem to overlap in a way that causes conflict. The initial copy ensures original pixels aren't overwritten incorrectly).
