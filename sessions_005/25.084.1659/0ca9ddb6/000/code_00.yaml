elements:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  - type: pixel
    color: red (2)
    role: source
    action: Creates yellow (4) pixels at diagonal adjacent positions.
  - type: pixel
    color: blue (1)
    role: source
    action: Creates orange (7) pixels at orthogonal adjacent positions.
  - type: pixel
    color: yellow (4)
    role: generated
    relationship: Diagonally adjacent to red (2) pixels.
  - type: pixel
    color: orange (7)
    role: generated
    relationship: Orthogonally adjacent to blue (1) pixels.
  - type: pixel
    colors: [azure (8), magenta (6)]
    role: static
    description: These pixels remain unchanged in the output.
  - type: pixel
    color: white (0)
    role: background
    action: Can be overwritten by generated yellow (4) or orange (7) pixels. Otherwise remains white.

constraints:
  - Generated pixels (yellow and orange) only appear if the target position is within the grid boundaries.
  - Generated pixels only overwrite white (0) pixels. Original non-white pixels are preserved.

transformation:
  - Identify all red (2) pixels in the input grid.
  - For each red pixel, find its diagonal neighbors (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).
  - If a diagonal neighbor is within the grid bounds and is currently white (0), change its color to yellow (4).
  - Identify all blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
  - For each blue pixel, find its orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right).
  - If an orthogonal neighbor is within the grid bounds and is currently white (0), change its color to orange (7).
  - Preserve all original non-white pixels from the input grid.
