If a diagonal neighbor is within the grid bounds and is currently white (0) in the *input* grid, change the color of that corresponding cell in the *output* grid to yellow (4).\n3. Identify all blue (1) pixels in the input grid. For each blue pixel, find its orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right). If an orthogonal neighbor is within the grid bounds and is currently white (0) in the *input* grid, change the color of that corresponding cell in the *output* grid to orange (7).\n4.
