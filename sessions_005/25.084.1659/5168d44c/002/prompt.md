"""
Identifies a 3x3 'Red Cross' object (red border, green center) and other isolated 'Green Dots' in the input grid. 
Calculates the average position of the Green Dots relative to the Red Cross center.
Determines a movement direction (Up, Down, Left, Right) based on the larger absolute difference between the average dot position and the cross center (row or column).
Moves the Red Cross object 2 steps if the movement is vertical (Up/Down) or 1 step if the movement is horizontal (Left/Right) in the determined direction. 
The original position of the Red Cross is filled with white pixels. Green Dots remain stationary. If no Green Dots are found or no Red Cross is found, the grid remains unchanged.
