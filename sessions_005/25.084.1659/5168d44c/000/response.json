The Green Dots appear to remain stationary. The background (white pixels) adjusts to accommodate the movement of the Red Cross Object (the original location becomes white).\n4.  **Movement Logic:** The direction and distance of the Red Cross Object's movement seem related to the positions of the Green Dots relative to the Red Cross Object's initial position.\n    *   In `train_1`, the green dots are predominantly below the cross (average row is lower). The cross moves down by 2 steps.\n    *   In `train_2`, the green dots are predominantly to the right of the cross (average column is higher). The cross moves right by 1 step.\n    *   In `train_3`, the green dots are predominantly below the cross (average row is lower). The cross moves down by 2 steps.\n5.  **Inferred Rule:** The Red Cross Object calculates the average position of all *other* Green Dots. It determines the primary axis (vertical or horizontal) along which the Green Dots are most displaced from the Red Cross Object's center. The object then moves along that axis: 2 steps if the primary axis is vertical (Up/Down), and 1 step if the primary axis is horizontal (Left/Right).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
