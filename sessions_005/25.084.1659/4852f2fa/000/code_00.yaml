task_description: Extracts an azure pattern, adjusts its height to 3 (padding with white above if necessary), and tiles each row horizontally based on the count of yellow pixels.

elements:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
  - element: pattern_pixels
    color: azure (8)
    property: form a single contiguous object in the input.
  - element: counter_pixels
    color: yellow (4)
    property: appear as isolated pixels in the input.

transformations:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify the azure object.
    input: input grid
    output: azure object pixels coordinates.
  - step: 2
    action: Calculate the bounding box of the azure object.
    input: azure object pixels coordinates
    output: bounding box coordinates (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
  - step: 3
    action: Extract the subgrid corresponding to the bounding box.
    input: input grid, bounding box coordinates
    output: extracted pattern (a grid).
  - step: 4
    action: Count the number of yellow pixels in the input grid.
    input: input grid
    output: count (N).
  - step: 5
    action: Adjust the height of the extracted pattern to 3.
    input: extracted pattern
    output: adjusted pattern (height 3).
    details:
      - If height < 3, add (3 - height) rows of white pixels at the top.
      - If height > 3, take only the top 3 rows.
      - If height == 3, use as is.
  - step: 6
    action: Determine the output grid dimensions.
    input: adjusted pattern, count (N)
    output: output height (H=3), output width (W = adjusted_pattern_width * N).
  - step: 7
    action: Create the output grid.
    input: adjusted pattern, count (N), output dimensions (H, W)
    output: final output grid.
    details:
      - For each row R (from 0 to H-1) in the adjusted pattern:
        - Repeat row R horizontally N times.
        - Place the resulting row into row R of the output grid.

relationships:
  - The number of yellow pixels determines the horizontal repetition factor for the azure pattern rows.
  - The output grid's structure is based on tiling the rows of the (height-adjusted) bounding box of the input azure object.
  - The output grid height is fixed at 3.
