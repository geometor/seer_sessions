            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Contents:** The input grids contain a background of white pixels (0), a single contiguous object composed of azure pixels (8), and one or more isolated yellow pixels (4).\n2.  **Output Grid Contents:** The output grids contain only white (0) and azure (8) pixels. The yellow pixels are absent.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve extracting the azure object, potentially modifying it based on its dimensions, and then repeating it horizontally. The number of repetitions appears to be determined by the count of yellow pixels in the input.\n4.  **Azure Object Extraction:** The core azure pattern in the output seems to be derived from the bounding box of the azure object in the input.\n5.  **Yellow Pixel Role:** The yellow pixels act as counters, determining how many times the extracted (and potentially modified) azure pattern's rows are tiled horizontally.\n6.  **Output Dimensions:** The output grid's width is the width of the extracted azure bounding box multiplied by the number of yellow pixels. The output grid's height appears to be consistently 3.\n7.  **Height Adjustment:** If the extracted azure bounding box has a height less than 3, it seems to be padded with rows of white pixels *at the top* to reach a height of 3 before tiling. If the height is 3 or more, only the top 3 rows are used (though no example shows a height greater than 3).\n8.  **Tiling Mechanism:** The tiling happens row by row. Each row of the height-adjusted azure pattern is repeated horizontally the required number of times (based on the yellow pixel count) to form the corresponding row in the output grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
