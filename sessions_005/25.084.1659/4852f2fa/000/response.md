Okay, let's analyze the task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input Grid Contents:** The input grids contain a background of white pixels (0), a single contiguous object composed of azure pixels (8), and one or more isolated yellow pixels (4).
2.  **Output Grid Contents:** The output grids contain only white (0) and azure (8) pixels. The yellow pixels are absent.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve extracting the azure object, potentially modifying it based on its dimensions, and then repeating it horizontally. The number of repetitions appears to be determined by the count of yellow pixels in the input.
4.  **Azure Object Extraction:** The core azure pattern in the output seems to be derived from the bounding box of the azure object in the input.
5.  **Yellow Pixel Role:** The yellow pixels act as counters, determining how many times the extracted (and potentially modified) azure pattern's rows are tiled horizontally.
6.  **Output Dimensions:** The output grid's width is the width of the extracted azure bounding box multiplied by the number of yellow pixels. The output grid's height appears to be consistently 3.
7.  **Height Adjustment:** If the extracted azure bounding box has a height less than 3, it seems to be padded with rows of white pixels *at the top* to reach a height of 3 before tiling. If the height is 3 or more, only the top 3 rows are used (though no example shows a height greater than 3).
8.  **Tiling Mechanism:** The tiling happens row by row. Each row of the height-adjusted azure pattern is repeated horizontally the required number of times (based on the yellow pixel count) to form the corresponding row in the output grid.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Extracts an azure pattern, adjusts its height to 3 (padding with white above if necessary), and tiles each row horizontally based on the count of yellow pixels.

elements:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
  - element: pattern_pixels
    color: azure (8)
    property: form a single contiguous object in the input.
  - element: counter_pixels
    color: yellow (4)
    property: appear as isolated pixels in the input.

transformations:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify the azure object.
    input: input grid
    output: azure object pixels coordinates.
  - step: 2
    action: Calculate the bounding box of the azure object.
    input: azure object pixels coordinates
    output: bounding box coordinates (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
  - step: 3
    action: Extract the subgrid corresponding to the bounding box.
    input: input grid, bounding box coordinates
    output: extracted pattern (a grid).
  - step: 4
    action: Count the number of yellow pixels in the input grid.
    input: input grid
    output: count (N).
  - step: 5
    action: Adjust the height of the extracted pattern to 3.
    input: extracted pattern
    output: adjusted pattern (height 3).
    details:
      - If height < 3, add (3 - height) rows of white pixels at the top.
      - If height > 3, take only the top 3 rows.
      - If height == 3, use as is.
  - step: 6
    action: Determine the output grid dimensions.
    input: adjusted pattern, count (N)
    output: output height (H=3), output width (W = adjusted_pattern_width * N).
  - step: 7
    action: Create the output grid.
    input: adjusted pattern, count (N), output dimensions (H, W)
    output: final output grid.
    details:
      - For each row R (from 0 to H-1) in the adjusted pattern:
        - Repeat row R horizontally N times.
        - Place the resulting row into row R of the output grid.

relationships:
  - The number of yellow pixels determines the horizontal repetition factor for the azure pattern rows.
  - The output grid's structure is based on tiling the rows of the (height-adjusted) bounding box of the input azure object.
  - The output grid height is fixed at 3.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Find the single contiguous object made of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  Determine the smallest rectangular bounding box that encloses this azure object.
3.  Extract the subgrid defined by this bounding box; this is the base `pattern`.
4.  Count the total number of yellow (4) pixels present anywhere in the input grid; let this count be `N`.
5.  Create a `modified_pattern` grid with the same width as the `pattern` but with a height of exactly 3.
6.  If the height of the `pattern` is less than 3, fill the top `(3 - pattern_height)` rows of the `modified_pattern` with white (0) and copy the `pattern` into the remaining bottom rows.
7.  If the height of the `pattern` is 3 or greater, copy the top 3 rows of the `pattern` into the `modified_pattern`.
8.  Calculate the `output_width` as `pattern_width * N`. The `output_height` is 3.
9.  Create a new output grid of size `output_height` by `output_width`, initially filled with white (0).
10. For each row `r` (from 0 to 2) in the `modified_pattern`:
    a.  Take the `r`-th row of the `modified_pattern`.
    b.  Concatenate this row with itself `N` times horizontally.
    c.  Place this concatenated row into the `r`-th row of the output grid.
11. The resulting grid is the final output.
