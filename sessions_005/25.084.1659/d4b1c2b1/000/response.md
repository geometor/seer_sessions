**Perception**

The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid. By observing the examples, I notice the following:

1.  **Scaling Transformation:** In most examples (`train_1`, `train_4`, `train_5`, `train_6`, `train_7`), the output grid is a scaled-up version of the input grid. Each pixel (color) in the input grid is replaced by a square block of the same color in the output grid.
2.  **Variable Scaling Factor:** The size of the block (and thus the overall scaling factor) varies between examples.
    *   `train_1`: 3x3 -> 9x9 (3x scaling, each pixel becomes a 3x3 block).
    *   `train_4`: 3x3 -> 12x12 (4x scaling, each pixel becomes a 4x4 block).
    *   `train_5`, `train_6`, `train_7`: 3x3 -> 6x6 (2x scaling, each pixel becomes a 2x2 block).
3.  **Determining the Scaling Factor:** The scaling factor appears to be directly determined by the *number of unique colors* present in the input grid.
    *   `train_1`: 3 unique colors (yellow, orange, azure) -> 3x scaling.
    *   `train_4`: 4 unique colors (yellow, red, gray, azure) -> 4x scaling.
    *   `train_5`: 2 unique colors (red, yellow) -> 2x scaling.
    *   `train_6`: 2 unique colors (blue, magenta) -> 2x scaling.
    *   `train_7`: 2 unique colors (green, magenta) -> 2x scaling.
4.  **Monochromatic Exception:** Examples `train_2` and `train_3` have input grids containing only a single color. In these cases, the output grid is identical to the input grid. This aligns with the scaling rule: if there is 1 unique color, the scaling factor is 1x, resulting in no change.

        Initialize output_grid with dimensions (input_height * scaling_factor) x (input_width * scaling_factor).
        For each pixel at (row, col) with color C in the input_grid:
          Fill the corresponding block of size scaling_factor x scaling_factor in the output_grid,
          starting at (row * scaling_factor, col * scaling_factor), with color C.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Analyze the input grid to identify all the unique color values present.
2.  Count the total number of unique color values found. Let this count be `N`.
3.  If `N` equals 1 (meaning the input grid contains only one color), the output grid is identical to the input grid.
4.  If `N` is greater than 1, create a new output grid where each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid is expanded into an `N`x`N` block of the same color in the output grid. The dimensions of the output grid will be `(input_height * N)` rows and `(input_width * N)` columns. Specifically, the pixel at input coordinates `(r, c)` with color `C` maps to the block of pixels in the output grid covering rows `r*N` to `r*N + N - 1` and columns `c*N` to `c*N + N - 1`, all filled with color `C`.
