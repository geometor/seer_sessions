The input grids contain scattered pixels of various colors, while the output grids are mostly white, featuring only the 3x3 pattern. The central pixel of the output pattern retains the color of the unique pixel identified in the input, and the eight surrounding pixels of the pattern are colored red (2). All other pixels in the output grid are white (0). The key seems to be finding the pixel whose color value appears only once in the entire input grid.\n\n*   **Facts YAML**:\n    "
