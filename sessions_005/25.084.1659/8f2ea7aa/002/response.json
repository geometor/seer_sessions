            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying a single non-white object in the 9x9 input grid, determining the 3x3 block it resides in, and then replicating that object into a set of target 3x3 blocks in the output grid based on a mapping rule derived from the input block's coordinates.\n\nThe analysis shows the code correctly identifies the object, its color, its shape relative to its block, and the input block coordinates. However, the mapping rule used to determine the target output blocks was incorrect, leading to errors in Examples 1 and 3. Example 2 succeeded because the incorrect mapping happened to match the required output for that specific input block coordinate.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution**\n\nThe primary issue is the incorrect mapping between the input block coordinates and the target output block coordinates in the `get_target_blocks` function. The strategy is to:\n\n1.  Correctly identify the mapping rule by analyzing the relationship between the input block location and the output block locations across *all* provided training examples.\n2.  Update the `get_target_blocks` function or the mapping dictionary it uses to reflect this corrected rule.\n3.  The rest of the logic (object identification, relative shape extraction, and object placement) appears sound and should remain unchanged.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nUsing code execution to analyze the relationship between input and output blocks across the examples:\n"
