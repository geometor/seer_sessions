Transformation Rule:
1. Analyze the 9x9 input grid to find the single contiguous object composed of non-white pixels. Determine the object's color.
2. Identify which of the nine 3x3 blocks (indexed 0-2 for rows and columns) contains the top-leftmost pixel of the object. Record these as the input block coordinates (InputBlockRow, InputBlockCol).
3. Determine the object's shape relative to the top-left corner of its containing 3x3 block. Represent this shape as a list of (row_offset, col_offset) pairs, where offsets range from 0 to 2.
4. Use the input block coordinates (InputBlockRow, InputBlockCol) to determine a specific set of target 3x3 block coordinates for the output grid based on the following predefined mapping:
    - If (InputBlockRow, InputBlockCol) is (0, 0), target blocks are [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)].
    - If (InputBlockRow, InputBlockCol) is (0, 1), target blocks are [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1)].
    - If (InputBlockRow, InputBlockCol) is (1, 1), target blocks are [(0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)].
    - (Assume other input coordinates might follow a pattern, but only these are defined by examples).
5. Create a new 9x9 output grid, initially filled entirely with white (color 0).
6. For each target block coordinate (TargetBlockRow, TargetBlockCol) obtained from the mapping:
    - Calculate the absolute top-left pixel coordinate of the target block: (TargetBlockRow * 3, TargetBlockCol * 3).
    - Iterate through the object's relative shape coordinates (row_offset, col_offset).
    - For each offset, calculate the absolute output pixel coordinate: (TargetBlockRow * 3 + row_offset, TargetBlockCol * 3 + col_offset).
    - Set the color of this pixel in the output grid to the object's color.
7. The final 9x9 grid with the replicated objects is the result.
