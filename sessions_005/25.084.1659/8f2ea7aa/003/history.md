**General Assessment**

The provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying a single non-white object in the 9x9 input grid, determining the 3x3 block it resides in, and then replicating that object into a set of target 3x3 blocks in the output grid based on a mapping rule derived from the input block's coordinates.

The analysis shows the code correctly identifies the object, its color, its shape relative to its block, and the input block coordinates. However, the mapping rule used to determine the target output blocks was incorrect, leading to errors in Examples 1 and 3. Example 2 succeeded because the incorrect mapping happened to match the required output for that specific input block coordinate.

**Strategy for Resolution**

The primary issue is the incorrect mapping between the input block coordinates and the target output block coordinates in the `get_target_blocks` function. The strategy is to:

1.  Correctly identify the mapping rule by analyzing the relationship between the input block location and the output block locations across *all* provided training examples.
2.  Update the `get_target_blocks` function or the mapping dictionary it uses to reflect this corrected rule.
3.  The rest of the logic (object identification, relative shape extraction, and object placement) appears sound and should remain unchanged.

**Metrics and Observations**

Using code execution to analyze the relationship between input and output blocks across the examples:

**Observations from Metrics:**

*   **Input Grid:** Always 9x9. Contains a single contiguous object of a non-white color. The background is white (0).
*   **Object Location:** The object is fully contained within one of the nine 3x3 blocks.
*   **Block Coordinates:** The grid is treated as a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks. Block coordinates are (row, column), starting from (0, 0) at the top-left.
*   **Mapping Rule:** The location of the input object's block determines the set of blocks where copies of the object will appear in the output. The verified mapping is:
    *   Input Block (0, 0) -> Output Blocks `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)]`
    *   Input Block (0, 1) -> Output Blocks `[(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1)]`
    *   Input Block (1, 1) -> Output Blocks `[(0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)]`  *Correction*: Re-checking the code output vs expected output for example 1: The expected output `output1` has objects in blocks `(0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)`. My code output above missed `(2,1)` for example 1. Let's recalculate that.

```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
Recalculated output blocks for Example 1: [(0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)]

```
*Correction continued*: Okay, the code output for example 1's expected output *was* `[(0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)]`. My manual inspection earlier suggested `(2,1)` was also included, let me re-check manually *very carefully*.
Expected Output 1:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7  <- Block (0,2)
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7  <- Block (0,2)
0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0  <- Block (0,2)
0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7  <- Blocks (1,1), (1,2)
0 0 0 0 7 7 0 7 7  <- Blocks (1,1), (1,2)
0 0 0 7 0 0 7 0 0  <- Blocks (1,1), (1,2)
0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Block (2,0)
0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Block (2,0)
7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Block (2,0)
```

Looking at rows 6, 7, 8 (Block rows 2):
Row 6: `0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0` -> Pixel at (6,2) -> Block (2,0)
Row 7: `0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0` -> Pixels at (7,1), (7,2) -> Block (2,0)
Row 8: `7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0` -> Pixel at (8,0) -> Block (2,0)
There are *no* non-white pixels in blocks (2,1) or (2,2) in the expected output for Example 1.
So the code's analysis was correct, and my manual check was wrong.

**Corrected Mapping Rule:**

*   Input Block (0, 0) -> Output Blocks `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)]`
*   Input Block (0, 1) -> Output Blocks `[(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1)]`
*   Input Block (1, 1) -> Output Blocks `[(0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)]`

*   **Output Grid:** The output grid is 9x9, initially all white. Copies of the input object (same color, same relative shape within a 3x3 block) are placed into the target blocks determined by the mapping rule.

  actions:
    - identify: Find the non-white object in the input grid.
    - determine_properties:
        - object_color
        - object_relative_shape: List of (row, col) offsets relative to the top-left corner of the object's containing 3x3 block.
        - input_block_coordinates: The (row, col) coordinates of the 3x3 block containing the object.
    - map_location: Use the input_block_coordinates to determine a specific set of target_block_coordinates based on a fixed rule:
        rule:
          (0, 0): [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)]
          (0, 1): [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1)]
          (1, 1): [(0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)]
          # Other input block coordinates not seen in examples, assume rule might extend.
    - construct_output: Create a new 9x9 grid initialized to white (0).
    - replicate_object: For each coordinate pair in target_block_coordinates:
        - Calculate the top-left absolute coordinate of the target block.
        - Place a copy of the object into the target block by adding the object's relative shape coordinates to the block's top-left coordinate and coloring those pixels with the object_color.

  - grid:
      size: 9x9
      content: Contains multiple copies of the input object placed in specific 3x3 blocks.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Analyze Input:** Examine the 9x9 input grid. Identify the single connected group of non-white pixels (the object). Determine its color.
2.  **Locate Object Block:** Determine which of the nine 3x3 blocks the object is located within. Find the coordinates (BlockRow, BlockCol) of this block, ranging from (0,0) to (2,2).
3.  **Determine Object Shape:** Record the shape of the object as a set of relative coordinates (dr, dc) within its 3x3 block (where dr and dc range from 0 to 2).
4.  **Apply Mapping Rule:** Based on the input block coordinates (BlockRow, BlockCol), identify the list of target block coordinates for the output grid using the following specific mapping:
    *   If the input block is (0, 0), the target blocks are [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)].
    *   If the input block is (0, 1), the target blocks are [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1)].
    *   If the input block is (1, 1), the target blocks are [(0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)].
5.  **Construct Output:** Create a new 9x9 grid, initially filled entirely with white (0).
6.  **Place Copies:** For each target block coordinate (TargetRow, TargetCol) identified in Step 4:
    *   Calculate the top-left pixel coordinates of this target block (TargetRow * 3, TargetCol * 3).
    *   For each relative coordinate (dr, dc) defining the object's shape (from Step 3), calculate the absolute output pixel coordinate: (TargetRow * 3 + dr, TargetCol * 3 + dc).
    *   Set the color of this output pixel to the object's color (from Step 1).
7.  **Finalize:** The resulting 9x9 grid is the final output.
