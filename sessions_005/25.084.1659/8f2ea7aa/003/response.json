Determine the object's color.\n2. Identify which of the nine 3x3 blocks (indexed 0-2 for rows and columns) contains the top-leftmost pixel of the object. Record these as the input block coordinates (InputBlockRow, InputBlockCol).\n3. Determine the object's shape relative to the top-left corner of its containing 3x3 block. Represent this shape as a list of (row_offset, col_offset) pairs, where offsets range from 0 to 2.\n4. Use the input block coordinates (InputBlockRow, InputBlockCol) to determine a specific set of target 3x3 block coordinates for the output grid based on the following predefined mapping:\n    - If (InputBlockRow, InputBlockCol) is (0, 0), target blocks are [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)].\n    - If (InputBlockRow, InputBlockCol) is (0, 1), target blocks are [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1)].\n    - If (InputBlockRow, InputBlockCol) is (1, 1), target blocks are [(0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)].\n    - (Assume other input coordinates might follow a pattern, but only these are defined by examples).\n5. Create a new 9x9 output grid, initially filled entirely with white (color 0).\n6. For each target block coordinate (TargetBlockRow, TargetBlockCol) obtained from the mapping:\n    - Calculate the absolute top-left pixel coordinate of the target block: (TargetBlockRow * 3, TargetBlockCol * 3).\n    - Iterate through the object's relative shape coordinates (row_offset, col_offset).\n    - For each offset, calculate the absolute output pixel coordinate: (TargetBlockRow * 3 + row_offset, TargetBlockCol * 3 + col_offset).\n    - Set the color of this pixel in the output grid to the object's color.\n7. The final 9x9 grid with the replicated objects is the result.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_object_and_block(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the non-white object, its color, relative shape within its 3x3 block,\n    and the coordinates of that block based on the top-leftmost pixel.\n    Returns: object_color, relative_pattern, (block_r_in, block_c_in) or None if no object.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    object_pixels = []\n    object_color = 0\n    min_r, min_c = rows, cols\n    found_pixel = False\n\n    # Find all non-white pixels and the top-leftmost one\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0:\n                object_pixels.append((r, c))\n                if not found_pixel: # Capture color and top-left of the first non-white pixel found\n                    object_color = grid[r, c]\n                    min_r = r\n                    min_c = c\n                    found_pixel = True\n                # Optimization: if we only care about top-left for block detection,\n                # we could break outer loop earlier, but we need all pixels for shape.\n                # Update min_r/min_c if a pixel is found further up/left (though traversal order usually handles this)\n                # min_r = min(min_r, r) # Technically already done by traversal order\n                # min_c = min(min_c, c) # Technically already done by traversal order\n\n\n    if not found_pixel:\n        return None, None, None # No object found\n\n    # Determine the containing block coordinates (0-2, 0-2) based on the top-leftmost pixel\n    block_r_in = min_r // 3\n    block_c_in = min_c // 3\n\n    # Calculate the relative pattern within the block\n    relative_pattern = []\n    block_start_r = block_r_in * 3\n    block_start_c = block_c_in * 3\n    \n    # We need to iterate through *all* found pixels to get the complete shape\n    object_coords_in_block = set()\n    for r, c in object_pixels:\n         # Check if pixel r,c belongs to the *determined* block (block_r_in, block_c_in)\n         # This ensures we only capture the shape relative to the block containing the top-left pixel,\n         # even if the object might visually spill over (although this task's examples don't show that).\n        if r // 3 == block_r_in and c // 3 == block_c_in:\n            dr = r -
