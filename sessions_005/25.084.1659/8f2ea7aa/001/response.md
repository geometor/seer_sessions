"""
Identify the single non-white object in the 9x9 input grid.
Determine which 3x3 block (out of nine) contains this object.
Extract the object's color and its shape relative to the top-left corner of its containing block.
Based on the coordinates of the input block (0-2, 0-2), determine a specific set of target 3x3 block coordinates for the output grid using a predefined mapping rule:
  - (0, 0) -> [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)]
  - (0, 1) -> [(0, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]
  - (1, 1) -> [(1, 1), (0, 2), (2, 0)]
  - (Assume other rules exist if the object appeared elsewhere, though not shown in examples)
Create a 9x9 output grid initialized to white (0).
For each target block coordinate, draw a copy of the object's relative shape and color into that block in the output grid.
