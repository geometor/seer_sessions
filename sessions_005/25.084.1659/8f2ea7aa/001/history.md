Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are consistently 9x9. This size suggests a potential subdivision, possibly into 3x3 blocks of size 3x3.
2.  **Input Content:** Each input grid contains a single, small object composed of a single non-white color (orange, azure, magenta in the examples). The rest of the grid is the background color (white). Crucially, this object always seems to fit entirely within one of the conceptual 3x3 blocks.
3.  **Output Content:** The output grid contains multiple copies of the input object. The background is white. The original object appears to be present in the output in its original position. Additional copies are placed in other 3x3 block locations.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the input object, determining its location within the 3x3 block structure, and then replicating this object into a specific set of blocks in the output grid. The key challenge is figuring out the rule that determines *which* blocks receive copies based on the input block's location.
5.  **Object Integrity:** The shape and color of the object are perfectly preserved in all copies. No rotation, scaling, or color change occurs.
6.  **Block Mapping:**
    *   In Example 1, the object is in the center block (1, 1). Copies appear in the center (1, 1), top-right (0, 2), and bottom-left (2, 0).
    *   In Example 2, the object is in the top-left block (0, 0). Copies appear in the top-left (0, 0), top-center (0, 1), center-right (1, 2), and bottom-left (2, 0).
    *   In Example 3, the object is in the top-center block (0, 1). Copies appear in the top-center (0, 1), bottom-left (2, 0), bottom-center (2, 1), and bottom-right (2, 2).
    The rule for placing copies seems directly tied to the coordinate of the block containing the input object.

```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensions: [9, 9]
  conceptual_subdivision:
    type: Grid of blocks
    grid_layout: [3, 3] # 3 rows, 3 columns of blocks
    block_dimensions: [3, 3]
  background_color: 0 # white

input_properties:
  - name: object
    description: A single contiguous group of non-white pixels.
    attributes:
      - color: The single color of the object (varies per example: 7, 8, 6).
      - shape: The specific arrangement of pixels forming the object.
      - location: Fits entirely within one 3x3 block of the conceptual subdivision.
      - block_coordinates: The (row, column) index [0-2, 0-2] of the block containing the object.

output_properties:
  - name: object_copies
    description: Multiple instances of the input object placed on the output grid.
    attributes:
      - count: Varies depending on the input object's block location (3 or 4 copies in examples).
      - color: Identical to the input object's color.
      - shape: Identical to the input object's shape.
      - placement: Each copy is placed within a specific 3x3 block. The set of blocks used for placement is determined by the input object's block coordinates.

relationships_and_actions:
  - action: Identify_Input_Object
    actor: System
    input: Input grid
    output: Object color, shape (relative pixel coordinates within its block), and block coordinates (br_in, bc_in).
  - action: Determine_Target_Blocks
    actor: System
    input: Input object's block coordinates (br_in, bc_in).
    output: A set of target block coordinates {(br_out, bc_out), ...} for placing copies.
    rule: Based on observed examples:
      '(0, 0)' -> {'(0, 0)', '(0, 1)', '(1, 2)', '(2, 0)'}
      '(0, 1)' -> {'(0, 1)', '(2, 0)', '(2, 1)', '(2, 2)'}
      '(1, 1)' -> {'(1, 1)', '(0, 2)', '(2, 0)'}
      # Other mappings are undefined by examples but assumed to exist.
  - action: Generate_Output_Grid
    actor: System
    input: Input object's relative shape/color, Set of target block coordinates.
    output: Output grid.
    process: Initialize a 9x9 white grid. For each target block (br_out, bc_out), place a copy of the object's shape/color, positioning it relative to the top-left corner of that block (absolute coordinates: row = br_out*3 + relative_row, col = bc_out*3 + relative_col).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Analyze Input:** Examine the 9x9 input grid. Locate the single connected object composed of non-white pixels. Note its color.
2.  **Determine Input Block:** Identify which 3x3 block (out of the nine possible blocks arranged in a 3x3 grid) contains the entire object. Record the row index (`R_in`) and column index (`C_in`) of this block (indices range from 0 to 2).
3.  **Extract Object Pattern:** Define the object's pattern as the set of relative coordinates (`dr`, `dc`) of its constituent pixels, where `dr` and `dc` range from 0 to 2, relative to the top-left corner of the block identified in Step 2.
4.  **Map Input Block to Output Blocks:** Use the input block coordinates (`R_in`, `C_in`) to determine the set of output block coordinates (`R_out`, `C_out`) where copies should be placed. Apply the specific mapping rule observed in the training examples:
    *   If (`R_in`, `C_in`) is (0, 0), the target blocks are (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0).
    *   If (`R_in`, `C_in`) is (0, 1), the target blocks are (0, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2).
    *   If (`R_in`, `C_in`) is (1, 1), the target blocks are (1, 1), (0, 2), (2, 0).
    *   (Assume corresponding rules exist if the input object is found in other block locations).
5.  **Construct Output:** Create a new 9x9 grid initialized entirely with the background color (white).
6.  **Place Copies:** For each target block coordinate (`R_out`, `C_out`) identified in Step 4:
    *   Iterate through the relative coordinates (`dr`, `dc`) defining the object pattern extracted in Step 3.
    *   For each (`dr`, `dc`), calculate the absolute output grid coordinate: `row = R_out * 3 + dr`, `col = C_out * 3 + dc`.
    *   Set the pixel at (`row`, `col`) in the output grid to the object's color noted in Step 1.
7.  **Finalize:** The resulting grid after placing all copies is the final output.
