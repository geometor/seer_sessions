            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are consistently 9x9. This size suggests a potential subdivision, possibly into 3x3 blocks of size 3x3.\n2.  **Input Content:** Each input grid contains a single, small object composed of a single non-white color (orange, azure, magenta in the examples). The rest of the grid is the background color (white). Crucially, this object always seems to fit entirely within one of the conceptual 3x3 blocks.\n3.  **Output Content:** The output grid contains multiple copies of the input object. The background is white. The original object appears to be present in the output in its original position. Additional copies are placed in other 3x3 block locations.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the input object, determining its location within the 3x3 block structure, and then replicating this object into a specific set of blocks in the output grid. The key challenge is figuring out the rule that determines *which* blocks receive copies based on the input block's location.\n5.  **Object Integrity:** The shape and color of the object are perfectly preserved in all copies. No rotation, scaling, or color change occurs.\n6.  **Block Mapping:**\n    *   In Example 1, the object is in the center block (1, 1). Copies appear in the center (1, 1), top-right (0, 2), and bottom-left (2, 0).\n    *   In Example 2, the object is in the top-left block (0, 0). Copies appear in the top-left (0, 0), top-center (0, 1), center-right (1, 2), and bottom-left (2, 0).\n    *   In Example 3, the object is in the top-center block (0, 1). Copies appear in the top-center (0, 1), bottom-left (2, 0), bottom-center (2, 1), and bottom-right (2, 2).\n    The rule for placing copies seems directly tied to the coordinate of the block containing the input object.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Note its color.\n2.  **Determine Input Block:** Identify which 3x3 block (out of the nine possible blocks arranged in a 3x3 grid) contains the entire object. Record the row index (`R_in`) and column index (`C_in`) of this block (indices range from 0 to 2).\n3.  **Extract Object Pattern:** Define the object's pattern as the set of relative coordinates (`dr`, `dc`) of its constituent pixels, where `dr` and `dc` range from 0 to 2, relative to the top-left corner of the block identified in Step 2.\n4.  **Map Input Block to Output Blocks:** Use the input block coordinates (`R_in`, `C_in`) to determine the set of output block coordinates (`R_out`, `C_out`) where copies should be placed. Apply the specific mapping rule observed in the training examples:\n    *   If (`R_in`, `C_in`) is (0, 0), the target blocks are (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0).\n    *   If (`R_in`, `C_in`) is (0, 1), the target blocks are (0, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2).\n    *   If (`R_in`, `C_in`) is (1, 1), the target blocks are (1, 1), (0, 2), (2, 0).\n    *   (Assume corresponding rules exist if the input object is found in other block locations).\n5.  **Construct Output:** Create a new 9x9 grid initialized entirely with the background color (white).\n6.  **Place Copies:** For each target block coordinate (`R_out`, `C_out`) identified in Step 4:\n    *   Iterate through the relative coordinates (`dr`, `dc`) defining the object pattern extracted in Step 3.\n    *   For each (`dr`, `dc`), calculate the absolute output grid coordinate: `row = R_out * 3 + dr`, `col = C_out * 3 + dc`.\n    *   Set the pixel at (`row`, `col`) in the output grid to the object's color noted in Step 1.\n7.  **Finalize:** The resulting grid after placing all copies is the final output."
