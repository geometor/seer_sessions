While the color identification seems correct for the provided examples, the flood fill implementation failed.\n\nThe core issue is that the fill logic did not correctly interpret the \"bounded\" aspect. Instead of filling only the region *enclosed* by the boundary color, starting from the seed, it filled *all* background-colored pixels reachable from the seed *without* coloring the boundary pixels themselves. This allowed the fill to \"leak\" outside the intended enclosure in both examples.\n\nOur strategy will be to refine the understanding of the transformation to incorporate the concept of an \"enclosed region\". We need a way to distinguish background pixels *inside* the boundary enclosure from those *outside*.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's gather some specific metrics for each example to confirm our assessment.\n\n"
