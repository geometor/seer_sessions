task_description: |-
  Identifies three distinct colors in the input grid:
  1. Background Color: The most frequently occurring color.
  2. Seed Color: The color that appears exactly once.
  3. Boundary Color: The third distinct color.
  The transformation involves filling certain background pixels with the seed color based on the seed pixel's location.

parameters:
  - name: background_color
    description: The most frequent color in the input grid.
  - name: seed_color
    description: The unique color appearing only once in the input grid.
  - name: seed_location
    description: The (row, column) coordinates of the seed color pixel.
  - name: boundary_color
    description: The third distinct color in the input grid (neither background nor seed).

objects:
  - object: grid
    description: The 2D input array of pixels.
  - object: background_pixels
    description: All pixels in the grid matching the background_color.
    properties:
      - color: background_color
      - coordinates: list of (row, col)
  - object: seed_pixel
    description: The single pixel matching the seed_color.
    properties:
      - color: seed_color
      - coordinates: seed_location (row, col)
  - object: boundary_pixels
    description: All pixels in the grid matching the boundary_color.
    properties:
      - color: boundary_color
      - coordinates: list of (row, col)
  - object: fill_start_pixels
    description: >
      The initial set of pixels from which the fill originates.
      Includes the seed_pixel's location and all background_pixels
      located in the same row or same column as the seed_pixel.
    properties:
      - coordinates: list of (row, col)
  - object: fill_area
    description: >
      The final area to be filled with the seed_color. Determined by a
      flood fill starting from fill_start_pixels. The fill spreads only
      to adjacent background_pixels and is blocked by boundary_pixels.
      Includes the fill_start_pixels themselves.
    properties:
      - color: seed_color (in output)
      - coordinates: list of (row, col)

actions:
  - action: identify_colors
    description: Count pixel occurrences to find background, seed, and boundary colors and seed location.
    inputs:
      - grid
    outputs:
      - background_color
      - seed_color
      - seed_location
      - boundary_color
  - action: identify_fill_starts
    description: Find all background pixels in the seed pixel's row and column. Combine these with the seed location.
    inputs:
      - grid
      - background_color
      - seed_location
    outputs:
      - fill_start_pixels (coordinates)
  - action: perform_flood_fill
    description: >
      Starting from fill_start_pixels, find all reachable background_pixels
      without crossing boundary_pixels. This defines the fill_area.
    inputs:
      - grid
      - background_color
      - boundary_color
      - fill_start_pixels (coordinates)
    outputs:
      - fill_area (coordinates)
  - action: generate_output
    description: Create a copy of the input grid. Change the color of all pixels within the fill_area coordinates to the seed_color.
    inputs:
      - grid
      - seed_color
      - fill_area (coordinates)
    outputs:
      - output_grid
