The original background color within this enclosed area is replaced by the fill color. The boundary pixels themselves remain unchanged, as does the original seed pixel (though it's now surrounded by pixels of its own color).\n\nThe filling process appears to operate like a flood fill algorithm constrained by the boundary color pixels. The fill spreads cardinally (up, down, left, right) but does not cross or replace the boundary pixels.\n\n*   In `train_1`: The background is green (3), the boundary is blue (1), and the seed/fill color is magenta (6). The magenta color spreads from the initial point (5, 4), replacing green pixels until it hits blue pixels or the grid edges.\n*   In `train_2`: The background is blue (1), the boundary is red (2), and the seed/fill color is green (3). The green color spreads from the initial point (5, 5), replacing blue pixels until it hits red pixels or the grid edges.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
