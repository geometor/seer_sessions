            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the three key colors (background, seed, boundary) based on their frequencies (most frequent, unique count of 1, remaining). It also correctly identified the single seed pixel location. However, the flood fill implementation was flawed. Instead of filling the area *bounded* by the boundary color, it filled almost the entire grid, replacing all background pixels regardless of their position relative to the boundary. The boundary pixels themselves were correctly preserved, but the fill operation did not respect them as limits.\n\nThe strategy needs to be revised to implement a true bounded flood fill. The fill should only propagate to adjacent background pixels and stop exploring from a pixel if it reaches a boundary pixel or the grid edge.\n\n**Metrics**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Colors: Green (3): 110, Blue (1): 10, Magenta (6): 1\n    *   Identified: Background=Green (3), Seed=Magenta (6) at (5, 4), Boundary=Blue (1)\n    *   Expected Output: Magenta (6) fills 45 pixels (the original seed + 44 Green pixels). Green (3) remains 66 pixels. Blue (1) remains 10 pixels.\n    *   Transformed Output: Magenta (6) fills 111 pixels (the original seed + 110 Green pixels). Blue (1) remains 10 pixels.\n    *   Difference: The transformed output incorrectly changed 66 Green pixels (110 - 44) outside the boundary to Magenta.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Colors: Blue (1): 123, Red (2): 8, Green (3): 1\n    *   Identified: Background=Blue (1), Seed=Green (3) at (5, 5), Boundary=Red (2)\n    *   Expected Output: Green (3) fills 56 pixels (the original seed + 55 Blue pixels). Blue (1) remains 68 pixels. Red (2) remains 8 pixels.\n    *   Transformed Output: Green (3) fills 124 pixels (the original seed + 123 Blue pixels). Red (2) remains 8 pixels.\n    *   Difference: The transformed output incorrectly changed 68 Blue pixels (123 - 55) outside the boundary to Green.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
