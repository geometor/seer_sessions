task_description: Identify horizontal objects in each row and write a color corresponding to the object's length (and sometimes original color) into a specific column marked by a gray pixel.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors (0-9).
  - element: marker
    type: pixel
    color: gray (5)
    location: Always in the top row (row 0), column varies.
    function: Identifies the target column for modifications.
  - element: object
    type: horizontal_segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of non-white (0) and non-gray (5) pixels within a single row. Assumed unique per relevant row.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels forming the object.
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment (width).
      - row_index: The row where the object is located.
  - element: target_cell
    type: pixel
    location: Intersection of an object's row_index and the marker's column index.
    initial_state: Must be white (0) in the input grid.
    final_state: Color determined by the properties of the object in the same row.

relationships:
  - type: identifies
    subject: marker
    object: target_column
    details: The column index of the gray (5) pixel in row 0 is the target column.
  - type: determines
    subject: object properties (length, sometimes color)
    object: target_cell final_state (color)
    details: A mapping exists from object length (and potentially color for length 5) to the output color placed in the target cell.
      - Length 2 -> Color 1 (blue)
      - Length 3 -> Color 4 (yellow)
      - Length 4 -> Color 9 (maroon)
      - Length 5, Object Color 9 (maroon) -> Color 6 (magenta)
      - Length 5, Object Color 7 (orange) -> Color 9 (maroon)

actions:
  - action: find_marker_column
    actor: system
    input: input_grid
    output: column_index
    description: Locate the column index of the gray (5) pixel in the first row (row 0).
  - action: scan_rows
    actor: system
    input: input_grid
    output: objects_found
    description: Iterate through each row (starting from row 1) to find horizontal objects.
  - action: identify_object
    actor: system
    input: row_data
    output: object_properties (color, length, row_index) or None
    description: Find the first contiguous horizontal segment of non-white (0) and non-gray (5) pixels in the row. Extract its color and length.
  - action: apply_mapping
    actor: system
    input: object_properties (length, color)
    output: output_color
    description: Use the established mapping rules (based on length and sometimes original color) to determine the color for the target cell.
  - action: update_grid
    actor: system
    input: input_grid, row_index, target_column, output_color
    output: modified_grid
    description: Create a copy of the input grid. If an object was found in a row and the cell at (row_index, target_column) is white (0), update that cell's color to the output_color.
