            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Each input and output is a 2D grid of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9. White (0) is the predominant background color.\n2.  **Key Marker:** A single gray (5) pixel appears in the top row (row 0) of every input grid. Its column position varies between examples.\n3.  **Objects:** In rows below the top row, there are horizontal contiguous segments (objects) of colors other than white (0) or gray (5). Each relevant row appears to contain only one such object.\n4.  **Transformation Locus:** The changes between input and output grids occur exclusively in the column marked by the gray (5) pixel in the top row. Let's call this the \"target column\".\n5.  **Transformation Nature:** White (0) pixels in the target column are changed to a specific color in the output grid. The color they change *to* depends on the properties of the object found in the *same row*.\n6.  **Object Property -> Output Color Mapping:** The length (width) of the horizontal object in a given row determines the color placed in the target column for that row. There appears to be a specific mapping:\n    *   Length 2 -> Color 1 (blue)\n    *   Length 3 -> Color 4 (yellow)\n    *   Length 4 -> Color 9 (maroon)\n    *   Length 5 -> Depends on the object's *original* color:\n        *   If the object's color is 9 (maroon), the output color is 6 (magenta).\n        *   If the object's color is 7 (orange), the output color is 9 (maroon).\n    *   This mapping seems consistent across all provided examples.\n7.  **Condition:** The transformation only occurs in rows that contain a non-white, non-gray object, and it only modifies the pixel in the target column if it is initially white (0).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
