task_elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors.
  - element: gray_line
    description: A vertical segment of gray (5) pixels starting at position (0,0) in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: 5 (gray)
      - position: Starts at (0,0), extends downwards in column 0.
      - height: Variable across examples, denoted as H.
      - role: Defines the block height for the output pattern and remains unchanged in the output.
  - element: color_columns_block
    description: A contiguous block of 2 or more columns on the right side of the input grid, where each column consists of a single non-white color.
    properties:
      - location: Right side of the input grid.
      - content: Solid vertical columns of distinct colors (or potentially repeating colors, although not seen here).
      - columns: Let the colors be C1, C2, ..., Ck from left to right.
      - start_column_index: The index of the leftmost column in this block, denoted as S.
  - element: output_column
    description: A single column in the output grid containing a vertically stacked pattern of colors derived from the input color_columns_block.
    properties:
      - location: Column index S-1.
      - content: Pixels colored according to a repeating pattern based on C1, C2, ..., Ck and the height H of the gray_line.
      - background: All other cells in the output grid (aside from the gray_line) are white (0).

relationships:
  - relationship: input_output_dimensions
    description: The output grid has the same height and width as the input grid.
  - relationship: gray_line_persistence
    description: The gray_line from the input is copied exactly to the output.
  - relationship: output_column_position
    description: The output_column is located one column to the left of the start_column_index (S) of the input color_columns_block. (Output column index = S - 1).
  - relationship: output_pattern_definition
    description: The colors in the output_column are determined by cyclically repeating the sequence of colors (C1, C2, ..., Ck) from the input color_columns_block. Each color in the sequence occupies a vertical block of H rows in the output_column, where H is the height of the gray_line.
