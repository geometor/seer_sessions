            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid contains a vertical gray (5) line segment starting at the top-left corner (0,0). The rest of the grid is mostly white (0), except for a block of 2 or 3 solid-colored vertical columns located towards the right side of the grid.\n2.  **Output Structure:** Each output grid retains the gray line segment in the exact same position as the input. A *single* new vertical column of colored pixels is created, positioned one column to the left of where the colored block started in the input. The rest of the output grid is white (0).\n3.  **Color Transformation:** The colors from the input columns on the right are rearranged and stacked vertically within the single output column.\n4.  **Pattern Repetition:** The stacking pattern seems related to the height of the initial gray line segment. Let the height of the gray segment be `H`. The colors from the input columns (let's call them `C1, C2, ... Ck` from left to right) are placed sequentially in the output column in blocks of height `H`. The sequence `C1, C2, ..., Ck` repeats down the output column. For example, rows 0 to `H-1` get color `C1`, rows `H` to `2H-1` get color `C2`, ..., rows `(k-1)H` to `kH-1` get color `Ck`, rows `kH` to `(k+1)H-1` get color `C1` again, and so on, until the bottom of the grid is reached.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Examine column 0 of the input grid to find the vertical gray (5) line starting at (0,0). Determine its height, `H`.\n3.  Copy this gray line segment (column 0, rows 0 to `H-1`) to the same position in the output grid.\n4.  Scan the input grid from right to left, top to bottom, to find the first non-white column. This marks the start of the color columns block. Let the index of this first column be `S`.\n5.  Identify the sequence of colors present in the columns starting from index `S` moving rightwards. Read the color of the top pixel (or any pixel, as they are solid colors) in each column of the block. Store these colors in a list, `colors = [C1, C2, ..., Ck]`.\n6.  Determine the target column index in the output grid: `output_col_index = S - 1`.\n7.  Iterate through the rows `r` of the grid, from `r = 0` to `grid_height - 1`.\n8.  For each row `r`, calculate the index `color_index = floor(r / H) % k`, where `k` is the number of colors identified in step 5.\n9.  Get the color `current_color = colors[color_index]`.\n10. Set the pixel in the output grid at `(r, output_col_index)` to `current_color`.\n11. Return the completed output grid."
