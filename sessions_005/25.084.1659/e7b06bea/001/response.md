"""
Processes an input grid based on the following rules:

1. Identifies a vertical gray (5) line starting at (0,0) in the input grid and determines its height (H).
2. Identifies a block of solid-colored vertical columns located towards the right side of the input grid. It extracts the sequence of colors (C1, C2, ..., Ck) from these columns and notes the starting column index (S) of this block.
3. Creates an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initially filled with white (0).
4. Copies the gray line from the input to the same position in the output grid.
5. Determines the target column index in the output grid as S-1.
6. Populates the target column (S-1) in the output grid by vertically stacking blocks of colors. The sequence of colors used is C1, C2, ..., Ck, repeated cyclically. Each color C_i in the sequence occupies a vertical block of H rows. The pattern starts with C1 for rows 0 to H-1, C2 for rows H to 2H-1, ..., Ck for rows (k-1)H to kH-1, then C1 again for rows kH to (k+1)H-1, and so on, down the entire column.
7. Returns the modified output grid.
