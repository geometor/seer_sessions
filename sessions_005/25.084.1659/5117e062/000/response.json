            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids are consistently 13x13. They contain several small, distinct objects composed of non-white pixels, scattered on a white background.\n2.  **Objects:** The objects are typically simple shapes. Notably, in each example, exactly one object contains an azure (8) pixel, usually near its center. This object is composed primarily of another color (green in train_1, yellow in train_2, red in train_3). Other objects exist but do not contain azure pixels.\n3.  **Output Grid:** The output grids are always 3x3.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to focus specifically on the azure pixel and its immediate surroundings. The output grid appears to be a direct copy of the 3x3 area centered on the azure pixel in the input grid, with one modification: the central azure pixel itself is replaced.\n5.  **Color Replacement:** The azure pixel in the center of the 3x3 output is replaced by the dominant non-white, non-azure color found within that 3x3 neighborhood in the input. In all examples, this replacement color is the primary color of the object containing the azure pixel (green, yellow, red respectively).\n\n**Facts YAML**\n\n"
