task_description: Identify the azure pixel, extract its 3x3 neighborhood, and replace the central azure pixel with the dominant neighboring color.
grid_properties:
  input_size: 13x13
  output_size: 3x3
  background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: marker_pixel
    color: 8 (azure)
    occurrence: exactly one per input grid
    role: defines the center of the transformation area
  - type: primary_object
    description: The object containing the azure pixel.
    properties:
      - has a primary color (non-white, non-azure)
      - contains the azure pixel
  - type: other_objects
    description: Other distinct shapes in the input grid.
    properties:
      - do not contain azure pixels
      - seem irrelevant to the transformation
transformation_area:
  shape: square
  size: 3x3
  location: centered on the azure pixel in the input grid
actions:
  - action: locate
    target: azure pixel (8)
    result: coordinates (row, col)
  - action: extract
    target: 3x3 neighborhood around the azure pixel's coordinates
    result: 3x3 subgrid from input
  - action: identify_replacement_color
    source: the extracted 3x3 subgrid
    method: find the most frequent color that is not white (0) and not azure (8)
    result: replacement_color
  - action: generate_output
    size: 3x3
    method: copy the extracted 3x3 subgrid, replacing the central pixel (originally azure) with the replacement_color
