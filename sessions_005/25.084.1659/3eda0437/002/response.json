            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempted to solve the task by finding white rectangular blocks and filling one based on a set of criteria. However, it failed on three out of four training examples. The analysis revealed two key issues:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Selection Criteria:** The code prioritized maximum height, then maximum area. Analysis of the failed examples strongly suggests the criteria should be: maximum area first, then maximum height, then top-most row, then left-most column.\n2.  **Potential Rectangle Identification Bug:** The way rectangles were identified or selected in the failed examples (particularly Example 2) led to incorrect shapes/locations being filled, sometimes even seeming to overwrite non-white pixels. This implies the `find_white_rectangles` function either doesn't correctly identify *maximal* white rectangles or has a bug in how it calculates their dimensions or positions, possibly exacerbated by considering all sub-rectangles instead of only maximal ones.\n\nThe strategy for resolution is to:\n1.  Correct the selection criteria in the logic.\n2.  Revise or rewrite the function responsible for finding white rectangles to ensure it correctly identifies all *maximal* white rectangles.\n3.  Apply the corrected selection criteria to the list of maximal white rectangles.\n4.  Fill the uniquely selected rectangle with magenta.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe following metrics were gathered by analyzing the input grids, expected outputs, and the outputs generated by the previous code attempt. Properties relate to the single white rectangle that should be filled.\n\n"
