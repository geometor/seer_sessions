Task: Fill a specific white rectangle with magenta.

Input: Grid containing pixels of various colors (0-9).
Output: Grid identical to the input, except for one filled rectangle.

Objects:
  - Type: Maximal Contiguous Rectangular Block
    Properties:
      - Composed solely of white pixels (color 0).
      - Defined by top-left corner (row, column), height, and width.
      - Has an area (height * width).
    Identification: Must find all such blocks within the input grid.

Actions:
  - Selection: Identify *all* maximal white rectangles in the input grid.
  - Filtering/Sorting: Choose a single rectangle from the identified set based on hierarchical criteria:
    1. Priority 1: Maximum Area (largest height * width).
    2. Priority 2: Maximum Height (tallest, break ties in area).
    3. Priority 3: Minimum Row index (top-most, break ties in area and height).
    4. Priority 4: Minimum Column index (left-most, break ties in area, height, and row).
  - Transformation: Modify the input grid by changing the color of all pixels within the bounds of the *selected* maximal white rectangle to magenta (color 6). All other pixels remain unchanged.

Edge Cases:
  - No white rectangles: The output grid should be identical to the input grid.
  - Multiple rectangles satisfying all criteria: This shouldn't happen if the criteria are applied correctly, as the row/column criteria ensure uniqueness.
