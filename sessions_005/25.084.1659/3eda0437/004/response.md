Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding of the task.

**General Assessment**

The provided code correctly implements the logic derived from the initial examples: find maximal white rectangles and select one based on max area -> max height -> min row -> min col. This logic worked for Examples 1, 2, and 3 but failed on Example 4.

The failure in Example 4 indicates that the selection criteria inferred previously were incorrect.
- Input 4 has multiple maximal white rectangles.
- The code selected a 1x10 (Area=10) rectangle at (0, 7) based on the `max area` primary criterion.
- The expected output requires filling a 2x4 (Area=8) rectangle at (1, 15).

This suggests that the primary sorting criterion is not `area`. Comparing the selected rectangle (1x10) and the desired rectangle (2x4), the desired one has a greater `height`. Let's hypothesize that `height` is the primary selection criterion, followed by `area`, then `row`, then `col`.

**Strategy:**

1.  Verify the maximal white rectangles found in Example 4.
2.  Test the new selection criteria (max height -> max area -> min row -> min col) against all four examples.
3.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program based on the revised understanding.

**Metrics and Verification**
