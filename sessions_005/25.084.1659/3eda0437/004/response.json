This logic worked for Examples 1, 2, and 3 but failed on Example 4.\n\nThe failure in Example 4 indicates that the selection criteria inferred previously were incorrect.\n- Input 4 has multiple maximal white rectangles.\n- The code selected a 1x10 (Area=10) rectangle at (0, 7) based on the `max area` primary criterion.\n- The expected output requires filling a 2x4 (Area=8) rectangle at (1, 15).\n\nThis suggests that the primary sorting criterion is not `area`. Comparing the selected rectangle (1x10) and the desired rectangle (2x4), the desired one has a greater `height`. Let's hypothesize that `height` is the primary selection criterion, followed by `area`, then `row`, then `col`.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Verify the maximal white rectangles found in Example 4.\n2.  Test the new selection criteria (max height -> max area -> min row -> min col) against all four examples.\n3.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program based on the revised understanding.\n\n**Metrics and Verification**\n"
