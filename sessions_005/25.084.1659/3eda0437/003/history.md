Finds all rectangular blocks composed entirely of white (0) pixels in the input grid.

1. Maximum height.
2. Maximum area (width * height). If heights are equal, this means maximum width.
3. Minimum row index of the top-left corner (top-most).

## General Assessment

The provided code attempted to solve the task by finding white rectangular blocks and filling one based on a set of criteria. However, it failed on three out of four training examples. The analysis revealed two key issues:

1.  **Incorrect Selection Criteria:** The code prioritized maximum height, then maximum area. Analysis of the failed examples strongly suggests the criteria should be: maximum area first, then maximum height, then top-most row, then left-most column.
2.  **Potential Rectangle Identification Bug:** The way rectangles were identified or selected in the failed examples (particularly Example 2) led to incorrect shapes/locations being filled, sometimes even seeming to overwrite non-white pixels. This implies the `find_white_rectangles` function either doesn't correctly identify *maximal* white rectangles or has a bug in how it calculates their dimensions or positions, possibly exacerbated by considering all sub-rectangles instead of only maximal ones.

The strategy for resolution is to:
1.  Correct the selection criteria in the logic.
2.  Revise or rewrite the function responsible for finding white rectangles to ensure it correctly identifies all *maximal* white rectangles.
3.  Apply the corrected selection criteria to the list of maximal white rectangles.
4.  Fill the uniquely selected rectangle with magenta.

## Metrics

The following metrics were gathered by analyzing the input grids, expected outputs, and the outputs generated by the previous code attempt. Properties relate to the single white rectangle that should be filled.



*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

# Data derived from analyzing the examples and outputs

# Example 1
expected_rect_1 = {'r': 0, 'c': 2, 'h': 2, 'w': 5, 'area': 10}
actual_rect_1 = {'r': 0, 'c': 2, 'h': 2, 'w': 5, 'area': 10} # Correctly selected

# Example 2
expected_rect_2 = {'r': 1, 'c': 14, 'h': 2, 'w': 3, 'area': 6}
# Actual filled area was grid[1:4, 15]. The intended selection based on flawed criteria (Max H) is unclear due to potential bugs, but it wasn't the expected rectangle.

# Example 3
expected_rect_3 = {'r': 0, 'c': 17, 'h': 3, 'w': 3, 'area': 9}
# Actual selected rectangle based on Max H criteria:
actual_selected_rect_3 = {'r': 0, 'c': 17, 'h': 4, 'w': 2, 'area': 8}

# Example 4
expected_rect_4 = {'r': 1, 'c': 15, 'h': 2, 'w': 4, 'area': 8}
# Actual selected rectangle based on Max H criteria:
actual_selected_rect_4 = {'r': 0, 'c': 15, 'h': 3, 'w': 2, 'area': 6}


print(f"Example 1: Expected Rect: {expected_rect_1}, Actual Rect (Code 00): {actual_rect_1}")
print(f"Example 2: Expected Rect: {expected_rect_2}, Actual Rect (Code 00): Error / Incorrect")
print(f"Example 3: Expected Rect: {expected_rect_3}, Actual Selected by Max H Logic: {actual_selected_rect_3}")
print(f"Example 4: Expected Rect: {expected_rect_4}, Actual Selected by Max H Logic: {actual_selected_rect_4}")

print("\nComparison based on REVISED criteria (Max Area -> Max H -> Min R -> Min C):")
# Ex 3: Expected (Area 9) vs Actual_MaxH (Area 8). Max Area selects Expected.
print(f"Ex 3: Selects Expected? {expected_rect_3['area'] > actual_selected_rect_3['area']}")
# Ex 4: Expected (Area 8) vs Actual_MaxH (Area 6). Max Area selects Expected.
print(f"Ex 4: Selects Expected? {expected_rect_4['area'] > actual_selected_rect_4['area']}")
```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
Example 1: Expected Rect: {'r': 0, 'c': 2, 'h': 2, 'w': 5, 'area': 10}, Actual Rect (Code 00): {'r': 0, 'c': 2, 'h': 2, 'w': 5, 'area': 10}
Example 2: Expected Rect: {'r': 1, 'c': 14, 'h': 2, 'w': 3, 'area': 6}, Actual Rect (Code 00): Error / Incorrect
Example 3: Expected Rect: {'r': 0, 'c': 17, 'h': 3, 'w': 3, 'area': 9}, Actual Selected by Max H Logic: {'r': 0, 'c': 17, 'h': 4, 'w': 2, 'area': 8}
Example 4: Expected Rect: {'r': 1, 'c': 15, 'h': 2, 'w': 4, 'area': 8}, Actual Selected by Max H Logic: {'r': 0, 'c': 15, 'h': 3, 'w': 2, 'area': 6}

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Fill a specific white rectangle with magenta.

Input: Grid containing pixels of various colors (0-9).
Output: Grid identical to the input, except for one filled rectangle.

Objects:
  - Type: Maximal Contiguous Rectangular Block
    Properties:
      - Composed solely of white pixels (color 0).
      - Defined by top-left corner (row, column), height, and width.
      - Has an area (height * width).
    Identification: Must find all such blocks within the input grid.

Actions:
  - Selection: Identify *all* maximal white rectangles in the input grid.
  - Filtering/Sorting: Choose a single rectangle from the identified set based on hierarchical criteria:
    1. Priority 1: Maximum Area (largest height * width).
    2. Priority 2: Maximum Height (tallest, break ties in area).
    3. Priority 3: Minimum Row index (top-most, break ties in area and height).
    4. Priority 4: Minimum Column index (left-most, break ties in area, height, and row).
  - Transformation: Modify the input grid by changing the color of all pixels within the bounds of the *selected* maximal white rectangle to magenta (color 6). All other pixels remain unchanged.

Edge Cases:
  - No white rectangles: The output grid should be identical to the input grid.
  - Multiple rectangles satisfying all criteria: This shouldn't happen if the criteria are applied correctly, as the row/column criteria ensure uniqueness.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify all distinct *maximal* contiguous rectangular blocks within the input grid that are composed entirely of white (0) pixels. Represent each block by its top-left row index (`r`), top-left column index (`c`), height (`h`), and width (`w`).
3.  If no such white rectangles are found, return the unmodified copy of the input grid.
4.  Calculate the area (`area = h * w`) for each identified maximal white rectangle.
5.  Select a single rectangle from the set based on the following ordered criteria:
    a.  Choose the rectangle(s) with the largest `area`.
    b.  If there's a tie in `area`, choose the rectangle(s) from the tied set with the largest `height`.
    c.  If there's still a tie, choose the rectangle(s) from the tied set with the smallest `r` (top-most).
    d.  If there's still a tie, choose the unique rectangle from the tied set with the smallest `c` (left-most).
6.  Determine the coordinates (`r`, `c`, `h`, `w`) of the uniquely selected rectangle.
7.  In the output grid, change the color of all pixels within the rectangular region defined by rows `r` to `r + h - 1` and columns `c` to `c + w - 1` to magenta (6).
8.  Return the modified output grid.
