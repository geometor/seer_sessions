"""
Identifies all maximal contiguous rectangular blocks composed solely of white (0) pixels in the input grid.
Calculates the area and height for each maximal white rectangle.
Selects a single rectangle based on the following ordered criteria:
1. Maximum Height (tallest).
2. Maximum Area (largest height * width, to break ties in height).
3. Minimum Row index (top-most, to break ties in height and area).
4. Minimum Column index (left-most, to break ties in height, area, and row).
Copies the input grid to the output grid, then changes the color of all pixels within the bounds of the selected rectangle to magenta (6).
If no white rectangles are found, the output grid is identical to the input grid.
