task_description: "Fill enclosed white areas with blue if the area contains any red pixels."

definitions:
  - name: Red Structure
    description: "Connected components of red (2) pixels, often forming boundaries."
  - name: External Area
    description: "Pixels not colored red (2) that can reach the grid border via a path of non-red pixels."
  - name: Enclosed Region (Hole)
    description: "A connected component of pixels that are not part of the External Area. These regions are effectively surrounded by Red Structures. An Enclosed Region may contain pixels of various colors, including white (0) and red (2)."

transformation_rule:
  - step: "Identify all pixels belonging to the External Area using a flood fill (BFS/DFS) starting from non-red border pixels."
  - step: "Identify all connected components formed by pixels *not* in the External Area. These are the Enclosed Regions."
  - step: "For each unique Enclosed Region:"
    action:
      - check: "Examine all pixels within the current Enclosed Region."
      - condition: "Does at least one pixel within this region have the color red (2)?"
      - if_true:
          - sub_action: "Iterate through all pixels within this same Enclosed Region."
          - sub_condition: "Is the pixel's original color white (0)?"
          - sub_if_true: "Change the pixel's color to blue (1) in the output grid."
      - if_false: "Pixels in this Enclosed Region retain their original colors."
  - step: "Pixels belonging to the External Area retain their original colors."

output_grid:
  description: "The output grid is the same size as the input grid, modified according to the transformation rule."
  unchanged_pixels:
    - Red pixels (2).
    - Non-red pixels in the External Area.
    - Pixels in Enclosed Regions that do *not* contain any red pixels.
    - Non-white pixels within Enclosed Regions that *do* contain red pixels.
  changed_pixels:
    - White (0) pixels within Enclosed Regions that contain at least one red (2) pixel are changed to blue (1).
