            "text": "Okay, let's break down the analysis of the previous attempt and refine the approach.\n\n**General Assessment & Strategy:**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core concept: filling enclosed areas based on a condition. However, the implementation failed because it incorrectly defined the \"region\" used for the condition check. The `find_non_red_regions` function specifically looked for connected components of *only* non-red pixels. This meant that any red pixels *inside* the intended enclosed area were excluded from the component, causing the `contains_internal_red` check to always fail.\n\nThe strategy is to correctly identify the full extent of each enclosed region first (potentially including pixels of various colors) and *then* check for the presence of red pixels within that region before deciding whether to fill the white pixels within it. The \"Flood Fill from Outside\" approach seems most promising: identify what's *not* enclosed by finding everything reachable from the border, and then analyze the remaining areas.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's re-examine the examples based on the refined understanding:\n\n*   **Common Pattern:** All examples feature structures made of red (2) pixels that enclose areas. These enclosed areas contain a mix of white (0) pixels and sometimes other pixels, including red (2). The transformation involves changing *only* the white (0) pixels within an enclosed area to blue (1), *if and only if* that enclosed area contains at least one red (2) pixel.\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Grid: 8x8\n    *   Output Grid: 8x8\n    *   Enclosed Region: Pixels from (4,3) to (6,5). Bounded by red pixels.\n    *   Content of Enclosed Region: 8 white (0) pixels and 1 red (2) pixel at (5,4).\n    *   Condition Met: Yes, contains a red pixel.\n    *   Transformation: The 8 white pixels become blue (1).\n    *   Previous Code Failure: Failed to detect the internal red pixel because the region identification excluded it. Output matched input (0 blue pixels created). Pixels Off: 8.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Grid: 8x8\n    *   Output Grid: 8x8\n    *   Enclosed Region: Pixels from (2,2) to (4,4). Bounded by red pixels.\n    *   Content of Enclosed Region: 8 white (0) pixels and 1 red (2) pixel at (3,3).\n    *   Condition Met: Yes, contains a red pixel.\n    *   Transformation: The 8 white pixels become blue (1).\n    *   Previous Code Failure: Failed to detect the internal red pixel. Output matched input. Pixels Off: 8.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Grid: 12x12\n    *   Output Grid: 12x12\n    *   Enclosed Region 1: Area bounded by the top-left red structure (approx rows 1-7, cols 4-7).\n    *   Content of Region 1: Multiple white (0) pixels and red (2) pixels at (2,5) and (6,5).\n    *   Condition Met for Region 1: Yes, contains red pixels.\n    *   Transformation for Region 1: 18 white pixels become blue (1).\n    *   Enclosed Region 2: Area bounded by the lower-right red structure (approx rows 3-5, cols 8-10).\n    *   Content of Region 2: Multiple white (0) pixels and red (2) pixels at (3,10) and (5,10).\n    *   Condition Met for Region 2: Yes, contains red pixels.\n    *   Transformation for Region 2: 7 white pixels become blue (1).\n    *   Previous Code Failure: Failed to detect internal red pixels in both regions. Output matched input. Pixels Off: 18 + 7 = 25. (Note: The previous report showing \"Pixels Off: 22\" seems inaccurate based on visual comparison).\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
