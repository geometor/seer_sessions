Okay, let's break down the analysis of the previous attempt and refine the approach.

**General Assessment & Strategy:**

The previous code correctly identified the core concept: filling enclosed areas based on a condition. However, the implementation failed because it incorrectly defined the "region" used for the condition check. The `find_non_red_regions` function specifically looked for connected components of *only* non-red pixels. This meant that any red pixels *inside* the intended enclosed area were excluded from the component, causing the `contains_internal_red` check to always fail.

The strategy is to correctly identify the full extent of each enclosed region first (potentially including pixels of various colors) and *then* check for the presence of red pixels within that region before deciding whether to fill the white pixels within it. The "Flood Fill from Outside" approach seems most promising: identify what's *not* enclosed by finding everything reachable from the border, and then analyze the remaining areas.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Let's re-examine the examples based on the refined understanding:

*   **Common Pattern:** All examples feature structures made of red (2) pixels that enclose areas. These enclosed areas contain a mix of white (0) pixels and sometimes other pixels, including red (2). The transformation involves changing *only* the white (0) pixels within an enclosed area to blue (1), *if and only if* that enclosed area contains at least one red (2) pixel.
*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Grid: 8x8
    *   Output Grid: 8x8
    *   Enclosed Region: Pixels from (4,3) to (6,5). Bounded by red pixels.
    *   Content of Enclosed Region: 8 white (0) pixels and 1 red (2) pixel at (5,4).
    *   Condition Met: Yes, contains a red pixel.
    *   Transformation: The 8 white pixels become blue (1).
    *   Previous Code Failure: Failed to detect the internal red pixel because the region identification excluded it. Output matched input (0 blue pixels created). Pixels Off: 8.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Grid: 8x8
    *   Output Grid: 8x8
    *   Enclosed Region: Pixels from (2,2) to (4,4). Bounded by red pixels.
    *   Content of Enclosed Region: 8 white (0) pixels and 1 red (2) pixel at (3,3).
    *   Condition Met: Yes, contains a red pixel.
    *   Transformation: The 8 white pixels become blue (1).
    *   Previous Code Failure: Failed to detect the internal red pixel. Output matched input. Pixels Off: 8.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Grid: 12x12
    *   Output Grid: 12x12
    *   Enclosed Region 1: Area bounded by the top-left red structure (approx rows 1-7, cols 4-7).
    *   Content of Region 1: Multiple white (0) pixels and red (2) pixels at (2,5) and (6,5).
    *   Condition Met for Region 1: Yes, contains red pixels.
    *   Transformation for Region 1: 18 white pixels become blue (1).
    *   Enclosed Region 2: Area bounded by the lower-right red structure (approx rows 3-5, cols 8-10).
    *   Content of Region 2: Multiple white (0) pixels and red (2) pixels at (3,10) and (5,10).
    *   Condition Met for Region 2: Yes, contains red pixels.
    *   Transformation for Region 2: 7 white pixels become blue (1).
    *   Previous Code Failure: Failed to detect internal red pixels in both regions. Output matched input. Pixels Off: 18 + 7 = 25. (Note: The previous report showing "Pixels Off: 22" seems inaccurate based on visual comparison).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all pixels that are *not* red (color 2) and can reach the border of the grid through a path of adjacent non-red pixels. Mark these pixels as "external".
3.  Find all connected components of pixels that were *not* marked as "external". These components represent the "enclosed regions".
4.  For each distinct enclosed region found:
    a.  Check if any pixel within this specific region has the color red (2) in the input grid.
    b.  If the region contains at least one red pixel, then iterate through all pixel locations within this *same* region. For each location, if the pixel's color in the input grid was white (0), change its color to blue (1) in the output grid.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
