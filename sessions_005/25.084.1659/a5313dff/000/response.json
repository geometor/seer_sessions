            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0) as the background, red (2) to define structures or boundaries, and blue (1) appears only in the output grid as a fill color.\n2.  **Structures:** The red (2) pixels form closed or partially closed shapes, effectively creating boundaries. These boundaries often enclose regions of white (0) pixels.\n3.  **Internal Features:** Some of these enclosed white regions also contain isolated red (2) pixels within them (not part of the main boundary).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is a selective filling process. Certain areas of white (0) pixels in the input grid are changed to blue (1) in the output grid. The red (2) pixels remain unchanged in position and color.\n5.  **Selection Criteria:** The key challenge is determining *which* enclosed white (0) areas get filled with blue (1). Comparing the examples, it appears that an enclosed area is filled *only if* it contains at least one red (2) pixel within its boundaries in the input grid. Enclosed areas containing *only* white (0) pixels are left unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
