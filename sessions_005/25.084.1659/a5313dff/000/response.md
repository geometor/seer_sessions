Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0) as the background, red (2) to define structures or boundaries, and blue (1) appears only in the output grid as a fill color.
2.  **Structures:** The red (2) pixels form closed or partially closed shapes, effectively creating boundaries. These boundaries often enclose regions of white (0) pixels.
3.  **Internal Features:** Some of these enclosed white regions also contain isolated red (2) pixels within them (not part of the main boundary).
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is a selective filling process. Certain areas of white (0) pixels in the input grid are changed to blue (1) in the output grid. The red (2) pixels remain unchanged in position and color.
5.  **Selection Criteria:** The key challenge is determining *which* enclosed white (0) areas get filled with blue (1). Comparing the examples, it appears that an enclosed area is filled *only if* it contains at least one red (2) pixel within its boundaries in the input grid. Enclosed areas containing *only* white (0) pixels are left unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Colors:
    - white (0): Background, potentially enclosed.
    - red (2): Forms boundaries, can exist inside enclosed regions.
    - blue (1): Fill color, appears only in output.
Objects:
  - Red_Boundaries:
      - Composed of connected red (2) pixels.
      - Define enclosed regions.
      - Can be simple (rectangle) or complex.
      - Can be connected to other boundaries or isolated.
  - Enclosed_Regions (Holes):
      - Composed of non-red pixels (white (0) or internal red (2)).
      - Identified by being disconnected from the grid's border when considering only non-red paths.
      - Property: Content - Can contain only white (0) pixels, or white (0) and red (2) pixels.
  - Internal_Red_Pixels:
      - Red (2) pixels located within an Enclosed_Region.
      - Not part of the main Red_Boundary defining that region.
Relationships:
  - Red_Boundaries enclose Enclosed_Regions.
  - Internal_Red_Pixels exist inside some Enclosed_Regions.
Actions:
  - Identify Enclosed_Regions: Find connected components of non-red pixels that do not touch the grid border.
  - Check Content: For each Enclosed_Region, determine if it contains any red (2) pixels from the input grid.
  - Conditional Fill: If an Enclosed_Region contains at least one red (2) pixel, change all white (0) pixels within that specific region to blue (1) in the output grid. Otherwise, leave the region unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all non-red (pixels with values other than 2) connected components (regions) in the input grid. Use 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
3.  Determine the "exterior" region: the non-red component that includes pixels touching the border of the grid.
4.  Identify all other non-red components as "enclosed regions" or "holes".
5.  For each identified enclosed region:
    a.  Check if any pixel *within* this region corresponds to a red (2) pixel in the *original input grid*.
    b.  If the region contains at least one such red (2) pixel:
        i.  Iterate through all pixels belonging to this enclosed region.
        ii. If a pixel in the region was originally white (0) in the input grid, change its value to blue (1) in the output grid. (Leave original red pixels within the region unchanged).
6.  Return the modified output grid.
