Grid:
  Colors:
    - white (0): Background, potentially enclosed.
    - red (2): Forms boundaries, can exist inside enclosed regions.
    - blue (1): Fill color, appears only in output.
Objects:
  - Red_Boundaries:
      - Composed of connected red (2) pixels.
      - Define enclosed regions.
      - Can be simple (rectangle) or complex.
      - Can be connected to other boundaries or isolated.
  - Enclosed_Regions (Holes):
      - Composed of non-red pixels (white (0) or internal red (2)).
      - Identified by being disconnected from the grid's border when considering only non-red paths.
      - Property: Content - Can contain only white (0) pixels, or white (0) and red (2) pixels.
  - Internal_Red_Pixels:
      - Red (2) pixels located within an Enclosed_Region.
      - Not part of the main Red_Boundary defining that region.
Relationships:
  - Red_Boundaries enclose Enclosed_Regions.
  - Internal_Red_Pixels exist inside some Enclosed_Regions.
Actions:
  - Identify Enclosed_Regions: Find connected components of non-red pixels that do not touch the grid border.
  - Check Content: For each Enclosed_Region, determine if it contains any red (2) pixels from the input grid.
  - Conditional Fill: If an Enclosed_Region contains at least one red (2) pixel, change all white (0) pixels within that specific region to blue (1) in the output grid. Otherwise, leave the region unchanged.
