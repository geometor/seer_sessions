Task: Fill the gap between two aligned objects.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: A 2D array of pixels.
  - Background: The most frequent color in the grid.
  - Objects: Exactly two distinct, contiguous, monochromatic rectangular regions with colors different from the background.
    - Object_A:
      - color: C_A
      - bounding_box: (min_row_A, min_col_A, max_row_A, max_col_A)
    - Object_B:
      - color: C_B
      - bounding_box: (min_row_B, min_col_B, max_row_B, max_col_B)

Relationships:
  - Alignment: Objects A and B are either horizontally or vertically aligned.
    - Horizontal_Alignment:
      - Condition: Row ranges overlap (max(min_row_A, min_row_B) <= min(max_row_A, max_row_B)). Column ranges are separated (e.g., max_col_A < min_col_B).
      - Overlapping_Rows: max(min_row_A, min_row_B) to min(max_row_A, max_row_B).
      - Gap_Columns: (max_col_A + 1) to (min_col_B - 1). Let the object with smaller min_col be Left_Object, the other Right_Object.
      - Gap_Width: (Right_Object.min_col - 1) - (Left_Object.max_col + 1) + 1
    - Vertical_Alignment:
      - Condition: Column ranges overlap (max(min_col_A, min_col_B) <= min(max_col_A, max_col_B)). Row ranges are separated (e.g., max_row_A < min_row_B).
      - Overlapping_Columns: max(min_col_A, min_col_B) to min(max_col_A, max_col_B).
      - Gap_Rows: (max_row_A + 1) to (min_row_B - 1). Let the object with smaller min_row be Top_Object, the other Bottom_Object.
      - Gap_Height: (Bottom_Object.min_row - 1) - (Top_Object.max_row + 1) + 1

Transformation:
  - Action: Fill the gap between the two objects based on alignment.
  - Preserve: The original background and the original two objects remain unchanged.
  - Fill_Horizontal_Gap:
    - Region: Overlapping_Rows x Gap_Columns.
    - Left_Fill_Cols: From Left_Object.max_col + 1 to Left_Object.max_col + floor(Gap_Width / 2). Fill with Left_Object.color.
    - Right_Fill_Cols: From Right_Object.min_col - floor(Gap_Width / 2) to Right_Object.min_col - 1. Fill with Right_Object.color.
    - Note: If Gap_Width is odd, the middle column remains unfilled (background color).
  - Fill_Vertical_Gap:
    - Region: Gap_Rows x Overlapping_Columns.
    - Top_Fill_Rows: From Top_Object.max_row + 1 to Top_Object.max_row + ceil(Gap_Height / 2). Fill with Top_Object.color.
    - Bottom_Fill_Rows: From Bottom_Object.min_row - floor(Gap_Height / 2) to Bottom_Object.min_row - 1. Fill with Bottom_Object.color.
    - Note: If Gap_Height is odd, the middle row is filled by the Top_Object.

Output: The input grid modified by the fill actions.
