            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid contains a dominant background color. Embedded within this background are exactly two distinct, smaller, solid-colored rectangular objects.\n2.  **Object Colors:** The colors of the two objects are different from each other and different from the background color.\n3.  **Object Arrangement:** The two objects are separated by a region of the background color. They appear to be aligned either horizontally (sharing some rows, separated by columns) or vertically (sharing some columns, separated by rows).\n4.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is largely identical to the input grid, specifically regarding the background and the original positions of the two colored objects.\n5.  **Transformation:** The key transformation occurs in the background region *between* the two objects. This gap is filled with colors derived from the two objects.\n6.  **Filling Pattern (Horizontal):** When objects are horizontally aligned (left and right), the gap between them is filled. The portion of the gap closer to the left object takes the left object's color, and the portion closer to the right object takes the right object's color. If the gap width is even, it's split equally. If the gap width is odd (like in `train_2`), the exact middle column remains the background color.\n7.  **Filling Pattern (Vertical):** When objects are vertically aligned (top and bottom), the gap between them is filled. The portion of the gap closer to the top object takes the top object's color, and the portion closer to the bottom object takes the bottom object's color. If the gap height is odd (like in `train_3`), the middle row is filled with the *top* object's color (unlike the horizontal case where the middle is left empty). The split seems to be `ceil(height/2)` rows for the top object and `floor(height/2)` rows for the bottom object.\n8.  **Scope of Filling:** The filling occurs only within the rows (for horizontal alignment) or columns (for vertical alignment) where the original objects overlap.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
