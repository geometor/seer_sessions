task_description: Fill the gap between two aligned objects with their respective colors, extending across the grid.
background_color: Most frequent color in the input grid.
objects:
  - definition: Contiguous areas of pixels with the same non-background color.
  - count: Exactly two objects must be present.
  - properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels forming the object.
      - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing the object (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
alignment:
  - type: Horizontal or Vertical.
  - condition: The bounding boxes of the two objects must be separated only by background-colored pixels along one axis (columns for horizontal, rows for vertical). There must be a gap.
gap:
  - definition: The sequence of background-colored rows (for vertical alignment) or columns (for horizontal alignment) strictly between the bounding boxes of the two objects.
  - size: The number of rows (height) or columns (width) in the gap.
action:
  - name: fill_gap
  - inputs:
      - grid: The input grid.
      - object1: The first identified object.
      - object2: The second identified object.
      - gap_start: The starting row/column index of the gap.
      - gap_end: The ending row/column index of the gap.
      - gap_size: The height/width of the gap.
      - alignment_axis: 'horizontal' or 'vertical'.
  - logic:
      - Determine the extent of the fill from each object towards the center of the gap: `fill_count = gap_size // 2`.
      - If horizontally aligned (gap between left_obj and right_obj):
          - Fill `fill_count` columns starting from `gap_start_col` with `left_obj['color']` across all rows.
          - Fill `fill_count` columns ending at `gap_end_col` with `right_obj['color']` across all rows.
          - The middle column (`gap_start_col + fill_count`), if `gap_size` is odd, remains untouched (background color).
      - If vertically aligned (gap between top_obj and bottom_obj):
          - Fill `fill_count` rows starting from `gap_start_row` with `top_obj['color']` across all columns.
          - Fill `fill_count` rows ending at `gap_end_row` with `bottom_obj['color']` across all columns.
          - The middle row (`gap_start_row + fill_count`), if `gap_size` is odd, remains untouched (background color).
output: The modified grid with the gap filled according to the logic. If conditions (two objects, alignment, gap) are not met, return the original grid.
