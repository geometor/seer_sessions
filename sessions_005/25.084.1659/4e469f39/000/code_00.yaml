  - task_type: object_transformation_and_creation
  - grid_properties:
      - background_color: white (0)

      - type: gray_shape
        color: gray (5)
        description: Contiguous pixels forming U-shapes or incomplete rectangles, open on one vertical side (left or right).
        properties:
          - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle containing the shape.
          - top_row_index: The minimum row index touched by the shape.
          - opening_direction: The vertical side (left or right) that is missing gray pixels to fully enclose a rectangle.
          - cavity: The set of originally white (0) pixels located within the shape's bounding box.
      - type: red_fill
        color: red (2)
        description: Pixels created based on gray shapes.
        components:
          - filled_cavity: Red pixels replacing the white pixels in the cavity of a gray shape.
          - horizontal_beam: A horizontal line of red pixels.
  - relationships:
      - red_fill depends_on gray_shape
      - filled_cavity occupies the space defined by gray_shape's cavity
      - horizontal_beam:
          - row_position: Is always at `gray_shape.top_row_index - 1`.
          - horizontal_position_start: Aligns horizontally with the cavity columns.
          - extension_direction: Matches `gray_shape.opening_direction`.
          - extension_end: Continues to the grid boundary in the `extension_direction`.
  - actions:
      - Identify each distinct gray_shape.
      - For each gray_shape qualifying as a U-shape/incomplete rectangle:
          - Determine its bounding_box, top_row_index, opening_direction, and cavity.
          - Fill the cavity pixels with red (2).
          - Construct the horizontal_beam based on top_row_index, cavity columns, opening_direction, and grid boundaries.
          - Add the horizontal_beam pixels (color red 2) to the grid.
