            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input Grids:** The input grids contain a white background (0) and one or more objects made of gray pixels (5).\n2.  **Gray Objects:** These objects appear as hollow rectangular shapes, often missing one vertical side, resembling a 'U' rotated 0 or 180 degrees. They vary in size and position.\n3.  **Output Grids:** The output grids retain the original gray objects exactly as they were in the input. Additionally, areas of red pixels (2) appear, which were not present in the input.\n4.  **Red Pixel Formation:** The red pixels seem related to the gray objects.\n    *   Part of the red pixels fill the white space *inside* the bounds of the gray 'U' shapes. This includes the area directly enclosed and the space between the 'prongs' of the 'U'.\n    *   Another part of the red pixels forms a horizontal line segment. This line is located one row *above* the top-most row of the corresponding gray shape.\n    *   The horizontal line segment starts horizontally aligned with the filled cavity and extends outwards, away from the closed side of the 'U' shape, all the way to the edge of the grid. If the 'U' opens to the right, the line extends rightwards. If the 'U' opens to the left, the line extends leftwards.\n5.  **Multiple Objects:** When multiple gray 'U' shapes are present (as in `train_3`), the process is applied independently to each shape.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
