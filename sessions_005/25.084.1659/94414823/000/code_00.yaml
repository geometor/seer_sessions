task_elements:
  - object: frame
    type: static_structure
    properties:
      color: gray (5)
      shape: hollow square
      outer_dimensions: 6x6
      inner_dimensions: 4x4
      location: fixed, top-left corner at (2, 2)
    role: defines the area for transformation
  - object: signal_pixels
    type: dynamic_elements
    count: 2
    properties:
      color: non-white (0), non-gray (5), distinct from each other
      shape: single pixel
      location: variable, outside the frame
    role: provide the colors and determine the pattern for the transformation
relationships:
  - relation: relative_position
    between: [signal_pixel_1, signal_pixel_2]
    properties:
      - alignment: horizontal (same row) or vertical (same column)
      - vertical_side: if vertically aligned, whether the shared column is on the left (< grid_width / 2) or right (>= grid_width / 2) side of the grid.
      - top_bottom_order: one pixel can be designated 'top' (min row, then min col) and the other 'bottom'.
action:
  - type: fill_region
    target: interior of the frame (4x4 white area)
    details:
      - division: divide the 4x4 area into four 2x2 quadrants (TL, TR, BL, BR)
      - color_source: the colors of the two signal_pixels (C_top, C_bottom)
      - pattern_rule:
          condition: horizontal alignment OR (vertical alignment AND column < grid_width / 2)
          pattern_A: fill TL with C_top, TR with C_bottom, BL with C_bottom, BR with C_top
          condition: vertical alignment AND column >= grid_width / 2
          pattern_B: fill TL with C_bottom, TR with C_top, BL with C_top, BR with C_bottom
constants:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - frame_color: gray (5)
  - frame_location: (2, 2)
  - frame_size: 6x6 outer, 4x4 inner
