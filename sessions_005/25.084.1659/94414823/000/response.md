Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid contains a prominent hollow gray (5) square frame, 6x6 pixels externally and 4x4 pixels internally. This frame is consistently located starting at row 2, column 2. The area inside the frame is initially white (0).
2.  **Input Signal Pixels:** Outside this gray frame, there are exactly two non-white pixels. These two pixels always have different colors from each other and are single pixels (not part of larger objects). Their positions vary across the examples.
3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid retains the gray frame and the two external colored pixels in their original positions.
4.  **Transformation:** The key transformation happens within the 4x4 white area inside the gray frame. This 4x4 area is filled with a pattern composed of the two colors found outside the frame.
5.  **Pattern Details:** The 4x4 interior is divided into four 2x2 quadrants. Each quadrant is filled entirely with one of the two external colors. The specific arrangement of colors in the quadrants depends on the colors and relative positions of the two external pixels.
6.  **Pattern Logic:**
    *   Let the two external pixels be P1 and P2, with colors C1 and C2.
    *   Identify which pixel is "top" (P_top, C_top) based on the lowest row index (then lowest column index if rows are equal), and which is "bottom" (P_bottom, C_bottom).
    *   Determine if P_top and P_bottom are horizontally aligned (same row) or vertically aligned (same column). The examples only show these two alignment types.
    *   Two distinct filling patterns emerge for the 2x2 quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right):
        *   **Pattern A:** TL=C_top, TR=C_bottom, BL=C_bottom, BR=C_top
        *   **Pattern B:** TL=C_bottom, TR=C_top, BL=C_top, BR=C_bottom
    *   The choice between Pattern A and Pattern B depends on the alignment:
        *   If horizontally aligned, use Pattern A.
        *   If vertically aligned:
            *   If the shared column index is less than half the grid width, use Pattern A.
            *   If the shared column index is greater than or equal to half the grid width, use Pattern B.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the 6x6 gray frame structure, typically located starting at row 2, column 2. Note the 4x4 white interior region within this frame.
2.  Scan the grid outside the gray frame to find the two non-white, non-gray pixels. Record their colors (Color1, Color2) and positions (Row1, Col1; Row2, Col2).
3.  Designate one pixel as `P_top` (Color `C_top`, Row `R_top`, Col `C_top`) and the other as `P_bottom` (Color `C_bottom`, Row `R_bottom`, Col `C_bottom`). `P_top` is the pixel with the smaller row index; if row indices are equal, it's the one with the smaller column index.
4.  Check if the pixels are vertically aligned (`C_top == C_bottom`).
5.  If they are vertically aligned:
    a.  Determine the grid width.
    b.  Check if the shared column index (`C_top`) is less than half the grid width.
    c.  If `C_top < grid_width / 2`: Use **Pattern A**. Fill the top-left 2x2 quadrant with `C_top`, the top-right with `C_bottom`, the bottom-left with `C_bottom`, and the bottom-right with `C_top`.
    d.  If `C_top >= grid_width / 2`: Use **Pattern B**. Fill the top-left 2x2 quadrant with `C_bottom`, the top-right with `C_top`, the bottom-left with `C_top`, and the bottom-right with `C_bottom`.
6.  If they are not vertically aligned (implying horizontal alignment, `R_top == R_bottom`, based on examples): Use **Pattern A**. Fill the top-left 2x2 quadrant with `C_top`, the top-right with `C_bottom`, the bottom-left with `C_bottom`, and the bottom-right with `C_top`.
7.  Leave the gray frame and the two external signal pixels unchanged. The rest of the grid remains white.
