            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input & Output Grids:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9. The grids vary in size between examples.\n2.  **Colors Used:** The key colors observed are:\n    *   White (0): Appears as background or areas within structures.\n    *   Gray (5): Forms structures or boundaries within the grid.\n    *   Orange (7): Appears in the output grid, replacing some white pixels.\n    *   Azure (8): Appears in the output grid, replacing some white pixels.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The fundamental change is the filling of certain white (0) areas in the input grid with either orange (7) or azure (8) in the output grid. Gray (5) pixels remain unchanged.\n4.  **Spatial Relationship:** The white areas that get filled appear to be enclosed or bounded by gray (5) pixels and potentially the grid edges, but critically, they do not touch the grid's outer border. White areas that *do* touch the outer border remain white.\n5.  **Fill Color Determinant:** The choice between orange (7) and azure (8) for filling seems related to the size (number of pixels) of the enclosed white area. Smaller enclosed areas are filled with orange, while larger ones are filled with azure.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
