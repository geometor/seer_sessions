Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input & Output Grids:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9. The grids vary in size between examples.
2.  **Colors Used:** The key colors observed are:
    *   White (0): Appears as background or areas within structures.
    *   Gray (5): Forms structures or boundaries within the grid.
    *   Orange (7): Appears in the output grid, replacing some white pixels.
    *   Azure (8): Appears in the output grid, replacing some white pixels.
3.  **Core Transformation:** The fundamental change is the filling of certain white (0) areas in the input grid with either orange (7) or azure (8) in the output grid. Gray (5) pixels remain unchanged.
4.  **Spatial Relationship:** The white areas that get filled appear to be enclosed or bounded by gray (5) pixels and potentially the grid edges, but critically, they do not touch the grid's outer border. White areas that *do* touch the outer border remain white.
5.  **Fill Color Determinant:** The choice between orange (7) and azure (8) for filling seems related to the size (number of pixels) of the enclosed white area. Smaller enclosed areas are filled with orange, while larger ones are filled with azure.

    description: Count the number of pixels in the white region.
  - action: determine_fill_color
    input: region_size
    output: fill_color
    condition: Based on a size threshold (<= 4 -> orange, > 4 -> azure).

    description: Change the color of all pixels within the specified region in the output grid to the fill color.
relationships:
  - relationship: enclosure
    between: region_white, color_gray
    description: Gray pixels form boundaries that enclose some white regions.
  - relationship: boundary_contact
    between: region_white, grid_border
    description: A white region may or may not touch the outer border of the grid.
transformation_logic:
  - step: Copy input grid to output grid.
  - step: Find all connected white regions in the input grid.
  - step: For each white region:
    - if the region does not touch the grid border:
      - measure the size of the region.
      - if size <= 4:
        - fill the region in the output grid with orange (7).
      - else (size > 4):
        - fill the region in the output grid with azure (8).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous regions composed entirely of white (0) pixels. Consider pixels connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally) as part of the same region.
3.  For each identified white region:
    a.  Check if any pixel within that region is located on the outermost border of the grid (the first or last row, or the first or last column).
    b.  If the white region does **not** touch the grid border:
        i.  Count the total number of pixels in this enclosed white region. Let this count be `size`.
        ii. If `size` is less than or equal to 4, change the color of all pixels in this region to orange (7).
        iii. If `size` is greater than 4, change the color of all pixels in this region to azure (8).
4.  Leave all other pixels (gray pixels and white pixels in regions that touch the border) unchanged from their original color in the input grid.
5.  The resulting grid is the output.
