task_description: Fill enclosed white regions based on size, distinguishing between small and large regions.
elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors. Size varies.
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer from 0-9.
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
  - element: color_white
    value: 0
    role: Background or fillable regions.
  - element: color_gray
    value: 5
    role: Structural elements forming boundaries.
  - element: color_orange
    value: 7
    role: Fill color for small enclosed white regions in the output.
  - element: color_azure
    value: 8
    role: Fill color for large enclosed white regions in the output.
  - element: region_white
    description: A connected component of white pixels (using 4-connectivity).
    properties:
      - size: Number of pixels in the component.
      - touches_border: Boolean indicating if any pixel in the component is on the grid's outer edge.
      - enclosed: Boolean, true if touches_border is false.
actions:
  - action: identify_regions
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_white_regions
    description: Find all connected components of white (0) pixels using 4-connectivity.
  - action: check_boundary
    input: white_region
    input: grid_dimensions
    output: touches_border_flag
    description: Determine if a white region contains any pixel located at row 0, last_row, column 0, or last_column.
  - action: measure_size
    input: white_region
    output: region_size
    description: Count the number of pixels in the white region.
  - action: determine_fill_color
    input: region_size
    output: fill_color
    condition: Based on a size threshold (<= 4 -> orange, > 4 -> azure).
    description: Assign orange (7) or azure (8) based on the size of the enclosed region.
  - action: fill_region
    input: output_grid
    input: white_region
    input: fill_color
    output: modified_output_grid
    description: Change the color of all pixels within the specified region in the output grid to the fill color.
relationships:
  - relationship: enclosure
    between: region_white, color_gray
    description: Gray pixels form boundaries that enclose some white regions.
  - relationship: boundary_contact
    between: region_white, grid_border
    description: A white region may or may not touch the outer border of the grid.
transformation_logic:
  - step: Copy input grid to output grid.
  - step: Find all connected white regions in the input grid.
  - step: For each white region:
    - if the region does not touch the grid border:
      - measure the size of the region.
      - if size <= 4:
        - fill the region in the output grid with orange (7).
      - else (size > 4):
        - fill the region in the output grid with azure (8).
