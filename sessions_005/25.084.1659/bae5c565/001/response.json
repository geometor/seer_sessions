Identify the background color (most frequent color, excluding the first row).\n3. Locate the single vertical line present in the input grid (distinct from the background), recording its color, column index, start row, and end row.\n4. Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.\n5. Starting one row below the vertical line's start row, paint a V-shaped pattern onto the output grid.\n6. This pattern uses colors from the first-row sequence, centered horizontally on the vertical line's column.\n7. The width of the painted segment increases by two pixels for each subsequent row downwards.\n8. The painting continues for floor(sequence_length / 2) rows.\n9. At the central column (the original vertical line's column), the vertical line's original color overrides the sequence color during painting.\n10. After the V-pattern is complete, if the original vertical line extended further down, copy the last painted row's pattern into all subsequent rows down to the original end row of the vertical line.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _find_background_color(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds the most frequent color in the grid, assumed to be the background.\"\"\"\n    # Exclude the first row if it's distinctly the sequence\n    if grid.shape[0] > 1:\n        counts = Counter(grid[1:].flatten())\n    else:\n        counts = Counter(grid.flatten())\n        \n    if not counts: # Handle empty or 1-row grid edge case\n         if grid.size > 0:\n             return grid[0,0] # Best guess\n         else:\n             return 0 # Default to white/black if grid is empty\n\n    # Find the most common color, often the background\n    background_color = counts.most_common(1)[0][0]\n    return background_color\n\ndef _find_vertical_line(grid, background_color):\n    \"\"\"Finds the properties of the single vertical line.\"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    \n    for c in range(width):\n        line_color = -1\n        start_row = -1\n        end_row = -1\n        in_line = False\n        possible_line = True\n        \n        for r in range(height):\n            pixel_color = grid[r, c]\n            \n            # Ignore the sequence row for finding the line itself\n            if r == 0: \n                continue\n\n            if pixel_color != background_color:\n                if not in_line:\n                    # Starting a potential line segment\n                    if line_color == -1:\n                        line_color = pixel_color\n                        start_row = r\n                        end_row = r\n                        in_line = True\n                    else:\n                        # Found a different color in the same column, not a single line\n                        possible_line = False\n                        break\n                elif pixel_color == line_color:\n                    # Continuing the line segment\n                    end_row = r\n                else:\n                    # Found a different color after the line started, not a single line\n                    possible_line = False\n                    break\n            elif in_line:\n                # Found background color after line started, line segment ended\n                in_line = False \n                # If we find non-background later in this column, it's not a single line\n                # We can continue scanning just in case, but mark as potential failure if needed\n                \n        # After checking all rows in column c:\n        if possible_line and line_color != -1 and start_row > 0: # Ensure line isn't just in row 0\n             # Check if it's truly vertical (only this column has this color pattern)\n             # This check might be overly strict for some ARC tasks, but fits these examples.\n             is_unique_line = True\n             for other_c in range(width):\n                 if other_c == c: continue\n                 for r in range(start_row, end_row + 1):\n                     if grid[r, other_c] == line_color:\n                         # Found the same color elsewhere in the line's height range\n                         # Let's be more lenient: is it part of another VERTICAL line of the same color?\n                         # For this specific task, assume the line is unique.\n                         pass # Simpler assumption based on examples.\n\n             if is_unique_line:\n                return line_color, c, start_row, end_row\n\n    # Should not happen based on task description/examples\n    raise ValueError(\"Vertical line not found\")\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    height, width = input_grid.shape\n\n    # 1.
