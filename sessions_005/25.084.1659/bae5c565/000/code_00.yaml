task_context:
  description: "Paint a sequence from the first row onto the grid, centered on a vertical line."
  grid_size_invariant: true # Input and output grids have the same dimensions.

elements:
  - element: sequence
    description: "The pattern of colors found in the first row of the input grid."
    properties:
      location: first row (row 0)
      length: equals grid width
  - element: background
    description: "The predominant color in the input grid, excluding the sequence and the vertical line."
    properties:
      color: gray (5) in examples
      role: fills the output grid initially and areas not covered by the painted pattern.
  - element: vertical_line
    description: "A single column of contiguous pixels with a distinct color."
    properties:
      color: azure (8) in examples
      orientation: vertical
      location: defined by a column index (C), start row (R_start), and end row (R_end).
      role: acts as the center axis for the painted pattern and its color persists in the output.
  - element: painted_pattern
    description: "A V-shaped or triangular pattern in the output grid."
    properties:
      shape: triangular/V-shape, expanding downwards.
      color_source: the 'sequence' element.
      center_column: same as 'vertical_line' column index (C).
      vertical_extent: starts at R_start + 1, ends determined by sequence length/grid width.
      color_override: pixels at column C retain the 'vertical_line' color.
  - element: copied_rows
    description: "Rows below the main painted pattern in the output."
    properties:
      content: identical copies of the last row of the 'painted_pattern'.
      vertical_extent: from the row below the 'painted_pattern' down to the original 'vertical_line' end row (R_end).

relationships:
  - relationship: centering
    description: "The 'painted_pattern' is horizontally centered on the column of the 'vertical_line'."
  - relationship: source
    description: "The colors within the 'painted_pattern' are derived from the 'sequence'."
  - relationship: override
    description: "The color of the 'vertical_line' overrides the 'sequence' color at the central column within the 'painted_pattern'."
  - relationship: propagation
    description: "The bottom-most row pattern of the 'painted_pattern' is propagated downwards to fill the remaining original extent of the 'vertical_line'."
  - relationship: positioning
    description: "The top of the 'painted_pattern' starts one row below the top of the 'vertical_line'."

actions:
  - action: identify_elements
    description: "Locate the sequence, background color, and vertical line (color, column, start/end rows) in the input."
  - action: initialize_output
    description: "Create an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color."
  - action: paint_pattern
    description: >
      Iteratively apply segments of the sequence to the output grid, row by row,
      starting from row R_start + 1. The segment width increases by 2 each row,
      centered at column C. The color at column C is forced to the vertical_line color.
      The painting stops after floor(sequence_length / 2) rows.
  - action: copy_last_row
    description: >
      Copy the content of the last row painted in the previous step to all subsequent rows
      up to and including the original end row (R_end) of the vertical line.
