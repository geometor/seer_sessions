            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this ARC task.\n\n### Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grid consists of two main components:\n    *   A sequence of colors located in the first row.\n    *   A mostly uniform background (gray) with a single vertical line of a distinct color (azure) embedded within it.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains the background color. The vertical azure line from the input persists, often appearing widened or as part of a larger pattern. The color sequence from the input's first row is \"painted\" or \"stamped\" onto the output grid, forming a V-shape or triangular pattern centered horizontally on the original azure line's column. This pattern starts below the original top of the azure line and extends downwards. The rows below the main painted pattern, down to the original bottom extent of the azure line, replicate the pattern of the last fully painted row.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves using the first-row sequence as a \"palette\" or \"stencil\" that is applied row by row in an expanding pattern, centered on the azure line's column. The painting starts one row below the original start of the azure line. The width of the applied sequence segment increases by two pixels for each row downwards, reaching the full sequence width. The original azure line's color overrides the sequence color at its specific column index during the painting process. Finally, the pattern from the last painted row is copied downwards to fill the remaining rows originally occupied by the azure line.\n\n### Facts\n\n"

Ensure `R_paint_end` does not exceed grid boundaries.\n4.  **Paint the Pattern:** Iterate through the rows from `r = R_paint_start` to `R_paint_end`:\n    *   Calculate the width `w` of the sequence segment to paint on this row: `w = W - 2 * (R_paint_end - r)`.\n    *   Calculate the starting column `c_start = C - floor(w / 2)`.\n    *   Calculate the ending column `c_end = C + floor(w / 2)`.\n    *   For each column `c` from `c_start` to `c_end`:\n        *   Determine the corresponding index `s_idx` in the original sequence `S`: `s_idx = c`.\n        *   Get the color `color_from_sequence = S[s_idx]`.\n        *   If the current column `c` is the central column `C`, set `output_grid[r, c] = C_line`.\n        *   Otherwise, set `output_grid[r, c] = color_from_sequence`.\n5.  **Copy Last Row:**\n    *   If `R_paint_end` is less than `R_end` (meaning the original azure line extended below the painted triangle):\n        *   Get the pattern of the last painted row: `last_painted_row_pattern = output_grid[R_paint_end]`.\n        *   Iterate through the rows from `r = R_paint_end + 1` to `R_end`:\n            *   Set `output_grid[r] = last_painted_row_pattern`.\n6.  **Return Output:** The final `output_grid` is the result."
