            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grids:** The task operates on 2D grids of pixels, with dimensions 10x10 in all training examples.\n2.  **Colors:** The significant colors are:\n    *   White (0): Appears as the background and the color used *above* the red boundary in the output.\n    *   Red (2): Forms a distinct shape or line in each input grid. This shape is preserved in the output.\n    *   Other Colors (Blue (1), Gray (5), Azure (8)): These appear in the input grids. One of these colors becomes the \"fill color\" *below* the red boundary in the output.\n3.  **Red Boundary:** The red pixels (color 2) seem to define a boundary or a separator within the grid. The location and shape of this boundary vary between examples (horizontal line, fragmented line, diagonal band).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves partitioning the grid based on the red boundary and filling the regions above and below it with specific colors, while preserving the red boundary itself.\n5.  **Fill Logic:**\n    *   The area *above* the lowest red pixel in each column is consistently filled with white (0).\n    *   The area *at and below* the lowest red pixel in each column is filled with a specific color (the \"fill color\").\n    *   The \"fill color\" appears to be derived from the input grid. Observing the examples, it's the most frequent color in the input *excluding* white (0) and red (2).\n        *   Example 1: Blue (1) is most frequent (excluding 0, 2). Output below red is blue (1).\n        *   Example 2: Gray (5) is most frequent (excluding 0, 2, tied with white but gray is chosen). Output below red is gray (5).\n        *   Example 3: Azure (8) is most frequent (excluding 0, 2). Output below red is azure (8).\n    *   Columns containing no red pixels become entirely white (0) in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Designate this color as the \"fill color\".\n2.  Create a new grid (the output grid) with the same dimensions as the input grid, and initialize all its pixels to white (color 0).\n3.  Process the input grid column by column:\n    a.  For the current column, search downwards from the top row to find the row index of the lowest pixel that has the red color (2).\n    b.  If a red pixel is found in this column at `lowest_red_row`:\n        i.  Iterate through all rows `r` from `lowest_red_row` down to the last row of the grid.\n        ii. Set the pixel in the output grid at position (`r`, current column) to the \"fill color\" determined in step 1.\n    c.  If no red pixel is found in the current column, proceed to the next column (the column remains white in the output grid as initialized).\n4.  After processing all columns as described in step 3, iterate through the entire input grid one more time. For every pixel in the input grid that is red (color 2), set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to red (color 2). This ensures the original red boundary is perfectly preserved in the final output.\n5.  The resulting grid is the final output."
