Transformation Rule:
1. Analyze the input grid to find the most frequent pixel color, excluding white (color 0) and red (color 2). This color is the "fill color".
2. Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (color 0).
3. For each column in the input grid:
   a. Find the row index of the lowest red (color 2) pixel.
   b. If a red pixel exists in the column, fill the corresponding column in the output grid from that lowest red row index down to the bottom with the "fill color".
4. Iterate through the input grid again. If a pixel in the input is red (color 2), set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to red (color 2). This preserves the original red boundary.
