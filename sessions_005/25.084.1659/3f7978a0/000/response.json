            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Colors:** Both input and output grids primarily use white (0), gray (5), and azure (8) pixels.\n2.  **Grid Size:** The output grid is consistently smaller than the input grid.\n3.  **Key Feature - Gray Pixels:** The gray (5) pixels in the input appear crucial. They seem to form vertical structures, often pairs of lines or segments.\n4.  **Key Feature - Azure Pixels:** Azure (8) pixels are also present, often appearing near the gray structures or scattered elsewhere.\n5.  **Transformation:** The output seems to be a cropped section of the input grid. The cropping region appears centered around the gray pixels.\n6.  **Bounding Box:** Let's consider the bounding box containing *only* the gray (5) pixels in the input.\n    *   Example 1: Gray pixels are in rows 4-6, columns 2-8. BBox height=3, width=7. Output is 5x7.\n    *   Example 2: Gray pixels are in rows 2-4, columns 1-5. BBox height=3, width=5. Output is 5x5.\n    *   Example 3: Gray pixels are in rows 3-6, columns 3-7. BBox height=4, width=5. Output is 6x5.\n7.  **Pattern:** The output width matches the width of the gray pixel bounding box (`max_col_gray - min_col_gray + 1`). The output height is consistently 2 rows larger than the height of the gray pixel bounding box (`max_row_gray - min_row_gray + 1 + 2`).\n8.  **Cropping Rule:** The output appears to be the subgrid extracted from the input using the column range defined by the gray bounding box (`min_col_gray` to `max_col_gray`) and a row range expanded by one row above and one row below the gray bounding box (`min_row_gray - 1` to `max_row_gray + 1`).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
