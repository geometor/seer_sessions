task_elements:
  - item: grids
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of pixels with colors 0 (white), 5 (gray), and 8 (azure).
  - item: gray_pixels
    properties:
      - color_value: 5
      - role: Defines the core region of interest for the transformation.
    relationships:
      - determines the column boundaries of the output grid.
      - determines the central rows of the output grid region.
  - item: azure_pixels
    properties:
      - color_value: 8
    relationships:
      - They are included in the output if they fall within the extracted region defined by the gray pixels.
  - item: white_pixels
    properties:
      - color_value: 0
      - role: Background color.
    relationships:
      - They are included in the output if they fall within the extracted region.
transformation:
  - action: identify_gray_pixels
    input: input_grid
    output: coordinates of all gray (5) pixels.
  - action: calculate_gray_bounding_box
    input: coordinates of gray pixels
    output: min_row_gray, max_row_gray, min_col_gray, max_col_gray
    description: Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices containing gray pixels.
  - action: determine_output_boundaries
    input: min_row_gray, max_row_gray, min_col_gray, max_col_gray
    output: start_row, end_row, start_col, end_col
    logic:
      - start_row = min_row_gray - 1
      - end_row = max_row_gray + 1
      - start_col = min_col_gray
      - end_col = max_col_gray
  - action: extract_subgrid
    input: input_grid, start_row, end_row, start_col, end_col
    output: output_grid
    description: Select the portion of the input grid defined by the calculated row and column boundaries.
output_characteristics:
  - property: width
    derivation: max_col_gray - min_col_gray + 1
  - property: height
    derivation: (max_row_gray - min_row_gray + 1) + 2
  - property: content
    derivation: A direct sub-section of the input grid based on the expanded gray bounding box.
