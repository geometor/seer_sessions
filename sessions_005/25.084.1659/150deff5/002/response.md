Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.

## General Assessment

The previous code attempted to solve the task by counting the non-diagonal gray neighbors for each gray pixel. It assigned red (2) if the count was 1 and azure (8) if the count was 2 or more. The results show this rule is incorrect, as the transformed outputs do not match the expected outputs for any of the training examples.

The mismatches indicate that the simple non-diagonal neighbor count is not the determining factor. Pixels with 2 or 3 neighbors sometimes become red (2) in the expected output, while the code consistently makes them azure (8).

**Strategy:**
1.  Analyze the specific locations where the code's output differs from the expected output in each example.
2.  Re-examine the input and expected output grids, looking for a different local property or pattern associated with gray pixels that determines whether they become red (2) or azure (8).
3.  Formulate a new hypothesis based on these observations. A potential pattern noticed is that azure (8) pixels seem to belong to "thicker" areas (like 2x2 blocks or larger), while red (2) pixels belong to "thinner" areas (1-pixel wide lines or endpoints).
4.  Test the new hypothesis against all training examples.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's quantify the differences for each example. We'll compare the `Expected Output` and the `Transformed Output` provided in the prompt.
