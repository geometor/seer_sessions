Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid contains a single connected object composed of gray (5) pixels against a white (0) background. The shape and size of the gray object vary across the examples.
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** Each output grid retains the exact shape and position of the object from the corresponding input grid. The background remains white (0). However, the gray (5) pixels within the object are replaced by either red (2) or azure (8) pixels.
3.  **Color Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the gray pixels based on their local context within the gray object.
4.  **Neighborhood Analysis:** Comparing input and output grids, it appears the color change depends on the number of adjacent gray neighbors for each gray pixel. Let's focus on non-diagonal neighbors (up, down, left, right).
    *   In `train_1`, gray pixels that seem to be at the "ends" or "corners" of branches (having only one non-diagonal gray neighbor) become red (2).
    *   Gray pixels that are "internal" to the shape (having two or more non-diagonal gray neighbors) become azure (8).
5.  **Hypothesis Verification:** This pattern holds across all three training examples. For instance, in `train_2`, the gray pixel at (row=3, col=3) has only one gray neighbor (at (3,4)) and becomes red (2). The gray pixel at (row=3, col=4) has two gray neighbors (at (3,3) and (3,5)) and becomes azure (8).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with white (0).
2.  Iterate through each pixel (cell) of the input grid using its row and column index.
3.  If the current input pixel is gray (5):
    a.  Check its four non-diagonal neighbors (up, down, left, right), staying within the grid boundaries.
    b.  Count how many of these non-diagonal neighbors are also gray (5).
    c.  If the count of gray non-diagonal neighbors is exactly 1, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to red (2).
    d.  If the count of gray non-diagonal neighbors is 2 or more, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to azure (8).
4.  If the current input pixel is white (0), the corresponding pixel in the output grid remains white (0) (as initialized).
5.  Return the completed output grid.
