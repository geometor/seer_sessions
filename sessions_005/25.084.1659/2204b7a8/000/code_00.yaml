task_description: Modify the color of specific pixels based on their proximity to colored borders.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - size: constant 10x10 in examples, but potentially variable.
      - background: primarily white (0).
  - type: border
    properties:
      - orientation: either "horizontal" (top and bottom rows) or "vertical" (left and right columns).
      - uniformity: each border line (row or column) consists of a single, non-white color.
      - colors: two distinct colors define the borders (e.g., top_color, bottom_color or left_color, right_color).
  - type: target_pixel
    properties:
      - color: green (3).
      - location: positioned within the grid, not on the borders themselves.

actions:
  - name: identify_borders
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: border_type ("horizontal" or "vertical"), border_colors (pair of colors)
    description: Check if top/bottom rows or left/right columns are uniform non-white colors.
  - name: measure_distance
    inputs: pixel_coordinates (row, col), border_type
    outputs: distance_to_first_border, distance_to_second_border
    description: Calculate orthogonal distance from the pixel to the relevant borders.
  - name: change_color
    inputs: pixel_coordinates (row, col), distances, border_colors
    outputs: modified_pixel_color
    description: Change the green pixel's color to the color of the nearest border.

relationships:
  - The transformation rule depends on the type of border present (horizontal or vertical).
  - The final color of a target pixel is determined by its relative orthogonal distance to the two identified borders.
  - Pixels that are not green (3) or are part of the borders are unaffected.

assumptions:
  - Only one type of border (horizontal or vertical) will be present in a valid input.
  - If a green pixel is exactly equidistant between the two borders, it defaults to the color of the top border (for horizontal) or the left border (for vertical). (Note: This is an assumption as no equidistant examples were provided).
