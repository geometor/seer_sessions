            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 10x10 grids.\n2.  **Key Colors:** The transformation seems to primarily involve green pixels (color 3) changing color. The grids also feature distinct border colors.\n3.  **Border Patterns:**\n    *   Example 1: The top row is entirely yellow (4), and the bottom row is entirely orange (7).\n    *   Example 2: The leftmost column is entirely blue (1), and the rightmost column is entirely red (2).\n    *   Example 3: The top row is entirely azure (8), and the bottom row is entirely maroon (9).\n    *   It appears each grid has either uniform horizontal borders (top/bottom) or uniform vertical borders (left/right), but not both. These borders are non-white (color 0).\n4.  **Transformation Focus:** Only the green (3) pixels located *between* the identified borders change color. The borders themselves and any other pixels remain unchanged.\n5.  **Color Change Logic:** The new color assigned to a green pixel seems to depend on its proximity to the two borders.\n    *   In Example 1 (horizontal borders), green pixels closer to the top yellow border become yellow, and those closer to the bottom orange border become orange.\n    *   In Example 2 (vertical borders), green pixels closer to the left blue border become blue, and those closer to the right red border become red.\n    *   In Example 3 (horizontal borders), green pixels closer to the top azure border become azure, and those closer to the bottom maroon border become maroon.\n    *   The distance appears to be measured orthogonally (vertically for horizontal borders, horizontally for vertical borders).\n6.  **Tie-Breaking:** In the provided examples, no green pixel is exactly equidistant from the two relevant borders. The rule seems to be based on which border is strictly closer. If a pixel were equidistant, a default rule might apply (e.g., defaulting to the top or left border), but this isn't explicitly demonstrated.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
