C = {8, 5, 9, 4}.\nP_char comes from B1 (pixel 8, index k=0) and B4 (pixel 4, index k=3).\nThe pixel corresponding to the highest index k is 4 (from k=3).\nPredicted output: 4. Actual output: 4. Works for this case!\n\nLet's test this refined hypothesis:\nRule:\n1. Find blocks B1..B4.\n2. Find characteristic colors C1..C4 (most freq non-zero in each block). Let C = {C1, C2, C3, C4}.\n3. For each (r, c):\n   a. Get pixels P = (B1[r,c], ..., B4[r,c]).\n   b. Find matching indices `K_match = {k | P[k] in C}`. (k is 0-based index).\n   c. If `K_match` is empty, `Output[r, c] = 0`.\n   d. If `K_match` is not empty, find `k* = max(K_match)`.\n   e. `Output[r, c] = P[k*]` (which is `B(k*+1)[r, c]`).\n\nTest on T1: C = {8, 5, 9, 4}.\n- (0,0): P=(0, 5, 9, 4). K_match={1(5 in C), 2(9 in C), 3(4 in C)}. k*=max(1,2,3)=3. Output=P[3]=4. Actual 9. Fails.\n\n---\n\nWhat if the characteristic colors are determined differently?\nMaybe Ck is just the color of the top-left pixel of Bk?\nT1: C1=0, C2=5, C3=9, C4=4. C = {0, 5, 9, 4}.\nRule: Find `k* = max({k | P[k] in C})`. Output `P[k*]`. If no match, output 0.\n\nTest on T1: C = {0, 5, 9, 4}.\n- (0,0): P=(0, 5, 9, 4). K_match={0(0 in C), 1(5 in C), 2(9 in C), 3(4 in C)}. k*=max(0,1,2,3)=3. Output=P[3]=4. Actual 9. Fails.\n\n---\n\nMaybe the selection rule is fixed? Output[r,c] = Bk[r,c] where k depends only on r,c?\nT1 Map (Inferred which block the output pixel came from):\n"
