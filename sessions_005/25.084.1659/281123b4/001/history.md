Characteristic colors confirmed: C1=8, C2=5, C3=9, C4=4. (Assuming `np.int64` behaves like `int`).

Let's redo the check for Rule attempt 2 with the tie-breaker: "Select the block `Bk` from `S = {Bk | Bk[r, c] == Ck}`. If `|S| > 1`, choose the `Bk` where `k` is highest."

T1, Output:

```
9 0 8 9
9 9 4 9
9 9 8 0
4 4 4 0
```


- `Output[0,0] = 9`. Pixels (0, 5, 9, 4). Matches: B2(5==C2), B3(9==C3), B4(4==C4). Indices {1, 2, 3}. Max index is 3 (B4). Predicted output: B4[0,0] = 4. Actual output: 9. Rule Fails.

Let's try tie-breaker: "Select the block `Bk` from `S` where `k` is lowest."
- `Output[0,0] = 9`. Matches B2, B3, B4. Indices {1, 2, 3}. Min index is 1 (B2). Predicted output: B2[0,0] = 5. Actual output: 9. Rule Fails.

Let's try tie-breaker: "Select the block `Bk` from `S` where `Ck` is highest."
- `Output[0,0] = 9`. Matches B2, B3, B4. Char colors {5, 9, 4}. Max color is 9 (C3). Block is B3. Predicted output: B3[0,0] = 9. Actual output: 9. Works.
- `Output[1,2] = 4`. Pixels (8, 0, 0, 4). Matches B1(8==C1), B4(4==C4). Char colors {8, 4}. Max color is 8 (C1). Block is B1. Predicted output: B1[1,2] = 8. Actual output: 4. Rule Fails.

Let's try tie-breaker: "Select the block `Bk` from `S` where `Ck` is lowest."
- `Output[0,0] = 9`. Matches B2, B3, B4. Char colors {5, 9, 4}. Min color is 4 (C4). Block is B4. Predicted output: B4[0,0] = 4. Actual output: 9. Rule Fails.

---

Maybe the characteristic color definition is wrong? What if it's just the *first* non-zero color encountered when scanning the block? Unlikely for ARC. What if it's the color with the absolute highest count, even if it's zero (background)?
T1 B1: 8(9), 0(7) -> 8
T1 B2: 0(9), 5(7) -> 0
T1 B3: 0(9), 9(7) -> 0
T1 B4: 4(8), 0(8) -> Tie? Let's say 4 based on value.
New char colors: C1=8, C2=0, C3=0, C4=4.

Let's test the "highest characteristic color" tie-breaker with these new char colors.
Rule: `Output[r, c] = Bk[r, c]` where `Bk[r, c] == Ck`. If multiple matches, pick one with highest `Ck`. If no match, output 0.

T1, Output[0,0] = 9. Pixels (0, 5, 9, 4). Char colors (8, 0, 0, 4).
Matches: B2(5!=0), B3(9!=0), B4(4==4). Match B4. Predicted output: B4[0,0] = 4. Actual: 9. Fails.

---

Back to the original characteristic colors: C1=8, C2=5, C3=9, C4=4.
Rule: `Output[r, c] = Bk[r, c]` where `Bk[r, c] == Ck`. Tie-breaker needed. No match -> output 0.

Let's re-examine T1, Output[1,2]=4.
Pixels (8, 0, 0, 4). Matches B1(8==C1) and B4(4==C4). Output is 4 (from B4).
Why B4 over B1?
Maybe the tie-breaker depends on the *position* (r, c)?

Consider the output grid `O`. For each `O[r, c]`, we need to select a block index `k`.
`k = f(r, c)`?

Let's map which block was selected for each position in T1 (where unambiguous or inferred from rule):
Recall: B1(C1=8), B2(C2=5), B3(C3=9), B4(C4=4)
Rule: Select `Bk` such that `Bk[r, c] == Ck`. If no match, use 0. If multiple matches, TBD.

Output T1:

```
9 0 8 9  -> B3, ?, B1, B3
9 9 4 9  -> B3, B3, B4, B3  (Pixels(1,2)=(8,0,0,4). Matches B1,B4. Output 4. From B4)
9 9 8 0  -> B3, B3, B1, ?  (Pixels(2,2)=(8,0,0,0). Match B1. Output 8. From B1)
4 4 4 0  -> B4, B4, B4, ?  (Pixels(3,0)=(8,0,0,4). Matches B1,B4. Output 4. From B4)
```

Let's fill in the ambiguous '0' outputs based on surrounding selections if possible (weak assumption). Seems unlikely. Let's assume '0' results from the "no match" case.
Pixels(0,1) = (0,0,0,0). No match. Output 0. Correct.
Pixels(2,3) = (0,5,0,0). Match B2(5==C2). Output B2[2,3]=5. Actual output is 0. Fails.
Pixels(3,3) = (0,0,0,0). No match. Output 0. Correct.

There's a contradiction at (2,3). Pixels=(0,5,0,0). Only match is B2 (5==C2). Rule predicts Output = B2[2,3] = 5. Actual Output = 0.

This means the rule "Output[r,c] = Bk[r,c] where Bk[r,c] == Ck" is fundamentally flawed or incomplete.

---

Maybe the logic doesn't involve matching the pixel value to the characteristic color?

What if we just select the block based on some other property?

Consider the values (8, 5, 9, 4). These are the characteristic colors.
Could the output be constructed based on which of these colors appears at `Bk[r, c]`?

Let `P(r,c) = { B1[r,c], B2[r,c], B3[r,c], B4[r,c] }` be the set of pixels at position (r,c) in the four blocks.
Let `C = {C1, C2, C3, C4} = {8, 5, 9, 4}` be the set of characteristic colors.

Consider T1, Output[0,0]=9. P(0,0) = {0, 5, 9, 4}. Intersection `P(0,0) intersect C = {5, 9, 4}`. Output is 9. Max of intersection?
Consider T1, Output[1,2]=4. P(1,2) = {8, 0, 0, 4}. Intersection `P(1,2) intersect C = {8, 4}`. Output is 4. Min of intersection?
Consider T1, Output[2,3]=0. P(2,3) = {0, 5, 0, 0}. Intersection `P(2,3) intersect C = {5}`. Output is 0. Doesn't match intersection.

This doesn't work either.

---

Let's focus on the structure again. Four blocks, B1, B2, B3, B4. One output O.
Maybe the output is a pixel-wise operation on the blocks?
O[r,c] = op(B1[r,c], B2[r,c], B3[r,c], B4[r,c])

Operations: Max, Min (already tried). Majority color? Average color (doesn't make sense)?

Let's try majority color.
T1, P(0,0) = {0, 5, 9, 4}. No majority. Output 9.
T1, P(0,1) = {0, 0, 0, 0}. Majority 0. Output 0. Works.
T1, P(1,2) = {8, 0, 0, 4}. No majority. Output 4.
T1, P(3,1) = {8, 0, 0, 4}. No majority. Output 4.
T1, P(3,2) = {0, 0, 0, 4}. Majority 0. Output 4. Fails.

---

What if the green columns are not just delimiters but carry information?
They are always solid green `3`. This seems structural, not data-carrying.

Is there any interaction *between* the blocks?
Maybe B1 modifies B2 somehow? No indication of this.

Could the transformation be simpler? Find the green columns. Extract the four 4x4 blocks.
Identify the dominant non-background color Ck in each block Bk. (C1=8, C2=5, C3=9, C4=4).
Construct the 4x4 output grid.

Maybe the rule is: `Output[r, c]` is the characteristic color `Ck` of the block `Bk` that satisfies some condition at `(r, c)`?

Condition: `Bk[r, c]` is non-zero?
T1, Output[0,0]=9. Pixels {0, 5, 9, 4}. Non-zero in B2, B3, B4. Char colors {5, 9, 4}. Output 9. Max char color?
T1, Output[1,2]=4. Pixels {8, 0, 0, 4}. Non-zero in B1, B4. Char colors {8, 4}. Output 4. Min char color?

This leads back to inconsistent tie-breakers.

What if the condition is `Bk[r, c] == some_target_color`?
Or `Bk[r, c]` is the max/min pixel at that location?

Let's try selecting based on max pixel value at (r,c).
Rule: Find `k` such that `Bk[r, c]` is maximal among `B1[r, c], B2[r, c], B3[r, c], B4[r, c]` (breaking ties?). Then `Output[r, c] = Ck`.

T1, P(0,0) = {0, 5, 9, 4}. Max is 9 (B3). Output = C3 = 9. Works.
T1, P(0,1) = {0, 0, 0, 0}. Max is 0 (all). Tie. Output 0. Maybe if max is 0, output 0?
T1, P(0,2) = {8, 0, 0, 0}. Max is 8 (B1). Output = C1 = 8. Works.
T1, P(0,3) = {8, 5, 9, 4}. Max is 9 (B3). Output = C3 = 9. Works.
T1, P(1,0) = {0, 5, 9, 0}. Max is 9 (B3). Output = C3 = 9. Works.
T1, P(1,1) = {8, 5, 9, 0}. Max is 9 (B3). Output = C3 = 9. Works.
T1, P(1,2) = {8, 0, 0, 4}. Max is 8 (B1). Output = C1 = 8. Actual output is 4. Fails.

---

Let's try selecting based on min *non-zero* pixel value at (r,c).
Rule: Find `k` such that `Bk[r, c]` is minimal non-zero among `B1[r, c], ...`. Then `Output[r, c] = Ck`. If all are zero, output 0.

T1, P(0,0) = {0, 5, 9, 4}. Non-zero {5, 9, 4}. Min is 4 (B4). Output = C4 = 4. Actual output 9. Fails.

---

Could the rule involve the *position* (r, c) explicitly?
Maybe `Output[r, c] = Ck` where `k = (r + c) % 4`?
T1, O[0,0]: k=0. Output C1=8. Actual 9. Fails.
Maybe `k = r % 4`?
T1, O[0,0]: k=0. Output C1=8. Actual 9. Fails.
Maybe `k = c % 4`?
T1, O[0,0]: k=0. Output C1=8. Actual 9. Fails.

---

Let's revisit the idea: `Output[r, c] = Bk[r, c]` for some `k`.
How is `k` chosen for `(r, c)`?

Look at the values {C1, C2, C3, C4} = {8, 5, 9, 4}.
Maybe `k` is chosen based on which `Ci` is present at `(r, c)`?

Hypothesis: For a given `(r, c)`, scan `k` from 1 to 4. Find the first `k` such that `Bk[r, c]` is equal to *any* characteristic color `Cj`. If found, `Output[r, c] = Bk[r, c]`. If no such `k` is found after checking all 4 blocks, `Output[r, c] = 0`.

Let C = {8, 5, 9, 4}.
T1, (0,0): Pixels (0, 5, 9, 4).
k=1: B1[0,0]=0. 0 not in C.
k=2: B2[0,0]=5. 5 in C. Found. Output = B2[0,0] = 5. Actual output 9. Fails.

Hypothesis: For a given `(r, c)`, scan `k` from 4 down to 1. Find the first `k` such that `Bk[r, c]` is equal to *any* characteristic color `Cj`. If found, `Output[r, c] = Bk[r, c]`. If no such `k` is found, `Output[r, c] = 0`.

T1, (0,0): Pixels (0, 5, 9, 4). C = {8, 5, 9, 4}.
k=4: B4[0,0]=4. 4 in C. Found. Output = B4[0,0] = 4. Actual output 9. Fails.

Hypothesis: For a given `(r, c)`, find the set `S = {k | Bk[r, c] in C}`. If `S` is empty, `Output[r, c] = 0`. If `S` is not empty, choose `k* = max(S)`. `Output[r, c] = Bk*[r, c]`.

T1, (0,0): Pixels (0, 5, 9, 4). C = {8, 5, 9, 4}.
B1[0,0]=0 (not in C)
B2[0,0]=5 (in C). k=1.
B3[0,0]=9 (in C). k=2.
B4[0,0]=4 (in C). k=3.
S = {1, 2, 3}. k* = max(S) = 3. Output = B4[0,0] = 4. Actual output 9. Fails.

Hypothesis: For a given `(r, c)`, find the set `S = {k | Bk[r, c] in C}`. If `S` is empty, `Output[r, c] = 0`. If `S` is not empty, choose `k* = min(S)`. `Output[r, c] = Bk*[r, c]`.

T1, (0,0): Pixels (0, 5, 9, 4). C = {8, 5, 9, 4}.
S = {1, 2, 3}. k* = min(S) = 1. Output = B2[0,0] = 5. Actual output 9. Fails.

---

Let's reconsider the core elements. Four blocks, B1..B4. Four characteristic colors, C1..C4. Output grid O.

Maybe the characteristic colors define a *mapping*?
C1=8, C2=5, C3=9, C4=4.
Could it be that if a pixel `Bk[r, c]` has value `x`, the output is determined by which Cj equals x?

Hypothesis: For each `(r, c)`, find the *highest index* `k` such that `Bk[r, c]` is non-zero. Let this index be `k_max`. The output is `Output[r, c] = C(k_max + 1)`. If all pixels are zero, output 0. (Using 1-based indexing for C).

T1, (0,0): Pixels (0, 5, 9, 4). Non-zero in B2, B3, B4 (indices 1, 2, 3). k_max = 3. Output = C4 = 4. Actual 9. Fails.

Hypothesis: For each `(r, c)`, find the *lowest index* `k` such that `Bk[r, c]` is non-zero. Let this index be `k_min`. The output is `Output[r, c] = C(k_min + 1)`. If all pixels are zero, output 0.

T1, (0,0): Pixels (0, 5, 9, 4). Non-zero in B2, B3, B4 (indices 1, 2, 3). k_min = 1. Output = C2 = 5. Actual 9. Fails.

---

Let's try the "Rule attempt 2" again, but check the calculation for T1, (2,3).
Rule:
1. Blocks B1..B4. Chars C1..C4 = (8, 5, 9, 4).
2. For (r, c):
   a. `S = {k | Bk[r, c] == C(k+1)}` (using 0-based index k)
   b. If `S` empty, Output = 0.
   c. If `|S| = 1`, say `S={k}`, Output = Bk[r, c].
   d. If `|S| > 1`, TBD tie-breaker.

T1, (2,3): Output = 0. Pixels (B1..B4) = (0, 5, 0, 0). Chars (8, 5, 9, 4).
Check matches:
k=0: B1[2,3]=0. C1=8. 0 != 8. No match.
k=1: B2[2,3]=5. C2=5. 5 == 5. Match! S = {1}.
k=2: B3[2,3]=0. C3=9. 0 != 9. No match.
k=3: B4[2,3]=0. C4=4. 0 != 4. No match.
Set S = {1}. It has size 1. Rule says Output = B1[2,3] = 5.
Actual output is 0.

My analysis of the rule application seems correct, but it contradicts the example. The rule must be wrong.

What if the characteristic color isn't the most frequent *non-zero*, but the most frequent overall?
T1 B1: 8(9), 0(7) -> C1=8
T1 B2: 0(9), 5(7) -> C2=0
T1 B3: 0(9), 9(7) -> C3=0
T1 B4: 4(8), 0(8) -> C4=4 (tie-break, maybe?)
Chars = (8, 0, 0, 4).

Let's re-test the rule: `S = {k | Bk[r, c] == C(k+1)}`. If `S` empty, Output=0. If `|S|=1`, Output=Bk[r,c]. If `|S|>1`, ...

T1, (2,3): Output = 0. Pixels (0, 5, 0, 0). Chars (8, 0, 0, 4).
k=0: B1[2,3]=0. C1=8. 0 != 8. No match.
k=1: B2[2,3]=5. C2=0. 5 != 0. No match.
k=2: B3[2,3]=0. C3=0. 0 == 0. Match! S = {2}.
k=3: B4[2,3]=0. C4=4. 0 != 4. No match.
Set S = {2}. Size is 1. Rule says Output = B2[2,3] = 0. Actual output is 0. This works for (2,3)!

Let's re-test T1, (0,0): Output = 9. Pixels (0, 5, 9, 4). Chars (8, 0, 0, 4).
k=0: B1[0,0]=0. C1=8. 0 != 8.
k=1: B2[0,0]=5. C2=0. 5 != 0.
k=2: B3[0,0]=9. C3=0. 9 != 0.
k=3: B4[0,0]=4. C4=4. 4 == 4. Match! S = {3}.
Set S = {3}. Size is 1. Rule says Output = B3[0,0] = 4. Actual output is 9. Fails.

---

Maybe the transformation selects a block `k` based on some global property, and the output is just `Bk`? No, the output is clearly a composite.

Is it possible the green columns *aren't* the delimiters? But they are the only consistent vertical structure across all examples. 4x19 -> 4x4 strongly suggests block extraction.

Could the characteristic color Ck apply to the *whole* output grid somehow?

Let's look at the output grids. Do they have a single most frequent non-zero color?
T1 Output: 9(7), 4(4), 8(2), 0(3). Most freq non-zero is 9 (C3).
T2 Output: 9(7), 4(4), 8(3), 5(1). Most freq non-zero is 9 (C3).
T3 Output: 9(5), 4(4), 8(3), 0(2), 5(1). Most freq non-zero is 9 (C3).
T4 Output: 9(6), 4(4), 5(3), 8(1). Most freq non-zero is 9 (C3).
T5 Output: 9(6), 4(6), 8(2), 5(1). Tie between 9(C3) and 4(C4).
T6 Output: 9(9), 8(2), 4(2), 0(2), 5(1). Most freq non-zero is 9 (C3).

The most frequent non-zero color in the *output* is almost always 9 (Maroon), which is C3.

What is special about B3 / C3?

Let's retry the hypothesis: `Output[r, c]` is the pixel `Bk[r, c]` from the block `k` which has the highest index `k` such that `Bk[r, c]` is non-zero. If all are zero, output is zero.

Let's test this on T1:
Output:

```
9 0 8 9
9 9 4 9
9 9 8 0
4 4 4 0
```

Pixels: B1, B2, B3, B4

(0,0): (0, 5, 9, 4). Non-zero k = {1, 2, 3}. Max k = 3. Output = B4[0,0] = 4. Actual 9. Fails.

Let's try the *lowest* index `k` such that `Bk[r, c]` is non-zero.
(0,0): (0, 5, 9, 4). Non-zero k = {1, 2, 3}. Min k = 1. Output = B2[0,0] = 5. Actual 9. Fails.

---

Final attempt: Maybe the characteristic colors {8, 5, 9, 4} define an order of precedence?
Order: 9 > 8 > 5 > 4 (value) corresponds to C3 > C1 > C2 > C4.
Order: 3 > 0 > 1 > 2 (block index of char color) - doesn't make sense.

Hypothesis: For each position (r, c), look at the pixels (p1, p2, p3, p4) = (B1[r,c], ..., B4[r,c]). Find the set of pixels that are also characteristic colors: `P_char = {pi | pi in {8, 5, 9, 4}}`.
If `P_char` is empty, Output[r, c] = 0.
If `P_char` is not empty, Output[r, c] = max(P_char).

Let C = {8, 5, 9, 4}.
T1, (0,0): Pixels (0, 5, 9, 4). P_char = {5, 9, 4}. Max = 9. Output = 9. Works.
T1, (0,1): Pixels (0, 0, 0, 0). P_char = {}. Output = 0. Works.
T1, (0,2): Pixels (8, 0, 0, 0). P_char = {8}. Max = 8. Output = 8. Works.
T1, (0,3): Pixels (8, 5, 9, 4). P_char = {8, 5, 9, 4}. Max = 9. Output = 9. Works.
T1, (1,0): Pixels (0, 5, 9, 0). P_char = {5, 9}. Max = 9. Output = 9. Works.
T1, (1,1): Pixels (8, 5, 9, 0). P_char = {8, 5, 9}. Max = 9. Output = 9. Works.
T1, (1,2): Pixels (8, 0, 0, 4). P_char = {8, 4}. Max = 8. Output = 8. Actual output is 4. Fails.

Hypothesis: If `P_char` is not empty, Output[r, c] = min(P_char).
T1, (0,0): Pixels (0, 5, 9, 4). P_char = {5, 9, 4}. Min = 4. Output = 4. Actual output is 9. Fails.

What if the rule involves the block index?
For position (r,c), consider pairs `(k, Bk[r,c])`.
Select the pair where `Bk[r,c]` is non-zero, and `k` is maximized? Output the `Bk[r,c]` value? (Tried this, failed).
Select the pair where `Bk[r,c]` is non-zero, and `k` is minimized? Output the `Bk[r,c]` value? (Tried this, failed).

Select the pair where `Bk[r,c]` is non-zero, and `Bk[r,c]` is maximized? Output the `Bk[r,c]` value? (Tried this, failed).
Select the pair where `Bk[r,c]` is non-zero, and `Bk[r,c]` is minimized? Output the `Bk[r,c]` value? (Tried this, failed).

Let's revisit T1, (1,2). Output is 4. Pixels are (8, 0, 0, 4).
Let's revisit T1, (2,3). Output is 0. Pixels are (0, 5, 0, 0).

Maybe the operation depends on the characteristic color of the *output* pixel?

Let's assume the final hypothesis is correct but my check failed.
Hypothesis: For each position (r, c), look at the pixels (p1, p2, p3, p4) = (B1[r,c], ..., B4[r,c]). Find the set of pixels that are also characteristic colors: `P_char = {pi | pi in C}` where `C = {C1, C2, C3, C4}`.
If `P_char` is empty, Output[r, c] = 0.
If `P_char` is not empty, Output[r, c] = max(P_char).

Let's recheck T1, (1,2): Output should be 4.
Pixels = (8, 0, 0, 4). C = {8, 5, 9, 4}.
P_char = {8, 4}. Max(P_char) = 8.
Predicted output: 8. Actual output: 4. Hypothesis fails.

How about: If `P_char` is not empty, find the pixel `pi` in `P_char` that corresponds to the block `Bk` with the *highest index* `k`. Output that pixel `pi`.
T1, (1,2): Pixels = (8, 0, 0, 4). C = {8, 5, 9, 4}.
P_char comes from B1 (pixel 8, index k=0) and B4 (pixel 4, index k=3).
The pixel corresponding to the highest index k is 4 (from k=3).
Predicted output: 4. Actual output: 4. Works for this case!

Let's test this refined hypothesis:
Rule:
1. Find blocks B1..B4.
2. Find characteristic colors C1..C4 (most freq non-zero in each block). Let C = {C1, C2, C3, C4}.
3. For each (r, c):
   a. Get pixels P = (B1[r,c], ..., B4[r,c]).
   b. Find matching indices `K_match = {k | P[k] in C}`. (k is 0-based index).
   c. If `K_match` is empty, `Output[r, c] = 0`.
   d. If `K_match` is not empty, find `k* = max(K_match)`.
   e. `Output[r, c] = P[k*]` (which is `B(k*+1)[r, c]`).

Test on T1: C = {8, 5, 9, 4}.
- (0,0): P=(0, 5, 9, 4). K_match={1(5 in C), 2(9 in C), 3(4 in C)}. k*=max(1,2,3)=3. Output=P[3]=4. Actual 9. Fails.

---

What if the characteristic colors are determined differently?
Maybe Ck is just the color of the top-left pixel of Bk?
T1: C1=0, C2=5, C3=9, C4=4. C = {0, 5, 9, 4}.
Rule: Find `k* = max({k | P[k] in C})`. Output `P[k*]`. If no match, output 0.

Test on T1: C = {0, 5, 9, 4}.
- (0,0): P=(0, 5, 9, 4). K_match={0(0 in C), 1(5 in C), 2(9 in C), 3(4 in C)}. k*=max(0,1,2,3)=3. Output=P[3]=4. Actual 9. Fails.

Maybe the selection rule is fixed? Output[r,c] = Bk[r,c] where k depends only on r,c?
T1 Map (Inferred which block the output pixel came from):

```
B3  ? B1 B3
B3 B3 B4 B3
B3 B3 B1  ?
B4 B4 B4  ?
```

T2 Map:
Output:

```
4 9 9 9
4 9 4 9
8 4 5 9
9 8 8 9
```

Pixels B1(8), B2(5), B3(9), B4(4):
(0,0): P=(0,5,0,4). Output 4 -> B4
(0,1): P=(0,5,9,0). Output 9 -> B3
(0,2): P=(8,0,9,4). Output 9 -> B3
(0,3): P=(
