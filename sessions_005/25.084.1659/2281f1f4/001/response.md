    Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
    1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2. Identify the horizontal pattern defined by the positions of gray (5) pixels 
       in the first row (row 0) of the input grid, considering only columns from 
       0 up to the second-to-last column (width - 2).
    3. Iterate through each subsequent row 'r' of the input grid (from row 1 to height - 1).
    4. Check if the pixel in the last column (column index = width - 1) of row 'r' is gray (5).
    5. If it is gray (5) (a 'trigger row'), then iterate through the columns 'c' from 0 to width - 2:
       - If the pixel at position (0, 'c') in the input grid is gray (5) (part of the pattern), 
         change the pixel at position ('r', 'c') in the output grid to red (2).
    6. Leave all other pixels in the output grid unchanged.
    7. Return the modified output grid.
