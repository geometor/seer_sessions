For each container, the goal is to find a distinct, non-white, non-gray colored object adjacent to its exterior boundary. If such a unique adjacent object exists, its color is used to fill the interior area enclosed by the gray container. Subsequently, the original adjacent object that provided the fill color is removed (replaced by white (0) pixels). Objects not involved in this container-filler interaction remain unchanged.\n\n**Key elements:**\n\n1.  **Containers:** Closed loops/regions formed by connected gray (5) pixels.\n2.  **Fillers:** Connected objects of a single color (not white or gray) adjacent to the *exterior* of a container.\n3.  **Interior:** The area enclosed by a gray container, initially consisting of non-gray pixels.\n4.  **Interaction:** A container interacts with a filler object if the filler is adjacent to the container's exterior boundary.\n5.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The interior of the container is filled with the color of the adjacent filler object.\n    *   The adjacent filler object is removed (pixels turned white (0)).\n6.  **Condition:** This transformation only occurs if there is *exactly one* unique filler object adjacent to the container's exterior.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
