task_elements:
  - role: container
    color: gray (5)
    property: forms a closed loop enclosing an area
    description: A contiguous region of gray pixels that separates an interior area from the exterior.
  - role: filler_source
    color: any color except white (0) or gray (5)
    property: contiguous region of a single color
    description: An object located outside a container, potentially providing the fill color.
  - role: interior_pixels
    color: initially any color except gray (5)
    property: enclosed by a container
    description: Pixels inside the boundary formed by a gray container.
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    description: The default background color, also used to erase filler sources.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    from: filler_source
    to: container
    detail: The filler_source object must touch (share an edge or corner) the exterior boundary pixels of the container object.
  - type: enclosure
    container: container
    contained: interior_pixels
    detail: The container object topologically separates the interior_pixels from the grid boundaries and other exterior regions.

actions:
  - name: identify_containers
    input: grid
    output: list of gray (5) container objects
  - name: identify_filler_sources
    input: grid
    output: list of non-white, non-gray objects
  - name: determine_interior
    input: container object, grid
    output: set of interior pixel coordinates
  - name: find_adjacent_filler
    input: container object, list of filler_sources, grid
    output: unique adjacent filler_source object (or none)
  - name: fill_interior
    input: interior pixel coordinates, filler color
    target: output grid
    effect: Changes the color of interior pixels to the filler color.
  - name: remove_filler_source
    input: filler_source object coordinates
    target: output grid
    effect: Changes the color of the filler source pixels to white (0).

transformation_conditions:
  - condition: A gray container must exist.
  - condition: The gray container must enclose an interior region.
  - condition: Exactly one filler_source object must be adjacent to the exterior of the container.

output_grid_generation:
  - step: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: Apply fill_interior and remove_filler_source actions for all container-filler pairs meeting the conditions.
  - step: Pixels not part of a modified interior or a removed filler source retain their original color.
