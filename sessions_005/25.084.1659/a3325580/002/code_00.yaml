task_context:
  description: Transforms an input grid containing multiple colored objects into an output grid based on the size and position of the largest objects.
  input_type: 2D grid of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  output_type: 2D grid of integers (0-9) representing colors.

grid_properties:
  background_color: 0 (white)
  max_dimensions: 30x30

object_definition:
  type: Connected component of contiguous pixels (up, down, left, right neighbors) sharing the same non-background color.
  properties:
    - color: The integer value (1-9) of the pixels in the object.
    - size: The number of pixels comprising the object.
    - position: Represented by the set of pixel coordinates (row, col).
    - left_most_col: The minimum column index among all pixels in the object.
    - top_most_row_in_left_col: The minimum row index among pixels located in the 'left_most_col'.

transformation_steps:
  - identify_objects: Scan the input grid to find all distinct objects. For each object, determine its color, size, and pixel coordinates. Also determine the column index of its left-most pixel (`left_most_col`) and the row index of the top-most pixel within that column (`top_most_row_in_left_col`).
  - find_max_size: Calculate the maximum size among all identified objects.
  - filter_max_size_objects: Select only those objects whose size equals the maximum size.
  - sort_objects: Sort the filtered objects based on their spatial position in the input grid. The primary sort key is `left_most_col` (ascending). The secondary sort key is `top_most_row_in_left_col` (ascending). The tertiary sort key is the object's `color` (ascending).
  - extract_colors: Create an ordered list of colors from the sorted objects.
  - construct_output:
      - Determine dimensions: Height is `max_size`, Width is the number of colors in the sorted list.
      - Create an empty grid with these dimensions.
      - Populate the grid: Fill each column entirely with a single color, using the colors from the sorted list in order from left to right.

edge_cases:
  - no_objects: If the input grid contains only the background color or is empty, the output should ideally reflect this, possibly an empty grid or a 1x1 grid of background color. The current code produces an empty array `[[]]`.
  - multiple_objects_same_max_size: Handled by sorting based on position as described above.
  - ties_in_position_sort: Handled by secondary (top row in left col) and tertiary (color value) sort keys.
