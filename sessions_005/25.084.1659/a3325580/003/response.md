Transformation Rule:
1. Scan the input grid to identify all distinct objects (connected components of the same non-background color using 4-way adjacency).
2. For each object found, record its color, its size (number of pixels), the column index of its left-most pixel, and the row index of its top-most pixel within that left-most column.
3. Determine the maximum size (`max_size`) among all identified objects. If no objects exist, return an empty grid.
4. Select all objects whose size is equal to `max_size`.
5. Sort these selected objects based on their position: primarily by their left-most column index (ascending), secondarily by their top-most row index within that column (ascending), and tertiarily by their color value (ascending).
6. Create an ordered list of colors from the sorted objects. Let the number of colors in this list be `num_colors`.
7. Generate the output grid with height equal to `max_size` and width equal to `num_colors`.
8. Fill the output grid column by column: the first column is filled entirely with the first color in the ordered list, the second column with the second color, and so on.
