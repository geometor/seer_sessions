The outputs are smaller rectangular grids, often taller than they are wide.\n2.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels in the input form distinct contiguous objects. An object is defined as a group of connected pixels of the same color (sharing sides, not just corners).\n3.  **Color Relevance:** The colors present in the output grid are always a subset of the non-white colors present in the input grid.\n4.  **Object Size:** The size (number of pixels) of each object appears crucial.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:**\n    *   The process seems to involve identifying all distinct objects in the input grid.\n    *   Calculating the size of each object.\n    *   Finding the maximum size among all identified objects.\n    *   Identifying the colors of all objects that achieve this maximum size.\n    *   The output grid's dimensions are determined by this analysis: the height equals the maximum object size, and the width equals the number of distinct colors that have objects of the maximum size.\n    *   The colors identified are sorted numerically (by their integer value, ascending).\n    *   The output grid is constructed column by column, with each column filled entirely by one of the sorted colors.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
