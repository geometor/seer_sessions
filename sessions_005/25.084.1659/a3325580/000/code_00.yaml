task_elements:
  - type: grid
    role: input
    description: A 2D grid of pixels with values 0-9 representing colors. Contains a background (color 0) and multiple distinct objects.
    properties:
      height: 10
      width: 10
  - type: grid
    role: output
    description: A smaller 2D grid of pixels representing a selection and arrangement of colors from the input.
    properties:
      height: Variable, equals the maximum size of the selected objects from the input.
      width: Variable, equals the count of selected colors from the input.
      content: Columns filled with specific colors.

objects:
  - type: connected_component
    source: input
    definition: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-zero color. Connectivity is defined by adjacent pixels (sharing an edge).
    properties:
      - color: The integer value (1-9) of the pixels in the object.
      - size: The count of pixels belonging to the object.
      - pixels: List of coordinates (row, col) for each pixel in the object.

relationships:
  - type: size_comparison
    description: Objects are compared based on their size (pixel count).
  - type: selection
    criteria: Objects whose size is equal to the maximum size found among all objects in the input grid.
  - type: color_extraction
    source: selected objects
    target: output grid columns
    rule: The colors of the selected objects determine the colors used in the output grid columns.
  - type: sorting
    elements: colors of selected objects
    order: Numerical ascending (based on color index 1-9).
  - type: construction
    target: output grid
    based_on:
      - maximum object size (determines height)
      - count of selected colors (determines width)
      - sorted selected colors (determines column fill colors)

transformation:
  - step: Identify all connected components (objects) of non-zero colors in the input grid.
  - step: Calculate the size (pixel count) for each identified object.
  - step: Determine the maximum size (`max_size`) among all objects.
  - step: Identify all distinct colors (`selected_colors`) corresponding to objects that have a size equal to `max_size`.
  - step: Sort the `selected_colors` numerically in ascending order.
  - step: Determine the output grid dimensions: height = `max_size`, width = number of `selected_colors`.
  - step: Construct the output grid where each column `j` (0-indexed) is filled entirely with the color `selected_colors[j]`.
