```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transforms the input grid based on color swapping rules defined by the top-left 2x2 corner, excluding the corner itself from the transformation.
1. Identify the four colors in the top-left 2x2 corner: C00, C01, C10, C11.
2. Define two swap pairs: (C00, C01) and (C10, C11).
3. Create a copy of the input grid.
4. Iterate through the input grid, *excluding* the pixels at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1).
5. For each pixel outside the corner:
    a. If its color is C00, change the corresponding pixel in the copy to C01.
    b. If its color is C01, change the corresponding pixel in the copy to C00.
    c. If its color is C10, change the corresponding pixel in the copy to C11.
    d. If its color is C11, change the corresponding pixel in the copy to C10.
    e. Keep all other colors unchanged (already handled by copying).
6. Return the modified grid copy.
