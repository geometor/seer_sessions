White (0) acts as the background.\n    *   The core transformation involves changing the colors of certain pixels.\n    *   Comparing input and output grids reveals that specific pairs of colors seem to be swapped throughout the grid.\n    *   The specific pairs of colors being swapped differ between the training examples.\n    *   Observing the top-left 2x2 corner of the input grid in each example reveals the colors involved in the swaps for that specific example.\n        *   Example 1: Top-left is `[[1, 3], [2, 8]]`. Swaps observed: Blue (1) <=> Green (3) and Red (2) <=> Azure (8).\n        *   Example 2: Top-left is `[[4, 2], [3, 7]]`. Swaps observed: Yellow (4) <=> Red (2) and Green (3) <=> Orange (7).\n        *   Example 3: Top-left is `[[9, 4], [7, 6]]`. Swaps observed: Maroon (9) <=> Yellow (4) and Orange (7) <=> Magenta (6).\n    *   This suggests the top-left 2x2 area acts as a key or legend defining the color swaps for the rest of the grid.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Let the color at `(0,0)` be `ColorA`, the color at `(0,1)` be `ColorB`, the color at `(1,0)` be `ColorC`, and the color at `(1,1)` be `ColorD`.\n    2.  Define two color swap rules based on these identified colors:\n        *   Rule 1: `ColorA` swaps with `ColorB`.\n        *   Rule 2: `ColorC` swaps with `ColorD`.\n    3.  Create the output grid by iterating through each pixel of the input grid.\n    4.  For each pixel in the input grid:\n        *   If the pixel's color is `ColorA`, change its color to `ColorB` in the output grid.\n        *   If the pixel's color is `ColorB`, change its color to `ColorA` in the output grid.\n        *   If the pixel's color is `ColorC`, change its color to `ColorD` in the output grid.\n        *   If the pixel's color is `ColorD`, change its color to `ColorC` in the output grid.\n        *   If the pixel's color is none of the above (`ColorA`, `ColorB`, `ColorC`, `ColorD`), keep its color the same in the output grid.\n    5.
