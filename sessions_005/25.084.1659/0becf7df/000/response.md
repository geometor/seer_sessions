*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   Each task instance consists of an input grid and an output grid.
    *   The grids contain pixels of various colors (represented by integers 0-9). White (0) acts as the background.
    *   The core transformation involves changing the colors of certain pixels.
    *   Comparing input and output grids reveals that specific pairs of colors seem to be swapped throughout the grid.
    *   The specific pairs of colors being swapped differ between the training examples.
    *   Observing the top-left 2x2 corner of the input grid in each example reveals the colors involved in the swaps for that specific example.
        *   Example 1: Top-left is `[[1, 3], [2, 8]]`. Swaps observed: Blue (1) <=> Green (3) and Red (2) <=> Azure (8).
        *   Example 2: Top-left is `[[4, 2], [3, 7]]`. Swaps observed: Yellow (4) <=> Red (2) and Green (3) <=> Orange (7).
        *   Example 3: Top-left is `[[9, 4], [7, 6]]`. Swaps observed: Maroon (9) <=> Yellow (4) and Orange (7) <=> Magenta (6).
    *   This suggests the top-left 2x2 area acts as a key or legend defining the color swaps for the rest of the grid.

        properties:
          location: Rows 0-1, Columns 0-1.
          role: Defines the color transformation rules.
          content: Four pixels representing four colors (C00, C01, C10, C11).
      - description: Non-white pixels in the grid.
        properties:
          role: Subject to color transformation based on the 2x2 key.
    transformation:
      action: Color swapping.
      rules:
        - rule_pair_1: Swap color C00 with color C01.
        - rule_pair_2: Swap color C10 with color C11.
      scope: Applied to all pixels in the input grid.
      unaffected_colors: Any color not present in the top-left 2x2 key remains unchanged.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the four colors located in the top-left 2x2 corner of the input grid. Let the color at `(0,0)` be `ColorA`, the color at `(0,1)` be `ColorB`, the color at `(1,0)` be `ColorC`, and the color at `(1,1)` be `ColorD`.
    2.  Define two color swap rules based on these identified colors:
        *   Rule 1: `ColorA` swaps with `ColorB`.
        *   Rule 2: `ColorC` swaps with `ColorD`.
    3.  Create the output grid by iterating through each pixel of the input grid.
    4.  For each pixel in the input grid:
        *   If the pixel's color is `ColorA`, change its color to `ColorB` in the output grid.
        *   If the pixel's color is `ColorB`, change its color to `ColorA` in the output grid.
        *   If the pixel's color is `ColorC`, change its color to `ColorD` in the output grid.
        *   If the pixel's color is `ColorD`, change its color to `ColorC` in the output grid.
        *   If the pixel's color is none of the above (`ColorA`, `ColorB`, `ColorC`, `ColorD`), keep its color the same in the output grid.
    5.  The resulting grid is the final output.
