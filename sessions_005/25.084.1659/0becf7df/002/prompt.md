Previous Code:
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transforms the input grid based on color swapping rules defined by the top-left 2x2 corner.
1. Identify the four colors in the top-left 2x2 corner: C00, C01, C10, C11.
2. Define two swap pairs: (C00, C01) and (C10, C11).
3. Iterate through the input grid.
4. For each pixel, if its color is C00, change it to C01. If C01, change to C00.
5. If its color is C10, change it to C11. If C11, change to C10.
6. Keep all other colors unchanged.
7. Return the modified grid.
