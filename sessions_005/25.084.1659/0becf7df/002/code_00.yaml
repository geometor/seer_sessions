Input Grid:
  - A 2D grid of pixels with integer values representing colors.
  - Contains a special region: the top-left 2x2 corner.

Top-Left 2x2 Corner (Key):
  - Location: Pixels at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).
  - Let the colors be C00, C01, C10, C11 respectively.
  - Purpose: Defines two color swapping rules for the rest of the grid.
  - Rule 1: Swap color C00 with color C01.
  - Rule 2: Swap color C10 with color C11.
  - This 2x2 region itself is *not* modified in the output grid.

Transformation Area:
  - All pixels in the input grid *except* for the top-left 2x2 corner.

Action:
  - For each pixel in the Transformation Area:
    - If the pixel color is C00, change it to C01.
    - If the pixel color is C01, change it to C00.
    - If the pixel color is C10, change it to C11.
    - If the pixel color is C11, change it to C10.
    - If the pixel color matches none of these four key colors, leave it unchanged.

Output Grid:
  - Same dimensions as the input grid.
  - The top-left 2x2 corner is identical to the input grid's top-left 2x2 corner.
  - All other pixels are the result of applying the swapping rules defined by the input's top-left 2x2 corner.
