White is the background color. Azure forms distinct shapes. Red appears only in the output grid.\n3.  **Objects:** The main object in each input grid is a contiguous shape made of azure pixels. This shape often contains \"holes\" or internal areas filled with white pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of *some* white pixels to red. The azure pixels remain unchanged.\n5.  **Pattern:** The white pixels that change to red appear to be those located *inside* the azure shape. \"Inside\" seems to mean areas of white pixels that are completely surrounded by azure pixels, such that they cannot reach the outer boundary of the grid without crossing an azure pixel.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
