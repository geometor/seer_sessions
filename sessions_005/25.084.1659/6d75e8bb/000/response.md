Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), azure (8), and red (2). White is the background color. Azure forms distinct shapes. Red appears only in the output grid.
3.  **Objects:** The main object in each input grid is a contiguous shape made of azure pixels. This shape often contains "holes" or internal areas filled with white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of *some* white pixels to red. The azure pixels remain unchanged.
5.  **Pattern:** The white pixels that change to red appear to be those located *inside* the azure shape. "Inside" seems to mean areas of white pixels that are completely surrounded by azure pixels, such that they cannot reach the outer boundary of the grid without crossing an azure pixel.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - Input and Output are 2D arrays of integers (pixels).
      - Dimensions vary but are within 30x30.
      - Pixels represent colors (0: white, 8: azure, 2: red).
  - type: Objects
    properties:
      - The input contains a primary object composed of contiguous azure (8) pixels.
      - The background is composed of white (0) pixels.
      - The azure object may contain internal regions (holes) of white pixels.
  - type: Transformation
    properties:
      - Changes color of specific white (0) pixels to red (2).
      - Does not change the color or position of azure (8) pixels.
      - Does not change the color of white (0) pixels that are not enclosed.
  - type: Relationship
    properties:
      - The white pixels that change color are those enclosed within the azure object.
      - Enclosed means a region of white pixels from which the grid boundary cannot be reached by moving only through other white pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all contiguous regions of white (0) pixels in the input grid.
3.  For each distinct region of white pixels:
    a.  Check if any pixel in this white region touches the boundary (top, bottom, left, or right edge) of the grid.
    b.  If the white region *does not* touch the boundary, then it is considered "enclosed".
    c.  If the white region is "enclosed", change the color of *all* pixels belonging to this region in the output grid to red (2).
4.  Return the modified output grid.
