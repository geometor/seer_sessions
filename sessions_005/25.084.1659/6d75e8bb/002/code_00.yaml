task_description: Fill enclosed areas defined by a specific color border.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Vary between examples (e.g., 7x8, 14x10, 9x8).
  - background_color: white (0) seems to be the primary background or canvas color.
objects:
  - object: border
    color: azure (8)
    description: Forms closed or partially closed shapes within the grid. Acts as a barrier.
  - object: fill_target
    color: white (0)
    description: Pixels located inside the area enclosed by the azure border.
  - object: fill_color
    color: red (2)
    description: The color used to replace the enclosed white pixels.
  - object: external_area
    color: white (0)
    description: White pixels that are connected to the grid boundary without crossing an azure border. These remain unchanged.
actions:
  - action: identify_enclosed_regions
    input: input grid
    output: set of coordinates for white pixels considered "enclosed"
    criteria: A white pixel is enclosed if it cannot reach any boundary pixel of the grid via a path (4-connectivity: up, down, left, right) consisting only of non-azure pixels.
  - action: color_fill
    target: enclosed white pixels identified in the previous step
    color: change from white (0) to red (2)
    output: transformed grid
constraints:
  - Only white pixels can be changed to red.
  - Azure pixels remain unchanged.
  - White pixels not enclosed by azure pixels remain unchanged.
  - Connectivity is defined by adjacent (non-diagonal) pixels.
