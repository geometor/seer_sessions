objects:
  - name: vertical_group
    description: A contiguous set of pixels of the same non-white color, aligned vertically.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the group.
      - positions: A list of (row, column) coordinates for each pixel in the group.

  - name: horizontal_group
    description: A contiguous set of pixels of the same non-white color, aligned horizontally.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the group.
      - positions: A list of (row, column) coordinates for each pixel in the group.

  - name: red_pixel
    description: a pixel with color value 2
    properties:
      - row: int
      - col: int

  - name: grey_pixel
    description: a pixel with color value 5
    properties:
      - row: int
      - col: int

actions:
  - name: vertical_propagation
    description: >
      When a red pixel is vertically below a grey pixel within a vertical group,
      and the grey pixel is, itself, vertically below another non-white, non-red,
      non-grey pixel, the red pixel changes to the color of that trigger
      pixel, the trigger pixel and any grey pixels above the red pixel are
      cleared (turned white).
  - name: horizontal_replacement
    description: >
      Remaining red pixels (after vertical propagation) are replaced by the color of
      the first adjacent (horizontally or vertically) non-white, non-red, non-grey pixel.
      If no such neighbor exists, the red pixel remains unchanged.
  - name: shrink_grid
    description: The grid shrinks to the smallest rectangle bounding box containing all non-white pixels.
