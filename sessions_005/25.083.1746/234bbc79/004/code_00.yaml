objects:
  - type: vertical_group
    description: Vertically adjacent pixels of the same non-white color.
    properties:
      color: The color of the pixels in the group.
      positions: A list of (row, column) tuples representing the positions of the pixels.

  - type: horizontal_group
    description: Horizontally adjacent pixels of the same non-white color.
    properties:
      color: The color of the pixels in the group.
      positions: A list of (row, column) tuples representing the positions of the pixels.

actions:
  - name: vertical_propagation
    trigger:  A red pixel within a vertical group, with a grey pixel somewhere above it, and a non-grey, non-red, and non-white pixel above the grey
    behavior: |
        1. the color of the triggering (topmost, non red/grey/white) pixel replaces the color of the red pixel.
        2. The triggering pixel becomes white (0).
        3. All grey pixels directly above the red pixel within the group become white

  - name: horizontal_propagation_stage_1
    trigger: a horizontal group of grey pixels adjacent to a horizontal group of non-white and non-red colored pixels exists.
    behavior: The colored pixels are not modified.

  - name: horizontal_propagation_stage_2
    trigger: a horizontal group of grey pixels adjacent to a horizontal group of non-white and non-red colored pixels. AND remaining red pixels.
    behavior: Replace any remaining Red pixels with the color from the colored group.
