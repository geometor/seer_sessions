The output grid appears to be a scaled-up version of the input grid, with each pixel in the input replicated multiple times to form a larger square in the output. The scaling factor seems consistent across both examples, and the relative positions of the colors are maintained. The background color (0, white) also gets expanded.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

That is, if the input pixel is at row `r`, column `c`, the top-left corner of the 3x3 block will be at row `3r`, column `3c` in the output grid.\n6.  **Complete Output:**  The output is built up block by block.\n"
