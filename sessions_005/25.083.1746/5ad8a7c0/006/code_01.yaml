objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - cells: contain values 0-9 representing colors
      - red_pixels: cells with value 2
  - type: connected_component
    properties:
      - shape: can be Horizontal, Vertical, Other (L, T, +, single pixel, or others)
      - length: number of pixels in the component
      - contiguous: whether the components connect
      - isolated: Whether red pixels are isolated segments

actions:
  - name: expand
    target: connected_component
    condition:
      - shape: Horizontal or Vertical
      - length: greater than 1
      - isolated: true  # Only expand isolated lines
    transformation: >
      - If Horizontal, set all cells in the same row as the component to red (2).
      - If Vertical, set all cells in the same column as the component to red (2).
  - name: identify
    target: grid
    transformation: Find all connected components of red pixels.
  - name: classify
    target: connected_component
    transformation: Determine the shape and properties of each component.
