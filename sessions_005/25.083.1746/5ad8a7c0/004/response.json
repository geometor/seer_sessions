            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program was too restrictive. It only expanded red lines if there was *exactly one* in the entire grid. The examples show a more complex rule is at play. It seems that the expansion of red lines happens selectively even when multiple lines are present, especially when lines intersect. It looks for *connected* red lines forming simple shapes.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Intersections:** The core issue seems to be how the program handles multiple red lines, particularly where they might intersect. We need to check for connected components more intelligently, distinguishing between separate lines and those forming \"T\" or \"+\" shapes.\n2.  **Refine Line Detection:** Instead of simply counting lines, we need to detect connected components of red pixels. A connected component can be a single horizontal or vertical line, but also a combination of those (like a 'T' or '+').\n3.  **Conditional Expansion:** Based on the *shape* of the connected component, decide whether to extend. Simple horizontal or vertical lines are candidates for extension, L shapes, T and + shapes shouldn't be extended.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution to confirm assumptions):**\n\n"
