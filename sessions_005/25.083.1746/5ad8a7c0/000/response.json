            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 2D grids of varying sizes, populated primarily with '0' (white) and '2' (red) pixels.  The core operation seems to involve identifying and potentially modifying connected regions of '2' (red) pixels. The transformation isn't a simple global change (like color inversion) but is sensitive to the spatial arrangement of the '2's. Some examples show the input being unchanged (train\\_2, train\\_4) and others have transformation (train\\_1, train\\_3, train\\_5). It appears that the critical factor is the connectivity and shape of the red regions. Specifically, isolated '2' pixels, or small, disconnected groups, are not changed. Connected red \"lines\" are sometimes extended, but not in all cases.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
