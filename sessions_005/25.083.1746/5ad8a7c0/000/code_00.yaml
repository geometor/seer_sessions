objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - width: variable (6 in most examples)
      - height: variable (4 in most examples)
      - cells: integers (0-9, primarily 0 and 2)

  - name: red_region
    type: connected_component
    properties:
      - color: 2 (red)
      - shape: variable (single pixels, lines, etc.)
      - connectivity:  (isolated, horizontal line, vertical line, L-shape, etc)
      - change_state: variable (same, expand)

actions:
  - name: extend_red_region
    preconditions:
      - red_region.connectivity:  must include at least one horizontal or vertical line of at least two adjacent pixels in the same line or column
    postconditions:
      - red_region.shape:  line is filled in the output
    constraints:
        - the region must be a horizontal or vertical and all pixels are connected.

  - name: no_change
    preconditions:
        - red_region.shape is a collection of points or red_region are arranged in the same dimensions in rows and columns
    postconditions:
      - red_region: remains unchanged

relationships:
  - adjacency:  determines connectivity of red_region
  - containment:  grid contains red_regions
