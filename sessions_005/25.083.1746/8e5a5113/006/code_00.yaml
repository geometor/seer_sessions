facts:
  - observation: "All examples have a contiguous vertical block of white (0) pixels in the center."
    example_indices: [0, 1, 2]
  - observation: "The columns to the left of the white block in the input are replaced by the colors from the rightmost column."
    example_indices: [0, 1, 2]
    details: "The rightmost columns values in the input appear to fill all the columns to the left of the white space in the transformed output."
  - observation: "The columns to the right of the white block in the output are a mirror image of the columns left of the center in the input."
    example_indices: [0, 1, 2]
  - observation: "The output maintains the same dimensions as the input."
    example_indices: [0, 1, 2]
  - observation: "The transformed output includes all colors from the input with the exception of 'white' (color code '0') to the left and right of the central 'white' columns."
