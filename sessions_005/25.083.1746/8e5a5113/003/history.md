Here's an analysis of the results and a plan to refine the natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of mirroring around a central "white" column and transferring the leftmost/rightmost columns was partially correct but fundamentally flawed. The code misinterprets the mirroring process and incorrectly handles the transfer of colors. The consistent failure across all examples, with many pixels off and incorrect color palettes, indicates a significant misunderstanding of the core transformation. The central column of zeros is an important anchor, but the mirroring and transferring is incorrectly performed. The primary issue lies in assuming a simple reflection and incorrect color transferring.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine the Mirroring:** The current mirroring logic is incorrect. Instead of a direct reflection across the central white column, the transformation appears to involve taking the _colors_ from the left side of the white column and using them in a _mirrored order_ *but* assigning those colors in the correct mirrored locations on the right side.

2.  **Re-evaluate Color Transfer:** The current logic overwrites parts of the grid intended for mirroring. We must modify the function to consider color transfers *before* the main reflection.

3.  **Object Identification:** Focus on identifying "objects" not just as contiguous blocks of the same color but as distinct color *patterns* on either side of the central white column. The transformation replicates these patterns in a specific way.

**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection, not code execution for this specific response, because image visualization is not available, and I am working from the provided text outputs):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input has a central white column at index 4, 5, and 6.
    *   Left side pattern: `6 3 3 5`, `6 3 3 5`, `6 3 2 5`
    *   Right side pattern (expected): Mirrored colors but not a simple reflection of locations `6 6 6 5` and `2 3 6`, `3 3 3 5` and `3 3 6`, `3 3 3 5` and `3 3 6`
    *   The right side appears to copy the values from left side into the positions mirrored on the right side across the axis on the left side of the central zeros.
    *	The leftmost column is copied to the column to the right of the central zeros.
    *	The rightmost column is copied to the leftmost column.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input has a central white column at index 4, 5, and 6.
    *   Left side pattern: `1 1 2 5`, `4 1 1 5`, `4 4 1 5`
    *   Right side pattern (expected): Similar mirroring logic as Example 1.
    *	The leftmost column is copied to the column to the right of the central zeros.
    *	The rightmost column is copied to the leftmost column.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input has a central white column at index 4, 5, and 6.
    *   Left side pattern: `2 7 8 5`, `7 7 8 5`, `8 8 8 5`
    *   Right side pattern (expected): Similar mirroring logic as Example 1.
    *	The leftmost column is copied to the column to the right of the central zeros.
    *	The rightmost column is copied to the leftmost column.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Central White Columns:** Find the starting and ending indices of the contiguous vertical columns of `0`s (white) that divide the input grid.

2.  **Mirror Colors:**
    *   Starting at the left edge of the central white column (index `central_white_column_start`), work outwards to the left edge and note the cell colors.
    *   Mirror the color values into their correct mirrored locations.

3. **Transfer Colors:**
    * transfer leftmost colors
        * starting from the central white columns and working left, replace
          values with leftmost column values
    * transfer rightmost colors
        * transfer the values from the rightmost column to the leftmost columns
