All input and output grids have the same dimensions.\n*   **Colors (Values):**  Cells within the grids have integer values representing colors. The prominent colors are black (0) and a variety of others.\n*   **Objects:**  It appears that clusters of non-black pixels form objects.  These objects are not always contiguous. The transformation seems to involve reflecting and maybe duplicating these objects.\n*   **Symmetry/Reflection:** A strong sense of mirroring is present.  It seems that objects might be mirrored or reflected either vertically or horizontally across the center of the grid.\n* **Duplication:** The output has double pixels of some input pixels\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"

Consider them as parts of various objects.\n2.  **Divide the Grid:** Imagine a diagonal dividing line from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid.\n3. **Reflect and duplicate:** For each object in the top-left triangle create a reflection in the bottom right triange by, for each pixel, switching rows with columns. Duplicate each pixel of the reflected object horizontally to the left of the reflected pixel if the column number of original object's pixel is even, vertically down of the reflected pixel if column number of the original object's pixel is odd.\n4. **Reflect and duplicate:** For each object in the bottom-right triangle create a reflection in the top left triange by, for each pixel, switching rows with columns. Duplicate each pixel of the reflected object horizontally to the right of the reflected pixel if the column number of original object's pixel is odd, vertically up of the reflected pixel if column number of the original object's pixel is even.\n\nEssentially the program performs a reflection across the main diagonal, creating the symmetric pattern and a conditional duplication.\n"
