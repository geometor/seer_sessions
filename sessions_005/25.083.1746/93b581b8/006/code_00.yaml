facts:
  - description: "The output grid is the same size as the input grid."
    type: "grid_size"
  - description: "Each pixel in the input grid is reflected across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)."
    type: "reflection"
  - description: "The reflection involves swapping the row and column indices of each pixel."
    type: "index_swap"
  - description: "After reflection, a 2x2 block of the same color is created, with the reflected pixel's location as the top-left corner of the block."
    type: "block_creation"
  - description: "The color of the reflected pixel and thus, the 2x2 block uses the original location of the pixel, effectively a swap"
    type: "color_swap"
  - description: "All pixels in the input have corresponding reflections and 2x2 blocks, including the 0 valued pixels"
    type: "all_pixels"
