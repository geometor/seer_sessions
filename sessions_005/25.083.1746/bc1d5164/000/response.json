Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grids:** Rectangular grids of varying dimensions, containing single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors.\n2.  **Output Grids:** Rectangular grids, seemingly derived from the input grids, also containing single-digit integers (0-9). The output grids are consistently 3x3.\n3.  **Dominant Colors:** In each input, there's a prominent non-zero color along the edges. All outputs contain only 2 colors, 0 (white) and a single other color that appears to be derived from the colors along the border of the input.\n4.  **Spatial Relationship:** The output grid appears to maintain a compressed, or summarized version of the input border colors.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The only exception is the very center, make this the same color as the border.\n4.  **Fill Remaining Cells:** Fill any cells not specified in the last step with 0 (white).\n\nEssentially, the program extracts the non-zero color that borders the input and sets the color of the output grid to that color and maintains the shape of the outer ring.\n"
