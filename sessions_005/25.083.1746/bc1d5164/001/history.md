Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grids:** Rectangular grids of varying dimensions, containing single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors.
2.  **Output Grids:** Rectangular grids, seemingly derived from the input grids, also containing single-digit integers (0-9). The output grids are consistently 3x3.
3.  **Dominant Colors:** In each input, there's a prominent non-zero color along the edges. All outputs contain only 2 colors, 0 (white) and a single other color that appears to be derived from the colors along the border of the input.
4.  **Spatial Relationship:** The output grid appears to maintain a compressed, or summarized version of the input border colors.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids have varying dimensions.
  - observation: Output grids are always 3x3.
  - observation: Input grids have a non-zero color forming a border.
  - observation: Output grids use a single color (besides 0).
  - observation: Output single color is always the same color along the input grid border.
  - observation: All input non-zero color borders are made of only one color.
  - inference: The output grid is a 3x3 representation of the input grid's border color.
  - inference: The transformation compresses, or summarizes, the input border.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Border Color:** Scan the input grid and determine the single non-zero color present along its outer border (top, bottom, left, and right edges).
2.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid.
3. **Fill Border:** Fill in the output grid's corresponding top, bottom, left and right border with the input border color. The only exception is the very center, make this the same color as the border.
4.  **Fill Remaining Cells:** Fill any cells not specified in the last step with 0 (white).

Essentially, the program extracts the non-zero color that borders the input and sets the color of the output grid to that color and maintains the shape of the outer ring.
