facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid is always 3x3.
  - observation: |
      The output grid is constructed based on the border colors of the input grid.
  - observation: |
      In all examples, the border of the input grid contains only one non-zero color.  The output grid contains only that color and 0.
  - observation: |
      Example 1: Border color 4. Output has 5 pixels of color 4 and 4 pixels of color 0.
  - observation: |
      Example 2: Border color 2. Output has 7 pixels of color 2 and 2 pixels of color 0.
  - observation: |
      Example 3: Border color 4. Output has 6 pixels of color 4 and 3 pixels of color 0.
  - observation: |
      Example 4: Border color 3. Output has 4 pixels of color 3 and 5 pixels of color 0.
  - observation: |
      Example 5: Border color 8. Output has 5 pixels of color 8 and 4 pixels of color 0.
  - rule: The non-zero pixels in the output grid correspond to all pixels on the border of input grid with that color
