Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which it handled with partial success. However, it failed to accurately transform the other examples. The primary issue is that the code assumes the output will always be a 3x3 grid filled with the border color and 0, with a cross shape. Instead of a cross, we need to recreate just the corners. Additionally, the previous solution did not set all the expected output pixels to the correct color. A good strategy will be to:
1. Identify the non-zero border color, as the current code does.
2. Create a 3x3 output grid.
3. Only fill the corner pixels of that 3x3 grid with the identified color.
4. Fill all the non corner pixels with 0.

**Gather Metrics and Evidence:**

Let's analyze some additional metrics using a combination of observation and the pixel mismatch count.

*   **Example 1:** The code incorrectly filled all pixels. It must only color the corners.
*   **Example 2:** The code incorrectly filled all pixels. It must only color the corners.
*   **Example 3:** The code incorrectly filled all pixels. It must only color the corners.
*   **Example 4:** The code incorrectly filled all pixels. It must only color the corners.
*   **Example 5:** The code incorrectly filled all pixels. It must only color the corners.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grids have varying sizes and contain a border of a single color (non-zero).
  - observation: |
      The output grid is always 3x3.
  - observation: |
     The output grid's corner pixels have color from input grid non-zero border
  - action: |
      Identify the non-zero border color in the input grid.
  - action: |
      Create a 3x3 output grid initialized with zeros.
  - action: |
      Set the corner pixels (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), and (2,2) of the output grid to the identified border color.
  - action: the rest of the pixels remain 0

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find the Border Color:** Examine the input grid's border (top, bottom, left, and right edges). Identify the first non-zero color encountered. This is the "border color".
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new 3x3 grid, initially filled with zeros (representing white).
3.  **Fill Corner Pixels:** Set the color of the pixels at the four corners of the output grid—specifically the cells at positions (0, 0), (0, 2), (2, 0), and (2, 2)—to the border color identified in step 1.
4.  Leave all other output grid pixels as zero.
