            "text": "Okay, here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to improve the natural language program and the subsequent code.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial approach of focusing on the border color and constructing a 3x3 grid was a reasonable starting point. However, the results clearly show that the mapping logic between the input border and the output grid is not entirely correct. The code attempts to map the input's top, bottom, left, and right edges to the output's corresponding edges, but it does not correctly capture all nuances in how the colors should be arranged. It seems that the problem description was misinterpreted, in the prompt, it was said to map top, bottom, left, and right *edges* of the input, but the examples show, and tests confirm, that the rule should consider only top, bottom, left, and right *pixels* of the border.\n\nThe primary issue is that the code uses `min(c, 2)` and `min(r,2)` which limits\nthe expansion of pixels found to the size of 2, even if the size of row or\ncolumn is much bigger.\n\nThe strategy for improvement will involve:\n\n1.  **Refining the Border Mapping:** Instead of directly mapping entire rows and columns, we need to focus on individual border *pixels*. The correct approach should identify the non-zero border color and then strategically place it within the 3x3 output grid based on its position on the *edges* (top, bottom, left, right).\n2.  **Revisiting the Natural Language Program:**  The natural language description needs to be much more precise about how individual border pixels influence the output.\n3. **Consider the border pixel positions:** only the first non-zero pixel found at top, bottom, left and right.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (using code execution when helpful)**\nI'll restate the metrics given in the prompt and use them to guide the fact gathering, natural language generation and code.\n\n- Input and Output grids are given\n- Expected output and transformed output are compared\n- Match: boolean - if the grids are the same\n- Pixels Off: int - number of pixels that are different\n- Size Correct: boolean - if the output has the expected dimensions\n- Color Palette Correct: boolean - if all output colors are present in the input\n- Color Count Correct: boolean - if the number of appearances of each color is the\n  same\n- Score: float - combined metric of differences\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n"
