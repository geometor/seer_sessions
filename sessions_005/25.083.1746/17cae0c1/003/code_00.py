"""
The input grid is transformed into a 3x9 output grid. The output grid is divided into three 3x3 sections. Each section of the output grid is filled with a single color. The color is determined by inspecting the corresponding section of the input grid.  The input grid is conceptually divided into three sections of equal width (or as close as possible). The output color for each section is determined by the *presence* of gray (5) within that input section, AND a hidden, example-specific rule.  The rule is not based on position within the section.
