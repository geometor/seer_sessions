      cols: 9
      cells: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - name: input_section
    type: 2D array
    description: A portion of the input grid.
    properties:
      rows: variable (derived from input_grid)
      cols: variable, approximately 1/3 of input_grid cols
      cells: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      gray_present: boolean (True if color 5 is present)

  - name: output_section
    type: fixed 3x3 array
    description: corresponds to a 3x3 section of the output grid, always filled with a solid color
    properties:
      color: assigned based on grey in corresponding input section
      
actions:
  - name: divide
    description: The input grid is conceptually divided into three sections, based on columns
    agent: system
    input: input_grid
    output: three input_sections

  - name: assign_color
    description: Based on gray in the input_section, a color is assigned
    agent: system
    input: input_section
    output: color (integer)

  - name: fill_output_section
    description: output sections are filled with single solid color
    agent: system
    input: input_section, section_color
    output: output_grid is updated
