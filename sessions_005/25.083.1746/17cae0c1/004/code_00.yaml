observations:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (3x9 in examples)
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - structure: divided into three vertical sections
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: fixed (3x9)
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - structure: divided into three 3x3 sections, each filled with a single color
  - object: gray_pixel (5)
    type: cell
    properties:
      - color: gray
      - position: varies within the input_grid
      - role: key determinant of output colors, its *position* defines section colors

rules:
  - name: section_division
    description: The input grid is conceptually divided into three vertical sections.  The width of each section is determined by integer division of the input grid's width by 3. The position of the gray pixel determines the colors of *all* sections.

    description: >
      The presence and position of the gray pixel (value 5) in the input grid is the primary factor in determining the output colors.
      Each section of the input grid gets assigned three values from an array.
      The three values assigned to the output sections correspond to the index order of the gray (5) within the input.
