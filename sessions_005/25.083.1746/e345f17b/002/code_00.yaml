      The output grid is constructed by inspecting non-overlapping 2x2 regions of the input grid.
      For each 2x2 region, a corresponding cell in the output is determined.
      If the 2x2 contains the color magenta (6), check the last position of magenta in the 2x2 region, reading left-to-right and top-to-bottom.
      If magenta exists in the 2x2 input, put a yellow in the output grid in a cell corresponding to the relative position of magenta, and a white cell (0) otherwise.
