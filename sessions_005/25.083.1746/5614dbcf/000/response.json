Here's my breakdown of the input-output example pair:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The input and output are both grids of digits, representing colors.\n*   The input grids are larger (9x9) than the output grids (3x3).\n*   The output grid seems to be a compressed or summarized version of the input grid.\n*   It appears that only certain colors from the input grid are selected for the output grid.\n*   The structure is that there are squares of 3x3 of the same color, and the center color is taken to create a representative.\n*   The background is always white(0) and does not appear in the output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
