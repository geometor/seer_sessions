The input grids have varying dimensions, but the transformation seems to create a pattern in the output. The top two rows of the input seem to be crucial for the output, while the rest of the input grid (filled with 0s) is seemingly ignored. The transformation appears to duplicate the values in the first two rows of the input, and extends that duplication based on the original height.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
