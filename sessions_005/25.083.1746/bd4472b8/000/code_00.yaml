facts:
  - observation: |
      The input is a 2D grid of integers ranging from 0 to 9.
  - observation: |
      The output is also a 2D grid of integers, with dimensions related to the input dimensions.
  - observation: |
     The first two rows of the input grid seem to dictate the pattern in the output grid.
  - observation: |
      Values from the first two rows are copied.
  - observation: |
     Each row in first two rows in input become repeated rows in the output.

  - relationship: |
      The number of times each of the top two rows are repeated is equal to half the number of rows in input.
      If input has odd number of rows, the number of rows in output equals input rows + 1.
      If input has even number of rows, the number of rows in output equals input rows.
  - action: copy values from input first two rows
  - action: repeat each row to construct output
