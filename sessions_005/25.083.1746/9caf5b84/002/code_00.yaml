  - task: "Identify and outline contiguous regions of the same color with orange."
  - objects:
    - description: "Pixels of various colors forming contiguous regions."
      properties:
        - color: "Integer value (0-9) representing a color."
        - contiguity: "Pixels of the same color connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally."
    - description: 'Orange outlines'
      properties:
          - color: "Orange (7)"
          - location: 'Borders of some original shapes'
  - actions:
    - description: "Replace the colors on the outer edge with orange."
      details: "If a pixel is part of the outer border of a contiguous region of at least 2 of the same color, change it to orange. It seems that 'outer border' is a critical factor - and that the current neighbor count implementation isn't specific enough to distinguish 'inner' from 'outer' regions of a connected component."
