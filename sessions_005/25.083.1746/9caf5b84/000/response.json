The most striking observation is the consistent replacement of certain colors with the color orange (represented by the digit 7). Not all instances of a given color are replaced, suggesting a spatial or contextual rule governs the replacement. It appears the substitution depends on the color of the neighbors.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
