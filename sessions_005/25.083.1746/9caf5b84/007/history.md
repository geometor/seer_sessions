Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was too aggressive in applying the orange border. It essentially colored the entire grid orange because every pixel is either on the edge of the grid or adjacent to a pixel of a different color *somewhere* in the grid. The core issue is that the original logic looked for *any* neighbor with a different color, rather than neighbors within a contiguous region of the *same* color. The code needs to identify contiguous regions of the same color and then apply the orange border *only* around those regions.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Border Detection:** Modify the `is_outer_border` function (or introduce a new one) to specifically identify the border of a contiguous region of the *same* color. This will involve checking if a neighbor has the *same* color, and only considering it part of the region if it does.
2. **Consider Edge Cases:** Make sure we account for single-pixel regions, and fully enclosed shapes.

**Gather Metrics (using code execution if needed):**

I won't use code execution here because the provided results already give enough information:

*   **Example 1:** 20 pixels are incorrect. The transformation incorrectly colored almost all the pixels.
*   **Example 2:** 9 pixels are incorrect. Same problem as Example 1.
*   **Example 3:** 20 pixels incorrect. Same problem.
*    **Example 4**: 17 pixels are incorrect. Same problem.

All show the same systemic problem.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Each example consists of an input grid and a corresponding output grid.
  - observation: |
      The output grid appears to highlight the outer borders of contiguous regions of the same color in the input grid.
  - observation: |
      The border color is consistently orange (represented by the value 7).
  - object: |
      Contiguous Region: A group of pixels of the same color that are directly adjacent (not diagonally).
  - property: color: Each pixel has a color (represented by an integer).
  - property: position: Each pixel has a row and column position within the grid.
  - action: border_identification: The transformation identifies the outer border of each contiguous region.
  - action: color_change: The transformation changes the color of the border pixels to orange (7).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Contiguous Regions:** For each pixel in the input grid, determine the contiguous region of pixels with the same color. A contiguous region is defined as a group of one or more pixels of the same color that are directly adjacent to each other (horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally).
2.  **Identify Border Pixels:** For each contiguous region, identify its border pixels. A border pixel is one that either:
    *   Is on the edge of the entire grid.
    *   Has at least one directly adjacent pixel (horizontally or vertically) that has a *different* color.
3.  **Transform Border Pixels:** In the output grid (initialized as a copy of the input grid), change the color of all identified border pixels to orange (7).
4. **Leave Non-Border Pixels Unchanged:** Pixels that are not part of any border should retain their original color from the input grid in the output grid.
