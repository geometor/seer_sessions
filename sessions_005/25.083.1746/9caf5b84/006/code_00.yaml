facts:
  - observation: |
      Each example consists of an input grid and a corresponding output grid.
  - observation: |
      The output grid appears to highlight the outer borders of contiguous regions of the same color in the input grid.
  - observation: |
      The border color is consistently orange (represented by the value 7).
  - object: |
      Contiguous Region: A group of pixels of the same color that are directly adjacent (not diagonally).
  - property: color: Each pixel has a color (represented by an integer).
  - property: position: Each pixel has a row and column position within the grid.
  - action: border_identification: The transformation identifies the outer border of each contiguous region.
  - action: color_change: The transformation changes the color of the border pixels to orange (7).
