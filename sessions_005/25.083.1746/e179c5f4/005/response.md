"""
The transformation rule involves creating a checkered pattern of blue (1) and azure (8) pixels in the output grid. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. The color of each cell in the output grid is determined by the sum of the row and column indices of the blue pixel in the input grid and the row and column indices of the cell in the output grid. If (blue_row + blue_col + row + col) is even, the cell color is azure (8); otherwise, it's blue (1).
