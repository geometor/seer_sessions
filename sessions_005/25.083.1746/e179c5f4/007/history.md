The transformation rule involves creating a checkered pattern of blue (1) and azure (8) pixels in the output grid. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. The color of each cell in the output grid is determined by the sum of the row and column indices of the blue pixel in the input grid and the row and column indices of the cell in the output grid. If (blue_row + blue_col + row + col) is even, the cell color is azure (8); otherwise, it's blue (1).

Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the assumption that a single blue pixel in the input grid dictates a checkerboard pattern in the output grid. The checkerboard pattern's origin (whether it starts with blue or azure) was determined by the parity of the sum of the blue pixel's row and column indices and the current cell's row and column indices.

The results show that this assumption is incorrect for all three examples. The transformed output consistently creates an alternating pattern of blue and azure, but the *offset* of this pattern is wrong, leading to many incorrect pixels. This suggests the core checkerboard logic is partially correct, but the initialization or starting point of the pattern is miscalculated. It's not simply based on the blue pixel's location.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify the Checkerboard:** Double-check that the alternating pattern (blue/azure) itself is a consistent rule across all examples. We can do this visually and with some simple numpy checks.
2.  **Determine the Pattern's Origin:** The key is to figure out what determines the color of the top-left cell (0, 0) of the output grid. Is it always the same color? Does it depend on the input grid's dimensions or some other property? We'll need to analyze all three input-output pairs.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Once we understand the rule for the origin, we'll rewrite the program to reflect this accurate initialization.
4. **Test and Iterate**

**Gather Metrics and Analyze Examples**
To confirm the checkerboard and find the offset rule, it's easier to just visualize the pattern.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
observations:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    property: dimensions vary across examples
    property: input contains a single blue pixel
    property: output is a checkerboard pattern
    property: checkerboard colors are blue (1) and azure (8)

  - pattern: checkerboard
    description: Alternating blue and azure pixels.
    property: origin (top-left cell) is always azure (8)

  - input:
      property: contains only 0 and 1 values
  - output:
      property: contains only 1 and 8 values

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule creates a checkerboard pattern of blue (1) and azure (8) pixels in the output grid. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. The top-left cell (0, 0) of the output grid is always azure (8). The rest of the grid follows the checkerboard pattern, where each cell's color alternates based on its row and column indices. If the sum of the row and column indices (row + col) is even, the cell is azure (8); otherwise, it's blue (1). The location of the blue pixel within the input is irrelevant.
