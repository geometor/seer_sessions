            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a limited understanding from the first example. The subsequent tests revealed significant flaws in handling diagonals and the \"azure (8)\" pixel transformation. The code incorrectly applies diagonal transformations and struggles with the context-specific rules for the azure pixel. It looks like the top-left to bottom-right diagonals are filled completely with 1, instead of keeping existing 0s, and setting 1s to 0. Also, the code handles some examples of changing the output to a 9 when an 8 is present, but it implements it as very specific example coordinate and grid size checks, which does not generalize. The strategy to solve the errors involves:\n\n1.  **Correcting Diagonal Logic:** Re-evaluate how diagonals are identified and transformed. Separate handling of top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left diagonals is crucial. Differentiate between setting values to 0 when the start is 1, and keeping 0 if the start is a 0.\n2.  **Generalizing Azure Transformation:** Abandon hardcoded coordinates and sizes for the azure transformation. Develop a relative positioning rule (e.g., \"one pixel to the left,\" \"diagonally up-left\") that applies regardless of grid size or the azure pixel's location.\n3. **Prioritizing Transformations:** Since there's an interaction between the diagonal rules and the azure rules ensure rules are executed in the right order. The diagonal transforms should be applied first.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nI will execute some quick python calculations to gather some basic information. I won't spend too much time in the python environment here - most of the information I need is already included in the results that were provided.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
