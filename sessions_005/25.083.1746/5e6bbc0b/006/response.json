            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy to refine the natural language program and address the errors:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code have several significant flaws, leading to mismatches in all four test cases. The core issues stem from:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Diagonal Logic:** The initial logic for handling diagonals, especially the top-left to bottom-right ones, is flawed. It only considers the first pixel of the diagonal and applies a blanket transformation (to 0) across the entire diagonal if that first pixel is blue (1) or white (0). This doesn't account for mixed-color diagonals or other transformation rules that may be present. The top-right to bottom-left diagonal transformation is also overly simplistic, setting *all* pixels on those diagonals to blue (1), regardless of the original input.\n\n2.  **Overly Aggressive Azure (8) Transformation:** The code applies the azure transformation rules in an \"overly aggressive\" manner. It changes all pixels to the left, right, or diagonally, rather than just the intended *single* target pixel. The logic for choosing *which* azure transformation rule to apply also needs careful review.\n\n3. **Incorrect copy of unchanged pixels**: The pixels not affected by any transformations are not being kept as in the input grid.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe core strategy will involve a phased approach:\n\n1.  **Isolate and Correct Azure Transformations:** First, focus *exclusively* on correctly identifying the relationship between the azure (8) pixels and the maroon (9) pixels. We need to determine the precise geometric relationship (left, right, diagonal, etc.) and apply the transformation to *only one* target pixel. The examples show there's one rule per example, but the current code doesn't reflect that.\n\n2.  **Revisit Diagonal Logic:** After fixing the azure transformation, we'll revisit the diagonal logic. The examples suggest a more complex rule than simply checking the first pixel. We need to examine the patterns within the diagonals themselves to figure out the transformation rule.\n\n3.  **Refine Copying of Unchanged Pixels**: After fixing the transformations, we should take care of copying pixels not affected by the transformations.\n\n**Metrics and Facts Gathering (using code execution)**\n\nIt would be useful to have more information on the input and output.\n\n**YAML Fact Identification**\n\n"
