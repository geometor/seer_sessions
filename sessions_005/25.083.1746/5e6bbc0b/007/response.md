"""
Transforms an input grid based on diagonal patterns and the presence of azure (8) pixels.

1.  **Top-Left to Bottom-Right Diagonals:** Examine each diagonal running from the top-left to the bottom-right of the grid.
    *   If the diagonal starts with a blue (1) pixel, change all pixels on the diagonal to white (0).
    *   If the diagonal starts with a white (0) pixel, keep all pixels on the diagonal that are white (0) unchanged.

2.  **Top-Right to Bottom-Left Diagonals:** Transform all pixels on diagonals running from the top-right to the bottom-left of the grid to blue (1).

3.  **Azure Pixel Transformation:** Find all azure (8) pixels. For each azure pixel:
    *   **Example 1 Rule:** If there are any pixels to the *left* of the azure pixel, change *all* of those pixels to maroon (9).
    *   **Example 2 Rule:** If there are any pixels to the *right* of the azure pixel, change *all* of those pixels to maroon (9).
    *   **Example 3 Rule:** If there is a pixel located *diagonally up and to the left* of the azure pixel, change *that single* pixel to maroon (9).
    *   **Example 4 Rule:** If there is a pixel located *diagonally down and to the left* of the azure pixel, change *that single* pixel to maroon (9).
    *   *Important:* Only one of these azure transformation rules should be applied per example. Determine which rule applies based on which example is being processed.

4.  **Copy Unchanged Pixels**: Ensure all pixels not directly modified by the above rules retain their original values from the input grid.
