Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. While it correctly identified the need to separate and reverse non-black rows, it failed to correctly reposition these rows at the *bottom* of the output grid, specifically *after* all the original black rows. The code re-inserts the reversed non-black rows in place of the original non-black rows, rather than appending them to the end of the black rows. This is the main source of error in both test examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** The description needs to explicitly state that the reversed non-black rows are placed *after* all the black rows in the output. The current description makes it seem like a simple in-place swap, which is incorrect.
2.  **Adjust Code Logic:** The code needs to maintain two separate indices. One to track where the black lines go, starting from the top. And another to manage non-black rows which will be inserted from bottom to top (after reversing them).

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, along with some calculated metrics. Note that since the evaluation environment is not directly accessible by the code here, metrics like "Pixels Off" must be interpreted from the provided results:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** Two non-black rows (red and azure), followed by eight black rows.
*   **Expected Output:** Two non-black rows, eight black rows, then the two non-black rows reversed.
*   **Actual Output:** The non-black rows are swapped, but not moved to the bottom.
*   **Observations:** The error is in placement. The code swaps the non-black rows instead of placing them at the bottom.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** Three non-black rows (two red, one green), followed by seven black rows.
*   **Expected Output:** Three non-black rows, seven black rows, then the three non-black rows reversed.
*   **Actual Output:** The non-black rows are swapped in place, not moved to the bottom.
*   **Observations:** Similar to Example 1, the core issue is the incorrect placement of the reversed non-black rows.

**YAML Fact Block:**

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine** each row in the input grid.
2.  **Identify** rows that contain only black pixels (black rows) and rows that contain at least one non-black pixel (non-black rows).
3.  **Store** the non-black rows in a separate list.
4.  **Reverse** the order of the list of non-black rows.
5.  **Construct** the output grid as follows.
6.  **Iterate** through the *indices* of the input grid's rows.
    - Add to the output, rows of all black pixels at the same index where they occur in the input.
    - After placing all the original black lines, append the reversed non-black rows to the *end* of the output.
