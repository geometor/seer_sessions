            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the results and a plan to improve the natural language program and subsequently the code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and code were on the right track, correctly identifying the need to separate black and non-black rows. However, it failed to fully account for the positioning of black rows. It seems all black rows are put on the top, and only then the non-black ones follow. The original program *almost* works. The problem is that the all-black rows need to maintain not only their original order, but also original position relative to other rows. In the given examples, the program places black rows at the top even when the original input had them in between non-black rows.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe core issue is that the original program treats all black rows as a single block to be placed at the top. Instead, we need to preserve the *original positions* of the all-black rows relative to the non-black rows. Instead of separating rows into two groups, we need to keep all rows together, reversing just the non-black ones and leave the black ones unchanged.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's analyze the results more formally:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Two non-black rows (red and blue) followed by eight black rows.\n    *   Expected Output: original order\n    *   Actual Output: Eight black rows, followed by the blue and red rows (reversed).\n    *   Error: Black rows are moved to the top.\n*    **Example 2:**\n    *    Input: two red rows, one green row and seven black rows.\n    *    Expected Output: original order\n    *    Actual output: seven black rows, green row, and two red rows.\n    *    Error: Black rows are moved to top.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
