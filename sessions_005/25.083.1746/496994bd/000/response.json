The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve rearranging rows of the input grid.  Specifically, some rows maintain their positions, and some are moved to the bottom of the grid and the order reversed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This appears to be the last *n* rows where colors in those rows are not black (0). From the first example two rows (8,2) move to the end. In the second example (3,2,2) move to the end.\n2.  **Separate:** Divide the input grid into two groups of rows.\n3.  **Move** Move the bottom *n* non-black rows to end.\n4.  **Reverse** Reverse order of *n* rows moved to the end.\n5.  **Combine**: reassemble the rows to make a single grid by combining top and bottom.\n\nEssentially, we split grid with Top and Bottom segments. Find segment by first looking all the way up-down and keep appending rows when color of the row is not black. After looking up-down, reverse the Bottom segment, and stack Top on top of Bottom segment, which makes the new output grid.\n"
