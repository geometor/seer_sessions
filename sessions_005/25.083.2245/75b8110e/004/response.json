            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the results and a plan to improve the transformation description:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a simple quadrant analysis, extracting the most frequent non-zero color from each quadrant of the input and placing it in the corresponding corner of a 4x4 output grid.  This approach is fundamentally flawed, as demonstrated by the test results. The expected outputs don't follow this logic at all. The output grid seems to extract the quadrants values, but puts them inside a grid that is patterned.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze the input-output pairs, paying close attention to the spatial relationships and color distributions *beyond* simple quadrant frequency. The current approach clearly isn't capturing the core transformation. The size of the output is always 4x4.\n2.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for patterns in how colors are arranged in the output, not just their frequency.  Consider:\n    *   Relative positions of colors in input vs. output.\n    *   Shapes and patterns formed by colors, not just individual colors.\n    *   Symmetry or repetition.\n3.  **Hypothesize and Test:** Formulate a new hypothesis about the transformation rule, and express it in natural language. Iterate.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Hypothesis Development (using tool_code):**\n\nI need to verify that the output size it is always 4x4. I'll check for that. I'll also investigate how well my quadrant hypothesis performed.\n\n"
