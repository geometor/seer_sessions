The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple mirroring, rotation, or direct color substitution. There's a strong positional element:  specific *locations* in the input grid seem to contribute to the output grid, while others are discarded.  The output grid is consistently 4x4. There appear to be \"anchor\" positions or regions in the input that determine the output. The digits/colors in the four quadrants (upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, lower-right) of the input grid seem particularly relevant. The '0' (white) pixels seem to act as separators or background.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1. **Identify Quadrants:** Divide the input grid conceptually into four quadrants, even if the grid dimensions are not even.  These quadrants are defined by the intersection of the horizontal and vertical centerlines, effectively treating the center of the input grid as the origin of a coordinate system.\n\n2. **Extract Corner Pixels:** From each quadrant, identify the non-zero pixel closest to each corner of the input grid and record the non-zero value. *Closest* is defined by minimum Manhattan distance. In case of the tie, the choice is deterministic based on input order.\n\n3. **Populate Output Grid:**  Create a 4x4 output grid. Fill the output grid cells as follows:\n    -   Output (0, 0) = Top-left quadrant's non-zero pixel closest to the upper-left corner of the input grid.\n    -   Output (0, 3) = Top-right quadrant's non-zero pixel closest to the upper-right corner of the input grid.\n    -   Output (3, 0) = Bottom-left quadrant's non-zero pixel closest to the lower-left corner of the input grid.\n    -   Output (3, 3) = Bottom-right quadrant's non-zero pixel closest to the lower-right corner of the input grid.\n\n4.  **Fill in Remaining Cells**: The remaining output grid cells take the value from its nearest, already populated, cell in the output grid. Nearest is defined by Manhattan Distance. Resolve ties by prioritizing, in order, the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right corner values.\n\n"
