"""
1.  **Input:** Receive an input grid of arbitrary dimensions.
2.  **Object Identification:** Identify contiguous regions (objects) of the same color in the input grid. Each object is defined by its color and a bounding box.
3. **Object Selection**: Select a specific set of objects from input. The selection seems to assemble parts of the input grid and arrange them into the output grid. The objects are arranged as if the output grid is imposed on top of the input grid, truncating as needed. The objects may be placed based on color, the top row of the output seems to match colors of unique pixels, and the bottom two rows are filled with colors from the top two rows of the bounding boxes.
4.  **Output Construction:** Create a 3x4 output grid.
5. **Populate Output:** Copy the selected objects from the input to the output grid. Truncate the copied objects to fit within the 3x4 output grid's boundaries.
6. **Return the output grid**
