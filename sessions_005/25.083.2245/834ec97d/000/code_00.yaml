facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: Non-zero values in the input grid trigger the appearance of '4's in the output.
  - observation: '4's appear in the output grid in positions horizontally and vertically adjacent to the original non-zero value in the input, but only for the top and left.
  - observation: The original non-zero values in the input are maintained in the output, except if they are zero.
  - observation: '0' (white) values in the input grid remain '0' in the output grid, unless changed to 4 because of adjacency rule.
