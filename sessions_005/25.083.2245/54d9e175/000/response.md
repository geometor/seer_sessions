Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Objects:** The primary objects appear to be horizontal lines of digits within the grid. The digit '5' seems to act as a separator or boundary. Digits between the '5's are the primary subjects of transformation.
*   **Relationships:** The digits between the '5's maintain their relative order. The '5's remain unchanged. The height of the output grid is always same as input grid. The width of the ouput grid is same as input grid.
*   **Transformations:** The digits between the '5' separators are replaced by other digits. The values between '5's are replaced with different number, the number is always same for given set of numbers. The replacement logic/pattern is not immediately obvious, but it IS consistent within each example. It's a one-to-one mapping, a substitution.
* **Colors**: The color of `5` is grey in input and output. The input values are `0` (white), `1` (blue), `2` (red), `3` (green), `4` (yellow) which get mapped to a new output set of `6` (magenta), `7` (orange), `8` (azure), `9` (maroon).

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: horizontal_line
    description: Sequence of digits bounded by '5' or grid edges.
    properties:
      - digits: List of integers [0-9].
      - length: Number of digits in the line.
      - start_index: Column index of the first digit.
      - end_index: Column index of the last digit.
  - type: separator
    description: Digit '5' that acts as a boundary.
    properties:
      - value: 5
      - position: (row, column)

transformations:
  - type: digit_substitution
    description: Each digit in a horizontal line is replaced by a specific other digit, according to a consistent mapping within each input/output pair.
    properties:
      - input_digit: Original digit.
      - output_digit: Replaced digit.

relationships:
  - type: bounding
    description: Horizontal lines are bounded by separators (5) or by edges of the grid.
  - type: order_preservation
    description: The relative order of digits within a horizontal line is preserved during transformation.
  - type: constant_separtor
    description: The position and the value of 5 remains constant

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Horizontal Lines:** Divide the input grid into horizontal lines. A horizontal line is a sequence of digits that are:
    *   Bounded by the digit '5' on both sides, *or*
    *   Bounded by the digit '5' on one side and the edge of the grid on the other, *or*
    *   Bounded by the edges of the grid on both sides.

2.  **Digit Mapping:** For each horizontal line in input, replace all digits (excluding the bounding '5's) according to these rules:
    *   If the non-five digits between the 5 separators, in order, are `0`, `1`, `0`, replace all of those digits with `6`.
    *   If the non-five digits between the 5 separators, in order, are `0`, `2`, `0`, replace all of those digits with `7`.
    *   If the non-five digits between the 5 separators, in order, are `0`, `3`, `0`, replace all of those digits with `8`.
    *   If the non-five digits between the 5 separators, in order, are `0`, `4`, `0`, replace all of those digits with `9`.

3.  **Preserve Separators:** The digit '5' and its position remains unchanged.

4. **Output.** The output grid dimensions will match those of the input grid.
