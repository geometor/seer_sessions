Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (representing colors). The core transformation seems to involve a mirroring or reflection of a specific *part* of the grid, combined with a color swap of the *mirrored part*. Critically, the part that gets mirrored seems to change, and the colors that are swapped change, in each example, so a key will be tracking those. The position and/or size of the mirrored parts does *not* change.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      The transformation involves a section of the grid being "mirrored" and having its colors remapped.
  - observation: |
      The 'mirroring' in example one looks like taking the leftmost columns
      and moving them the rightmost columns, and the colors get remapped according to the following rule:
        - 6 becomes 1
        - 1 becomes 3
        - 2 becomes 6
        - 3 becomes 2
  - observation: |
      The 'mirroring' in example two looks like taking the rightmost columns
      and moving them to the leftmost columns, and the colors get remapped according to the following rule:
        - 1 becomes 9
        - 9 becomes 6
        - 6 becomes 1
  - observation: |
      The 'mirroring' in example three looks like taking the top rows
      and moving them the bottom rows, and the colors get remapped according to the following rule:
        - 6 becomes 5
        - 5 becomes 6
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Mirroring Type and Source/Destination Colors:**
    *   Observe the changes between input and output.
        * First, note the number of columns/rows that change.
        * Second, note what color changes into another color.
    *   There will be equal numbers of rows that change or columns that
        change.
    *   In example one, two columns change and colors 6 and 1 are swapped with 3 and 2, respectively.
    *   In example two, two columns change and colors 1 and 9 are swapped with 9 and 1, respectively.
    *   In example three, two rows change and colors 5 and 6 are swapped.
2. **Apply changes**: Perform the transformation by changing the column/rows and applying the color swap.
