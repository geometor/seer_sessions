Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The current code attempts a combination of mirroring and color swapping, but it's failing to correctly capture the transformations in all three examples. The main issues seem to be:

1.  **Overly Specific Conditions:** The code has hardcoded conditions (e.g., `cols == 8`, specific row/column checks) that are too tailored to individual examples and don't generalize well.
2.  **Incomplete Color Swaps:** The color swap logic is incomplete and doesn't accurately reflect the changes in all cases. The conditions to apply the color swap rules are not general.
3.  **Incorrect Mirroring:** While the code attempts mirroring, It does not correctly mirror colors in the first two examples.

The strategy should be:

1.  **Identify Common Operations:** Focus on what's *common* across all examples, rather than what's unique.  Mirroring (or reflection) and color swapping seem to be fundamental, but the *conditions* under which they happen need to be generalized.
2.  **Abstract the Conditions:** Instead of hardcoding row/column indices, look for *relationships* between the input and output that trigger the operations.
3.  **Refine Color Swap Rules:**  Develop a more systematic way to determine the color swap rules, possibly based on input/output color pairings.

**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code execution)**

Let's analyze each example in more detail, focusing on the color changes and mirroring. Since manual comparison and analysis are prone to errors, I'll use code to help build the reports and gather more accurate data.

    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)

    print("Input:")
    print(input_grid)
    print("Expected Output:")
    print(expected_output)

    diff = input_grid != expected_output
    print(f"Pixels Different: {np.sum(diff)}")

    color_changes = {}
    for r in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
        for c in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
            if input_grid[r, c] != expected_output[r, c]:
                in_val = input_grid[r, c]
                out_val = expected_output[r, c]

                color_changes[(in_val, out_val)] += 1

    print("Color Changes (Input -> Output):")
    for (in_color, out_color), count in color_changes.items():
        print(f"  {in_color} -> {out_color}: {count}")

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Regions:** The input grid is conceptually divided into two regions:
    *   **Examples 1 & 2:** A "left block" consisting of the two leftmost columns (columns 0-1) and a corresponding "right block" consisting of the two rightmost columns (columns 6-7).
    *   **Example 3:** The top two rows, and the bottom three rows.

2.  **Mirroring (Examples 1 & 2):**
    * The content of the "left block" is mirrored (reflected horizontally) to the "right block".

3.  **Color Swapping:**
    *   **Examples 1 & 2:** After mirroring, specific color swaps are applied *within* the mirrored region (the "right block"). The swap rules are:
        *   Example 1: `6` becomes `1`, `1` becomes `3`, `2` becomes `6` and `3` becomes `2`
        *   Example 2: `1` becomes `9`, `9` becomes `6`, and `6` becomes `1`.
    *   **Example 3:**
        *    Top two rows: Every `6` is changed to a `5`.
        *   Bottom three rows (5-7): every `5` is changed to a `6`.

4. **No change:** The remaining parts of the grid that are not involved in mirroring or stated color-swapping remain unchanged.
