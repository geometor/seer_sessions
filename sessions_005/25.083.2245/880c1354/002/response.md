Okay, here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code (`code_00.py`) was based on the first training example and implements a mirroring and color-swapping mechanism. It attempts to handle both row-wise and column-wise mirroring. However, the results on the subsequent examples show that the code fails to correctly transform the inputs. The primary issues seem to be:

1.  **Incorrect Mirroring Logic:** The code attempts to mirror *either* rows *or* columns, and the decision is based on which one has changes first. This is flawed, as the transformation might involve more complex logic, such as mirroring a *specific* section of rows or columns, not necessarily the entire set.
2.  **Incomplete Color Swap Handling:** The color swapping logic is too simplistic. It identifies *some* swaps, but it doesn't correctly apply them in all cases, and it doesn't capture the full rule governing color changes. It also doesn't account for the context in which swaps are applied (e.g., only within the mirrored region).
3. The strategy for checking if the change happened in either the left or the right is flawed, as shown by the color palette not being correct for the mirrored parts.

The strategy to address these issues involves:

1.  **Re-examining Examples:** Carefully analyze *all* provided examples (1, 2, and 3) to identify the *precise* mirroring and color-swapping rules.
2.  **Refine the Mirroring Detection:** Develop a more robust way to detect *which* part of the input is mirrored and *where* it appears in the output. This likely involves identifying specific boundaries or patterns. The current implementation is overly broad and misses the subtleties of partial mirroring and re-location.
3.  **Precise Color Swap Rules:** Determine the exact conditions under which colors are swapped. This may not be a simple one-to-one mapping; it could depend on position, adjacency, or other factors within the mirrored region.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated code after each significant change to the logic, using all available examples.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution)**

I will use `tool_code` to confirm some observations and gather metrics about the input/output grids. I'll focus on identifying regions that change and the specific color changes within those regions. This will inform us more precisely.


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    changed_rows = []
    changed_cols = []
    color_swaps_global = {}
    color_swaps_changed = {}

    # find color swaps and differences between input and output
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if input_grid[r, c] != output_grid[r, c]:
                if input_grid[r,c] not in color_swaps_global:
                    color_swaps_global[input_grid[r, c]] = output_grid[r, c]
                if r not in changed_rows:
                  changed_rows.append(r)
                if c not in changed_cols:
                  changed_cols.append(c)

    # color swaps in just changed region
    for r in changed_rows:
      for c in changed_cols:
          if input_grid[r,c] != output_grid[r,c]:
            if input_grid[r,c] not in color_swaps_changed:
              color_swaps_changed[input_grid[r,c]] = output_grid[r,c]

    print(f"Changed Rows: {changed_rows}")
    print(f"Changed Columns: {changed_cols}")
    print(f"Global color swaps: {color_swaps_global}")
    print(f"Changed Region Color Swaps: {color_swaps_changed}")
    print("-" * 20)

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Mirrored Regions:**
    *   **Examples 1 & 2:** The two leftmost columns of the input grid are mirrored and moved to the two rightmost columns of the output grid.
    *   **Example 3:** The top two and bottom three rows of the input grid are mirrored.

2.  **Apply Color Swaps (within mirrored regions *only*):**
    *   **Example 1:** Within the mirrored columns, 6 becomes 1, 2 becomes 6, 3 -> 2 and 1 becomes 3.
    *   **Example 2:** Within the mirrored columns, 1 becomes 9, 9 becomes 6, and 6 becomes 1.
    *   **Example 3:** Within the mirrored top rows, 6 becomes 5. Within the mirrored bottom rows, 5 becomes 6.

3. **Output:** The output is otherwise the same as the input grid with the mirrored and color-swapped regions replaced.

**Key Improvements in Understanding**

*   **Precise Region Identification:** The natural language program now correctly identifies the *specific* regions being mirrored and their new locations, rather than assuming whole rows or columns.
*   **Conditional Color Swapping:** The color swaps are now explicitly linked to the mirrored regions. This is crucial.
* **Multiple Mirror Regions** Example 3 has two mirroring actions.
