The most salient feature is the presence of the digit '5' (gray) in the input grids, and its apparent influence on the output grids. The output grids seem to introduce the digit '1' (blue) in proximity to the '5's. There's a sense of expansion or \"filling in\" around the gray pixels. It's also important to recognize all white space is represented by '0'.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"
