If a pixel's color is gray (value 5), it is replaced with a color from a predefined sequence: blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4). The crucial aspect is that the sequence *restarts* at blue (1) for every new column. Within a single column, the replacement proceeds through the sequence (blue, red, green, yellow), wrapping back to blue if the end of the sequence is reached before the end of the gray pixels in that column. Pixels that are not gray remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = output_grid.shape\n\n    # Define the color sequence (blue, red, green, yellow)\n    color_sequence = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    # Iterate through each column of the grid\n    for j in range(cols):\n        # Reset the color index to 0 for each new column\n        color_index = 0\n\n        # Iterate through each row in the current column\n        for i in range(rows):\n            # Check if the current pixel is gray (value 5)\n            if output_grid[i, j] == 5:\n                # Replace the gray pixel with the color at the current color_index\n                output_grid[i, j] = color_sequence[color_index % len(color_sequence)]\n                # Increment the color index for the next gray pixel in this column\n                color_index += 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
