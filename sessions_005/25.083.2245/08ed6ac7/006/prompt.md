"""
The transformation operates on a grid of pixels. The program iterates through each column of the grid. Within each column, it checks each pixel. If a pixel's color is gray (value 5), it is replaced with a color from a predefined sequence: blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4). The crucial aspect is that the sequence *restarts* at blue (1) for every new column. Within a single column, the replacement proceeds through the sequence (blue, red, green, yellow), wrapping back to blue if the end of the sequence is reached before the end of the gray pixels in that column. Pixels that are not gray remain unchanged.
