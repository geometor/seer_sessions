Here's my breakdown of the example pair:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The input and output grids are of the same dimensions (9x9 in both examples).\n*   The input grids contain the digit `0` (white) and `5` (gray).\n*   The output grids contain the digits `0` (white), `1` (blue), `2` (red), `3` (green), and `4` (yellow).\n*   The gray pixels (`5`) in the input are replaced by a sequence of colored pixels (`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`) in the output.\n* The sequence of new colors seem to related to original object order, the 8th column is all 1s, and so on.\n*   It appears the transformation recolors the gray pixels based on their original location.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
