If a pixel is gray (value 5), it's replaced with a color from the sequence: blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4). The sequence *restarts* at blue (1) at the beginning of each column. *Crucially*, within a single column, the sequence *also* restarts at blue (1) for each new contiguous block of gray pixels. A contiguous block is defined as a group of vertically adjacent gray pixels. If there is a non-gray pixel above a gray pixel, it starts a new block, even in the same column. Pixels that are not gray are not modified.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = output_grid.shape\n\n    # Define the color sequence (blue, red, green, yellow)\n    color_sequence = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    # Iterate through each column of the grid\n    for j in range(cols):\n        # Reset the color index to 0 for each new column\n        color_index = 0\n        # Iterate through each row in the current column\n        for i in range(rows):\n            # Check if the current pixel is gray (value 5)\n            if output_grid[i, j] == 5:\n                # Check if it's the start of a new contiguous block\n                if i == 0 or output_grid[i-1, j] != 5:\n                    color_index = 0  # Reset color index for new block\n\n                # Replace the gray pixel with the color at the current color_index\n                output_grid[i, j] = color_sequence[color_index % len(color_sequence)]\n                # Increment the color index for the next gray pixel in this block\n                color_index += 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
