"""
The transformation operates on a grid of pixels. It iterates through each column of the input grid. For each column, it examines each pixel. If a pixel is gray (value 5), it's replaced with a color from the sequence: blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4). The sequence *restarts* at blue (1) at the beginning of each column. *Crucially*, within a single column, the sequence *also* restarts at blue (1) for each new contiguous block of gray pixels. A contiguous block is defined as a group of vertically adjacent gray pixels. If there is a non-gray pixel above a gray pixel, it starts a new block, even in the same column. Pixels that are not gray are not modified.
