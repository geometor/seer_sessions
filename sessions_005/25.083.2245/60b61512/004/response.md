Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improvement.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code attempted to identify 2x2 subgrids containing three yellow pixels and change one of the yellow pixels to orange.  However, the results indicate several errors. The transformation isn't correctly identifying the L-shapes and the corner to be changed. It looks like the logic of checking the four possible corner is not working and causes some extra pixels to change. The code needs adjustments in how the L-shapes are handled and where it is located within a larger object.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine L-shape Identification:** Instead of focusing on corners, think about checking for a 2x2 yellow area and make sure exactly one pixel is not yellow.
2.  **Precise Pixel Modification:** Ensure the correct non-yellow pixel is located and the pixel that needs changing is adjacent.
3.  **Test and Iterate:** After modifying the code, thoroughly test it against all provided examples.

**Gather Metrics and Analyze Examples:**

Let's get more insights on the first two training example failures:


``` python

def analyze_pixel_diff(expected_grid, transformed_grid):
    diff = expected_grid != transformed_grid
    diff_indices = np.where(diff)
    diff_pixels_expected = expected_grid[diff_indices]
    diff_pixels_transformed = transformed_grid[diff_indices]

    print("Indices of differing pixels:", diff_indices)
    print("Expected pixel values:", diff_pixels_expected)

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: L-shape
    color: yellow
    size: 3 pixels
    shape: 2x2 subgrid with one missing pixel

actions:
  - name: identify_L
    description: Locate all 2x2 subgrids within the input grid.
    condition: "The subgrid contains exactly three yellow (4) pixels."

  - name: transform_pixel
    description: "Change a pixel adjacent to the L from yellow to orange."
    precondition: identify_L is true
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through all possible 2x2 subgrids within the input grid.
2.  **L-Shape Identification**: For each 2x2 subgrid, check if it contains exactly three yellow (4) pixels. If it doesn't contain three yellows, continue to the next 2x2 subgrid.
3.  **Identify location of the empty spot**: If there are three yellow pixels, find the coordinates (row, col) of the single non-yellow pixel within that 2x2 subgrid.
4. **Find the yellow to replace**:
    - In example one, the empty spot is top-left and bottom-right, so we replace the one to the left or down respectively.
    - In example two, the empty spot is top-right, so we replace the yellow to the right.
    - In example two, the empty spot is bottom-left, we replace the yellow above.
5. **Transform**: Change the yellow pixel from step 4, located adjacent to the empty spot, to orange (7).
6.  **Output:** The modified grid is the final result.

This improved natural language program focuses on finding the 2x2 section with *exactly* three yellows, and change an adjacent yellow.
