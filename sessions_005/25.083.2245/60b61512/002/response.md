Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improvement.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code were based on observations from the first training example. While it correctly identified the presence of yellow and orange pixels, the adjacency conditions for transforming yellow to orange were too simplistic and did not generalize well to the second example. The code incorrectly transformed yellow pixels in Example 1, and even more so in Example 2. The primary issue is that the conditions for changing a yellow pixel to orange are too broad. The logic needs to be much more constrained to consider L shaped arrangements.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Failures:** Carefully examine where and why the transformations in Examples 1 and 2 went wrong. Pay close attention to the specific configurations of yellow pixels that were incorrectly changed to orange.
2.  **Refine Adjacency Rules:** The current code considers 3x1 and 1x3 blocks, and all kinds of L shaped blocks of yellow pixels, leading to over-transformation. Need to detect the L-shape *corner*.
3. **Hypothesis:** The transform should find 2x2 blocks containing three yellow cells. The corner of an "L" shape of three yellow cells inside a 2x2 subgrid of an input changes from yellow (4) to orange (7).
4. **Test:** Re-run the updated code with L-corner shape detection for changing from 4 to 7.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Let's use code execution to get some basic grid properties for each example, helping us confirm sizes and color distributions.

    color_counts = dict(zip(unique, counts))
    return {
        'shape': grid.shape,
        'color_counts': color_counts
    }

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: pixels (integers 0-9 representing colors)
    properties:
      shape: (9, 9)  # Consistent across all examples
      colors: [0, 4, 7] # black, yellow, orange

transformations:
  - input_color: 4  # Yellow
    output_color: 7  # Orange
    conditions:
      - description: "The yellow pixel is the corner of a 2x2 subgrid where exactly three pixels are yellow. The remaining pixel in the 2x2 block can by any color."
        type: adjacency
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Identify** yellow (4) pixels.
3.  **Conditional Transformation:** For each yellow pixel, examine the 2x2 subgrid for which the pixel is a corner (check all four possible corners - top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).
4. **L-Shape identification:** If exactly three of the four pixels in the 2x2 sub-grid are yellow, change the corner yellow pixel to orange (7).
5.  **Output:** The modified grid is the result.
