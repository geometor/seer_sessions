The primary colors involved are white (0), red (2), and implied are green (3) and blue (1) in the outputs. The red object appears to be the primary actor or seed. The transformation involves an expansion or growth of new objects of different colors above the red object.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

This is our base object.\n2.  **Create the green object:** Above the red object, create lines of green (3) pixels. The first line is the width of the canvas or until it reaches a non zero pixel, each subsequent line of green decreases in width by one from the right, until 6 green lines are created or row 0 of the grid is filled with green.\n3. **Create the blue object:** Starting immediately above the red object, and below the green object, create horizontal lines of blue (1) pixels. Each successive line of blue is one pixel shorter (from the left) than the line below it. Create as many blue lines until the next blue line has zero length or is on top of the green object.\n4.  **Preserve empty space:** Any remaining cells in the grid that are white (0) in the input should remain white (0) in the output.\n\nIn simpler terms: The red line acts as a base. Green lines expand to fill the canvas above the red lines. Blue lines expand upwards from red, decreasing in length, and positioned below the green lines.\n"
