1.  Find the Red Base: Identify the single horizontal red line (color 2) within the input grid. This line acts as the base for the transformation.  Record its row index, starting column, and ending column.

2.  Create Green Triangle:
    *   Starting from the row immediately *above* the red line, and going upwards to the top of the grid.
    *   Fill with green (color 3).
    *   The top most row of the green triangle will start at column 0 and span a width that allows for the green triangle to reach a single point directly above the leftmost point of the red line.
    *   For each subsequent row moving *downwards* towards the red line, the green fill *increases* in width by one, extending one pixel to the *right*.  It always starts at column 0.

3.  Create Blue Triangle:
    *   Starting from the row immediately *below* the red line, and going downwards to the end of the grid.
    *   Fill with blue (color 1).
    *   The first row (adjacent to the red line) starts at column 0 and extends to the ending column of the red line.
    *   For each subsequent row moving *downwards*, the blue fill *decreases* in width by one, starting one pixel further to the *right*.
