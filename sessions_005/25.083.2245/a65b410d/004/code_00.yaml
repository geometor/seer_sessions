      row: varies # Row index of the red line
      start_col: varies # Starting column index
      end_col: varies   # Ending column index
      width: varies     # Length of the red line (end_col - start_col + 1)

  - name: green_triangle
    type: right_triangle
    color: green
    properties:
      base_row: varies  # Row index immediately above the red line

      alignment: left #left aligned with grid
      height: varies    # Number of rows above the red line

  - name: blue_triangle
    type: right_triangle
    color: blue
    properties:
      base_row: varies  # Row index immediately below the red line
      base_width: varies  # Equal to red_line width

actions:
  - action: find_base
    object: red_line
    description: Locate the horizontal red line in the input grid.

  - action: fill_green
    object: green_triangle
    description: Fill a right triangle with green above the red line.
                 The triangle's width decreases by one for each row up, creating green triangles, left aligned.

  - action: fill_blue
    object: blue_triangle
    description: Fill an inverted right triangle shape with blue below the red line.
                  the blue lines begin at the left edge of the grid, and extend to the same length of the
                  red line, and get smaller by one for each row down, until a length of one is reached.
