            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input Grids:** Variably sized grids containing single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. There's no immediately obvious pattern in the distribution of colors within each input grid. The sizes of input grids vary.\n*   **Output Grids:** Consistently 3x3 grids. All output grids share the same structure: a central column of '8' (azure) values, with the top and bottom rows having '0' (white) on either side. It seems all output examples so far show a monochrome 3x3 grid.\n*  **Color Mapping:** Each number has a designated color (given in a color map). I can determine that number by examining the relationship between objects found in each grid.\n* **Possible Transformations:** The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple arithmetic or direct pixel-by-pixel mapping. The output's consistent size and the specific '8' (azure) pattern suggest a higher-level rule, perhaps identifying a specific feature within the input and using its presence/absence or properties to generate the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
