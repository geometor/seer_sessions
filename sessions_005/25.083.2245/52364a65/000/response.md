Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pairs, focusing on identifying the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to involve selective removal or shifting of colored blocks within the grid, specifically non-azure colors adjacent to azure, aligned to a specific edge (the edge is not the same for all). The overall grid dimensions remain constant.

**YAML Block: Facts**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - observation: "Each cell contains a single digit integer from 0 to 9."
  - observation: "Digits represent colors."
  - observation: "Some non-azure (8) colored blocks are modified."
  - observation: "Modified colors are adjacent to azure color (8), horizontally or vertically."
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: variable
      columns: variable
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: same as input_grid
      columns: same as input_grid
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - action: modify_colors
    description: "Change some digits in the input_grid to produce the output_grid."
    details: "Colors (digits) that changes happen near azure (8) areas. Non-azure pixels that are on the edge, next to an azure pixel, are moved one step inwards to be adjacent to its previous location."
  - relation: "Output grid is a modified version of the input grid, with specific color changes near azure areas."
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Locate all azure-colored pixels (value 8) within the input grid.

2.  **Edge Detection:** Find non-azure colored pixels that share edge (horizontal or vertical) with azure and are on one of the 4 edges of the grid (top, bottom, left, right).

3.  **Selective Modification - Left Edge:** For the left edge, if a non-azure pixel is found adjacent to azure and also at the edge, move one step in the direction of its neighboring azure pixel.

4. **Selective Modification - Top Edge:** For the top edge, if a non-azure pixel is found adjacent to azure and also at the edge, move one step in the direction of its neighboring azure pixel.

5.  **Selective Modification - Right Edge:** For the Right edge, if a non-azure pixel is found adjacent to azure and also at the edge, move one step in the direction of its neighboring azure pixel.
6.  **Selective Modification - Bottom Edge:** if a non-azure pixel is found adjacent to azure and is also at the edge, move one step in the direction of its neighboring azure pixel.

7.  **Output:** The resulting grid after these modifications is the output grid. The examples suggest it is possible to have multiple edits in one row or column, and to have no edits.

In summary, the transformation rule involves moving a non-azure pixel next to an azure, but only if the non-azure is also on the edge. Each train example uses a single edge to apply edits (train\_1 is left, train\_2 is top), test will likely also only use one edge (or none?).
