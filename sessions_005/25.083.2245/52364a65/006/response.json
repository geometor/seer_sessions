            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a simplified observation of the first training example. The core idea of identifying a \"moving edge\" adjacent to azure pixels and shifting those pixels is partially correct. However, the current implementation is too restrictive. It only considers cases where *all* non-azure pixels on an edge are adjacent to azure pixels on the *immediate* next column/row. The second example reveals this limitation. It seems that the \"moving edge\" concept needs refinement: it's not the *entire* edge, but rather contiguous \"blocks\" of color within the edge that shift. The code also needs to improve handling multiple such shifts within the same grid.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine \"Moving Edge\" Definition:** Instead of checking the entire edge, the code should identify contiguous blocks of non-azure pixels adjacent to azure pixels. Each such block should be treated as a separate entity for shifting.\n2.  **Iterative Shifting:** The transformation might involve multiple shifts. The code should probably iterate, identifying and shifting blocks until no more shifts are possible.\n3.  **Handle the second example:** examine it in more detail.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Evidence (Example 2):**\n\nLet's use `tool_code` to examine the second example more closely and find which exact conditions should cause a move.\n\n"

The direction towards that adjacent azure defines the \"shift direction\" for that block. If a block borders azure in more than one direction, pick an arbitrary direction.\n3.  **Shift the Block:** Shift the entire contiguous block one step in the shift direction.\n4.  **Fill with Azure:** The original positions of the shifted pixels are replaced with azure (8) pixels.\n5.  **Iterate**: repeat steps 1-4 on the changed grid. Continue iterating and shifting until no more contiguous blocks can be shifted (i.e. no blocks are directly adjacent to any azure pixels).\n6. **Color Invariance:** The only colors in the final output should have been those present in the initial grid.\n\nThis revised natural language program accounts for the shifting of multiple blocks and the iterative nature of the transformation.
