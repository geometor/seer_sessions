facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grids contain objects, defined as contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color.
  - object_identification: |
      Objects are identified by their color and position within the grid.
  - transformation_type: |
     input objects that are 'cross' shaped expand into squares
  - object_interaction: |
      Objects that neighbor at least one white (0) pixel, will expand by 1 pixel
  - action: |
      The core transformation appears to be related to growing / expanding the input shape to create an enclosing square of that color.
