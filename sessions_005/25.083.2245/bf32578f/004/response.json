However, the results show that the code fails to correctly transform the input grids in all three examples. The primary issue seems to be a combination of:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Cross Detection:** The `is_cross_shaped` and `find_cross_center` functions are too restrictive and may not identify all cross-like shapes, especially those that are not perfectly symmetrical or have different arm lengths. It's also finding multiple centers, which is unexpected.\n2.  **Incomplete Expansion:** The square expansion doesn't account for the correct size.\n3.  **Missing Shift:** The code includes placeholders for shifting the expanded square, but the actual shift calculation is not implemented, resulting in the expanded square remaining at the original object's location. It defaults to the center, which is the original location.\n4. **Object selection**: The assumption that the transformation only applies to cross-shaped objects is not always true.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Cross Detection:** Improve the `is_cross_shaped` function to be more flexible in identifying cross-like structures, relaxing the symmetry constraint.\n2.  **Correct Square Expansion**: Ensure the square size is correctly expanded\n3.  **Implement Shifting:** Implement the shift calculation based on the center of the cross and its intended position in the output grid.\n4. Revisit the object selection criteria.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nI'll use a simplified representation of the grids here. Let's re-examine the provided test results.\n\n*Example 1:*\n\n*   Input: A vertical line of blue (8) pixels with some padding.\n*   Expected Output: A larger square of blue pixels.\n*   Actual Output: All zeros.\n*   Problem: detects that there aren't any crosses\n\n*Example 2:*\n\n*   Input: A cross of orange (7) pixels.\n*   Expected Output: A larger square, shifted slightly.\n*   Actual Output: All zeros.\n*   Problem: detects that there aren't any crosses\n\n*Example 3:*\n\n*   Input: A cross of magenta (6) pixels.\n*   Expected Output: A square of magenta pixels.\n*   Actual Output: All zeros.\n*   Problem: detects that there aren't any crosses\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

An object is a contiguous group of pixels of the same color.\n2.  **Check for Cross-like Shape:** Determine if an object is \"cross-like.\" A cross-like object consists of a central pixel with at least three adjacent pixels of the same color, extending in at least three of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). The extensions don't need to be perfectly symmetrical.\n3.  **Expand to Square:** If an object is cross-like, expand it into a solid square. The dimensions of this square should match dimensions of the extended cross shape.\n4.  **Shift (if necessary):** The expanded square should be positioned such that the center of the square corresponds as best as possible with the output grid, and aligned based on the original position of the cross in the input.\n\nThe core idea is to detect cross-like shapes (not necessarily perfect crosses), expand, and maybe shift them. The existing code's concept is mostly correct, but the implementation of detection and shift needs significant refinement.\n"
