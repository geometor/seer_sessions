The output seems to be a 3x3 grid. The presence of these 2x2 red blocks in the input appears to be correlated to the placement of white pixels in the output grid. The output grid is always smaller than the input grids, and it always seems to be 3x3.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The scan depth appears related to input dimensions, approximately half the input height.\n    - If a 2x2 block exists in the first approximate third of input width, place a '1' (white pixel) in first position.\n    -If a 2x2 block exists in the second approximate third of input width, place a '0' in second position.\n      - If a 2x2 block exists in the third approximate third of input width, place a '1' (white pixel) in third position.\n\n4.  **Second Row Generation:**\n    - Perform scan of input rows, with same depth as step 3, offset down by approximately 1/3 the input height.\n     - If a 2x2 block exists in the first approximate third of input width, place a '0' in first position.\n    -If a 2x2 block exists in the second approximate third of input width, place a '1' in second position.\n      - If a 2x2 block exists in the third approximate third of input width, place a '0' in third position.\n\n5.  **Third Row Generation:**\n      - Perform scan of input rows, with same depth as step 3, offset down by approximately 2/3 the input height.\n      - If a 2x2 block exists in the first approximate third of input width, place a '1' in first position.\n      -If a 2x2 block exists in the second approximate third of input width, place a '0' in second position.\n       - If a 2x2 block exists in the third approximate third of input width, place a '0' in third position.\n\n6. **Create a 3x3 output grid.** Fill the output grid with the 0 or 1 values generated from steps 3-5, set any values not determined in steps 3-5 to zero.\n\nEssentially, presence of a 2x2 block within scanning areas of the input grid contribute to a binary value at relative positions in the output grid.\n"
