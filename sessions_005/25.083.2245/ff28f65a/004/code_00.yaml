      cells: all equal to 2 (red)

  - name: region
    type: subgrid of input_grid
    properties:
      row_start: calculated based on output_grid row index
      row_end: calculated based on output_grid row index and input_grid dimensions
      col_start: calculated based on output_grid column index
      col_end: calculated based on output_grid column index and input_grid dimensions

actions:
  - name: find_red_blocks
    input: input_grid
    output: list of top-left corner coordinates of red_blocks

  - name: divide_into_regions
    input: input_grid dimensions
    output: region boundaries (row_start, row_end, col_start, col_end) for each of the 9 regions

  - name: determine_output_pixel
    input: region boundaries, list of red_blocks
    output: 0 or 1 for the corresponding output_grid cell
