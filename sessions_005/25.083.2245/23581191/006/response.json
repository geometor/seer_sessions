            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe code's core logic of identifying key pixels (orange and azure), creating bounding boxes around them, and connecting them with a T-shaped connector is partially correct. However, the positioning and drawing of the connector and bounding boxes are flawed, leading to incorrect outputs in both examples. The connector is not correctly aligned between the centers of the *bounding boxes* and the horizontal line positioning is relative to the key pixel coordinates and not correctly positioned in the vertical. The bounding box centers are drawn at the key pixel locations, not relative to where the connector is drawn.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Bounding Box Placement:** The bounding boxes are placed correctly in the original position of the key pixels, which is good.\n2.  **Connector Alignment:** Correct the vertical connector's position. It should extend from the bottom edge of the top bounding box to the top edge of the bottom bounding box.\n3.  **Horizontal Line position**: Calculate the correct Y of the horizontal based on the vertical extent of the bounding boxes.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example 1):**\n\n*   **Input:** 9x9 grid with an azure (8) pixel at (1, 3) and an orange (7) pixel at (7, 6).\n*   **Expected Output:** A T-shaped connector with 3x3 bounding boxes around the key pixels.\n*   **Actual Output:** Incorrect connector and box placement. The connector starts too high, and ends too low. The horizontal bar doesn't connect bounding boxes.\n*   **Pixels Off:** 29. This is a significant difference, highlighting the positioning errors.\n* The size is the same. The set of colors is correct. The number of each\n    color is incorrect.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example 2):**\n\n*   **Input:** 9x9 grid with an azure (8) pixel at (2, 2) and an orange (7) pixel at (6, 6).\n*   **Expected Output:** A T-shaped connector with 3x3 bounding boxes.\n*   **Actual Output:** Similar errors to Example 1, with incorrect connector and box placement, it starts too high and is too short.\n*   **Pixels Off:** 29. Consistent with Example 1, reinforcing the systematic nature of the errors.\n* The size is the same. The set of colors is correct. The number of each\n    color is incorrect.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
