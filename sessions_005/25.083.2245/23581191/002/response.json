            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, but the test results reveal significant discrepancies between the transformed outputs and the expected outputs. The core issue seems to be in how the bounding boxes are positioned and how the connecting lines are drawn. The current logic doesn't correctly handle cases where the azure (8) and orange (7) pixels are close together or far apart, and the \"T-shape\" connection isn't consistently applied. The placement and overwriting rules for the red connector need more precise definition.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Pixel Differences:** We need to quantitatively assess the differences between the expected and generated outputs. I'll use code execution to calculate the exact pixel differences for each example. This will highlight specific areas of error.\n2.  **Refine Bounding Box Logic:** Ensure the 3x3 bounding boxes are always correctly centered around the identified azure and orange pixels, regardless of their position within the grid.\n3.  **Improve Connector Logic:**\n    *   Clearly define the starting and ending points of the connector lines.\n    *   Specify the \"T-shape\" connection rule precisely, including how it interacts with the bounding boxes.\n    *   Handle cases where the connector might overlap with existing parts of the bounding boxes.\n4. **Object Identification:** I need to clearly identify the concept of bounding box and connector as a single entity for the program.\n\n**Gather Metrics (Code Execution):**\n\n"
