1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Scan the input grid to find all pixels with a value of 8 (azure) or 7 (orange). These are the "key pixels."

2.  **Create Bounding Boxes:** For each key pixel:
    *   If the pixel is azure (8), draw a 3x3 azure (8) square centered on the key pixel.
    *   If the pixel is orange (7), draw a 3x3 orange (7) square centered on the key pixel.

3.  **Connect Bounding Boxes with T-Connector:**
    *   Find the topmost and bottommost key pixels based on their row indices.
    *   Draw a vertical red (value 2) line connecting the bottom edge of the *top bounding box* (topmost key pixel's row + 1) to the top edge of the *bottom bounding box* (bottommost key pixel's row -1), all at the column of the topmost key pixel.
    *  Find the leftmost and rightmost keypixels
    *   Draw a horizontal red (value 2) line at the row of the bottom edge of the bottom bounding box (bottom most keypixel + 1) extending from the column of the leftmost key pixel to the column of the right most key pixel.

4.  **Output:** The output grid contains the bounding boxes with the T-shaped connector, potentially overwritten where bounding boxes overlap the connector.
