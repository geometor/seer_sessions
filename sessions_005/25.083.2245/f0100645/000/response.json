The transformation from input to output appears to involve selective modification of pixel values based on their neighbors and possibly their initial values. The overall grid dimensions remain constant. There's a strong sense of objectness, with clusters of the same color forming contiguous regions. The transformation seems to be modifying these regions or objects.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
