            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. The code propagates the leftmost color across the entire row, regardless of the intended pattern. It's clear from the failed test cases that the transformation rule is more nuanced and involves conditional propagation based on specific color sequences, *not* just the leftmost color. The strategy needs to shift from \"blind propagation\" to \"pattern-aware propagation\". We need to discern a rule which considers not only the leftmost pixel, but the overall arrangement.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine *where* the output differs from the expected output in both examples. This will reveal the conditions under which propagation *should* and *should not* occur.\n2.  **Identify Contextual Rules:** The propagation isn't simply based on the preceding pixel. There's likely a rule about *which* colors trigger propagation and *which* colors block it. The examples suggest changes only after a matching leading color.\n3.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** Formulate a new, more precise description of the transformation, incorporating the contextual rules.\n4.  **Revised Code:** Adapt the Python code to implement the revised natural language program.\n5.  **Iterative Testing:** Test and refine the code, repeating steps 1-4 as necessary.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's analyze each example in detail:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** A 10x10 grid with color 4 on the leftmost column.\n*   **Expected Output:** The color 4 propagates conditionally. It seems to propagate only when there is an adjacent 4 already present and it propagates into color 7.\n*    The propagation of the color 4 often, but not always, stops when it reaches another color (such as 6).\n*   **Transformed Output:** The color 4 propagated across the entire row.\n*  **Differences:** the propagation should be conditional based on the presence of adjacent pixels and color.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** A 9x9 grid with color 9 on the leftmost column.\n*   **Expected Output:** Similar conditional propagation of 9 as in Example 1. 9 propagates into 7 often, but it also propagates into 9. Propagation halts at 8.\n*   **Transformed Output:** Color 9 propagated fully across all rows.\n*  **Differences**: the same as with Example 1, inappropriate full propagation.\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n\n"

It also hints that more complex rules may govern what happens when the preceding pixel doesn't match. The exact nature of \"blocking colors\" still needs further investigation, as it changes between examples.\n"
