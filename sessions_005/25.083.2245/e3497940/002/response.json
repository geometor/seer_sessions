However, it's clear from the errors in Examples 2 and 3 that the logic for extracting and placing the pixels is not entirely correct. The original strategy to extract the pixels to the left of the vertical gray stripe is mostly correct, but it makes a mistake in placing the non-zero colors in their original place. It copies a fixed-width portion (columns 0-3) to the left of the gray stripe. The height of this slice is correct. The strategy needs to account for the varying positions of colored pixels to the gray stripe's left.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Pixel Extraction:** Instead of assuming a fixed width (columns 0-3) for extraction, the extraction width needs to be exactly determined by the location of the gray stripe. The copying logic should take pixels to the left correctly.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using code execution):**\n\nThere is no need to run code at this moment. The provided information about \"Pixels Off,\" \"Size Correct,\" \"Color Palette Correct,\" and \"Color Count Correct\" is enough to assess the results and devise an appropriate update for the natural language program, and consequently the code, in the next step.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
