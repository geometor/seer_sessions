However, there are errors in the copied pixels, specifically in rows where the gray stripe column contains data other than just '5' up to the end of that particular row. The strategy should involve refining which columns of the data to select.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Examine Misaligned Pixels:** Analyze the specific rows and columns where the output differs from the expected output.\n2.  **Refine Column Selection:** Focus on the columns that have colors that are not correct and determine the best way to modify them based on their contents.\n3. **Check for edge cases**: Make sure all parts of each grid and the gray bar has been accounted for.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nI'll use `tool_code` to calculate the differences between the expected and transformed outputs for each example. This will pinpoint the exact locations of the errors.\n\n"

Previous results showed differences, I believe due to extra spaces in my input strings which I fixed by calling strip().\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n\n    *   `diff2=(array([6]), array([2]))`\n    *   `shape2_e=(10, 4)`\n    *   `shape2_t=(10, 4)`\n\n    Shapes are identical. There's a single difference at row 6, column 2. Expected is 3, but transformed is 0. The input has, at row 6, `0 0 0 3 5 0 0 0 0`. Our rule took everything to the left of the first '5'. However row 6 continues with 3 3 after the 5. It appears the gray stripe isn't truly a complete vertical line, but rather the first 5 we see in each row.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n\n    *   `diff3=(array([], dtype=int64), array([], dtype=int64))`\n    *   `shape3_e=(10, 4)`\n    *   `shape3_t=(10, 4)`\n\n    The shapes are correct, and there are no differences.
