objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: variable
      columns: variable
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: 3
      columns: same as input_grid
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)

actions:
  - name: copy_rows
    description: Copy the first two rows of the input_grid to the output_grid.
  - name: create_third_row
    description: >
      Create a new row based on the first row of the input_grid. For each cell in
      the first row, compare its value to the value two cells to its right.
      If they are the same, place a 6 in the corresponding position of the third row
      of the output.
      If not the same, copy the value from the cell in input[0] into the new third row.
      If two cells to the right goes beyond the bounds of the array, keep the
      value from the first row in the third row.
