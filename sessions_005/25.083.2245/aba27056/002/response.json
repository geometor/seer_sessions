            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe current code identifies a contiguous non-zero region (the \"target region\") and attempts to draw a yellow (color 4) outline around it. It distinguishes between enclosed and non-enclosed zeros, but the logic for where the outline is placed and how it handles corners and edges is not entirely correct, as evidenced by the mismatches in the examples. The code sometimes adds yellow to white inside the bounding rectangle of the target, and sometimes at the grid boundary.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Outline Placement:** The primary issue is the precise placement of the yellow outline. We need to carefully consider the conditions under which a '0' (white) cell becomes a '4' (yellow) cell. The current logic uses adjacency to the target and enclosure, but it's not sufficient. We need to correctly handle the \"inside\", \"outside\", and \"edge\" zero pixels of the contiguous shape.\n\n2.  **Corner and Edge Cases:** The current 'is_enclosed' function seems to have issues at corners and edges of the grid, misinterpreting what should be part of the outline. We may need to modify this, or modify the outline placement to be less reliant on it.\n\n3. **Handle Multiple Shapes**: Although not yet encountered, we must consider that there may be tasks with different shapes. Currently, it looks for only the *first* contiguous region and halts.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (without code execution, for now):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   The code fails to create a yellow outline around the *entire* shape, seems confused by inner and outer zeros at edge.\n    *   Significant pixel mismatches (30).\n    *   The inner enclosed \"0\"s are correctly changed to \"4\".\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   The code adds extra yellow pixels at the edge of the grid. The inside/outside logic is flawed.\n    *    Pixel mismatches (16).\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   The code fails to correctly outline the bottom part of the shape and adds additional 0's.\n    *   Pixel mismatches (10).\n\n**YAML Fact Extraction:**\n\n"

This is the \"target region.\" If there isn't one, the output is same as input.\n\n2.  **Create the Outline:**\n    *   Iterate through all cells of the grid.\n    *    If a cell has a value of '0' (white) and is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a cell in the \"target region\", check if it is *not* an internal '0'.\n        * A '0' is *internal* if it and all cells adjacent to it (up, down, left, right) are either:\n            * also '0'\n            * within the target_region, or\n            * on the very edge of the grid\n    *    If a cell has a value of 0 and it *is* adjacent, *and* is not internal, change its value to '4' (yellow).\n\n3.  **Fill Enclosed Areas:** After creating the outline, iterate over the *original* grid.\n      * Find '0' (white) pixels, that are not part of the outline, that are entirely enclosed by the target_region. \"Enclosed\" means that any path from the '0' pixel to the edge of the grid *must* pass through a pixel from the target region.\n      * Change all the pixels identified as enclosed to color '4'.\n\nThe key improvement is the more precise definition of the outline placement and how the \"enclosed zeros\" rule differs. The current code mixes both up.\n"
