Transforms an input grid by identifying all contiguous regions of non-zero color and creating a yellow (color 4) outline around each of them. The outline is placed on '0' (white) cells that are directly adjacent to the target region. Areas of '0' that are completely enclosed by each target region are also filled with yellow (color 4).
