Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, aiming to discern the transformation logic:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The transformation seems to involve identifying regions of a specific color within the input and potentially adding or modifying pixels around those regions based on shape and adjacency. A new color (4, yellow) is introduced in the output, seemingly outlining or highlighting the identified regions.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The digit '0' (white) appears to be a background color.
  - observation: A new color '4' (yellow) is introduced in the output.
  - observation: Color '4' often appears adjacent to the non-zero color from the input, sometimes within an object of color '0' and sometime replacing '0'.
  - object: target_region
    properties:
      - color: Varies (7 in train_1, 6 in train_2, 3 in train_3)
      - shape: Contiguous block of the same color.  Can be rectangular or irregular.
    actions:
      - identified: The target region is identified within the input grid.
  - object: outline
    properties:
      - color: '4' (yellow)
      - location: Adjacent to the target_region.
    actions:
      - created:  An outline of color '4' is created.
      - placement: The placement rule is not fully clear. Sometimes color 4 *replaces* 0, sometimes it appears *within* a region of '0's.
  - relationship: outline is adjacent to target_region
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Target Region:** Find all contiguous regions of non-zero color in the input grid.  Each example seems to have one primary color besides '0'.
2. **Create Outline:** For each identified region, generate an "outline" of color '4' (yellow).
3. **Outline application rule:**
   - If a '0' cell is adjacent to the identified target region, and it is not enclosed by 0's, change to '4'
   - if a '0' cell is adjacent to the identified target region, and it is enclosed by '0's, change every '0' in the enclosed region to '4', except keep '0' at the border of the output image
   - other '0' cells in the border of the output image keep unchanged.

The trickiest part is the exact logic for where the outline (color '4') is placed, particularly its interaction with the background color '0'. The rule may involve something beyond simple adjacency. There might be a "filling" aspect or a directional component. The current examples suggest a specific pattern to when 0s get turned into 4s.
