            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, which involved outlining non-zero regions and filling enclosed zeros with yellow. However, the subsequent examples reveal that the outlining and filling logic isn't universally correct. The code over-applies the yellow outline, extending it to all sides of non-zero areas, not just adjacent to zeros, and seems to have issues correctly identifying \"internal\" zeros.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Definition of \"Outline\":** The current implementation creates an outline on *all* sides of a non-zero region. The examples show the outline should only be placed where a '0' (white) cell is adjacent to the non-zero region.\n2.  **Refine \"Internal Zero\" Detection:** The current `is_internal_zero` function seems too aggressive, possibly classifying zeros as internal when they shouldn't be. We will use a better approach to flood fill and find if internal zero reach the edge.\n3. **Consider Example-Specific Differences** The code needs to perform correct on all three examples, not only on the first one.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection and reasoning, preparing for code execution if needed):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Observation:**  The outline is too extensive. It covers the entire top and left sides of the orange region, whereas it should only be present where the orange region borders a zero.\n    *   **Expected Outline:** The outline should only appear where a 0 is adjacent to a non-zero color.\n    *   **Internal Zeros:** The two zeros inside the orange region should be filled.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Observation:** Again, the yellow outline is over-applied, appearing on all sides of the magenta shape. The single 0 inside the area is correctly identified as a fully surrounded 0.\n    *   **Expected Outline:** Only present where '0' borders the non-zero region.\n    *   **Internal Zeros:** The internal zero is correctly identified and colored yellow.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *    The outliner is correct.\n    *    There is an incorrectly classified enclosed zero in the lower left and one on the lower right.\n\n**YAML Block:**\n\n"
