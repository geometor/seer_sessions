The transformation seems to involve identifying regions of a specific color within the input and potentially adding or modifying pixels around those regions based on shape and adjacency. A new color (4, yellow) is introduced in the output, seemingly outlining or highlighting the identified regions.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Each example seems to have one primary color besides '0'.\n2. **Create Outline:** For each identified region, generate an \"outline\" of color '4' (yellow).\n3. **Outline application rule:**\n   - If a '0' cell is adjacent to the identified target region, and it is not enclosed by 0's, change to '4'\n   - if a '0' cell is adjacent to the identified target region, and it is enclosed by '0's, change every '0' in the enclosed region to '4', except keep '0' at the border of the output image\n   - other '0' cells in the border of the output image keep unchanged.\n\nThe trickiest part is the exact logic for where the outline (color '4') is placed, particularly its interaction with the background color '0'. The rule may involve something beyond simple adjacency. There might be a \"filling\" aspect or a directional component. The current examples suggest a specific pattern to when 0s get turned into 4s.\n"
