However, it fails to correctly apply the outlining and filling rules in all cases. The primary issues seem to be:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Outlining:** The code doesn't place the yellow outline correctly. It seems to be missing the concept of outlining *around* the identified shape and also misinterprets when to draw and not to draw the border pixels.\n2.  **Incomplete Filling:** It does not correctly and completely identify the \"internal\" zeros (zeros surrounded by the target region), and the condition to determine an \"inner zero pixel\" is flawed.\n3. **Premature Return**: The function `find_target_region` has a premature return. It assumes only one region.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine `find_target_region`:** Remove premature return to ensure it finds all target shapes.\n2.  **Refine `is_internal_zero`:** Revise logic. The current implementation does not capture the surrounding concept, and should use a flood-fill like algorithm from the current 0 to the border. If border is reached, not internal.\n3.  **Refine Outlining Logic:** Revisit the conditions for placing the yellow outline. Make sure that it checks if there is a pixel with the shape color in the neighborhood. Also make sure to not paint border over inner 0s.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nI will use manual analysis since I do not have the capability to execute this given code as a \"tool\".\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: Orange (7) rectangle.\n    *   Expected Output: Yellow outline around the rectangle, and yellow fill inside the inner zeros.\n    *   Actual Output: Original input.\n    *   Errors: Outline missing, inner zeros not filled.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: Magenta (6) shape resembling a plus sign, with a missing corner, and two disjoint lines.\n    *   Expected Output: Yellow outline following the shape's contour, and yellow fill of the inner zeros.\n    *   Actual Output: Original input.\n    *   Errors: Outline missing, inner zeros not filled.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: Two blue (3) rectangles at top and some blue at the bottom.\n    *   Expected Output: Yellow outline where zeros border each of the blue shapes. Bottom two zeros at left/right corner are not surrounded.\n    *   Actual Output: Input unchanged.\n    *   Errors: Outline missing, inner zeros not filled.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Multiple disjoint shapes may exist.\n2.  **Outline Target Regions:** For each identified shape:\n    *   Iterate through all zero-valued (white) pixels in the grid.\n    *   If a white pixel is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a pixel that belongs to the target shape, change the white pixel to yellow (4), *unless* the zero cell is internal.\n3.  **Fill Internal Zeros:** For each identified shape, find all zero-valued pixels that are completely enclosed by the shape. A zero-valued pixel is \"enclosed\" if, starting from that pixel, it's impossible to reach the edge of the grid by moving only through other zero-valued pixels (without crossing any shape). Change the enclosed zero-valued pixels to yellow (4).\n4. Return modified output grid.\n\n"
