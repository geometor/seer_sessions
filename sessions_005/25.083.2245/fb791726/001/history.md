Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements**

*   **Input Grids:** The input grids seem to contain a few non-zero pixels (representing colors other than white) arranged vertically, with the rest of the grid being zero (white). The non-zero pixels maintain their relative vertical positions.
*   **Output Grids:** The output grids appear to be an expanded version of the input grids. The key transformations are:
    *   The original non-zero pixels are maintained in their original vertical positions, but shifted to the left.
    *   The width of the output grid is double the width of the input grid.
    *   A horizontal line of green (3) pixels is added below each original non-zero pixel. These green lines span the entire width of the *output* grid.
    *   The original columns of the non-zero input are maintained in their x-position.

**YAML Fact Block**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids contain vertically arranged non-zero pixels.
  - observation: Output grids are double the width of the input grids.
  - observation: Non-zero input pixels maintain their vertical positions in the output.
  - observation: Each non-zero input pixel generates a horizontal green line in the output.
  - observation: Green lines span the full width of the output grid.
  - property: input_width
    description: The width of the input grid.
  - property: output_width
    description: The width of the output grid (twice the input width).
  - property: non_zero_pixels
    description: List of (row, column, color) tuples for non-zero pixels in the input.
  - action: duplicate_width
    description: Doubles the width of the grid.
  - action: draw_green_line
    description: Draws a horizontal line of green (3) pixels below a given row, spanning the output width.
  - relationship: output_width = 2 * input_width
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Determine Input Dimensions:** Measure the width and height of the input grid.
2.  **Calculate Output Dimensions:** The output grid's width is double the input grid's width. The output grid's height is determined by considering the location of input pixels, below each a new row is created and spans the doubled width of the output.
3.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Scan the input grid and record the row, column, and color of each non-zero pixel.
4.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an output grid filled with zeros (white) with the calculated dimensions.
5. **Iterate Non-Zero Pixels**
    - For each non-zero pixel:
        - copy each identified pixel from the input and add it to the output, adjusting for the new row positions.
        - Draw a horizontal line of green (3) pixels in the row immediately below the pixel's row index and across the entire output width.
6.  **Return Output Grid:** The resulting output grid is the transformed result.
