            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the idea of doubling the width and adding a green row after each row containing non-zero pixels. However, the results reveal a misunderstanding of how rows are handled. The original program seems to *repeat* any original row that has a non-zero entry, not just take the row once. Also, the row duplication logic must be changed: instead of duplicating all non-zero rows, the code should *move* any row with a non-zero entry *down* to accomodate the green filler rows.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Gather Metrics:** Use code execution to calculate precise metrics on mismatches. Verify dimensions, color counts, and pixel-by-pixel comparisons.\n2.  **Refine Observations:** Update the YAML documentation with more accurate object descriptions and relationships.\n3.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** Re-describe the transformation rule, incorporating the insights from all examples. The core idea is inserting green rows *between* the original rows, and doubling the grid width.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using manual analysis for now, code execution to confirm):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (6, 6)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (4, 6)\n    *   Mismatched Rows: All rows except the ones containing only green pixels.\n    *  Specifically the non-zero pixel rows are duplicated rather than copied once.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (6, 6)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (12, 12)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (8, 12)\n    *   Mismatched Rows: similar to example 1\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (7, 7)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (14, 14)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (4, 14)\n    *  Mismatched Rows: similar to example 1\n\n**YAML Documentation (Facts):**\n\n"
