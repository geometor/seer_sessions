"""
The transformation rule involves doubling the width of the input grid. For each row in the input grid that contains at least one non-zero pixel, the non-zero pixels in the row are copied to a new row in the output grid, maintaining their original color and positions relative to the start of the row. Immediately after this copied row, a row of green pixels is added to the output grid.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the idea of doubling the width and adding a green row after each row containing non-zero pixels. However, the results reveal a misunderstanding of how rows are handled. The original program seems to *repeat* any original row that has a non-zero entry, not just take the row once. Also, the row duplication logic must be changed: instead of duplicating all non-zero rows, the code should *move* any row with a non-zero entry *down* to accomodate the green filler rows.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Gather Metrics:** Use code execution to calculate precise metrics on mismatches. Verify dimensions, color counts, and pixel-by-pixel comparisons.
2.  **Refine Observations:** Update the YAML documentation with more accurate object descriptions and relationships.
3.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** Re-describe the transformation rule, incorporating the insights from all examples. The core idea is inserting green rows *between* the original rows, and doubling the grid width.

**Gather Metrics (using manual analysis for now, code execution to confirm):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (6, 6)
    *   Actual Output Shape: (4, 6)
    *   Mismatched Rows: All rows except the ones containing only green pixels.
    *  Specifically the non-zero pixel rows are duplicated rather than copied once.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (6, 6)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (12, 12)
    *   Actual Output Shape: (8, 12)
    *   Mismatched Rows: similar to example 1

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (7, 7)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (14, 14)
    *   Actual Output Shape: (4, 14)
    *  Mismatched Rows: similar to example 1

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double the Width:** The output grid's width is twice the input grid's width.

2.  **Iterate Through Rows:** Examine each row of the input grid.

3. **Check for Non-zero:** Copy and translate any row that contains one or more non-zero entries, preserving relative position of elements within that row.

4.  **Insert Green Rows:** For each row in the input grid which contains a non-zero value, insert a row of green pixels (all 3s) with a width equal to the *output* grid's width into the *output* grid. These green rows are inserted *into* the set of translated input rows.

In other words, the non-zero rows from input are interspersed with new green rows
in the output grid. The final height is the number of input rows plus the original
number of non-zero input rows.
