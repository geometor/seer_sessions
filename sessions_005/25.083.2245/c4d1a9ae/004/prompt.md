"""
Transforms an input grid based on horizontal and vertical neighbor rules.

Horizontal Neighbor Rule (Same Color):
    - If a pixel has left and right neighbors of the same color:
        - If neighbors are 4 (yellow) and the current pixel is 4, change to 6 (magenta).
        - If neighbors are 0 (white) and the current pixel is 0, change to 3 (green).
        - If neighbors are 0 (white) and the current pixel is 4, change to 9 (maroon).

Vertical Neighbor Rule (Example 2 Specific):
    - If a pixel is 0 (white) and:
      -  the pixel above is 0 and the pixel below is NOT 0, change to 3
      - the pixel above is NOT 0 and the pixel below IS 0, change to 3
      -  the pixel above and the pixel below are both 0, change to 3.

No Change Rule:
    - If none of the above, pixel's value remains unchanged.
