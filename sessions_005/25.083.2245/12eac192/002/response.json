It only replaced all instances of blue (1) with green (3). While this might have seemed correct based on the first example alone, the subsequent examples reveal a more complex pattern. It's not *all* blues that are replaced, but blues in specific locations or contexts. The errors highlight a need to consider spatial relationships and potentially object-based rules, rather than a simple color substitution. My strategy is to:\n\n1.  Analyze the spatial distribution of the errors. Are the incorrect replacements clustered? Do they form shapes?\n2.  Look for patterns in *where* the blues are being replaced and where they are not.\n3. Consider creating some helper functions, since this will be used again.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**\n\nI need to understand *why* some blues are changed and others aren't. Let's examine the examples where the transformation was incorrect, focusing on the differences between the expected output and the actual output of the current code.\n\n"
