Okay, here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to address the errors:

**General Assessment:**

The errors are `IndexError: index out of bounds`. This indicates that the `reflect_shape` function is attempting to access indices outside the valid range of the `reflected_grid`. This likely stems from incorrect calculations when inserting the reflected shapes (horizontal, vertical, and corner reflections) into the `reflected_grid`. The alternating offset logic (`h_off`, `v_off`, `hv_off_h`, `hv_off_v`) seems to be the primary culprit, causing the indices to go beyond the allocated size. The initial size calculation of `reflected_grid` might also be inaccurate. It assumes there needs to be rows and columns added to reflect the initial shape but is failing to account for the single cells which may get reflected.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Size Calculation:** The `reflected_grid` size should be carefully recalculated. Instead of simply doubling and subtracting 1, we need to correctly deduce size of reflection based on the shape.

2.  **Simplify Offset Logic:** The alternating offset logic is complex and error-prone. We need to simplify how reflections are placed, possibly using a more direct indexing approach based on the original shape's dimensions. We want to ensure that insertions never go out of bounds.

3.  **Test with Small Examples:** Debugging with smaller, simpler shapes will be easier than using the full input grids.

4. **Check the non zero assumptions**: The current program assumes that only the non-zero parts of the center are part of the reflection - may want to check all colors and see if that is needed.

**Gather Metrics and Analyze Examples:**

Let's analyze each example to understand the input, expected output, and where the code likely fails. We will focus on the center shape and dimensions and see how they change in reflection.

    """Finds row indices with non-zero elements."""
    rows = []
    for i, row in enumerate(grid):
        if any(val != 0 for val in row):
            rows.append(i)
    return rows

def get_center_col_indices(grid):
    """Finds column indices with non-zero elements."""
    cols = []
    for j in range(len(grid[0])):
        if any(grid[i][j] != 0 for i in range(len(grid))):
            cols.append(j)
    return cols

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Center Shape:** Find the smallest rectangular region within the input grid that contains all non-zero pixels. This is the "center shape". If the input grid contains only zeros return it unchanged.

2.  **Reflect the Shape:** Create three reflected copies of the center shape:
    *   **Horizontal Reflection:** Mirror the shape across its vertical axis.
    *   **Vertical Reflection:** Mirror the shape across its horizontal axis.
    *   **Corner Reflection:** Mirror the shape both horizontally and vertically (equivalent to a 180-degree rotation).

3.  **Construct the Output Grid:**
    *   The original center shape will occupy the center pixels of the output.
    *   Place the horizontal reflection to the right, placing each non-zero pixel on alternating sides horizontally.
    *   Place the vertical reflection below, placing each non-zero pixel on alternating sides vertically.
    *   Place the corner reflection in the bottom right corner, placing each non-zero cell in an alternating grid pattern (checkerboard like).

4. **Determine output grid size**:
    * The output grid is created by combining the center shape, its reflections, and padding of zeros.

Example to clarify:

Consider input:


```
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 5, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```


Center shape is `[[5]]`.

1.  Horizontal reflection: `[[5]]`
2.  Vertical reflection: `[[5]]`
3.  Corner reflection: `[[5]]`

Combined and padded, the output will look like this.

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 5, 0, 5],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 5, 0, 5],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Another example.

Input:

```
[0, 4],
[0, 0],
[0, 3],
[0, 3],
[0, 0]
```


Center:


```
[4],
[0],
[3],
[3],
[0]
```


1. Horizontal Reflection


```
[4],
[0],
[3],
[3],
[0]
```


2. Vertical Reflection:

```
[0],
[3],
[3],
[0],
[4]
```


3. Corner Reflection

```
[0],
[3],
[3],
[0],
[4]
```

The output is created by overlaying reflections


```
[0, 3, 0, 4],
[0, 3, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 3],
[0, 0, 0, 3],
[0, 4, 0, 0]
```
