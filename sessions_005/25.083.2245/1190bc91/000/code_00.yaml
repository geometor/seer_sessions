facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - description: Initial state of the grid
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - description: Transformed state of the grid, derived from the input
  - object: center_row # train 1 and 2 seem to suggest center row
    properties:
     - type: row_index # or indices
     - description: important row that anchors transform
  - object: non_zero_pixels
    properties:
      - type: list of coordinates
      - description: Locations of pixels in the input grid that are not 0
  - action: reflection
    properties:
      - type: spatial transformation
      - description: Parts of the input appear to be reflected in the output, possibly both horizontally and vertically, but in a shape-based, not value-based way
  - action: expansion
    properties:
      - type: spatial transformation
      - description: Elements in the input are expanded outwards in the output, not just mirrored
  - action: filling
    properties:
        - type: value propagation
        - description: The expanded areas are 'filled in', potentially by a propagation rule related to reflection of the shape
