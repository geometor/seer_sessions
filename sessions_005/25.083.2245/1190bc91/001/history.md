Okay, I'm ready to analyze these examples and try to figure out the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program description:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** Grids of varying sizes containing single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors. There are often large areas of '0' (white/background). There often appears to be a "center row" or scattered pixels.
*   **Output:** Grids that appear to be derived from the input, but with significant changes. The output grids seem to "expand" and "reflect" elements from the input, and the "center" plays a significant role. The shapes of the digits also matter.
* **Transformation:** Seems to involve a combination of reflection, expansion, and possibly some form of "filling" based on the input's non-zero pixels. The transformation does not seem to be a simple rotation or mirroring, because the shapes of the input influence the output, not the exact color values.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - description: Initial state of the grid
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - description: Transformed state of the grid, derived from the input
  - object: center_row # train 1 and 2 seem to suggest center row
    properties:
     - type: row_index # or indices
     - description: important row that anchors transform
  - object: non_zero_pixels
    properties:
      - type: list of coordinates
      - description: Locations of pixels in the input grid that are not 0
  - action: reflection
    properties:
      - type: spatial transformation
      - description: Parts of the input appear to be reflected in the output, possibly both horizontally and vertically, but in a shape-based, not value-based way
  - action: expansion
    properties:
      - type: spatial transformation
      - description: Elements in the input are expanded outwards in the output, not just mirrored
  - action: filling
    properties:
        - type: value propagation
        - description: The expanded areas are 'filled in', potentially by a propagation rule related to reflection of the shape

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Center:** Locate the "center" of the input grid. In examples 1 and 2, this is visually apparent and appears to be where non-zero values are present. Example 3 is trickier, but seems to "reflect" around where numbers are present.
2.  **Shape Reflection/Expansion:** The non-zero pixels in the "center" are used as a basis for a combined reflection and expansion operation. Imagine taking each non-zero section of the center and "reflecting" it both horizontally and vertically *based on its shape*, creating a mirrored, expanded version of that shape.
3.  **Alternating Pattern:** The expansion and reflection appears to incorporate the surrounding '0' values in an alternating manner. When a non-zero pixel "reflects" its shape, neighboring zero positions take the value from a previous location in the pattern. It is important to recognize shapes, not values, and alternating reflection of the shape in a horizontal and vertical direction.
4. In the first two examples, the "center row" is expanded and reflected, to above and below. The "shape" of the numbers is used for the reflection, not the specific values.
5. In example 3, the reflection is centered in the space between existing numbers.

This program describes a complex, spatially-aware transformation. It's not a simple pixel-by-pixel operation, but rather a shape-based reflection and expansion, with a propagation rule for filling the expanded regions, and alternating pattern. The key is understanding that the *shape* of the numbers in the "center" is what's being reflected and expanded, not the numbers themselves.
