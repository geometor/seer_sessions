            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as requested:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a small input grid into a larger output grid. The core operation seems to be replicating and expanding colored pixels from the input grid into larger blocks of the same color in the output grid. The placement and size of these expanded blocks appear to be systematic and related to the original pixel's position. It appears that each non-zero pixel in input is expanded to a n x n block of pixels, and 0 (white) in input are maintained as blocks of 0 (white) of same size. The size of the expansion seems to be different between the examples.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The relation between size of input vs output tells us about the size of expansion.\n    *   Example 1: input: 3x3, output 9x9. Expansion = 3x3\n    *   Example 2: input 3x2, output 6x6. Expansion = 2x2\n    *   Example 3: input: 3x3, output: 15x15. Expansion = 5x5\n\n2.  **Iterate through Input Grid:** For each pixel in the input grid:\n\n    *   **If the pixel is non-zero:** Create a square block of the same color in the output grid. The block's dimensions are determined by the expansion factor. The top-left corner of the block is positioned based on the original pixel's coordinates, scaled by the expansion factor.\n    *   **If the pixel is zero:** Create a similar block size in the output filled with value 0.\n\n3.  **Output:** Return the expanded grid.\n\nEssentially non-zero value in the input grid is expanded by the expansion\nfactor, into a square block of the same color in the output grid, and zero in\ninput are expanded into matching sized block of 0s.\n"
