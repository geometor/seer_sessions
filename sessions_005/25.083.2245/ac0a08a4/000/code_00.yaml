facts:
  - observation: Input grids are small, output grids are larger.
  - observation: Non-zero pixels in the input grid correspond to blocks of the same color in the output grid.
  - observation: Zero pixels in the input grid correspond to possibly white blocks of matching size in the output.
  - relationship: Output grid dimensions are a multiple of the input grid dimensions.
  - property: Colors in the output grid are the same as their corresponding input pixels.
  - action: Expansion of non-zero pixels into square blocks.
  - action:  Zero (white) pixels are expanded into rectangular area, keeping them white
