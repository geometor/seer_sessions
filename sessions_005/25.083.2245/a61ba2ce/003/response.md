"""
The program identifies connected components (objects) of non-zero pixels in the input grid. Each object's shape and size are preserved. The objects are then arranged in a 2x2 grid in the output. The objects are ordered first by the row (top to bottom) and then by the column (left to right) of their top-left corner in the input grid. The top-left corners of the objects in the output are fixed at (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), and (2,2).
