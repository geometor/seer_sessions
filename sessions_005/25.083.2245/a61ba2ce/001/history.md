Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into a smaller grid. The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of the input grid, retaining only certain colored pixels while discarding others (primarily the background color '0'). The order and relative positions of the non-zero colored pixels are significant. Specifically, connected components of the same color within input are considered. The output arranges these components differently.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: large (input), small (output)
      - elements: pixels (represented by digits 0-9, corresponding to colors)
  - type: pixel_group
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - connectivity: contiguous (pixels of the same color forming a connected component)
      - shape: irregular

actions:
  - type: identify
    description: Identify connected components (pixel groups) of the same non-zero color in the input grid.
  - type: extract
    description: Extract the identified pixel groups.
  - type: rearrange
    description: Rearrange the extracted pixel groups into a specific layout in the output grid.
  - type: discard
    description: Discard all pixels of color '0' (background).

relationships:
  - input_grid: Contains multiple pixel_groups.
  - output_grid: Contains a rearranged subset of pixel_groups from the input_grid.
  - pixel_group: Consists of connected pixels of the same non-zero color.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify and Extract:** Scan the input grid and identify all distinct, contiguous groups of non-zero (i.e., color other than white) pixels.  Each such group is considered a separate object.
2. **Order:** Arrange these groups in column major order.
3. **Arrange in Output:** Create new 2x2 block.
4. **Layout:**  Place first identified item into top-left 2x2, with the first pixel of item to be at top-left corner.
    For each identified item, scanning from left to right, and top to bottom:
        - skip background pixels (0).
        - put connected color pixels into the output.
        - fill non-connected component space with zeros
5. Return the new 2x2 block.

Essentially the program is taking blocks of the same non-zero color, preserving their 2D shape, and arranging them into quadrants, skipping zeros, and stops when out of input pixels.
