Okay, let's analyze the results of the first code iteration and strategize for improvement.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code has several issues, primarily related to the sorting and positioning of the extracted objects. The code attempts to sort by color priority (blue, azure, green, red), and positions objects into a 2x2 grid. The color priority is correct, but positioning is causing issues with the examples and order is not always deterministic within a color.

Here's the plan:

1.  **Analyze Errors:** Carefully examine the pixel differences in each example. This will pinpoint exact locations where the output deviates from the expectation.
2.  **Refine Sorting:** The sorting logic needs revisiting. It's not just about color; spatial arrangement within the input grid is crucial, likely top-to-bottom, left-to-right within the same color.
3.  **Revisit Positioning:** The 2x2 grid assumption is too rigid. It's more about preserving relative shapes and positioning based on sorted order.
4.  **Output grid size**: may not be 4x4 - derive that from the examples

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all connected components (objects) of non-zero pixels in the input grid.  Each object is defined by its color and the set of pixels it occupies.
2.  **Sort Objects:** Sort the objects based on these criteria, in order of precedence:
    *   **Color Priority:**  Blue (1) comes first, then Azure (8), Green (3), Red (2), Yellow(4).
    *   **Top-to-Bottom:** Among objects of the same color, prioritize those with a higher top-most row (smaller row number).
    *   **Left-to-Right:** If the top-most row is the same, prioritize objects with a smaller leftmost column number.
3. **Determine Output Size:** The output is always 4x4 for these examples.
4.  **Place Objects:**  Iterate through the sorted list of objects. Place each object into the output grid, maintaining its original shape. The positioning of the object should be determined based on its order within the sorted object array. The first object in the array is placed at (0,0), the second at (0,2), the third at (2,0) and the fourth at (2,2). If any cell within the placed object exceeds the bounds of the 4x4 grid it is still placed but only the parts within the bounds are rendered.
5. **Fill:** If fewer than four components/objects, leave the remaining cells of the 4x4 grid black (filled with 0).
