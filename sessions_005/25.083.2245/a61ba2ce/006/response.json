            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the first code iteration and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code has several issues, primarily related to the sorting and positioning of the extracted objects. The code attempts to sort by color priority (blue, azure, green, red), and positions objects into a 2x2 grid. The color priority is correct, but positioning is causing issues with the examples and order is not always deterministic within a color.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze Errors:** Carefully examine the pixel differences in each example. This will pinpoint exact locations where the output deviates from the expectation.\n2.  **Refine Sorting:** The sorting logic needs revisiting. It's not just about color; spatial arrangement within the input grid is crucial, likely top-to-bottom, left-to-right within the same color.\n3.  **Revisit Positioning:** The 2x2 grid assumption is too rigid. It's more about preserving relative shapes and positioning based on sorted order.\n4.  **Output grid size**: may not be 4x4 - derive that from the examples\n\n**Metrics Gathering (Example 1)**\n\n"

Place each object into the output grid, maintaining its original shape. The positioning of the object should be determined based on its order within the sorted object array.
