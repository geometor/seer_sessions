  - description: "Input grids are 2D arrays of integers (0-9)."
  - description: "Each integer represents a color."
  - description: "Output grids have the same number of rows as the input grids."
  - description: "The number of columns in the output grids is based on the number of columns in the input."
  - objects:
    - name: "Input Column"
      properties:
        - "Contains digits 0-9"
        - "May contain the digit '2'"
    - name: "Output Column"
      properties:
        - "Contains only digits '0' or '1'"
      actions:
        - if: "Input Column contains '2'"
          then: "Output Column is filled entirely with '1'"
        - if: "Input Column does not contain '2'"
          then: "Output column contains 1 for each non-zero entry and zero for each zero entry, truncated from the bottom"
  - description: "Contiguous non-zero values are counted at the bottom of each input column"
  - action: The number of contiguous non-zero values from the bottom of input columns not containing the value 2 are skipped/truncated from the output
