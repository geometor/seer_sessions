Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation logic. Here's my breakdown of the task, including my perception, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements of the Task**

The task involves transforming a grid of digits (representing colors) into another grid of digits. The input grids contain digits 0, 2, and 7, while the output grids contain only digits 0 and 1. The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid (fewer columns). It appears that the transformation is reducing sections of columns into single digits. The presence of the '2' (red) digits seems to be a key factor since all columns containing 2 are replaced entirely by 1.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids contain digits 0, 2, and 7.
  - observation: Output grids contain only digits 0 and 1.
  - observation: Output grids are smaller in width than input grids.
  - observation: The number of rows are similar, differing at most by 1.
  - relationship: Columns in the input containing the digit '2' correspond to columns in output filled with the digit '1'.
  - relationship: Columns in the input NOT containing the digit '2' correspond to a mix of '1' and '0'
  - object_property: Digit '2' (red) acts as a critical marker.
  - action: Input columns are transformed.
  - action: The transformation rule changes depending upon the presence of 2.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Iterate** through each column of the input grid.

2.  **Check** if the current column contains the digit '2'.

3.  **If** the column contains '2':
    *   Create a corresponding column in the output grid.
    *   Fill the entire output column with the digit '1'.

4.  **Else (If** the column does *not* contain '2'):
    *    Create a corresponding column in the output grid.
    *   Iterate through the rows from top to bottom skipping the last `n` rows. Where `n` is equal to the number of contiguous non-zero entries at the bottom of column in the input grid
    *   If the cell in the input column is not `0`, place a `1` in the corresponding row and column of the output.
    *   If the cell in the input column is `0`, place a `0` in the corresponding row and column of the output.

In summary, columns containing '2' are entirely replaced with '1's in the output. Columns not containing '2' have some of their lower non-zero elements truncated, and the others mapped to '1' where the element is not '0' and to '0' when the element is zero.
