Okay, I'm ready to analyze these input-output pairs and try to figure out the transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   The output grids are significantly larger than the input grids. Specifically, the output grid appears to be 5 times the width and height of the input grid.
*   The pattern of the input grid seems to be replicated and tiled in the output grid.
*   There are no rotations or reflections; the orientation of the input is preserved in the output.

**YAML Block: Facts**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - description: Represents the initial state
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - description: Represents the transformed state, larger than the input grid
  - relationship: output_grid_size
    description: The output grid is 5 times larger in both dimensions (width and height) than the input grid.
  - action: replication
    description: The input grid's pattern is replicated to form the output grid.
  - action: tiling
    description: Multiple copies of the input are tiled, adjacent to each other.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Determine Input Dimensions:** Get the width (number of columns) and height (number of rows) of the input grid.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new empty grid, with a width equal to 5 times the input grid's width and height.
3. **Tile input grid:** iterate row by row, column by column through the *input grid*. For each value, fill a corresponding 5 x 5 cell area in the *output grid* with the value.

Essentially input value at input\[row,col] becomes a 5x5 block of that same value in the output grid at output\[row\*5:row\*5+5, col\*5:col\*5+5]
