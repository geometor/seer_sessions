              Columns 0 and 1 are concatenated. Columns 2 and 3 are concatenated.
              Each of these concatenated column sets is then repeated to 2.5 times original length of the
              concatenated set, resulting in a width of 5 times the input width per
              concatenated set. These sets are interleaved to become the output row.
