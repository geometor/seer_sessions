A new color \"4\" (yellow) is introduced in the output, related to the position and/or arrangement of the original colors. The transformation isn't a simple mirroring or rotation. It seems to be a selective replacement or marking based on spatial properties.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The \"mirrored\" position means the pixel at `(rows - 1 - row_index, cols - 1 - col_index)` for a pixel at `(row_index, col_index)`.\n3.  **Conditional Replacement:** If the mirrored pixel has a different color or contains a zero, leave the non-zero pixel unchanged.\n4.  **Replace with 4:** If the condition in Step 3 is met, replace the original, and mirrored non-zero pixels, with color 4 (yellow).\n\nEssentially, the program identifies diagonally symmetrical single color pixels about the center of the grid and, replaces them with the color 4. other non-zero color remain unchanged.\n"
