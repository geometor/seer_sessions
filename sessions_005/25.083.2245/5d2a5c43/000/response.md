Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output examples to discern the underlying transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits (0-9), representing colors.
*   The digit '1' (blue) appears to be a constant feature in all input grids, always in the center.
*    The digit '4' (yellow) is present in all the input examples.
*    The digit '8' (azure) appears to be connected to the locations of the original yellow '4's in input.
*   The output grids have a smaller dimension than the input grids. It seems the height is equal, the width is lower.
*   The output grids consist primarily of '8' (azure) and '0' (white).

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - contains_digits: [0, 1, 4]
      - center_digit: 1
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - contains_digits: [0, 8]
      - height: "same as input_grid"
      - width: "less than the input_grid"
  - name: yellow_pixels
    type: pixel_group
    properties:
      - color: 4 (yellow)
      - location: "variable in input_grid"
  - name: azure_pixels
    type: pixel_group
    properties:
     - color: 8 (azure)
      - location: "corresponds to yellow_pixels in input, but shifted"

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    description: "Yellow (4) pixels in the input seem to trigger the appearance of Azure(8) pixels."

relationships:
    - type: "spatial"
      from: "yellow_pixel in input"
      to: "azure_pixel in output"
      details: "Azure pixels replace yellows pixels on a certain subgrid"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Subgrid:** In the input grid find the borders made out of yellow, from the leftmost yellow vertically and horizontally.
2.  **Replace:** Within this subgrid, change all yellow (4) pixels to azure (8).
3.  **Output:** Return this subgrid of the same height as input, but using only columns delimited by the leftmost vertical yellow border, and the vertical line of 1s in the input.

Essentially, the transformation identifies the leftmost boundary of connected yellow (4) pixels, and the central vertical blue (1) line. It converts a region within those bounds, changing yellows (4) to azure (8) to create the output.
