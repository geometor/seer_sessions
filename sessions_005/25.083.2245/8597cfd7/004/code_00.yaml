task: "Create a 2x2 grid based on vertical line colors."
objects:
  - name: InputGrid
    type: Grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing colors.
  - name: RedLines
    type: List
    description: A list of column indices where red (2) vertical lines are found.
    properties:
        - lengths: "lengths of the contiguous segments of red pixels in each column"
  - name: YellowLines
    type: List
    description: A list of column indices where yellow (4) vertical lines are found.
    properties:
        - lengths: "lengths of the contiguous segments of yellow pixels in each column"
  - name: OutputGrid
    type: Grid
    description: A 2x2 grid filled with the selected color.

actions:
  - name: FindVerticalLines
    input: InputGrid
    output: [RedLines, YellowLines]
    description: Identifies the column indices of red and yellow vertical lines.
  - name: DetermineOutputColor
    input: [RedLines, YellowLines]
    output: Integer
    description: >-
      Selects the output color (2 or 4) based on comparing max length of red vs yellow vertical
      line segments. If max(RedLines.lengths) >= max(YellowLines.lengths), output is 2. If
      max(YellowLines.lengths) > max(RedLines.lengths), output is 4.
  - name: CreateOutputGrid
    input: Integer
