The results across all three examples show a consistent pattern of errors, indicating that the logic for handling even and odd rows is flipped. The expected output shows that odd-indexed rows should alternate, and even-indexed rows should be all blue.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify the pattern:** Double-check the observation about even and odd rows by examining the expected outputs again.\n2.  **Invert the Logic:** Modify the natural language program to reflect the correct even/odd row behavior. We expect even rows to be all blue, odd rows to alternate blue and black, beginning with blue.\n3. **Prepare YAML and Program**: Create the requested YAML and Natural Language Program.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Verification (using manual inspection since I cannot run code against this provided example outputs directly ):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 5x5\n    *   Expected Output: Odd rows (0, 2, 4) are all blue. Even rows (1, 3) alternate blue and black.\n    *   Transformed Output: Even rows alternate blue and black. Odd rows are all blue.\n    *   Observation: The logic is inverted.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 7x7\n    *   Expected Output: Odd rows (0, 2, 4, 6) are all blue. Even rows (1, 3, 5) alternate blue and black.\n    *   Transformed Output: Even rows alternate blue and black. Odd rows are all blue.\n        Observation: The logic is inverted.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input size: 9x9\n    *  Expected Output: Odd rows(0,2,4,6,8) are all blue, and Even rows(1,3,5,7) alternate blue and black\n    *   Transformed Output: Even rows alternate blue and black. Odd rows are all blue.\n    *   Observation: The logic is inverted.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
