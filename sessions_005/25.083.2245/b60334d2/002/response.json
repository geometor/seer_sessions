            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on observations from the first training example only. It correctly identified the importance of gray pixels and attempted to create a pattern involving blue pixels around them. However, the results on the second example reveal shortcomings in the logic. The code doesn't fully capture the alternating pattern and the extent of mirroring observed in the expected outputs. The strategy should focus on refining the pattern generation, specifically how blue and gray pixels alternate and mirror each other both horizontally and vertically, based on the positions of the initial gray pixels. The code seems to perform some vertical mirroring and extend the blue pixels to other parts.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze both training examples to pinpoint the exact rules governing the placement of gray and blue pixels. Pay close attention to the symmetry and mirroring.\n2.  **Refine Pattern Logic:** Modify the code to accurately reflect the alternating pattern. Consider both horizontal and vertical relationships to the original gray pixels.\n3.  **Iterative Testing:** After modifying the code, test it against both training examples again. It's crucial to ensure that changes improve the results for *both* examples, not just one.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis (using code execution):**\n\nTo better understand the patterns, let's extract some metrics. I will compare all the given input and outputs of the train examples.\n\n"
