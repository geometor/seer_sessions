"""
The transformation identifies gray pixels in the input grid and generates an alternating pattern of gray and blue pixels in the output grid. The pattern starts from the gray pixels' positions, extending horizontally and vertically. Horizontal alternation involves placing gray and blue pixels (5, 1) bidirectionally from the original gray pixel positions. A vertical extension places blue pixels one row below and one row to the left of the gray/blue alternating pattern. Empty rows in the input remain empty.

Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and the corresponding code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identified the core concept of alternating gray and blue pixels based on the location of gray pixels in the input. However, it failed to accurately capture the vertical extension pattern and the precise conditions for extending. The vertical extension seems to be consistently misapplied, placing blue pixels incorrectly and insufficiently capturing the intended diagonal downward extension. The main strategic improvement involves a precise re-evaluation of the vertical extension rules. The code tried extending to two cells downwards but the output show that the extension depends on the presence of the horizontal alternations.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Vertical Extension:** Carefully analyze how the blue pixels are placed vertically in relation to the gray-blue horizontal alternations in *all* examples. The current implementation uses a simple offset, which is clearly incorrect.
2.  **Conditional Extension:** The vertical extension is likely *conditional* on the presence of a gray or blue pixel in the row above. The current code extends unconditionally, leading to errors.
3.  **Precise indexing:** current code always subtract 1 in the vertical extension, we must examine this assumption.
4. **Empty row preservation:** Ensure that empty input rows are always empty output rows.

**Metrics Gathering and Analysis:**

I will use manual analysis, since python tool use is not relevant, at least not
now, I have the results of the current code.

**Example 1 Analysis:**

*   **Input:** Gray pixels at (1,2), (1,7), (5,2), (7,6).
*   **Expected Output:** Alternating horizontal patterns, with downward diagonal extensions. The extension are only on the left side of the gray pixel. The extension is of one blue pixel down-left one position from the horizontal gray/blue cells
*   **Transformed Output:** Incorrect vertical extension. Too many blue pixels, and in the wrong places. The horizontal alternation appears mostly correct, but vertical rules cause large deviation
*   **Key Discrepancy:** Vertical extension logic is flawed.

**Example 2 Analysis:**

*   **Input:** Gray pixels at (2,3), (5,6), (7,2).
*   **Expected Output:** Similar pattern as Example 1, with horizontal alternations and diagonal extensions.
*   **Transformed Output:** Same as Example 1, the vertical extension rule is placing the blue pixel one row down and one col to the left, but with errors.
*   **Key Discrepancy:**  Vertical extension is incorrect.

**YAML Fact Representation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Contains pixels represented by integers.
  - object: pixel
    type: integer
    values: [0, 1, 5]
    description: Represents colors. 0 is empty, 1 is blue, 5 is gray.
  - action: horizontal_alternation
    description: Gray pixels in the input trigger a horizontal sequence of alternating gray and blue pixels.
    input: row with gray pixel(s)
    output: row with alternating gray and blue pixels, starting from the gray pixel's position.
  - action: vertical_extension
    description: Extends blue pixels diagonally downwards and to the left from *each* pixel in the horizontal alternating pattern.
    input: row with alternating gray and blue pixels
    output: row(s) below with blue pixels placed diagonally left.
  - observation: empty_rows_preserved
    description: rows without gray pixels in input remain entirely empty (all 0) in output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros.
2.  **Empty Row Preservation:** If a row in the input grid is completely empty (all zeros), the corresponding row in the output grid remains empty.
3.  **Horizontal Alternation:** For each row in the input grid:
    *   Locate all gray pixels (value 5).
    *   For each gray pixel found:
        *   Create a horizontal alternating sequence of gray (5) and blue (1) pixels in the output grid.
        *   The sequence starts at the gray pixel's position.
        *   Extend the sequence to the left, alternating colors, until the edge of the grid.
        *  Extend to the right, alternating colors (starting with blue), until the edge.
4.  **Vertical Extension:** For each row that contains the horizontal alternating sequence, and for *each* pixel *within* that sequence:
    *   Place a blue pixel (1) in the cell one row *below* and one column *to the left* of the current pixel in the sequence.
    *  If the cell is outside grid bounds, stop extension.
5. Return the output grid.
