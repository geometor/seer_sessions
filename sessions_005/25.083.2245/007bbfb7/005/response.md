The input 3x3 grid is replicated to form a 9x9 output grid. The columns of the input grid (0, 1, 2) are replicated in the output grid in blocks. Each block of 3 columns in the output is a copy of all the input rows in sequence. The input column order in the output columns is as follows: 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2. The rows of the input grid (0, 1, 2) are replicated in the output grid in blocks. Each block of 3 rows is the sequence of the input rows in the order 0, 1, 2. The input row blocks are copied to the output rows in the order 0, 1, 2.
