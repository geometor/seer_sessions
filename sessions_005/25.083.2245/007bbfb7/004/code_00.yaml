observations:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    properties:
      - cells contain single digit values (0-9) representing colors.

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    properties:
      - cells contain single digit values (0-9) representing colors.
      - appears to be a transformation of the input grid.

  - action: transformation
    type: replication
    description: The input grid is replicated to form the output grid.  The replication is not a simple tiling. The precise order of rows and columns needs to be determined, however, it is certain that the input grid is used to build the output.
    details:
      - input_rows: 3
      - input_cols: 3
      - output_rows: 9
      - output_cols: 9
