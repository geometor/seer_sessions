"""
The transformation rule involves identifying connected components (objects) of non-zero colored pixels in the input grid and moving them down within their respective columns, treating '0' as empty space.  Connectivity includes orthogonal and diagonal adjacency. The relative vertical order of objects within a column is preserved, as is the horizontal (column) position of each object.
