objects:
  - description: Connected components of non-zero pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The color value of the object (1-9).
      - pixels: A list of (row, col) tuples representing the object's pixels.
      - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle containing the object.
      - column_affiliation: The original columns the object's pixels belong to.

actions:
  - name: MoveDown
    description: Objects move down within their original columns.
    constraints:
      - column_restriction: Movement is strictly vertical within the object's original column(s).
      - stacking: Objects stack on top of each other at the bottom of the grid.
      - order_preservation:  The relative vertical order of objects within a column is maintained.
      - merging: when objects with common columns are stacked on top of each
        other, they take on the color of the object they are moved on top of.
