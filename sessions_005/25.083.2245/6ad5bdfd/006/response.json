            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe current code attempts to identify connected components (objects) and move them downwards within their columns. The primary issue is that the objects are not correctly \"stacking\" and merging, and their placements relative to the correct columns are wrong. The code's sorting and placement logic needs significant adjustment. It seems the x-location of the objects are drifting.\n\nHere's the strategy:\n\n1.  **Column-Based Processing:** Reinforce the concept that objects move *only* within their original columns.\n2.  **Correct Stacking Order:** Ensure objects stack correctly at the bottom, preserving their relative vertical order within each column.\n3. **Merging Behavior**: The merging logic is not right. No real merging occurs in the output.\n4.  **Object Identification:** Use `get_objects` function for robust object extraction.\n5.  **Refine Placement:** Improve the logic for determining the final row position of each object, considering the presence of other objects below it.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nI will use `tool_code` to gather specific metrics about the mismatches, focusing on object positions and colors.\n\n"

An object can belong to multiple columns if it spans across them.\n\n3.  **Column-wise Processing:** For each column, process the objects independently.\n\n4.  **Vertical Ordering:** Within each column, maintain the relative vertical order of the objects.
