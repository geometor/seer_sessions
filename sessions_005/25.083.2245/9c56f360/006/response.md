Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a limited understanding derived from the first example. The subsequent tests reveal discrepancies, primarily related to the movement and positioning of the green (3) pixels. The code moves green pixels to the *leftmost* available empty space to the left of the leftmost azure pixel, but it doesn't account for all the constraints that can be derived. The updated output indicates we should refine how empty spaces are used, especially with adjacent greens.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, focusing on where the code's output differs from the expected output. Pay close attention to the relative positions of azure, green, and white pixels.
2.  **Refine Movement Rule:** The core issue is the "leftmost available" rule. It needs more nuance. We need to prioritize filling the available spaces to be closest to the left most azure. We also need to consider moving only green pixels that aren't *adjacent* to the leftmost azure.
3.  **YAML Fact Documentation:** Create a structured YAML representation of the observed objects, properties, and actions. This will help formalize the transformation process.
4.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to incorporate the refined movement rule and any other observed constraints.

**Metrics and Observations (using print statements):**

I don't need `tool_code` for this part. I'm analyzing given information:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Pixels Off: 4
    *   Mismatches occur in rows 2 and 4. In Row 2, Green should move two spaces, not three. In Row 4, the Green should move all the way to the left adjacent to the left most Azure.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Pixels Off: 6
    *    Mismatches occur in rows 5 and 6. Row 5 needs to move the green to the left. Row 6 has the same issues as Row 5.
*   **Example 3:**
    *    Pixels off: 14
    *    Many mismatches. Similar pattern to before, with green needing to "fill in" spaces to the left of leftmost azure, while avoiding positions adjacent to that azure.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: azure_pixel
    value: 8
    property: anchor # Acts as a reference point

  - name: green_pixel
    value: 3
    property: movable # Can be moved under conditions

  - name: white_pixel
    value: 0
    property: empty_space # Represents a potential destination

actions:
  - name: move_green
    condition: green_pixel is not horizontally adjacent to azure_pixel AND green_pixel is right of leftmost azure
    action:
      - find_target_position: leftmost available white_pixel to the left of the leftmost azure_pixel
      - move green_pixel to target_position, replace green pixel at origin with white
```


**Revised Natural Language Program:**

For each row in the input grid:

1.  **Locate Anchors:** Find the leftmost azure (8) pixel. If no azure pixel exists, skip the row.
2.  **Identify Movable Objects:** Find all green (3) pixels. If there are no green pixels, skip the row.
3.  **Identify Available Spaces**: Find all white (0) pixels to the left of the leftmost azure pixel.
4.  **Conditional Movement:** Iterate through each green (3) pixel.
    *   Check if it is horizontally adjacent (left or right) to *any* azure (8) pixel.
    *   **IF NOT adjacent:**
       * Find available white pixels in order, moving from the azure pixel towards the left.
       *   Move the green pixel to the *first* available white (0) space to the left of the leftmost azure (8).
        *  Replace the green pixel's original position with a white (0) pixel.
5. Repeat Step 4 for all green pixels.
