Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first example and doesn't generalize well to other cases. The main issue is that it only considers moving green (3) pixels to the empty spaces *immediately* before the leftmost azure (8) pixel. It doesn't correctly handle cases where green pixels should be moved further to the left, filling any available '0' spaces, even if these zero spaces are not contiguous. Additionally, the adjacency check is too simplistic, and needs some clarification. It appears in some cases we are only looking at horizontal adjacency.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine the insertion logic:** Instead of only looking at contiguous '0's directly before the leftmost '8', we need to consider *all* '0's to the left of the leftmost '8'.
2.  **Clarify Adjacency:** Specify that we are only checking horizontal adjacency (+/- 1 in columns).
3. **Prioritize movement:** Move the greens that are furthest away from the leftmost '8' first.
4. **Handle edge cases**: Ensure the code works correctly even with no green, no azure, multiple azure, and all possible ordering.

**Gather Metrics (using visual inspection and the supplied data, no code execution needed at this stage):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Pixels Off: 4
    *   Errors:
        *   Row 2: Green (3) moved to the wrong position (index 0 instead of 5)
        *   Row 4: Green (3) should have moved to index 2, but did not move at all.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Pixels Off: 6
    *   Errors:
        *  Row 5: Green (3) pixels did not move to available '0's to the left.
        *  Row 6: One Green (3) moved correctly to index 3, the other should move to index 4

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Pixels Off: 14
    *   Errors: Numerous errors related to incorrect positioning of moved green (3) pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
objects:
  - color: green
    value: 3
    role: movable
    constraints:
      - moves_left: true
  - color: azure
    value: 8
    role: anchor
    constraints:
      - leftmost_priority: true
  - color: white
    value: 0
    role: empty_space
    constraints:
      - fillable: true

actions:
  - move:
      object: green
      destination: empty_space
      condition: "to the left of leftmost azure in the same row, only if not horizontally adjacent to an azure pixel, and if azure exists in the row"
      priority: "fill empty spaces from left to right"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

For each row in the input grid:

1.  Identify the leftmost azure (8) pixel. If no azure pixel exists in the row, skip the row.
2.  Identify all green (3) pixels in the row. If no green exists, skip to the next row.
3.  Identify all white/empty (0) pixels to the left of the leftmost azure (8) pixel.
4.  Iterate through the green (3) pixels. For each green pixel:
    *   Check if it's horizontally adjacent (immediately to the left or right) to *any* azure (8) pixel.
    *   If it's *not* horizontally adjacent, move it to the *leftmost available* white/empty (0) space to the left of the leftmost azure (8).
    *   If a green pixel is moved, replace it with an empty(0) in the original position.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4.

This process ensures all possible "3"s that can move will move, and that they will move into all available "0"s, from left-to-right.
