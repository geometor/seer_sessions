Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 2D grids containing single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to involve repositioning of specific digits/colors, specifically '3' (green) appears to be moved. Other digits remain largely in place. The key seems to lie in understanding where green ('3') objects are being moved to. It looks like the green is inserted before a section of white in many of the cases. The background seems to be white, and then azure, and then green.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
