            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of focusing on \"changing pixels\" (pixels different from their most common neighbor) has merit, but it's not the complete solution. The code correctly identifies these pixels but fails to arrange them in the output grid according to the actual transformation rule. The output grid dimensions are also not being determined correctly. The strategy relies too heavily on the number of changed pixels and direct neighbor, without looking on the relative positions and repetitions. It's clear from the examples that a simple count or list of changing pixels is insufficient.  We need to consider the *spatial relationships* and *patterns* of these changes, and perhaps identify core \"objects\" or regions that are being represented in a different way.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:**  Instead of simply counting changing pixels, we need to visually inspect the input and output grids side-by-side.  Look for spatial patterns, repetitions, or object-like structures that are being transformed. Focus on *how* the changing pixels are arranged in the *output*, not just *that* they are changing.\n2.  **Refine Object Identification:**  The concept of \"changing pixels\" is a good starting point, but we may need to define \"objects\" more broadly.  An object might be a contiguous region of the *same* color, or it might be defined by a specific *pattern* of color changes.\n3.  **Output Grid Construction:** The current logic for determining output grid dimensions is flawed. We need a more robust way to determine the size and shape of the output grid, likely based on the identified objects or patterns.\n4.  **Positional Mapping:** Focus needs to shift to how input positions map to output positions. The current code doesn't explicitly consider this mapping.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Example Analysis (using visual analysis, no code execution needed for this high-level analysis):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 10x10\n    *   Output: 2x5\n    *   Changing Pixels (visual estimate): Several (6, 9, 2).  The output contains values from the borders between colors.\n    *   Observations: The output seems to represent a condensed version of the borders between different colored regions in the input.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 10x10\n    *   Output: 3x5\n    *   Changing Pixels (visual estimate): Several (5, 7, 8, 9).\n    *    Observations: Similar to Example 1, the output extracts border information, however the row arrangement seems important. The third row in the output seems correlated with a row toward the bottom of input.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 10x10\n    *   Output: 5x5\n    *   Changing Pixels: More than previous examples.\n    *    Observations: The output shows the borders and a pixel (5) that is surrounded by a border.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Diagonal neighbors are not considered for border definition.\n2.  **Extract Border Colors**: Create a sequence that includes the unique colors of the border pixels detected.\n3.  **Determine Output Dimensions**: The dimensions depend of the number of different colors in the border sequence. If there are *n* colors, the output will be min(n, 5) x 5.\n4. **Construct the Output Grid.** Fill the grid with the colors from the border sequence obtained in step 2, repeating those colors as necessary to fill the grid.\n\n"
