Diagonal neighbors are not considered for border definition.\n2. **Extract Border Colors**: Create a sequence that includes the unique colors of the border pixels detected.\n3. **Determine Output Dimensions**: The dimensions depend of the number of different colors in the border sequence. If there are *n* colors, the output will be min(n, 5) x 5.\n4. **Construct the Output Grid.** Fill the grid with the colors from the border sequence obtained in step 2, repeating those colors as necessary to fill the grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_orthogonal_neighbors(grid, row, col):\n    \"\"\"Get the orthogonally adjacent neighbors of a cell.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n        new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc\n        if 0 <= new_row < rows and 0 <= new_col < cols:\n            neighbors.append(grid[new_row, new_col])\n    return neighbors\n\ndef find_border_pixels(grid):\n    \"\"\"Find pixels that have at least one orthogonally adjacent neighbor of a different color.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    border_pixels = []\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            neighbors = get_orthogonal_neighbors(grid, i, j)\n            if any(neighbor != grid[i, j] for neighbor in neighbors):\n                border_pixels.append((i, j))\n    return border_pixels\n\ndef extract_border_colors(grid, border_pixels):\n    \"\"\"Extract unique colors from the border pixels.\"\"\"\n    border_colors = []\n    for r, c in border_pixels:\n        color = grid[r,c]\n        if color not in border_colors:\n           border_colors.append(color)\n\n    return border_colors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid into a smaller output grid based on border colors.\"\"\"\n\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    border_pixels_coords = find_border_pixels(input_grid)\n    border_colors = extract_border_colors(input_grid, border_pixels_coords)\n\n    # Determine output grid dimensions.\n    output_rows = min(len(border_colors), 5)\n    output_cols = 5\n\n    # Construct the output grid.\n    output_grid = np.full((output_rows, output_cols), -1)  # Fill with -1 as a placeholder\n\n    # Fill with border colors, repeating as necessary.\n    \n    num_to_fill = output_rows*output_cols\n    \n    repeated_colors = (border_colors * (num_to_fill // len(border_colors) + 1))[:num_to_fill]\n    \n    output_grid = np.array(repeated_colors).reshape(output_rows, output_cols)\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
