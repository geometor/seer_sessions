task: grid_transformation
objects:
  - type: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 10x10
      - elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (2x5, 3x5, 5x5 in the examples)
      - elements: integers (0-9) representing colors, subset of input_grid elements
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    description: Input grid is transformed into a smaller output grid.
    details:
      - "The output grid is not a direct sub-grid of the input."
      - "Colors in the output grid are present in the input grid, but rearranged."
      - "Output dimensions are smaller and not directly proportional to the input."
      - "Changed areas are more likely to appear in the output"
actions:
  - type: identify_changing_colors
    description: "Locate colors that have changed positions, focusing on color changes, and their surrounding pixels."
  - type: construct_output
    description: "Build the output grid based on the identified changed positions."
