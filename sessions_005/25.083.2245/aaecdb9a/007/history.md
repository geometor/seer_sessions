1. **Identify Border Pixels:** Scan the input grid row by row, from left to right and top to bottom. A "border pixel" is a pixel that has at least one orthogonally adjacent neighbor (up, down, left, or right) with a different color. Diagonal neighbors are *not* considered.

2. **Extract Ordered Border Colors:** Create an *ordered* sequence, `border_colors`, of the *unique* colors of the border pixels, preserving the order in which they first appear during the scan.

3. **Determine Output Dimensions:**
   - The number of columns in the output grid is always 5.
   - The number of rows in the output grid is determined as follows:
       1. Let 'n' be the number of unique colors found in the `border_colors` sequence.
       2.  output_rows =  int(0.85*n + 0.5) if n > 4 else n-1 if n >=2 else n

4. **Construct Output Grid:**
    1. Create an output grid of the determined dimensions, filled initially with a placeholder value (e.g., -1).
    2. Fill the output grid with colors from the `border_colors` sequence. The precise placement logic is still under investigation, but it is based on `border_colors`.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of identifying border pixels and using their unique colors to construct the output grid has merit. However, the results show significant discrepancies between the expected and transformed outputs, especially in terms of pixel arrangement and, in the first example, output size. The core issue seems to be the logic used to *place* the border colors into the output grid. The current placeholder logic simply repeats the colors, which is incorrect. We need to refine the placement strategy to reflect the spatial relationships and patterns observed in the examples. The size calculation also needs adjusting in edge cases.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Size Calculation:** The current formula (`int(0.85 * num_colors + 0.5) if num_colors > 4 else num_colors - 1 if num_colors>=2 else num_colors`) works for some cases but fails in Example 1. We need to meticulously analyze the relationship between the number of unique border colors and the output dimensions across *all* examples to derive a universally correct formula (or set of rules).
2.  **Analyze Color Placement:** The heart of the problem.  We need to move beyond simple repetition and identify how the *position* of border pixels in the input grid influences the position of their colors in the output grid. We should look for patterns like:
    *   Does the order of appearance of border colors matter (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)?
    *   Are specific regions of the input grid mapped to specific regions of the output grid?
    *   Are there any geometric transformations (rotations, reflections) involved?
3.  **Iterative Refinement:**  After analyzing each example, we'll update the natural language program and the corresponding code.  We'll then re-test on *all* previous examples to ensure that the changes don't introduce regressions.

**Gather Metrics:**

Let's use code execution to get precise counts and relationships.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Border Pixels:** Scan the input grid to identify "border pixels." A border pixel is any pixel with at least one orthogonally adjacent neighbor (up, down, left, or right, but *not* diagonal) of a different color.

2.  **Extract Ordered Border Colors:** Create an ordered list, `border_colors`, of the *unique* colors of the border pixels. The order is determined by the first appearance of each border pixel during a top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan of the input grid.

3.  **Determine Output Dimensions:**
    *   The number of columns in the output grid is always 5.
    *   The number of rows is determined by the number of unique colors in `border_colors` (denoted as 'n'):
        *   If n > 4, output rows = int(0.85\*n + 0.5)
        *   If 2 <= n <= 4, output rows = n - 1.
        *   If n < 2, output rows = n.

4.  **Construct Output Grid:**

    1.  Create an output grid with the calculated dimensions, initially filled with a placeholder (e.g., -1).
    2. The colors and structure of the expected output depends on the order and spatial relationships between border colors in the original image. The top row of the output grid seems to correspond to a subset of the border colors.
    3. Fill the output grid row by row, where the sequence of unique border colors is used to construct the output grid.

5. **Refined Placement (Hypothesis):**
    It appears the output grid is built by taking rows of length 5 from the list of border colors. The colors in the output grid maintain the order in which they appear in the list of border colors. If there are not sufficient border colors, the list is cycled from the beginning.
