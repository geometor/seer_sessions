The core operation seems to be a transformation of the yellow objects. The output grids consistently have a smaller, more compact arrangement of yellow pixels compared to their corresponding inputs. The white pixels seem to act as background or empty space.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

All other pixels are set to white (0).\n\nEssentially, the transformation takes a yellow object of any shape and converts it into an expanding square centered on original shape's \"center\".\n"
