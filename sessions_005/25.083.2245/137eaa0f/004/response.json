            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to address the errors:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe errors indicate a problem with how the `numpy` array is being constructed. The message \"inhomogeneous shape\" means that the sublists being combined into the final array have different lengths. `numpy` arrays need to have consistent dimensions. The initial natural language program description, while conceptually correct (extracting non-zero values), didn't account for the varying number of non-zero elements in each row, which leads to this shape inconsistency. The strategy is to first understand the shape variability and then account for it. Simply put the program works *conceptually* but fails in *implementation*.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Inspect Input/Output Shapes:** Use code execution to print the shapes of the input and output grids for *all* examples. This will pinpoint exactly where the size discrepancies occur and how the output grid is structured. We want to see how the non-zero elements are arranged in the output.\n2.  **Analyze Row Lengths**: Determine if all rows must have the same number of non-zero values to form the output array. This seems to be the underlying issue.\n3.  **Re-evaluate the Natural Language Program:** The current description focuses on *extracting* non-zero values. We need to refine it to describe *how* these values are re-arranged into the output grid, taking into account any padding or reshaping required.\n4. **Hypothesis Generation:** Based on analysis, formulate a *revised* hypothesis. It must cover both the extraction of non-zeros and how the output shape is determined. A key question: Is the output a flattened representation of non-zero values, or does it maintain a 2D structure, and if so, on what basis?\n\n**Code Execution for Metrics:**\n\n"

This confirms that the provided output grids are also \"ragged\" (rows of unequal length), which is why `np.array()` cannot create a proper 2D array from them directly.\n\nWe can still deduce crucial information:\n\n*   **Input Shape:** Consistently (9, 9) across all examples.  This is *not* the source of the problem.\n*   **Output Shape:** *Cannot be directly represented as a standard NumPy array*. The output is *not* a simple flattening of the non-zero values. It retains a 2D structure, but the rows are of *variable* length.\n*  **Non-zero counts:** The number of non-zero elements varies significantly *between* rows, both in the input and the output.  However, within each example, the number of rows containing non-zero elements in the input is equal to the number of rows in the output. Also, rows that *are* all zeros in the input are skipped in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
