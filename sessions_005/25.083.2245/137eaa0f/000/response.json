The input grids contain many '0' values (white pixels), which seem to be background or empty space.  The non-zero values appear to be the focus. The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of the non-zero values from the input grid, maintaining a relative ordering, from top-left to bottom-right. There's a reduction in both dimensions and the zero values are discarded. Critically, the *order* and *relative positions* of non-zero, horizontally-adjacent pixels are somehow maintained.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
