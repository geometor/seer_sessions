Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, structured observations, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grids contain many '0' values (white pixels), which seem to be background or empty space.  The non-zero values appear to be the focus. The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of the non-zero values from the input grid, maintaining a relative ordering, from top-left to bottom-right. There's a reduction in both dimensions and the zero values are discarded. Critically, the *order* and *relative positions* of non-zero, horizontally-adjacent pixels are somehow maintained.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns), smaller than input_grid

  - name: non_zero_pixels
    type: set of cells
    properties:
      - value: integer (1-9)
      - position: (row, column) in input_grid

actions:
  - name: extract_non_zero
    description: Identify and collect all non-zero pixels from the input_grid.
  - name: condense
    description: Arrange the non-zero pixels into a smaller grid, preserving relative horizontal order within each original row.

relationships:
  - input_grid contains non_zero_pixels
  - output_grid is derived from non_zero_pixels
  - output_grid dimensions are smaller than input_grid dimensions.
  - Relative horizontal positions of non-zero pixels in a row of the input_grid are maintained in the output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Scan the input grid and identify all pixels with values other than 0.

2. **Row-wise Extraction and Ordering:** For each row in the input grid:
   - Extract the non-zero pixels *in the order they appear from left to right*.
   - Create an ordered list containing the non-zero values in the order that they appeared.

3. **Construct Output Grid:**
  - Create a new grid.
  - Going through our ordered lists created in step two from top to bottom:
    - For each ordered list that is not empty, add the values to a new row in the output grid.

In simpler terms: The program extracts all non-zero values from the input grid, row by row, preserving their original left-to-right order, and then arranges these extracted values into a new, smaller grid. The empty (zero-valued) cells are discarded.
