The same variable `input_grid` is used inside the while loops, I should update it so that it uses the `grid` parameter passed to the functions.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Fix the immediate error:** Modify the `find_length` function to accept the grid as an argument to resolve the `NameError`.\n2.  **Re-evaluate the logic:** After fixing the error, re-run the tests to evaluate outputs. I should then improve object detection (specifically of lines and crossings) to generalize.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (pre-fix):**\n\nSince the current code throws a `NameError`, I cannot yet compare the input and output grids. After fixing the immediate error, I will need to calculate metrics such as the:\n\n*   Number of vertical lines detected.\n*   Number of horizontal lines detected.\n*   Number of crossings detected.\n*   Presence and correctness of yellow fill.\n\n**YAML Fact Block (pre-fix - based on initial description):**\n\n"

A crossing occurs only where lines of *different* colors intersect.\n4.  **Fill Around Crossing:** For each crossing, change the color of the intersecting pixel and its immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors to yellow (color code 4).\n\nAfter fixing the Error, I will update this report with metrics from the test, and then a refined YAML fact block and updated natural language program.\n"
