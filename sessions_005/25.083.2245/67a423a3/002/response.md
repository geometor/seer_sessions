Okay, here's an analysis of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The primary issue is that the `find_length` function uses a global variable `input_grid` which hasn't been passed as an argument. The same variable `input_grid` is used inside the while loops, I should update it so that it uses the `grid` parameter passed to the functions.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Fix the immediate error:** Modify the `find_length` function to accept the grid as an argument to resolve the `NameError`.
2.  **Re-evaluate the logic:** After fixing the error, re-run the tests to evaluate outputs. I should then improve object detection (specifically of lines and crossings) to generalize.

**Metrics Gathering (pre-fix):**

Since the current code throws a `NameError`, I cannot yet compare the input and output grids. After fixing the immediate error, I will need to calculate metrics such as the:

*   Number of vertical lines detected.
*   Number of horizontal lines detected.
*   Number of crossings detected.
*   Presence and correctness of yellow fill.

**YAML Fact Block (pre-fix - based on initial description):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: vertical_line
    properties:
      - single_pixel_width: true
      - continuous: true
      - color: varies
  - object: horizontal_line
    properties:
      - single_pixel_width: true
      - continuous: true
      - color: varies
  - object: crossing
    properties:
      - intersection: vertical_line, horizontal_line
      - different_colors: true # vertical and horizontal lines have different colors
  - action: fill_around
    properties:
      - object: crossing
      - color: yellow
      - shape: cross-shape
      - extent: adjacent_cells
```


**Natural Language Program (revised, pre-fix):**

1.  **Identify Vertical Lines:** Find all contiguous, single-pixel-wide vertical lines of any non-background color.
2.  **Identify Horizontal Lines:** Find all contiguous, single-pixel-wide horizontal lines of any non-background color.
3.  **Find Crossings:** Determine the intersections (crossings) of vertical and horizontal lines. A crossing occurs only where lines of *different* colors intersect.
4.  **Fill Around Crossing:** For each crossing, change the color of the intersecting pixel and its immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors to yellow (color code 4).

After fixing the Error, I will update this report with metrics from the test, and then a refined YAML fact block and updated natural language program.
