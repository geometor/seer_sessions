  - object: intersection
    properties:
      - type: crossing of vertical and horizontal lines
      - description: The point where a vertical and a horizontal line of different colors meet.
  - object: fill
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - shape: cross-shaped, extending outwards
      - location: centered on intersection
      - description:  Yellow pixels surrounding the point of intersection and stopping one short of the intersecting lines.
  - action: find_lines
    description: Identify all vertical and horizontal lines in the input grid.
  - action: find_crossings
    description: Determine the locations where vertical and horizontal lines intersect.
  - action: fill_around_crossings
    description: Apply yellow fill around each intersection, extending outwards to fill the remaining spaces adjacent to the crossing, but not overwriting existing colors that formed the cross.
