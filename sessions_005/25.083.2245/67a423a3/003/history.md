Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation identifies vertical and horizontal lines within the input grid.
It locates where these lines intersect, forming a crossing.
A new color (yellow, represented by 4) appears in the output grid around this intersection.
The yellow color fills the cells immediately adjacent to the crossing point.
The fill extends horizontally from the intersection, stopping before the original lines.

## Example 3:
Error: name 'input_grid' is not defined
Okay, here's an analysis of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The primary issue is that the `find_length` function uses a global variable `input_grid` which hasn't been passed as an argument. The same variable `input_grid` is used inside the while loops, I should update it so that it uses the `grid` parameter passed to the functions.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Fix the immediate error:** Modify the `find_length` function to accept the grid as an argument to resolve the `NameError`.
2.  **Re-evaluate the logic:** After fixing the error, re-run the tests to evaluate outputs. I should then improve object detection (specifically of lines and crossings) to generalize.

**Metrics Gathering (pre-fix):**

Since the current code throws a `NameError`, I cannot yet compare the input and output grids. After fixing the immediate error, I will need to calculate metrics such as the:

*   Number of vertical lines detected.
*   Number of horizontal lines detected.
*   Number of crossings detected.
*   Presence and correctness of yellow fill.

**YAML Fact Block (pre-fix - based on initial description):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: vertical_line
    properties:
      - single_pixel_width: true
      - continuous: true
      - color: varies
  - object: horizontal_line
    properties:
      - single_pixel_width: true
      - continuous: true
      - color: varies
  - object: crossing
    properties:
      - intersection: vertical_line, horizontal_line
      - different_colors: true # vertical and horizontal lines have different colors
  - action: fill_around
    properties:
      - object: crossing
      - color: yellow
      - shape: cross-shape
      - extent: adjacent_cells
```


**Natural Language Program (revised, pre-fix):**

1.  **Identify Vertical Lines:** Find all contiguous, single-pixel-wide vertical lines of any non-background color.
2.  **Identify Horizontal Lines:** Find all contiguous, single-pixel-wide horizontal lines of any non-background color.
3.  **Find Crossings:** Determine the intersections (crossings) of vertical and horizontal lines. A crossing occurs only where lines of *different* colors intersect.
4.  **Fill Around Crossing:** For each crossing, change the color of the intersecting pixel and its immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors to yellow (color code 4).

After fixing the Error, I will update this report with metrics from the test, and then a refined YAML fact block and updated natural language program.
