Okay, let's analyze the provided information and formulate a plan to improve the natural language program and the subsequent code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a single example, which is insufficient to capture the full complexity of the transformation rule. The subsequent tests reveal significant discrepancies between the predicted and expected outputs in all three examples. The primary issue seems to be an incorrect understanding of how the "outlier" pixels (those not orange or azure) are rearranged. The current implementation shifts pixels down and to the right within a two-row window, and handles out-of-bounds by setting pixels to orange. This is clearly not consistent with all the examples. Instead of swapping or shifting, it seems pixels may fill spots, and there may be a specific ordering. The consistent element across examples *is* the preservation of the bottom azure row.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, focusing on *where* each non-orange/azure pixel from the input ends up in the output, not just *how* it moves. The current results indicate what the original program *thinks* will happen, now it is critical to know what *actually* happened.
2.  **Object Identification:** Identify "objects" (contiguous blocks of the same color) and track their transformations. Determine if object properties (size, shape, color) influence the transformation.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Based on the detailed analysis, revise the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation. Focus on precise wording and avoid ambiguous terms.
4.  **Iterative Improvement:** After revising the natural language program, expect the code to need adjustments.

**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code where needed):**

Let's analyze each example individually and collect metrics:


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output_grid):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output_grid = np.array(expected_output_grid)

    diff = input_grid != expected_output_grid
    pixels_off = np.sum(diff)
    print(f'{pixels_off=}')

    input_colors = {}
    output_colors = {}

    for i in range(10):
        input_colors[i] = np.sum(input_grid == i)
        output_colors[i] = np.sum(expected_output_grid == i)

    print(f'{input_colors=}')
    print(f'{output_colors=}')

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: background
    color: orange (7)
    property: static, fills most of the grid except the bottom row
  - object: base_row
    color: azure (8)
    property: static, bottom row, unchanged
  - object: outliers
    color: not orange (7) or azure (8)
    property: dynamic, rearranged within the area above the base row
  - observation: |
      Outlier pixels are rearranged to fill available spaces from top to bottom,
      and within each row from left to right.  The rearrangement occurs within the "central area"
      defined as all rows except for the bottom row. The order of the outliers
      in the output corresponds to their order in the input when read from top
      to bottom, and left to right.
  - action: rearrangement
    description: |
      Outlier pixels fill empty slots in the central area, maintaining their
      original relative order.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Central Area:** Determine the bounds of the transformation area. This is all rows except the last row, which is always completely azure (8).

2.  **Identify Outlier Pixels:** Within the central area, identify all pixels that are *not* orange (7) or azure (8). These are the "outlier" pixels.

3.  **Preserve Input Order**: Enumerate the outlier pixels, storing them temporarily in a list. Scan the input grid from top to bottom, and within each row from left to right.

4.  **Fill Output Grid**: Scan the *output* grid from top to bottom, and within each row, from left to right. Skip the last row (the azure row). Fill each empty cell (an empty cell is one that is currently orange (7)) with the next outlier from the list created in Step 3. If an encountered cell has a non-orange and non-azure color, skip it.

5.  **Preserve Base Row:** The last row of the output grid remains unchanged and should always be azure (8).
