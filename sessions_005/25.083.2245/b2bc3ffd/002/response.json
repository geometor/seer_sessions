            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and formulate a plan to improve the natural language program and the subsequent code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a single example, which is insufficient to capture the full complexity of the transformation rule. The subsequent tests reveal significant discrepancies between the predicted and expected outputs in all three examples. The primary issue seems to be an incorrect understanding of how the \"outlier\" pixels (those not orange or azure) are rearranged. The current implementation shifts pixels down and to the right within a two-row window, and handles out-of-bounds by setting pixels to orange. This is clearly not consistent with all the examples. Instead of swapping or shifting, it seems pixels may fill spots, and there may be a specific ordering. The consistent element across examples *is* the preservation of the bottom azure row.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, focusing on *where* each non-orange/azure pixel from the input ends up in the output, not just *how* it moves. The current results indicate what the original program *thinks* will happen, now it is critical to know what *actually* happened.\n2.  **Object Identification:** Identify \"objects\" (contiguous blocks of the same color) and track their transformations. Determine if object properties (size, shape, color) influence the transformation.\n3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Based on the detailed analysis, revise the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation. Focus on precise wording and avoid ambiguous terms.\n4.  **Iterative Improvement:** After revising the natural language program, expect the code to need adjustments.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code where needed):**\n\nLet's analyze each example individually and collect metrics:\n\n"
