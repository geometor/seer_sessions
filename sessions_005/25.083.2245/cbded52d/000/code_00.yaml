objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 8x8 (unchanging)
      - elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - value: integer (color)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: conditional_replacement
    conditions:
      - value_check: "pixel value is not 0 or 1"
      - position_check: "pixel is in an odd column (starting index 0)"
    transformation:
      - "If in an odd column and original value != 0 or 1, maintain original value."
      - "If in an even column, and original value != 0 or 1, if there is another pixel with same value, same row, and odd column index, then maintain original value, else, change the color."
relationships:
  - spatial: pixels are arranged in a 2D grid.
  - conditional: pixel values are conditionally modified based on value, column, and a limited row search for matching values.
