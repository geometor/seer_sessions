The transformation seems to operate on specific, isolated pixels within the grid, primarily focusing on pixels that are *not* 0 or 1. It looks like a very localized, conditional replacement based on the original value and x position. The overall structure and dimensions of the grid remain unchanged. Large areas of 0s also appear important.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
