       If a non 0 or 1 pixel exists at an *odd index*, it remains unchanged.
       If a non 0 or 1 pixel exists at an *even index*, and there is the same value in the same row at an odd index, then the pixel at the even index is kept unchanged.
       If a non 0 or 1 pixel exists at an *even index*, and there is no same value in the same row at an odd index, then pixel's value is changed to 1.
