facts:
  - observation: "The grids consist of digits 0-9, representing colors."
  - observation: "0 and 1 values are generally preserved."
  - observation: "Values other than 0 and 1 in even columns are conditionally changed."
  - condition: "Change depends on the existence of the same value in an odd column in the same row."
  - action_if_true: "If a matching value exists in an odd column, the original value is preserved."
  - action_if_false: "If no matching value, previous implementation choose the first candidate in the row, but it's not the correctly one."
  - objects:
      - name: "pixel"
        properties:
          - value: "integer (0-9)"
          - row_index: "integer"
          - column_index: "integer"
          - parity: "even or odd (based on column index)"
      - name: "row"
        properties:
          - index: "integer"
  - transformation_rule: "Conditional change of pixel values based on row, column, and matching values within the row."
