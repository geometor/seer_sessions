```python
import numpy as np

"""
Identify the control pixel at grid position (0, 0).
Based on the color of the control pixel, perform a shift operation on the rest of the grid content.
Pixels shifted outside the grid boundaries are discarded.
Areas vacated by the shift are filled with the background color (white, 0).
The control pixel itself remains unchanged in the output grid at position (0, 0).

Control Logic Mapping:
- Color 9 (maroon): No shift. Content remains in place.
- Color 4 (yellow): Shift content down by 3 rows.
- Color 6 (magenta): Shift content right by 5 columns.
- Color 7 (orange): Shift content left by 4 columns.
