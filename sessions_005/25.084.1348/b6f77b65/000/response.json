The direction and magnitude of the shift depend on the color of the control pixel.\n    *   Pixels shifted outside the grid boundaries are discarded.\n    *   Areas vacated by the shift are filled with the background color (white, 0).\n    *   The control pixel itself remains unchanged in the output grid at position (0, 0).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
