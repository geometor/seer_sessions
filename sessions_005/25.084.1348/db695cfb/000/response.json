Within these grids, there are blue (1) pixels and sometimes magenta (6) pixels. The transformation involves the blue pixels moving and leaving trails. The magenta pixels appear to act as obstacles or stopping points for the blue pixels' movement. The background color remains unchanged in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
