Task: Trace paths of blue pixels until stopped by magenta pixels or grid boundaries.

Elements:
  - Object: Grid
    Properties:
      - width: Integer
      - height: Integer
      - background_color: Integer (e.g., 5, 8, 4) - remains constant
  - Object: Blue Pixel
    Identifier: Color value 1
    Properties:
      - position: (row, column)
    Actions:
      - Initiates a path starting from its input position.
      - Moves iteratively one step diagonally down and to the right (row+1, col+1).
      - Leaves a trail of blue pixels along its path.
  - Object: Magenta Pixel
    Identifier: Color value 6
    Properties:
      - position: (row, column)
    Role:
      - Acts as an obstacle/stopper for the blue pixel's path.
      - Remains unchanged in the output grid.
  - Object: Path Segment
    Identifier: Color value 1 (in the output grid)
    Properties:
      - position: (row, column)
    Formation:
      - Created at each position visited by a blue pixel during its movement, including the starting position.

Relationships & Rules:
  - For each blue pixel in the input grid:
    - Start tracing a path from its initial position.
    - In each step, determine the next potential position: (current_row + 1, current_col + 1).
    - Check the condition at the next potential position:
      - If the next position is outside the grid boundaries: Stop tracing.
      - If the pixel at the next position in the *input* grid is magenta (6): Stop tracing.
      - Otherwise: Mark the current position as blue (1) in the output grid and continue tracing from the next position.
  - The final output grid contains:
    - The original background color in cells not part of any path and not originally magenta.
    - Blue (1) pixels marking the traced paths (including starting points).
    - The original magenta (6) pixels at their input positions.
