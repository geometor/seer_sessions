Identify the locations of all blue (1) pixels in the input grid.\n3. For each identified blue pixel location (start_row, start_col):\n    a. Set the current position (current_row, current_col) to the starting location.\n    b. Enter a loop to trace the path:\n        i. Mark the pixel at (current_row, current_col) in the *output* grid as blue (1).\n        ii. Calculate the next potential position: (next_row = current_row + 1, next_col = current_col + 1).\n        iii. Check boundary conditions: If next_row is outside the grid height or next_col is outside the grid width, exit the loop for this blue pixel's path.\n        iv. Check obstacle condition: Look up the color of the pixel at (next_row, next_col) in the *original input* grid. If this color is magenta (6), exit the loop for this blue pixel's path.\n        v. If neither boundary nor obstacle condition is met, update the current position: current_row = next_row, current_col = next_col, and continue the loop from step (b.i).\n4.
