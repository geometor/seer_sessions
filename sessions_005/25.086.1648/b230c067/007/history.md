Transforms an input grid containing white (0) and azure (8) pixels into an output grid of the same dimensions.

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white (0).
2.  Identify all distinct connected objects composed of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. Use 8-way connectivity (including diagonals). If no azure objects are found, return the initial white output grid.
3.  For each identified azure object, determine its properties:
    *   The set of pixel coordinates `(row, col)` belonging to the object.
    *   The bounding box containing the object: `(min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)`.
    *   Whether the object contains an internal "hole" (a contiguous area of white pixels fully enclosed by the object and not connected to the grid exterior relative to the object's boundary).
4.  Count the total number of azure objects that possess a hole (`hole_count`).
5.  Determine which objects (if any) will be colored red (2) and blue (1) based on `hole_count`:
    *   **If `hole_count` is exactly 1:**
        *   Designate the single object *with* the hole to be colored blue (1).
        *   Among the objects *without* holes, identify the "top-right-most" one. Designate this object to be colored red (2). (The "top-right-most" object is the one with the minimum `min_row`; if there's a tie, it's the one among the tied objects with the maximum `max_col`).
        *   Designate all *other* objects (those without holes that were not chosen to be red) to be colored blue (1).
    *   **If `hole_count` is 0:**
        *   Among *all* azure objects, identify the "top-right-most" one (using the same definition as above). Designate this object to be colored red (2).
        *   Designate all *other* azure objects to be colored blue (1).
    *   **If `hole_count` is greater than 1:**
        *   No objects are designated to be colored red or blue. The output grid remains white.
6.  Populate the output grid: For every pixel `(r, c)` belonging to an object designated red, set `output_grid[r, c]` to 2. For every pixel `(r, c)` belonging to an object designated blue, set `output_grid[r, c]` to 1.
7.  Return the final output grid.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The primary reason for the errors ("Error: scipy.ndimage is required but not available.") across all examples is an external dependency issue. The Python code relies on the `scipy` library, specifically `scipy.ndimage`, for crucial functions like finding connected components (`ndimage.label`) which are used to identify the azure objects and detect holes. This library was not present in the execution environment.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Dependency Management:** The coder phase must address this. Options include:
    *   Ensuring `scipy` is available in the execution environment.
    *   Re-implementing the necessary functionalities (connected components using 8-way connectivity, hole detection logic) using only standard Python libraries and `numpy`. This is often preferred in ARC contexts to minimize external dependencies.
2.  **Logic Verification:** Despite the execution failure, the *intended logic* described in the code's docstring and structure needs to be re-evaluated against all training examples (assuming they become available or can be visualized). The core logic involves:
    *   Identifying azure (8) objects (connected components).
    *   Checking each object for internal holes (regions of white (0) fully enclosed by the object).
    *   Counting the number of objects with holes (`hole_count`).
    *   Applying coloring rules based on `hole_count` (0, 1, or >1) and object position (top-right-most).

**Gathering Metrics**

Assuming a working implementation of connected components and hole detection (either via `scipy` or a reimplementation), the following metrics would be gathered for each training example:

1.  **Input Grid Dimensions:** `height`, `width`
2.  **Azure Objects:**
    *   Count of distinct azure (8) objects.
    *   For each object:
        *   Set of pixel coordinates `{(r, c), ...}`.
        *   Bounding Box: `(min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)`.
        *   Hole Status: `True` or `False`.
3.  **Hole Count:** Total number of azure objects with `Hole Status == True`.
4.  **Object Selection (if applicable):**
    *   Identify the "top-right-most" object based on minimum `min_row`, then maximum `max_col`.
    *   Identify the object with a hole (if `hole_count == 1`).
5.  **Output Grid:** Compare the generated output grid pixel-by-pixel with the expected output grid to verify correctness.

*Self-Correction/Refinement during Metric Gathering:* If the output generated by the assumed logic does not match the example output, the interpretation of "hole", "connected component", "top-right-most", or the coloring rules themselves would need refinement by re-observing the differences in the specific example.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with white (0).
2.  Identify all distinct connected objects formed by contiguous azure (8) pixels in the input grid, using 8-way connectivity (including diagonals). If no azure objects are found, return the initial white output grid.
3.  For each identified azure object, determine if it contains an internal "hole". A hole is defined as one or more white (0) pixels completely surrounded by the object's azure pixels.
4.  Count the total number of azure objects that contain at least one hole (`hole_count`).
5.  Apply coloring rules based on `hole_count`:
    *   **If `hole_count` is exactly 1:**
        *   The single object *with* the hole is designated to be colored blue (1).
        *   Among the objects *without* holes, identify the "top-right-most" object. This object is designated to be colored red (2). (The "top-right-most" object is the one whose bounding box starts at the minimum row index; if there's a tie in minimum row index, it's the one among the tied objects whose bounding box ends at the maximum column index).
        *   All other objects (those without holes that were not designated red) are designated to be colored blue (1). If there are no objects without holes, only the object with the hole is colored blue.
    *   **If `hole_count` is 0:**
        *   Among *all* azure objects, identify the "top-right-most" object (using the same definition as above). This object is designated to be colored red (2).
        *   All other azure objects are designated to be colored blue (1). If there is only one object, it is colored red.
    *   **If `hole_count` is greater than 1:**
        *   No objects are designated to be colored red or blue. Proceed to step 7.
6.  Populate the output grid: For every pixel `(row, col)` belonging to an object designated red, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to red (2). For every pixel `(row, col)` belonging to an object designated blue, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to blue (1). (If a pixel were designated both red and blue, red takes precedence, though this shouldn't occur with this logic).
7.  Return the final output grid.
