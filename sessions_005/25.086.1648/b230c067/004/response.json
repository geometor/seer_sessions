            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and plan the next steps.\n\n**1. General Assessment**\n\nThe primary issue reported is a `NameError: name 'label' is not defined` occurring during the execution of the `find_connected_components` function on all training examples. This error prevents the function from executing successfully, meaning the core logic of identifying objects, detecting holes, and applying coloring rules was never actually tested against the examples.\n\nThe error strongly suggests that the `label` function from `scipy.ndimage` was called without the necessary prefix (e.g., `ndimage.label` or `scipy.ndimage.label`), despite the `import` statement. The `try...except ImportError` block might be misleading if `scipy` *is* installed but the functions are simply called incorrectly within the `try` block.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Error Correction:** The immediate step is to correct the function calls within `find_connected_components` and potentially `has_hole` to use the appropriate prefix (assuming `scipy.ndimage` is imported, perhaps as `ndimage`). For instance, `label(...)` should likely be `ndimage.label(...)` and `find_objects(...)` should be `ndimage.find_objects(...)`.\n2.  **Verification:** Once the technical error is resolved, the code needs to be re-run on the training examples.\n3.  **Logic Validation:** The output from the corrected code must be compared against the expected output for each training example. This will validate whether the core logic (object identification, hole detection, coloring rules based on hole count and position) accurately reflects the task's requirements.\n4.  **Refinement:** If discrepancies exist between the code's output and the expected output, the observations and the natural language program need to be updated to reflect the true transformation rules derived from the examples.\n\n**2. Gather Metrics**\n\n*Unable to gather metrics directly as the code failed to execute and the specific task examples (input/output grids) were not provided in this request.*\n\nIf the examples were available and the code executable, I would gather the following:\n\n"

It also implicitly assumes the `NameError` will be fixed.*\n\n1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white (0).\n2.  Identify all distinct connected objects composed of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. Use 8-way connectivity (including diagonals). If no azure objects are found, return the initial white output grid.\n3.  For each identified azure object, determine its properties:\n    *   The set of pixel coordinates `(row, col)` belonging to the object.\n    *   The bounding box containing the object: `(min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)`.\n    *   Whether the object contains an internal \"hole\" (a contiguous area of white pixels fully enclosed by the object and not connected to the grid exterior relative to the object's boundary).\n4.  Count the total number of azure objects that possess a hole (`hole_count`).\n5.  Determine which objects (if any) will be colored red (2) and blue (1) based on `hole_count`:\n    *   **If `hole_count` is exactly 1:**\n        *   Designate the single object *with* the hole to be colored blue (1).\n        *   Among the objects *without* holes, identify the \"top-right-most\" one. Designate this object to be colored red (2). (The \"top-right-most\" object is the one with the minimum `min_row`; if there's a tie, it's the one among the tied objects with the maximum `max_col`).\n        *   Designate all *other* objects (those without holes that were not chosen to be red) to be colored blue (1).\n    *   **If `hole_count` is 0:**\n        *   Among *all* azure objects, identify the \"top-right-most\" one (using the same definition as above). Designate this object to be colored red (2).\n        *   Designate all *other* azure objects to be colored blue (1).\n    *   **If `hole_count` is greater than 1:**\n        *   No objects are designated to be colored red or blue. The output grid remains white.\n6.  Populate the output grid: For every pixel `(r, c)` belonging to an object designated red, set `output_grid[r, c]` to 2. For every pixel `(r, c)` belonging to an object designated blue, set `output_grid[r, c]` to 1.\n7.  Return the final output grid."
