"""
Transforms an input grid containing white (0) and azure (8) pixels into an output grid of the same dimensions.

1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with white (0) pixels.
2.  Identify all distinct connected groups (objects) of azure (8) pixels in the input grid, using 8-directional connectivity (including diagonals). If no azure objects are found, return the initialized white grid.
3.  For each identified azure object:
    a.  Determine its bounding box (minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, maximum column).
    b.  Determine if the object contains a "hole". A hole exists if there is an area of one or more connected white (0) pixels fully enclosed within the object, such that this white area is not connected to the region outside the object's bounding box (considering a 1-pixel padded boundary).
4.  Count the total number of azure objects that have a hole (`hole_count`).
5.  Determine which objects will be colored red (2) and blue (1) based on `hole_count`:
    a.  If `hole_count` is exactly 1:
        i.  The single object possessing the hole is designated to be colored blue (1).
        ii. Among the objects *without* holes, find the "top-right-most" one. This object is designated to be colored red (2). ("Top-right-most" means the object whose bounding box has the minimum top row index; if there's a tie, choose the one among them whose bounding box has the maximum right column index).
        iii. All other objects (those without holes that were not selected to be red) are designated to be colored blue (1).
    b.  If `hole_count` is 0:
        i.  Among *all* azure objects, find the "top-right-most" one using the same definition as above (minimum top row index, maximum right column index tie-breaker). This object is designated to be colored red (2).
        ii. All other azure objects are designated to be colored blue (1).
    c.  If `hole_count` is greater than 1: No objects are designated red or blue. The output grid remains white.
6.  Populate the output grid: For every pixel location `(r, c)` that belongs to an object designated red, set `output_grid[r, c]` to 2. For every pixel location `(r, c)` that belongs to an object designated blue, set `output_grid[r, c]` to 1.
7.  Return the final output grid.
