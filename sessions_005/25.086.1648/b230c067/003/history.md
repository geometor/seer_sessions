"""
This module transforms an input grid containing white (0) and azure (8) pixels
into an output grid of the same dimensions. The transformation involves identifying
distinct azure objects, analyzing their properties (specifically, whether they enclose
a "hole" of white pixels and their top-right position), and recoloring them
either blue (1) or red (2) based on specific rules.

The rules are:
1. Identify all connected components (objects) of azure (8) pixels.
2. For each object, determine its bounding box and if it contains a hole (enclosed white area).
3. Count the number of objects with holes.
4. If exactly one object has a hole:
    - This object with the hole is colored blue (1).
    - Among the objects *without* holes, find the "top-right-most" one (minimum row index of the bounding box top edge, breaking ties with maximum column index of the bounding box right edge). This object is colored red (2).
    - All other objects (without holes, not selected as red) are colored blue (1).
5. If zero objects have holes:
    - Among *all* objects, find the "top-right-most" one (minimum row index, maximum column index tie-breaker). This object is colored red (2).
    - All other objects are colored blue (1).
6. The background white (0) pixels remain unchanged.

Train Set Error: error:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided Python code attempts to solve the task by identifying azure objects, detecting if they enclose white "holes", and then recoloring them blue or red based on the number of objects with holes and their relative positions.

The immediate error (`No module named 'scipy'`) prevents execution and validation. This is an environment issue; the `scipy` library, crucial for `label`, `find_objects`, and potentially `binary_erosion`, is not available.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Assume Code Logic is Correct (for now):** Since execution failed due to external factors, we will proceed by analyzing the *intended* logic described in the code's docstring and implementation. We assume this logic was derived correctly from at least the first training example.
2.  **Re-evaluate Logic Against (Assumed) Examples:** Review the logic's components: object identification, hole detection, positional selection (top-right-most), and conditional coloring rules. Consider if this logic seems plausible and generalizable across different ARC tasks or if it might be overfitting to specific features of the initial example(s).
3.  **Refine Descriptions:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the detailed steps and definitions used in the code (e.g., the precise definition of "hole" and "top-right-most").
4.  **Address Environment Issue (Implicit):** Note that for future execution, the environment needs `numpy` and `scipy`.

**Gathered Metrics (Based on Code Logic)**

The code aims to compute the following metrics for each input grid to determine the transformation:

1.  **Input Grid Dimensions:** `height`, `width`.
2.  **Azure Objects:**
    *   List of distinct connected components (pixels belonging to each object). Connectivity is 8-directional (includes diagonals).
    *   Total count of azure objects.
3.  **Object Properties:** For each azure object:
    *   Set of pixel coordinates `(row, col)`.
    *   Bounding Box: `min_row`, `min_col`, `max_row`, `max_col`.
    *   `has_hole`: Boolean flag indicating if the object encloses a contiguous area of white (0) pixels that is not connected to the grid border *relative to the object's bounding box*.
4.  **Aggregate Properties:**
    *   `hole_count`: Total number of azure objects where `has_hole` is True.
5.  **Selection Criteria:**
    *   "Top-right-most" object identification: Based on minimum `min_row` (top edge of bounding box), breaking ties with maximum `max_col` (right edge of bounding box).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with white (0) pixels.
2.  Identify all distinct connected groups (objects) of azure (8) pixels in the input grid, using 8-directional connectivity (including diagonals). If no azure objects are found, return the initialized white grid.
3.  For each identified azure object:
    a.  Determine its bounding box (minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, maximum column).
    b.  Determine if the object contains a "hole". A hole exists if there is an area of one or more connected white (0) pixels fully enclosed within the object, such that this white area is not connected to the region outside the object's bounding box (considering a 1-pixel padded boundary).
4.  Count the total number of azure objects that have a hole (`hole_count`).
5.  Determine which objects will be colored red (2) and blue (1) based on `hole_count`:
    a.  **If `hole_count` is exactly 1:**
        i.  The single object possessing the hole is designated to be colored blue (1).
        ii. Among the objects *without* holes, find the "top-right-most" one. This object is designated to be colored red (2). ("Top-right-most" means the object whose bounding box has the minimum top row index; if there's a tie, choose the one among them whose bounding box has the maximum right column index).
        iii. All other objects (those without holes that were not selected to be red) are designated to be colored blue (1).
    b.  **If `hole_count` is 0:**
        i.  Among *all* azure objects, find the "top-right-most" one using the same definition as above (minimum top row index, maximum right column index tie-breaker). This object is designated to be colored red (2).
        ii. All other azure objects are designated to be colored blue (1).
    c.  **If `hole_count` is greater than 1:** (Based on current code logic, though not explicitly covered by presumed examples) No objects are designated red or blue. The output grid remains white.
6.  Populate the output grid: For every pixel location `(r, c)` that belongs to an object designated red, set `output_grid[r, c]` to 2. For every pixel location `(r, c)` that belongs to an object designated blue, set `output_grid[r, c]` to 1.
7.  Return the final output grid.
