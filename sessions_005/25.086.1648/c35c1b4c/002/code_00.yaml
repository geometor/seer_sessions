task_context: Identify and fill enclosed regions based on the most frequent color.
grid_properties:
  - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - Grids contain multiple colors (represented by integers 0-9).
objects:
  - Dominant Color Pixel: The pixel value that appears most frequently in the input grid. Acts as a boundary or 'wall'.
  - Non-Dominant Color Pixel: Any pixel value other than the dominant color.
  - Enclosed Region: A contiguous area (orthogonal and diagonal connections) of non-dominant color pixels that cannot reach the grid boundary without crossing a dominant color pixel.
  - Boundary Pixel: A pixel located on the top, bottom, left, or right edge of the grid.
actions:
  - Identify Dominant Color: Count the frequency of each color in the input grid and determine the most frequent one. If there's a tie, the behavior is undefined by the examples but seems to pick one consistently (likely lowest index or first encountered maximum).
  - Identify Reachable Pixels: Perform a search (e.g., BFS) starting from all non-dominant boundary pixels. The search can traverse through any non-dominant pixel (orthogonally or diagonally). Mark all pixels visited during this search as 'reachable'.
  - Fill Enclosed Regions: Iterate through the input grid. For every pixel that is not the dominant color and was not marked as 'reachable', change its color to the dominant color in the output grid.
  - Copy Unchanged Pixels: All dominant color pixels and all 'reachable' non-dominant color pixels retain their original color in the output grid.
output_grid_generation:
  - Create a copy of the input grid.
  - Modify the copy by filling the identified enclosed regions with the dominant color.
