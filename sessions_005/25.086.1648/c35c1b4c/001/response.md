"""
Identify the color with the highest frequency in the input grid (dominant_color).
Create a copy of the input grid.
Identify all pixels that are not the dominant_color and are located on the grid boundary.
Perform a search (like BFS) starting from these boundary non-dominant_color pixels, marking all reachable non-dominant_color pixels via orthogonal and diagonal moves through other non-dominant_color pixels.
Iterate through the copied grid. Any pixel that is not the dominant_color and was not marked as reachable should be changed to the dominant_color.
Return the modified grid.
