They are not reachable from the edge without crossing red (2). They all change to red (2) in the output.\n\n**Hypothesis Refinement:**\n1. Identify the color that appears most frequently in the input grid. Let this be the \"dominant color\".\n2. Identify all pixels that do *not* have the dominant color.\n3. For each non-dominant pixel, check if it can reach the border of the grid by only moving orthogonally or diagonally through other non-dominant colored pixels.\n4. If a non-dominant pixel *cannot* reach the border without passing through a pixel of the dominant color, change its color to the dominant color.\n5. All other pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**Edge Cases/Considerations:**\n- What if there's a tie for the most frequent color? The examples don't show this. Assume the task guarantees a unique most frequent color, or perhaps the first one encountered in some order (e.g., lowest numerical value) wins. Based on the examples, a unique maximum seems likely.\n- What if the entire grid is one color? No changes would occur.\n- What if the most frequent color doesn't form a single connected region? The \"reachability\" check still works. A non-dominant pixel is enclosed if *all* paths to the border eventually hit the dominant color.\n\nLet's re-verify train_1 with the reachability concept.\n- The white block (4,5)-(7,7) and the maroon pixels within it: Any path from these pixels outwards eventually hits the green border surrounding them. They cannot reach the grid edge without crossing green. So they turn green.\n- Other non-green pixels (maroon, orange, white): They are either on the edge or have clear paths to the edge consisting only of non-green pixels. They remain unchanged.\n\nSeems robust.\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Count pixel color frequencies.\n2. Determine the dominant color (highest frequency).\n3. Create a copy of the input grid.\n4. Perform a flood fill or similar search (like Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) starting from all non-dominant pixels located on the grid border.\n5. Mark all reachable non-dominant pixels during this search.\n6. Iterate through the grid. Any pixel that is *not* the dominant color and was *not* marked as reachable should be changed to the dominant color in the copied grid.\n7. Return the modified grid.## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with integer values representing colors.\n2.  **Colors:** Multiple colors are present in each grid (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of certain pixels within the grid. The output grid retains the overall structure and most pixel colors from the input, with specific regions being altered.\n4.  **Dominant Color:** In each example, one color appears more frequently than others in the input grid (train_1: green(3), train_2: blue(1), train_3: red(2)). This color seems central to the transformation.\n5.  **Enclosed Regions:** The pixels that change color in the output are consistently those that are *not* of the dominant color but are located *inside* regions primarily composed of the dominant color. They appear to be \"holes\" or enclosed areas within the dominant color mass.\n6.  **Filling Mechanism:** These enclosed, non-dominant pixels are \"filled\" with the dominant color in the output grid.\n7.  **Connectivity:** The concept of enclosure seems related to connectivity. Pixels that can reach the grid's boundary without passing through the dominant color remain unchanged. Pixels that cannot reach the boundary without crossing the dominant color are changed. Reachability includes orthogonal and diagonal neighbors.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
