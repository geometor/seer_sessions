task_type: object_transformation # Filling enclosed regions based on color frequency.

components:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (10x10 in examples)
      - pixel_colors: integers 0-9

transformation:
  - type: identification
    description: Identify the color with the highest frequency in the input grid. Call this the 'dominant_color'.
  - type: segmentation
    description: Conceptually segment the grid into 'dominant_color' pixels and 'other_color' pixels.
  - type: analysis
    target: other_color pixels
    method: reachability_analysis
    parameters:
      - boundary: grid edges
      - traversal_allowed_through: other_color pixels only (orthogonal and diagonal steps)
    output: identify 'other_color' pixels that cannot reach the grid boundary without crossing a 'dominant_color' pixel. Call these 'enclosed_pixels'.
  - type: modification
    target: enclosed_pixels
    action: change_color
    parameters:
      - new_color: dominant_color
  - type: preservation
    target: all other pixels (dominant_color pixels and non-enclosed other_color pixels)
    action: keep_original_color

relationships:
  - dominant_color is determined by the highest pixel count.
  - enclosed_pixels are defined by their spatial relationship to the dominant_color pixels and the grid boundary.
  - The final output is the input grid modified only by changing the color of enclosed_pixels to the dominant_color.

constraints:
  - Assume a unique dominant color exists based on frequency count.
