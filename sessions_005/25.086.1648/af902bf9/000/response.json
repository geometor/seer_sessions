White acts as the background.\n    *   In the input grids, there are sets of four yellow pixels arranged at the corners of rectangles.\n    *   The output grids retain the original yellow pixels from the input.\n    *   Additionally, the output grids contain red pixels that fill the rectangular area strictly *inside* the boundaries defined by each set of four yellow corner pixels.\n    *   If the area inside a rectangle defined by yellow corners is empty (i.e., the corners are adjacent either horizontally or vertically), no red pixels are added for that rectangle.\n    *   There can be multiple, non-overlapping sets of yellow corners and corresponding red filled areas within a single grid.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
