task_description: Transforms a grid by removing gray pixels and drawing a diagonal line based on the relative positions of the top-leftmost gray and main color pixels.

definitions:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
  - name: white
    value: 0
  - name: gray
    value: 5
  - name: main_color
    description: The single color in the input grid that is not white (0) or gray (5). Let this color be C.
  - name: top_leftmost_gray
    description: The gray pixel (5) with the minimum row index, and minimum column index among those in the minimum row. Let its coordinates be (gr, gc).
  - name: top_leftmost_main
    description: The main color pixel (C) with the minimum row index, and minimum column index among those in the minimum row. Let its coordinates be (mr, mc).
  - name: start_point
    description: The coordinates (sr, sc) from which the new diagonal line begins.
  - name: diagonal_line
    description: A line of pixels starting at (sr, sc) and extending downwards and to the right (incrementing row and column by 1) until the grid boundary is reached.

transformation_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: 2
    action: Identify the main_color (C) in the input grid.
  - step: 3
    action: Find the coordinates (gr, gc) of the top_leftmost_gray pixel.
  - step: 4
    action: Find the coordinates (mr, mc) of the top_leftmost_main pixel.
  - step: 5
    action: Change all gray (5) pixels in the output grid to white (0).
  - step: 6
    action: Determine the start_point (sr, sc) for the diagonal_line based on (gr, gc) and (mr, mc).
    logic:
      - if gc > mc:
          sr = 0
          sc = gc
      - else (if gc <= mc):
          sr = gr
          sc = 0
  - step: 7
    action: Draw the diagonal_line on the output grid using the main_color (C), starting from (sr, sc). Overwrite existing pixel values.

assumptions:
  - There is exactly one main_color (non-white, non-gray) in the input.
  - There is at least one gray pixel in the input.
  - There is at least one main_color pixel in the input.
