task_description: Replace gray pixels with white, then draw a new diagonal line based on the locations of the original top-leftmost gray and main color pixels.

definitions:
  - name: main_color
    description: The single color pixel value in the input grid that is not white (0) or gray (5).
  - name: gray_pixel
    description: A pixel with the value 5.
  - name: white_pixel
    description: A pixel with the value 0.
  - name: top_leftmost_gray
    property: coordinates (gr, gc)
    description: The gray pixel with the minimum row index, and then the minimum column index among those in the minimum row.
  - name: top_leftmost_main
    property: coordinates (mr, mc)
    description: The main_color pixel with the minimum row index, and then the minimum column index among those in the minimum row.
  - name: diagonal_line
    property: color (main_color), direction (down-right), start_point (sr, sc)
    description: A line of pixels where each subsequent pixel is one row down and one column right from the previous one.

transformation_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: 2
    action: Identify the main_color (C) in the input grid.
  - step: 3
    action: Locate the coordinates (gr, gc) of the top_leftmost_gray pixel.
  - step: 4
    action: Locate the coordinates (mr, mc) of the top_leftmost_main pixel.
  - step: 5
    action: In the output grid, change all gray_pixels (5) to white_pixels (0).
  - step: 6
    action: Determine the starting coordinates (sr, sc) for the diagonal_line.
    logic:
      - condition: If mr equals mc (mr == mc)
        result: sr = 0, sc = gc
      - condition: If mr does not equal mc (mr != mc)
        result: sr = gr, sc = 0
  - step: 7
    action: Draw the diagonal_line starting from (sr, sc) using the main_color (C).
    details: The line extends downwards and to the right (r+1, c+1) until it goes off the grid boundaries. Pixels on this line overwrite existing pixels in the output grid.
  - step: 8
    action: Return the modified output grid.

constraints:
  - Assumes exactly one main_color exists besides white and gray.
  - Assumes at least one gray pixel and one main_color pixel exist for the line drawing logic to apply fully (though gray removal happens regardless).
