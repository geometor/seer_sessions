            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the task.\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the main color and the removal of gray pixels in all examples. It also correctly identified the need to draw a diagonal line using the main color. The code worked perfectly for Examples 1 and 2, but failed for Example 3. The discrepancy lies specifically in determining the starting coordinates `(sr, sc)` for the new diagonal line. The original logic (`if gc > mc, start = (0, gc) else start = (gr, 0)`) was insufficient. By analyzing the input coordinates of the top-leftmost gray pixel `(gr, gc)` and the top-leftmost main color pixel `(mr, mc)` against the required starting point in the output for all three examples, a revised rule for the starting point has been identified. This revised rule needs to be incorporated into the natural language program.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's gather coordinates and check the proposed rule for the starting point: `If mr == mc, start = (0, gc), else start = (gr, 0)`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 10x10\n*   Main Color (C): 9 (maroon)\n*   Top-leftmost Gray `(gr, gc)`: (1, 5)\n*   Top-leftmost Main `(mr, mc)`: (0, 5)\n*   Output Diagonal Start: (1, 0)\n*   Rule Check: `mr = 0`, `mc = 5`. `mr != mc`. Rule predicts `(gr, 0) = (1, 0)`. Matches output.\n*   Code Result: Match.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 10x10\n*   Main Color (C): 7 (orange)\n*   Top-leftmost Gray `(gr, gc)`: (3, 4)\n*   Top-leftmost Main `(mr, mc)`: (0, 0)\n*   Output Diagonal Start: (0, 4)\n*   Rule Check: `mr = 0`, `mc = 0`. `mr == mc`. Rule predicts `(0, gc) = (0, 4)`. Matches output.\n*   Code Result: Match.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 10x10\n*   Main Color (C): 2 (red)\n*   Top-leftmost Gray `(gr, gc)`: (3, 3)\n*   Top-leftmost Main `(mr, mc)`: (1, 0)\n*   Output Diagonal Start: (3, 0)\n*   Rule Check: `mr = 1`, `mc = 0`. `mr != mc`. Rule predicts `(gr, 0) = (3, 0)`. Matches output.\n*   Code Result: Mismatch. The code used the old rule (`gc > mc` -> `(0, gc)`), predicting `(0, 3)` incorrectly.\n\nThe analysis confirms the revised rule `If mr == mc, start = (0, gc), else start = (gr, 0)` correctly predicts the starting point for the diagonal line in all three examples.\n\n## YAML Fact Sheet\n\n"
