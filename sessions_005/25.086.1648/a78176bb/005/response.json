Identify the single \"main color\" (C), which is the color present in the input grid other than white (0) and gray (5).\n3. Locate the coordinates (gr, gc) of the top-leftmost gray (5) pixel (minimum row, then minimum column).\n4. Locate the coordinates (mr, mc) of the top-leftmost main color (C) pixel (minimum row, then minimum column).\n5. In the output grid, change all pixels with the gray color (5) to white (0).\n6. Determine the starting coordinates (sr, sc) for a new diagonal line:\n   - If the column index of the top-leftmost gray pixel (`gc`) is greater than the column index of the top-leftmost main color pixel (`mc`), then the start point is (0, gc).\n   - Otherwise (if `gc` is less than or equal to `mc`), the start point is (gr, 0).\n7. Draw a diagonal line starting from the calculated coordinates (sr, sc). This line uses the main color (C) and extends downwards and to the right (incrementing both row and column indices by 1 at each step) until it goes beyond the grid boundaries. Set the pixels along this path in the output grid to the main color (C), overwriting any previous color at those locations.\n8.
