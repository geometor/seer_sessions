"""
Transforms the input grid according to the following rules:
1. Identify the main color (C), which is the unique color present in the grid that is not white (0) or gray (5).
2. Find the coordinates (gr, gc) of the top-leftmost gray (5) pixel (minimum row, then minimum column).
3. Find the coordinates (mr, mc) of the top-leftmost main color (C) pixel (minimum row, then minimum column).
4. Create the output grid by first copying the input grid.
5. In the output grid, change all gray (5) pixels to white (0).
6. Determine a starting point (sr, sc) for a new diagonal line based on the relative positions of the top-leftmost gray and main color pixels:
   - If the gray column `gc` is less than or equal to the main color column `mc` (gc <= mc), the start point is (gr, 0).
   - If the gray column `gc` is greater than the main color column `mc` (gc > mc):
     - If the gray row `gr` is less than the gray column `gc` (gr < gc), the start point is (0, gc).
     - Otherwise (if `gr >= gc`), the start point is (gr, 0).
7. Starting from the determined coordinates (sr, sc), draw a diagonal line using the main color C. This line extends downwards and to the right (incrementing row and column by 1 at each step) until it goes off the grid boundary. Pixels along this line are set to color C, overwriting any existing color.
