It also attempts to handle non-uniform grids by creating a diagonal matrix. However, it incorrectly fills both diagonals (main and anti-diagonal) with '5's in the non-uniform case, when it should only fill one or the other depending on variation within the original diagonals.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Refine the diagonal check:** Differentiate between the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal, checking for uniformity in *each* separately.\n2.  **Conditional Diagonal Fill:** Based on the uniformity checks, decide whether to fill the main diagonal, the anti-diagonal, or neither.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a summary of the results, with a focus on the failing cases:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Non-uniform (mixed 2s and 3s).\n    *   Expected: Main diagonal filled.\n    *   Actual: Both diagonals filled.\n    *    Main diagonal has different values (2 and 3)\n    *    Anti diagonal has different values (3 and 3)\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Non-uniform (mixed 2s, 3s, and 4s).\n    *   Expected: Anti-diagonal filled.\n    *   Actual: Both diagonals filled.\n        *    Main diagonal has different values (3, 2, 2)\n    *    Anti diagonal has different values (3, 2, 4)\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: Uniform (all 4s).\n    *   Expected: Top row filled.\n    *   Actual: Top row filled.\n    *   Result: **Correct**.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: Uniform (all 3s).\n    *   Expected: Top row filled.\n    *   Actual: Top row filled.\n    *   Result: **Correct**.\n\n*   **Example 5:**\n    *   Input: Non-uniform, but with uniform rows except the last.\n    *   Expected: main diagonal.\n    *   Actual: Both diagonals filled.\n    *    Main diagonal has different values (4 and 3)\n    *    Anti diagonal has different values (4 and 3)\n\n"
