The code prioritizes vertical adjacency, then horizontal, and finally diagonal. However, the test results show that this prioritization isn't universally correct. The examples demonstrate a more nuanced interaction between the White (0) and Gray (5) pixels, and a simple prioritization isn't capturing the complete rule. The strategy should shift from strict prioritization to a more holistic evaluation of the neighborhood of each Gray (5) pixel.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Adjacency:** Instead of prioritizing types of adjacency, we need to consider all adjacent White (0) pixels simultaneously.\n2.  **Count Neighbors:** Determine the *number* of White (0) neighbors, not just their presence or absence in specific directions.\n3.  **Refine Rules:** The existing code must be revised to incorporate the new information and refine the rule that produces the correct output, the rule that produces the correct results is not the one described on the code.\n4. **Iterative testing** Run the code and check results, revise the code until reach 100% accuracy\n\n**Gather Metrics and Analysis (using code execution):**\n\nTo get an idea of the output values:\n"
