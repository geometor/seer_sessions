objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9) representing a color

rules:
 - description: White pixels always transforms into Green
   input_color: 0
   output_color: 3

 - description: Gray pixels have a conditional transformation based on neighboring white cells.
   input_color: 5
   output_color:
        condition: >-
          If a gray pixel has one or more vertically adjacent white pixels,
          it should transform into a red pixel.
        output_color: 2

 - description: Gray pixels have a conditional transformation based on neighboring white cells.
   input_color: 5
   output_color:
        condition: >-
           If a gray pixel has one or more horizontally adjacent white pixels
           it should transform into a yellow pixel.
        output_color: 4

 - description: Gray pixels have a conditional transformation based on neighboring white cells.
   input_color: 5
   output_color:
        condition: >-
          If a gray pixel has only diagonally adjacent white pixel,
          it should transform into a green pixel.
