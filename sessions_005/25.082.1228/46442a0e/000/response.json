The input grids seem to consist of digits representing colors, and these digits are somehow replicated and rearranged in the output grid. The output grid appears to be a patterned expansion of the input grid, with a specific structure I need to decipher. There's a sense of mirroring and repetition, creating a larger, symmetrical pattern. The key seems to be understanding how the input grid's dimensions and elements relate to the output grid's dimensions and element arrangement.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
