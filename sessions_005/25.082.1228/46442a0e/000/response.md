Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grids seem to consist of digits representing colors, and these digits are somehow replicated and rearranged in the output grid. The output grid appears to be a patterned expansion of the input grid, with a specific structure I need to decipher. There's a sense of mirroring and repetition, creating a larger, symmetrical pattern. The key seems to be understanding how the input grid's dimensions and elements relate to the output grid's dimensions and element arrangement.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: "grid_transformation"
  - input_object: "input_grid"
    properties:
      - dimensions: "variable (e.g., 2x2, 3x3)"
      - elements: "digits (representing colors)"
  - output_object: "output_grid"
    properties:
      - dimensions: "larger than input_grid (specific relationship to input dimensions)"
      - elements: "digits from input_grid, replicated and rearranged"
  - transformation:
      - action: "expansion"
        details: "input grid is expanded into a larger grid"
      - action: "replication"
        details: "input grid elements are copied multiple times"
      - action: "arrangement"
        details: "replicated elements are arranged in a specific, symmetrical pattern (possibly mirroring and repetition)"
      - relation: "output dimensions are double the input"
      - relation: "output forms 2x2 copies of input"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Observe Input:** Take the input grid and note its dimensions (rows x columns).
2. **Double Dimensions:** Create a new grid, the output grid, where:
     *   rows count are doubled input grid count * 2
     *   columns count are doubled input grid count * 2
3. **Create Copies:** Create copies of the input grid.
4. **Arrange in a 2x2 layout, mirroring input.**
    * Place the original input grid in the top-left quadrant.
    * Place a horizontally mirrored copy of the input grid in the top-right quadrant.
    * Place a vertically mirrored copy of the input grid in the bottom-left quadrant.
    * Place a diagonally (both horizontally and vertically) mirrored copy of the input grid in the bottom-right quadrant.

In other words, the input grid is used as a "tile," and the output grid is a 2x2 tiling of that tile and its mirrored versions. Each quadrant of output grid has its unique mirroring.
