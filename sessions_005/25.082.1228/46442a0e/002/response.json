The primary issue seems to be an incorrect mirroring operation in the bottom-right quadrant. Specifically, the mirroring in example three does not appear to be a simple horizontal+vertical flip. It seems certain elements are being mirrored along different axis. We need to carefully examine the third example to understand the precise transformation occurring there.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Metric Gathering:** For the third example, we'll meticulously compare the input, expected output, and transformed output pixel by pixel. This will help pinpoint the exact discrepancies.\n2.  **Object Identification:** Re-examine the third example's input and output to define \"objects\" more accurately. Are we mirroring individual pixels, or are there larger structures (lines, shapes) being manipulated?\n3.  **Refine Mirroring Logic:** Based on the detailed comparison, we'll adjust the description of the bottom-right quadrant's transformation.\n4.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the program to reflect the corrected mirroring logic, ensuring it encompasses all three examples.\n\n**Gather Metrics (Example 3):**\n\nLet's get more specific measurements on the difference.\n\n"
