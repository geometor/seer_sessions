            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the idea of reflecting the grid across a bisecting line determined by a \"key corner\" where adjacent sides have the same color. This approach worked for some cases but failed to correctly transform all the provided examples. The core issue is that the reflection logic and the conditions for determining the type of reflection are not general enough to cover all the patterns present in the examples. Some examples have no \"key corner\" and follow other symmetry rules. The code needs a more robust way of identifying the correct transformation.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair to identify the specific transformation rule being applied. Don't assume it *must* be a simple reflection. Look for other patterns like rotations, specific pixel swaps, or more complex operations.\n2.  **Categorize Transformations:** Group the examples based on the *type* of transformation. This will help identify common patterns and develop corresponding code logic.\n3.  **Refine `find_key_corner` (or replace it):** The current `find_key_corner` function is too restrictive. We might need a more general function to identify the transformation type, or even separate functions for different transformation categories.\n4.  **Improve Reflection Logic:** The reflection logic itself needs adjustments. Instead of assuming a single bisecting line, consider reflections across horizontal, vertical, and diagonal axes, possibly determined by symmetry rather than just a key corner. Consider also special cases.\n5.  **Iterative Testing:** After each code modification, test against *all* examples to ensure we're not introducing regressions.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection for now, as code execution isn't directly applicable to the visual comparison):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 9 in top-left corner, rest is 9s.\n    *   Expected Output: 0s in top-left corner.\n    *   Actual Output: Incorrect reflection (flipped horizontally).\n    *   Observation: Top to Bottom reflection of the first column alone would give the correct result.\n    *   Metrics: 4 pixels off.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 6s along top, 0s in the middle, a mix on the bottom.\n    *   Expected Output: Appears to be a specific type of reflection, swapping elements across the diagonal from top-right to bottom-left, if the input were symmetrical, but it is not.\n    *   Actual Output: No change (identity transformation).\n    *   Observation: The output can be achieved if elements are swapped between the main diagonal and anti-diagonal positions in two passes: first pass, grid\\[0,0] with grid\\[2,2] and grid\\[0,1] with grid\\[1,2], second pass grid \\[0,2] with grid \\[2,0] and grid\\[1,0] with grid\\[2,1].\n    *    Metrics: 6 pixels off.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 0s in top-left 2x2, 9s elsewhere.\n    *   Expected Output: Reflection across vertical axis.\n    *   Actual Output: Incorrect (flipped horizontally).\n    *   Observation: Vertical reflection.\n    *   Metrics: 6 pixels off.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: 2s and 0s.\n    *   Expected Output: Appears like anti-diagonal swaps of some sort.\n    *   Actual Output: Incorrect reflection.\n    *   Observation: It seems the swap of positions are grid\\[0,2] with grid\\[2,0] alone.\n    *   Metrics: 2 pixels off.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
