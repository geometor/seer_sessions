Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids (likely images represented numerically) as input. The output is a single integer for each input grid. The grids themselves contain single-digit integers, which likely correspond to colors (as per the provided `COLOR_MAP`). A key observation is the consistent pattern in all input grids: they all appear to be symmetrical, either vertically, horizontally, or both. This suggests that the transformation might involve counting something related to symmetry or the number of non-zero elements that are not on the center cross.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: All input grids are 3x3.
  - observation: Input grids contain single-digit integers representing colors.
  - observation: All input grids exhibit symmetry (either vertical, horizontal, or both).
  - observation: the output is always a single integer
  - property: input_grid_size: 3x3
  - property: output_type: integer
  - relationship: input_grid -> transformation -> output_integer
  - action: count_non_zero_non_center_cross: Counts non-zero elements that are not on a center cross.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Receive a 3x3 grid of integers.
2.  **Process:** Examine each cell of grid.
3.  **Count:** Check cell is not zero.
4.   **Count:** Check cell is not on a center cross (row = 1 or col = 1)
5.  **Output:** the result of count

Essentially we count the number of non-zero color values are not on the center plus sign crossing the grid, and the result is output.
