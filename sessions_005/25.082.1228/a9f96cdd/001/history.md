Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and try to discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   The color '0' (white) seems to be the background or empty space.
*   The color '2' (red) appears to be the "active" color in the input grids.
*   The output grids seem to introduce new colors that are not present in the input, and the positioning appears related to the location of the '2' (red) pixels.
*    The output grids have the same height and width.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x5 (all examples)
      - content: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - background_color: 0 (white)
      - active_color: 2 (red)

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x5 (all examples)
      - content: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - background_color: 0 (white)
      - new_colors: [3, 6, 8, 7] (green, magenta, azure, orange)

  - observation: red_pixel_movement
    description: The position of the red pixel(s) in the input grid seems to dictate the positions of new colored pixels in the output grid.

  - observation: relative_positioning
    description: new colors are around where red was

  - observation: color_replacement
    description: color 2 never appears in output

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all pixels with the color '2' (red) in the input grid.
2.  **Transform:** Based on the position type of color 2, replace color 2, and add colors.
    *    If red is in a corner, replace with three other colors.
        *    Top Left corner, replace with a 3.
        *    Top Right corner, replace with a 6.
        *    Bottom Left corner, replace with an 8.
        *     Bottom Right corner, replace with a 7.
    *   If red in an edge (not corner):
        *   Top replace red with 3, 6
        *   Bottom replace with 8, 7
        *   Right replace with 3
        *   Left replace with 8, 7.
3.  **Output:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with '0' (white) as the background. Place the transformed numbers and colors in the new output.
