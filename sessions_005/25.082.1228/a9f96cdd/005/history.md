1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same size as the input grid, filled with 0 (white).

2.  **Red Pixel Identification:** Locate all pixels with the value 2 (red) in the input grid.

3.  **Transformation based on Red Pixel Location:**
    *   **Corners:**
        *   If the red pixel is at the top-left corner (0, 0), set output[0,0] = 3.
        *   If the red pixel is at the top-right corner (0, cols-1), set output[0,cols-1] = 6.
        *   If the red pixel is at the bottom-left corner (rows-1, 0), set output[rows-1,0] = 8.
        *   If the red pixel is at the bottom-right corner (rows-1, cols-1), set output[rows-1,cols-1] = 7.

    *   **Edges (non-corner):**
        *   If the red pixel is on the top edge (row 0, and not a corner): Set output[1,col-1] to 8, output[1, col+1] to 7.
        *   If the red pixel is on the bottom edge (row rows-1, and not a corner): set output[rows-2, col-1] to 3, and output[rows-2,col+1] = 6.
        *    If the red pixel is on the left edge (column 0, and not a corner): Set output[row-1,1] = 3 and output[row+1,1] = 6.
        *   If the red pixel is on the right edge (column cols-1, and not a corner): Set output[row - 1, cols - 2] to 3, output[row+1, cols-2] to 8, and output[row, cols -2]=0.

4.  **Output:** Return the modified `output_grid`.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a limited understanding derived from the first example. The subsequent tests reveal inconsistencies and errors. The primary issue is that the code *only* considers the position of the red pixel (2) and modifies the output grid *based solely on that position*. It doesn't correctly map the input red pixel to the output configuration. It seems there is a direct and consistent transformation of the red pixel to output pixel of the correct colors that form a + shape, but only centered at a specific cell. The initial code almost got the center of that + shape right (it is the location of the original red pixel), and it almost places the correct colors in the correct surrounding cells.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze *all* provided examples again, paying close attention to the relationship between the input red pixel and the output pattern. The expected outputs form a "+" or cross shape with colors 3,6,7,8, and maybe 0 (difficult to see white).
2.  **Identify the Center:** It appears the center of the "+" shape is directly related to where the input red pixel is. The original code tries to do that, but it's not working for all cases, especially off-center.
3.  **Consistent Offset:** Determine the consistent offset of the "+" shape. This is the core transformation rule, not the current one that tries to compute based on corners and edges.
4.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Clearly articulate the revised transformation rule in a new natural language program.
5. **Update the facts:** use a YAML block to represent object properties (location, color) for all four training examples

**Gather Metrics (using visual inspection since I cannot execute code yet):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Red Pixel: (1, 1)
    *   Expected Output Pattern Center: (1,1) Colors: 3 above, 6 below, 8 left, 7 right, 0 center
    *   Actual output is all zeros.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Red Pixel: (2, 4)
    *   Expected Output Pattern Center: (1,3) Colors: 3 above, 6 below, 8 left, 7 right, center is NOT part of the '+' pattern
    * Actual output is 7 at (2,4)

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Red Pixel: (0, 2)
    *   Expected Output Pattern Center:(1,2) Colors: 3 above, 6 below, 8 left, 7 right, center is NOT part of the '+' pattern
    * Actual output: partial match (8,7) adjacent to where red pixel was.

*   **Example 4:**
    * Input Red Pixel: (1,3)
    * Expected Output Pattern Center: (1,3):  Colors: 3 above, 6 below, 8 left, 7 right, center is NOT part of the '+' pattern
    *   Actual output is all zeros.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros (white).

2.  **Locate Red Pixel:** Find the coordinates (row, col) of the single red pixel (value 2) in the input grid.

3.  **Create "+" Pattern:** Create a "+" shaped pattern in the output grid, *centered* at the location of the input red pixel, adjusted by (-1,0) to be centered one row *above* red pixel.
    *   Set the output pixel at the adjusted location to 0.
    *   Set the output pixel directly above the adjusted center to 3 (green).
    *   Set the output pixel directly below the adjusted center to 6 (magenta).
    *   Set the output pixel to the left of the adjusted center to 8 (azure).
    *   Set the output pixel to the right of the adjusted center to 7 (orange).

4. **Edge Cases Handling**: If the calculated position for any part of the '+' is outside the bounds of the grid, do not place the corresponding colored pixel. (e.g. when Red is in row 0, no color 3 above. If red in col 0 no color 8, etc.)

5.  **Output:** Return the modified `output_grid`.
