The subsequent tests reveal inconsistencies in how red pixels (color 2) are transformed based on their position (corner, edge, and, implicitly, interior). The code doesn't correctly handle all edge cases and makes incorrect assumptions about how neighboring pixels should be modified. The strategy needs to focus on:\n\n1.  **Precise Corner Detection:** Ensure the corner logic is robust.\n2.  **Correct Edge Handling:** Differentiate between top, bottom, left, and right edges and apply the correct transformations. The provided code did not apply changes relative to the red pixel, like when it was on edges.\n3.  **Re-evaluate Neighborhood Modification**: Previous assumptions will be refined.\n4.  Consider the output color, and adjust color assignment.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Evidence:**\n\nI'll use numpy to confirm the coordinates of specific colors in each input and expected output grid and see what color is assigned to specific pixel.\n\n"
