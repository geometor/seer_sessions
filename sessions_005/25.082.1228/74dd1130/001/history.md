## train_1

**input:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both 3x3 grids of single-digit integers (representing colors).
*   **Colors/Values:** Each number corresponds to a color. The specific colors used vary between examples, but the structure is consistent.
*   **Spatial Arrangement:** The transformation involves a rearrangement of the color/number elements within the grid. It's not a simple mathematical operation on the values themselves.
*   **No External Information:** The transformation seems entirely self-contained within the grid; no external information or operations are apparent.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - rows: 3
      - columns: 3
      - color_values: variable, specific to each grid

actions:
  - name: rearrange_elements
    description: Elements of the input grid are reordered to form the output grid.
    details: The precise reordering rule is the core of the transformation.

relationships:
  - type: input-output
    description: Each input grid corresponds to a specific output grid after the transformation.
    element_mapping: The mapping of individual elements from input to output defines the transformation rule.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Receive a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers.
2.  **Transformation:**
    *    sort the columns

3.  **Output:** Produce the modified 3x3 grid.

The core concept is to perform column sort, the elements in each column are treated as individual elements.
