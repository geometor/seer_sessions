Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a single example and attempted to generalize a column-wise rearrangement based on color position diversity. However, the results on the subsequent examples show that this approach is incorrect. The high number of `pixels_off` in each case, along with the fact that only `size_correct` is consistently true, indicates a fundamental flaw in the transformation logic. The strategy needs to shift from prioritizing position diversity to a different rule that's consistent across all examples. It is not immediately clear what the rule is, so careful observation is needed.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Disregard the previous hypothesis entirely. Look at the input-output pairs of *all* examples as if seeing them for the first time. Look for simple patterns, object counts, relative positions, and basic operations (addition, subtraction, etc.) that might connect input to output. Pay very close attention to the individual pixel movements.
2.  **Focus on Per-Column Operations:** Given the problem involves column-wise rearrangement, the transformation rule likely operates independently on each column. This is a helpful constraint.
3.  **Hypothesize and Test (Mentally):** Formulate a new hypothesis. Before writing any code, mentally "test" it against *all* the provided examples to see if it holds.
4. Document findings in structured format.

**Metrics Gathering and Analysis:**

Let's create a summary first and confirm later with `tool_code`.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Independent Column Operations:** The transformation operates on each column of the input grid independently. There's no interaction *between* columns.

2.  **Column Sorting:** The values within each output column appear to maintain the input order *with the exception* that if multiple colors exist within the same column, the color that appears most frequently at the top of the column is sorted at the top.

3. **Priority of Top Colors** Examine each input column. Identify colors present. Within each column, colors at top take precedence for sorting.
