"""
The transformation rule is a reflection (transposition) of the input grid across the main diagonal, going from down-left up-right (secondary diagonal, anti-diagonal, counter-diagonal). Specifically, the element at position (row, col) in the input grid is moved to the position (n - 1- col, n-1 -row) in the output grid, where 'n' is the number of rows (which equals to the number of columns).

Another way: The output grid is generated by swapping the row and column indices, starting from 0, but flipped such that row `i` becomes column `n-1-i` and vice versa.
