Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the underlying transformation logic. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another 2D grid. The input grids appear to have uniform rows, meaning each row contains repetitions of the same value or a consistent sequence of values. The output grids seem to extract a representative element or sequence from each input row, effectively reducing the width of the grid to a single column or a shorter sequence. There's a strong emphasis on the vertical axis, as the output seems to be a vertical representation of the distinct rows in the input.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task_description:
  task_type: grid_transformation
  input_grid_properties:
    - rows_are_uniform_or_sequential: true
  output_grid_properties:
    - represents_input_rows: true
    - reduced_width: true
  transformations:
    - row_extraction: true
  relationships:
    - output_rows_correspond_to_input_rows: true
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.
2.  **Identify** distinct color values of the row. if the row is uniform, the distinct value will be the value. If the row has more than one distinct value, keep all the distinct values in the input order.
3. **Construct** a new row in the output grid that only contain the identified values.
4.  **Stack** these new rows vertically to form the output grid. The program could be summarized as "take unique values in order for each row".
