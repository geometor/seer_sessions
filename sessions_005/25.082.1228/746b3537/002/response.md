Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code focuses on extracting distinct values *within each row*, preserving their order, and stacking these extracted rows. This approach works for the first example but fails for others because it doesn't correctly reduce duplicate rows. The core issue is that the transformation should identify *distinct rows*, not distinct values within rows and consider the entire rows.

**Strategy:**

The strategy should shift from processing individual row elements to processing entire rows as single units. We need to identify and keep only the unique rows from the input grid.

**Gather Metrics and Evidence:**

Let's use code execution to get some general information.


``` python
import numpy as np

# Example data (replace with actual data from the task when available)
examples = [
    {
        "input": np.array([[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [1, 1, 1]]),
        "expected": np.array([[1], [2], [1]]),
        "output": np.array([[1], [2], [1]]),
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[3, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6]]),
        "expected": np.array([[3, 4, 6]]),
        "output": np.array([[3, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6]]),
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[2, 3, 3, 8, 1], [2, 3, 3, 8, 1], [2, 3, 3, 8, 1]]),
        "expected": np.array([[2, 3, 8, 1]]),
        "output": np.array([[2, 3, 8, 1], [2, 3, 8, 1], [2, 3, 8, 1]]),
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[2, 2], [6, 6], [8, 8], [8, 8]]),
        "expected": np.array([[2], [6], [8]]),
        "output": np.array([[2], [6], [8], [8]]),
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4], [2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2], [8, 8, 8, 8], [3, 3, 3, 3]]),
        "expected": np.array([[4], [2], [8], [3]]),
        "output": np.array([[4], [4], [2], [2], [8], [3]]),
    }
]

for i, example in enumerate(examples):
    input_shape = example['input'].shape
    expected_shape = example['expected'].shape
    output_shape = example['output'].shape
    match = np.array_equal(example['expected'], example['output'])

    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    print(f"  Input shape: {input_shape}")
    print(f"  Expected shape: {expected_shape}")
    print(f"  Output shape: {output_shape}")
    print(f"  Match: {match}")
    print("-" * 20)



```
```
Example 1:
  Input shape: (3, 3)
  Expected shape: (3, 1)
  Output shape: (3, 1)
  Match: True
--------------------
Example 2:
  Input shape: (3, 3)
  Expected shape: (1, 3)
  Output shape: (3, 3)
  Match: False
--------------------
Example 3:
  Input shape: (3, 5)
  Expected shape: (1, 4)
  Output shape: (3, 4)
  Match: False
--------------------
Example 4:
  Input shape: (4, 2)
  Expected shape: (3, 1)
  Output shape: (4, 1)
  Match: False
--------------------
Example 5:
  Input shape: (6, 4)
  Expected shape: (4, 1)
  Output shape: (6, 1)
  Match: False
--------------------

```
**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
observations:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: list of rows
      columns: list of columns
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: derived from unique rows of input_grid
      columns: determined by the longest unique row
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - action: row_extraction
    description: Extracting unique rows from the input grid.
    details: Each unique row in the input grid becomes a row in the output grid.
  - action: row_comparison
    description: compare rows of input for equality
    details: determine distinct rows by comparison

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Unique Rows:** Iterate through the input grid, treating each entire row as a single object.
2.  **Store Unique Rows:** Compare each row to the rows already identified as unique. If the current row is not identical to any previously stored unique row, add it to the list of unique rows.
3.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create the output grid by stacking the unique rows vertically, in the order they were encountered in the input grid.
4. if necessary, pad shorter rows with 0 (white)
