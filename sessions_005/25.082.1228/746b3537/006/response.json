            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the idea of extracting the first element of *unique* rows. However, the test results reveal a more nuanced pattern. While some examples (4 & 5) match this initial hypothesis, others (1, 2, & 3) do not. The code correctly identifies the first element of *each unique row*, but the expected outputs suggest we need the first element of *each unique row definition*, rather than checking uniqueness based on first element only. It seems the task requires identifying unique rows and then extracting the first element *of those rows*, maintaining the order of appearance.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Understanding:** The core issue is the misinterpretation of \"uniqueness.\" It's not about the uniqueness of the first *element*, but the uniqueness of the entire *row*.\n2.  **Revised Approach:** We need to store and compare entire rows for uniqueness, not just their first elements. The output should then consist of the first element of each of these unique rows, in the order they first appear.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using observations, no code execution needed for this specific task):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 1) (Expected), (2,1) (Actual)\n    *   Unique Rows: `[[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]]`\n    *   First elements of unique rows: `[1, 2]`\n    *   Result: Incorrect. The code extracted `[1,2]` but expect `[1,2,1]`\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (1,3) (Expected), (1,1) (Actual)\n    *   Unique Rows: `[[3, 4, 6]]`\n    *   First elements of unique rows: `[3]`\n    *    Result: Incorrect. The code extracted `[3]` but expect `[3,4,6]`\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: (1,4) (Expected), (1,1) (Actual)\n    *   Unique Rows: `[[2, 3, 3, 8, 1]]`\n    *   First elements of unique rows: `[2]`\n    *   Result: Incorrect. The code extracted `[2]` but expect`[2,3,8,1]`\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input Shape: (4, 2)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 1)\n    *   Unique Rows: `[[2, 2], [6, 6], [8, 8]]`\n    *   First elements of unique rows: `[2, 6, 8]`\n    *   Result: Correct.\n*   **Example 5:**\n    *   Input Shape: (6, 4)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 1)\n    *   Unique Rows: `[[4, 4, 4, 4], [2, 2, 2, 2], [8, 8, 8, 8], [3, 3, 3, 3]]`\n    *   First elements of unique rows: `[4, 2, 8, 3]`\n    *   Result: Correct.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
