Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another 2D grid. The input grids appear to have uniform rows, meaning each row contains repetitions of the same value or a consistent sequence of values. The output grids seem to extract a representative element or sequence from each input row, effectively reducing the width of the grid to a single column or a shorter sequence. There's a strong emphasis on the vertical axis, as the output seems to be a vertical representation of the distinct rows in the input.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
