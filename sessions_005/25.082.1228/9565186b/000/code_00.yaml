objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (consistent across all examples)
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9, representing colors)

actions:
  - type: color_substitution
    properties:
      - trigger_colors: [1, 2, 3, 8] # Colors present in original that seem to always change to grey
      - target_color: 5  # grey
      - condition: "If original value is one of the trigger colors, change to grey (5)"
      - scope: element-wise (each cell is considered independently)

relationships:
  - type: input_output
    properties:
      - transformation: color_substitution (as described above)
  - type: within_grid
    properties:
      - adjacency: not directly relevant in the observed transformation
      - spatial_pattern: no complex spatial patterns are apparent; the rule is element-based
