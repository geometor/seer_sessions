The key color appears to be '2' (red), with '0' (white) acting as a background or secondary color. The output seems to relate to some property of the red pixels within the input grid. The examples show variations in the arrangement and number of red pixels, so it looks to me that there will be a calculation involved based on the locations or count of red pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
