The input grids are larger and seem to be divided into two distinct regions based on color.\u00a0 One region consists of '9's (maroon) and '0's (white), while the other region consists of '1's (blue) and '0's (white). The output grids are smaller, always 3x3, and predominantly '0' (white) with some '2' (red) pixels. The '2' pixels in the output seem to correspond to a subset of the '9' pixels in the upper region of the input, and the placement appears mirrored or inverted. Specifically, '2' replaces '9' and empty locations are where '0' was. The lower region of 1's and 0's does not appear in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
