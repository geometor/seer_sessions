1.  **Identify Input Regions:** Divide the input grid into two regions: an "upper" region containing only '0' (white) and '9' (maroon) pixels, and a "lower" region containing '0' (white) and '1' (blue) pixels.

2.  **Focus on Upper Region:** Disregard the "lower" region entirely.

3.  **Extract Top Subgrid:** From the "upper" region, extract the top-left 3x3 subgrid.

4.  **Transform Pixels:** Within this 3x3 subgrid:
    *   Replace all '9' (maroon) pixels with '2' (red) pixels.
    *   Keep all '0' (white) pixels as '0' (white).

5. **Produce Output:** The resulting 3x3 subgrid after the pixel transformations is the output grid.
