Record all subgrids that perfectly match the output grid in terms of both dimensions and pixel values. Note the position of each match.\n3.  **Select Output Subgrid:** If multiple subgrids match the dimensions and values of the output grid, select the top-leftmost occurrence. The top-leftmost is defined as the subgrid with the smallest row index.
