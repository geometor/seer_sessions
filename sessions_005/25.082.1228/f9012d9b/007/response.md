1.  **Generate Subgrids:** Create all possible subgrids from the input grid, ranging in size from 1x1 up to the dimensions of the input grid itself.
2.  **Find Matching Subgrids:** Compare each generated subgrid with the expected output grid. Record all subgrids that perfectly match the output grid in terms of both dimensions and pixel values. Note the position of each match.
3.  **Select Output Subgrid:** If multiple subgrids match the dimensions and values of the output grid, select the top-leftmost occurrence. The top-leftmost is defined as the subgrid with the smallest row index. If multiple matching subgrids share the same smallest row index, select the one among them with the smallest column index.
