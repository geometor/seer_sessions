The zero values (white) in the inputs seem to act like a background or are ignored.\n*   The non-zero values appear to determine the output, and their count is significant.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The output grid will be square. The side of the square is equal to the count from Step 3.\n5.  **Populate Output:** Fill every cell of the output grid with the non-zero color identified in step 2.\n\nEssentially, the rule extracts the non-zero repeated color from the input, counts the occurrences, and creates a square output grid of that size filled with the extracted color.\n"
