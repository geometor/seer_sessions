Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a simple horizontal expansion by a factor of 2, copying each original column and then repeating it. This works to some extent, but the provided test results reveal discrepancies. The primary issue is the incorrect placement/repetition of columns in the expanded grid. The original strategy doesn't account for the specific mirroring/alternating pattern evident in the expected outputs. The strategy needs shifting from simple repetition to a more nuanced column insertion/copying logic that considers the relative positions.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Discrepancies:** Carefully compare the `Transformed Output` with the `Expected Output` for each example. Note the exact positions where pixels differ. Use python code to develop reports for this.
2.  **Refine the Rule:** Based on the observed differences, adjust the natural language program to accurately describe how the columns are duplicated and/or mirrored. The updated program will be essential information for developing an accurate solution.
3.  Present the metrics, facts, and the natural language program

**Metrics and Analysis (using code execution):**

I need to quantify the differences to derive the correct column mapping and determine the nature of the output grid.


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_discrepancies(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)
    transformed_output = np.array(transformed_output)

    diff = expected_output - transformed_output
    print(f'{diff=}')
    
    #check differences by row and column
    
    row_diff = np.sum(np.abs(diff), axis = 1)
    print(f'{row_diff=}')

    col_diff = np.sum(np.abs(diff), axis = 0)
    print(f'{col_diff=}')    


example_data = [
    {
        "input": [[0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 7], [0, 7, 7]],
        "expected": [[0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]],
        "transformed": [[0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]]
    },
    {
        "input": [[0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0]],
        "expected": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
        "transformed": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    },
    {
        "input": [[0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]],
        "expected": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
        "transformed": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    }
]

for i, example in enumerate(example_data):
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    analyze_discrepancies(example["input"], example["expected"], example["transformed"])
    print("-" * 20)

```
```
Example 1:
diff=array([[ 0,  7, -7, -7,  7,  0],
       [ 0,  0,  7,  7, -7, -7],
       [ 0,  7,  0,  0,  0, -7]])
row_diff=array([28, 28, 14])
col_diff=array([ 0, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14])
--------------------
Example 2:
diff=array([[ 0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0],
       [ 0,  7,  0,  0,  0, -7],
       [ 0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0]])
row_diff=array([ 0, 14,  0])
col_diff=array([0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7])
--------------------
Example 3:
diff=array([[ 0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0],
       [ 0, -7,  0,  0,  0,  7],
       [ 0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0]])
row_diff=array([ 0, 14,  0])
col_diff=array([0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7])
--------------------

```
**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
observations:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2D array of pixels
      - values: integers representing colors (0-9)
    transformations:
      - type: horizontal expansion
        details: |
          The grid is expanded to double its original width.
          The original columns are preserved.
          New columns are inserted between the original columns and and at the right.
          The content of the new columns is a copy of original columns, sequenced from the left, wrapping around to the beginning
          The last column may be a copy of the first column.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double the Width:** Create a new output grid with the same height as the input grid but twice the width.
2.  **Copy Original Columns:** Copy each column from the input grid to the corresponding even-indexed column in the output grid (e.g., input column 0 goes to output column 0, input column 1 goes to output column 2, etc.).
3. **Fill the Gaps:**
   The odd-numbered columns are filled by copying the *i*th column to the *2i+1* column.
