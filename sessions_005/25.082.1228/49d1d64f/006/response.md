Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to adjust the approach:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was a good first attempt, implementing the core idea of expanding the input grid by duplicating pixels. However, it's clear from the test results that the bordering logic is incorrect. The output grids are too large, and the border isn't being applied as intended in the examples. The expected outputs show a single-pixel border along only the top and bottom edges, not all the way around.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Bordering:** Modify the code to add a border of '0's only to the top and bottom of the *expanded* grid, not all around. This means adjusting the output grid size calculation and the indexing during pixel duplication.
2.  **Verify Size:** Double-check the output grid dimensions. The height should be `(input_rows * 2) + 2`, and the width should be `input_cols * 2`.
3.  Develop metrics using code to determine and verify.
4. Re-write the natural language program, then write the code.

**Metrics Gathering (using code execution):**

Let's verify the expected dimensions and some pixel counts to solidify our understanding.


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)

    input_rows, input_cols = input_grid.shape
    expected_rows, expected_cols = expected_output.shape

    print(f"Input Dimensions: {input_rows} x {input_cols}")
    print(f"Expected Output Dimensions: {expected_rows} x {expected_cols}")

    #check sizes:

    expected_height = (input_rows * 2) + 2
    expected_width = input_cols * 2

    print(f"Expected height by rule: {expected_height}")
    print(f"Expected width by rule: {expected_width}")

    print(f"Height matches rule: {expected_rows == expected_height}")
    print(f"Width matches rule: {expected_cols == expected_width}")

    # count zeros in expected
    expected_zeros = np.sum(expected_output == 0)
    print(f"Expected zeros: {expected_zeros}")
    print(f"Expected Zero count matches 2 * width: {expected_zeros == 2 * expected_width}")


examples = [
    ([[1, 2], [3, 8]], [[0, 1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2, 2], [3, 3, 8, 8], [0, 3, 8, 0]]),
    ([[1, 8, 4], [8, 3, 8]], [[0, 1, 8, 4, 0], [1, 1, 8, 8, 4, 4], [8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8], [0, 8, 3, 8, 0]]),

]

for i, (input_grid, expected_output) in enumerate(examples):
    print(f"\n--- Example {i + 1} ---")
    analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output)

Okay, I had a small error in my testing script - was trying to create numpy arrays from lists with inconsistent dimensions. I will fix this.

``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)

    input_rows, input_cols = input_grid.shape
    expected_rows, expected_cols = expected_output.shape

    print(f"Input Dimensions: {input_rows} x {input_cols}")
    print(f"Expected Output Dimensions: {expected_rows} x {expected_cols}")

    #check sizes:

    expected_height = (input_rows * 2) + 2
    expected_width = input_cols * 2

    print(f"Expected height by rule: {expected_height}")
    print(f"Expected width by rule: {expected_width}")

    print(f"Height matches rule: {expected_rows == expected_height}")
    print(f"Width matches rule: {expected_cols == expected_width}")

    # count zeros in expected
    expected_zeros = np.sum(expected_output == 0)
    print(f"Expected zeros: {expected_zeros}")
    print(f"Expected Zero count matches 2 * width: {expected_zeros == 2 * expected_width}")


examples = [
    ([[1, 2], [3, 8]], [[0, 1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2, 2], [3, 3, 8, 8], [0, 3, 8, 0]]),
    ([[1, 8, 4], [8, 3, 8]], [[0, 1, 8, 4, 0], [1, 1, 8, 8, 4, 4], [8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8], [0, 8, 3, 8, 0]]),

]

for i, (input_grid, expected_output) in enumerate(examples):
    print(f"\n--- Example {i + 1} ---")
    analyze_example(input_grid, [list(row) for row in expected_output])

I seem to be stuck on creating numpy arrays correctly when the rows have different lengths, I am going to refactor to use a simpler list comprehension to convert to numpy arrays.

``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output = np.array([np.array(row) for row in expected_output])

    input_rows, input_cols = input_grid.shape
    expected_rows, expected_cols = expected_output.shape

    print(f"Input Dimensions: {input_rows} x {input_cols}")
    print(f"Expected Output Dimensions: {expected_rows} x {expected_cols}")

    #check sizes:

    expected_height = (input_rows * 2) + 2
    expected_width = input_cols * 2

    print(f"Expected height by rule: {expected_height}")
    print(f"Expected width by rule: {expected_width}")

    print(f"Height matches rule: {expected_rows == expected_height}")
    print(f"Width matches rule: {expected_cols == expected_width}")

    # count zeros in expected
    expected_zeros = np.sum(expected_output == 0)
    print(f"Expected zeros: {expected_zeros}")
    print(f"Expected Zero count matches 2 * width: {expected_zeros == 2 * expected_width}")


examples = [
    ([[1, 2], [3, 8]], [[0, 1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2, 2], [3, 3, 8, 8], [0, 3, 8, 0]]),
    ([[1, 8, 4], [8, 3, 8]], [[0, 1, 8, 4, 0], [1, 1, 8, 8, 4, 4], [8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8], [0, 8, 3, 8, 0]]),

I am still running into problems. I am going to try a different tact and convert them individually.

``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output_rows = []
    for row in expected_output:
        expected_output_rows.append(np.array(row))
    expected_output = np.array(expected_output_rows)


    input_rows, input_cols = input_grid.shape
    expected_rows, expected_cols = expected_output.shape

    print(f"Input Dimensions: {input_rows} x {input_cols}")
    print(f"Expected Output Dimensions: {expected_rows} x {expected_cols}")

    #check sizes:

    expected_height = (input_rows * 2) + 2
    expected_width = input_cols * 2

    print(f"Expected height by rule: {expected_height}")
    print(f"Expected width by rule: {expected_width}")

    print(f"Height matches rule: {expected_rows == expected_height}")
    print(f"Width matches rule: {expected_cols == expected_width}")

    # count zeros in expected
    expected_zeros = np.sum(expected_output == 0)
    print(f"Expected zeros: {expected_zeros}")
    print(f"Expected Zero count should be 2 * width: {2 * expected_width}")

    ([[1, 8, 4], [8, 3, 8]], [[0, 1, 8, 4, 0], [1, 1, 8, 8, 4, 4], [8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8], [0, 8, 3, 8, 0]]),
