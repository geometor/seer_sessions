          If first row input are not all the same, output first row are all 0s.
    general_rule: |
        The first row of the output is all 5s if all values of the input first row are the same, otherwise the first row is all 0s. Subsequent rows of the output grid are all 0s if their unique values are a subset of the input first row's unique values. If not a subset, they are all 5s.
