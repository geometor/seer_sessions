objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Contains pixels representing colors.
  - name: pixel
    type: integer
    description: Represents a color in the grid.
  - name: contiguous_block
    type: list of tuples
    description: A group of adjacent pixels with the same color.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (e.g., 2 for red).
      - bottom_right_pixel: The pixel in the block with the largest row index, and among those, the largest column index.

actions:
  - name: identify_contiguous_blocks
    input: grid, color
    output: list of contiguous_block
    description: Finds all contiguous blocks of a specified color in the grid.
  - name: find_bottom_right_pixel
    input: contiguous_block
    output: pixel coordinates (tuple)
    description: Determines the bottom-right pixel within a contiguous block.
  - name: transform_pixel
    input: grid, pixel coordinates, color
    output: modified grid
    description: Changes the color of a specific pixel in the grid.

transformation_rule:
  - For each contiguous block of red (2) pixels in the input grid:
    - Find the bottom-right pixel of the block.
    - Change the color of this pixel to blue (1).
  - All other pixels remain unchanged.
