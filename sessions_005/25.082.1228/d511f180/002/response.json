            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were too specific to the first example. The code focuses solely on the second column and a very particular neighbor-comparison rule. The subsequent examples demonstrate that this rule doesn't hold universally. The core issue is that the initial hypothesis was overly narrow and didn't capture the underlying pattern that generalizes across all examples. My strategy will be to:\n\n1.  **Broaden the Scope:** Instead of focusing only on the second column, I need to consider all cells in the grid.\n2.  **Refine the Condition:** The neighbor comparison needs to be more flexible and possibly involve more than just the top and left neighbors. It's highly likely it relates to other columns.\n3.  **Identify the True Pattern** I need to go back and look to find a pattern that works in ALL cases.\n4.  **Use Code to Check assumptions** I want a tool that can help me to visualize the differences in grids to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Analyze Examples:**\n\nTo better understand the discrepancies, I'll use a `numpy` to compare the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example. This will help visualize where the code is going wrong.\n\n"
