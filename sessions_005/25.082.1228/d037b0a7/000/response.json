Here's my breakdown of the input-output examples:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 3x3 grids with single-digit integer values representing colors. It appears that a specific transformation is applied based on the location and values of non-zero pixels. The zero-valued pixels (white) seem to act as a background or unchanged elements. The most prominent feature is the propagation or filling of certain colors downwards, seemingly influenced by other colors in the grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
