Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code (`code_00.py`) were based on a single example, and it's clear that the rule (transpose and then reverse rows) doesn't hold for the second example. The core issue is that the initial hypothesis was too simple and didn't capture the actual underlying transformation. The strategy needs to shift from simple transposition/reversal to potentially identifying objects, their properties, and how they're being rearranged or transformed. Since the first example transformation *almost* works for the second (just needs to swap columns 1 and 3, in other words shift column one to the right twice), we will need to look closely to decide if the initial hypothesis is valid.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Object Identification:** We need to determine if there are consistent "objects" (contiguous blocks of the same color) that are being manipulated, or if the transformation acts on individual pixels regardless of their neighbors.
2.  **Relationship Analysis:** If objects exist, we need to analyze how their positions, shapes, or colors change from input to output.
3.  **Refined Rule Formulation:** Based on the analysis of multiple examples, we'll develop a more comprehensive natural language program that accurately describes the transformation.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the refined rule against each example. If the rule does not hold, gather information on why not.

**Gather Metrics and Evidence:**

I'll analyze each example, comparing the input, expected output, and the output generated by `code_00.py`.

**Example 1 Analysis:**

*   **Input:**
    
```
    3 3 8
    3 7 0
    5 0 0
    ```

*   **Expected Output:**
    
```
    0 0 5
    0 7 3
    8 3 3
    ```

*   **`code_00.py` Output:**
    
```
    5 3 3
    0 7 3
    0 0 8
    ```


Metrics collected during the run:
match: False
pixels\_off: 6
size\_correct: True
color\_palette\_correct: True

*Observations*: the generated output is very close to the correct output, columns 1 and 3 appear to be swapped.

**Example 2 Analysis:**

*   **Input:**
    
```
    5 5 2
    1 0 0
    0 0 0
    ```

*   **Expected Output:**
    
```
    0 0 0
    0 0 1
    2 5 5
    ```

*   **`code_00.py` Output:**
    
```
    0 1 5
    0 0 5
    0 0 2
    ```

Metrics collected during the run:
match: False
pixels\_off: 6
size\_correct: True
color\_palette\_correct: True

*Observations*: the generated output is very close to the correct output, columns 1 and 3 appear to be swapped.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule almost performs a transposition of the input grid followed by reversing each row of the result. The only difference between this simple rule and the correct output is that column 1 and column 3 of the expected result have been swapped.

The program comprises these steps:

1.  **Transpose:** Transpose the input grid (swap rows and columns).
2.  **Reverse Rows:** Reverse each row in the transposed grid.
3.  **Swap Columns:** Swap the first and third columns of the result.
