The transformation involves these steps:

1. **Transpose:** Transpose the input grid (swap rows and columns).
2. **Reverse Rows:** Reverse each row in the transposed grid.
3. **Conditional Column Swap (refined):**
   - After transposing and reversing, examine the *original* input grid.
   - If the original input was 3x3, swap columns 1 and 3 in the *transformed* grid. It is critical this is done *after* the reversing.

Here's an analysis of the results and a plan to refine the natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial program, involving transposition and row reversal, captures part of the transformation but fails to correctly handle the positioning of elements in both examples. The conditional column swap intended for 3x3 grids is not achieving the desired effect, and it's also being applied when it potentially shouldn't be (as seen in the second example, which is not 3x3). It appears that we're close to the concept of a 90-degree rotation, so there might be an issue about when the row reversal should happen.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine the examples:** Carefully analyze both input/output pairs to pinpoint the exact movement of each element. It looks like clockwise rotations and/or reflections, so we'll pay close attention to how coordinates change.
2.  **Disregard previous swap logic:** The column-swap idea, especially conditional, seems too brittle. It appears that rotation is all that is needed.
3.  **Focus on rotations:** Implement 90-degree clockwise rotation and re-test.
4.  **Metrics:** Use the python tools to provide accurate metrics.

**YAML Facts:**

    shape: (3, 3)
    unique_values: [0, 3, 5, 7, 8]
    description: A 3x3 grid with various colors.
  output:
    shape: (3, 3)
    unique_values: [0, 3, 5, 7, 8]
    description: A 3x3 grid with the same colors as input, rearranged.
  transformation:
    type: rotation
    degrees: 90 clockwise

example2:
  input:
    shape: (3, 3)
    unique_values: [0, 1, 2, 5]
    description: A 3x3 grid.
  output:
    shape: (3, 3)
    unique_values: [0, 1, 2, 5]
    description: A 3x3 grid with the same colors as the input.
  transformation:
    type: rotation
    degrees: 90 clockwise
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input grid.
This can be implemented by first transposing the matrix and then reversing each row.
