examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input:
      shape: (3, 3)
      colors: [0, 3, 5, 7, 8] #gray, green, gray, orange, azure
    output:
      shape: (3, 3)
      colors: [0, 3, 5, 7, 8] #gray, green, gray, orange, azure
    observations:
      - The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
      - The input and output grids contain the same set of colors.
      - first column of input becomes the last row of output
      - second column of input becomes the second to last row of output
      - last column of input becomes the first row of the output
