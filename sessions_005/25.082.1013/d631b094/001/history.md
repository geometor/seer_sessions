Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The input grids appear to have a common structure: a single non-zero color embedded within a field of zeros. The output grids seem to be a condensed representation, showing only the non-zero color from the input, repeated a number of times that relates to its occurrences or positions in the input. The size of output grid doesn't match the size of input grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids are rectangular and contain a single non-zero color surrounded by zeros.
  - object_types:
      - name: input_grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array
          - values: integers (0-9)
          - description: Contains a single non-zero color and zeros.
      - name: output_grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array
          - values: integers (0-9)
          - description: Contains only the non-zero color from the input, repeated.
  - relationships:
      - type: spatial
        description: The non-zero color appears in different positions within the input grid.
      - type: transformational
        description: The output grid is derived from the input grid by extracting and repeating the non-zero color.
  - actions:
    - type: identification
      description: identify the non zero color from the grid
    - type: counting
      description: count the horizontal or vertical occurrences somehow
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the single non-zero color (pixel value) present in the input grid.
2.  **Count** the number of times the non-zero color appears in the rows and/or columns of the input grid, OR count the number of rows and/or columns that contain it. It's unclear at this stage if counting by element or by row/col, more examples needed to know for sure.
3.   Determine the dimensions of output. Number of non-zero values on each row, or number of rows containing non zero values, or some combination. More examples are needed to discern this.
4.  **Create** an output grid consisting solely of the identified non-zero color, repeated according to calculated dimension above.
