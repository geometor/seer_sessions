facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids are rectangular and contain a single non-zero color surrounded by zeros.
  - object_types:
      - name: input_grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array
          - values: integers (0-9)
          - description: Contains a single non-zero color and zeros.
      - name: output_grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array
          - values: integers (0-9)
          - description: Contains only the non-zero color from the input, repeated.
  - relationships:
      - type: spatial
        description: The non-zero color appears in different positions within the input grid.
      - type: transformational
        description: The output grid is derived from the input grid by extracting and repeating the non-zero color.
  - actions:
    - type: identification
      description: identify the non zero color from the grid
    - type: counting
      description: count the horizontal or vertical occurrences somehow
