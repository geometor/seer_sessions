The output grid always consists of a single color repeated across all cells. The key seems to be identifying which color from the input grid will be used to fill the output grid. It appears that the color in the center of the grid is not used. It also appears the upper and lower right cells are not used. It looks like the selected color exists along the top row, and it is not the last color on that row.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
