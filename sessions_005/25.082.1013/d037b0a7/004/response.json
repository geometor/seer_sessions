            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for refining the natural language program and the code.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code have partially captured the transformation rule, but there are clear discrepancies in the first two examples. The horizontal propagation seems to be overly aggressive, filling pixels to the leftmost edge regardless of intervening non-zero pixels, and the vertical propagation is not conditional based on zero valued pixels. The third example works correctly, but this is likely coincidental.\n\nThe main strategy should be to:\n\n1.  **Correct Horizontal Propagation:** Modify the horizontal propagation rule to stop at any non-zero pixel, not just the edge.\n2.  **Correct Vertical Propagation:** Modify the vertical propagation to only propagate downwards when the value is zero valued pixel\n3. **Re-evaluate Examples:** Ensure that the corrected natural language program accurately accounts for *all* provided examples.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including targeted metrics to pinpoint the issues:\n\n*Example 1:*\n\n*   **Input:** 3x3 grid with non-zero values 6, 4, and 3.\n*   **Expected Output:** Shows a combination of horizontal and vertical propagation. The '6' propagates to the left, 4 remains, 3 propagates. Downward propagation fills below.\n*   **Transformed Output:** Incorrect. Horizontal spread is too aggressive.\n*    Error Metrics:*\n    - Pixels Off: 3\n    - top left value should be a zero and it's a 6\n\n*Example 2:*\n\n*   **Input:** 3x3 grid with non-zero values 2, 7, and 8.\n*   **Expected Output:** '2' remains in place, 7 and 8 fill down\n*   **Transformed Output:**  Almost correct, only the first pixel (0,0) is not correctly identified.\n*   *Error Metrics:*\n    - Pixels off = 1\n    - first pixel should be zero\n\n*Example 3:*\n\n*   **Input:** 3x3 grid\n*   **Expected Output:** propagation down\n*   **Transformed Output:** Correct (likely coincidentally, as the logic is still flawed).\n*   *Error Metrics:*\n    - none, correct\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
