Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (representing colors). The transformation seems to involve a directional fill or expansion of non-zero values. It appears as if non-zero values on the right "drag a copy" to the left, cascading across the other non-zero values. A single non-zero value expands downwards, and adjacent values propagate downwards. The rule appears to be a combination of these and requires more investigation

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: Non-zero values in the input grid appear to influence the output grid.
  - observation: Zero values in the input grid are sometimes replaced by non-zero values in the output grid.
  - observation: The bottom right value in train_1 input and output is `6`.
  - observation: The transformation seems like a directional propagation or fill operation.
  - relationship: train_1: The top-right value (6) propagates to the left along the row and then propagates down, carrying the row values with it.
  - relationship: train_2: The middle-right value (8) propagates to the left and down.
  - relationship: train_3: The top-left value (4) propagates downwards.
  - hypothesis: non-zero value in the last column or bottom row may cause propagation.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the starting point:** Find all values in the right-most column.
2.  **Horizontal Propagation:** For each starting cell, copy the cell's value to all the cells to the left of it in the same row *up until* another non-zero is encountered.
3. **Vertical propagation**: For the last row and right-most cell, fill upwards and leftwards respectively (until the first non-zero pixel)
4. **Downward Propagation:** Starting from the top row and down, and left to right in each row, propagate each non-zero pixel directly down to the bottom of the grid.

This natural language program describes "dragging" a value and downward expansion.
