Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid.\n*   Each grid consists of two rows of equal length, filled with single-digit numbers representing colors.\n*   The input grids have two distinct colors, one for each row.\n*   The output grid seems to be an interleaving of the colors from the input rows, a kind of color swap or re-arrangement of colors.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
