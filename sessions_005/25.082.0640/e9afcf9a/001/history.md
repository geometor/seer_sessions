## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9
```


**output:**
```
3 9 3 9 3 9
9 3 9 3 9 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
4 4 4 4 4 4
8 8 8 8 8 8
```


**output:**
```
4 8 4 8 4 8
8 4 8 4 8 4
```

Okay, I'm ready to analyze this task and provide my observations.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two rectangular grids in both the input and output. The input grids consist of two rows, each filled with a single, repeating color. The output grids also have two rows, but the colors alternate between the two colors from the input. The dimensions of the input and output grids are the same.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**


```yaml
observations:
  - type: object
    description: Input grid
    properties:
      - rows: 2
      - columns: 6
      - row1_color: varies (3 in example 1, 4 in example 2)
      - row2_color: varies (9 in example 1, 8 in example 2)

  - type: object
    description: Output grid
    properties:
      - rows: 2
      - columns: 6
      - row1_pattern: alternating colors from input row1 and row2
      - row2_pattern: alternating colors from input row2 and row1, offset from row1

  - type: relationship
    description: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.

  - type: action
    description: Colors in the output grid alternate, taking values from the two input rows.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Input:** Obtain the input grid, noting its dimensions (rows and columns) and the color of each row. Let's call the color of the first row `color1` and the color of the second row `color2`.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  **Populate Output Row 1:** For the first row of the output grid, alternate between `color1` and `color2`, starting with `color1`.
4.  **Populate Output Row 2:** For the second row of the output grid, alternate between `color2` and `color1`, starting with `color2`.
5. return the resulting output grid.
