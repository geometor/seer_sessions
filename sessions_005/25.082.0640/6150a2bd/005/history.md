The transformation rule is a reflection (mirroring) of the input grid across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right). This is equivalent to transposing the grid, swapping rows and columns. The pixel at position (x, y) in the input grid moves to position (y, x) in the output grid. Colors remain unchanged.

Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for updating the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis of a simple diagonal reflection (transposition) is incorrect. While the output grid's dimensions are correctly swapped (rows become columns and vice-versa), the pixel arrangement isn't a simple transposition. The errors in both examples indicate a more complex transformation. The consistent `pixels_off` count of 6 in both examples, despite different grid sizes, suggests a patterned error related to the specific transformation logic, and not random misplacement. My strategy is to:

1.  Carefully analyze the pixel movements in both examples.
2.  Identify a consistent pattern beyond simple transposition.
3.  Re-formulate the natural language program and code to reflect this pattern.
4.  Use tool\_code to programmatically compare input, expected and actual output.

**Gather Metrics and Evidence:**

I'll use `tool_code` to analyze the differences between the expected and transformed outputs, focusing on the specific indices that differ.

def analyze_differences(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)
    transformed_output = np.array(transformed_output)

    diff_expected = np.where(input_grid != expected_output)

# Example 1
input_grid1 = [[3, 3, 8], [3, 7, 0], [5, 0, 0]]
expected_output1 = [[0, 0, 5], [0, 7, 3], [8, 3, 3]]
transformed_output1 = [[3, 3, 5], [3, 7, 0], [8, 0, 0]]

transformed_output2 = [[5, 1, 0], [5, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0]]

Analysis for Example 1:
Indices where input differs from expected output:
(array([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]), array([0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2]))
Indices where input differs from transformed output:
(array([0, 2]), array([2, 0]))
Indices where expected and transformed outputs differ:
(array([0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]), array([0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2]))

Analysis for Example 2:
Indices where input differs from expected output:
(array([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]), array([0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2]))
Indices where input differs from transformed output:
(array([0, 0, 1, 2]), array([1, 2, 0, 0]))
Indices where expected and transformed outputs differ:
(array([0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]), array([0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2]))

```
**Observations from Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:** The transformed output differs from the expected output at 6 specific index pairs. The original code correctly swaps some positions, but it fails in others.
*   **Example 2:** A similar pattern emerges. Again 6 index pairs where expected and transformed outputs differ.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
examples:
  - id: 1
    input_grid: [[3, 3, 8], [3, 7, 0], [5, 0, 0]]
    expected_output: [[0, 0, 5], [0, 7, 3], [8, 3, 3]]
    observations:
      - The input grid is 3x3.
      - The output grid is 3x3.
      - The transformation involves rotating/flipping and shifting.
      - It is not a simple transposition.
  - id: 2
    input_grid: [[5, 5, 2], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
    expected_output: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [2, 5, 5]]
    observations:
      - The input grid is 3x3.
      - The output grid is 3x3.
       - The transformation involves rotating/flipping and shifting.
      - It is not a simple transposition.

transformation_type: "Rotation and Color Swap"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule involves a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation of the input grid, *followed by swapping rows and columns*.
In example 1.

*   (0,0) -> (0,2)
*   (0,1) -> (1,2)
*   (0,2) -> (2,2)
*   (1,0) -> (0,1)
*   (1,1) -> (1,1)
*   (1,2) -> (2,1)
*   (2,0) -> (0,0)
*   (2,1) -> (1,0)
*   (2,2) -> (2,0)

After the rotation, the first row becomes last column, and the last row becomes first column and the middle row becomes middle column. Then we swap rows and columns, so the result will be that the columns have become rows and rows have become columns, which we observed.

The overall process is more easily represented as a *clockwise rotation*, which means that the last column becomes the first row, the second-to-last column becomes second row, and so forth.
