Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both grids of single-digit integers (representing colors).
*   **Colors:** Each number corresponds to a color. The same colors appear to be present in both input and output, but rearranged.
*   **Size change:** Input grids are not the same size as output grids.
*  **Rotation:** It seems like a 90 degree rotation may have taken place and the values in the input and output grids seem to have switched places, let's investigate further.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: variable
      columns: variable
      cells: integers (0-9) representing colors

transformations:
  - type: rotation
    direction: clockwise
    degrees: 90
  - type: value_swap #mirror
    properties:
       axis: vertical

relationships:
  - type: color-mapping
    description: Each integer corresponds to a specific color.
  - type: position-mapping
    description: cell positions in the new grid switch with each other

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Rotate:** Take the entire input grid and rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.
2.  **Mirror**: swap the values across the vertical axis. Imagine putting a mirror down the center column. the left and right side values are swapped.

Essentially, it does a 90 degree clockwise rotation combined with a vertical value swap of cell values.
