These pixels are designated as \"seed\" pixels.\n\n2.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid. Preserve all original seed pixel values.\n\n3.  **Downward Propagation (Precedence):**\n    *   Each seed pixel initiates a downward propagation of its color value within its respective column.\n    *   This propagation continues until one of the following conditions is met:\n        *   The bottom row of the grid is reached.\n        *   An obstruction is hit - a non-zero cell is encountered, including\n            other seed pixels and cells filled by another downward propigation.\n\n4.  **Rightward Propagation:**\n    *   Each seed pixel initiates a rightward propagation of its color value within its respective row.\n    *   This propagation continues until one of the following conditions is met:\n        *   The rightmost column of the grid is reached.\n        *   An obstruction is hit - if the cell directly below is not zero or if\n            the cell has already been filled by a previous downward propigation\n\n5.  **Output:** The output grid, now modified by the propagation rules, represents the final transformed grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_nonzero_pixels(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the coordinates of all non-zero pixels in the grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = np.where(grid != 0)\n    return list(zip(rows, cols))\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    height, width = input_grid.shape\n\n    # get non-zero pixels\n    nonzero_pixels = get_nonzero_pixels(input_grid)\n\n    # if no non-zero pixels, return original grid\n    if not nonzero_pixels:\n      return output_grid\n\n    # Propagate downwards first (higher precedence)\n    for r, c in nonzero_pixels:\n        val = input_grid[r,c]\n        # Propagate down\n        for i in range(r + 1, height):\n            if output_grid[i, c] != 0 and (i,c) not in nonzero_pixels: # Check if another downward prop already filled this cell\n              break  #stop the downward prop if it hit a filled cell\n            output_grid[i, c] = val\n\n    # Propagate rightwards (lower precedence)\n    for r, c in nonzero_pixels:\n        val = input_grid[r, c]\n\n        # Propagate right\n        for j in range(c + 1, width):\n          # check if the cell below is not zero, or if this cell was\n          # already filled by downwards prop\n          if (r+1 < height and output_grid[r+1,j] != 0) or output_grid[r, j] != 0:\n            break\n          else:\n            output_grid[r, j] = val\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
