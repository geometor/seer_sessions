facts:
  - object: seed_pixel
    description: A pixel with a non-zero value in the input grid.
    properties:
      - value: The color/value of the pixel (1-9).
      - coordinates: Row and column position in the grid.
  - object: propagated_pixel
    description: A pixel that receives its value from a seed pixel.
    properties:
      - value: The color/value inherited from a seed pixel.
      - coordinates: Row and column position in the grid.
  - action: propagate_down
    description:  Extends the seed pixel's value downwards in the same column. Stops if it encounters an existing value from another downward propagation.
    precedence: Higher than propagate_right.
  - action: propagate_right
    description: Extends the seed pixel's value rightwards in the same row.
    precedence: Lower than propagate_down.
  - grid: input_grid
    description: 2D array of color values.
  - grid: output_grid
    description: 2D array, transformed by rule.
