Here's an analysis of the results and a plan to improve the natural language program and the code:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first example, which it handles correctly. However, the subsequent examples reveal a flaw in the rightward propagation logic. The rightward propagation should stop *before* a cell that has already been filled by downward propagation. The current code propagates rightward even if a downward prop has filled in the value, it just checks if original output value is zero

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Rightward Propagation:** Modify the natural language program and the code to explicitly state and implement the blocking condition for rightward propagation: a cell filled by downward propagation (from any seed) blocks rightward propagation.

2.  **Detailed Analysis of Examples:** Examine each example closely to pinpoint exactly where the current logic fails and why the updated rule will fix it.

**Gather Metrics (using visual inspection of outputs - I will use tool execution in later stages when necessary)**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Pixels Changed: All.
    *   Correct: Yes.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Pixels Changed:
        *   Expected: (1,1) changes to 2.
        *   Actual: (0,2) change to 2
    *   Correct: No. One pixel off.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Pixels Changed:
        *   Expected:(1,0) changes to 4 and (2,0) changes to 4 and (1,1)
            changes to 2
        *   Actual: many, many incorrect changes.
    *   Correct: No. Three Pixels are off

**YAML Fact Representation**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - height: variable
      - width: variable
      - cells: contain color values (0-9)

  - name: seed_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: non-zero value
      - location: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: propagate_down
    description: Extends a seed pixel's color downwards in its column.
    preconditions:
      - Source cell is a seed pixel.
    stopping_conditions:
      - Reaches the bottom of the grid.
      - Encounters a cell already filled by downward propagation.

  - name: propagate_right
    description: Extends a seed pixel's color rightwards in its row.
    preconditions:
      - Source cell is a seed pixel.
    stopping_conditions:
      - Reaches the right edge of the grid.
      - Encounters a cell that is *below* a seed pixel or is already filled in
        by downward propigation

```


**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Seed Pixels:** Locate all pixels within the input grid that possess non-zero values. These pixels are designated as "seed" pixels.

2.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid. Preserve all original seed pixel values.

3.  **Downward Propagation (Precedence):**
    *   Each seed pixel initiates a downward propagation of its color value within its respective column.
    *   This propagation continues until one of the following conditions is met:
        *   The bottom row of the grid is reached.
        *   An obstruction is hit - a non-zero cell is encountered, including
            other seed pixels and cells filled by another downward propigation.

4.  **Rightward Propagation:**
    *   Each seed pixel initiates a rightward propagation of its color value within its respective row.
    *   This propagation continues until one of the following conditions is met:
        *   The rightmost column of the grid is reached.
        *   An obstruction is hit - if the cell directly below is not zero or if
            the cell has already been filled by a previous downward propigation

5.  **Output:** The output grid, now modified by the propagation rules, represents the final transformed grid.
