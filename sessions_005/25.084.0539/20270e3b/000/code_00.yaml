facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - dimensions: variable (height, width)
  - object: color_blocks
    properties:
      - color:  identified by integer value (e.g., 4, 1, 7)
      - shape: contiguous regions of the same color
    actions:
      - selection:  Certain color blocks are selected/preserved.
      - removal:  Certain color blocks are removed/modified.
      - size_modification: output grid size is related to regions with color 7 or removal of color 7.
    relationships:
      - color_blocks are contained within the grid
      - the selection/removal of color blocks is the primary transformation
