Task: Extract and Count Non-Background Color

Observations:
  - Input grids contain a background color (white, 0) and one foreground color.
  - Output grids are always single rows.
  - The foreground color in the input is the only color present in the output.
  - The number of columns in the output grid equals the total count of foreground pixels in the input grid.

Examples:
  - Example 1:
    - Input: Contains 1 orange (7) pixel.
    - Output: 1x1 grid, filled with orange (7).
  - Example 2:
    - Input: Contains 3 red (2) pixels.
    - Output: 1x3 grid, filled with red (2).
  - Example 3:
    - Input: Contains 4 azure (8) pixels.
    - Output: 1x4 grid, filled with azure (8).
  - Example 4:
    - Input: Contains 2 blue (1) pixels.
    - Output: 1x2 grid, filled with blue (1).

Properties:
  - Objects:
    - Input Grid: Contains pixels.
    - Output Grid: Contains pixels.
    - Foreground Pixels: Pixels in the input grid that are not white (0).
  - Relationships:
    - The color of the Foreground Pixels determines the color of the Output Grid pixels.
    - The count of the Foreground Pixels determines the width (number of columns) of the Output Grid.
    - The height of the Output Grid is always 1.
