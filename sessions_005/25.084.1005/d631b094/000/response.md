## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** The inputs are small square grids (3x3 in all examples).
2.  **Output Structure:** The outputs are single-row grids (1xN).
3.  **Color Usage:** Each input grid contains white pixels (color 0) and pixels of exactly one other color (orange, red, azure, blue). The output grid contains only pixels of that single non-white color found in the input.
4.  **Relationship:** The width of the output grid (N) corresponds directly to the *count* of non-white pixels in the input grid. The color filling the output grid is the same non-white color present in the input grid.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Extract and Count Non-Background Color

Observations:
  - Input grids contain a background color (white, 0) and one foreground color.
  - Output grids are always single rows.
  - The foreground color in the input is the only color present in the output.
  - The number of columns in the output grid equals the total count of foreground pixels in the input grid.

Examples:
  - Example 1:
    - Input: Contains 1 orange (7) pixel.
    - Output: 1x1 grid, filled with orange (7).
  - Example 2:
    - Input: Contains 3 red (2) pixels.
    - Output: 1x3 grid, filled with red (2).
  - Example 3:
    - Input: Contains 4 azure (8) pixels.
    - Output: 1x4 grid, filled with azure (8).
  - Example 4:
    - Input: Contains 2 blue (1) pixels.
    - Output: 1x2 grid, filled with blue (1).

Properties:
  - Objects:
    - Input Grid: Contains pixels.
    - Output Grid: Contains pixels.
    - Foreground Pixels: Pixels in the input grid that are not white (0).
  - Relationships:
    - The color of the Foreground Pixels determines the color of the Output Grid pixels.
    - The count of the Foreground Pixels determines the width (number of columns) of the Output Grid.
    - The height of the Output Grid is always 1.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color 0).
2.  If no non-white pixels are found, the output might be empty or handled differently (though this case isn't shown in the examples). Assume at least one non-white pixel exists based on examples.
3.  Determine the single color C used by these non-white pixels.
4.  Count the total number N of these non-white pixels.
5.  Construct an output grid with dimensions 1 row and N columns.
6.  Fill every cell of the output grid with the color C.
