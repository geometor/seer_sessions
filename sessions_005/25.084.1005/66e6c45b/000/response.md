Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Size**: Both input and output grids are 4x4 in the examples.
2.  **Background Color**: The background color is white (0) in both input and output.
3.  **Input Objects**: The input grids contain four distinct non-white pixels arranged in a 2x2 square. In `train_1`, these are gray (5), magenta (6), azure (8), and green (3). In `train_2`, they are green (3), yellow (4), orange (7), and magenta (6). This 2x2 block appears centered within the 4x4 grid.
4.  **Output Objects**: The output grids contain the same four non-white pixels as the corresponding input, but their positions have changed.
5.  **Transformation**: The four non-white pixels from the input's 2x2 block are moved to the four corners of the output grid.
    *   The pixel at the top-left of the input block moves to the top-left corner (0, 0) of the output.
    *   The pixel at the top-right of the input block moves to the top-right corner (0, 3) of the output.
    *   The pixel at the bottom-left of the input block moves to the bottom-left corner (3, 0) of the output.
    *   The pixel at the bottom-right of the input block moves to the bottom-right corner (3, 3) of the output.
6.  **General Rule**: It seems the task involves identifying a 2x2 block of colored pixels and mapping these pixels to the corners of the output grid while preserving their relative orientation (top-left to top-left, top-right to top-right, etc.). The rest of the output grid is filled with the background color.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the dimensions (height `H`, width `W`) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions (`H` x `W`), filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Search the input grid for a 2x2 block where all four pixels have non-white colors (values > 0). Let the coordinates of the top-left pixel of this block be (`r`, `c`).
4.  Identify the colors of the four pixels within this block in the input grid:
    *   `top_left_color` = color at (`r`, `c`)
    *   `top_right_color` = color at (`r`, `c`+1)
    *   `bottom_left_color` = color at (`r`+1, `c`)
    *   `bottom_right_color` = color at (`r`+1, `c`+1)
5.  Place these identified colors into the corners of the output grid:
    *   Set the pixel at (0, 0) in the output grid to `top_left_color`.
    *   Set the pixel at (0, `W`-1) in the output grid to `top_right_color`.
    *   Set the pixel at (`H`-1, 0) in the output grid to `bottom_left_color`.
    *   Set the pixel at (`H`-1, `W`-1) in the output grid to `bottom_right_color`.
6.  Return the completed output grid.
