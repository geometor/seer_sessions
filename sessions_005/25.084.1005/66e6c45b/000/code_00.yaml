task_description: Map the four pixels of a 2x2 colored block onto the four corners of the output grid.

definitions:
  - object: block
    description: A contiguous 2x2 area where all four pixels are non-white (color != 0).
  - property: grid_dimensions
    description: Height and width of the input and output grids.
  - property: background_color
    description: The color used for pixels that are not part of the main objects (typically white/0).
  - property: corner_pixels
    description: The four pixels located at (0, 0), (0, width-1), (height-1, 0), and (height-1, width-1).

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    description: Pixels within the identified 2x2 input block are mapped to specific corner positions in the output grid.
    details:
      - input_pixel: Top-left of the block
        output_pixel: Top-left corner (0, 0)
      - input_pixel: Top-right of the block
        output_pixel: Top-right corner (0, width-1)
      - input_pixel: Bottom-left of the block
        output_pixel: Bottom-left corner (height-1, 0)
      - input_pixel: Bottom-right of the block
        output_pixel: Bottom-right corner (height-1, width-1)

actions:
  - action: find_block
    description: Locate the 2x2 block of non-white pixels within the input grid.
    assumptions: Assumes exactly one such block exists.
  - action: create_output_grid
    description: Generate a new grid with the same dimensions as the input, initially filled with the background color.
  - action: place_pixels
    description: Place the identified pixels from the input block into the corresponding corners of the output grid.
