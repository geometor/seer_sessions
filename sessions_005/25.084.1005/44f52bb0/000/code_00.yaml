task_type: transformation
input_domain:
  grid_size: 3x3
  distinct_colors: [0, 2] # white, red
  color_distribution: variable arrangement of red pixels on a white background
output_domain:
  type: single_integer
  values: [1, 7]
transformation_characteristics:
  input_dimensionality: 2D grid (3x3)
  output_dimensionality: 0D (single value)
  operation_type: pattern analysis, symmetry detection
key_observations:
  - The output (1 or 7) depends on the symmetry of the input grid pattern.
  - Symmetry is checked across vertical, horizontal, main diagonal, and anti-diagonal axes.
  - Presence of *any* symmetry results in output 1.
  - Absence of *any* symmetry results in output 7.
involved_objects:
  - type: grid
    attributes:
      - size: 3x3
      - pixels: cells with values 0 (white) or 2 (red)
  - type: pattern
    description: The arrangement of red pixels within the grid.
    properties:
      - symmetry: checked across vertical, horizontal, main, and anti-diagonals.
relationship: The symmetry property of the 'pattern' object within the 'grid' object determines the output value.
