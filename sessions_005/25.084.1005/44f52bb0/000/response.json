            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input:** The inputs are always 3x3 grids. The grids contain only two colors: white (0) and red (2).\n2.  **Output:** The outputs are always a single digit, specifically either 1 or 7.\n3.  **Relationship:** The specific arrangement of the red pixels within the 3x3 input grid determines whether the output is 1 or 7. The transformation doesn't seem related to the count of red pixels or simple connectivity rules alone, but rather to a global property of the pattern.\n\n**Observations and Analysis:**\n\n*   **Fixed Size:** Both input and output formats are consistent across examples (3x3 grid in, single digit out).\n*   **Color Palette:** Limited to white (0) and red (2).\n*   **Output Values:** Binary choice between 1 and 7.\n*   **Pattern Analysis:**\n    *   Examples 1, 5, and 6, which output '1', exhibit clear symmetry.\n        *   Example 1: Vertical symmetry.\n        *   Example 5: Vertical and horizontal symmetry.\n        *   Example 6: Vertical, horizontal, main diagonal, and anti-diagonal symmetry.\n    *   Examples 2, 3, and 4, which output '7', lack any obvious axis or diagonal symmetry.\n*   **Hypothesis:** The transformation rule appears to be based on checking the symmetry of the input grid pattern. If the pattern of red and white pixels has *any* form of symmetry (vertical, horizontal, diagonal), the output is 1. Otherwise, if the pattern is asymmetric, the output is 7.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
