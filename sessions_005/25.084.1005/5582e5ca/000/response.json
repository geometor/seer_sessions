There doesn't appear to be a consistent spatial pattern within the inputs across examples.\n3.  **Output Content:** The output grids are uniformly filled with a single color.\n4.  **Transformation Clue:** The color used to fill the output grid appears to be related to the colors present in the input grid. Specifically, the output color seems to be the color that appears most often in the corresponding input grid.\n    *   Example 1: Input has three '9's (maroon), two '8's (azure), two '1's (blue), one '6' (magenta), one '4' (yellow). Output is all '9' (maroon).\n    *   Example 2: Input has three '4's (yellow), two '6's (magenta), two '3's (green), one '8' (azure), one '0' (white). Output is all '4' (yellow).\n    *   Example 3: Input has three '6's (magenta), two '4's (yellow), two '8's (azure), one '9' (maroon), one '1' (blue). Output is all '6' (magenta).\n5.  **Underlying Logic:** The task requires identifying the most frequent color (mode) in the input grid and then creating an output grid of the same dimensions filled entirely with that modal color.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
