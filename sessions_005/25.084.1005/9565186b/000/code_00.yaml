task_type: conditional_color_replacement
grid_properties:
  - size_preservation: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
components:
  - pixels: Cells with color values 1 through 8 observed in inputs.
  - stable_color: The single color from the input grid that appears most frequently.
  - replacement_color: gray (5), used for non-stable pixels.
relationships:
  - frequency_rule: The color with the highest count in the input grid becomes the 'stable_color'.
actions:
  - count_pixel_colors: Determine the frequency of each color in the input grid.
  - identify_stable_color: Select the color with the maximum frequency count.
  - generate_output_grid: Create a new grid where:
      - Pixels matching the 'stable_color' retain their color.
      - All other pixels are changed to the 'replacement_color' (gray, 5).
assumptions:
  - unique_maximum_frequency: It is assumed that there will always be a single color with the highest frequency. The behavior for ties is not defined by the examples.
  - no_background_involvement: Color 0 (white) is not present and does not participate in the transformation.
