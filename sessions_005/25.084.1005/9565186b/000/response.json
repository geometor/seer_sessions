The output grids use the color gray (5) and one other color that was present in the input.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing some pixels to gray (5) while keeping others unchanged. It appears selective based on the original color.\n4.  **Color Preservation:** In each example, exactly one of the input colors is preserved in the output grid. All pixels of that specific color remain unchanged.\n    *   Example 1: Red (2) is preserved.\n    *   Example 2: Blue (1) is preserved.\n    *   Example 3: Yellow (4) is preserved.\n    *   Example 4: Red (2) is preserved.\n5.  **Color Replacement:** All pixels whose color is *not* the preserved color are changed to gray (5).\n6.  **Identifying the Preserved Color:** Let's examine the frequency of colors in the input grids:\n    *   Example 1: red (7), azure (2). Preserved: red (highest count).\n    *   Example 2: blue (4), azure (2), red (2), green (1). Preserved: blue (highest count).\n    *   Example 3: yellow (3), blue (2), green (2), azure (2). Preserved: yellow (highest count).\n    *   Example 4: red (5), azure (3), blue (1). Preserved: red (highest count).\n    The color that is preserved in the output is consistently the color that appears most frequently in the input grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
