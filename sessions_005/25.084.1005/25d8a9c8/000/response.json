The input grids contain various colors, while the output grids consist solely of white (0) and gray (5) pixels. The transformation appears to operate on a row-by-row basis. Each row in the input grid corresponds to a row in the output grid, and the content of the output row depends on the colors present in the input row. Specifically, if an input row contains pixels of only one distinct color, the corresponding output row becomes entirely gray (5). If an input row contains pixels of two or more distinct colors, the corresponding output row becomes entirely white (0).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
