## train_1

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Size**: Both examples use 3x3 grids for input and output. The grid dimensions remain constant during the transformation.
2.  **Colors**: A variety of colors are present (Gray, Red, Blue, White in example 1; Green, Azure, Orange, Gray, White in example 2). All colors present in the input grid are also present in the output grid, and vice versa. No new colors are introduced, and no colors are removed (except potentially White, which acts as a background). The counts of each non-white color remain the same between input and output.
3.  **Content**: The non-white pixels in the input seem to form distinct small objects or individual pixels.
4.  **Transformation**: Comparing the input and output grids, the arrangement of the colored pixels is significantly different. In both examples, the output grid appears to be the input grid rotated by 180 degrees around its center.
    *   Example 1 Input:
        
```
        5 5 2
        1 0 0
        0 0 0
        ```

        Rotated 180 degrees:
        
```
        0 0 0
        0 0 1
        2 5 5
        ```

        This matches Example 1 Output.
    *   Example 2 Input:
        
```
        3 3 8
        3 7 0
        5 0 0
        ```

        Rotated 180 degrees:
        
```
        0 0 5
        0 7 3
        8 3 3
        ```

        This matches Example 2 Output.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: transformation
grid_properties:
  - type: input_grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors.
    attributes:
      height: 3
      width: 3
      colors_present: [Gray, Red, Blue, White] in example 1; [Green, Azure, Orange, Gray, White] in example 2.
  - type: output_grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels resulting from transforming the input grid.
    attributes:
      height: 3
      width: 3
      colors_present: Same as corresponding input grid.
transformation:
  type: geometric
  action: rotation
  details:
    - The entire input grid is rotated.
    - The angle of rotation is 180 degrees.
    - The center of rotation is the center of the grid.
    - All pixels, including the background (White) pixels, participate in the rotation.
relationship:
  - The output grid is a 180-degree rotation of the input grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Take the input grid.
2.  Rotate the entire grid by 180 degrees around its center point.
3.  The resulting grid is the output.
