```python
"""
Creates a checkerboard pattern from two input rows of solid colors.

1. Identify the two distinct colors present in the input grid. Let C1 be the 
   color of the first row and C2 be the color of the second row.
2. Determine the width (W) of the input grid.
3. Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid 
   (2 rows, W columns).
4. Fill the first row (row index 0) of the output grid: For each column 
   index `j` from 0 to W-1, set the pixel color to C1 if `j` is even, and 
   to C2 if `j` is odd.
5. Fill the second row (row index 1) of the output grid: For each column 
   index `j` from 0 to W-1, set the pixel color to C2 if `j` is even, and 
   to C1 if `j` is odd.
6. Return the generated output grid.
