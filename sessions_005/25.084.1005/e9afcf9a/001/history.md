## train_1

**input:**
```
4 4 4 4 4 4
8 8 8 8 8 8
```


**output:**
```
4 8 4 8 4 8
8 4 8 4 8 4
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9
```


**output:**
```
3 9 3 9 3 9
9 3 9 3 9 3
```

Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure**: The input grids consistently consist of exactly two rows. Each row is composed of a single, repeating color. The two rows always have different colors. The width of the input grids is 6 columns in both examples.
2.  **Output Structure**: The output grids also have exactly two rows and the same width as the corresponding input grids (6 columns).
3.  **Color Preservation**: The output grids use only the two colors present in the input grids. No new colors are introduced, and no input colors are discarded.
4.  **Transformation Pattern**: The output arranges the two input colors into a checkerboard or alternating pattern.
    *   The first row of the output starts with the color from the first row of the input and alternates with the color from the second row of the input.
    *   The second row of the output starts with the color from the second row of the input and alternates with the color from the first row of the input.
5.  **Dimensionality**: The height (2 rows) and width (6 columns) of the grid remain unchanged between input and output.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      height: 2
      width: W (variable, 6 in examples)
      pixels:
        - object: row_1
          color: C1 (uniform)
          location: row index 0
        - object: row_2
          color: C2 (uniform)
          location: row index 1
      constraints:
        - C1 != C2

Output:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      height: 2
      width: W (same as input)
      pixels:
        - derived_from: [row_1, row_2]
          pattern: checkerboard
          colors_used: [C1, C2]
      constraints:
        - Output grid dimensions match input grid dimensions.
        - Output[0, j] = C1 if j is even, C2 if j is odd
        - Output[1, j] = C2 if j is even, C1 if j is odd
          (where j is the column index, starting from 0)

Relationships:
  - The colors C1 and C2 in the output directly correspond to the colors of the first and second rows of the input, respectively.
  - The arrangement of pixels in the output depends on their row and column index (parity) and the original input colors.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the two distinct colors present in the input grid. Let C1 be the color of the first row and C2 be the color of the second row.
2.  Determine the width (W) of the input grid.
3.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid (2 rows, W columns).
4.  Fill the first row (row index 0) of the output grid: For each column index `j` from 0 to W-1, set the pixel color to C1 if `j` is even, and to C2 if `j` is odd.
5.  Fill the second row (row index 1) of the output grid: For each column index `j` from 0 to W-1, set the pixel color to C2 if `j` is even, and to C1 if `j` is odd.
6.  Return the generated output grid.
