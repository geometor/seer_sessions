Each row is composed of a single, repeating color. The two rows always have different colors. The width of the input grids is 6 columns in both examples.\n2.  **Output Structure**: The output grids also have exactly two rows and the same width as the corresponding input grids (6 columns).\n3.  **Color Preservation**: The output grids use only the two colors present in the input grids. No new colors are introduced, and no input colors are discarded.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern**: The output arranges the two input colors into a checkerboard or alternating pattern.\n    *   The first row of the output starts with the color from the first row of the input and alternates with the color from the second row of the input.\n    *   The second row of the output starts with the color from the second row of the input and alternates with the color from the first row of the input.\n5.  **Dimensionality**: The height (2 rows) and width (6 columns) of the grid remain unchanged between input and output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
