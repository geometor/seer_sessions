task_context:
  grid_size: Fixed 3x3 in examples, but the rule seems generalizable to other sizes.
  colors_present: white (0) background, various non-white colors (red, orange, azure, magenta, yellow, green in examples).
  input_elements: Non-contiguous pixels of various colors scattered on a white background.

transformation_rules:
  - scope: Grid column
  - direction: Vertical (top-to-bottom)
  - operation: Color propagation/filling
  - condition: Propagate color downwards onto white pixels.
  - details:
      - Process each column independently.
      - Iterate through rows within a column from top (row 0) to bottom.
      - Maintain a 'current_paint_color' variable for the column, initialized to white (0).
      - If a pixel is non-white, update the 'current_paint_color' to this pixel's color.
      - If a pixel is white (0), change its color to the 'current_paint_color'.
      - Non-white pixels retain their original color.

output_characteristics:
  - grid_size: Same as input.
  - color_changes: White pixels below non-white pixels in the same column adopt the color of the nearest non-white pixel above them.
  - preserved_elements: Original positions and colors of non-white pixels are preserved. White pixels not below any non-white pixel in their column remain white.
