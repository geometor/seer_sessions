Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 3x3 grids.
2.  **Colors:** The inputs contain various colors (red, orange, azure, magenta, yellow, green) on a white background (0).
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve colors "dripping" or "falling" downwards within each column.
4.  **Column Independence:** The changes in one column do not appear to affect other columns.
5.  **Color Propagation:** When a non-white pixel is encountered in a column (reading from top to bottom), its color seems to be applied to all subsequent white pixels below it in that same column.
6.  **Overwriting:** Only white pixels are changed; existing non-white pixels retain their original color and also act as the source for coloring white pixels below them.
7.  **Top-Down Processing:** The process happens vertically, from the top row towards the bottom row. The color seen higher up in a column dictates the color fill below it.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_size: Fixed 3x3 in examples, but the rule seems generalizable to other sizes.
  colors_present: white (0) background, various non-white colors (red, orange, azure, magenta, yellow, green in examples).
  input_elements: Non-contiguous pixels of various colors scattered on a white background.

transformation_rules:
  - scope: Grid column
  - direction: Vertical (top-to-bottom)
  - operation: Color propagation/filling
  - condition: Propagate color downwards onto white pixels.
  - details:
      - Process each column independently.
      - Iterate through rows within a column from top (row 0) to bottom.
      - Maintain a 'current_paint_color' variable for the column, initialized to white (0).
      - If a pixel is non-white, update the 'current_paint_color' to this pixel's color.
      - If a pixel is white (0), change its color to the 'current_paint_color'.
      - Non-white pixels retain their original color.

output_characteristics:
  - grid_size: Same as input.
  - color_changes: White pixels below non-white pixels in the same column adopt the color of the nearest non-white pixel above them.
  - preserved_elements: Original positions and colors of non-white pixels are preserved. White pixels not below any non-white pixel in their column remain white.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Determine the number of rows and columns in the grid.
3.  Iterate through each column index from left to right (e.g., index `c` from 0 to width-1).
4.  For the current column `c`, initialize a variable `current_paint_color` to white (0).
5.  Iterate through each row index from top to bottom (e.g., index `r` from 0 to height-1).
6.  Examine the pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid.
7.  If the pixel's color is not white (not 0), update `current_paint_color` to this pixel's color.
8.  If the pixel's color is white (0) and `current_paint_color` is not white (not 0), change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to `current_paint_color`.
9.  After iterating through all rows in the current column, move to the next column.
10. Once all columns have been processed, the modified output grid is the final result.
