# Describe facts observed in the examples
# focusing on objects, properties, actions, relationships

# Grid properties
grid_dimensions_input:
  width: 3
  height: 3
grid_dimensions_output:
  width: 3
  height: 3
colors_present: [white, red, blue] # 0, 2, 1
background_color: white # 0

# Object Identification (implicit)
# Objects are contiguous areas of non-background color.
# Examples show single objects, but the rule applies grid-wide.

# Actions / Transformations
- action: shift_grid_content
  direction: down
  amount: 1 row
- action: fill_row
  row_index: 0 # Top row
  fill_color: background_color # white (0)

# Relationships
- The content of output row `i` (where `i > 0`) corresponds to the content of input row `i-1`.
- The content of output row `0` is always the background color, regardless of input content.
- The content of the last input row does not appear in the output.
