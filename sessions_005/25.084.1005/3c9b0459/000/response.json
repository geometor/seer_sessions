            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task.\n\n**Perception of the elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Size:** All input and output grids are consistently 3x3.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The colors used in the output grid are exactly the same as the colors used in the input grid for each example. No colors are added or removed.\n3.  **Transformation:** The positions of the colors within the grid change from input to output. Comparing the input and output grids, the pattern appears to be a geometric transformation.\n4.  **Consistency:** The transformation seems consistent across all four training examples. Let's test the hypothesis of a 180-degree rotation:\n    *   **Train 1:** Rotating the input 180 degrees places the bottom-right pixel (5) at the top-left, the top-left pixel (8) at the bottom-right, and the center pixel (5) remains in the center. This matches the output.\n    *   **Train 2:** Rotating the input 180 degrees places the bottom-right pixel (2) at the top-left, the top-left pixel (9) at the bottom-right, and the center pixel (4) remains in the center. This matches the output.\n    *   **Train 3:** Rotating the input 180 degrees places the bottom-right pixel (3) at the top-left, the top-left pixel (3) at the bottom-right, and the center pixel (9) remains in the center. This matches the output.\n    *   **Train 4:** Rotating the input 180 degrees places the bottom-right pixel (1) at the top-left, the top-left pixel (2) at the bottom-right, and the center pixel (1) remains in the center. This matches the output.\n\nThe hypothesis holds for all examples. The transformation is a 180-degree rotation of the entire grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
