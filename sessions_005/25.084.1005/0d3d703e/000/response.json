            "text": "Okay, let's break down the perception of this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The inputs and outputs are grids of the same size (3x3 in all examples). Within each example, all rows of the input grid are identical, and all rows of the output grid are identical.\n2.  **Transformation Type:** The transformation appears to be a simple, position-independent mapping of pixel colors. Each color value in the input grid is consistently replaced by a specific, different color value in the output grid. The location of the pixel does not affect the transformation.\n3.  **Color Mapping:** By comparing the input and output values across the examples, we can deduce the following specific color transformations:\n    *   Gray (5) maps to Blue (1)\n    *   Azure (8) maps to Maroon (9)\n    *   Magenta (6) maps to Red (2)\n    *   Red (2) maps to Magenta (6)\n    *   Green (3) maps to Yellow (4)\n    *   Maroon (9) maps to Azure (8)\n    *   Yellow (4) maps to Green (3)\n    *   Blue (1) maps to Gray (5)\n4.  **Mapping Pattern:** The mapping involves pairs of colors being swapped:\n    *   (Gray <-> Blue) or (5 <-> 1)\n    *   (Azure <-> Maroon) or (8 <-> 9)\n    *   (Magenta <-> Red) or (6 <-> 2)\n    *   (Green <-> Yellow) or (3 <-> 4)\n5.  **Unseen Colors:** The colors White (0) and Orange (7) do not appear in the training examples. Based on the consistent pixel-wise mapping, the most straightforward assumption is that these colors, if encountered, would remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
