Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** Each input is a 3x3 grid. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit representing a color (0-9). It seems like the grids always have a black background (color 0) and a single other color.\n*   **Output:** The output is a smaller grid (either 1x1, 1x2, or 2x2) containing only the non-black color from the input grid. The number of times that non black color appears is equal to the number of that color in one row or colum of the grid, or the total count of pixels.\n*   **Transformation:** It appears that the transformation isolates the non-black color and constructs a new grid. The dimensions of this new grid are determined by the total amount of the isolated color.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
