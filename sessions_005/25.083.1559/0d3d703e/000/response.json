Each grid contains single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The transformation seems to operate on each number individually, consistently changing it to another specific number. The spatial arrangement of the numbers within the grid appears irrelevant, as the transformation is identical across all rows. This suggests a one-to-one mapping or substitution rule between input and output numbers.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
