1.  **Inspect the input grid:** Examine the colors of all pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Count occurrences of each color:** Determine the number of times each color appears in the input grid.
3.  **Identify the most frequent color:**  Select the color that appears most often within the input grid. If multiple colors have max count, choose any of them.
4.  **Create the output grid:**
    *   Create a new grid with the same dimensions (width and height) as the input grid.
    *   Fill every cell of the output grid with the most frequent color identified in the previous step.
