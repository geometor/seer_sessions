## train_1

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object documentation, and a natural language program description of the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The core elements are two grids: an input grid and a corresponding output grid. Both grids appear to have the same dimensions within a single example, but dimensions can differ between examples.
*   **Colors/Values:** Each cell in the grid has a single numerical value, representing a color.
*   **Transformation:** There's a clear transformation happening, but it's not immediately obvious. It *seems* like the input grid is somehow rotated or mirrored and the digits are potentially remapped. The dimensions remain the same.
* **Possible Rotation/Reflection**: It strongly looks like the input is rotated counter clockwise by 90 degrees.
* **Consistent Digit Changes**: A given digit in input, corresponds to a particular digit in output.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output data are represented as 2D grids.
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - cells: contain integer values (0-9) representing colors

  - type: transformation
    description: A rule-based change from the input grid to the output grid.
    properties:
      - rotation: Input grid appears to be rotated counter-clockwise by 90 degrees.
      - value_mapping: Input cell values are consistently mapped to output cell values.

observations:
  - example_1:
      input_dimensions: 2x3
      output_dimensions: 3x2
      value_mapping:
        5 -> 2
        2 -> 5
        1 -> 0
        0 -> 0
  - example_2:
    input_dimensions: 2x3
    output_dimensions: 3x2
    value_mapping:
      3 -> 8
      3 -> 3
      8 -> 3
      7 -> 7
      5 -> 0
      0 -> 0
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Rotate:** Rotate the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise. This means the top row of the input becomes the rightmost column of the output, and so on. The dimensions of the output grid swap places from input (rows become cols, cols become rows).

2. **Remap Values**: After rotating, remap the values in each grid from input to output, according the value mapping in the observation above. If the input is 5, the output is 2 or 0.
   *   In example 1: `1` becomes `0`, `0` stays `0`, `2` becomes `5`, and 5 becomes 2.
   *   In example 2: `3` becomes `8`, `7` becomes `7`, `5` becomes 0, `0` stays `0`, and `8` stays 3.

In general:
   *  0 -> 0
   *  1 -> 0
   *  2 -> 5
   *  3 -> 8 or 3
   *  5 -> 2 or 0
   *  7 -> 7
   *  8 -> 3
