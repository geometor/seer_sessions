facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids always have the same dimensions (3x3 in all provided examples).  The transformation preserves the dimensions.
  - observation: |
      The color counts for each color are identical between the input and output grids. The transformation is a permutation of the elements, not a change in their values.
  - observation: |
      The transformation involves a column-to-row transposition. The j-th column of the input grid becomes the j-th row of the output grid.
  - observation: |
     The element at input[i, j] moves to output[j, (number_of_columns - 1) - i].
