facts:
  - observation: Input grids are 3x3.
  - observation: Output grids vary in dimension.
  - observation: Zero-valued pixels represent the background (white).
  - observation: Non-zero pixels represent colored objects.
  - observation: The output grid consists only of the non-zero colored pixels from the input.
  - observation: the input grid has non-zero elements in up to three rows and up to three columns.
  - object: Non-zero pixels
    properties:
      - color: Defined by the digit (1-9)
      - role: Primary objects of interest
    actions:
      - are extracted: from the input grid
      - are concatenated: placed together in sequence
  - object: Zero-valued pixels
    properties:
      - color: White (0)
      - role: Background, ignored in the transformation
    actions:
      - discarded: Not included in the output
  - relationship: The count of non-zero elements determines the number of values in the output
  - relationship: the count of input columns with non-zero elements determines the output's width, the count of input rows with non-zero elements determines output height.
