The output grid's dimensions and the number of non-zero elements appear to be related. There's a strong indication of objectness, with non-zero pixels acting as objects against a background of zero-valued pixels.  The spatial arrangement of the non-zero pixels in the input seems to dictate the dimensions of the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
