The input and output sequences have the same length. There appears to be a reordering of the integers, not a mathematical operation (like addition or subtraction) applied to them. The transformation seems to involve a sorting or swapping of elements based on their values. It's not a simple reversal. There is some combination of sorting and maintaining position.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

Split the input sequence into two sub-sequences:\n    *   Sub-sequence A: Contains elements that are in even positions and order based on value ascending.\n    *   Sub-sequence B: Contains the elements in odd position, maintains original order.\n2.  Merge the two sub-sequences.\n    *   Interleave, starting with sub-sequence B\n\n**Alternative Interpretation (and Preferred - More Accurate with only two examples):**\n\n1. Split the sequence in two based on value:\n  *  Create 2 new sub-sequences.\n  *  Sub-sequence A has all elements less than the next element, sorted ascending.\n  *  Sub-sequence B has all elements greater than or equal to the next element, maintain original order.\n2. Concatenate Sub-sequence B and Sub-sequence A.\n\n**Elaboration on choosing between the two:**\n\nI believe after examining more closely, the preferred program better handles `train_2`.\nThe first program describes a sequence of `[3,6,8,4,2]` while the second program\ndescribes the observed output of `[3,4,6,8,2]`.\n"
