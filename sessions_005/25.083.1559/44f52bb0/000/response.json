The outputs are single-digit integers. The core challenge seems to be relating the arrangement or count of red pixels in the input grid to a specific output number. There's no immediately obvious geometric transformation (rotation, reflection, etc.) or simple counting mechanism. The relationship appears more abstract or rule-based.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

This line can be vertical or diagonal. If a three-pixel line is present, the output is 1.\n\n3. **Pattern Recognition - L-Shape:** If there is no line formed by three pixels, check if the red pixels form a group with only three pixels forming an \"L\" shape. The \"L\" can be rotated in any of the four primary orientations.  If an L-shape of three red pixels is present, the output is 7.\n\n4. **Default Output:** If neither a line of three pixels nor an L-shape of three pixels is found, the behavior is unknown, based on the current example data. There aren't enough examples for other cases.\n"
