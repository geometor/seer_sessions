The output pattern seems to \"grow\" or be \"generated\" *around* the location that would correspond to the red pixel's input location.\n*   **Output Colors:** The output uses colors other than '2' (red) and '0' (white): '3' (green), '6' (magenta), '7' (orange), and '8' (azure). There's no immediately obvious pattern in which *specific* colors appear.\n*   **Consistent Size:** The input and output grids always have the same dimensions.\n*   The transformation seems to be some sort of a pattern that expands out from where a 2 is in the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
