facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: rows x columns
      - elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    actions:
      - iterated: Each element is accessed.
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2 * input_rows x 2 * input_columns
      - elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    actions:
      - initialized: Created with dimensions double the input.
      - populated: Elements from input_grid are duplicated and placed.
  - action: duplication
    description: Each element in the input grid is duplicated to form a 2x2 block in the output grid.
    properties:
      - input: single element (pixel) from input_grid.
      - output: 2x2 block of the same element in output_grid.
  - observation: transformation_rule
    description: The input grid's pixels are expanded into 2x2 blocks in the output grid.
    details: >
      The output grid has dimensions exactly twice that of the input grid, and contains the original
      pixels repeated to make small squares.
