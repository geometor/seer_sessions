Here's my breakdown of the input-output examples:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The input is a 5x5 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid.\n*   The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.\n*   The value 0 (white) seems to act as a background or filler.\n*   Non-zero values appear to be extracted and arranged in a specific way to form the output grid.\n*   The central 3x3 section of input is important.\n*   The corners of the 5x5 input are in the corners of the 3x3 output, and so is the very center value.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
