            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a single example, and as expected, it doesn't generalize perfectly to the second example. The core idea of shifting values along a diagonal is partially correct, but the implementation needs refinement. The primary issue is that the initial code *only* moves the values on the main diagonal (where row index equals column index). The second example reveals a more complex diagonal-related transformation that the current code doesn't capture. My strategy is to analyze the differences between the input, expected output, and transformed output for both examples. This will help pinpoint the exact nature of the diagonal shift and any additional rules.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Comparison:** I'll use python to compare the input, expected output, and actual output for both examples. This will highlight exactly which pixels changed and how, revealing patterns not yet captured.\n2.  **Object Identification:** I need to conceptualize the grids and changes in terms of \"objects\". The examples so far suggest diagonals, but how many, and of what properties?\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the deeper analysis, I'll reformulate the natural language program to be more precise and comprehensive.\n4.  **Prepare for Future Code:** The YAML fact block will capture the observed rules, preparing a structured input for the next coding stage.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Analysis (using code execution):**\n\nI'll use numpy for efficient array comparisons. I'll analyze the coordinates of the changes that were expected, and not correct and the coordinates of changes that were not correct.\n\n"

The set of diagonals to shift includes every other diagonal that runs parallel to the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right). Consider the main diagonal as 'diagonal 0', and number subsequent parallel diagonals above and below, increasing outwards. The rule shifts elements along only the *odd-numbered* diagonals. The shift is downwards and to the right, and it *wraps* around the grid boundaries. For each odd-numbered diagonal, each cell's value moves to the cell below and to the right. If this move takes it off the bottom of the grid, wrap to the top row; if the move takes it off the right side, wrap it to the left-most column.\n\nExample breakdown for the second example:\n\nThe input grid is 6x6.\n"
