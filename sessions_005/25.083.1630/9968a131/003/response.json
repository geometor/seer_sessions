The set of diagonals to shift includes every other diagonal that runs parallel to the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right). Consider the main diagonal as 'diagonal 0', and number subsequent parallel diagonals above and below, increasing outwards. The rule shifts elements along only the *odd-numbered* diagonals. The shift is downwards and to the right, and it *wraps* around the grid boundaries. For each odd-numbered diagonal, each cell's value moves to the cell below and to the right. If this move takes it off the bottom of the grid, wrap to the top row; if the move takes it off the right side, wrap it to the left-most column.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_diagonal(input_grid, offset):\n    \"\"\"\n    Retrieves the elements along a specified diagonal, with wrapping.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: The 2D numpy array.\n        offset: The offset from the main diagonal. 0 is the main diagonal,\n                positive values are diagonals below, negative are above.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    diagonal = []\n    row_indices = []\n    col_indices = []\n    for i in range(max(rows, cols)):\n        row = (i - max(0, offset)) % rows\n        col = (i + max(0, -offset)) % cols\n        if row < rows and col < cols:\n            diagonal.append(input_grid[row, col])\n            row_indices.append(row)\n            col_indices.append(col)\n    return diagonal, row_indices, col_indices\n\ndef shift_diagonal(diagonal):\n    \"\"\"Shifts a list (representing a diagonal) by one position to the right, wrapping.\"\"\"\n    return [diagonal[-1]] + diagonal[:-1]\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through all possible diagonal offsets\n    for offset in range(-rows + 1, cols):\n        # Only shift odd-numbered diagonals\n        if offset % 2 != 0:\n            # Get the original diagonal and its indices\n            original_diagonal, row_indices, col_indices = get_diagonal(input_grid, offset)\n            \n            # Shift the diagonal values\n            shifted_diagonal = shift_diagonal(original_diagonal)\n\n            # Update the output_grid with the shifted values\n            for i in range(len(row_indices)):\n                output_grid[row_indices[i], col_indices[i]] = shifted_diagonal[i]\n                \n    return output_grid\n```"
