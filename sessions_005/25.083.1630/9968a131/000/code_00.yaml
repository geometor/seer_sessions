objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: integer
      columns: integer
      cells: integer (0-9) representing colors
    relationships:
      - input_grid: relates to output_grid via transformation rule
      - output_grid: result of applying transformation to input_grid
  - type: color
    properties:
       value: 0 to 9

actions:
  - name: transform
    description: Changes specific cell colors based on a rule.
    preconditions:
      - input_grid: exists
    postconditions:
      - output_grid: created/modified
    parameters: rule, coordinates, and value

relationships:
  - input_output:  The input grid and output grid are linked by a transformation
                  where certain cell values (colors) are changed based on their
                  position and original value.
  - color_change: Some colors are changed to different colors.
  - color_preservation: Some colors remain the same.
