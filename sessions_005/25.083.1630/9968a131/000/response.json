Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.\n*   The input and output grids have the same dimensions.\n*   The transformation seems to involve a specific pattern of color (digit) changes, not a simple global replacement.\n*   The positions of the changed colors are significant; it's not just a color swap.\n*   There's a sense of mirroring or reflection, but it is not perfect.\n*   Some colors stay the same, others are permuted.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
