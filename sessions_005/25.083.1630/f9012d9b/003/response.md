"""
1.  **Analyze Input:** Examine the input grid, noting the colors, their counts, and the grid's dimensions.
2.  **Identify Repeating Rows/Cols:** Determine the number of consecutively repeating rows and columns.
3.  **Check for Simple Pattern**: If the input grid has fully repeating rows, find the repeating row.
    If the input grid has fully repeating columns, find the repeating column.
4. **Construct Minimal Output**:
    If simple pattern is present and there is no smaller distinct output pattern, the minimal representation will consist of the first row or column repeated.
5.  **Return:** Create an output grid containing this sub-grid.
