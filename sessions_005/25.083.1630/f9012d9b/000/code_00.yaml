facts:
  - observation: Input grids are rectangular and of varying dimensions.
  - observation: Output grids are rectangular and smaller than input grids.
  - observation: All colors in the output grid are present in the input grid.
  - observation: The input often contains repeated color patterns/stripes/other.
  - hypothesis: The transformation might involve identifying and extracting a recurring sub-pattern.
  - hypothesis: In train_2, 1 is central to the repeating stripe.
  - hypothesis: In train_3, 5 is the largest area of a single color (excluding borders).
  - hypothesis: The output might represent the most prominent or centrally located color/pattern.
  - observation: There are horizontal and vertical elements and also possible diagonals.
  - question: How is the size and position of the output grid determined?
