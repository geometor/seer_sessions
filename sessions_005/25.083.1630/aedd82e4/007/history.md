1.  **Change the Bottom-Right Red:** Scan the input grid to locate *the* bottom-most and then right-most red (2) pixel. If a red pixel is found at those coordinates, change its color to blue (1).

2.  **Change the Next Red, By Priority:** If, after performing step 1, any other red pixels are found, select *one* to change to blue based on this order of priority:
    - If there were more than one pixel that qualified as bottom-most and
      right-most, change the left-most one among them.
    - Otherwise, reading the grid from bottom to top, and right to left within each
      row, change the next encountered red pixel.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the results, error analysis, and updated natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code performs reasonably well, correctly transforming examples 2 and 3. However, it fails on examples 1 and 4. The primary issue seems to be handling multiple red pixels in the bottom-most row and selecting the *leftmost* in that set. The secondary problem is the order of processing. It appears to be correctly identifying, and prioritizing, however example 4 shows the second pixel replacement is misplaced.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Bottom-Most Red Logic:** Specifically address the case where multiple red pixels exist in the bottom-most row. Ensure the *leftmost* of these is selected.
2.  **Re-evaluate Priority Order:** Example 4 indicates that the pixel above should have been transformed and not the pixel to the side. We need to ensure correct selection of the 2nd pixel after step one is complete.
3. Document, using YAML, the objects, properties and actions.

**Metrics and Error Analysis:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Error:** The bottom-right red pixel is incorrectly changed to blue (1).
        The next choice is incorrect also.
    *   **Root Cause:** The code identifies `(4, 3)` which is the most bottom, then
        the most right, correctly. However, the 2nd replacement should not be
        the most bottom-right, but the next using the correct priority.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Success:** Correct transformation.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Success:** Correct transformation.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   **Error:** The code changes two pixels, but changes `(1,2)` before `(2,0)`.
    *   **Root Cause**: The secondary selection is incorrect.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**

    description: Transforms the grid by changing two red pixel's color based on
                 defined priority rules.
    input: grid
    output: new_grid
```


**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Change the Bottom-Right Red:**
    *   Scan the input grid to locate the *bottom-most* red (2) pixels.
    *   If multiple pixels share the bottom-most row, select the *left-most* one among these.
    *   Change the color of the selected pixel to blue (1).

2. **Change Another Red, By Priority:**
   * Scan the input grid from *bottom-most* to *top-most* rows.
   * For each row, scan from *right-to-left*.
   * Change the first encountered red pixel to blue (1) *unless* it is the pixel that was changed in the step one.

   if no other red pixels are found, the transformation is complete.
