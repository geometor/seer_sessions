Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.\n*   The primary colors involved are white(0) and red(2), and the task introduces blue(1).\n*   The transformation seems to involve a change in color of a single pixel, specifically changing a red(2) pixel to a blue(1) pixel or adding a blue(1) pixel.\n*    The position is important, specifically, where on a row or on a column does that happen?\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

If no red pixels exist go to 2.\n\n2.  **Change Color:** If a red pixel is found, change it from red(2) to blue(1). If no red pixels exist, locate the last non-white(0) pixel reading down column 3 (index 2). From this location, moving down, add a blue(1) pixel below that, in the next available white(0) space.\n\nLet's walk through the examples using that approach and test this for confirmation.\n\n*   **Example 1:** The bottom-most, right-most red pixel is at (2, 3). Change it to blue.\n*   **Example 2:** The bottom-most, right-most red pixel is at (2,3). Change it to blue. Locate next white space in the same column, and it becomes (3,2), place a blue there.\n*    **Example 3:** The bottom-most, right-most red pixel is at (1, 2). Change it to blue.\n*    **Example 4:** The bottom-most, right-most red pixel is at (2, 0). Change it to blue.\n"
