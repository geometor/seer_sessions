Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided examples and discern the transformation logic. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   The primary colors involved are white(0) and red(2), and the task introduces blue(1).
*   The transformation seems to involve a change in color of a single pixel, specifically changing a red(2) pixel to a blue(1) pixel or adding a blue(1) pixel.
*    The position is important, specifically, where on a row or on a column does that happen?

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - elements: integers (0-9)
      - color_map: {0: white, 1: blue, 2: red} # Only relevant colors for brevity

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (mapped to a color name)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: change_color
    description: A pixel's color changes from red to blue.
    details: "It always is blue replacing red or adding blue."

  - type: add_color
    description: Adds a blue pixel

relationships:
  - adjacency: Pixels are adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
  - position_change: There is some kind of detection of location of replacement or addition

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixel:** Examine the input grid. Locate the bottom-most, and then right-most red(2) pixel. If no red pixels exist go to 2.

2.  **Change Color:** If a red pixel is found, change it from red(2) to blue(1). If no red pixels exist, locate the last non-white(0) pixel reading down column 3 (index 2). From this location, moving down, add a blue(1) pixel below that, in the next available white(0) space.

Let's walk through the examples using that approach and test this for confirmation.

*   **Example 1:** The bottom-most, right-most red pixel is at (2, 3). Change it to blue.
*   **Example 2:** The bottom-most, right-most red pixel is at (2,3). Change it to blue. Locate next white space in the same column, and it becomes (3,2), place a blue there.
*    **Example 3:** The bottom-most, right-most red pixel is at (1, 2). Change it to blue.
*    **Example 4:** The bottom-most, right-most red pixel is at (2, 0). Change it to blue.
