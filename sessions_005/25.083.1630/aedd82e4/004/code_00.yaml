objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    properties:
      - rows: variable
      - columns: variable

actions:
  - name: change_color
    input: grid, pixel coordinates, color
    output: modified grid
    description: Changes the color of a specified pixel in the grid.
    constraints:
      - color_change: red (2) to blue (1)

observations:
  - example_1:
      bottom_right_red: (4,3)
      changed_pixel_to_blue: (2,3)
      note: bottom_right_red *not* changed
  - example_2:
    bottom_right_red: (3,1)
    changed_pixels:
      - (2,3) - from 2 (red) to 1 (blue)
      - (3,1) - from 2 (red) to 1 (blue)
    note: the bottom right red pixel *is* changed.
    note: first available is not top-left
  - example_3:
      bottom_right_red: (2,1)
      changed_pixels:
        - (1,2) - from 2 (red) to 1 (blue)
        - (2,1) - from 2 (red) to 1 (blue)
  - example_4:
    bottom_right_red: (2,0)
    changed_pixel_to_blue: (2,0)
    note: only one change
