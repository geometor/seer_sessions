The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The most prominent change appears to be the modification of a specific color in the input grid to form a 2x2 block of another color in the output grid. The background, represented by the digit '6' (magenta), remains constant.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
