facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid's dimensions are consistently derived from the input grid's dimensions: output height is 3 times the input height, and output width is 2 times the input width.
  - observation: |
      The transformation involves a replication of the input pixels in the output grid. It is a checkerboard like pattern.
  - observation: |
     The input pixel at (i,j) seems to create a 2x2 pattern of 4 pixels in the output.
  - observation: |
     Input pixels that appear in the first and last column of a row appear repeated in a 2x2 checkerboard pattern.
  - observation: |
     The code does correctly compute the height and width of the output.
