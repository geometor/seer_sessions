facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid's height is three times the input grid's height.
  - observation: |
      The output grid's width is two times the input grid's width.
  - observation: |
      The transformation involves replicating and repositioning elements.
      The output is not based on 3x3 blocks.
  - observation:
      The top-left pixel of the input grid does not universally dictate the background. The background color is not used consistently.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers (0-9)
      height: 3 * input_grid height
      width: 2 * input_grid width
  - action: transformation
    description: Replicates and repositions pixels from the input grid to create the output grid.
    details: The current rule places input grid values into the upper left 2x2 corner of a 3 x 2 grid and alternates the color with the color to its right. The remaining cells are filled with the original color.
