The core pattern seems to be an expansion of the input grid, with a specific arrangement of the original input pixels within the expanded output. The output grid appears to be a 3x3 \"block\" expansion of the input, and input pixels appear to be on a checkerboard. The non-input pixels in the output seem to consistently match the color in the top left pixel of the input.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

This will be the background color for the output grid.\n\n2.  **Calculate Output Dimensions:** The output grid's dimensions are calculated by multiplying each dimension of the input grid by 3 and subtracting 1.  So, if the input is `n x m`, the output is `(3n-1) x (3m-1)`.\n\n3.  **Checkerboard Expansion:** Create the output grid filled with the determined background color, then we're doing an expansion.\n\n4.  **Populate Output:** Iterate through each cell of the *input* grid. For each cell at `input[i][j]`:\n    *   Place the value of `input[i][j]` into the output grid at position `output[i*2][j*2]`.\n\n5.  The result of step 4 populates the output grid according to a checkerboard pattern, overlaid onto the background.\n"
