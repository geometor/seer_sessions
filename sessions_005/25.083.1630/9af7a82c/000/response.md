Okay, I'm ready to analyze this task and provide my observations. Here's my breakdown of the input-output examples:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are rectangular grids of varying dimensions.
*   **Colors:** Each cell in the grid has a single color, represented by a digit (0-9).
*   **Objectness:** The input grids seem to have horizontal lines of colors, each may be an object. I will observe object properties, including positions.
* **Transformation:** A transformation is performed which alters the positions of colors in the objects and introduces many 0 (white) cells.
* **Output dimensions** It appears that each output is a fixed 5 rows tall, with the same number of columns as the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Consider each horizontal row of the input grid as distinct objects.
2.  **Reorder Columns:** Reverse the horizontal order of colors within each input row object, placing it in the same row number of the output.
3.  **Output Dimensions:** output is always 5 rows tall, input row count is less than or equal to 5.
4.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill the remaining cells of the output grid with 0 (white).
