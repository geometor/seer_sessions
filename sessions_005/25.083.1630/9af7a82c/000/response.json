Here's my breakdown of the input-output examples:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Grids:** The input and output are rectangular grids of varying dimensions.\n*   **Colors:** Each cell in the grid has a single color, represented by a digit (0-9).\n*   **Objectness:** The input grids seem to have horizontal lines of colors, each may be an object. I will observe object properties, including positions.\n* **Transformation:** A transformation is performed which alters the positions of colors in the objects and introduces many 0 (white) cells.\n* **Output dimensions** It appears that each output is a fixed 5 rows tall, with the same number of columns as the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
