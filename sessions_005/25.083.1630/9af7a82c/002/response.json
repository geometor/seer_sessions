            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the results and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and generated code were too simplistic. While it correctly reversed each row, it failed to account for a crucial pattern evident across all examples: a consistent, modified \"L\" shape formed in the output, and a specific ordering of colors within that shape. The code also doesn't handle the output grid size or color placement correctly. My strategy is to analyze the common features among all the *correct* output examples, then build logic to replicate that.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Output Structure:** Determine the consistent elements in the output grids (the \"L\" shape).  Focus on how color ordering is used for all output rows.\n2.  **Refine Object Definition:**  The initial idea of rows as objects is partially correct, but needs more nuance. We need to consider how colors *within* each row relate to colors in *other* rows in the *output*.\n3.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** Create a new description that reflects the \"L\" shape creation and the specific color placement rule.\n4.  **Iterative Code Adjustment:** Translate the refined program into updated Python code.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for verification):**\n\nFirst, I need to gather some consistent metrics about the output grids. Let's focus on identifying color transitions in columns and how to describe them.\n\n"
