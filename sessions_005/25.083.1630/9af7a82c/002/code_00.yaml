observations:
  - object_definition: |
      The input grid's rows can be treated as collections of colored pixels.
      The output grid forms a consistent structure resembling an "L" shape, where the first color of each input row extends downwards, and the remaining colors of each row form a horizontal extension.
  - output_structure:
      - shape: "L" composed of the first color of each input row
        columns: |
          Each output column contains non-zero values transitioning once (or not at all).
          Output column colors are in the reverse of their row order within the input grid.

  - color_ordering:
    - rule: The first color in each *input* row becomes the vertical part of the "L" in the *output*. Remaining *input* row colors are added, in reverse, to extend horizontally from that vertical line.
    - consistency: All examples show this consistent color placement.
  - size_consistency:
      output_rows: The number of output rows matches the number of input rows, plus a number of extra all zero rows to bring total number of rows to 5 or 6
      output_cols: The number of output columns matches the number of columns of the input
