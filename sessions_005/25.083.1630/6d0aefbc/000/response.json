Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements**\n\n*   The inputs and outputs are grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.\n*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are different but related. The output grid appears to be an expanded version of the input grid.\n*    The transformation involves some form of mirroring or reflection of the input grid's elements, both horizontally and vertically.\n*   The core structure/shape of the input seems to be preserved and duplicated in the output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts**\n\n"
