The primary colors involved seem to be orange (7) and magenta (6), with the output introducing red (2) in place of some of the magenta pixels. The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple color substitution (i.e., all 6s become 2s) because magenta pixels remain in the output. Therefore, the transformation rule likely depends on the *position* or *spatial relationships* of the magenta pixels. A visual inspection suggests that magenta (6) pixels are being replaced by red (2) pixels where the magenta pixels are making contact with at least 2 other magenta pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
