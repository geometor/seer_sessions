facts:
  - input_grid: A 2D array of integers representing colored pixels.
  - output_grid: A 2D array of integers representing colored pixels, same dimensions as input_grid.
  - colors:
    - 7: orange
    - 6: magenta
    - 2: red
  - transformation:
    - type: Conditional color change.
    - condition:  A magenta (6) pixel changes to red (2) based on its neighbors.
    - neighborhood:  Orthogonal (up, down, left, right) neighboring pixels are considered.
  - rule: If an magenta cell have two or more magenta neighbors changes to color red.
