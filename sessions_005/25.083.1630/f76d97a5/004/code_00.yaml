examples:
  - example_1:
      input:
        objects:
          - color: 5 # Gray
            shape: Irregular, scattered
            count: 10
          - color: 6 # Magenta
            shape: Forms an "X" shape, connected diagonally and orthogonally
            count: 15
      output:
        objects:
          - color: 0 # Background/White
            shape: Fills the negative space of the "X"
            count: 15
          - color: 6 # Magenta
            shape: "X" shape
            count: 10
      transformation:
        - The color 6 (magenta) "X" shape is preserved.
        - The color 5 (gray) is replaced by color 0 (background/white)

  - example_2:
      input:
         objects:
          - color: 4  #yellow
            shape: two vertical lines of length 2 separated by one column
            count: 4
          - color: 5 #gray
            shape: horizontal line of length 3 and two single pixels
            count: 5
      output:
        objects:
          - color: 0 #background
            shape: two vertical lines of length 2 separated by one column
            count: 4
          - color: 4 #yellow
            shape: A plus shape
            count: 5
      transformation:
        - The color 4 pixels form a "+" shape.
        - The remaining pixels are set to 0 (background)
  - example_3:
      input:
        objects:
          - color: 9 # Maroon
            shape: Forms an "X" shape
            count: 18
          - color: 5 # Gray
            shape: Scattered, fills the gaps within the larger "X"
            count: 7
      output:
        objects:
          - color: 0 # Background
            shape: Fills the negative space of the "X"
            count: 18
          - color: 9 # Maroon
            shape: "X" shape
            count: 7
      transformation:
        - The color 9 (maroon) "X" shape is preserved (but slightly shifted).
        - Color 5 (gray) is replaced by 0 (background).
