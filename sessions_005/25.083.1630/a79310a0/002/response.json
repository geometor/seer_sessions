            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels and attempts to replace them with red (2) pixels. However, it fails to accurately replicate the *shape* and *position* of the original azure blocks. The current implementation only places a single red pixel at the top-left corner of where each azure object was located. The core issue is that the `find_center` function only returns the top, left point and the placing of the red blocks does not maintain the shape of the original object.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Representation:** Instead of just storing the top-left corner, we should store the full shape of the azure object.\n2.  **Correct Placement:** calculate the correct position where the shape must be replicated to\n3.  **Shape Replication:** The code needs to accurately copy the shape of the azure object using red pixels.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, highlighting key observations:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: 3x3, single azure pixel.\n    *   Expected: Single red pixel, vertically and horizontally centered.\n    *   Actual: Single red pixel at the azure pixel's original location (top left of this object).\n    *   Issue: Incorrect placement\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: 5x5, 2x2 azure square.\n    *   Expected: 2x2 red square, vertically and horizontally centered in the output grid.\n    *   Actual: Single red pixel top left corner of original object.\n    *   Issue: Incorrect placement, shape not replicated.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: 5x5, 1x3 horizontal azure line.\n    *   Expected: 1x3 red line, horizontally centered.\n    *   Actual: Single red pixel,\n    *   Issue: incorrect placement, shape not replicated.\n\n**YAML Fact Extraction:**\n\n"
