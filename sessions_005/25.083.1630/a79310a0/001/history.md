Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** Grids of varying sizes containing '0' (white) and '8' (azure) pixels. The azure pixels appear to form contiguous shapes (objects).
*   **Output:** Grids of the same size as the input, with '0' (white) and '2' (red) pixels. The red pixels seem to mirror the shape and location of the azure objects in the input, but shifted.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to involve identifying azure objects, and creating red objects of the same shape in a different, specific position relative to the original.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: azure_object
    type: contiguous_block
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - shape: variable
      - position: variable

  - name: red_object
    type: contiguous_block
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - shape: same as corresponding azure_object
      - position: related to corresponding azure_object's position

actions:
  - name: identify_azure_objects
    description: Locate all contiguous blocks of azure pixels.

  - name: create_red_object
    description: Generate a red object with the same shape as the azure object.

  - name: position_red_object
    description:  Place the red object in a specific location related to azure object, seemingly centered vertically and horizontally within the grid if possible.
  
  - name: find_center
    description: finds vertical and horizontal center based on azure object

relationships:
  - type: shape_correspondence
    between: azure_object and red_object
    description: The red object has the same shape as the corresponding azure object.

  - type: position_relation
    between: azure_object and red_object
    description: The exact relationship needs further clarification. It seems that the output positions a red block of the same size at a centered y, x.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Scan the input grid and find all contiguous blocks (objects) of azure (8) pixels.
2.  **Find object center**: Determine the center of each azure object based on its original y,x
3. **Create Red Objects:** For each identified azure object, create a corresponding object of the same shape using red (2) pixels.
4.  **Center:** Position each red object with original center based on x,y.
5.  **Output:** Construct an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with white (0) pixels, and place the created red objects into their calculated position.

Essentially the program looks for blocks of azure and recolors them to red and places the blocks in the same shape using the new x,y from find center.
