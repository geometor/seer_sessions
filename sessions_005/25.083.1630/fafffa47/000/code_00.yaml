objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [white, blue, maroon]
      - dimensions: variable
    observations:
      - "Has distinct top and bottom sections based on color composition."
      - "Top section contains only white and maroon."
      - "Bottom sections contain only white and blue."

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [white, red]
      - dimensions: [3, 3] # Always 3x3
    observations:
     - Consistently smaller than input grids.
     - one and only one red cell in each row
     - one and only one red cell in each column

  - name: maroon_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: maroon
      - value: 9
    observations:
      - "Present in the top sections of input_grids"

  - name: white_pixel_in
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white
      - value: 0
    observations:
      - Present in all grids

  - name: white_pixel_out
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white
      - value: 0
    observations:
      - Present in all grids

  - name: red_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: red
      - value: 2
    observations:
      - Present in only the output grids

  - name: blue_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: blue
      - value: 1
    observations:
      - Present in only the lower parts of input grids

actions:
  - name: transform
    description: "Transforms the top section of the input_grid into the output_grid."
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid

relationships:
    - "output grid is created only from top section of input grid"
    - "the location of maroon (9) in the top part of the input becomes red (2) in the output"
