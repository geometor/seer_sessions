Okay, I'm ready to analyze this task and provide my observations. Here's my breakdown of the provided input-output examples:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 3x3 grid. The input grids seem to have a pattern where one color is prominent, and the others are mostly black (0). The output grids also exhibit a pattern, related to the input, but with different colors. The transformation seems to swap the colors, with particular rules of replacing and positioning.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
observations:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    description: Input and output are both 3x3 grids.
  - type: object
    attribute: color
    values: 0-9 (integers representing colors)
    description: Each cell in the grid contains a single-digit integer representing a color.
  - type: transformation
    description: The primary non-black color in the input grid seems to be replaced in a mirrored and potentially rotated and reflected way.
  - type: pattern_replacement
    input_color1: 5 # gray
    output_color1: 4 # yellow
    input_color2: 8 # light blue
    output_color2: 2 # red
    input_color3: 3
    output_color3: 1
    description: replacement of color value
  - type: spatial_relationship
    description: The position and color seem dependent. The non-zero values rotate counterclockwise around the center of the grid replacing the value with the output mapping, and the center value is zeroed.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the dominant color:** Find the non-zero color that appears in the input grid. If there are two non-zero colors that appear with equal frequency and not in the center, favor the top left one.
2.  **Zero the Center:** the center cell of the output grid is always 0.
3.  **Map Colors**: transform the dominant color to its mapped pair:
    *   5 (gray) becomes 4 (yellow)
    *   8 (light blue) becomes 2 (red)
    *   3 (green) becomes 1 (blue)
4.  **Rotate Counter-Clockwise:** Place the transformed color in the output grid by rotating the positions of the input color 90 degrees counter-clockwise. For instance, if the color was in the top-left of the *input*, it will be in the top-center in the *output* grid; if on the top-right it goes on the left-center, etc. All positions of the input color are transformed.
5. **Fill remaining cells**: fill all the other positions with 0
