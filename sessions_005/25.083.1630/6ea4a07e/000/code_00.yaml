observations:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    description: Input and output are both 3x3 grids.
  - type: object
    attribute: color
    values: 0-9 (integers representing colors)
    description: Each cell in the grid contains a single-digit integer representing a color.
  - type: transformation
    description: The primary non-black color in the input grid seems to be replaced in a mirrored and potentially rotated and reflected way.
  - type: pattern_replacement
    input_color1: 5 # gray
    output_color1: 4 # yellow
    input_color2: 8 # light blue
    output_color2: 2 # red
    input_color3: 3
    output_color3: 1
    description: replacement of color value
  - type: spatial_relationship
    description: The position and color seem dependent. The non-zero values rotate counterclockwise around the center of the grid replacing the value with the output mapping, and the center value is zeroed.
