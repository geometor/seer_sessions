"""
Transforms a 3x3 input grid to a 3x3 output grid based on these rules:

1.  **Identify the dominant color:** Find the non-zero color that appears most frequently in the input grid. If there are two non-zero colors that appear with equal frequency, select the top-left most one.
2.  **Color Mapping**: Transform the dominant color to its mapped pair:
    *   5 (gray) becomes 4 (yellow)
    *   8 (azure) becomes 2 (red)
    *   3 (green) becomes 1 (blue)
3.  **Rotate Counter-Clockwise:** Place the transformed color in the output grid by rotating *each* position of the input color 90 degrees counter-clockwise.  The rotation formula for a point (r,c) around a 3x3 grid is: (new_r, new_c) = (c, 2-r)
4.  **Zero the Center:** The center cell of the output grid is always 0.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the results, analysis, and proposed changes to the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a single example and, while conceptually on the right track (identifying a dominant color, mapping it, and rotating), it clearly doesn't generalize well to all cases. The primary issue seems to be in the *placement* of the transformed color after rotation. The original code applies the rotation transformation to *each instance* of the dominant color. However, examining the expected outputs, it becomes evident that the transformation isn't about moving individual pixels of the dominant color. Instead, the entire input grid, *as a whole*, appears to be conceptually rotated, and only *then* is the color of the originally-dominant shape replaced by its mapped color. The center is zeroed _after_ the rotation and replacement.

The strategy will be to:

1.  **Verify the Dominant Color Logic:** Ensure `get_dominant_color` works correctly in all cases, including ties.
2.  **Correct the Rotation and Replacement Logic:** Re-conceptualize the transformation. The input grid should be conceptually rotated first. Then the color of dominant object in the _original_ grid should be changed to the mapped value in the _rotated_ grid.
3. Zero the center.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here, I'll summarize key observations from each example, noting discrepancies between expected and actual outputs.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Dominant Color: 5 (gray)
    *   Mapped Color: 4 (yellow)
    *   Issue: Incorrect placement of the yellow pixels. The rotation logic applies to each '5' individually, instead of treating the connected '5's as a single rotated object.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Dominant Color: 8 (azure)
    *   Mapped Color: 2 (red)
    *   Issue: Similar to Example 1, the '2's are misplaced due to the incorrect per-pixel rotation.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Dominant Color: 8 (azure)
    *   Mapped Color: 2 (red)
    *   Issue: Same as above.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input Dominant Color: 3 (green)
    *   Mapped Color: 1 (blue)
    *   Issue: Same as above.

*   **Example 5:**
    *   Input Dominant Color: 5 (gray)
    *   Mapped Color: 4 (yellow)
    *   Issue: Same as above.

*   **Example 6:**
    *   Input Dominant Color: 8 (azure)
    *   Mapped Color: 2 (red)
    *    Issue: Same as above.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Input Grid:** Receive a 3x3 grid of colored pixels (integers 0-9).
2.  **Dominant Color:** Identify the most frequent non-zero color in the input grid. If multiple colors tie for most frequent, the top-left most color is chosen.
3.  **Conceptual Rotation:**  Mentally rotate the *entire input grid* 90 degrees counter-clockwise. *Do not modify any pixel values yet.* This is a conceptual transformation to determine the new positions of the colors.
4.  **Color Mapping:**  The dominant color from the *original* input grid is mapped to a new color according to the following rules:
    *   5 (gray) becomes 4 (yellow)
    *   8 (azure) becomes 2 (red)
    *   3 (green) becomes 1 (blue)
5.  **Replacement:** In the *rotated* grid, replace all instances of the *original* dominant color with its *mapped* color.
6. **Zero Center:** Set the center cell (1,1) of the resulting grid to 0 (white).
7. **Output Grid:** The resulting 3x3 grid is the output.
