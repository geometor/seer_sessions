Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs and outputs are grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.\n*   The input grids appear to be smaller than the output grids.\n*   The output grids seem to be a patterned expansion of the input grids. It looks like a form of mirroring and possibly repeating the original input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

It involves reflecting across both horizontal and vertical axes.\n"
