## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on object perception, relationships, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of digits, representing colored pixels.
*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical within each example pair (e.g., train\_1: 3x3 input and 3x3 output).
*   The digits (colors) in the input grid appear to be re-arranged in the output grid, with positions seemingly mirrored or rotated.
* The digits present are the same in the input and the output, which means that we are facing a rearrengement of digits.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The set of unique digits is identical between input and output in each example.
  - observation: The transformation involves rearranging/repositioning the digits.
  - observation: The digits are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive.
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: rows x columns
      - elements: digits (representing colors)
  - action: transformation
    type: rearrangement
    details: The positions of the elements in input grid are reordered in the output grid according a 90 degree clockwise rotation.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input Reception:** Receive the input grid.

2.  **Rotation:** Imagine rotating the entire input grid 90 degrees clockwise. The new positions the digits would occupy after this rotation correspond to their positions in the output grid. More formally, we can describe the transformation using index notation. If the original grid has `rows` rows and `columns`, and we denote entry (i,j) by input\[i]\[j] and entry (k,l) in output by output\[k]\[l], then the output grid is related to the input by


```
output[k][l] = input[rows - 1 - l][k]
```


where 0 \<= i, l \< rows and 0 \<= j, k \< columns.

3.  **Output Generation:** Create the output grid with the elements repositioned according to the rule described above.

In essence, the transformation is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input grid.
