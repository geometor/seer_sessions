*   **Perception:** The task involves extracting non-white pixels from a larger input grid and arranging them into a smaller 3x3 output grid. The order of extraction seems crucial, following a specific scanning pattern (column-major). A specific permutation (swapping the 4th and 6th extracted colors) is applied before filling the output grid. The output grid is padded with white if fewer than 9 non-white pixels are found.

*   **Facts YAML:**
    
```yaml
    input_grid_size: 10x10
    output_grid_size: 3x3
    background_color: white (0)
    objects:
      - type: individual pixels
      - property: non-white color
    extraction_rule:
      - Collect all non-white pixels from the input grid.
      - Order the collected pixels based on their position using a column-major scan (top-to-bottom within each column, then left-to-right across columns).
      - Keep only the color values in this order.
    transformation_rule:
      - If the number of collected colors is greater than 5:
          - Swap the color at index 3 (the 4th color) with the color at index 5 (the 6th color) in the ordered list.
    output_construction:
      - Create a 3x3 grid initialized with white (0).
      - Fill the 3x3 grid sequentially (left-to-right, top-to-bottom) using the ordered (and potentially modified) list of colors.
      - Stop filling when the list runs out or the 3x3 grid is full.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an empty list to store the colors of non-white pixels found in the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through the columns of the input grid from left to right (index 0 to 9).
    3.  Within each column, iterate through the rows from top to bottom (index 0 to 9).
    4.  If a cell contains a non-white color (value 1-9), append its color value to the list.
    5.  Check the number of colors collected in the list. If the list contains 6 or more colors, swap the element at index 3 (the 4th color) with the element at index 5 (the 6th color).
    6.  Create a new 3x3 grid, initially filled with white (0).
    7.  Iterate through the cells of the 3x3 output grid, row by row, from left to right (index 0,0 to 2,2).
    8.  For each cell in the output grid, take the next available color from the beginning of the (potentially modified) list and place it in the cell.
    9.  If the list runs out of colors before the 3x3 grid is filled, leave the remaining cells as white (0).
    10. The resulting 3x3 grid is the output.
