The order of extraction seems crucial, following a specific scanning pattern (column-major). A specific permutation (swapping the 4th and 6th extracted colors) is applied before filling the output grid. The output grid is padded with white if fewer than 9 non-white pixels are found.\n\n*   **Facts YAML:**\n    "
