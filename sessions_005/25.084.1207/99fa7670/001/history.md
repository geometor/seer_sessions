Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** Both are 2D grids of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9. White (0) acts as the background.
2.  **Objects:** The core elements appear to be the non-white pixels in the input grid. Let's call these "source pixels".
3.  **Transformation:** The output grid seems to be generated by extending lines or rays from each source pixel.
4.  **Horizontal Extension:** Each source pixel `(r, c)` seems to draw a horizontal line of its color in its row `r`, starting from the column immediately to its right (`c+1`) and extending all the way to the right edge of the grid (`max_col`).
5.  **Vertical Extension:** There's also a vertical component. It appears that for each row `i` below a source pixel's row `r` (`i > r`), the color of the pixel in the *rightmost column* (`max_col`) of that row `i` is determined by one of the source pixels above it (`r < i`).
6.  **Conflict Resolution (Vertical):** When multiple source pixels are above a given row `i`, the one that dictates the color at `(i, max_col)` seems to be the source pixel with the largest row index (closest to row `i`, lowest on the grid). If there's a tie in row index, the source pixel with the largest column index (rightmost) among the tied pixels determines the color. This applies to all rows from `r+1` down to the bottom edge.
7.  **Overwriting:** The original source pixels remain in the output. The horizontal extensions overwrite the initial background (and potentially other weaker extensions, although this rule seems simpler). The vertical extensions overwrite whatever is in the rightmost column based on the defined priority rule.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  background_color: 0 (white)
  objects:
    - type: source_pixel
      description: Any pixel in the input grid with a color other than white (0).
      properties: [row, column, color]
    - type: grid
      properties: [height, width, max_row_index, max_col_index]

transformation_elements:
  - action: identify_sources
    input: input_grid
    output: list of source_pixels [ (row, col, color), ... ]
  - action: horizontal_projection
    input: source_pixel (r, c, color), max_col_index
    effect: Modifies output grid. Fills output[r][j] with 'color' for j from c+1 to max_col_index.
  - action: vertical_projection_right_edge
    input: current_row_index (i), list_of_source_pixels, max_col_index
    effect: Modifies output grid. Determines and sets the color of output[i][max_col_index].
    rule:
      - find sources where source_row < i
      - if sources exist:
        - select source(s) with maximum source_row
        - if tie in source_row, select source with maximum source_col from tied set
        - use the color of the selected source
  - relationship: overwrite_priority
    description: Horizontal projections overwrite the initial grid state. Vertical projections overwrite the grid state in the last column based on the specified source selection rule. Original source pixels are preserved.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as an identical copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Find all "source pixels" in the `input_grid` (pixels with color != 0) and record their `row`, `column`, and `color`.
3.  Get the dimensions of the grid: `height`, `width`, `max_row = height - 1`, `max_col =
