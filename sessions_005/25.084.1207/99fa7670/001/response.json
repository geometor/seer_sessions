Identify all non-white pixels (color != 0) in the input grid as \"source pixels\". Store their row, column, and color.\n3.  For each source pixel `(r, c, color)`:\n    a. Fill the cells in the `output_grid` in the same row `r` from column `c + 1` to the rightmost column (`width - 1`) with the source pixel's `color`.\n4.  Determine the color for the rightmost column (`width - 1`) for each row `i` from top to bottom (0 to `height - 1`):\n    a. Find all source pixels `(sr, sc, scolor)` whose row `sr` is strictly less than the current row `i` (`sr < i`).\n    b. If no such source pixels exist above row `i`, the rightmost cell `output_grid[i, width - 1]` remains unchanged by this step.\n    c. If source pixels exist above row `i`:\n        i. Find the maximum row index (`max_r`) among these source pixels.\n        ii. Identify all source pixels located at this `max_r`.\n        iii. Among those source pixels at `max_r`, find the one with the maximum column index (`max_c`).\n        iv. Set the color of the cell `output_grid[i, width - 1]` to the color of this selected source pixel (the one at `max_r`, `max_c`). This overwrites any previous value in that cell, including values set by the horizontal projection step.\n5.
