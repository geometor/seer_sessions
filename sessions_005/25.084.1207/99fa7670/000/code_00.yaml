task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  background_color: 0 (white)
  objects:
    - type: source_pixel
      description: Any pixel in the input grid with a color other than white (0).
      properties: [row, column, color]
    - type: grid
      properties: [height, width, max_row_index, max_col_index]

transformation_elements:
  - action: identify_sources
    input: input_grid
    output: list of source_pixels [ (row, col, color), ... ]
  - action: horizontal_projection
    input: source_pixel (r, c, color), max_col_index
    effect: Modifies output grid. Fills output[r][j] with 'color' for j from c+1 to max_col_index.
  - action: vertical_projection_right_edge
    input: current_row_index (i), list_of_source_pixels, max_col_index
    effect: Modifies output grid. Determines and sets the color of output[i][max_col_index].
    rule:
      - find sources where source_row < i
      - if sources exist:
        - select source(s) with maximum source_row
        - if tie in source_row, select source with maximum source_col from tied set
        - use the color of the selected source
  - relationship: overwrite_priority
    description: Horizontal projections overwrite the initial grid state. Vertical projections overwrite the grid state in the last column based on the specified source selection rule. Original source pixels are preserved.
