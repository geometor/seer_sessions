            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output:** Both are 2D grids of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9. White (0) acts as the background.\n2.  **Objects:** The core elements appear to be the non-white pixels in the input grid. Let's call these \"source pixels\".\n3.  **Transformation:** The output grid seems to be generated by extending lines or rays from each source pixel.\n4.  **Horizontal Extension:** Each source pixel `(r, c)` seems to draw a horizontal line of its color in its row `r`, starting from the column immediately to its right (`c+1`) and extending all the way to the right edge of the grid (`max_col`).\n5.  **Vertical Extension:** There's also a vertical component. It appears that for each row `i` below a source pixel's row `r` (`i > r`), the color of the pixel in the *rightmost column* (`max_col`) of that row `i` is determined by one of the source pixels above it (`r < i`).\n6.  **Conflict Resolution (Vertical):** When multiple source pixels are above a given row `i`, the one that dictates the color at `(i, max_col)` seems to be the source pixel with the largest row index (closest to row `i`, lowest on the grid). If there's a tie in row index, the source pixel with the largest column index (rightmost) among the tied pixels determines the color. This applies to all rows from `r+1` down to the bottom edge.\n7.  **Overwriting:** The original source pixels remain in the output. The horizontal extensions overwrite the initial background (and potentially other weaker extensions, although this rule seems simpler). The vertical extensions overwrite whatever is in the rightmost column based on the defined priority rule.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
