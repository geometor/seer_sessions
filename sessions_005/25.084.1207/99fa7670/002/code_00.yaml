task_context:
  description: The task involves projecting colors from source pixels horizontally to the right and vertically down the rightmost column based on the history of encountered source pixels.
  grid_properties:
    - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
    - The background color is white (0).
    - Non-white pixels act as sources of color.

objects:
  - name: source_pixel
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (1-9).
      - location: Defined by row (r) and column (c).
      - is_contiguous: Not relevant, single pixels are sources.

actions:
  - name: horizontal_projection
    inputs:
      - source_pixel (r, c, color)
      - output_grid
    outputs:
      - modified output_grid
    description: For a source pixel at (r, c) with 'color', fill all cells in the output_grid at row 'r' from column 'c + 1' to the right edge (width - 1) with 'color'. This is done for all source pixels.
  - name: vertical_projection_rightmost
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - output_grid (after horizontal projection)
    outputs:
      - modified output_grid
    description: |
      Iterate through the output_grid rows (i from 0 to height-1).
      Maintain the 'color' of the last source pixel encountered when scanning the *input_grid* up to the end of the current row 'i'.
      If a last source color exists for row 'i', update the pixel in the output_grid at (i, width-1) with that color.
      If no source pixel has been encountered up to row 'i', the pixel (i, width-1) retains its current value (from initialization or horizontal projection).

processing_order:
  - Initialize output_grid = input_grid.
  - Perform horizontal_projection for all source pixels found in input_grid.
  - Perform vertical_projection_rightmost.
