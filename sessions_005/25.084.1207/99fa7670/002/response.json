            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the transformation rule.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code correctly implemented the horizontal projection observed in the first example. However, it failed on 3 out of 4 training examples, indicating the logic for determining the color of the rightmost column was incorrect or incomplete. The errors consistently appear in the rightmost column, suggesting the \"vertical projection\" part of the rule needs revision.\n\nThe errors occurred when a source pixel appeared in a later row than the sources considered by the previous rule for that specific row's rightmost pixel calculation. This suggests the rule needs to account for the most *recent* source pixel encountered when processing the grid up to the current row.\n\n**Strategy**\n\n1.  Re-examine the input/output pairs for all examples, focusing on how the rightmost column's color is determined in each row.\n2.  Compare the incorrect `Transformed Output` values in the rightmost column with the `Expected Output` values.\n3.  Identify the specific source pixel in the *input* grid that dictates the correct color for the rightmost column in each row.\n4.  Formulate a revised rule for the rightmost column based on these observations, likely involving tracking the \"last seen\" source pixel's color as the grid is processed row by row.\n5.  Update the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**Metrics**\n\n*   **Total Examples:** 4\n*   **Correct Examples (Previous Code):** 1 (Example 2)\n*   **Incorrect Examples (Previous Code):** 3 (Examples 1, 3, 4)\n*   **Error Locations:** All errors occurred exclusively in the rightmost column (`width - 1`).\n    *   Example 1: Error at `(4, 5)`. Expected `5`, got `8`.\n    *   Example 3: Errors at `(3, 4)` and `(5, 4)`. Expected `7` and `6`, got `8` and `7` respectively.\n    *   Example 4: Error at `(3, 5)`. Expected `3`, got `2`.\n\n**Analysis of Rightmost Column Color Determination:**\n\nBy comparing the inputs and expected outputs across all examples, a pattern emerges for the rightmost column:\n\n*   The color in `output[i, width-1]` corresponds to the color of the *last* non-white pixel encountered when scanning the *input* grid in reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) up to the end of row `i`.\n*   If no non-white pixel has been encountered up to the end of row `i`, the pixel `output[i, width-1]` retains the color set by the horizontal projection (or its original color if unaffected).\n\n**Example Trace (New Rule - Example 1):**\n\n*   Input: Source pixels at `(1,1)=8` and `(4,3)=5`. Width = 6.\n*   Row 0: No sources encountered yet. `output[0, 5]` remains `0`.\n*   Row 1: Scan row 0, then row 1. Last source encountered is `(1,1)=8`. `output[1, 5]` becomes `8`.\n*   Row 2: Scan rows 0, 1, 2. Last source encountered is `(1,1)=8`. `output[2, 5]` becomes `8`.\n*   Row 3: Scan rows 0, 1, 2, 3. Last source encountered is `(1,1)=8`. `output[3, 5]` becomes `8`.\n*   Row 4: Scan rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Last source encountered is `(4,3)=5`. `output[4, 5]` becomes `5`.\n*   Row 5: Scan rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Last source encountered is `(4,3)=5`. `output[5, 5]` becomes `5`.\n\nThis matches the expected output for Example 1. Applying this logic to other examples also yields the correct expected outputs.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
