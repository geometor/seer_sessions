            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consistently feature a horizontal line composed entirely of yellow (4) pixels. This line divides the grid into two distinct regions: an upper region above the yellow line and a lower region below it.\n2.  **Color Distribution (Input):**\n    *   The **upper region** contains only red (2) and white (0) pixels.\n    *   The **lower region** contains only blue (1) and white (0) pixels.\n    *   The **separator** line is always yellow (4).\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is always smaller than the input grid. Its dimensions precisely match the dimensions of the lower region of the input grid (below the yellow line).\n4.  **Color Distribution (Output):** The output grid contains only green (3) and white (0) pixels.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The yellow separator line is absent in the output. The output grid seems to be a combination or overlay of the patterns found in the upper and lower regions of the input grid. Specifically, a pixel in the output grid becomes green (3) if the corresponding pixel in the *upper* input region was red (2) *or* if the corresponding pixel in the *lower* input region was blue (1). If neither of these conditions is met (i.e., both corresponding input pixels were white), the output pixel remains white (0).\n\n## Facts\n\n```"
