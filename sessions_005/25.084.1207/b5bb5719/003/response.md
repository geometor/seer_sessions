```python
"""
Applies a 1D cellular automaton rule vertically down the grid.

The transformation operates row by row, starting from the second row (index 1).
The color of a cell at position (r, c) for r > 0 is determined by the colors
of the three cells in the row above (r-1) centered at column c: (r-1, c-1),
(r-1, c), and (r-1, c+1).

If a cell's neighborhood falls outside the grid boundary (left or right edge),
the missing neighbor is treated as having the color orange (7).

12 specific neighborhood patterns map to either red (2) or gray (5).
All other neighborhood patterns map to the default color orange (7).
The first row of the grid remains unchanged.
