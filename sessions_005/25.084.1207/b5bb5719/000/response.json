            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example pair. The number of rows and columns varies between examples.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The colors observed are orange (7), gray (5), and red (2). Orange appears to be a background or default color, especially in the rows below the first one in the input.\n3.  **Input Pattern:** The first row of each input grid contains a specific pattern composed of gray (5), red (2), and sometimes orange (7). The rows below the first row are initially filled entirely with orange (7).\n4.  **Output Pattern:** The first row of the output grid is identical to the first row of the input grid. Changes occur exclusively in the rows below the first one. New patterns involving gray (5) and red (2) emerge in these lower rows, replacing some of the orange (7) pixels.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation appears to operate row by row, starting from the second row. The color of a cell in a given row seems to be determined by the colors of the three cells immediately above it (above-left, directly above, above-right) in the preceding row. This suggests a 1D cellular automaton rule applied vertically downwards.\n6.  **Rule Application:** Specific combinations of colors in the 3-cell neighborhood in the row above trigger the appearance of a non-orange color (red or gray) in the cell below. If no specific rule is met, the cell below becomes orange (7).\n7.  **Boundary Conditions:** For cells at the left or right edges of the grid, the missing neighbor outside the grid boundary seems to be treated as orange (7) for the purpose of applying the rules.\n8.  **Iteration:** The process iterates downwards. The generation of row `i` depends on the final state of row `i-1`.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Iterate through each row of the grid, starting from the second row (row index 1) down to the last row. Let the current row index be `r`.\n3.  For each cell within the current row `r`, let its column index be `c`.\n4.  Identify the three relevant cells in the row above (`r-1`):\n    *   The cell directly above: `(r-1, c)`.\n    *   The cell above and to the left: `(r-1, c-1)`. If `c` is 0 (the first column), treat the left neighbor's color as orange (7).\n    *   The cell above and to the right: `(r-1, c+1)`. If `c` is the last column index, treat the right neighbor's color as orange (7).\n5.  Record the colors of these three cells (left, center, right) as the \"neighborhood pattern\".\n6.  Check if this neighborhood pattern matches any of the following predefined rules:\n    *   If pattern is `(2, 5, 2)`, the new color is gray (5).\n    *   If pattern is `(5, 2, 5)`, the new color is red (2).\n    *   If pattern is `(5, 7, 2)`, the new color is red (2).\n    *   If pattern is `(2, 7, 2)`, the new color is gray (5).\n    *   If pattern is `(2, 7, 5)`, the new color is gray (5).\n    *   If pattern is `(5, 7, 5)`, the new color is red (2).\n    *   If pattern is `(5, 5, 2)`, the new color is red (2).\n    *   If pattern is `(2, 2, 5)`, the new color is gray (5).\n    *   If pattern is `(2, 5, 5)`, the new color is red (2).\n    *   If pattern is `(5, 5, 5)`, the new color is red (2).\n    *   If pattern is `(7, 2, 2)`, the new color is gray (5).\n    *   If pattern is `(7, 5, 5)`, the new color is red (2).\n    *   If pattern is `(5, 2, 2)`, the new color is gray (5).\n    *   If pattern is `(7, 2, 5)`, the new color is gray (5).\n    *   If pattern is `(7, 5, 2)`, the new color is red (2).\n    *   If pattern is `(2, 2, 2)`, the new color is gray (5).\n7.  If a matching rule is found, update the color of the cell at `(r, c)` in the *output grid* to the new color specified by the rule.\n8.  If the neighborhood pattern does not match any of the rules, set the color of the cell at `(r, c)` in the *output grid* to orange (7).\n9.  After iterating through all cells in all rows from 1 downwards, the resulting output grid is the final transformation."
