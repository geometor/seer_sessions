# Note: Rules involving 7 (Orange) as boundary condition are handled differently now.
# The original code had specific rules for boundary conditions like (7, 2, 2).
# The new analysis shows these often result in the default color 7.
# Let's explicitly list the new specific rules:
# (2,2,2)->5, (2,2,5)->5, (2,5,2)->5, (2,5,5)->5, (2,7,2)->5, (2,7,5)->5
# (5,2,2)->2, (5,2,5)->2, (5,5,2)->2, (5,5,5)->2, (5,7,2)->2, (5,7,5)->2
