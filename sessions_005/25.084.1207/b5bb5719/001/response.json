If a cell is \nat the edge of the grid, any neighbor falling outside the grid boundary is \ntreated as having the default color orange (7). If no specific rule matches \nthe neighborhood pattern, the cell at (r, c) takes the default color orange (7). \nThe first row of the grid remains unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the cellular automaton rule to transform the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid represented as a list of lists of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Convert input to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_np)\n    \n    # Get grid dimensions\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules based on the neighborhood (left, center, right) above\n    # Key: tuple (left_color, center_color, right_color)\n    # Value: resulting color for the cell below the center\n    RULES = {\n        (2, 5, 2): 5,  # Red, Gray, Red -> Gray\n        (5, 2, 5): 2,  # Gray, Red, Gray -> Red\n        (5, 7, 2): 2,  # Gray, Orange, Red -> Red\n        (2, 7, 2): 5,  # Red, Orange, Red -> Gray\n        (2, 7, 5): 5,  # Red, Orange, Gray -> Gray\n        (5, 7, 5): 2,  # Gray, Orange, Gray -> Red\n        (5, 5, 2): 2,  # Gray, Gray, Red -> Red\n        (2, 2, 5): 5,  # Red, Red, Gray -> Gray\n        (2, 5, 5): 2,  # Red, Gray, Gray -> Red\n        (5, 5, 5): 2,  # Gray, Gray, Gray -> Red\n        (7, 2, 2): 5,  # Orange, Red, Red -> Gray\n        (7, 5, 5): 2,  # Orange, Gray, Gray -> Red\n        (5, 2, 2): 5,  # Gray, Red, Red -> Gray\n        (7, 2, 5): 5,  # Orange, Red, Gray -> Gray\n        (7, 5, 2): 2,  # Orange, Gray, Red -> Red\n        (2, 2, 2): 5,  # Red, Red, Red -> Gray\n    }\n    \n    # Define the default color (orange)\n    DEFAULT_COLOR = 7\n\n    # Iterate through rows starting from the second row (index 1)\n    for r in range(1, height):\n        # Iterate through columns\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Get the color of the cell directly above\n            center_above = output_grid[r-1, c]\n            \n            # Get the color of the cell above and to the left, handling boundary\n            if c > 0:\n                left_above = output_grid[r-1, c-1]\n            else:\n                left_above = DEFAULT_COLOR # Boundary condition\n                \n            # Get the color of the cell above and to the right, handling boundary\n            if c < width - 1:\n                right_above = output_grid[r-1, c+1]\n            else:\n                right_above = DEFAULT_COLOR # Boundary condition\n                \n            # Form the neighborhood pattern tuple\n            neighborhood = (left_above, center_above, right_above)\n            \n            # Check if the neighborhood matches a rule\n            if neighborhood in RULES:\n                # Apply the rule's color\n                output_grid[r, c] = RULES[neighborhood]\n            else:\n                # Apply the default color if no rule matches\n                output_grid[r, c] = DEFAULT_COLOR\n                \n    # Convert the result back to a list of lists before returning\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n\n```"
