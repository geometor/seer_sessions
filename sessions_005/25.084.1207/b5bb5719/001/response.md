```python
"""
Applies a transformation rule based on a 1D cellular automaton pattern applied vertically.

The transformation operates row by row, starting from the second row (index 1).
The color of a cell at position (r, c) for r > 0 is determined by the colors 
of the three cells in the row above (r-1) centered at column c: (r-1, c-1), 
(r-1, c), and (r-1, c+1). 

Specific rules map certain 3-pixel neighborhood patterns in row r-1 to a 
specific color (red (2) or gray (5)) in the cell at (r, c). If a cell is 
at the edge of the grid, any neighbor falling outside the grid boundary is 
treated as having the default color orange (7). If no specific rule matches 
the neighborhood pattern, the cell at (r, c) takes the default color orange (7). 
The first row of the grid remains unchanged.
