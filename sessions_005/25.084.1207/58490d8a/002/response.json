            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the white rectangular area in each input grid and created an output grid of the corresponding size. However, it failed because it simply copied the content within the white rectangle from the input to the output. The results clearly show that the non-white pixels *inside* the white rectangle undergo a transformation, specifically a form of horizontal repetition, rather than a direct copy.\n\nThe strategy to resolve the errors is to:\n1.  Re-examine the relationship between the input and output grids, focusing specifically on the region defined by the white rectangle.\n2.  Identify the rule governing how the non-white pixels within this region are transformed or generated in the output.\n3.  Observe the role of elements *outside* the white rectangle in the input grid, as they likely influence the transformation occurring inside.\n4.  Formulate a new natural language program based on these refined observations.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's extract the relevant subgrids (input within the white rectangle and the expected output) for comparison.\n\n"
