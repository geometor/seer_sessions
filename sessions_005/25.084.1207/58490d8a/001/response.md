Identify the rectangular region within the input grid that consists entirely of 
white (0) pixels. Determine the top-left and bottom-right coordinates of this 
white rectangle. Create a new grid whose dimensions match the height and width 
of the identified white rectangle. Copy the pixels from the input grid located

their relative positions. This new grid is the output.
