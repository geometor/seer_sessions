task_type: flood_fill

components:
  - role: background
    description: The most frequent color in the input grid. This color is subject to being replaced by the fill_color in specific regions.
    example_colors: [blue (1), white (0), orange (7)]
  - role: seed_pixel
    description: A single pixel in the input grid whose color is unique and distinct from the background and other structural elements.
    properties:
      - count: 1 per grid
      - color: determines the fill_color
      - location: determines the starting point for the fill
    example_colors: [maroon (9), yellow (4), green (3)]
  - role: fill_color
    description: The color used to fill the target region. It is the same as the color of the seed_pixel.
    example_colors: [maroon (9), yellow (4), green (3)]
  - role: boundary_pixels
    description: Pixels whose color is not the background color. They block the spread of the fill and are not modified by the transformation. This includes the original seed pixel and any other non-background colors.
    example_colors: [green (3), gray (5), maroon (9), magenta (6), azure (8)]
  - role: fill_region
    description: The connected area of background-colored pixels reachable from the seed_pixel without crossing any boundary_pixels.

transformation:
  type: conditional_replacement
  predicate: A pixel is replaced if it has the background color AND it is part of the fill_region.
  replacement_value: fill_color
  connectivity: 4-directional (up, down, left, right)

input_output_relationship:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - preservation: All pixels that are not the background color in the input retain their original color and position in the output.
  - modification: Some background-colored pixels in the input are changed to the fill_color in the output.
