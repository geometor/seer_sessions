            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples involve transforming a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example.\n2.  **Background Color:** Each input grid has a predominant background color (blue in ex1, white in ex2, orange in ex3). This background color appears to be the most frequent color in the input.\n3.  **Boundary/Structure Colors:** There are other colors present that often form lines, shapes, or scattered points (green/gray in ex1, gray in ex2, maroon/magenta/azure in ex3). These colors seem to remain unchanged in the output grid.\n4.  **Seed Color:** In each input grid, there is exactly one pixel of a specific color that is neither the background nor part of the main structures (maroon in ex1, yellow in ex2, green in ex3). This pixel's color becomes important in the output.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a \"flood fill\" or \"paint bucket\" operation. The area connected to the unique \"seed\" pixel, consisting of the background color, is filled with the \"seed\" color.\n6.  **Fill Propagation:** The fill spreads outwards from the seed pixel's location. It only changes pixels that originally had the background color.\n7.  **Fill Boundaries:** The fill stops when it encounters any pixel whose color is *not* the background color (this includes the boundary/structure colors, the original seed pixel, and any other non-background colors) or the edge of the grid. Pixels that are not the background color are never overwritten by the fill.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
