The spatial arrangement of these objects in the input doesn't seem to directly map to the output arrangement.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output is always a square grid. The size of the output grid varies depending on the input. The output grid consists of concentric square layers or frames, each of a single color.\n5.  **Color Preservation:** The colors present in the output are exactly the non-background colors found in the input. No new colors are introduced, and no non-background colors are removed (other than the background itself).\n6.  **Transformation Core Logic:** The transformation involves identifying the non-background colors, counting their occurrences in the input, sorting these colors based on their counts (with a tie-breaking rule), determining the output grid size based on the number of unique colors, and constructing the output grid by drawing concentric squares of these sorted colors, starting from the center outwards.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Count the total number of pixels for each of these foreground colors.\n4.  **Sort Colors:** Create an ordered list of the foreground colors. Sort this list based on the counts determined in the previous step, in ascending order (lowest count first). If two colors have the same count, the one with the higher numerical color value comes first (descending order tie-break). Let N be the number of colors in this sorted list.\n5.  **Determine Output Size:** Calculate the side length `S` for the square output grid using the formula `S = 2 * N - 1`.\n6.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an `S x S` grid.\n7.  **Fill Concentric Squares:** Fill the output grid by drawing concentric squares (or frames) of color, starting from the center and moving outwards.\n    *   Use the first color in the sorted list to fill the center 1x1 square.\n    *   Use the second color in the sorted list to fill the 3x3 frame surrounding the center (i.e., all pixels within the 3x3 square that are not the center pixel).\n    *   Use the third color to fill the 5x5 frame surrounding the 3x3 square.\n    *   Continue this process for all N colors. The k-th color in the sorted list (where k ranges from 1 to N) fills the pixels whose maximum distance (Chebyshev distance) from the center pixel is exactly `k-1`.\n8.  **Output:** The resulting `S x S` grid is the final output."
