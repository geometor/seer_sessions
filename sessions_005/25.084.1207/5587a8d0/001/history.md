**Perception of task elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are grids of colored pixels (integers 0-9).
2.  **Background Color:** Each input grid has a predominant color (Orange - 7 in all examples) that acts as a background and is ignored in the transformation process.
3.  **Input Objects:** The non-background pixels form distinct objects or collections of pixels of specific colors. The spatial arrangement of these objects in the input doesn't seem to directly map to the output arrangement.
4.  **Output Structure:** The output is always a square grid. The size of the output grid varies depending on the input. The output grid consists of concentric square layers or frames, each of a single color.
5.  **Color Preservation:** The colors present in the output are exactly the non-background colors found in the input. No new colors are introduced, and no non-background colors are removed (other than the background itself).
6.  **Transformation Core Logic:** The transformation involves identifying the non-background colors, counting their occurrences in the input, sorting these colors based on their counts (with a tie-breaking rule), determining the output grid size based on the number of unique colors, and constructing the output grid by drawing concentric squares of these sorted colors, starting from the center outwards.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Create an output grid composed of concentric squares, where the colors and their order are determined by the frequency of non-background colors in the input grid.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors (0-9).
  - element: pixel
    description: A single cell in the grid with a color value.
  - element: background_color
    description: The most frequent color in the input grid, ignored during transformation. Identified by finding the mode of pixel values.
  - element: foreground_colors
    description: All unique colors present in the input grid, excluding the background color.
  - element: color_counts
    description: A mapping of each foreground color to its total count in the input grid.
  - element: sorted_colors
    description: Foreground colors sorted primarily by their count in ascending order. Ties are broken by sorting the colors by their numerical value in descending order.
  - element: output_grid
    description: A square grid whose size depends on the number of unique foreground colors (N). Size is (2N-1) x (2N-1).
  - element: concentric_squares
    description: The structure of the output grid, formed by layers of colors from the sorted_colors list. The color with the lowest count (first in sorted_colors) forms the center 1x1 square. The next color forms the surrounding 3x3 frame, and so on, until the outermost frame uses the color with the highest count.

relationships:
  - relationship: counts_determine_order
    description: The frequency of each foreground color in the input determines its position in the concentric squares of the output. Lower count means closer to the center.
  - relationship: number_of_colors_determines_size
    description: The number of unique foreground colors (N) determines the size of the output grid (2N-1) x (2N-1).

actions:
  - action: identify_background
    description: Find the most frequent pixel value in the input grid.
  - action: count_foreground_colors
    description: Count occurrences of all unique pixel values excluding the background color.
  - action: sort_colors
    description: Sort the foreground colors based on count (ascending) and then color value (descending for ties).
  - action: determine_output_size
    description: Calculate the side length of the output grid as S = 2 * (number of sorted colors) - 1.
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create an S x S grid and fill it with concentric squares using the sorted colors, starting from the center. The k-th color in the sorted list fills the pixels at Chebyshev distance k-1 from the center.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze Input:** Examine the input grid to identify all unique pixel colors present and count the occurrences of each color.
2.  **Identify Background:** Determine the background color, which is the color with the highest count in the input grid.
3.  **Identify Foreground Colors & Counts:** List all unique colors present in the input grid *except* for the background color. Count the total number of pixels for each of these foreground colors.
4.  **Sort Colors:** Create an ordered list of the foreground colors. Sort this list based on the counts determined in the previous step, in ascending order (lowest count first). If two colors have the same count, the one with the higher numerical color value comes first (descending order tie-break). Let N be the number of colors in this sorted list.
5.  **Determine Output Size:** Calculate the side length `S` for the square output grid using the formula `S = 2 * N - 1`.
6.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an `S x S` grid.
7.  **Fill Concentric Squares:** Fill the output grid by drawing concentric squares (or frames) of color, starting from the center and moving outwards.
    *   Use the first color in the sorted list to fill the center 1x1 square.
    *   Use the second color in the sorted list to fill the 3x3 frame surrounding the center (i.e., all pixels within the 3x3 square that are not the center pixel).
    *   Use the third color to fill the 5x5 frame surrounding the 3x3 square.
    *   Continue this process for all N colors. The k-th color in the sorted list (where k ranges from 1 to N) fills the pixels whose maximum distance (Chebyshev distance) from the center pixel is exactly `k-1`.
8.  **Output:** The resulting `S x S` grid is the final output.
