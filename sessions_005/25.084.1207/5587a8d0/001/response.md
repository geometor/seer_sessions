Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the background color (most frequent color) in the input grid.
2. Count the occurrences of all unique non-background colors (foreground colors).
3. Sort the foreground colors first by their count in ascending order, then by their color value in descending order as a tie-breaker.
4. Determine the output grid size: S = 2 * N - 1, where N is the number of unique foreground colors.
5. Create an S x S output grid.
6. Fill the output grid with concentric square frames using the sorted colors. The color with the lowest count (first in the sorted list) forms the 1x1 center. The next color forms the surrounding 3x3 frame, and so on. Specifically, the k-th color in the sorted list (index k, 0-based) fills the pixels whose Chebyshev distance from the center is exactly k.
