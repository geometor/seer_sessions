**Analysis of Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 8x8, Output: 3x6
    *   Object: Red (2), BBox: height=3, width=3
    *   Expected Output Width based on `2*width+1`: 7. Actual is 6.
    *   Separator Column (index 3): `[0, 2, 2]`. Not all pixels are the object color (2).
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 8x8, Output: 3x6
    *   Object: Azure (8), BBox: height=3, width=3
    *   Expected Output Width based on `2*width+1`: 7. Actual is 6.
    *   Separator Column (index 3): `[8, 0, 8]`. Not all pixels are the object color (8).
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 8x8, Output: 3x6
    *   Object: Blue (1), BBox: height=3, width=3. **Wait, the code output says height=1, width=2, num_pixels=2. Let me re-run the object finding manually for Ex 3.**
        *   Input:
            
```
            ...
            . . . . . 1 1 .
            . . . . 1 . . .
            . . . . . 1 . .
            ...
            ```

        *   Pixels: `(1, 5)`, `(1, 6)`, `(2, 4)`, `(3, 5)`. There are 4 pixels.
        *   Min Row: 1, Max Row: 3 => Height = 3
        *   Min Col: 4, Max Col: 6 => Width = 3
        *   My manual calculation was correct. The `analyze_example` script seems to have a bug in the object finding part. Let me correct the BFS logic. It stopped after finding the first queue `q`. It should initialize `q` *inside* the loop. No, that's not it. The issue might be `q.pop(0)` vs `q.popleft()` from `collections.deque`, but `list.pop(0)` is BFS. Let's re-check the code: It finds the *first* non-zero pixel `(1,5)` color 1. `q=[(1,5)]`, `visited={(1,5)}`.
        *   Loop 1: pop `(1,5)`. `pixels={(1,5)}`. Neighbors: `(1,6)` is color 1, not visited. Add `(1,6)` to `q` and `visited`. `q=[(1,6)]`, `visited={(1,5), (1,6)}`.
        *   Loop 2: pop `(1,6)`. `pixels={(1,5), (1,6)}`. Neighbors: `(1,5)` visited. `(0,6)`=0. `(2,6)`=0. None added. `q=[]`.
        *   BFS ends. `pixels` only contains `{(1,5), (1,6)}`. The script has a bug! It doesn't correctly find all contiguous pixels. The original code used `collections.deque` and checked neighbors correctly. The `analyze_example` code used a standard list `q` and `q.pop(0)`, which is fine for BFS, but maybe the neighbour check or visited logic was slightly different.

Let's trust the *original code's* `find_colored_object` logic and my manual trace for Example 3, which found 4 pixels and a 3x3 bounding box.

**Recalculating based on Manual Trace for Ex 3:**
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 8x8, Output: 3x6
    *   Object: Blue (1), BBox: height=3, width=3 (Manually verified)
    *   Expected Output Width based on `2*width+1`: 7. Actual is 6.
    *   Separator Column (index 3): `[0, 1, 0]` (from expected output `[[0,1,1,0,1,1],[1,0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,0]]`). Not all pixels are the object color (1).

**New Observations & Hypothesis Refinement:**

1.  **Output Width:** The actual output width is consistently `2 * bbox_width`, not `2 * bbox_width + 1`. This means there is *no* dedicated separator column. The second copy starts *immediately* after the first copy.
2.  **Overlap/Interaction:** If there's no separator, how is the middle part formed? The output grid has width `2 * bbox_width`. The first pattern occupies columns `0` to `width-1`. The second pattern *also* occupies columns `width` to `2*width-1`. They overlap!
    *   Let Pattern P be the `height x width` subgrid.
    *   Output grid O has size `height x (2*width)`.
    *   O `[0:h, 0:w]` = P
    *   O `[0:h, w:2*w]` = P (This overwrites the right part of the first P and the left part of the second P - specifically column `w-1` of the first copy and column `0` of the second copy if placed separately). No, this placement seems wrong.

Let's rethink placement.
Output size is `height x (2*width)`.
Place first pattern P1 at `[0:h, 0:w]`.
Place second pattern P2 at `[0:h, w:2*w]`.

Example 1: BBox h=3, w=3. Output size = 3x6.
Pattern P:

```
0 2 0
2 2 2
2 2 0
```

Place P1 at `[0:3, 0:3]`:

```
0 2 0 . . .
2 2 2 . . .
2 2 0 . . .
```

Place P2 at `[0:3, 3:6]`:

```
. . . 0 2 0
. . . 2 2 2
. . . 2 2 0
```

Combine these two placements into the 3x6 grid:

```
0 2 0 0 2 0
2 2 2 2 2 2
2 2 0 2 2 0
```

This exactly matches the expected output for Example 1!

Let's test Example 2: BBox h=3, w=3. Output size = 3x6.
Pattern P:

```
8 8 0
0 8 0
8 8 8
```

Combine P1 at `[0:3, 0:3]` and P2 at `[0:3, 3:6]`:

```
8 8 0 8 8 0
0 8 0 0 8 0
8 8 8 8 8 8
```

This exactly matches the expected output for Example 2!

Let's test Example 3: BBox h=3, w=3 (using manual trace). Output size = 3x6.
Pattern P:

```
0 1 1
1 0 0
0 1 0
```

Combine P1 at `[0:3, 0:3]` and P2 at `[0:3, 3:6]`:

```
0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 0 0
0 1 0 0 1 0
```

This exactly matches the expected output for Example 3!

**Conclusion:** The transformation involves finding the object, extracting its pattern relative to the bounding box, creating an output grid of size `height x (2*width)`, and placing the pattern twice, side-by-side, filling the output grid completely. There is no separator column; the second pattern starts exactly where the first one ends.

The bug in the `analyze_example` script misled the analysis about the separator column. The actual outputs match the "side-by-side placement" hypothesis perfectly. The previous code failed because it inserted a white column and used the wrong output width (`2*width+1` instead of `2*width`).**General Assessment**

The previous code attempted to solve the task by identifying a single non-white object, extracting its pattern based on the bounding box, and creating an output grid containing two copies of the pattern separated by a single column of white pixels. This approach failed for all provided examples.

The failures indicate inaccuracies in determining the output grid's dimensions and the composition of the space between the duplicated patterns. Specifically:
1.  The calculated output width (`2 * bbox_width + 1`) was incorrect.
2.  The assumption of a *white* separator column was incorrect.

Analysis of the expected outputs reveals a different structure. The output grid's width appears to be exactly twice the width of the object's bounding box (`2 * bbox_width`), and the two copies of the pattern are placed immediately adjacent to each other, with no separator column.

**Metrics**

Based on the task examples and expected outputs (and correcting for the apparent bug in the previous analysis script for Example 3):

| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Object Color | BBox (h, w) | Calculated Output Width (2*w) | Notes                                     |
| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :----------- | :---------- | :---------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| 1       | (8, 8)      | (3, 6)       | 2 (Red)      | (3, 3)      | 6                             | Output matches `height` x `2*width`.    |
| 2       | (8, 8)      | (3, 6)       | 8 (Azure)    | (3, 3)      | 6                             | Output matches `height` x `2*width`.    |
| 3       | (8, 8)      | (3, 6)       | 1 (Blue)     | (3, 3)      | 6                             | Output matches `height` x `2*width`.    |

**Observations:**

*   Each input grid contains a single contiguous non-white object.
*   The output grid's height is equal to the height of the object's minimal bounding box.
*   The output grid's width is equal to twice the width of the object's minimal bounding box.
*   The output grid contains two identical copies of the object's pattern (extracted relative to its bounding box), placed side-by-side with no intervening space or separator.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input:
  - description: A grid containing mostly white pixels (0) and one contiguous object of a single non-white color.
  - properties:
      grid_dimensions: Variable (e.g., 8x8)
      object:
        count: 1
        type: contiguous block of non-white pixels
        color: Any non-white color (e.g., Red, Azure, Blue)
        location: Variable within the grid

Transformation:
  - action: Identify the single contiguous non-white object.
  - action: Determine the object's color.
  - action: Determine the minimal bounding box (min_row, min_col, height, width) enclosing the object.
  - action: Extract the object's pattern as a subgrid of size height x width. This pattern includes only the object's pixels relative to the bounding box's top-left corner, preserving internal white pixels if they exist within the bounding box but are not part of the object itself. *Correction*: The pattern should represent the content *within* the bounding box, using the object's color for object pixels and white (0) for background pixels within that box. Let's refine this: Extract the rectangular region defined by the bounding box from the input grid. Then create a pattern array of size `height x width`, mapping pixels from the object to their color and other pixels within the bounding box to white(0). *Further Refinement*: The simplest way is to extract the `height x width` subgrid defined by the bounding box, and then create the actual pattern relative to the bounding box origin, ensuring only object pixels have the object color.
  - action: Create a new output grid.
    - properties:
        height: Equal to the bounding box height.
        width: Equal to twice the bounding box width (2 * width).
        initial_fill: White (0).
  - action: Place the extracted object pattern into the left half of the output grid.
    - target_location: rows 0 to height-1, columns 0 to width-1.
  - action: Place the *same* object pattern into the right half of the output grid.
    - target_location: rows 0 to height-1, columns width to (2*width)-1.

Output:
  - description: A grid containing two copies of the input object's pattern placed side-by-side.
  - properties:
      grid_dimensions: height x (2 * width) (derived from the object's bounding box)
      content: Two adjacent copies of the object pattern.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Find the single contiguous group of connected non-white pixels (the object) in the input grid. Record its color.
2.  Calculate the minimal bounding box containing all pixels of this object. Let its dimensions be `height` and `width`.
3.  Create an object pattern grid of size `height` x `width`, initially filled with white (0). For each pixel belonging to the object found in step 1, set the corresponding pixel in the pattern grid (relative to the bounding box's top-left corner) to the object's color.
4.  Create a new output grid with dimensions `height` x (`2 * width`), initially filled with white (0).
5.  Copy the `height` x `width` object pattern into the left side of the output grid (columns 0 to `width - 1`).
6.  Copy the `height` x `width` object pattern again into the right side of the output grid (columns `width` to `2 * width - 1`).
7.  Return the resulting output grid.
