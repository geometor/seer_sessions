```python
"""
Identifies all non-white pixels in the input grid, assuming they all share the same color.
Determines the minimal bounding box (height H, width W) containing all these pixels.
Extracts the pattern of these pixels relative to the bounding box.
Creates an output grid of size H x (2*W).
Places this pattern twice into the output grid, side-by-side, filling the grid completely.
The first pattern occupies columns 0 to W-1.
The second pattern occupies columns W to 2*W-1.
