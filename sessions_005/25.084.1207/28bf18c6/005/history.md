Okay, the `tool_code` execution reveals the actual problem!

My manual trace of `find_colored_object` for Example 3 was wrong. Let's re-trace carefully using BFS from the first non-white pixel encountered (1, 5):
Input:

```
. . . . . . . .
. . . . . 1 1 .
. . . . 1 . . .
. . . . . 1 . .
. . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . .
```

1.  Start search. Find `grid[1, 5] == 1`. `color = 1`.
2.  `q = [(1, 5)]`, `visited = {(1, 5)}`, `object_pixels = {}`
3.  Dequeue `(1, 5)`. Add to `object_pixels = {(1, 5)}`. Check neighbors of `(1, 5)`:
    *   `(1, 6)`: `grid[1, 6] == 1` and not visited. Add `(1, 6)` to `q` and `visited`. `q = [(1, 6)]`, `visited = {(1, 5), (1, 6)}`.
    *   `(1, 4)`: `grid[1, 4] == 0`. Skip.
    *   `(2, 5)`: `grid[2, 5] == 0`. Skip.
    *   `(0, 5)`: `grid[0, 5] == 0`. Skip.
4.  Dequeue `(1, 6)`. Add to `object_pixels = {(1, 5), (1, 6)}`. Check neighbors of `(1, 6)`:
    *   `(1, 7)`: `grid[1, 7] == 0`. Skip.
    *   `(1, 5)`: Visited. Skip.
    *   `(2, 6)`: `grid[2, 6] == 0`. Skip.
    *   `(0, 6)`: `grid[0, 6] == 0`. Skip.
5.  `q` is empty. BFS finishes.
6.  Return `object_pixels = {(1, 5), (1, 6)}`, `color = 1`.

*Aha!* The code uses 4-connectivity (`[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`). The blue pixels in Example 3 are *not* connected via 4-connectivity.
*   Pixel (1, 5) is connected to (1, 6).
*   Pixel (2, 4) is isolated from these using 4-connectivity.
*   Pixel (3, 5) is isolated from these using 4-connectivity.

The code finds *only* the first connected component `{(1, 5), (1, 6)}`.
*   Bounding box for `{(1, 5), (1, 6)}`: min_row=1, max_row=1, height=1. min_col=5, max_col=6, width=2. BBox=(1, 5, 1, 2).
*   Pattern (1x2): `[[1, 1]]`.
*   Output grid (1x4): `[[1, 1, 1, 1]]`.

This matches the `tool_code` output and explains the failure reported for Example 3. The original "Transformed Output" `[[1, 1], [1, 1]]` was still wrong in the report, but the actual output `[[1, 1, 1, 1]]` is also incorrect compared to the expected output.

The discrepancy arises because the task implicitly assumes the "object" includes *all* pixels of the same non-white color, even if they aren't connected (or maybe they are connected diagonally, which the current BFS doesn't check). Alternatively, perhaps the concept of "object" isn't based on connectivity but on *all* pixels of the dominant non-white color in the input.

Let's re-examine the examples:
*   Example 1: All red (2) pixels are 4-connected. Code works.
*   Example 2: All azure (8) pixels are 4-connected. Code works.
*   Example 3: The blue (1) pixels are *not* all 4-connected. The pixels are (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (3,5). Code fails because it only finds the component starting at (1,5).

The transformation rule needs refinement. It's not just *a* contiguous object, but likely *all* pixels of a specific color (the single non-white color present in the input).

Revised approach:
1.  Find *all* pixels that are not white (color 0).
2.  Verify that all these non-white pixels have the *same* color. (This seems true for all examples). Let this color be C.
3.  Consider the set of all pixels with color C as the "object".
4.  Find the bounding box of this complete object.
5.  Extract the pattern within the bounding box.
6.  Create the output grid (height x 2*width) and duplicate the pattern side-by-side.

Let's test this revised approach on Example 3:
1.  Non-white pixels: {(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 5)}.
2.  All have color 1 (blue). C = 1.
3.  Object = {(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 5)}.
4.  Bounding box: min_row=1, max_row=3, height=3. min_col=4, max_col=6, width=3. BBox=(1, 4, 3, 3).
5.  Pattern (3x3):
    
```
    0 1 1
    1 0 0
    0 1 0
    ```

6.  Output grid (3x6): Duplicate pattern.
    
```
    0 1 1 0 1 1
    1 0 0 1 0 0
    0 1 0 0 1 0
    ```

This matches the expected output for Example 3. This revised approach also works for Examples 1 and 2, as their objects were already contiguous.

4.  **YAML Facts:** Document the revised understanding.
5.  **Natural Language Program:** Update the program based on the revised understanding.Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the task.

**General Assessment**

The initial hypothesis, based on Example 1, was that the task involves finding a single *contiguous* non-white object, extracting its pattern within its bounding box, and duplicating this pattern side-by-side. This hypothesis held for Examples 1 and 2, where the non-white pixels formed a single 4-connected component.

However, the execution failed on Example 3. The `tool_code` execution confirmed that the provided code, using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) with 4-connectivity, only identified a *subset* of the blue pixels in Example 3 because they were not all connected. The code found the pixels `{(1, 5), (1, 6)}`, calculated a 1x2 bounding box, and produced the output `[[1, 1, 1, 1]]`, which does not match the expected output `[[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]]`.

This indicates the definition of the "object" needs refinement. Instead of a single contiguous component, the relevant "object" appears to be the collection of *all* pixels sharing the unique non-white color present in the input grid.

**Strategy:**
The strategy is to modify the initial step of the transformation:
1.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid.
2.  Confirm they all share the same color.
3.  Treat this complete set of pixels as the object for finding the bounding box and extracting the pattern.
4.  Proceed with duplicating the pattern as before.

**Metrics**

Based on the `tool_code` execution and the revised understanding:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (8, 8)
    *   Object Color: 2 (Red)
    *   Object Pixels: All red pixels (implicitly found correctly by BFS as they are connected)
    *   Bounding Box: (min_row=5, min_col=2, height=3, width=3)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 6)
    *   Result: Correct

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (8, 8)
    *   Object Color: 8 (Azure)
    *   Object Pixels: All azure pixels (implicitly found correctly by BFS as they are connected)
    *   Bounding Box: (min_row=1, min_col=1, height=3, width=3)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 6)
    *   Result: Correct

*   **Example 3 (Revised Analysis):**
    *   Input Shape: (8, 8)
    *   Object Color: 1 (Blue)
    *   Object Pixels: All blue pixels {(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 5)}
    *   Bounding Box: (min_row=1, min_col=4, height=3, width=3)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 6)
    *   Original Code Result: Incorrect (Output `[[1, 1, 1, 1]]` due to finding only a subset of pixels)
    *   Expected Result: Correct based on using *all* blue pixels.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Has a height and width.
    - Contains pixels with colors (0-9), where 0 is white.
    - Contains exactly one non-white color across all examples.
    - Contains a set of pixels of this single non-white color, which constitute the 'object'.

Object:
  Definition: The set of all pixels in the InputGrid that are not white (color 0).
  Properties:
    - All pixels forming the object share the same color (let's call it C).
    - The pixels forming the object are not necessarily contiguous (4-connectivity).
  DerivedProperties:
    - Minimal Bounding Box (MBB): Defined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the object pixels. Let its dimensions be H (height) and W (width).
    - Pattern: An H x W grid representing the object's shape relative to its MBB. It contains color C at positions corresponding to the object pixels and white (0) otherwise.

OutputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Height: Equal to the height (H) of the object's MBB.
    - Width: Equal to twice the width (2*W) of the object's MBB.
    - Content: Composed of two identical copies of the object's Pattern placed side-by-side.
      - The first copy occupies columns 0 to W-1.
      - The second copy occupies columns W to 2*W-1.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid. Let their color be C and the set of their coordinates be P.
2.  Determine the minimal bounding box (MBB) encompassing all pixels in P. Let the dimensions of the MBB be H (height) and W (width), and let the top-left corner be (min_row, min_col).
3.  Create an intermediate pattern grid of size H x W, initially filled with white (0).
4.  For each pixel coordinate (r, c) in P, set the color of the corresponding pixel in the pattern grid at `(r - min_row, c - min_col)` to C.
5.  Create the output grid with dimensions H x (2*W), initially filled with white (0).
6.  Copy the H x W pattern grid into the left half of the output grid (rows 0 to H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
7.  Copy the H x W pattern grid into the right half of the output grid (rows 0 to H-1, columns W to 2*W-1).
8.  Return the resulting output grid.
