Input:
  - description: A grid containing mostly white pixels (0) and one contiguous object of a single non-white color.
  - properties:
      grid_dimensions: Variable (e.g., 8x8)
      object:
        count: 1
        type: contiguous block of non-white pixels
        color: Any non-white color (e.g., Red, Azure, Blue)
        location: Variable within the grid

Transformation:
  - action: Identify the single contiguous non-white object.
  - action: Determine the object's color.
  - action: Determine the minimal bounding box (min_row, min_col, height, width) enclosing the object.
  - action: Extract the object's pattern as a subgrid of size height x width. This pattern includes only the object's pixels relative to the bounding box's top-left corner, preserving internal white pixels if they exist within the bounding box but are not part of the object itself. *Correction*: The pattern should represent the content *within* the bounding box, using the object's color for object pixels and white (0) for background pixels within that box. Let's refine this: Extract the rectangular region defined by the bounding box from the input grid. Then create a pattern array of size `height x width`, mapping pixels from the object to their color and other pixels within the bounding box to white(0). *Further Refinement*: The simplest way is to extract the `height x width` subgrid defined by the bounding box, and then create the actual pattern relative to the bounding box origin, ensuring only object pixels have the object color.
  - action: Create a new output grid.
    - properties:
        height: Equal to the bounding box height.
        width: Equal to twice the bounding box width (2 * width).
        initial_fill: White (0).
  - action: Place the extracted object pattern into the left half of the output grid.
    - target_location: rows 0 to height-1, columns 0 to width-1.
  - action: Place the *same* object pattern into the right half of the output grid.
    - target_location: rows 0 to height-1, columns width to (2*width)-1.

Output:
  - description: A grid containing two copies of the input object's pattern placed side-by-side.
  - properties:
      grid_dimensions: height x (2 * width) (derived from the object's bounding box)
      content: Two adjacent copies of the object pattern.
