The `analyze_example` script seems to have a bug in the object finding part. Let me correct the BFS logic. It stopped after finding the first queue `q`. It should initialize `q` *inside* the loop. No, that's not it. The issue might be `q.pop(0)` vs `q.popleft()` from `collections.deque`, but `list.pop(0)` is BFS. Let's re-check the code: It finds the *first* non-zero pixel `(1,5)` color 1. `q=[(1,5)]`, `visited={(1,5)}`.\n        *   Loop 1: pop `(1,5)`. `pixels={(1,5)}`. Neighbors: `(1,6)` is color 1, not visited. Add `(1,6)` to `q` and `visited`. `q=[(1,6)]`, `visited={(1,5), (1,6)}`.\n        *   Loop 2: pop `(1,6)`. `pixels={(1,5), (1,6)}`. Neighbors: `(1,5)` visited. `(0,6)`=0. `(2,6)`=0. None added. `q=[]`.\n        *   BFS ends. `pixels` only contains `{(1,5), (1,6)}`. The script has a bug! It doesn't correctly find all contiguous pixels. The original code used `collections.deque` and checked neighbors correctly. The `analyze_example` code used a standard list `q` and `q.pop(0)`, which is fine for BFS, but maybe the neighbour check or visited logic was slightly different.\n\nLet's trust the *original code's* `find_colored_object` logic and my manual trace for Example 3, which found 4 pixels and a 3x3 bounding box.\n\n**Recalculating based on Manual Trace for Ex 3:**\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 8x8, Output: 3x6\n    *   Object: Blue (1), BBox: height=3, width=3 (Manually verified)\n    *   Expected Output Width based on `2*width+1`: 7.

Not all pixels are the object color (1).\n\n**New Observations & Hypothesis Refinement:**\n\n1.  **Output Width:** The actual output width is consistently `2 * bbox_width`, not `2 * bbox_width + 1`. This means there is *no* dedicated separator column. The second copy starts *immediately* after the first copy.\n2.  **Overlap/Interaction:** If there's no separator, how is the middle part formed? The output grid has width `2 * bbox_width`. The first pattern occupies columns `0` to `width-1`. The second pattern *also* occupies columns `width` to `2*width-1`. They overlap!\n    *   Let Pattern P be the `height x width` subgrid.\n    *   Output grid O has size `height x (2*width)`.\n    *   O `[0:h, 0:w]` = P\n    *   O `[0:h, w:2*w]` = P (This overwrites the right part of the first P and the left part of the second P - specifically column `w-1` of the first copy and column `0` of the second copy if placed separately). No, this placement seems wrong.\n\nLet's rethink placement.\nOutput size is `height x (2*width)`.\nPlace first pattern P1 at `[0:h, 0:w]`.\nPlace second pattern P2 at `[0:h, w:2*w]`.\n\nExample 1: BBox h=3, w=3.

There is no separator column; the second pattern starts exactly where the first one ends.\n\nThe bug in the `analyze_example` script misled the analysis about the separator column. The actual outputs match the \"side-by-side placement\" hypothesis perfectly. The previous code failed because it inserted a white column and used the wrong output width (`2*width+1` instead of `2*width`).**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code attempted to solve the task by identifying a single non-white object, extracting its pattern based on the bounding box, and creating an output grid containing two copies of the pattern separated by a single column of white pixels. This approach failed for all provided examples.\n\nThe failures indicate inaccuracies in determining the output grid's dimensions and the composition of the space between the duplicated patterns. Specifically:\n1.  The calculated output width (`2 * bbox_width + 1`) was incorrect.\n2.  The assumption of a *white* separator column was incorrect.\n\nAnalysis of the expected outputs reveals a different structure. The output grid's width appears to be exactly twice the width of the object's bounding box (`2 * bbox_width`), and the two copies of the pattern are placed immediately adjacent to each other, with no separator column.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nBased on the task examples and expected outputs (and correcting for the apparent bug in the previous analysis script for Example 3):\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Object Color | BBox (h, w) | Calculated Output Width (2*w) | Notes                                     |\n| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :----------- | :---------- | :---------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | (8, 8)      | (3, 6)       | 2 (Red)      | (3, 3)      | 6                             | Output matches `height` x `2*width`.    |\n| 2       | (8, 8)      | (3, 6)       | 8 (Azure)    | (3, 3)      | 6                             | Output matches `height` x `2*width`.    |\n| 3       | (8, 8)      | (3, 6)       | 1 (Blue)     | (3, 3)      | 6                             | Output matches `height` x `2*width`.    |\n\n**Observations:**\n\n*   Each input grid contains a single contiguous non-white object.\n*   The output grid's height is equal to the height of the object's minimal bounding box.\n*   The output grid's width is equal to twice the width of the object's minimal bounding box.\n*   The output grid contains two identical copies of the object's pattern (extracted relative to its bounding box), placed side-by-side with no intervening space or separator.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
