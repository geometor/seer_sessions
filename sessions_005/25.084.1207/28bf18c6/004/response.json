The blue pixels in Example 3 are *not* connected via 4-connectivity.\n*   Pixel (1, 5) is connected to (1, 6).\n*   Pixel (2, 4) is isolated from these using 4-connectivity.\n*   Pixel (3, 5) is isolated from these using 4-connectivity.\n\nThe code finds *only* the first connected component `{(1, 5), (1, 6)}`.\n*   Bounding box for `{(1, 5), (1, 6)}`: min_row=1, max_row=1, height=1. min_col=5, max_col=6, width=2. BBox=(1, 5, 1, 2).\n*   Pattern (1x2): `[[1, 1]]`.\n*   Output grid (1x4): `[[1, 1, 1, 1]]`.\n\nThis matches the `tool_code` output and explains the failure reported for Example 3. The original \"Transformed Output\" `[[1, 1], [1, 1]]` was still wrong in the report, but the actual output `[[1, 1, 1, 1]]` is also incorrect compared to the expected output.\n\nThe discrepancy arises because the task implicitly assumes the \"object\" includes *all* pixels of the same non-white color, even if they aren't connected (or maybe they are connected diagonally, which the current BFS doesn't check). Alternatively, perhaps the concept of \"object\" isn't based on connectivity but on *all* pixels of the dominant non-white color in the input.\n\nLet's re-examine the examples:\n*   Example 1: All red (2) pixels are 4-connected. Code works.\n*   Example 2: All azure (8) pixels are 4-connected. Code works.\n*   Example 3: The blue (1) pixels are *not* all 4-connected. The pixels are (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (3,5). Code fails because it only finds the component starting at (1,5).\n\nThe transformation rule needs refinement. It's not just *a* contiguous object, but likely *all* pixels of a specific color (the single non-white color present in the input).\n\nRevised approach:\n1.  Find *all* pixels that are not white (color 0).\n2.  Verify that all these non-white pixels have the *same* color. (This seems true for all examples). Let this color be C.\n3.  Consider the set of all pixels with color C as the \"object\".\n4.  Find the bounding box of this complete object.\n5.  Extract the pattern within the bounding box.\n6.  Create the output grid (height x 2*width) and duplicate the pattern side-by-side.\n\nLet's test this revised approach on Example 3:\n1.  Non-white pixels: {(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 5)}.\n2.  All have color 1 (blue). C = 1.\n3.  Object = {(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 5)}.\n4.  Bounding box: min_row=1, max_row=3, height=3. min_col=4, max_col=6, width=3. BBox=(1, 4, 3, 3).\n5.

This revised approach also works for Examples 1 and 2, as their objects were already contiguous.\n\n4.  **YAML Facts:** Document the revised understanding.\n5.  **Natural Language Program:** Update the program based on the revised understanding.Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the task.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial hypothesis, based on Example 1, was that the task involves finding a single *contiguous* non-white object, extracting its pattern within its bounding box, and duplicating this pattern side-by-side. This hypothesis held for Examples 1 and 2, where the non-white pixels formed a single 4-connected component.\n\nHowever, the execution failed on Example 3. The `tool_code` execution confirmed that the provided code, using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) with 4-connectivity, only identified a *subset* of the blue pixels in Example 3 because they were not all connected. The code found the pixels `{(1, 5), (1, 6)}`, calculated a 1x2 bounding box, and produced the output `[[1, 1, 1, 1]]`, which does not match the expected output `[[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]]`.\n\nThis indicates the definition of the \"object\" needs refinement. Instead of a single contiguous component, the relevant \"object\" appears to be the collection of *all* pixels sharing the unique non-white color present in the input grid.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe strategy is to modify the initial step of the transformation:\n1.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid.\n2.  Confirm they all share the same color.\n3.  Treat this complete set of pixels as the object for finding the bounding box and extracting the pattern.\n4.  Proceed with duplicating the pattern as before.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nBased on the `tool_code` execution and the revised understanding:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (8, 8)\n    *   Object Color: 2 (Red)\n    *   Object Pixels: All red pixels (implicitly found correctly by BFS as they are connected)\n    *   Bounding Box: (min_row=5, min_col=2, height=3, width=3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 6)\n    *   Result: Correct\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (8, 8)\n    *   Object Color: 8 (Azure)\n    *   Object Pixels: All azure pixels (implicitly found correctly by BFS as they are connected)\n    *   Bounding Box: (min_row=1, min_col=1, height=3, width=3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 6)\n    *   Result: Correct\n\n*   **Example 3 (Revised Analysis):**\n    *   Input Shape: (8, 8)\n    *   Object Color: 1 (Blue)\n    *   Object Pixels: All blue pixels {(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 5)}\n    *   Bounding Box: (min_row=1, min_col=4, height=3, width=3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 6)\n    *   Original Code Result: Incorrect (Output `[[1, 1, 1, 1]]` due to finding only a subset of pixels)\n    *   Expected Result: Correct based on using *all* blue pixels.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
