InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Has a height and width.
    - Contains pixels with colors (0-9), where 0 is white.
    - Contains exactly one non-white color across all examples.
    - Contains a set of pixels of this single non-white color, which constitute the 'object'.

Object:
  Definition: The set of all pixels in the InputGrid that are not white (color 0).
  Properties:
    - All pixels forming the object share the same color (let's call it C).
    - The pixels forming the object are not necessarily contiguous (4-connectivity).
  DerivedProperties:
    - Minimal Bounding Box (MBB): Defined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the object pixels. Let its dimensions be H (height) and W (width).
    - Pattern: An H x W grid representing the object's shape relative to its MBB. It contains color C at positions corresponding to the object pixels and white (0) otherwise.

OutputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Height: Equal to the height (H) of the object's MBB.
    - Width: Equal to twice the width (2*W) of the object's MBB.
    - Content: Composed of two identical copies of the object's Pattern placed side-by-side.
      - The first copy occupies columns 0 to W-1.
      - The second copy occupies columns W to 2*W-1.
