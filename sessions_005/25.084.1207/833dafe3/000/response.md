Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Size:** In both examples, the output grid dimensions are exactly double the input grid dimensions (height and width).
    *   `train_1`: Input 4x4 -> Output 8x8
    *   `train_2`: Input 3x3 -> Output 6x6
2.  **Structure:** The output grid appears to be composed of four distinct quadrants, each the same size as the original input grid.
3.  **Relationship between Quadrants and Input:** By comparing the input grid with the four quadrants of the output grid, we can observe relationships involving reflections (flipping).
    *   Let the input grid be `I`.
    *   Let `H(I)` be the input grid flipped horizontally (left-right mirror).
    *   Let `V(I)` be the input grid flipped vertically (top-bottom mirror).
    *   Let `HV(I)` be the input grid flipped both horizontally and vertically (equivalent to 180-degree rotation).
4.  **Quadrant Mapping:** Observing `train_1` and `train_2` suggests the following consistent mapping:
    *   **Top-Left Quadrant:** `HV(I)` (flipped horizontally and vertically)
    *   **Top-Right Quadrant:** `V(I)` (flipped vertically)
    *   **Bottom-Left Quadrant:** `H(I)` (flipped horizontally)
    *   **Bottom-Right Quadrant:** `I` (original input)
5.  **Content:** The colors (pixel values) are preserved during the reflections and tiling; no new colors are introduced, and existing colors are not changed.

  - quadrant: Bottom-Left (rows H..2H-1, cols 0..W-1)
    source: Horizontal Flip (H) of input_grid
  - quadrant: Bottom-Right (rows H..2H-1, cols W..2W-1)

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input grid. Let its height be `H` and width be `W`.
2.  Create an empty output grid with height `2*H` and width `2*W`.
3.  Generate the horizontally flipped version of the input grid (`H_flipped`).
4.  Generate the vertically flipped version of the input grid (`V_flipped`).
5.  Generate the version flipped both horizontally and vertically (`HV_flipped`). This can be done by flipping `H_flipped` vertically or flipping `V_flipped` horizontally.
6.  Copy the pixels from `HV_flipped` into the top-left quadrant of the output grid (rows `0` to `H-1`, columns `0` to `W-1`).
7.  Copy the pixels from `V_flipped` into the top-right quadrant of the output grid (rows `0` to `H-1`, columns `W` to `2*W-1`).
8.  Copy the pixels from `H_flipped` into the bottom-left quadrant of the output grid (rows `H` to `2*H-1`, columns `0` to `W-1`).
9.  Copy the pixels from the original input grid into the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid (rows `H` to `2*H-1`, columns `W` to `2*W-1`).
10. Return the completed output grid.
