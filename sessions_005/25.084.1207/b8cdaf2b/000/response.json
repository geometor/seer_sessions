The output grid is identical to the input grid, except for the addition of new pixels of a specific color in the upper part of the grid. The original structure remains unchanged.\n2.  **Key Element - Emitter:** In each input, there's a distinct horizontal segment (which can be just one pixel wide) of a single color (blue, green, or yellow in the examples) positioned directly above pixels of a *different* color. This segment appears to be the key element triggering the transformation. Let's call this the \"emitter\" segment.\n3.  **Emitter Properties:** The emitter segment has a specific color, a width, and a central position (row `y_c`, column `x_c`).\n4.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation involves adding new pixels to the grid. The color of these new pixels is the same as the emitter segment's color. The positions of these new pixels are determined relative to the center of the emitter segment `(y_c, x_c)`.\n5.  **Pattern Dependency:** The specific pattern (relative coordinates) of the added pixels depends on both the *color* and the *width* of the emitter segment.\n    *   Example 1: Blue (1), Width 3 -> Offsets `(-2, -2), (-2, +2)` relative to center.\n    *   Example 2: Green (3), Width 1 -> Offsets `(-3, -2), (-3, +2), (-2, -1), (-2, +1)` relative to center.\n    *   Example 3: Yellow (4), Width 3 -> Offsets `(-3, -3), (-3, +3), (-2, -2), (-2, +2)` relative to center.\n    *   Example 4: Yellow (4), Width 1 -> Offsets `(-2, -1), (-2, +1)` relative to center.\n6.  **Output Grid:** The output grid retains all original pixels from the input grid and adds the newly generated pixels, potentially overwriting background (white) pixels.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

This is the \"emitter segment\".\n    *   Determine the emitter segment's color (`emitter_color`), its row index (`emitter_y`), its starting column (`emitter_x_min`), and its ending column (`emitter_x_max`).\n2.  **Calculate Emitter Properties:**\n    *   Calculate the width of the emitter segment: `emitter_width = emitter_x_max - emitter_x_min + 1`.\n    *   Calculate the center column index of the emitter segment: `emitter_center_x = (emitter_x_min + emitter_x_max) / 2` (integer division or floor might be appropriate if width is even, though examples only show odd widths). Use `emitter_center_x = floor((emitter_x_min + emitter_x_max) / 2)`. Let the center coordinates be `(emitter_y, emitter_center_x)`.\n3.  **Determine the Offset Pattern:**\n    *   Based on the `emitter_color` and `emitter_width`, select the corresponding set of relative coordinate offsets `{(dy, dx)}`:\n        *   If `emitter_color` is 1 (blue) and `emitter_width` is 3: use offsets `{(-2, -2), (-2, +2)}`.\n        *   If `emitter_color` is 3 (green) and `emitter_width` is 1: use offsets `{(-3, -2), (-3, +2), (-2, -1), (-2, +1)}`.\n        *   If `emitter_color` is 4 (yellow) and `emitter_width` is 3: use offsets `{(-3, -3), (-3, +3), (-2, -2), (-2, +2)}`.\n        *   If `emitter_color` is 4 (yellow) and `emitter_width` is 1: use offsets `{(-2, -1), (-2, +1)}`.\n        *   (Assume these are the only necessary combinations based on training data).\n4.  **Create the Output Grid:**\n    *   Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    *   For each offset `(dy, dx)` in the selected set:\n        *   Calculate the target coordinates: `target_y = emitter_y + dy`, `target_x = emitter_center_x + dx`.\n        *   Check if the `target_y` and `target_x` are within the bounds of the grid dimensions.\n        *   If they are within bounds, set the pixel at `(target_y, target_x)` in the output grid to the `emitter_color`.\n5.  **Return the Output Grid.**"
