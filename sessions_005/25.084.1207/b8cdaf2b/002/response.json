            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code consistently failed across all training examples, producing outputs identical to the inputs. The failure analysis indicates that the `find_emitter_segment` function incorrectly identified the 'emitter'. The original logic assumed the emitter was the *upper* segment in a vertical pair of different non-background colored pixels. However, the input-output transformations clearly show that the *lower* segment's color is propagated, and the new pixels appear relative to this lower segment.\n\nThe core issue lies in the definition and identification of the \"emitter object\". The strategy is to redefine the emitter identification logic:\n1.  Locate the \"trigger\" condition: a non-background pixel `C1` at `(r, c)` directly above a *different* non-background pixel `C2` at `(r+1, c)`.\n2.  Identify the emitter: The emitter is the full horizontal contiguous segment of color `C2` containing the pixel at `(r+1, c)`.\n3.  Recalculate emitter properties (color `C2`, width, center coordinates).\n4.  Apply the predefined offset patterns based on the *correct* emitter's color and width. The existing offset patterns seem consistent with the examples once the emitter is correctly identified.\n\n## Metrics and Observations\n\nLet's analyze each example based on the revised understanding:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Size: 5x5\n*   Output Size: 5x5\n*   Trigger: Pixels like `grid[3, 1]=6` (magenta) above `grid[4, 1]=1` (blue).\n*   Emitter Segment: `[1, 1, 1]` (blue) at row 4, columns 1-3.\n*   Emitter Properties: Color=1 (blue), Width=3, Center=(4, 2).\n*   Emitted Pixels: Color=1 (blue) at (2, 0) and (2, 4).\n*   Relative Offsets from (4, 2): `(-2, -2)`, `(-2, +2)`.\n*   Code Output Analysis: Failed because it likely identified magenta (6) at row 3 as the emitter, for which no pattern is defined, or failed to find any segment meeting its criteria.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Size: 5x5\n*   Output Size: 5x5\n*   Trigger: `grid[3, 2]=8` (azure) above `grid[4, 2]=3` (green).\n*   Emitter Segment: `[3]` (green) at row 4, column 2.\n*   Emitter Properties: Color=3 (green), Width=1, Center=(4, 2).\n*   Emitted Pixels: Color=3 (green) at (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3).\n*   Relative Offsets from (4, 2): `(-3, -2)`, `(-3, +2)`, `(-2, -1)`, `(-2, +1)`.\n*   Code Output Analysis: Failed because it likely identified azure (8) at row 3 as the emitter.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input Size: 7x7\n*   Output Size: 7x7\n*   Trigger: Pixels like `grid[5, 2]=2` (red) above `grid[6, 2]=4` (yellow).\n*   Emitter Segment: `[4, 4, 4]` (yellow) at row 6, columns 2-4.\n*   Emitter Properties: Color=4 (yellow), Width=3, Center=(6, 3).\n*   Emitted Pixels: Color=4 (yellow) at (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 5).\n*   Relative Offsets from (6, 3): `(-3, -3)`, `(-3, +3)`, `(-2, -2)`, `(-2, +2)`.\n*   Code Output Analysis: Failed because it likely identified red (2) at row 5 as the emitter.\n\n**Example 4:**\n*   Input Size: 3x3\n*   Output Size: 3x3\n*   Trigger: `grid[1, 1]=2` (red) above `grid[2, 1]=4` (yellow).\n*   Emitter Segment: `[4]` (yellow) at row 2, column 1.\n*   Emitter Properties: Color=4 (yellow), Width=1, Center=(2, 1).\n*   Emitted Pixels: Color=4 (yellow) at (0, 0) and (0, 2).\n*   Relative Offsets from (2, 1): `(-2, -1)`, `(-2, +1)`.\n*   Code Output Analysis: Failed because it likely identified red (2) at row 1 as the emitter.\n\n## Facts YAML\n\n"

Find the maximal horizontal contiguous segment composed entirely of color `C2` that includes `P_lower`. This is the `emitter_segment`. Assume there is only one such unique segment in the grid.\n3.  **Determine Emitter Properties:** Record the `emitter_segment`'s color (`emitter_color = C2`), its row index (`emitter_y = r+1`), its starting and ending column indices (`emitter_x_min`, `emitter_x_max`). Calculate its width (`emitter_width = emitter_x_max - emitter_x_min + 1`) and its center column index (`emitter_center_x = (emitter_x_min + emitter_x_max) // 2`).\n4.  **Select Offset Pattern:** Choose a predefined set of `(dy, dx)` coordinate offsets based on the `emitter_color` and `emitter_width`. The known patterns are:\n    *   If `emitter_color` is Blue (1) and `emitter_width` is 3: `{(-2, -2), (-2, +2)}`\n    *   If `emitter_color` is Green (3) and `emitter_width` is 1: `{(-3, -2), (-3, +2), (-2, -1), (-2, +1)}`\n    *   If `emitter_color` is Yellow (4) and `emitter_width` is 3: `{(-3, -3), (-3, +3), (-2, -2), (-2, +2)}`\n    *   If `emitter_color` is Yellow (4) and `emitter_width` is 1: `{(-2, -1), (-2, +1)}`\n5.  **Generate Output:** Create a copy of the input grid. For each offset `(dy, dx)` in the selected pattern:\n    *   Calculate the target coordinates: `target_y = emitter_y + dy`, `target_x = emitter_center_x + dx`.\n    *   Check if `target_y` and `target_x` are within the grid boundaries.\n    *   If within bounds, set the pixel at `(target_y, target_x)` in the output grid to the `emitter_color`.\n6.  **Return Output:** Return the modified grid. If no emitter segment is found, return the original input grid."
