Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this ARC task.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Size Transformation**: The input grids are consistently 3x3, while the output grids are consistently 9x9. This indicates a scaling factor of 3 in both height and width.
2.  **Output Structure**: The 9x9 output grid appears to be structured as a 3x3 grid of smaller 3x3 subgrids.
3.  **Content Placement**: The original 3x3 input grid is copied into *some* of these 3x3 subgrid locations within the larger 9x9 output grid.
4.  **Default Content**: Subgrids in the output that do *not* contain a copy of the input grid are filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
5.  **Placement Rule**: The decision of *where* to place the copies of the input grid within the output's 3x3 supergrid seems determined by the content of the input grid itself. Specifically, it looks like a particular color within the input grid acts as a "marker" or "key".
6.  **Identifying the Key**: By comparing the input grid cell colors with the positions of the copied input grids in the output, a pattern emerges:
    *   In Example 1, the color gray (5) appears at input positions (0,1), (1,2), (2,0), and (2,1). The output grid has copies of the input placed in the corresponding subgrid locations: (0,1), (1,2), (2,0), and (2,1).
    *   In Example 2, the color orange (7) appears at input positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (2,2). The output grid has copies placed at subgrid locations (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (2,2).
    *   This pattern holds for Examples 3 (key color maroon=9) and 4 (key color azure=8).
7.  **Key Color Determination**: In all provided examples, the "key color" used to determine placement is the *most frequent non-white* color in the input grid.

## Facts


```yaml
Input_Grid:
  Type: 2D array of integers (colors)
  Properties:
    - Size: H x W (observed as 3x3 in examples)
    - Content: Contains various colors (0-9)

Output_Grid:
  Type: 2D array of integers (colors)
  Properties:
    - Size: (3*H) x (3*W) (observed as 9x9 in examples)
    - Structure: Composed of a 3x3 arrangement of subgrids, each of size H x W.
    - Content: Contains either copies of the Input_Grid or subgrids filled entirely with white (0).

Transformation:
  Action: Mapping Input_Grid content to Output_Grid structure.
  Rule:
    1. Identify the 'key color' in the Input_Grid.
       - Method: Find the most frequent non-white color in the Input_Grid.
    2. Create the Output_Grid, initialized with white (0).
    3. Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the Input_Grid.
    4. If the color of Input_Grid cell (r, c) matches the 'key color':
       - Copy the entire Input_Grid into the subgrid region of the Output_Grid starting at coordinates (r * H, c * W).
    5. If the color does not match the 'key color', the corresponding subgrid in the Output_Grid remains white (0).

Relationships:
  - Output grid size is 3 times the input grid size in each dimension.
  - Each cell (r, c) in the input grid corresponds to a subgrid region starting at (r*H, c*W) in the output grid.
  - The color value of an input cell determines the content of its corresponding output subgrid region based on whether it matches the 'key color'.
  - The 'key color' is derived from the frequency analysis of colors within the input grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the height (`H`) and width (`W`) of the input grid.
2.  Calculate the frequency of each non-white color present in the input grid.
3.  Identify the 'key color' as the color with the highest frequency among the non-white colors. (Assume no ties, or define a tie-breaking rule if necessary, e.g., lowest color index). If the input grid contains only white pixels, the output should be a (3*H) x (3*W) grid of white pixels.
4.  Create a new output grid with dimensions `(3 * H)` by `(3 * W)`, and initialize all its cells to white (0).
5.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid using row index `r` (from 0 to `H-1`) and column index `c` (from 0 to `W-1`).
6.  For each input cell `(r, c)`, check if its color is equal to the identified 'key color'.
7.  If the color of input cell `(r, c)` matches the 'key color', then copy the *entire* original input grid into the output grid. The top-left corner of this copied grid should be placed at the output grid coordinates `(r * H, c * W)`.
8.  If the color of input cell `(r, c)` does *not* match the 'key color', leave the corresponding `H x W` subgrid region in the output grid (starting at `(r * H, c * W)`) filled with white (0).
9.  Return the completed output grid.
