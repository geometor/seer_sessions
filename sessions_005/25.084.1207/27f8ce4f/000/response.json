            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this ARC task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Size Transformation**: The input grids are consistently 3x3, while the output grids are consistently 9x9. This indicates a scaling factor of 3 in both height and width.\n2.  **Output Structure**: The 9x9 output grid appears to be structured as a 3x3 grid of smaller 3x3 subgrids.\n3.  **Content Placement**: The original 3x3 input grid is copied into *some* of these 3x3 subgrid locations within the larger 9x9 output grid.\n4.  **Default Content**: Subgrids in the output that do *not* contain a copy of the input grid are filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).\n5.  **Placement Rule**: The decision of *where* to place the copies of the input grid within the output's 3x3 supergrid seems determined by the content of the input grid itself. Specifically, it looks like a particular color within the input grid acts as a \"marker\" or \"key\".\n6.  **Identifying the Key**: By comparing the input grid cell colors with the positions of the copied input grids in the output, a pattern emerges:\n    *   In Example 1, the color gray (5) appears at input positions (0,1), (1,2), (2,0), and (2,1). The output grid has copies of the input placed in the corresponding subgrid locations: (0,1), (1,2), (2,0), and (2,1).\n    *   In Example 2, the color orange (7) appears at input positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (2,2). The output grid has copies placed at subgrid locations (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (2,2).\n    *   This pattern holds for Examples 3 (key color maroon=9) and 4 (key color azure=8).\n7.  **Key Color Determination**: In all provided examples, the \"key color\" used to determine placement is the *most frequent non-white* color in the input grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Calculate the frequency of each non-white color present in the input grid.\n3.  Identify the 'key color' as the color with the highest frequency among the non-white colors. (Assume no ties, or define a tie-breaking rule if necessary, e.g., lowest color index). If the input grid contains only white pixels, the output should be a (3*H) x (3*W) grid of white pixels.\n4.  Create a new output grid with dimensions `(3 * H)` by `(3 * W)`, and initialize all its cells to white (0).\n5.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid using row index `r` (from 0 to `H-1`) and column index `c` (from 0 to `W-1`).\n6.  For each input cell `(r, c)`, check if its color is equal to the identified 'key color'.\n7.  If the color of input cell `(r, c)` matches the 'key color', then copy the *entire* original input grid into the output grid.
