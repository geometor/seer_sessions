Input_Grid:
  Type: 2D array of integers (colors)
  Properties:
    - Size: H x W (observed as 3x3 in examples)
    - Content: Contains various colors (0-9)

Output_Grid:
  Type: 2D array of integers (colors)
  Properties:
    - Size: (3*H) x (3*W) (observed as 9x9 in examples)
    - Structure: Composed of a 3x3 arrangement of subgrids, each of size H x W.
    - Content: Contains either copies of the Input_Grid or subgrids filled entirely with white (0).

Transformation:
  Action: Mapping Input_Grid content to Output_Grid structure.
  Rule:
    1. Identify the 'key color' in the Input_Grid.
       - Method: Find the most frequent non-white color in the Input_Grid.
    2. Create the Output_Grid, initialized with white (0).
    3. Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the Input_Grid.
    4. If the color of Input_Grid cell (r, c) matches the 'key color':
       - Copy the entire Input_Grid into the subgrid region of the Output_Grid starting at coordinates (r * H, c * W).
    5. If the color does not match the 'key color', the corresponding subgrid in the Output_Grid remains white (0).

Relationships:
  - Output grid size is 3 times the input grid size in each dimension.
  - Each cell (r, c) in the input grid corresponds to a subgrid region starting at (r*H, c*W) in the output grid.
  - The color value of an input cell determines the content of its corresponding output subgrid region based on whether it matches the 'key color'.
  - The 'key color' is derived from the frequency analysis of colors within the input grid.
