task_description: Reflect all azure pixels based on a condition determined by the overall bounding box of azure pixels.

observations:
  - The transformation focuses exclusively on the azure (8) pixels. Other pixels, like yellow (4), remain unchanged.
  - The output grid contains the original azure pixels plus new azure pixels representing a horizontal reflection.
  - The reflection logic depends on the overall bounding box encompassing *all* azure pixels in the input grid.
  - Let the overall bounding box be (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col).
  - The condition for reflection direction is determined by checking the pixel value at the coordinate (max_row, center_col_in_bbox), where center_col_in_bbox = min_col + floor((max_col - min_col) / 2).

reflection_rules:
  - rule: If the pixel at (max_row, center_col_in_bbox) is azure (8):
      action: Reflect all original azure pixels horizontally across the axis x = max_col + 0.5.
      reflection_formula: reflected_col = (2 * max_col) + 1 - original_col
      example_applies: 1
  - rule: If the pixel at (max_row, center_col_in_bbox) is NOT azure (e.g., white 0):
      action: Reflect all original azure pixels horizontally across the axis x = min_col - 0.5.
      reflection_formula: reflected_col = (2 * min_col) - 1 - original_col
      example_applies: 2, 3

output_grid_construction:
  - Create a copy of the input grid.
  - For each original azure pixel (r, c):
      - Calculate its reflected column `reflected_c` based on the applicable reflection rule.
      - The reflected row `reflected_r` is the same as the original row `r`.
      - If the reflected coordinate (reflected_r, reflected_c) is within the grid boundaries, set the color of that pixel in the output grid to azure (8).

confirmed_metrics:
  - Example 1:
      azure_pixels: 7
      overall_bbox: (0, 2, 3, 5)
      center_col: 4
      check_coord: (2, 4)
      check_value: 8
      reflection: Right (axis x=5.5)
  - Example 2:
      azure_pixels: 5
      overall_bbox: (0, 2, 3, 5)
      center_col: 4
      check_coord: (2, 4)
      check_value: 0
      reflection: Left (axis x=2.5)
  - Example 3:
      azure_pixels: 4
      overall_bbox: (0, 2, 3, 5)
      center_col: 4
      check_coord: (2, 4)
      check_value: 0
      reflection: Left (axis x=2.5)
