            "text": "**CRITICAL NEW INFORMATION:** The `find_objects` function found *multiple* azure objects in examples 2 and 3!\n\n*   Example 2 Input: `[[0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0]...]`\n    *   Object 1: (0, 3)\n    *   Object 2: (0, 5), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5)\n    My initial visual inspection was wrong. These are separate.\n\n*   Example 3 Input: `[[0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0],[0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]...]`\n    *   Object 1: (0, 3)\n    *   Object 2: (1, 4), (1, 5)\n    *   Object 3: (2, 3)\n    Again, separate objects.\n\nThe original code only processed the *first* object found: `azure_object_coords = azure_objects[0]`. This explains the failure! The reflection logic needs to be applied to *all* azure objects, or there's a different rule altogether.\n\nLet's re-examine the examples based on multiple objects:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input has one contiguous azure object.\n    *   Bbox (0, 2, 3, 5). Center col 4. Pixel (2, 4) is 8 (azure).\n    *   Reflect right. Expected output matches. Logic holds for single objects.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input has two azure objects: Obj1={(0, 3)}, Obj2={(0, 5), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5)}.\n    *   Expected Output shows reflection of *both* objects to the *left*.\n        *   Obj1 (0, 3) reflects to (0, 2). Axis `x = 2.5`. `2*3 - 3 - 1 = 2`. Correct.\n        *   Obj2 (0, 5) reflects to (0, 0). Axis `x = 2.5`. `2*3 - 5 - 1 = 0`. Correct.\n        *   Obj2 (1, 4) reflects to (1, 1). Axis `x = 2.5`. `2*3 - 4 - 1 = 1`. Correct.\n        *   Obj2 (1, 5) reflects to (1, 0). Axis `x = 2.5`. `2*3 - 5 - 1 = 0`. Correct.\n        *   Obj2 (2, 5) reflects to (2, 0). Axis `x = 2.5`. `2*3 - 5 - 1 = 0`. Correct.\n    *   Why reflect left? The previous logic relied on the bounding box of a *single* object. What defines the reflection direction when there are multiple objects?\n    *   Maybe we take the bounding box of *all* azure pixels combined?\n        *   All azure coords: (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5).\n        *   Combined Bbox: min_r=0, max_r=2, min_c=3, max_c=5.\n        *   Center col: `3 + (5-3)//2 = 4`.\n        *   Pixel to check: (max_r, center_c) = (2, 4). Input[2, 4] = 0 (white).\n        *   Condition implies reflect *left*. Axis `x = min_c - 0.5 = 2.5`.\n    *   This seems consistent! The rule might be: Find the bounding box enclosing *all* azure pixels. Determine the center column within this *overall* bounding box. Check the pixel at the bottom row of this overall bounding box at the center column. If azure, reflect *all* azure objects right relative to the *overall* max_col. If not azure, reflect *all* azure objects left relative to the *overall* min_col.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input has three azure objects: Obj1={(0, 3)}, Obj2={(1, 4), (1, 5)}, Obj3={(2, 3)}.\n    *   Expected Output shows reflection of *all* objects to the *left*.\n        *   Obj1 (0, 3) -> (0, 2). Axis `x = 2.5`. `2*3 - 3 - 1 = 2`. Correct.\n        *   Obj2 (1, 4) -> (1, 1). Axis `x = 2.5`. `2*3 - 4 - 1 = 1`. Correct.\n        *   Obj2 (1, 5) -> (1, 0). Axis `x = 2.5`. `2*3 - 5 - 1 = 0`. Correct.\n        *   Obj3 (2, 3) -> (2, 2). Axis `x = 2.5`. `2*3 - 3 - 1 = 2`. Correct.\n    *   Let's test the combined bounding box hypothesis:\n        *   All azure coords: (0, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3).\n        *   Combined Bbox: min_r=0, max_r=2, min_c=3, max_c=5.\n        *   Center col: `3 + (5-3)//2 = 4`.\n        *   Pixel to check: (max_r, center_c) = (2, 4). Input[2, 4] = 0 (white).\n        *   Condition implies reflect *left*. Axis `x = min_c - 0.5 = 2.5`.\n    *   This is also consistent!\n\n**Revised Understanding:** The transformation applies to *all* azure pixels collectively. The reflection direction (left or right) and the axis of reflection are determined by the bounding box that encloses *all* azure pixels in the input grid.\n\n**Final Check of Logic:**\n1.  Find all azure (8) pixels in the input grid. If none, return the grid unchanged.\n2.  Determine the overall bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) containing all azure pixels.\n3.  Calculate the center column index within this overall bounding box: `center_c = min_c + (max_c - min_c) // 2`.\n4.  Check the color of the pixel at the bottom-center position of the overall bounding box: `pixel_color = input_grid[max_r, center_c]`.\n5.  If `pixel_color` is azure (8):\n    *   Reflect *each* original azure pixel horizontally across the vertical line immediately to the right of the *overall* bounding box (axis `x = max_c + 0.5`). The reflected column is `reflected_c = 2 * max_c - c + 1`.\n6.  If `pixel_color` is *not* azure (e.g., white 0):\n    *   Reflect *each* original azure pixel horizontally across the vertical line immediately to the left of the *overall* bounding box (axis `x = min_c - 0.5`). The reflected column is `reflected_c = 2 * min_c - c - 1`.\n7.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n8.  For each calculated reflected coordinate (reflected_r, reflected_c) that falls within the grid boundaries, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to azure (8). Note that original azure pixels remain.\n\nThis revised logic now correctly explains all three examples. The key was realizing the `find_objects` function separating pixels that looked contiguous and updating the logic to consider *all* azure pixels together for determining the reflection parameters.Okay, let's refine our understanding based on the execution results.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial code was based on the assumption of a single contiguous azure object, derived from observing only the first example. The execution results clearly show this assumption was incorrect, as examples 2 and 3 contain multiple, non-contiguous azure pixels/objects. The code failed because it only considered the first object found by the `find_objects` function.\n\nThe critical insight comes from the tool execution (`code_output`) which explicitly states that multiple azure \"objects\" (as defined by the BFS search for contiguous blocks) were found in examples 2 and 3. The expected outputs, however, show a single, coherent reflection operation being applied to *all* azure pixels present in the input.\n\nThe strategy is to revise the logic to consider all azure pixels collectively to determine the reflection parameters (direction and axis) and then apply this reflection to every azure pixel individually.\n\n**Metrics**\n"
