**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (6x9 in all examples).
2.  **Colors & Objects:** The grids contain a white background (0), an azure object (8), and a yellow object (4). Both objects are contiguous blocks of single colors.
3.  **Static Element:** The yellow object (a 'T' shape) remains completely unchanged in position and form between the input and output grids in all examples.
4.  **Dynamic Element:** The azure object undergoes a transformation. The original azure object pixels remain in the output, but additional azure pixels are added.
5.  **Transformation Type:** The added pixels form a horizontal reflection of the original azure object.
6.  **Reflection Axis:** The key challenge is determining the vertical axis of reflection.
    *   In Example 1, the reflection occurs across the vertical line just to the right of the azure object's bounding box (axis x = 5.5).
    *   In Examples 2 and 3, the reflection occurs across the vertical line just to the left of the azure object's bounding box (axis x = 2.5).
7.  **Determining Reflection Direction:** The choice between reflecting left or right seems to depend on a specific feature of the azure object's shape. Comparing the examples, the crucial difference appears to be the presence or absence of an azure pixel at the bottom-center position *relative to the object's bounding box*.
    *   Let `min_col`, `max_col`, `max_row` be the bounding box limits of the azure object.
    *   Calculate the center column index within the bounding box: `center_col_in_bbox = min_col + floor((max_col - min_col) / 2)`.
    *   Check the pixel at `(max_row, center_col_in_bbox)`.
    *   In Example 1, this pixel `(2, 4)` is azure (8). The reflection is to the *right*.
    *   In Examples 2 and 3, this pixel `(2, 4)` is *not* azure (it's white 0). The reflection is to the *left*.
8.  **Rule Formulation:** The transformation identifies the azure object, determines its bounding box, checks the state of the pixel at `(max_row, center_col_in_bbox)`, selects the reflection axis accordingly (right edge if pixel is present, left edge if absent), calculates the reflected positions for all original azure pixels, and adds these reflected pixels (colored azure) to the output grid, merging with the original object. The yellow object is unaffected.
