**CRITICAL NEW INFORMATION:** The `find_objects` function found *multiple* azure objects in examples 2 and 3!

*   Example 2 Input: `[[0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0]...]`
    *   Object 1: (0, 3)
    *   Object 2: (0, 5), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5)
    My initial visual inspection was wrong. These are separate.

*   Example 3 Input: `[[0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0],[0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]...]`
    *   Object 1: (0, 3)
    *   Object 2: (1, 4), (1, 5)
    *   Object 3: (2, 3)
    Again, separate objects.

The original code only processed the *first* object found: `azure_object_coords = azure_objects[0]`. This explains the failure! The reflection logic needs to be applied to *all* azure objects, or there's a different rule altogether.

Let's re-examine the examples based on multiple objects:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input has one contiguous azure object.
    *   Bbox (0, 2, 3, 5). Center col 4. Pixel (2, 4) is 8 (azure).
    *   Reflect right. Expected output matches. Logic holds for single objects.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input has two azure objects: Obj1={(0, 3)}, Obj2={(0, 5), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5)}.
    *   Expected Output shows reflection of *both* objects to the *left*.
        *   Obj1 (0, 3) reflects to (0, 2). Axis `x = 2.5`. `2*3 - 3 - 1 = 2`. Correct.
        *   Obj2 (0, 5) reflects to (0, 0). Axis `x = 2.5`. `2*3 - 5 - 1 = 0`. Correct.
        *   Obj2 (1, 4) reflects to (1, 1). Axis `x = 2.5`. `2*3 - 4 - 1 = 1`. Correct.
        *   Obj2 (1, 5) reflects to (1, 0). Axis `x = 2.5`. `2*3 - 5 - 1 = 0`. Correct.
        *   Obj2 (2, 5) reflects to (2, 0). Axis `x = 2.5`. `2*3 - 5 - 1 = 0`. Correct.
    *   Why reflect left? The previous logic relied on the bounding box of a *single* object. What defines the reflection direction when there are multiple objects?
    *   Maybe we take the bounding box of *all* azure pixels combined?
        *   All azure coords: (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5).
        *   Combined Bbox: min_r=0, max_r=2, min_c=3, max_c=5.
        *   Center col: `3 + (5-3)//2 = 4`.
        *   Pixel to check: (max_r, center_c) = (2, 4). Input[2, 4] = 0 (white).
        *   Condition implies reflect *left*. Axis `x = min_c - 0.5 = 2.5`.
    *   This seems consistent! The rule might be: Find the bounding box enclosing *all* azure pixels. Determine the center column within this *overall* bounding box. Check the pixel at the bottom row of this overall bounding box at the center column. If azure, reflect *all* azure objects right relative to the *overall* max_col. If not azure, reflect *all* azure objects left relative to the *overall* min_col.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input has three azure objects: Obj1={(0, 3)}, Obj2={(1, 4), (1, 5)}, Obj3={(2, 3)}.
    *   Expected Output shows reflection of *all* objects to the *left*.
        *   Obj1 (0, 3) -> (0, 2). Axis `x = 2.5`. `2*3 - 3 - 1 = 2`. Correct.
        *   Obj2 (1, 4) -> (1, 1). Axis `x = 2.5`. `2*3 - 4 - 1 = 1`. Correct.
        *   Obj2 (1, 5) -> (1, 0). Axis `x = 2.5`. `2*3 - 5 - 1 = 0`. Correct.
        *   Obj3 (2, 3) -> (2, 2). Axis `x = 2.5`. `2*3 - 3 - 1 = 2`. Correct.
    *   Let's test the combined bounding box hypothesis:
        *   All azure coords: (0, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3).
        *   Combined Bbox: min_r=0, max_r=2, min_c=3, max_c=5.
        *   Center col: `3 + (5-3)//2 = 4`.
        *   Pixel to check: (max_r, center_c) = (2, 4). Input[2, 4] = 0 (white).
        *   Condition implies reflect *left*. Axis `x = min_c - 0.5 = 2.5`.
    *   This is also consistent!

**Revised Understanding:** The transformation applies to *all* azure pixels collectively. The reflection direction (left or right) and the axis of reflection are determined by the bounding box that encloses *all* azure pixels in the input grid.

**Final Check of Logic:**
1.  Find all azure (8) pixels in the input grid. If none, return the grid unchanged.
2.  Determine the overall bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) containing all azure pixels.
3.  Calculate the center column index within this overall bounding box: `center_c = min_c + (max_c - min_c) // 2`.
4.  Check the color of the pixel at the bottom-center position of the overall bounding box: `pixel_color = input_grid[max_r, center_c]`.
5.  If `pixel_color` is azure (8):
    *   Reflect *each* original azure pixel horizontally across the vertical line immediately to the right of the *overall* bounding box (axis `x = max_c + 0.5`). The reflected column is `reflected_c = 2 * max_c - c + 1`.
6.  If `pixel_color` is *not* azure (e.g., white 0):
    *   Reflect *each* original azure pixel horizontally across the vertical line immediately to the left of the *overall* bounding box (axis `x = min_c - 0.5`). The reflected column is `reflected_c = 2 * min_c - c - 1`.
7.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
8.  For each calculated reflected coordinate (reflected_r, reflected_c) that falls within the grid boundaries, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to azure (8). Note that original azure pixels remain.

This revised logic now correctly explains all three examples. The key was realizing the `find_objects` function separating pixels that looked contiguous and updating the logic to consider *all* azure pixels together for determining the reflection parameters.Okay, let's refine our understanding based on the execution results.

**General Assessment**

The initial code was based on the assumption of a single contiguous azure object, derived from observing only the first example. The execution results clearly show this assumption was incorrect, as examples 2 and 3 contain multiple, non-contiguous azure pixels/objects. The code failed because it only considered the first object found by the `find_objects` function.

The critical insight comes from the tool execution (`code_output`) which explicitly states that multiple azure "objects" (as defined by the BFS search for contiguous blocks) were found in examples 2 and 3. The expected outputs, however, show a single, coherent reflection operation being applied to *all* azure pixels present in the input.

The strategy is to revise the logic to consider all azure pixels collectively to determine the reflection parameters (direction and axis) and then apply this reflection to every azure pixel individually.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Reflect all azure pixels based on a condition determined by the overall bounding box of azure pixels.

observations:
  - The transformation focuses exclusively on the azure (8) pixels. Other pixels, like yellow (4), remain unchanged.
  - The output grid contains the original azure pixels plus new azure pixels representing a horizontal reflection.
  - The reflection logic depends on the overall bounding box encompassing *all* azure pixels in the input grid.
  - Let the overall bounding box be (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col).
  - The condition for reflection direction is determined by checking the pixel value at the coordinate (max_row, center_col_in_bbox), where center_col_in_bbox = min_col + floor((max_col - min_col) / 2).

reflection_rules:
  - rule: If the pixel at (max_row, center_col_in_bbox) is azure (8):
      action: Reflect all original azure pixels horizontally across the axis x = max_col + 0.5.
      reflection_formula: reflected_col = (2 * max_col) + 1 - original_col
      example_applies: 1
  - rule: If the pixel at (max_row, center_col_in_bbox) is NOT azure (e.g., white 0):
      action: Reflect all original azure pixels horizontally across the axis x = min_col - 0.5.
      reflection_formula: reflected_col = (2 * min_col) - 1 - original_col
      example_applies: 2, 3

output_grid_construction:
  - Create a copy of the input grid.
  - For each original azure pixel (r, c):
      - Calculate its reflected column `reflected_c` based on the applicable reflection rule.
      - The reflected row `reflected_r` is the same as the original row `r`.
      - If the reflected coordinate (reflected_r, reflected_c) is within the grid boundaries, set the color of that pixel in the output grid to azure (8).

1.  Identify all pixels with the azure color (8) in the input grid. If no azure pixels are found, return the input grid unchanged.
2.  Determine the overall bounding box that encloses all identified azure pixels. Let this box be defined by `min_row`, `max_row`, `min_col`, and `max_col`.
3.  Calculate the horizontal center column index *within* this bounding box using the formula: `center_col = min_col + floor((max_col - min_col) / 2)`.
4.  Inspect the color of the pixel located at the bottom row (`max_row`) and the calculated center column (`center_col`) of the bounding box within the input grid.
5.  If the color of this pixel is azure (8), then set the reflection mode to "right". The axis of reflection will be the vertical line immediately to the right of the bounding box (`x = max_col + 0.5`).
6.  If the color of this pixel is *not* azure (8), then set the reflection mode to "left". The axis of reflection will be the vertical line immediately to the left of the bounding box (`x = min_col - 0.5`).
7.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
8.  Iterate through each azure pixel found in step 1, located at `(row, col)` in the input grid.
9.  For each azure pixel, calculate its horizontally reflected column coordinate (`reflected_col`):
    *   If the reflection mode is "right", use the formula: `reflected_col = (2 * max_col) + 1 - col`.
    *   If the reflection mode is "left", use the formula: `reflected_col = (2 * min_col) - 1 - col`.
10. The reflected row coordinate (`reflected_row`) is the same as the original `row`.
11. Check if the calculated reflected coordinate (`reflected_row`, `reflected_col`) lies within the boundaries of the grid.
12. If the reflected coordinate is within the grid boundaries, set the color of the pixel at (`reflected_row`, `reflected_col`) in the output grid to azure (8).
13. After processing all original azure pixels, return the modified output grid.
