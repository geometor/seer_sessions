elements:
  - role: background
    color: green (3)
    properties: Typically forms the border or fills most of the grid area. Unchanging.
  - role: primary_object_1
    color: white (0)
    properties: Exactly one contiguous block per input. Location changes to blue (1) in the output.
  - role: primary_object_2
    color: red (2)
    properties: Exactly one contiguous block per input. Its transformation depends on other objects. Let its dimensions be D_red.
  - role: secondary_objects
    color: blue (1)
    properties: Can be multiple contiguous blocks of various shapes and sizes. One specific blue object might be targeted for transformation.

relationships:
  - type: spatial_comparison
    description: The dimensions (height and width) of the red object (primary_object_2) are compared against the dimensions of all blue objects (secondary_objects).

actions:
  - name: identify_objects
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [white_object_coords, red_object_coords, blue_object_list]
    description: Find coordinates and dimensions of the single white object, the single red object, and all distinct blue objects.
  - name: transform_white_object
    inputs: [output_grid, white_object_coords]
    outputs: [modified_output_grid]
    description: Change the color of the pixels at white_object_coords to blue (1).
  - name: conditional_transformation
    inputs: [output_grid, red_object_coords, red_object_dims, blue_object_list]
    outputs: [modified_output_grid]
    description: >
      Search blue_object_list for a blue object whose dimensions match red_object_dims.
      If a match is found (target_blue_object):
        Change the color of pixels at target_blue_object's coordinates to white (0).
      Else (no match found):
        Change the color of pixels at red_object_coords to white (0).
