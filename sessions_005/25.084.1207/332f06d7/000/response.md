Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task involves transforming an input grid of colored pixels into an output grid. The grids vary in size.
2.  **Colors Used:** The primary colors involved are Green (3 - often background), Blue (1), Red (2), and White (0).
3.  **Key Objects:** In each input grid, there appears to be exactly one distinct, contiguous object composed of Red (2) pixels and exactly one distinct, contiguous object composed of White (0) pixels. There are also various objects composed of Blue (1) pixels.
4.  **Transformations:** The core transformation involves the Red and White objects, but the specific change depends on the context within the grid:
    *   The pixels originally occupied by the White (0) object *always* become Blue (1) in the output grid.
    *   The fate of the Red (2) object depends on the presence of Blue (1) objects:
        *   **Scenario A (Train 1, Train 4):** If there isn't a Blue (1) object in the input that has the exact same dimensions (height and width) as the Red (2) object, the pixels originally occupied by the Red (2) object become White (0) in the output grid.
        *   **Scenario B (Train 2, Train 3):** If there *is* a Blue (1) object with the exact same dimensions as the Red (2) object, that specific Blue object's pixels become White (0) in the output grid, and the original Red (2) object remains unchanged (stays Red).
5.  **Other Pixels:** All other pixels (like the Green background and any Blue pixels not involved in Scenario B) retain their original color in the output grid.

**Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - role: background
    color: green (3)
    properties: Typically forms the border or fills most of the grid area. Unchanging.
  - role: primary_object_1
    color: white (0)
    properties: Exactly one contiguous block per input. Location changes to blue (1) in the output.
  - role: primary_object_2
    color: red (2)
    properties: Exactly one contiguous block per input. Its transformation depends on other objects. Let its dimensions be D_red.
  - role: secondary_objects
    color: blue (1)
    properties: Can be multiple contiguous blocks of various shapes and sizes. One specific blue object might be targeted for transformation.

relationships:
  - type: spatial_comparison
    description: The dimensions (height and width) of the red object (primary_object_2) are compared against the dimensions of all blue objects (secondary_objects).

actions:
  - name: identify_objects
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [white_object_coords, red_object_coords, blue_object_list]
    description: Find coordinates and dimensions of the single white object, the single red object, and all distinct blue objects.
  - name: transform_white_object
    inputs: [output_grid, white_object_coords]
    outputs: [modified_output_grid]
    description: Change the color of the pixels at white_object_coords to blue (1).
  - name: conditional_transformation
    inputs: [output_grid, red_object_coords, red_object_dims, blue_object_list]
    outputs: [modified_output_grid]
    description: >
      Search blue_object_list for a blue object whose dimensions match red_object_dims.
      If a match is found (target_blue_object):
        Change the color of pixels at target_blue_object's coordinates to white (0).
      Else (no match found):
        Change the color of pixels at red_object_coords to white (0).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid, which will become the output grid.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of White (0) pixels in the input grid. Change all these pixels to Blue (1) in the output grid.
3.  Identify the contiguous block of Red (2) pixels in the input grid and determine its dimensions (height and width).
4.  Identify all distinct contiguous blocks of Blue (1) pixels in the input grid and determine their respective dimensions.
5.  Search for a Blue block whose dimensions exactly match the dimensions of the Red block identified in step 3.
6.  **If** such a matching Blue block is found:
    *   Change all pixels belonging to *that specific Blue block* to White (0) in the output grid. Leave the original Red block unchanged (it remains Red).
7.  **Else (if** no Blue block with matching dimensions is found):
    *   Change all pixels belonging to the original Red block (identified in step 3) to White (0) in the output grid.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
