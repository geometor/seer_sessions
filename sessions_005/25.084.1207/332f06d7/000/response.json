The grids vary in size.\n2.  **Colors Used:** The primary colors involved are Green (3 - often background), Blue (1), Red (2), and White (0).\n3.  **Key Objects:** In each input grid, there appears to be exactly one distinct, contiguous object composed of Red (2) pixels and exactly one distinct, contiguous object composed of White (0) pixels. There are also various objects composed of Blue (1) pixels.\n4.  **Transformations:** The core transformation involves the Red and White objects, but the specific change depends on the context within the grid:\n    *   The pixels originally occupied by the White (0) object *always* become Blue (1) in the output grid.\n    *   The fate of the Red (2) object depends on the presence of Blue (1) objects:\n        *   **Scenario A (Train 1, Train 4):** If there isn't a Blue (1) object in the input that has the exact same dimensions (height and width) as the Red (2) object, the pixels originally occupied by the Red (2) object become White (0) in the output grid.\n        *   **Scenario B (Train 2, Train 3):** If there *is* a Blue (1) object with the exact same dimensions as the Red (2) object, that specific Blue object's pixels become White (0) in the output grid, and the original Red (2) object remains unchanged (stays Red).\n5.  **Other Pixels:** All other pixels (like the Green background and any Blue pixels not involved in Scenario B) retain their original color in the output grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
