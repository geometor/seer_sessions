task_description: Swap colors based on dimensional matching between Red, White, and Blue objects.

definitions:
  - object_type: white_object
    color: 0 (White)
    attributes: [coords, dimensions]
    occurrence: exactly one per input grid
  - object_type: red_object
    color: 2 (Red)
    attributes: [coords, dimensions]
    occurrence: exactly one per input grid
  - object_type: blue_object
    color: 1 (Blue)
    attributes: [coords, dimensions]
    occurrence: zero or more per input grid

transformations:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify the single white_object (W).
    input: input_grid
  - step: 2
    action: Identify the single red_object (R).
    input: input_grid
  - step: 3
    action: Identify all blue_objects (B_list).
    input: input_grid
  - step: 4
    action: Create output_grid as a copy of input_grid.
  - step: 5
    action: Change the color of pixels corresponding to W's coords to Blue (1).
    target: output_grid
  - step: 6
    action: Check if any blue_object in B_list has dimensions identical to R's dimensions.
    condition: exists(B in B_list where B.dimensions == R.dimensions)
    branch_if_true: step 7
    branch_if_false: step 8
  - step: 7 # Condition True: A Blue object matches Red dimensions
    action: Change the color of pixels corresponding to R's coords to White (0).
    target: output_grid
    goto: end
  - step: 8 # Condition False: No Blue object matches Red dimensions
    action: Find a blue_object (B_match_W) in B_list whose dimensions match W's dimensions.
    condition: exists(B_match_W in B_list where B_match_W.dimensions == W.dimensions)
    branch_if_true: step 9
    branch_if_false: end # Assumption: If no match found, no further change needed (as seen in examples)
  - step: 9 # Found a Blue object matching White dimensions
    action: Change the color of pixels corresponding to B_match_W's coords to White (0).
    target: output_grid
  - step: end
    action: Return the modified output_grid.

# Notes:
# - Assumes exactly one White and one Red object exists in each input.
# - 'Dimensions' refers to the height and width of the object's bounding box.
# - If multiple Blue objects match the required dimension (either Red's or White's), the examples aren't sufficient to determine priority. The simplest implementation would take the first one found.
