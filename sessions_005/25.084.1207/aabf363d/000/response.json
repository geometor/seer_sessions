The input grid contains a background color (white/0), a larger contiguous object of one color (`source_color`), and a single pixel of another color (`target_color`). In the provided examples, this single pixel is located at the bottom-left corner. The output grid retains the shape and position of the larger object but changes its color from `source_color` to `target_color`. The single pixel that provided the `target_color` is removed (changed to the background color) in the output. The background pixels remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
