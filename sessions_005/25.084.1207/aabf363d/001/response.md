"""
Identifies two key objects in the input grid: a single-pixel object and the largest contiguous multi-pixel object.
The color of the single-pixel object (`target_color`) is determined.
The locations of the pixels forming the largest object (`source_locations`) are identified.
An output grid of the same dimensions as the input is created, initially filled with the background color (white/0).
The pixels in the output grid corresponding to `source_locations` are then set to `target_color`.
The single-pixel object is effectively removed because the output grid starts as background, and only the largest object's shape is drawn with the new color.
