*   **Perception**:
    *   The task takes a small input grid (3x3 in all examples) and produces a larger output grid (9x9 in all examples).
    *   The output grid appears to be a composite grid, structured as a grid of grids. Specifically, it looks like a 3x3 arrangement of smaller 3x3 blocks.
    *   Each block within the output grid is either a direct copy of the original input grid or a 3x3 block filled entirely with the 'white' color (0).
    *   The pattern of which block (input copy or white block) is placed at each position in the 3x3 super-grid seems determined by the colors present in the original input grid.
    *   Comparing the input grid's cell `(r, c)` color with the block placed at the super-grid position `(r, c)` suggests a mapping rule.
    *   By analyzing the examples, it appears that one specific color in the input grid acts as a "trigger". If the cell `(r, c)` in the input grid contains this trigger color, the corresponding block `(r, c)` in the output super-grid is a copy of the input grid. Otherwise, it's a white block.
    *   The trigger color seems to be the most frequently occurring color within the input grid.

*   **YAML Facts**:

      condition:

        then: place input_grid at output_supergrid[r][c]
        else: place white_block at output_supergrid[r][c]
      placement:
        block_top_left_coordinate: (r * H, c * W) # in output grid
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
    2.  Count the occurrences of each color within the input grid.
    3.  Identify the color that appears most frequently; this is the "trigger color".
    4.  Create a new output grid with dimensions (H \* H) rows and (W \* W) columns, initially filled with the 'white' color (0).
    5.  Create a "white block" grid with dimensions H rows and W columns, filled entirely with the 'white' color (0).
    6.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid using row index `r` (from 0 to H-1) and column index `c` (from 0 to W-1).
    7.  For the current cell `(r, c)`, check its color in the input grid.
    8.  If the color of `input_grid[r][c]` matches the "trigger color", select the original input grid as the "source block".
    9.  If the color of `input_grid[r][c]` does *not* match the "trigger color", select the "white block" as the "source block".
    10. Calculate the top-left starting coordinates in the output grid for the current block: `output_row_start = r * H`, `output_col_start = c * W`.
    11. Copy the selected "source block" (either the input grid or the white block) into the output grid, placing its top-left corner at `(output_row_start, output_col_start)`.
    12. After iterating through all cells of the input grid, the output grid construction is complete. Return the final output grid.
