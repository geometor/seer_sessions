Specifically, it looks like a 3x3 arrangement of smaller 3x3 blocks.\n    *   Each block within the output grid is either a direct copy of the original input grid or a 3x3 block filled entirely with the 'white' color (0).\n    *   The pattern of which block (input copy or white block) is placed at each position in the 3x3 super-grid seems determined by the colors present in the original input grid.\n    *   Comparing the input grid's cell `(r, c)` color with the block placed at the super-grid position `(r, c)` suggests a mapping rule.\n    *   By analyzing the examples, it appears that one specific color in the input grid acts as a \"trigger\". If the cell `(r, c)` in the input grid contains this trigger color, the corresponding block `(r, c)` in the output super-grid is a copy of the input grid. Otherwise, it's a white block.\n    *   The trigger color seems to be the most frequently occurring color within the input grid.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "

Iterate through each cell of the input grid using row index `r` (from 0 to H-1) and column index `c` (from 0 to W-1).\n    7.  For the current cell `(r, c)`, check its color in the input grid.\n    8.  If the color of `input_grid[r][c]` matches the \"trigger color\", select the original input grid as the \"source block\".\n    9.  If the color of `input_grid[r][c]` does *not* match the \"trigger color\", select the \"white block\" as the \"source block\".\n    10.
