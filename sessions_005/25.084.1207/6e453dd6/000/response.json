This line appears to be static and acts as a separator.\n    *   To the left of the gray line, the input grid contains patterns made of white pixels (color 0) on a magenta background (color 6).\n    *   To the right of the gray line, the input grid consists entirely of magenta pixels (color 6).\n    *   In the output grid, the gray line remains unchanged.\n    *   The white pattern to the left of the gray line is shifted horizontally to the left. The amount of shift seems determined by the initial empty space (magenta columns) on the far left of the pattern area. The area vacated by the shift on the right (just before the gray line) is filled with magenta.\n    *   To the right of the gray line in the output grid, some rows change from magenta (6) to red (2). This change seems conditional. Specifically, it occurs in rows where the pixel immediately to the *left* of the gray line in the *output* grid is white (0).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

If no white pixels exist in the left area, set `shift_amount` to 0.\n    6.  If `shift_amount` is greater than 0:\n        a.

Fill the remaining columns in the left area of the output grid (from `gray_col_idx - shift_amount` to `gray_col_idx - 1`) with magenta (color 6).\n    7.  Iterate through each row of the grid:\n        a.  Check the color of the pixel in the output grid at the column index `gray_col_idx - 1` (immediately to the left of the gray line).\n        b.  If this pixel is white (color 0), change all pixels in the current row within the right area (columns `gray_col_idx + 1` onwards) to red (color 2).\n        c.  (Implicitly, if the pixel is not white, the pixels in the right area remain as they were copied initially, which should be magenta).\n    8.  The final output grid is constructed."
