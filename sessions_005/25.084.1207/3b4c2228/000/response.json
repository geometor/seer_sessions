            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input:** The input grids vary in size and contain pixels of white (0), green (3), and red (2). The green and red pixels form distinct, contiguous objects (blocks of the same color).\n2.  **Output:** The output grid is always a 3x3 grid. It contains only white (0) and blue (1) pixels. The blue pixels, when present, always appear along the main diagonal, starting from the top-left corner (0,0).\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve counting the number of distinct green objects and red objects in the input. The relationship (comparison) between these counts determines the number of blue pixels (`N`) placed on the diagonal of the output grid.\n4.  **Key Elements:** The crucial elements are the green objects (color 3) and red objects (color 2). The transformation logic depends solely on the *count* of these objects, not their specific shapes, sizes, or positions.\n5.  **Output Structure:** The number of blue pixels (`N`) determines the output pattern: `N` blue pixels are placed at coordinates (0,0), (1,1), ..., (N-1, N-1) in the 3x3 output grid. The maximum value for `N` observed is 3.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
