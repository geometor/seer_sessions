Identify and count the number of distinct contiguous objects of green pixels (color 3) in the input grid (`num_green`).\n2. Identify and count the number of distinct contiguous objects of red pixels (color 2) in the input grid (`num_red`).\n3. Determine a value `N` based on the comparison of `num_green` and `num_red`:\n    - If `num_green` is less than or equal to `num_red`, `N` = 1.\n    - If `num_green` is greater than `num_red`:\n        - If the difference (`num_green` - `num_red`) is exactly 1, `N` = 2.\n        - If the difference (`num_green` - `num_red`) is 2 or more:\n            - If `num_red` is 1, `N` = 2.\n            - If `num_red` is 2 or more, `N` = 3.\n4. Create a 3x3 output grid initialized with white pixels (color 0).\n5. Place `N` blue pixels (color 1) along the main diagonal of the output grid, starting from the top-left corner (0,0) up to (N-1, N-1).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef _find_objects(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and counts distinct contiguous objects of a specified color in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        color (int): The color of the objects to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of distinct objects found.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    object_count = 0\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # If we find a pixel of the target color that hasn't been visited\n            if grid[r, c] == color and not visited[r, c]:\n                object_count += 1\n                # Start a search (BFS) to find all connected pixels of this object\n                queue = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                while queue:\n                    row, col = queue.popleft()\n                    # Check all 4 adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        # Check bounds and if the neighbor is the same color and not visited\n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                           grid[nr, nc] == color and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            queue.append((nr, nc))\n    return object_count\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on counting green and red objects.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.array): A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.array: A 3x3 numpy array representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Count green (3) and red (2) objects\n    num_green = _find_objects(input_grid, 3)\n    num_red = _find_objects(input_grid, 2)\n\n    # Determine the value of N based on the counts\n    n_blue_pixels = 0\n    if num_green <= num_red:\n        n_blue_pixels = 1\n    else: # num_green > num_red\n        diff = num_green - num_red\n        if diff == 1:\n            n_blue_pixels = 2\n        elif diff >= 2:\n            if num_red == 1:\n                n_blue_pixels = 2\n            elif num_red >= 2:\n                n_blue_pixels = 3\n            else: # num_red == 0 and diff >= 2 (though this case wasn't explicitly in examples, handle defensively)\n                  # Based on train_2 (3g, 1r -> N=2) and train_4 (4g, 2r -> N=3), increasing num_green seems key.\n                  # Let's assume if num_red is 0, diff >= 2 implies N=3? \n                  # Re-check logic:\n                  # T2: 3g, 1r. diff=2, num_red=1 -> N=2.
