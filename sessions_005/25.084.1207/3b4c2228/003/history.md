This module defines a function to transform an input grid based on counting green (3) and red (2) objects.

The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify and count the number of distinct contiguous objects of green pixels (color 3) in the input grid (`num_green`).
2. Identify and count the number of distinct contiguous objects of red pixels (color 2) in the input grid (`num_red`).
3. Determine a value `N` based on the comparison of `num_green` and `num_red`:
    - If `num_green` is less than or equal to `num_red`, `N` = 1.
    - If `num_green` is greater than `num_red`:
        - If the difference (`num_green` - `num_red`) is exactly 1, `N` = 2.
        - If the difference (`num_green` - `num_red`) is 2 or more:
            - If `num_red` is 1, `N` = 2.
            - If `num_red` is 2 or more, `N` = 3.
4. Create a 3x3 output grid initialized with white pixels (color 0).
5. Place `N` blue pixels (color 1) along the main diagonal of the output grid, starting from the top-left corner (0,0) up to (N-1, N-1).

**General Assessment**

The previous code successfully implemented the logic derived from the initial examples, correctly transforming examples 1, 2, 3, and 4. However, it failed on example 5. The expected output for example 5 has two blue pixels on the diagonal (`N=2`), while the code generated an output with only one blue pixel (`N=1`).

The failure indicates that the logic for determining the number of blue pixels (`N`) based on the counts of green (`num_green`) and red (`num_red`) objects needs refinement. The current logic produced `N=1` for example 5, which implies that the condition `num_green <= num_red` was met, or that the `else` block conditions for `N=2` or `N=3` were not satisfied correctly.

The strategy will be to:
1. Re-calculate the number of green and red objects for all examples, especially example 5.
2. Re-evaluate the relationship between `num_green`, `num_red`, and the expected `N` value for all examples.
3. Formulate a revised rule that correctly predicts `N` for all training cases.

**Gather Metrics**

Let's recalculate the number of green (3) and red (2) objects for each training example using the provided `_find_objects` function.

**Analysis of Metrics vs. Logic**

Let's tabulate the results and check against the previous logic:

| Example | `num_green` | `num_red` | `diff` (g-r) | Previous Logic Condition             | Predicted N | Expected N | Match |
| :------ | :---------- | :-------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------- | :---------- | :--------- | :---- |
| 1       | 1           | 3         | -2           | `green <= red`                       | 1           | 1          | Yes   |
| 2       | 5           | 1         | 4            | `green > red`, `diff >= 2`, `red == 1` | 2           | 2          | Yes   |
| 3       | 2           | 2         | 0            | `green <= red`                       | 1           | 1          | Yes   |
| 4       | 4           | 2         | 2            | `green > red`, `diff >= 2`, `red >= 2` | 3           | 3          | Yes   |
| 5       | 5           | 5         | 0            | `green <= red`                       | 1           | 2          | **No** |

The failure occurred in Example 5 because `num_green` (5) is equal to `num_red` (5). The previous logic dictates that if `num_green <= num_red`, then `N=1`. However, the expected output requires `N=2`.

This means the simple comparison `num_green <= num_red` is insufficient. We need a condition that results in `N=2` when `num_green == num_red == 5` (as in Example 5) but still results in `N=1` when `num_green == num_red == 2` (as in Example 3).

Let's reconsider the conditions, focusing on when N=2:
- Example 2: `num_green = 5`, `num_red = 1` -> `N=2`
- Example 5: `num_green = 5`, `num_red = 5` -> `N=2`

And N=1:
- Example 1: `num_green = 1`, `num_red = 3` -> `N=1`
- Example 3: `num_green = 2`, `num_red = 2` -> `N=1`

And N=3:
- Example 4: `num_green = 4`, `num_red = 2` -> `N=3`

It seems the absolute value of `num_green` might play a role when `num_green >= num_red`.

Revised Hypothesis:
1. If `num_green < num_red`, N=1. (Example 1)
2. If `num_green == num_red`:
   - If `num_green` (or `num_red`) is 5 or more, N=2. (Example 5)
   - Otherwise (if `num_green` < 5), N=1. (Example 3)
3. If `num_green > num_red`:
   - If `num_green = 5` and `num_red = 1`, N=2. (Example 2)
   - If `num_green = 4` and `num_red = 2`, N=3. (Example 4)

This looks complicated. Let's try simplifying the relationship. What if we consider `num_green + num_red` or some other combination?

| Example | `num_green` | `num_red` | `expected_N` | `g + r` | `g - r` |
| :------ | :---------- | :-------- | :----------- | :------ | :------ |
| 1       | 1           | 3         | 1            | 4       | -2      |
| 2       | 5           | 1         | 2            | 6       | 4       |
| 3       | 2           | 2         | 1            | 4       | 0       |
| 4       | 4           | 2         | 3            | 6       | 2       |
| 5       | 5           | 5         | 2            | 10      | 0       |

Observation: `N` seems related to `num_green`, but modulated by `num_red`.
- If `num_green` is much smaller than `num_red`, N=1 (Ex 1).
- If `num_green` equals `num_red`:
    - N=1 if they are small (Ex 3: 2,2)
    - N=2 if they are large (Ex 5: 5,5) -> Threshold seems to be around 5?
- If `num_green` is much larger than `num_red`:
    - N=3 if `num_green` is large enough relative to `num_red` (Ex 4: 4 > 2+1)
    - N=2 otherwise? (Ex 2: 5 > 1, but not by "enough"?)

Let's re-examine the original complex logic based on the *correct* counts:
*   Original Logic:
    *   N = 1 if green <= red
    *   if green > red:
        *   diff = green - red
        *   if diff == 1: N = 2  -> (Not seen in examples)
        *   elif diff >= 2:
            *   if red == 1: N = 2 -> (Example 2: g=5, r=1, diff=4 -> N=2. Correct)
            *   elif red >= 2: N = 3 -> (Example 4: g=4, r=2, diff=2 -> N=3. Correct)

This logic *correctly* handles examples 1, 2, 3, 4, *based on the counts*.
Example 1: 1 <= 3 -> N=1. Correct.
Example 2: 5 > 1, diff=4, red=1 -> N=2. Correct.
Example 3: 2 <= 2 -> N=1. Correct.
Example 4: 4 > 2, diff=2, red=2 -> N=3. Correct.
Example 5: 5 <= 5 -> N=1. **Incorrect**. Expected N=2.

The only case that fails is Example 5, where `green == red`. The original rule `N=1 if green <= red` needs modification for the `green == red` case.

Revised Logic Attempt 2:
1. Count green objects (`num_green`) and red objects (`num_red`).
2. Initialize N=0.
3. If `num_green == num_red`:
    - If `num_green >= 3` (or some threshold? Let's try 3 based on Ex 5 vs Ex 3), N=2.
    - Else (`num_green < 3`), N=1.
4. Else if `num_green < num_red`:
    - N=1.
5. Else (`num_green > num_red`):
    - diff = `num_green - num_red`
    - if `diff == 1`: N=2 (Hypothetical, not seen)
    - elif `diff >= 2`:
        - if `num_red == 1`: N=2
        - elif `num_red >= 2`: N=3

Let's test this Revised Logic 2:
- Ex 1 (1g, 3r): `num_green < num_red` -> N=1. Correct.
- Ex 2 (5g, 1r): `num_green > num_red`, diff=4, `num_red == 1` -> N=2. Correct.
- Ex 3 (2g, 2r): `num_green == num_red`, `num_green < 3` -> N=1. Correct.
- Ex 4 (4g, 2r): `num_green > num_red`, diff=2, `num_red >= 2` -> N=3. Correct.
- Ex 5 (5g, 5r): `num_green == num_red`, `num_green >= 3` -> N=2. Correct.

This revised logic seems to work for all training examples. The threshold for the `num_green == num_red` case appears to be `num_green >= 3` yields `N=2`, otherwise `N=1`.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: >
  Determine the number of blue pixels (N) to place on the main diagonal of a 3x3 white grid.
  N depends on the count of distinct contiguous green (3) objects and red (2) objects in the input grid.
  Object connectivity is based on side-by-side adjacency (4-connectivity).

transformation_rule:
  input: Input grid containing green (3) and red (2) objects amidst a white (0) background.
  output: 3x3 grid, initially white (0).
  logic:
    - Count distinct contiguous green objects (`num_green`) using 4-connectivity.
    - Count distinct contiguous red objects (`num_red`) using 4-connectivity.
    - Determine the number of blue pixels (`N`) based on the counts:
        - If `num_green < num_red`, then `N = 1`.
        - If `num_green == num_red`:
            - If `num_green >= 3`, then `N = 2`.
            - Else (`num_green < 3`), then `N = 1`.
        - If `num_green > num_red`:
            - Let `diff = num_green - num_red`.
            - If `diff == 1`, then `N = 2`.
            - If `diff >= 2`:
                - If `num_red == 1`, then `N = 2`.
                - Else (`num_red >= 2`), then `N = 3`.
    - Place `N` blue (1) pixels on the main diagonal of the output grid, starting from (0,0) up to (N-1, N-1). Fill the rest with white (0).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize a 3x3 output grid filled with white pixels (color 0).
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of green pixels (color 3) in the input grid, considering pixels connected horizontally or vertically as part of the same object. Let the total count of these green objects be `num_green`.
3.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of red pixels (color 2) in the input grid, using the same connectivity rule. Let the total count of these red objects be `num_red`.
4.  Determine a value `N` based on comparing `num_green` and `num_red`:
    *   If `num_green` is less than `num_red`, set `N` to 1.
    *   If `num_green` is equal to `num_red`:
        *   If `num_green` (or `num_red`) is 3 or greater, set `N` to 2.
        *   Otherwise (if `num_green` is less than 3), set `N` to 1.
    *   If `num_green` is greater than `num_red`:
        *   Calculate the difference: `diff = num_green - num_red`.
        *   If `diff` is exactly 1, set `N` to 2.
        *   If `diff` is 2 or more:
            *   If `num_red` is exactly 1, set `N` to 2.
            *   If `num_red` is 2 or more, set `N` to 3.
5.  Fill the main diagonal of the 3x3 output grid with blue pixels (color 1), starting from the top-left corner (0,0). Place exactly `N` blue pixels along this diagonal (i.e., at positions `(0,0)`, `(1,1)`, ..., `(N-1, N-1)`), ensuring not to exceed the grid boundaries.
6.  The resulting 3x3 grid is the final output.
