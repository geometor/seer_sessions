task_description: Fill the white space to the right of an initial pattern based on that pattern.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have identical height and width.
  - structure: Input grid consists of a left-side non-white pattern block and a right-side white (0) block.
row_based_transformation: True
pattern_block:
  - location: Left edge of the grid (columns 0 to W-1).
  - content: Contains non-white pixels (colors 1-9).
  - definition_W: Width 'W' is the index of the first column containing only white pixels (0).
white_block:
  - location: Right side of the grid (columns W to GridWidth-1).
  - content: Contains only white pixels (color 0).
transformation_rule:
  - scope: Applies only to the white block area in each row.
  - preservation: The initial pattern block (columns 0 to W-1) is copied unchanged to the output.
  - filling:
      - source: The colors from the initial pattern block `[C0, C1, ..., C(W-1)]` of the same row.
      - structure: The filled area consists of `N` repetitions of `C0` followed by the sequence `[C1, C2, ..., C(W-1)]`.
      - calculation_N: `N = (GridWidth - W) - (W - 1)`, where `GridWidth` is the total width of the grid. This ensures the filled area has the correct total length `GridWidth - W`.
