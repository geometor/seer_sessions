Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels. The grids have the same dimensions in each example pair.
2.  **Content Pattern:** The input grids consistently show a pattern of non-white colors starting from the left edge, followed by a block of only white pixels (color 0) extending to the right edge.
3.  **Transformation Locus:** The transformation preserves the initial non-white pattern on the left side of the grid. The changes occur exclusively in the area that was originally white in the input.
4.  **Row Independence:** The transformation seems to apply independently to each row. The filling pattern in a given output row depends only on the content of the corresponding input row.
5.  **Filling Logic:** The white area in each input row is replaced in the output row by a new pattern derived from the initial non-white pattern of that *same* row. Specifically:
    *   Let the initial non-white pattern in a row have width `W` and colors `[C0, C1, ..., C(W-1)]`.
    *   The filled area in the output starts with repetitions of the first color, `C0`.
    *   The filled area ends with the sequence of the remaining colors from the pattern: `[C1, C2, ..., C(W-1)]`.
    *   The number of repetitions of `C0` is precisely the amount needed to fill the space between the end of the original pattern (column `W-1`) and the start of the appended suffix `[C1, ..., C(W-1)]` in the output.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill the white space to the right of an initial pattern based on that pattern.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have identical height and width.
  - structure: Input grid consists of a left-side non-white pattern block and a right-side white (0) block.
row_based_transformation: True
pattern_block:
  - location: Left edge of the grid (columns 0 to W-1).
  - content: Contains non-white pixels (colors 1-9).
  - definition_W: Width 'W' is the index of the first column containing only white pixels (0).
white_block:
  - location: Right side of the grid (columns W to GridWidth-1).
  - content: Contains only white pixels (color 0).
transformation_rule:
  - scope: Applies only to the white block area in each row.
  - preservation: The initial pattern block (columns 0 to W-1) is copied unchanged to the output.
  - filling:
      - source: The colors from the initial pattern block `[C0, C1, ..., C(W-1)]` of the same row.
      - structure: The filled area consists of `N` repetitions of `C0` followed by the sequence `[C1, C2, ..., C(W-1)]`.
      - calculation_N: `N = (GridWidth - W) - (W - 1)`, where `GridWidth` is the total width of the grid. This ensures the filled area has the correct total length `GridWidth - W`.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  For the input grid, determine the width `W` of the initial non-white pattern block present at the left edge. `W` is the index of the first column (starting from 0) that consists entirely of white pixels (0). If no such column exists, `W` is the grid width.
2.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  For each row `r` of the input grid:
    a.  Copy the initial pattern (pixels from column 0 to `W-1`) from the input row `r` to the output row `r`.
    b.  If `W` is less than the grid width `GridWidth`:
        i.  Extract the colors of the initial pattern for this row: `Pattern = [input[r, 0], input[r, 1], ..., input[r, W-1]]`.
        ii. Let `C0 = Pattern[0]`.
        iii. Let the suffix pattern be `Suffix = [Pattern[1], Pattern[2], ..., Pattern[W-1]]`. (This suffix is empty if `W=1`).
        iv. Calculate the number of times `C0` needs to be repeated: `N_repeats = (GridWidth - W) - len(Suffix)`. Ensure `N_repeats` is not negative (it should be `max(0, N_repeats)` conceptually, though based on examples `N_repeats >= 0`).
        v. Construct the fill sequence by concatenating `N_repeats` copies of `C0` followed by the `Suffix`.
        vi. Place this fill sequence into the output row `r` starting at column `W`.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
