The grids have the same dimensions in each example pair.\n2.  **Content Pattern:** The input grids consistently show a pattern of non-white colors starting from the left edge, followed by a block of only white pixels (color 0) extending to the right edge.\n3.  **Transformation Locus:** The transformation preserves the initial non-white pattern on the left side of the grid. The changes occur exclusively in the area that was originally white in the input.\n4.  **Row Independence:** The transformation seems to apply independently to each row. The filling pattern in a given output row depends only on the content of the corresponding input row.\n5.  **Filling Logic:** The white area in each input row is replaced in the output row by a new pattern derived from the initial non-white pattern of that *same* row. Specifically:\n    *   Let the initial non-white pattern in a row have width `W` and colors `[C0, C1, ..., C(W-1)]`.\n    *   The filled area in the output starts with repetitions of the first color, `C0`.\n    *   The filled area ends with the sequence of the remaining colors from the pattern: `[C1, C2, ..., C(W-1)]`.\n    *   The number of repetitions of `C0` is precisely the amount needed to fill the space between the end of the original pattern (column `W-1`) and the start of the appended suffix `[C1, ..., C(W-1)]` in the output.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

For the input grid, determine the width `W` of the initial non-white pattern block present at the left edge. `W` is the index of the first column (starting from 0) that consists entirely of white pixels (0). If no such column exists, `W` is the grid width.\n2.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.\n3.  For each row `r` of the input grid:\n    a.  Copy the initial pattern (pixels from column 0 to `W-1`) from the input row `r` to the output row `r`.\n    b.  If `W` is less than the grid width `GridWidth`:\n        i.  Extract the colors of the initial pattern for this row: `Pattern = [input[r, 0], input[r, 1], ..., input[r, W-1]]`.\n        ii. Let `C0 = Pattern[0]`.\n        iii. Let the suffix pattern be `Suffix = [Pattern[1], Pattern[2], ..., Pattern[W-1]]`. (This suffix is empty if `W=1`).\n        iv. Calculate the number of times `C0` needs to be repeated: `N_repeats = (GridWidth - W) - len(Suffix)`. Ensure `N_repeats` is not negative (it should be `max(0, N_repeats)` conceptually, though based on examples `N_repeats >= 0`).\n        v. Construct the fill sequence by concatenating `N_repeats` copies of `C0` followed by the `Suffix`.\n        vi. Place this fill sequence into the output row `r` starting at column `W`.\n4.
