task_description: "Transform the right section of an input grid based on pixel values from both the left and right sections, separated by a blue vertical line."

grid_properties:
  - input_height: variable (e.g., 5 in examples)
  - input_width: variable (e.g., 7 in examples)
  - output_height: same as input_height
  - output_width: equals the width of the input grid's right section

elements:
  - element: "Separator Line"
    color: blue (1)
    location: Always a single vertical line at column index 3 in examples.
    function: Divides the input grid into a 'left_section' and a 'right_section'.
  - element: "Left Section Pixels"
    colors: [white (0), maroon (9)]
    location: Input grid columns to the left of the separator line.
    role: Influence the transformation of white pixels in the right section.
  - element: "Right Section Pixels"
    colors: [white (0), maroon (9)]
    location: Input grid columns to the right of the separator line.
    role: Determine the base structure and initial values for transformation into the output grid.
  - element: "Output Pixels"
    colors: [white (0), azure (8)]
    location: Output grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial_correspondence
    description: "Each output pixel at (row, col_out) corresponds to an input pixel in the right section at (row, col_right) and an input pixel in the left section at (row, col_left)."
    details:
      - "col_right = col_out + blue_line_column_index + 1"
      - "col_left = col_out (assuming left and right section widths are equal)"
  - type: transformation_dependency
    description: "The color of an output pixel depends on the colors of the corresponding left and right section input pixels."

transformation_rules:
  - rule: "Determine output grid dimensions based on the input grid's height and the width of its right section."
  - rule: "Map each output cell (r_out, c_out) to corresponding input cells (r_out, c_left) and (r_out, c_right)."
  - rule: "Apply color transformation based on input values v_left and v_right:"
    conditions:
      - if: "v_right == maroon (9)"
        then: "output = white (0)"
      - if: "v_right == white (0)"
        conditions:
          - if: "v_left == white (0)"
            then: "output = azure (8)"
          - if: "v_left == maroon (9)"
            then: "output = white (0)"

assumptions:
  - "A single vertical blue line always exists."
  - "The width of the left section equals the width of the right section." # Holds true for examples, needs verification for test case.
