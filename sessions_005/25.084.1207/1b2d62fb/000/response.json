            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure**: The input grids consistently feature a single vertical blue line (color 1) separating the grid into a left part and a right part. The colors present are white (0), blue (1), and maroon (9). The blue line always appears in the 4th column (index 3).\n2.  **Output Structure**: The output grids are always the same height as the input grids but have a width equal to the width of the right part of the input grid (which is 3 columns in all examples). The colors present are white (0) and azure (8).\n3.  **Transformation Core Idea**: The transformation seems to involve using the right part of the input grid as the basis for the output grid, but the specific color transformation for each pixel depends on both the pixel's value in the right part *and* the value of the corresponding pixel in the left part of the input grid.\n4.  **Pixel Mapping**: Let `B` be the column index of the blue line. For an output pixel at `(row, col_out)`, the relevant input pixels are:\n    *   The pixel in the right section: `(row, col_right)` where `col_right = col_out + B + 1`.\n    *   The pixel in the left section: `(row, col_left)` where `col_left = col_out`. This correspondence works because, in all examples, the width of the left section (`B`) equals the width of the right section (`W - B - 1`).\n5.  **Color Transformation Rules**:\n    *   If the pixel in the right section (`v_right`) is maroon (9), the output pixel is white (0), regardless of the left pixel's value.\n    *   If the pixel in the right section (`v_right`) is white (0), the output pixel's color depends on the corresponding pixel in the left section (`v_left`):\n        *   If `v_left` is white (0), the output pixel is azure (8).\n        *   If `v_left` is maroon (9), the output pixel is white (0).\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
