Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure**: The input grids consistently feature a single vertical blue line (color 1) separating the grid into a left part and a right part. The colors present are white (0), blue (1), and maroon (9). The blue line always appears in the 4th column (index 3).
2.  **Output Structure**: The output grids are always the same height as the input grids but have a width equal to the width of the right part of the input grid (which is 3 columns in all examples). The colors present are white (0) and azure (8).
3.  **Transformation Core Idea**: The transformation seems to involve using the right part of the input grid as the basis for the output grid, but the specific color transformation for each pixel depends on both the pixel's value in the right part *and* the value of the corresponding pixel in the left part of the input grid.
4.  **Pixel Mapping**: Let `B` be the column index of the blue line. For an output pixel at `(row, col_out)`, the relevant input pixels are:
    *   The pixel in the right section: `(row, col_right)` where `col_right = col_out + B + 1`.
    *   The pixel in the left section: `(row, col_left)` where `col_left = col_out`. This correspondence works because, in all examples, the width of the left section (`B`) equals the width of the right section (`W - B - 1`).
5.  **Color Transformation Rules**:
    *   If the pixel in the right section (`v_right`) is maroon (9), the output pixel is white (0), regardless of the left pixel's value.
    *   If the pixel in the right section (`v_right`) is white (0), the output pixel's color depends on the corresponding pixel in the left section (`v_left`):
        *   If `v_left` is white (0), the output pixel is azure (8).
        *   If `v_left` is maroon (9), the output pixel is white (0).

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: "Transform the right section of an input grid based on pixel values from both the left and right sections, separated by a blue vertical line."

grid_properties:
  - input_height: variable (e.g., 5 in examples)
  - input_width: variable (e.g., 7 in examples)
  - output_height: same as input_height
  - output_width: equals the width of the input grid's right section

elements:
  - element: "Separator Line"
    color: blue (1)
    location: Always a single vertical line at column index 3 in examples.
    function: Divides the input grid into a 'left_section' and a 'right_section'.
  - element: "Left Section Pixels"
    colors: [white (0), maroon (9)]
    location: Input grid columns to the left of the separator line.
    role: Influence the transformation of white pixels in the right section.
  - element: "Right Section Pixels"
    colors: [white (0), maroon (9)]
    location: Input grid columns to the right of the separator line.
    role: Determine the base structure and initial values for transformation into the output grid.
  - element: "Output Pixels"
    colors: [white (0), azure (8)]
    location: Output grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial_correspondence
    description: "Each output pixel at (row, col_out) corresponds to an input pixel in the right section at (row, col_right) and an input pixel in the left section at (row, col_left)."
    details:
      - "col_right = col_out + blue_line_column_index + 1"
      - "col_left = col_out (assuming left and right section widths are equal)"
  - type: transformation_dependency
    description: "The color of an output pixel depends on the colors of the corresponding left and right section input pixels."

transformation_rules:
  - rule: "Determine output grid dimensions based on the input grid's height and the width of its right section."
  - rule: "Map each output cell (r_out, c_out) to corresponding input cells (r_out, c_left) and (r_out, c_right)."
  - rule: "Apply color transformation based on input values v_left and v_right:"
    conditions:
      - if: "v_right == maroon (9)"
        then: "output = white (0)"
      - if: "v_right == white (0)"
        conditions:
          - if: "v_left == white (0)"
            then: "output = azure (8)"
          - if: "v_left == maroon (9)"
            then: "output = white (0)"

assumptions:
  - "A single vertical blue line always exists."
  - "The width of the left section equals the width of the right section." # Holds true for examples, needs verification for test case.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the column index (`B`) of the vertical blue line (color 1) in the input grid.
2.  Determine the dimensions of the output grid:
    *   Height: Same as the input grid height.
    *   Width: Equal to the number of columns to the right of the blue line (`input_width - B - 1`).
3.  Create a new grid (the output grid) with these dimensions, initially filled with a default color (e.g., white 0).
4.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c_out)` of the output grid (where `r` is the row index and `c_out` is the column index, starting from 0).
5.  For the current output cell `(r, c_out)`:
    a.  Find the corresponding column index in the input grid's right section: `c_right = c_out + B + 1`.
    b.  Find the corresponding column index in the input grid's left section: `c_left = c_out`.
    c.  Get the color value `v_right` from the input grid at `(r, c_right)`.
    d.  Get the color value `v_left` from the input grid at `(r, c_left)`.
    e.  Determine the output color `v_out` based on the following rules:
        *   If `v_right` is maroon (9), set `v_out` to white (0).
        *   If `v_right` is white (0):
            *   If `v_left` is white (0), set `v_out` to azure (8).
            *   If `v_left` is maroon (9), set `v_out` to white (0).
    f.  Place the calculated color `v_out` into the output grid at `(r, c_out)`.
6.  Return the completed output grid.
