The output grid retains the red pixels in their original positions but changes some of the white pixels to yellow (4). The input grids feature repeating patterns of red pixels forming diagonal structures. The transformation appears to involve identifying certain white pixels based on their proximity to the grid boundaries and their relationship to the red pixels, and then changing them and connected white pixels to yellow.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
