            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consist of a top portion with information and a bottom portion filled with white pixels (0). Specifically, the first row contains a sequence of different colors, and the second row is always a solid line of gray pixels (5).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids maintain the exact same first two rows as the input (the color sequence and the gray line). The area below the gray line, which was white in the input, is now filled with solid horizontal lines of color.\n3.  **Transformation:** The key transformation happens below the second row. The colors used to fill these rows are directly taken from the sequence in the first row of the input.\n4.  **Pattern:** The sequence of colors from the first row is repeated vertically to fill the rows below the gray line. If the first row sequence is `c1, c2, c3`, the third row in the output will be all `c1`, the fourth row all `c2`, the fifth row all `c3`, the sixth row all `c1` again, and so on, cycling through the sequence until all rows are filled.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
