task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - input_output_same_dimensions: True
    - input_row_0: Contains a sequence of colors (variable length).
    - input_row_1: Consists entirely of gray pixels (color 5), acting as a separator.
    - input_rows_below_1: Consist entirely of white pixels (color 0).
    - output_row_0: Identical to input_row_0.
    - output_row_1: Identical to input_row_1.
    - output_rows_below_1: Filled with solid horizontal color lines.
objects:
  - id: color_sequence
    description: The sequence of colors present in the first row (row 0) of the input grid.
    location: Input grid, row 0.
  - id: separator_line
    description: The solid gray line (color 5) in the second row (row 1).
    location: Input and Output grids, row 1.
  - id: fill_area_input
    description: The area below the separator_line in the input grid, filled with white pixels (0).
    location: Input grid, rows 2 to H-1 (where H is grid height).
  - id: fill_area_output
    description: The area below the separator_line in the output grid, filled with repeating colored rows.
    location: Output grid, rows 2 to H-1.
relationships:
  - type: Derivation
    from: color_sequence
    to: fill_area_output
    details: The colors used to fill the rows in fill_area_output are determined by cyclically repeating the colors from color_sequence.
actions:
  - action: Copy
    source: Input grid, rows 0 and 1.
    target: Output grid, rows 0 and 1.
  - action: Identify
    target: color_sequence from input row 0.
  - action: Fill
    target: Output grid rows from index 2 to H-1.
    details: For each row `i` (starting from index 2), fill the row with the color found at index `(i - 2) % length(color_sequence)` in the color_sequence.
