The input grids contain one or more 'U'-shaped objects composed of a single color (green, magenta, azure). The output grids are identical to the input grids, but with additional yellow pixels placed in the last row. The position of each new yellow pixel seems related to the horizontal position of a 'U' shape above it.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
