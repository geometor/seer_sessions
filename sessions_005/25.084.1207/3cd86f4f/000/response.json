            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements**\n\nThe task involves transforming an input grid into a larger output grid. The core transformation appears to be a diagonal shift or skewing of the original input grid content within an expanded canvas.\n\n1.  **Grid Expansion:** The output grid always has the same height as the input grid but is wider. The amount of width increase seems related to the height of the input grid.\n2.  **Padding:** The extra space created by the expansion is filled with white pixels (color code 0).\n3.  **Content Shifting:** The content of each row from the input grid is shifted horizontally to the right in the output grid.\n4.  **Shift Pattern:** The amount of horizontal shift is not uniform for all rows. The topmost row is shifted the most, and the shift amount decreases progressively for each subsequent row, with the bottommost row having the least (or zero) shift. The maximum shift amount appears to be related to the height of the input grid. Specifically, it looks like the shift for row `r` (0-indexed) is `(input_height - 1) - r`.\n5.  **Output Width Calculation:** The new width of the output grid is the original input width plus the maximum shift amount (`input_height - 1`).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Calculate the width of the output grid: `W_out = W_in + (H - 1)`.\n4.  Create a new output grid with dimensions `H` x `W_out`, initializing all its pixels to white (0).\n5.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from row index `r = 0` to `H - 1`.\n6.  For each row `r`, calculate the horizontal shift amount: `shift = (H - 1) - r`.\n7.  Copy the pixels from the input grid's row `r` into the output grid's row `r`, starting at column index `shift`. The copied pixels will occupy columns from `shift` to `shift + W_in - 1` in the output row.\n8.  Return the completed output grid."
