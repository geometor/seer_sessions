"""
Processes a 2D grid representing colored pixels. For each row independently:
1. Identifies if a specific pair of colors exists: Yellow(4)/Orange(7) or Blue(1)/Azure(8).
2. If a pair exists, it determines the leftmost ('target') and rightmost ('mover') pixel of the pair.
3. It checks if the path between the 'target' and 'mover' (exclusive of endpoints) consists entirely of White(0) pixels.
4. If the path is clear, the 'mover' pixel is moved horizontally leftwards until it is adjacent to the right of the 'target' pixel. The original position of the 'mover' pixel is set to White(0).
5. Pixels not involved in these specific pair interactions remain unchanged.
