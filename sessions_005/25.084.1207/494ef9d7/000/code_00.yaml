task_description: "Move specific colored pixels horizontally leftwards within their row to become adjacent to their paired color, clearing their original position."
elements:
  - element: "Grid"
    properties:
      - type: "2D array"
      - cells: "Pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors"
  - element: "Color Pairs"
    properties:
      - pair_1: [Yellow(4), Orange(7)]
      - pair_2: [Blue(1), Azure(8)]
      - relationship: "Partners in movement"
  - element: "White Pixel (0)"
    properties:
      - role: "Background"
      - role: "Path for movement"
      - role: "Replaces original position of moved pixel"
  - element: "Other Colors"
    properties:
      - role: "Static obstacles/context (generally)"
actions:
  - action: "Identify Pairs"
    details: "For each row, check for the presence of both colors from pair_1 or pair_2."
  - action: "Determine Movement"
    details: "If a pair exists in a row, identify the leftmost ('target') and rightmost ('mover') pixels of the pair."
  - action: "Check Path"
    details: "Verify if all pixels between the 'mover' and 'target' (exclusive) are White(0)."
  - action: "Execute Move"
    conditions:
      - "Path is clear (all intermediate cells are White(0))."
    steps:
      - "Change the pixel at the 'mover's original position to White(0)."
      - "Change the pixel immediately to the right of the 'target' position to the 'mover's color."
scope: "Process each row independently."
constraints:
  - "Movement is strictly horizontal (leftwards)."
  - "Movement stops when the 'mover' is adjacent (right side) to the 'target'."
  - "Only the specified pairs (4/7, 1/8) interact and move."
