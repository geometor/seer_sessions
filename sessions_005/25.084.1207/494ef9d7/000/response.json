            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both 2D grids of colored pixels. The size of the grid varies between examples.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved seem to be Blue(1), Red(2), Green(3), Yellow(4), Gray(5), Magenta(6), Orange(7), Azure(8), Maroon(9), and White(0) (background). However, the core transformation focuses on specific pairs: Yellow(4)/Orange(7) and Blue(1)/Azure(8). Other colors appear but remain static.\n3.  **Changes:** Comparing input and output grids reveals that certain colored pixels move horizontally within their rows. Specifically, one pixel from a pair moves leftwards until it becomes adjacent to the other pixel in that pair. The original position of the moved pixel becomes White(0).\n4.  **Movement Condition:** The movement only occurs if the pixels between the original position of the moving pixel and the target pixel are all White(0).\n5.  **Pair Interaction:**\n    *   If Yellow(4) and Orange(7) are in the same row, the one further to the right moves left until it's next to the one on the left.\n    *   If Blue(1) and Azure(8) are in the same row, the one further to the right moves left until it's next to the one on the left.\n6.  **Independence:** The transformations appear to happen independently for each row. The presence or movement of pairs in one row doesn't affect other rows.\n7.  **Static Elements:** Pixels that are not part of these specific pairs (Yellow/Orange, Blue/Azure) or are White(0) generally remain unchanged unless they are part of the path cleared by a moving pixel.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
