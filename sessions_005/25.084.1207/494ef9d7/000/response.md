Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both 2D grids of colored pixels. The size of the grid varies between examples.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved seem to be Blue(1), Red(2), Green(3), Yellow(4), Gray(5), Magenta(6), Orange(7), Azure(8), Maroon(9), and White(0) (background). However, the core transformation focuses on specific pairs: Yellow(4)/Orange(7) and Blue(1)/Azure(8). Other colors appear but remain static.
3.  **Changes:** Comparing input and output grids reveals that certain colored pixels move horizontally within their rows. Specifically, one pixel from a pair moves leftwards until it becomes adjacent to the other pixel in that pair. The original position of the moved pixel becomes White(0).
4.  **Movement Condition:** The movement only occurs if the pixels between the original position of the moving pixel and the target pixel are all White(0).
5.  **Pair Interaction:**
    *   If Yellow(4) and Orange(7) are in the same row, the one further to the right moves left until it's next to the one on the left.
    *   If Blue(1) and Azure(8) are in the same row, the one further to the right moves left until it's next to the one on the left.
6.  **Independence:** The transformations appear to happen independently for each row. The presence or movement of pairs in one row doesn't affect other rows.
7.  **Static Elements:** Pixels that are not part of these specific pairs (Yellow/Orange, Blue/Azure) or are White(0) generally remain unchanged unless they are part of the path cleared by a moving pixel.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: "Move specific colored pixels horizontally leftwards within their row to become adjacent to their paired color, clearing their original position."
elements:
  - element: "Grid"
    properties:
      - type: "2D array"
      - cells: "Pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors"
  - element: "Color Pairs"
    properties:
      - pair_1: [Yellow(4), Orange(7)]
      - pair_2: [Blue(1), Azure(8)]
      - relationship: "Partners in movement"
  - element: "White Pixel (0)"
    properties:
      - role: "Background"
      - role: "Path for movement"
      - role: "Replaces original position of moved pixel"
  - element: "Other Colors"
    properties:
      - role: "Static obstacles/context (generally)"
actions:
  - action: "Identify Pairs"
    details: "For each row, check for the presence of both colors from pair_1 or pair_2."
  - action: "Determine Movement"
    details: "If a pair exists in a row, identify the leftmost ('target') and rightmost ('mover') pixels of the pair."
  - action: "Check Path"
    details: "Verify if all pixels between the 'mover' and 'target' (exclusive) are White(0)."
  - action: "Execute Move"
    conditions:
      - "Path is clear (all intermediate cells are White(0))."
    steps:
      - "Change the pixel at the 'mover's original position to White(0)."
      - "Change the pixel immediately to the right of the 'target' position to the 'mover's color."
scope: "Process each row independently."
constraints:
  - "Movement is strictly horizontal (leftwards)."
  - "Movement stops when the 'mover' is adjacent (right side) to the 'target'."
  - "Only the specified pairs (4/7, 1/8) interact and move."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  For each row in the input grid:
    a.  Find the column indices of Yellow(4), Orange(7), Blue(1), and Azure(8) pixels, if they exist in that row. Assume at most one instance of each relevant color per row based on examples.
    b.  **Check Yellow(4)/Orange(7) pair:**
        i.  If both Yellow(4) and Orange(7) are present in the row:
            1.  Determine which one is the mover (rightmost column index) and which is the target (leftmost column index).
            2.  Check if all cells between the target's column + 1 and the mover's column - 1 (inclusive) contain only White(0).
            3.  If the path is clear, update the output grid: Set the cell at the mover's original position (row, mover\_col) to White(0), and set the cell at the position adjacent to the target (row, target\_col + 1) to the mover's color.
    c.  **Check Blue(1)/Azure(8) pair:**
        i.  If both Blue(1) and Azure(8) are present in the row:
            1.  Determine which one is the mover (rightmost column index) and which is the target (leftmost column index).
            2.  Check if all cells between the target's column + 1 and the mover's column - 1 (inclusive) contain only White(0).
            3.  If the path is clear, update the output grid: Set the cell at the mover's original position (row, mover\_col) to White(0), and set the cell at the position adjacent to the target (row, target\_col + 1) to the mover's color.
3.  Return the final output grid.
