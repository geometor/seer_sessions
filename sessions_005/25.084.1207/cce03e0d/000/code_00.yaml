task_description: "Replicate the input grid into specific locations within a larger output grid based on the positions of a trigger color (Red) in the input."
grid_properties:
  input_size: [3, 3] # Observed in examples
  output_size_relation: "3 times the input dimensions" # Output is 9x9 for 3x3 input
  output_size: [9, 9] # Observed in examples
  background_color: 0 # White

  - id: input_grid
    description: "The entire 3x3 input pattern."
  - id: trigger_pixel
    description: "A pixel with the color Red (2) in the input grid."
    properties:
      color: 2
      role: "Determines placement locations in the output."

    description: "The 9x9 target grid."
    properties:
      initial_state: "Filled entirely with White (0)."
relationships:
  - type: scaling
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    details: "Output grid dimensions are 3x height and 3x width of the input grid."
  - type: mapping_placement
    from: trigger_pixel
    to: output_grid
    details: "Each trigger_pixel at input coordinates (r, c) dictates that a copy of the input_grid should be placed in the output_grid starting at coordinates (r * 3, c * 3)."
