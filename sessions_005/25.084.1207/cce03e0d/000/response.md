Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Scaling:** The output grid is consistently 3 times larger than the input grid in both height and width (3x3 input becomes 9x9 output).
2.  **Subgrid Structure:** The output grid can be conceptually divided into a 3x3 arrangement of smaller blocks, each the same size as the original input grid (3x3 blocks in this case).
3.  **Content Copying:** The original input grid's pattern is replicated within some of these 3x3 blocks in the output grid.
4.  **Conditional Placement:** The specific locations (which 3x3 blocks) where the input grid is copied into the output grid are not fixed but seem dependent on the content of the input grid itself.
5.  **Trigger Color:** Observing the examples, the presence and location of the Red (2) pixels in the input grid correspond directly to the placement locations of the input grid copies in the output grid.
6.  **Coordinate Mapping:** If a Red (2) pixel exists at coordinates (row `r`, column `c`) within the 3x3 input grid, a copy of the *entire* input grid is placed in the output grid starting at coordinates (row `r * 3`, column `c * 3`).
7.  **Background:** All areas in the output grid that do not receive a copy of the input grid are filled with the White (0) color.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the dimensions (height `H`, width `W`) of the input grid. (In the examples, H=3, W=3).
2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions (`H * 3`, `W * 3`). (In the examples, 9x9).
3.  Initialize all pixels of the output grid to White (0).
4.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at coordinates (`r`, `c`), where `r` ranges from 0 to `H-1` and `c` ranges from 0 to `W-1`.
5.  If the color of the input pixel at (`r`, `c`) is Red (2):
    a.  Calculate the top-left starting coordinate (`start_row`, `start_col`) for the copy in the output grid as (`r * H`, `c * W`). (In the examples, `start_row = r * 3`, `start_col = c * 3`).
    b.  Copy the entire input grid pattern into the output grid, starting at (`start_row`, `start_col`). This means for every pixel (`ir`, `ic`) in the input grid, its value is placed at the output grid coordinate (`start_row + ir`, `start_col + ic`).
6.  Return the completed output grid.
