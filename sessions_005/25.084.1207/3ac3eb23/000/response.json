            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels represented by integer color codes (0-9). The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output for each example (6x7 for train_1, 6x10 for train_2).\n2.  **Background:** The background is predominantly white (0).\n3.  **Input Objects:** The inputs contain one or more isolated non-white pixels. In `train_1`, there's a single yellow (4) pixel. In `train_2`, there's a red (2) pixel and an azure (8) pixel. These initial non-white pixels appear in the first row (row 0) in both examples.\n4.  **Output Transformation:** The output grids retain the original non-white pixels. Additionally, new pixels of the same color are added in the rows below the original pixels. These new pixels form a distinct vertical pattern extending downwards.\n5.  **Pattern Details:**\n    *   For an initial colored pixel at `(row, col)`, its color appears directly below it at `(row + 2, col)`, `(row + 4, col)`, etc., in the even-numbered rows relative to the initial row.\n    *   In the odd-numbered rows relative to the initial row (`row + 1`, `row + 3`, etc.), the color appears diagonally adjacent to the column of the pixel above it, specifically at `(row + 1, col - 1)` and `(row + 1, col + 1)`, then `(row + 3, col - 1)` and `(row + 3, col + 1)`, and so on.\n    *   This pattern continues down to the bottom of the grid.\n    *   If multiple colored pixels exist in the input (like in `train_2`), each one generates its pattern independently using its specific color.\n    *   The generation respects grid boundaries; pixels are not placed outside the grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
