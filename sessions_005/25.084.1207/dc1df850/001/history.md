Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task involves transforming an input grid of colored pixels into an output grid. The grids vary in size.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), azure (8), and magenta (6). White serves as the background.
3.  **Key Color:** Red pixels (2) appear to be the trigger for the transformation. Other colors (green, azure, magenta) seem unaffected and don't cause changes around them.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves adding blue pixels (1) around the red pixels.
5.  **Pattern:** The blue pixels form a 3x3 square centered on each red pixel, but with specific conditions:
    *   The central pixel (where the red pixel was) remains red.
    *   Only pixels that were originally white (0) in the input grid are changed to blue (1) within this 3x3 area.
    *   The transformation respects grid boundaries; blue pixels are only added within the grid's dimensions.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - varying_dimensions
  - element: pixel
    description: Individual cell within the grid.
    properties:
      - color: integer value 0-9
      - location: (row, column) coordinates
  - element: object
    description: In these examples, objects are single, isolated non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color
      - location
actions:
  - action: identify_pixels
    actor: rule
    target: input_grid
    condition: pixel color is red (2)
    description: Find the locations of all red pixels.
  - action: modify_neighborhood
    actor: rule
    target: output_grid (initially a copy of input_grid)
    trigger: each identified red pixel location (r, c)
    effect:
      - iterate through the 3x3 neighborhood centered at (r, c).
      - for each neighbor (nr, nc) (excluding the center (r, c)):
        - if (nr, nc) is within grid bounds AND the pixel at (nr, nc) in the input_grid is white (0):
          - set the pixel at (nr, nc) in the output_grid to blue (1).
    description: For each red pixel, change its white neighbors in the 3x3 surrounding area to blue in the output grid.
relationships:
  - relationship: neighborhood_modification
    subject: red_pixel (2)
    object: neighboring white_pixels (0)
    description: A red pixel causes its adjacent (including diagonal) white neighbors within a 3x3 area centered on itself to become blue (1).
    constraints:
      - modification only applies to white pixels.
      - modification respects grid boundaries.
      - the original red pixel remains unchanged.
      - other non-white pixels do not trigger this modification.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid that is an exact copy of the input grid. This will be the working grid for constructing the output.
2.  Iterate through each cell of the *input* grid to find the locations (row, column) of all pixels that are red (color 2).
3.  For each red pixel found at location (r, c):
    a.  Examine the 8 neighboring cells immediately surrounding (r, c) (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).
    b.  For each neighbor cell at location (nr, nc):
        i.  Check if the location (nr, nc) is within the bounds of the grid.
        ii. If it is within bounds, check if the pixel at (nr, nc) in the *input* grid has the color white (0).
        iii. If both conditions (within bounds and originally white) are true, change the color of the pixel at location (nr, nc) in the *working* grid to blue (1).
4.  After checking all neighbors for all red pixels, the working grid represents the final output grid. Return this grid.
