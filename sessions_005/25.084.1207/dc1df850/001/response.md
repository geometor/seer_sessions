"""
For each red pixel (color 2) found in the input grid, change its neighboring 
white pixels (color 0) within the 3x3 area centered on the red pixel to 
blue (color 1). The modification occurs on a copy of the input grid, 
respects grid boundaries, and only affects pixels that were originally white. 
The central red pixel itself remains unchanged. Other colors in the input 
grid are also preserved unless they are white neighbors of a red pixel.
