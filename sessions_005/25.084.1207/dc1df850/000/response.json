The grids vary in size.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), azure (8), and magenta (6). White serves as the background.\n3.  **Key Color:** Red pixels (2) appear to be the trigger for the transformation. Other colors (green, azure, magenta) seem unaffected and don't cause changes around them.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves adding blue pixels (1) around the red pixels.\n5.  **Pattern:** The blue pixels form a 3x3 square centered on each red pixel, but with specific conditions:\n    *   The central pixel (where the red pixel was) remains red.\n    *   Only pixels that were originally white (0) in the input grid are changed to blue (1) within this 3x3 area.\n    *   The transformation respects grid boundaries; blue pixels are only added within the grid's dimensions.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
