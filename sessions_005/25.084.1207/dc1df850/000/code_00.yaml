task_elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - varying_dimensions
  - element: pixel
    description: Individual cell within the grid.
    properties:
      - color: integer value 0-9
      - location: (row, column) coordinates
  - element: object
    description: In these examples, objects are single, isolated non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color
      - location
actions:
  - action: identify_pixels
    actor: rule
    target: input_grid
    condition: pixel color is red (2)
    description: Find the locations of all red pixels.
  - action: modify_neighborhood
    actor: rule
    target: output_grid (initially a copy of input_grid)
    trigger: each identified red pixel location (r, c)
    effect:
      - iterate through the 3x3 neighborhood centered at (r, c).
      - for each neighbor (nr, nc) (excluding the center (r, c)):
        - if (nr, nc) is within grid bounds AND the pixel at (nr, nc) in the input_grid is white (0):
          - set the pixel at (nr, nc) in the output_grid to blue (1).
    description: For each red pixel, change its white neighbors in the 3x3 surrounding area to blue in the output grid.
relationships:
  - relationship: neighborhood_modification
    subject: red_pixel (2)
    object: neighboring white_pixels (0)
    description: A red pixel causes its adjacent (including diagonal) white neighbors within a 3x3 area centered on itself to become blue (1).
    constraints:
      - modification only applies to white pixels.
      - modification respects grid boundaries.
      - the original red pixel remains unchanged.
      - other non-white pixels do not trigger this modification.
