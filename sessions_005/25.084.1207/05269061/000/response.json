            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the task examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** The input is a square grid (7x7 in the examples). It primarily consists of the background color white (0), with a few non-white colored pixels scattered within it. These non-white pixels sometimes form diagonal lines or patterns.\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid (7x7). It is completely filled with a repeating pattern of colors. The colors used in the output pattern are precisely the non-white colors found in the input grid.\n3.  **Color Extraction:** The core task seems to be identifying the unique non-white colors present in the input.\n4.  **Sequence Determination:** The non-white colors from the input form an ordered sequence that is used for tiling the output. The order seems to be based on the first appearance of each unique color when scanning the input grid row by row, from top to bottom, and left to right within each row.\n5.  **Sequence Transformation:** The sequence of colors derived from the input (let's call it the \"input sequence\") is then cyclically shifted to the left. The amount of the shift appears to be determined by the *minimum* color value found in the input sequence. Specifically, if N is the number of unique non-white colors and `MinColor` is the smallest value among them, the shift amount seems to be `(2 - MinColor) mod N`.\n6.  **Output Generation:** The final shifted sequence (the \"output pattern\") is used to tile the entire output grid. The color at a specific cell `(row, column)` in the output grid is determined by the element at index `(row + column) mod N` in the output pattern sequence, where N is the length of the sequence (number of unique non-white colors).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
