Okay, I will analyze the task examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid:** The input is a square grid (7x7 in the examples). It primarily consists of the background color white (0), with a few non-white colored pixels scattered within it. These non-white pixels sometimes form diagonal lines or patterns.
2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid (7x7). It is completely filled with a repeating pattern of colors. The colors used in the output pattern are precisely the non-white colors found in the input grid.
3.  **Color Extraction:** The core task seems to be identifying the unique non-white colors present in the input.
4.  **Sequence Determination:** The non-white colors from the input form an ordered sequence that is used for tiling the output. The order seems to be based on the first appearance of each unique color when scanning the input grid row by row, from top to bottom, and left to right within each row.
5.  **Sequence Transformation:** The sequence of colors derived from the input (let's call it the "input sequence") is then cyclically shifted to the left. The amount of the shift appears to be determined by the *minimum* color value found in the input sequence. Specifically, if N is the number of unique non-white colors and `MinColor` is the smallest value among them, the shift amount seems to be `(2 - MinColor) mod N`.
6.  **Output Generation:** The final shifted sequence (the "output pattern") is used to tile the entire output grid. The color at a specific cell `(row, column)` in the output grid is determined by the element at index `(row + column) mod N` in the output pattern sequence, where N is the length of the sequence (number of unique non-white colors).

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Fill a grid with a repeating color pattern based on input colors.

Input:
  - type: grid
  - properties:
      - contains mostly white pixels (0)
      - contains a small number of non-white pixels (1-9)
      - dimensions: H x W (e.g., 7x7)

Output:
  - type: grid
  - properties:
      - same dimensions as input grid (H x W)
      - completely filled (no white pixels unless white was a non-background color in input, which isn't the case here)
      - contains a repeating pattern using only the non-white colors from the input

Derived Elements:
  - Non_White_Colors: The set of unique pixel values in the input grid, excluding white (0).
  - Input_Sequence: An ordered list of Non_White_Colors, based on the order of their first appearance scanning the input grid row-by-row, left-to-right.
  - Sequence_Length (N): The number of unique Non_White_Colors (length of Input_Sequence).
  - Minimum_Color (MinColor): The minimum value in Non_White_Colors.
  - Shift_Amount: Calculated as `(2 - Minimum_Color) mod Sequence_Length`.
  - Output_Pattern: The Input_Sequence after being cyclically shifted left by Shift_Amount positions.

Transformation:
  - Identify Non_White_Colors from the input grid.
  - Determine the Input_Sequence based on scan order.
  - Calculate Sequence_Length (N).
  - Find Minimum_Color.
  - Calculate Shift_Amount.
  - Generate Output_Pattern by shifting Input_Sequence.
  - Create the output grid.
  - For each cell (row, column) in the output grid:
      - Calculate the index: `idx = (row + column) mod Sequence_Length`.
      - Set the cell value to `Output_Pattern[idx]`.

Relationships:
  - Output colors are derived solely from input non-white colors.
  - Output grid structure is a tiled pattern based on the derived Output_Pattern.
  - The specific Output_Pattern depends on the Input_Sequence and the Minimum_Color via a cyclic shift.
  - The tiling method depends on the sum of the cell coordinates (row + column).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty list `input_sequence` and an empty set `seen_colors`.
2.  Iterate through the `input_grid` row by row (from top to bottom), and within each row, column by column (from left to right).
3.  For each pixel value `color` at coordinates `(r, c)`:
    *   If `color` is not white (0) and `color` has not been seen before (is not in `seen_colors`):
        *   Add `color` to `seen_colors`.
        *   Append `color` to the `input_sequence`.
4.  Determine the number of unique non-white colors, `N = length(input_sequence)`.
5.  Find the minimum color value in the `input_sequence`, `min_color`.
6.  Calculate the left cyclic shift amount: `shift = (2 - min_color) % N`.
7.  Create the `output_pattern` by cyclically shifting the `input_sequence` to the left by `shift` positions.
8.  Get the dimensions (height `H` and width `W`) of the `input_grid`.
9.  Create a new `output_grid` with dimensions `H x W`.
10. Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the `output_grid` (from `r = 0` to `H-1`, `c = 0` to `W-1`).
11. Calculate the pattern index: `index = (r + c) % N`.
12. Set the value of the `output_grid` at `(r, c)` to the color found at `output_pattern[index]`.
13. Return the `output_grid`.
