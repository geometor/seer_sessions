Task: Fill a grid with a repeating color pattern based on input colors.

Input:
  - type: grid
  - properties:
      - contains mostly white pixels (0)
      - contains a small number of non-white pixels (1-9)
      - dimensions: H x W (e.g., 7x7)

Output:
  - type: grid
  - properties:
      - same dimensions as input grid (H x W)
      - completely filled (no white pixels unless white was a non-background color in input, which isn't the case here)
      - contains a repeating pattern using only the non-white colors from the input

Derived Elements:
  - Non_White_Colors: The set of unique pixel values in the input grid, excluding white (0).
  - Input_Sequence: An ordered list of Non_White_Colors, based on the order of their first appearance scanning the input grid row-by-row, left-to-right.
  - Sequence_Length (N): The number of unique Non_White_Colors (length of Input_Sequence).
  - Minimum_Color (MinColor): The minimum value in Non_White_Colors.
  - Shift_Amount: Calculated as `(2 - Minimum_Color) mod Sequence_Length`.
  - Output_Pattern: The Input_Sequence after being cyclically shifted left by Shift_Amount positions.

Transformation:
  - Identify Non_White_Colors from the input grid.
  - Determine the Input_Sequence based on scan order.
  - Calculate Sequence_Length (N).
  - Find Minimum_Color.
  - Calculate Shift_Amount.
  - Generate Output_Pattern by shifting Input_Sequence.
  - Create the output grid.
  - For each cell (row, column) in the output grid:
      - Calculate the index: `idx = (row + column) mod Sequence_Length`.
      - Set the cell value to `Output_Pattern[idx]`.

Relationships:
  - Output colors are derived solely from input non-white colors.
  - Output grid structure is a tiled pattern based on the derived Output_Pattern.
  - The specific Output_Pattern depends on the Input_Sequence and the Minimum_Color via a cyclic shift.
  - The tiling method depends on the sum of the cell coordinates (row + column).
