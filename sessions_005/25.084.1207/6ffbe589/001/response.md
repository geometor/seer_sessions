"""
Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid.
Find all distinct groups (connected components) of these non-white pixels, considering pixels connected if they touch horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (8-way connectivity).
Calculate the size (pixel count) of each connected component.
Select the connected component with the largest size. If there's a tie, the specific examples don't show a clear tie-breaker, but typically the first encountered largest component would be chosen.
Determine the coordinates of the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that fully encloses this largest component. Record the minimum row index (min_row), maximum row index (max_row), minimum column index (min_col), and maximum column index (max_col).
Extract the subgrid from the input grid spanning from min_row to max_row (inclusive) and min_col to max_col (inclusive). This extracted subgrid is the final output.
