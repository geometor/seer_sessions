*   **Perception**: The task involves processing a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input grids are relatively large and sparse, containing distinct patterns or shapes composed of non-white pixels scattered on a white background. The output grid is always smaller than the input grid and seems to be a cropped section of the input. This cropped section consistently contains the most prominent or largest connected shape found in the input grid, preserving its colors and relative positions. Smaller, isolated non-white pixels or groups of pixels ("noise") present in the input are excluded from the output if they are not part of the largest connected structure. The transformation appears to be identifying the main "object" in the input and extracting its bounding box.

*   **Facts YAML**:
    
```yaml
    task_name: extract_largest_object
    grid_properties:
      - dimensions: variable (up to 30x30)
      - pixel_values: integers 0-9 representing colors
      - background_color: white (0)
    input_objects:
      - type: connected components of non-white pixels
      - connectivity: 8-way (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
      - properties:
          - color: pixels within a component can have different colors
          - size: number of pixels in the component
          - location: position within the grid
      - presence: typically one large component and potentially smaller "noise" components
    output_objects:
      - type: a single subgrid extracted from the input
      - content: corresponds exactly to the bounding box of the largest input object
      - size: determined by the dimensions of the largest object's bounding box
    transformation_steps:
      - step: find_non_white_pixels
        description: Identify all pixels in the input grid with a color value other than 0.
      - step: identify_connected_components
        description: Group the non-white pixels into connected components using 8-way adjacency.
      - step: calculate_component_sizes
        description: Determine the number of pixels in each identified component.
      - step: select_largest_component
        description: Choose the component with the maximum number of pixels. Assume uniqueness for now, or define a tie-breaking rule if necessary (e.g., topmost, leftmost).
      - step: determine_bounding_box
        description: Find the minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, and maximum column indices that enclose all pixels of the largest component.
      - step: extract_subgrid
        description: Copy the portion of the input grid defined by the calculated bounding box coordinates (inclusive) to form the output grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid.
    2.  Find all distinct groups (connected components) of these non-white pixels, considering pixels connected if they touch horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
    3.  Calculate the size (pixel count) of each connected component.
    4.  Select the connected component with the largest size.
    5.  Determine the coordinates of the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that fully encloses this largest component. Record the minimum row index (`min_row`), maximum row index (`max_row`), minimum column index (`min_col`), and maximum column index (`max_col`).
    6.  Extract the subgrid from the input grid spanning from `min_row` to `max_row` (inclusive) and `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive). This extracted subgrid is the final output.
