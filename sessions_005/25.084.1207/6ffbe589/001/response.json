If there's a tie, the specific examples don't show a clear tie-breaker, but typically the first encountered largest component would be chosen.\nDetermine the coordinates of the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that fully encloses this largest component. Record the minimum row index (min_row), maximum row index (max_row), minimum column index (min_col), and maximum column index (max_col).\nExtract the subgrid from the input grid spanning from min_row to max_row (inclusive) and min_col to max_col (inclusive).
