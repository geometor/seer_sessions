            "text": "*   **Perception**: The task involves processing a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input grids are relatively large and sparse, containing distinct patterns or shapes composed of non-white pixels scattered on a white background. The output grid is always smaller than the input grid and seems to be a cropped section of the input. This cropped section consistently contains the most prominent or largest connected shape found in the input grid, preserving its colors and relative positions. Smaller, isolated non-white pixels or groups of pixels (\"noise\") present in the input are excluded from the output if they are not part of the largest connected structure. The transformation appears to be identifying the main \"object\" in the input and extracting its bounding box.\n\n*   **Facts YAML**:\n    "
