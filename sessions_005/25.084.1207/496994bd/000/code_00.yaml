task_type: object_manipulation
grid_properties:
  - input_dimensions: variable (e.g., 10x5, 10x3)
  - output_dimensions: same as input
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: block
    description: A contiguous group of rows starting from the top row (row 0) containing non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - location: top of the input grid
      - colors: variable (e.g., red, azure, green)
      - height: variable (number of rows in the block)
      - width: same as grid width
actions:
  - identify: Locate the block of non-white rows at the top of the input grid. Determine its height (number of rows).
  - copy: Create a copy of this identified block.
  - transform: Vertically flip the copied block (reverse the order of its rows).
  - place: Position the flipped block at the bottom of the output grid, starting from the last row and going upwards, occupying the same number of rows as the original block's height.
relationships:
  - The output grid contains the original top block unchanged.
  - The output grid contains a vertically reflected version of the top block placed at the bottom.
  - The number of rows in the reflected block at the bottom equals the number of rows in the original block at the top.
  - The rows between the top block and the bottom reflected block in the output are white.
