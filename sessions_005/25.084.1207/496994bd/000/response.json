Below this block, the rest of the grid is filled with white pixels (0).\n2.  **Output Grids:** The output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids. They retain the original block of non-white rows at the top. Additionally, a vertically flipped (mirrored) copy of this top block is placed at the very bottom of the grid, replacing the white pixels that were originally there. The rows between the original top block and the new bottom block remain white.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the non-white rows at the top of the input, creating a vertically mirrored copy of these rows, and appending this mirrored copy to the bottom of the grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
