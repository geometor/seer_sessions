Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each example takes a larger grid as input and produces a smaller grid as output.
2.  **Frame Object:** The input grids consistently feature a rectangular frame made of Blue (1) pixels, exactly one pixel thick. This frame surrounds an inner area.
3.  **Corner Objects:** Outside the Blue frame, at the four corners of the input grid, there are distinct single pixels of various colors. These seem important.
4.  **Inner Content:** The area *inside* the Blue frame contains a pattern composed exclusively of Azure (8) and White (0) pixels. The dimensions of this inner area vary between examples, but match the dimensions of the corresponding output grid.
5.  **Transformation Pattern:** Comparing the inner Azure/White pattern to the output grid reveals a strong correlation:
    *   White (0) pixels in the inner pattern correspond directly to White (0) pixels in the output grid at the same relative positions.
    *   Azure (8) pixels in the inner pattern correspond to non-Azure, non-White pixels in the output grid. Specifically, the colors appearing in the output grid (other than White) match the colors found at the *corners* of the *input* grid.
6.  **Quadrant Mapping:** The specific corner color used to replace an Azure (8) pixel seems determined by the position of that Azure pixel within the inner grid. Azure pixels in the top-left portion of the inner grid are replaced by the input's top-left corner color, those in the top-right portion by the input's top-right corner color, and so on for the bottom-left and bottom-right portions. The inner grid appears divided into four quadrants.

      Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the inner_pattern_grid (dimensions H_inner x W_inner).

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify the Frame:** Locate the rectangular frame composed of Blue (1) pixels within the input grid. Determine its boundaries (top row, bottom row, left column, right column).
2.  **Extract Inner Pattern:** Extract the subgrid located immediately inside the Blue frame. This is the `inner_pattern`. Note its dimensions (height `H_inner`, width `W_inner`). The output grid will have these same dimensions.
3.  **Identify Corner Colors:** Get the colors of the four pixels at the absolute corners of the input grid: `TL_color` (top-left), `TR_color` (top-right), `BL_color` (bottom-left), and `BR_color` (bottom-right).
4.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an empty output grid with dimensions `H_inner` x `W_inner`.
5.  **Populate Output Grid:** Iterate through each pixel of the `inner_pattern` grid at row `r` (from 0 to `H_inner`-1) and column `c` (from 0 to `W_inner`-1):
    *   a. Define the quadrant midpoints: `mid_row = H_inner // 2` and `mid_col = W_inner // 2`.
    *   b. Get the color of the current pixel in the `inner_pattern`: `current_color = inner_pattern[r][c]`.
    *   c. **If `current_color` is White (0):** Set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to White (0): `output_grid[r][c] = 0`.
    *   d. **If `current_color` is Azure (8):** Determine the quadrant and set the output pixel color accordingly:
        *   If `r < mid_row` and `c < mid_col` (Top-Left Quadrant): `output_grid[r][c] = TL_color`.
        *   If `r < mid_row` and `c >= mid_col` (Top-Right Quadrant): `output_grid[r][c] = TR_color`.
        *   If `r >= mid_row` and `c < mid_col` (Bottom-Left Quadrant): `output_grid[r][c] = BL_color`.
        *   If `r >= mid_row` and `c >= mid_col` (Bottom-Right Quadrant): `output_grid[r][c] = BR_color`.
6.  **Return Output Grid:** The fully populated grid is the result.
