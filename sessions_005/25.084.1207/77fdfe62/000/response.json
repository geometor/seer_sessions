            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each example takes a larger grid as input and produces a smaller grid as output.\n2.  **Frame Object:** The input grids consistently feature a rectangular frame made of Blue (1) pixels, exactly one pixel thick. This frame surrounds an inner area.\n3.  **Corner Objects:** Outside the Blue frame, at the four corners of the input grid, there are distinct single pixels of various colors. These seem important.\n4.  **Inner Content:** The area *inside* the Blue frame contains a pattern composed exclusively of Azure (8) and White (0) pixels. The dimensions of this inner area vary between examples, but match the dimensions of the corresponding output grid.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:** Comparing the inner Azure/White pattern to the output grid reveals a strong correlation:\n    *   White (0) pixels in the inner pattern correspond directly to White (0) pixels in the output grid at the same relative positions.\n    *   Azure (8) pixels in the inner pattern correspond to non-Azure, non-White pixels in the output grid. Specifically, the colors appearing in the output grid (other than White) match the colors found at the *corners* of the *input* grid.\n6.  **Quadrant Mapping:** The specific corner color used to replace an Azure (8) pixel seems determined by the position of that Azure pixel within the inner grid. Azure pixels in the top-left portion of the inner grid are replaced by the input's top-left corner color, those in the top-right portion by the input's top-right corner color, and so on for the bottom-left and bottom-right portions. The inner grid appears divided into four quadrants.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

The output grid will have these same dimensions.\n3.  **Identify Corner Colors:** Get the colors of the four pixels at the absolute corners of the input grid: `TL_color` (top-left), `TR_color` (top-right), `BL_color` (bottom-left), and `BR_color` (bottom-right).\n4.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an empty output grid with dimensions `H_inner` x `W_inner`.\n5.  **Populate Output Grid:** Iterate through each pixel of the `inner_pattern` grid at row `r` (from 0 to `H_inner`-1) and column `c` (from 0 to `W_inner`-1):\n    *   a.
