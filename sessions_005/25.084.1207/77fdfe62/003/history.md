**Assessment and Strategy**

The provided execution results indicate that the `transform` function failed on all training examples, primarily due to incorrect output grid dimensions and subsequently incorrect pixel mapping. However, a manual trace of the code's logic against the examples suggests the code *should* produce the correct output.

1.  **Size Mismatch:** The reported `Transformed Output` grids have dimensions that don't align with the `Expected Output` or the dimensions of the `inner_pattern` extracted by the code (`np.zeros_like(inner_pattern)` should ensure the output has the same size as the inner pattern). For instance, in Example 1, the inner pattern is 2x2, the expected output is 2x2, but the reported transformed output is 4x4. This discrepancy is consistent across all examples.
2.  **Logical Error vs. Reporting Error:** This suggests either a fundamental misunderstanding incorporated into the code *or* an error in the reporting/testing environment that generated the results shown in the prompt. Given that the code explicitly initializes the output grid based on the inner pattern size and the manual trace aligns with the expected output, it is highly likely that the *reported results are incorrect*, and the code itself might be correct or very close to correct.

**Strategy:**

1.  Assume the manual trace is accurate and the code correctly implements the logic described in its docstring.
2.  Re-verify the key dimensions and properties using `tool_code`.
3.  Re-evaluate the transformation based on the assumption that the code *does* produce the expected outputs.
4.  Refine the Facts and Natural Language Program based on this confirmed understanding.

**Revised Analysis Based on Metrics:**

The metrics reveal a crucial detail missed in the initial code and manual trace: The `find_frame_boundaries` function used `np.argwhere(grid == 1)` which finds *all* blue pixels, including those potentially at the corners of the *input grid*. The examples show the corners are different colors, but blue pixels `1` might exist along the edges *connected* to the corner colors.

Let's re-examine Example 1 with this insight:
Input:

```
9 1 0 0 1 4  <- row 0
1 1 1 1 1 1  <- row 1
0 1 8 8 1 0  <- row 2
0 1 8 0 1 0  <- row 3
1 1 1 1 1 1  <- row 4
2 1 0 0 1 3  <- row 5
^ col 0   ^ col 5
```

Blue pixels are at: (0,1), (0,4), (1,0) to (1,5), (2,1), (2,4), (3,1), (3,4), (4,0) to (4,5), (5,1), (5,4).
The *minimum* row with blue is 0, *maximum* is 5. *Minimum* col is 0, *maximum* is 5.
So, `min_r=0, max_r=5, min_c=0, max_c=5`.
`inner_pattern = input_np[min_r + 1 : max_r, min_c + 1 : max_c]` becomes `input_np[1:5, 1:5]`.

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 8 8 1 0
1 8 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1
```

This inner pattern is 4x5 (Oops, the code output says 4x4, let me recheck that calculation... `max_c` is 5, so `max_c` slice index should be 5. `input_np[1:5, 1:5]` is correct. Ah, wait, the `find_frame_boundaries` function in the *original code provided* was correct: it finds the bounds of blue pixels). Let's stick to the original code's definition of frame.

Original `find_frame_boundaries` trace for Example 1:
Blue coords: (0,1), (0,4), (1,0) to (1,5), (2,1), (2,4), (3,1), (3,4), (4,0) to (4,5), (5,1), (5,4).
min_r = 0, max_r = 5, min_c = 0, max_c = 5.
Okay, the code *used* `find_frame_boundaries` which gives (0, 5, 0, 5).
Inner pattern extracted by code: `input_np[1:5, 1:5]`

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 8 8 1 0
1 8 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1
```

Size: 4x5.
Expected Output Size: 2x2.

This confirms the size mismatch. The code's definition of the "inner pattern" (everything inside the min/max bounds of *all* blue pixels) is incorrect.

**New Hypothesis:**

The frame isn't just defined by the min/max extent of *all* blue pixels. The relevant frame seems to be the *innermost rectangle* of blue pixels that encloses the central pattern containing Azure (8) and White (0) pixels. The pixels outside this frame (including the corners and potentially edge blue pixels) are used for reference colors but do not define the region to be transformed.

Let's refine `find_frame_boundaries` conceptually:
1. Find all blue pixels.
2. Identify the non-blue corners (TL, TR, BL, BR).
3. Find the extent of blue pixels *excluding* those on the absolute border rows/columns if those borders contain the non-blue corners.
   *   Alternatively, find the bounding box of the Azure(8)/White(0) region inside the grid, and then find the immediately surrounding blue frame.

Let's try the second approach: Bounding box of non-blue, non-frame pixels.
Example 1:
Non-blue pixels: (0,0)=9, (0,2)=0, (0,3)=0, (0,5)=4, (2,0)=0, (2,2)=8, (2,3)=8, (2,5)=0, (3,0)=0, (3,2)=8, (3,3)=0, (3,5)=0, (5,0)=2, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,5)=3.
Consider only the central cluster containing 8s and 0s: (2,2)=8, (2,3)=8, (3,2)=8, (3,3)=0.
Bounding box of this cluster: rows 2-3, cols 2-3.
The blue pixels immediately surrounding this are:
Row 1: (1,1) to (1,4)
Row 4: (4,1) to (4,4)
Col 1: (2,1), (3,1)
Col 4: (2,4), (3,4)
This forms a frame defined by `min_r=1, max_r=4, min_c=1, max_c=4`.
The inner pattern *inside this frame* is `input_np[1+1:4, 1+1:4]` -> `input_np[2:4, 2:4]`

```
8 8
8 0
```

This inner pattern is 2x2, which matches the `Expected Output` size.

Let's test this hypothesis on Example 2:
Central cluster with 8s/0s (relative to grid):
(2,2)=0, (2,3)=8, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0
(3,2)=8, (3,3)=8, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=8
(4,2)=0, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=8, (4,5)=0
(5,2)=8, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=8, (5,5)=8
Bounding box of this cluster: rows 2-5, cols 2-5.
Frame surrounding this:
Row 1: (1,1) to (1,6)
Row 6: (6,1) to (6,6)
Col 1: (2,1) to (5,1)
Col 6: (2,6) to (5,6)
Frame boundaries: `min_r=1, max_r=6, min_c=1, max_c=6`.
Inner pattern *inside this frame*: `input_np[1+1:6, 1+1:6]` -> `input_np[2:6, 2:6]`

```
0 8 0 0
8 8 0 8
0 0 8 0
8 0 8 8
```

This inner pattern is 4x4, matching the `Expected Output` size.

This revised definition of the frame and inner pattern seems correct.

definitions:
  - object: input_grid
    description: A 2D grid of pixels with colors 0-9. Contains corner pixels, a central pattern, and a surrounding frame.
    properties:
      - dimensions: H x W (height x width)
      - corner_pixels: Pixels at (0,0), (0,W-1), (H-1,0), (H-1,W-1). Their colors are used for mapping.
        - name: TL_color, TR_color, BL_color, BR_color

  - object: frame
    description: A rectangular structure of Blue (1) pixels immediately surrounding the central pattern. It defines the boundary for the transformation area.
    properties:
      - color: Blue (1)

      - location: Encloses the central_pattern. Does not include Blue pixels that might be part of the absolute grid border if corners are non-Blue.
    determination:
      1. Identify the bounding box of the central_pattern (pixels that are not the frame color, typically Azure(8) and White(0)).
      2. The frame consists of the Blue(1) pixels directly adjacent (including diagonals) to this bounding box from the outside.
      3. Determine the minimum and maximum rows (frame_min_r, frame_max_r) and columns (frame_min_c, frame_max_c) of these frame pixels.

  - object: central_pattern
    description: The region enclosed strictly within the 'frame'. This is the area subject to transformation.
    properties:
      - location: Pixels (r, c) where frame_min_r < r < frame_max_r and frame_min_c < c < frame_max_c.
      - dimensions: H_inner x W_inner
      - content: Primarily contains Azure (8) and White (0) pixels. Other colors might exist but seem irrelevant to the output.

  - object: output_grid

  - action: map_pixels
    actor: system
    input: central_pattern, output_grid, corner colors (TL, TR, BL, BR)
    output: populated output_grid
    logic:
      - Iterate through each pixel (r, c) in the central_pattern.
      - If central_pattern[r, c] is White (0), output_grid[r, c] remains White (0).
      - If central_pattern[r, c] is Azure (8):
        - Determine the quadrant of (r, c) within the central_pattern (relative to its center: H_inner//2, W_inner//2).
        - If Top-Left quadrant: output_grid[r, c] = TL_color
        - If Top-Right quadrant: output_grid[r, c] = TR_color
        - If Bottom-Left quadrant: output_grid[r, c] = BL_color
        - If Bottom-Right quadrant: output_grid[r, c] = BR_color
      - Other colors in central_pattern map to White (0) in the output.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Corner Colors:** Record the colors of the four pixels at the absolute corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) of the input grid. Let these be `TL_color`, `TR_color`, `BL_color`, `BR_color`.
2.  **Locate Central Pattern:** Find the contiguous block of pixels within the input grid that are primarily composed of Azure (8) and White (0) and are distinct from the outer border/corner colors and the surrounding Blue (1) frame. Determine the bounding box of this central pattern.
3.  **Identify Inner Frame:** Find the Blue (1) pixels that immediately surround the bounding box of the central pattern identified in step 2. Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices (`frame_min_r`, `frame_max_r`, `frame_min_c`, `frame_max_c`) of this specific Blue frame.
4.  **Extract Inner Pattern:** Extract the subgrid from the input grid located strictly *inside* the inner frame boundaries found in step 3. This is the region defined by rows `frame_min_r + 1` to `frame_max_r - 1` and columns `frame_min_c + 1` to `frame_max_c - 1`. Let the dimensions of this extracted inner pattern be `H_inner` x `W_inner`.
5.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the extracted inner pattern (`H_inner` x `W_inner`), initially filled with White (0).
6.  **Map Colors:** Iterate through each pixel at position (`r`, `c`) within the extracted inner pattern (where `r` ranges from 0 to `H_inner-1` and `c` ranges from 0 to `W_inner-1`).
    *   If the pixel color in the inner pattern is White (0), the corresponding pixel in the output grid remains White (0).
    *   If the pixel color in the inner pattern is Azure (8):
        *   Determine its quadrant within the inner pattern based on its position relative to the center (`mid_row = H_inner // 2`, `mid_col = W_inner // 2`).
        *   If `r < mid_row` and `c < mid_col` (Top-Left): Set the output grid pixel at (`r`, `c`) to `TL_color`.
        *   If `r < mid_row` and `c >= mid_col` (Top-Right): Set the output grid pixel at (`r`, `c`) to `TR_color`.
        *   If `r >= mid_row` and `c < mid_col` (Bottom-Left): Set the output grid pixel at (`r`, `c`) to `BL_color`.
        *   If `r >= mid_row` and `c >= mid_col` (Bottom-Right): Set the output grid pixel at (`r`, `c`) to `BR_color`.
    *   If the pixel color is neither White (0) nor Azure (8), the corresponding output pixel remains White (0).
7.  **Return Output Grid:** The final populated grid is the result.
