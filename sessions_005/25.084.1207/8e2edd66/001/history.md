**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a small input grid (always 3x3 in the examples) into a larger output grid (always 9x9). The output grid seems to be constructed by replacing each pixel of the input grid with a 3x3 block. The content of this 3x3 block depends on the color of the corresponding input pixel. If the input pixel is white (0), the corresponding 3x3 block in the output is entirely white (0). If the input pixel is non-white (azure 8, maroon 9, or orange 7 in the examples), the corresponding 3x3 block in the output is a copy of the *entire original input grid*.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Transform an input grid by scaling it up, where each original pixel determines the content of a subgrid in the output.
grid_properties:
  - input_grid_size: Fixed 3x3 in examples.
  - output_grid_size: Fixed 9x9 in examples.
  - size_relation: Output dimensions are 3 times the input dimensions (H_out = H_in * H_in, W_out = W_in * W_in). Seems H_out = 3 * H_in, W_out = 3 * W_in is more accurate based on the 3x3 -> 9x9 structure and the block replacement logic. Let's stick to Output dimensions = Input dimensions * 3.
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer 0-9 (white=0, azure=8, maroon=9, orange=7 in examples)
      - position: (row, column)
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: (height, width)
      - pixels: 2D array of pixel colors
transformation_rule:
  - name: Block Replacement
    input: Input Grid Pixel at (r, c) with color P
    output: Output Grid 3x3 Block starting at (r*3, c*3)
    conditions:
      - if P == 0 (white):
          fill_block_with: 0 (white)
      - if P != 0 (non-white):
          fill_block_with: copy of the entire original Input Grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid. (In the examples, H=3, W=3).
2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions (H * 3) x (W * 3). Initialize it with white (0) pixels. (In the examples, this is 9x9).
3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at position (row `r`, column `c`), from `r=0` to `H-1` and `c=0` to `W-1`.
4.  Examine the color of the input pixel `input[r][c]`.
5.  If the input pixel `input[r][c]` is white (0), the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid (from row `r*3` to `r*3 + 2` and column `c*3` to `c*3 + 2`) remains filled with white (0).
6.  If the input pixel `input[r][c]` is non-white, copy the *entire original input grid* into the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid (from row `r*3` to `r*3 + 2` and column `c*3` to `c*3 + 2`).
