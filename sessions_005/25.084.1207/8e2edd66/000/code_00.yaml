task_description: Transform an input grid by scaling it up, where each original pixel determines the content of a subgrid in the output.
grid_properties:
  - input_grid_size: Fixed 3x3 in examples.
  - output_grid_size: Fixed 9x9 in examples.
  - size_relation: Output dimensions are 3 times the input dimensions (H_out = H_in * H_in, W_out = W_in * W_in). Seems H_out = 3 * H_in, W_out = 3 * W_in is more accurate based on the 3x3 -> 9x9 structure and the block replacement logic. Let's stick to Output dimensions = Input dimensions * 3.
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer 0-9 (white=0, azure=8, maroon=9, orange=7 in examples)
      - position: (row, column)
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: (height, width)
      - pixels: 2D array of pixel colors
transformation_rule:
  - name: Block Replacement
    input: Input Grid Pixel at (r, c) with color P
    output: Output Grid 3x3 Block starting at (r*3, c*3)
    conditions:
      - if P == 0 (white):
          fill_block_with: 0 (white)
      - if P != 0 (non-white):
          fill_block_with: copy of the entire original Input Grid
