Context:
  Input_Grid:
    - Contains pixels of two colors: white (0) and gray (5).
    - Gray pixels form contiguous objects.
  Output_Grid:
    - Contains only white (0) pixels.
    - Always has a width of 1 column.
    - Height varies based on the input.

Objects:
  - Type: Gray Clusters
  - Definition: A set of gray (5) pixels where every pixel is connected to at least one other pixel in the set, considering horizontal, vertical, and diagonal adjacency (8-way connectivity).
  - Property: The number of distinct gray objects present in the input grid.

Transformation:
  - Action: Identify and count the distinct gray objects in the input grid.
  - Rule: Determine the height of the output grid based on the count of objects.
  - Output_Generation: Create a grid filled with white pixels.

Relationship:
  - Output_Height = count(Distinct_Gray_Objects) + 1
  - Output_Width = 1
  - Output_Pixel_Value = 0 (white)
