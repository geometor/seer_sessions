            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Analysis**: The input grids consist of two colors: white (0) and gray (5). The gray pixels form distinct, connected clusters or \"objects\". These objects vary in shape and size across the examples.\n2.  **Output Grid Analysis**: The output grids are always a single column wide. They consist entirely of white (0) pixels. The height of the output grid varies between examples.\n3.  **Transformation Clues**: The primary transformation seems to involve counting something in the input grid to determine the height of the output grid. Given the presence of distinct gray objects, the count of these objects is the most likely candidate.\n4.  **Object Definition**: Based on the examples, an \"object\" appears to be a group of gray (5) pixels where each pixel in the group is connected to at least one other pixel in the group either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (8-way connectivity).\n5.  **Relationship Discovery**:\n    *   Example 1: Input has 2 distinct gray objects. Output height is 3.\n    *   Example 2: Input has 1 distinct gray object. Output height is 2.\n    *   Example 3: Input has 4 distinct gray objects. Output height is 5.\n    *   Example 4: Input has 3 distinct gray objects. Output height is 4.\n    This strongly suggests a consistent relationship: the height of the output grid is equal to the number of distinct gray objects found in the input grid, plus one.\n6.  **Output Content**: The content of the output grid is consistently white (0), regardless of the input grid's contents other than the object count.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
