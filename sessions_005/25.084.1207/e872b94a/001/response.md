Transformation Rule:
1. Identify all distinct objects formed by connected gray (5) pixels in the input grid, using 8-way connectivity (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal adjacency).
2. Count the total number of these distinct gray objects.
3. Create an output grid with a width of 1 and a height equal to the count of gray objects plus one.
4. Fill the entire output grid with white (0) pixels.
