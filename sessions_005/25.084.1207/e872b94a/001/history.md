Okay, let's analyze the task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Analysis**: The input grids consist of two colors: white (0) and gray (5). The gray pixels form distinct, connected clusters or "objects". These objects vary in shape and size across the examples.
2.  **Output Grid Analysis**: The output grids are always a single column wide. They consist entirely of white (0) pixels. The height of the output grid varies between examples.
3.  **Transformation Clues**: The primary transformation seems to involve counting something in the input grid to determine the height of the output grid. Given the presence of distinct gray objects, the count of these objects is the most likely candidate.
4.  **Object Definition**: Based on the examples, an "object" appears to be a group of gray (5) pixels where each pixel in the group is connected to at least one other pixel in the group either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (8-way connectivity).
5.  **Relationship Discovery**:
    *   Example 1: Input has 2 distinct gray objects. Output height is 3.
    *   Example 2: Input has 1 distinct gray object. Output height is 2.
    *   Example 3: Input has 4 distinct gray objects. Output height is 5.
    *   Example 4: Input has 3 distinct gray objects. Output height is 4.
    This strongly suggests a consistent relationship: the height of the output grid is equal to the number of distinct gray objects found in the input grid, plus one.
6.  **Output Content**: The content of the output grid is consistently white (0), regardless of the input grid's contents other than the object count.

**Facts**


```yaml
Context:
  Input_Grid:
    - Contains pixels of two colors: white (0) and gray (5).
    - Gray pixels form contiguous objects.
  Output_Grid:
    - Contains only white (0) pixels.
    - Always has a width of 1 column.
    - Height varies based on the input.

Objects:
  - Type: Gray Clusters
  - Definition: A set of gray (5) pixels where every pixel is connected to at least one other pixel in the set, considering horizontal, vertical, and diagonal adjacency (8-way connectivity).
  - Property: The number of distinct gray objects present in the input grid.

Transformation:
  - Action: Identify and count the distinct gray objects in the input grid.
  - Rule: Determine the height of the output grid based on the count of objects.
  - Output_Generation: Create a grid filled with white pixels.

Relationship:
  - Output_Height = count(Distinct_Gray_Objects) + 1
  - Output_Width = 1
  - Output_Pixel_Value = 0 (white)
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Scan the input grid to locate all gray (5) pixels.
2.  Identify distinct objects formed by connected gray pixels. Use 8-way connectivity (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally adjacent pixels belong to the same object).
3.  Count the total number of distinct gray objects identified in step 2.
4.  Calculate the required height for the output grid by adding 1 to the object count.
5.  Construct the output grid with dimensions: height = (object count + 1), width = 1.
6.  Fill every cell of the output grid with the white (0) color value.
