Input Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: H rows, W columns (variable, e.g., 8x8, 5x5, 7x7)
    - Content:
      - Background Pixels: Uniform color (e.g., yellow, orange, red) occupying most cells.
      - Obstacle Pixel: Exactly one pixel with a different color (e.g., maroon, azure, yellow).
        Properties:
          - Position: (row, column)
          - Color: Specific non-background color.
          - Role: Acts as an impassable barrier.

Output Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: Same as input grid (H rows, W columns).
    - Content:
      - Background Pixels: Retain original background color unless part of the path.
      - Obstacle Pixel: Retains original position and color from the input.
      - Path Pixels:
        - Color: Blue (1).
        - Location: Cells forming a path from top-left to bottom-right.
        - Properties: Represents the shortest Manhattan path, avoiding the obstacle pixel.

Transformation:
  Action: Pathfinding.
  Details:
    - Find the shortest path using only horizontal and vertical steps (Manhattan distance) from the top-left corner (0, 0) to the bottom-right corner (H-1, W-1).
    - Treat the location of the input obstacle pixel as an impassable cell during pathfinding.
    - Change the color of all cells belonging to the found path to blue (1), except for the obstacle cell itself (which remains unchanged).
    - All other cells retain their original colors from the input grid.
