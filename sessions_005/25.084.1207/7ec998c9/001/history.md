Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples involve a rectangular grid filled mostly with a single background color.
2.  **Unique Pixel:** Each input grid contains exactly one pixel that is different from the background color. Let's call this the "obstacle" pixel. Its position varies across examples.
3.  **Output Changes:** The output grid retains the original dimensions, the background color in most places, and the obstacle pixel at its original location and color. The key change is the introduction of several blue (1) pixels.
4.  **Blue Pixel Pattern:** The blue pixels appear to form a connected path. In all examples, this path starts at the top-left corner (0, 0) and ends at the bottom-right corner (H-1, W-1).
5.  **Path and Obstacle Interaction:** The path seems to represent the shortest route between the start and end corners, using only horizontal and vertical moves (Manhattan path). Critically, the path detours or navigates *around* the obstacle pixel. The obstacle pixel itself is never colored blue; it retains its original color.
6.  **Consistency:** The background color and the obstacle color change between examples (yellow/maroon, orange/azure, red/yellow), but the core logic (finding a path around the obstacle and coloring it blue) remains consistent.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: H rows, W columns (variable, e.g., 8x8, 5x5, 7x7)
    - Content:
      - Background Pixels: Uniform color (e.g., yellow, orange, red) occupying most cells.
      - Obstacle Pixel: Exactly one pixel with a different color (e.g., maroon, azure, yellow).
        Properties:
          - Position: (row, column)
          - Color: Specific non-background color.
          - Role: Acts as an impassable barrier.

Output Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: Same as input grid (H rows, W columns).
    - Content:
      - Background Pixels: Retain original background color unless part of the path.
      - Obstacle Pixel: Retains original position and color from the input.
      - Path Pixels:
        - Color: Blue (1).
        - Location: Cells forming a path from top-left to bottom-right.
        - Properties: Represents the shortest Manhattan path, avoiding the obstacle pixel.

Transformation:
  Action: Pathfinding.
  Details:
    - Find the shortest path using only horizontal and vertical steps (Manhattan distance) from the top-left corner (0, 0) to the bottom-right corner (H-1, W-1).
    - Treat the location of the input obstacle pixel as an impassable cell during pathfinding.
    - Change the color of all cells belonging to the found path to blue (1), except for the obstacle cell itself (which remains unchanged).
    - All other cells retain their original colors from the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Determine the grid's height (H) and width (W).
3.  Identify the background color (the color of the pixel at (0,0), assuming it's not the obstacle, or otherwise the most frequent color).
4.  Locate the coordinates (obstacle_row, obstacle_col) and the color of the single pixel that is not the background color (the obstacle).
5.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
6.  Perform a shortest path search (like Breadth-First Search or A* using Manhattan distance) from the starting cell (0, 0) to the target cell (H-1, W-1).
7.  During the search, consider the cell at (obstacle_row, obstacle_col) as blocked or impassable. Only allow movement to adjacent (up, down, left, right) cells within the grid boundaries that are not the obstacle.
8.  Once the shortest path is found, retrieve the sequence of cells that constitute this path.
9.  Iterate through each cell (r, c) in the shortest path sequence.
10. If the cell (r, c) is *not* the obstacle cell (i.e., (r, c) is not equal to (obstacle_row, obstacle_col)), update the color of the cell at (r, c) in the output grid to blue (1).
11. Return the final output grid.
