task_description: Create a border around the grid using the color of the single non-white pixel found in the input.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_match: Input and output grids have the same height and width.

input_elements:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
    description: The predominant color in the input grid.
  - element: source_pixel
    count: 1
    color: non-white (varies: 1, 2, 3, 6)
    description: A single pixel with a color other than white.
    location: variable, often near the center.

output_elements:
  - element: border
    thickness: 1 pixel
    location: perimeter of the grid (row 0, last row, column 0, last column)
    color: Same as the input source_pixel color.
    description: A frame around the edge of the output grid.
  - element: interior
    color: white (0)
    location: All pixels not part of the border.
    description: The area inside the border.

transformation:
  - step: Identify the dimensions (height H, width W) of the input grid.
  - step: Find the single non-white pixel in the input grid and determine its color (C).
  - step: Create a new grid of dimensions H x W, initially filled with white (0).
  - step: Set the color of all pixels in the first row (row 0) to C.
  - step: Set the color of all pixels in the last row (row H-1) to C.
  - step: Set the color of all pixels in the first column (column 0) to C.
  - step: Set the color of all pixels in the last column (column W-1) to C.
  - result: The final grid has a border of color C and a white interior.
