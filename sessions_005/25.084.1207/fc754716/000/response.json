The color of this single pixel varies across examples (`blue`, `green`, `magenta`, `red`). Its position also varies but tends to be near the center.\n2.  **Output Grid:** Each output grid has the same dimensions as the corresponding input grid. It features a border of thickness 1 pixel around its perimeter. The color of this border matches the color of the single non-`white` pixel found in the input grid. All pixels inside this border are `white` (0).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation identifies the unique non-`white` color in the input and uses it to draw a frame or border on an otherwise `white` grid of the same size. The original position or color of the central pixel in the input grid does not seem to affect the *interior* pixels of the output grid; they are always set to `white`.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
