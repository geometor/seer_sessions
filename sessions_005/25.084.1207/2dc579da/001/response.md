"""
Extracts a subgrid from the input based on the position of a unique pixel 
relative to intersecting lines.

1. Identify the background color (most frequent).
2. Identify the line color (second most frequent).
3. Find the row and column indices (line_r, line_c) where the lines of the line color intersect.
4. Identify the unique pixel color (least frequent, appears once) and its coordinates (unique_r, unique_c).
5. If the unique pixel is in the top-left quadrant relative to the intersection (unique_r < line_r AND unique_c < line_c):
   - The output is the subgrid from the top-left corner (0, 0) up to, but not including, the intersection point (rows 0 to line_r-1, columns 0 to line_c-1).
6. Else (unique pixel is in another quadrant):
   - The output is the 3x3 neighborhood centered around the unique pixel, clipped to the input grid's boundaries.
