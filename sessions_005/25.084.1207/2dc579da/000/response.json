            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both inputs and outputs are rectangular grids of colored pixels. The output grid is always smaller than or equal to the input grid.\n2.  **Color Palette:** Each example uses exactly three distinct colors.\n3.  **Key Features in Input:**\n    *   **Background:** There's a dominant color that fills most of the grid space.\n    *   **Lines:** There's a single horizontal line and a single vertical line of the same color, intersecting somewhere in the grid. This \"line color\" is different from the background color.\n    *   **Unique Pixel:** There is exactly one pixel whose color is different from both the background and the lines.\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The task seems to involve selecting a specific portion of the input grid based on the relative positions of the unique pixel and the intersection point of the lines.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input 7x7. Background yellow (4). Lines red (2) at row 3, col 3. Unique pixel blue (1) at (1, 5). Output 3x3. The unique pixel (1, 5) is in the top-right quadrant relative to the intersection (3, 3). The output is the 3x3 neighborhood around the unique pixel.\n*   **Example 2:** Input 5x5. Background azure (8). Lines green (3) at row 2, col 2. Unique pixel yellow (4) at (4, 0). Output 2x2. The unique pixel (4, 0) is in the bottom-left quadrant relative to the intersection (2, 2). The output is the 3x3 neighborhood around the unique pixel, but clipped because the pixel is near the edge, resulting in a 2x2 grid.\n*   **Example 3:** Input 11x11. Background green (3). Lines blue (1) at row 5, col 5. Unique pixel azure (8) at (2, 1). Output 5x5. The unique pixel (2, 1) is in the top-left quadrant relative to the intersection (5, 5). The output is the subgrid from the top-left corner of the input up to (but not including) the intersecting lines (rows 0-4, columns 0-4).\n\n**Synthesized Rule:**\n\nThe transformation depends on the location of the single unique pixel relative to the intersection point of the two lines.\n\n1.  Identify the background color (most frequent).\n2.  Identify the line color (second most frequent) and the row/column indices of the lines (`line_r`, `line_c`).\n3.  Identify the unique pixel color (least frequent, appears once) and its coordinates (`unique_r`, `unique_c`).\n4.  Compare the unique pixel's coordinates to the line intersection coordinates.\n5.  If the unique pixel is in the top-left quadrant (`unique_r < line_r` and `unique_c < line_c`), the output is the rectangular subgrid defined by the top-left corner of the input and the intersection point (exclusive).\n6.  Otherwise (if the unique pixel is in the top-right, bottom-left, or bottom-right quadrant), the output is the 3x3 neighborhood surrounding the unique pixel, clipped to the boundaries of the input grid.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
