            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of colored pixels. The size varies between examples.\n2.  **Background:** Each example has a dominant background color (Blue=1 in Ex1, Azure=8 in Ex2, Green=3 in Ex3) which remains unchanged in the output grid.\n3.  **Objects:** There are distinct objects composed of connected pixels of non-background colors. These objects retain their shape and internal colors in the output.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is a horizontal shift (translation) of these objects. The background pixels do not move.\n5.  **Shift Amount (S):** The number of columns objects shift seems to depend on specific colors present *anywhere* in the input grid:\n    *   If Green (3) is present, the shift amount S = 7. (Ex 2)\n    *   Else if Yellow (4) is present, the shift amount S = 4. (Ex 1)\n    *   Else if Red (2) is present, the shift amount S = 2. (Ex 3)\n6.  **Shift Direction:** The direction (left or right) depends on the object's horizontal position relative to vertical divisions of the grid. The *number* of divisions (N) also seems linked to the color determining the shift amount:\n    *   If Green (3) is present (N=3 divisions, S=7): Objects fully in the left third shift right (+S). Objects fully in the middle or right thirds shift left (-S).\n    *   If Yellow (4) is present (N=2 divisions, S=4): Objects fully in the left half shift right (+S). Objects fully in the right half shift left (-S).\n    *   If Red (2) is present (N=2 divisions, S=2): Objects fully in the left half shift right (+S). Objects fully in the right half shift left (-S).\n7.  **Spanning Objects:** Objects whose horizontal extent (bounding box) crosses the boundary between these defined regions consistently shift left (-S) in all examples observed.\n8.  **Boundaries:** Pixels shifted beyond the grid boundaries horizontally appear to be discarded (no wrapping).\n9.  **Overlaps:** The examples don't clearly show how overlaps after shifting are handled, but since objects retain their internal structure, it seems pixels are just copied to their new locations, potentially overwriting existing pixels (or background).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Check if the color Green (3) exists anywhere in the input grid. If yes, set the number of regions N = 3 and the shift amount S = 7.\n    b. If Green (3) is not present, check if Yellow (4) exists anywhere. If yes, set N = 2 and S = 4.\n    c. If neither Green (3) nor Yellow (4) is present, check if Red (2) exists anywhere. If yes, set N = 2 and S = 2.\n    d. (Assumption: At least one of Green, Yellow, or Red will be present to define the shift).\n3.  **Define Regions:** Calculate the column ranges for the Left, Middle (if N=3), and Right regions based on the grid width (W) and the value of N (using integer division for boundaries).\n4.  **Identify Objects:** Find all connected components (objects) consisting of non-background pixels in the input grid. For each object, determine its horizontal bounding box (minimum and maximum column index).\n5.  **Calculate Shifts for Each Object:**\n    a. For each object:\n        i.  Determine which region(s) its bounding box occupies or spans.\n        ii. If the bounding box is entirely within the Left region, the horizontal shift is `+S` (Right).\n        iii. If N=2 and the bounding box is entirely within the Right region, the shift is `-S` (Left).\n        iv. If N=3 and the bounding box is entirely within the Middle region, the shift is `-S` (Left).\n        v.  If N=3 and the bounding box is entirely within the Right region, the shift is `-S` (Left).\n        vi. If the bounding box spans across any region boundary, the shift is `-S` (Left).\n6.  **Construct Output Grid:**\n    a. Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.\n    b. For each object identified in step 4:\n        i.  Calculate its target position by applying its determined horizontal shift (from step 5) to the coordinates of each of its pixels.\n        ii. For each pixel of the object, if its new column coordinate is within the grid boundaries (0 to W-1), copy the pixel's original color to the corresponding row and new column in the output grid. Overwrite any existing pixel (background or from a previously processed object) at that location.\n7.  **Return Output Grid:** The final constructed grid is the result."
