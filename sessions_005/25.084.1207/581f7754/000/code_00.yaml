grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  cell_values: integers 0-9 (colors)
  size_range: 1x1 to 30x30

# Key Elements and Properties
background:
  definition: The most frequent pixel color in the input grid.
  behavior: Remains static in the output grid.
objects:
  definition: Contiguous block(s) of non-background pixels.
  properties:
    - color: The color(s) making up the object.
    - shape: The spatial arrangement of the object's pixels.
    - position: Location within the grid, often represented by a bounding box.
  behavior:
    - retain_shape: Yes
    - retain_color: Yes
    - movement: Horizontal translation only.

# Transformation Details
transformation_name: conditional_regional_horizontal_shift
parameters:
  shift_amount_S:
    determination: Based on the presence of specific colors (priority order) in the input grid.
    rules:
      - if Green(3) exists: S = 7
      - else if Yellow(4) exists: S = 4
      - else if Red(2) exists: S = 2
  number_of_regions_N:
    determination: Based on the color that determined S.
    rules:
      - if Green(3) determined S: N = 3
      - else if Yellow(4) determined S: N = 2
      - else if Red(2) determined S: N = 2
  grid_width_W: The number of columns in the input grid.
  regions:
    definition: Vertical sections of the grid based on N and W. Columns are 0-indexed.
    calculation:
      - if N=2: Left=[0, floor(W/2)-1], Right=[floor(W/2), W-1]
      - if N=3: Left=[0, floor(W/3)-1], Middle=[floor(W/3), floor(2W/3)-1], Right=[floor(2W/3), W-1]
  shift_direction:
    determination: Based on object's bounding box horizontal position relative to regions.
    rules:
      - if object bounding_box_cols fully within Left region: shift Right (+S)
      - if N=2 and object bounding_box_cols fully within Right region: shift Left (-S)
      - if N=3 and object bounding_box_cols fully within Middle region: shift Left (-S)
      - if N=3 and object bounding_box_cols fully within Right region: shift Left (-S)
      - if object bounding_box_cols spans across region boundaries: shift Left (-S)

# Boundary and Overlap Handling
boundary_handling: Pixels shifted outside the grid width are discarded.
overlap_handling: Assumed that shifted pixels overwrite the destination cells.
