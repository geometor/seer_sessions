task_description: Crop the input grid based on the first complete row and column matching the border color.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors (0-9).
  - element: border_color
    description: The color of the pixel at the top-left corner (0,0). This color typically forms the outermost frame of the input grid.
  - element: horizontal_boundary_line
    description: The first row in the input grid, starting from the top (row 0), that consists entirely of the border_color.
    property: index_H
  - element: vertical_boundary_line
    description: The first column in the input grid, starting from the left (column 0), that consists entirely of the border_color.
    property: index_W
  - element: output_grid
    description: The resulting grid after transformation.

actions:
  - action: identify_border_color
    input: input_grid
    output: border_color
    description: Get the color of the pixel at coordinates (0, 0).
  - action: find_horizontal_boundary
    input: input_grid, border_color
    output: index_H
    description: Iterate through rows from top to bottom. Return the index of the first row where all pixels match the border_color.
  - action: find_vertical_boundary
    input: input_grid, border_color
    output: index_W
    description: Iterate through columns from left to right. Return the index of the first column where all pixels match the border_color.
  - action: crop_grid
    input: input_grid, index_H, index_W
    output: output_grid
    description: Extract the subgrid from the input_grid starting at row 0 up to and including row index_H, and from column 0 up to and including column index_W.

relationships:
  - The output_grid dimensions are determined by index_H and index_W.
  - The output_grid height is (index_H + 1).
  - The output_grid width is (index_W + 1).
  - The output_grid is the top-left portion of the input_grid defined by these boundaries.
