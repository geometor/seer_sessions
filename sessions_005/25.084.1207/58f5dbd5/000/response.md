Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both inputs and outputs are rectangular grids of colored pixels.
2.  **Border Color:** Each input grid has a distinct border color that frames the entire grid (azure in example 1, yellow in example 2, blue in example 3). This border color is consistently the color found at the top-left corner (0,0).
3.  **Internal Structures:** Inside the border, there are various shapes and blocks composed of different colors. Some of these internal structures might contain pixels matching the border color, but they don't form complete lines spanning the grid width or height until a certain point.
4.  **Transformation:** The output grid is always a subgrid (a cropped section) of the input grid, specifically the top-left portion.
5.  **Cropping Boundaries:** The size of the output grid (the cropping boundary) seems determined by the first occurrence of a row and a column composed entirely of the border color.
    *   In example 1 (azure border), the first all-azure row is row 18 (index), and the first all-azure column is column 6 (index). The output is the input cropped to rows 0-18 and columns 0-6 (19x7).
    *   In example 2 (yellow border), the first all-yellow row is row 6 (index), and the first all-yellow column is column 18 (index). The output is the input cropped to rows 0-6 and columns 0-18 (7x19).
    *   In example 3 (blue border), the first all-blue row is row 12 (index), and the first all-blue column is column 12 (index). The output is the input cropped to rows 0-12 and columns 0-12 (13x13).

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: Crop the input grid based on the first complete row and column matching the border color.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors (0-9).
  - element: border_color
    description: The color of the pixel at the top-left corner (0,0). This color typically forms the outermost frame of the input grid.
  - element: horizontal_boundary_line
    description: The first row in the input grid, starting from the top (row 0), that consists entirely of the border_color.
    property: index_H
  - element: vertical_boundary_line
    description: The first column in the input grid, starting from the left (column 0), that consists entirely of the border_color.
    property: index_W
  - element: output_grid
    description: The resulting grid after transformation.

actions:
  - action: identify_border_color
    input: input_grid
    output: border_color
    description: Get the color of the pixel at coordinates (0, 0).
  - action: find_horizontal_boundary
    input: input_grid, border_color
    output: index_H
    description: Iterate through rows from top to bottom. Return the index of the first row where all pixels match the border_color.
  - action: find_vertical_boundary
    input: input_grid, border_color
    output: index_W
    description: Iterate through columns from left to right. Return the index of the first column where all pixels match the border_color.
  - action: crop_grid
    input: input_grid, index_H, index_W
    output: output_grid
    description: Extract the subgrid from the input_grid starting at row 0 up to and including row index_H, and from column 0 up to and including column index_W.

relationships:
  - The output_grid dimensions are determined by index_H and index_W.
  - The output_grid height is (index_H + 1).
  - The output_grid width is (index_W + 1).
  - The output_grid is the top-left portion of the input_grid defined by these boundaries.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the `border_color` by examining the color of the pixel at the top-left corner (row 0, column 0) of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid row by row, starting from row 0. Identify the index (`H`) of the first row where every pixel in that row has the `border_color`.
3.  Scan the input grid column by column, starting from column 0. Identify the index (`W`) of the first column where every pixel in that column has the `border_color`.
4.  Create the output grid by taking a subgrid (cropping) of the input grid. The subgrid includes all rows from 0 up to and including row `H`, and all columns from 0 up to and including column `W`.
