            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both inputs and outputs are rectangular grids of colored pixels.\n2.  **Border Color:** Each input grid has a distinct border color that frames the entire grid (azure in example 1, yellow in example 2, blue in example 3). This border color is consistently the color found at the top-left corner (0,0).\n3.  **Internal Structures:** Inside the border, there are various shapes and blocks composed of different colors. Some of these internal structures might contain pixels matching the border color, but they don't form complete lines spanning the grid width or height until a certain point.\n4.  **Transformation:** The output grid is always a subgrid (a cropped section) of the input grid, specifically the top-left portion.\n5.  **Cropping Boundaries:** The size of the output grid (the cropping boundary) seems determined by the first occurrence of a row and a column composed entirely of the border color.\n    *   In example 1 (azure border), the first all-azure row is row 18 (index), and the first all-azure column is column 6 (index). The output is the input cropped to rows 0-18 and columns 0-6 (19x7).\n    *   In example 2 (yellow border), the first all-yellow row is row 6 (index), and the first all-yellow column is column 18 (index). The output is the input cropped to rows 0-6 and columns 0-18 (7x19).\n    *   In example 3 (blue border), the first all-blue row is row 12 (index), and the first all-blue column is column 12 (index). The output is the input cropped to rows 0-12 and columns 0-12 (13x13).\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
