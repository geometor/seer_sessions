            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid is consistently 4 rows high and 9 columns wide.\n2.  **Divider:** A vertical column of gray (5) pixels is always present in the 5th column (index 4). This column acts as a separator.\n3.  **Subgrids:** The gray divider splits the input grid into two distinct 4x4 subgrids:\n    *   A \"left grid\" (columns 0-3).\n    *   A \"right grid\" (columns 5-8).\n4.  **Output Grid Structure:** Each output grid is 4 rows high and 4 columns wide, matching the dimensions of the input subgrids.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The output grid appears to be derived from the left and right input subgrids. There seems to be a conditional logic involved.\n    *   In some cases (e.g., train_1, train_3, train_5, train_7), the output looks like the left grid, but its white (0) pixels are \"filled in\" or replaced by the corresponding non-white pixels from the right grid.\n    *   In other cases (e.g., train_2, train_4, train_6), the output is simply an exact copy of the left grid.\n6.  **Condition Identification:** The key difference seems to be whether any non-white pixels in the left grid occupy the *same position* as any non-white pixels in the right grid.\n    *   If there is **no overlap** of non-white pixels between the left and right grids, the \"fill-in\" or overlay operation occurs.\n    *   If there **is overlap** of non-white pixels, the output is just the left grid, ignoring the right grid entirely.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Extract the 4x4 subgrid to the left of the gray line (columns 0-3). Call this `LeftGrid`.\n3.  Extract the 4x4 subgrid to the right of the gray line (columns 5-8). Call this `RightGrid`.\n4.  Determine if there is any spatial overlap between the non-white pixels of `LeftGrid` and `RightGrid`. To do this, check every cell position `(row, col)` from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`: if `LeftGrid[row, col]` is not white (0) and `RightGrid[row, col]` is also not white (0) for *any* position, then an overlap exists.\n5.  **If an overlap exists:** The final output grid is an exact copy of `LeftGrid`.\n6.  **If no overlap exists:**\n    a.  Create the initial output grid as a copy of `LeftGrid`.\n    b.  Iterate through each cell `(row, col)` of the output grid (from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`).\n    c.  For the current cell `(row, col)`, check if its value in the output grid (which currently matches `LeftGrid`) is white (0).\n    d.  If the output grid cell is white (0), check the value of the corresponding cell `RightGrid[row, col]`.\n    e.  If `RightGrid[row, col]` is *not* white (0), update the output grid cell `(row, col)` with the value from `RightGrid[row, col]`.\n    f.  If the output grid cell was not white (0) initially, or if the corresponding `RightGrid` cell *was* white (0), leave the output grid cell unchanged.\n7.
