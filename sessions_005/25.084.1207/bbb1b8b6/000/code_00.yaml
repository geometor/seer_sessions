Relationship: Overlap Check
  - Compares pixel positions between Left Subgrid and Right Subgrid.
  - Definition: Overlap exists if there is at least one cell (row, col) where BOTH Left_Subgrid[row, col] is not white (0) AND Right_Subgrid[row, col] is not white (0).

TransformationRule:
  Condition: Based on Overlap Check result.
  Action_If_Overlap: OutputGrid is a direct copy of Left Subgrid.
  Action_If_No_Overlap:
    - Start with OutputGrid as a copy of Left Subgrid.
    - For each cell (row, col) in OutputGrid:
      - If OutputGrid[row, col] is white (0) AND Right_Subgrid[row, col] is not white (0):
        - Set OutputGrid[row, col] = Right_Subgrid[row, col].
