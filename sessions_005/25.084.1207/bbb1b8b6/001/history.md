Okay, let's analyze the task.

## Perception

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid is consistently 4 rows high and 9 columns wide.
2.  **Divider:** A vertical column of gray (5) pixels is always present in the 5th column (index 4). This column acts as a separator.
3.  **Subgrids:** The gray divider splits the input grid into two distinct 4x4 subgrids:
    *   A "left grid" (columns 0-3).
    *   A "right grid" (columns 5-8).
4.  **Output Grid Structure:** Each output grid is 4 rows high and 4 columns wide, matching the dimensions of the input subgrids.
5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The output grid appears to be derived from the left and right input subgrids. There seems to be a conditional logic involved.
    *   In some cases (e.g., train_1, train_3, train_5, train_7), the output looks like the left grid, but its white (0) pixels are "filled in" or replaced by the corresponding non-white pixels from the right grid.
    *   In other cases (e.g., train_2, train_4, train_6), the output is simply an exact copy of the left grid.
6.  **Condition Identification:** The key difference seems to be whether any non-white pixels in the left grid occupy the *same position* as any non-white pixels in the right grid.
    *   If there is **no overlap** of non-white pixels between the left and right grids, the "fill-in" or overlay operation occurs.
    *   If there **is overlap** of non-white pixels, the output is just the left grid, ignoring the right grid entirely.

## Facts


```yaml
InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Height: 4
    - Width: 9
  Structure:
    - Contains a Divider column.
    - Contains a Left Subgrid.
    - Contains a Right Subgrid.

Divider:
  Type: Object
  Properties:
    - Color: gray (5)
    - Shape: Vertical line (4x1)
    - Position: Column index 4
  Function: Separates InputGrid into Left and Right Subgrids.

Left Subgrid:
  Type: Object (Grid)
  Properties:
    - Source: InputGrid columns 0-3
    - Height: 4
    - Width: 4

Right Subgrid:
  Type: Object (Grid)
  Properties:
    - Source: InputGrid columns 5-8
    - Height: 4
    - Width: 4

OutputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Height: 4
    - Width: 4

Relationship: Overlap Check
  - Compares pixel positions between Left Subgrid and Right Subgrid.
  - Definition: Overlap exists if there is at least one cell (row, col) where BOTH Left_Subgrid[row, col] is not white (0) AND Right_Subgrid[row, col] is not white (0).

TransformationRule:
  Condition: Based on Overlap Check result.
  Action_If_Overlap: OutputGrid is a direct copy of Left Subgrid.
  Action_If_No_Overlap:
    - Start with OutputGrid as a copy of Left Subgrid.
    - For each cell (row, col) in OutputGrid:
      - If OutputGrid[row, col] is white (0) AND Right_Subgrid[row, col] is not white (0):
        - Set OutputGrid[row, col] = Right_Subgrid[row, col].
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the vertical gray (5) line in the input grid, located at column index 4.
2.  Extract the 4x4 subgrid to the left of the gray line (columns 0-3). Call this `LeftGrid`.
3.  Extract the 4x4 subgrid to the right of the gray line (columns 5-8). Call this `RightGrid`.
4.  Determine if there is any spatial overlap between the non-white pixels of `LeftGrid` and `RightGrid`. To do this, check every cell position `(row, col)` from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`: if `LeftGrid[row, col]` is not white (0) and `RightGrid[row, col]` is also not white (0) for *any* position, then an overlap exists.
5.  **If an overlap exists:** The final output grid is an exact copy of `LeftGrid`.
6.  **If no overlap exists:**
    a.  Create the initial output grid as a copy of `LeftGrid`.
    b.  Iterate through each cell `(row, col)` of the output grid (from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`).
    c.  For the current cell `(row, col)`, check if its value in the output grid (which currently matches `LeftGrid`) is white (0).
    d.  If the output grid cell is white (0), check the value of the corresponding cell `RightGrid[row, col]`.
    e.  If `RightGrid[row, col]` is *not* white (0), update the output grid cell `(row, col)` with the value from `RightGrid[row, col]`.
    f.  If the output grid cell was not white (0) initially, or if the corresponding `RightGrid` cell *was* white (0), leave the output grid cell unchanged.
7.  The resulting grid after performing step 5 or step 6 is the final output.
