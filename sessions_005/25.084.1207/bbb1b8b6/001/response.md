1. Identify the vertical gray (5) line separator at column index 4.
2. Extract the 4x4 subgrid to the left (cols 0-3) as LeftGrid.
3. Extract the 4x4 subgrid to the right (cols 5-8) as RightGrid.
4. Check for spatial overlap of non-white (non-0) pixels between LeftGrid and RightGrid. Overlap occurs if for any position (row, col), both LeftGrid[row, col] != 0 and RightGrid[row, col] != 0.
5. If overlap exists, the output is a direct copy of LeftGrid.
6. If no overlap exists, the output is LeftGrid with its white (0) pixels replaced by the corresponding non-white pixels from RightGrid.
