White '0' pixels serve as the background. In all examples, there are exactly three colored objects.\n2.  **Output Grids:** The outputs are smaller grids containing just *one* of the objects from the corresponding input grid.\n3.  **Transformation:** The process seems to involve selecting one specific object from the input and isolating it in the output.\n4.  **Object Selection:** Comparing the objects in the input and the single object in the output across examples:\n    *   Example 1: Azure (7 pixels), Orange (5 pixels), Red (4 pixels) -> Output is Azure.\n    *   Example 2: Magenta (3 pixels), Green (4 pixels), Yellow (6 pixels) -> Output is Yellow.\n    *   Example 3: Orange (3 pixels), Red (6 pixels), Azure (4 pixels) -> Output is Red.\n    *   Example 4: Red (7 pixels), Green (3 pixels), Blue (4 pixels) -> Output is Red.\n    The object selected appears to be the one with the largest area (greatest number of pixels).\n5.  **Output Formatting:** The selected object in the output grid retains its original shape and color. The output grid is cropped to the minimum bounding box required to contain the selected object. Background pixels (white '0') within this bounding box that were *not* part of the original selected object *are* included in the output if they are needed to maintain the object's shape (e.g., the hole in the Azure object in example 1).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
