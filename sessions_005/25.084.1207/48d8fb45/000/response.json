The output is always a smaller 3x3 grid.\n2.  **Key Elements:**\n    *   **Background:** White pixels (0).\n    *   **Marker Pixel:** A single gray pixel (5). Its position seems crucial.\n    *   **Pattern Pixels:** Pixels of a single color (e.g., yellow, blue, red) forming one or more distinct shapes or components, potentially disconnected. This color appears to be the most frequent non-white, non-gray color in the input.\n    *   **Output Grid:** A 3x3 grid extracted from the input, containing a portion of the input's pattern pixels and background pixels.\n3.  **Transformation Goal:** The task is to locate the gray marker pixel and use its position to identify which specific 3x3 region of the input grid should be extracted as the output. The selection seems based on proximity: the output 3x3 grid corresponds to the location of the pattern component 'closest' to the gray marker pixel.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify the color that appears most frequently; this is the 'pattern color'.\n3.  **Find Pattern Components:** Identify all connected groups of pixels (using 8-way adjacency, meaning pixels touching horizontally, vertically, or diagonally are part of the same group) that have the 'pattern color'.\n4.  **Calculate Distances to Marker:** For each identified pattern component, find the pixel within that component which has the smallest Manhattan distance (sum of absolute differences in row and column coordinates) to the gray marker pixel found in Step 1. Record this minimum distance for each component.\n5.  **Select Closest Component:** Choose the pattern component that has the overall smallest minimum distance to the gray marker pixel, as calculated in Step 4.\n6.  **Determine Extraction Origin:** Find the bounding box encompassing all pixels of the selected closest component. Record the coordinates (row, column) of the top-left corner of this bounding box.\n7.  **Extract 3x3 Grid:** Extract a 3x3 subgrid from the input grid, starting at the top-left coordinates determined in Step 6. This 3x3 subgrid is the final output."
