"""
Identifies all 3x3 subgrids in the input grid that consist entirely of non-background colors (Blue=1 or Azure=8). 
For each such candidate subgrid, it counts the number of Blue (1) pixels. 
Finally, it selects and returns the candidate subgrid that contains the maximum number of Blue pixels. 
Based on the provided examples, it's assumed this maximum count uniquely identifies a single subgrid.
