The patterns of interest are composed of Blue and Azure pixels.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The output 3x3 grid appears to be an exact copy of a specific 3x3 subgrid found within the input 9x9 grid.\n4.  **Identifying the Subgrid:** The key challenge is locating the correct 3x3 subgrid within the larger input grid.\n5.  **Subgrid Properties:** The target 3x3 subgrid in all examples consists *only* of non-white pixels (Blue and Azure).\n6.  **Subgrid Location Clue:** The target 3x3 subgrid is uniquely identifiable because it is the *only* 3x3 area composed entirely of non-white pixels that is completely surrounded by a one-pixel-thick border of white pixels (or the edges of the 9x9 input grid). Other 3x3 areas of non-white pixels exist, but they are not fully enclosed by white pixels or boundaries.\n\n## Facts YAML\n\n"

Iterate through all possible top-left corner positions (row `r`, column `c`) for a 3x3 subgrid within the 9x9 input grid. The valid range for `r` is 0 to 6, and for `c` is 0 to 6.\n4.  For each potential 3x3 subgrid starting at `(r, c)`:\n    a.  **Check Composition:** Verify if *all* pixels within this 3x3 subgrid (from `input[r:r+3, c:c+3]`) are *not* the background color. If any pixel is the background color, discard this subgrid and continue to the next position.\n    b.  **Check Border:** If the composition check passes, examine the 1-pixel thick border surrounding the 3x3 subgrid. This border includes:\n        i.   The row above the subgrid: `input[r-1, c:c+3]` (if `r > 0`).\n        ii.  The row below the subgrid: `input[r+3, c:c+3]` (if `r+3 < input_height`).\n        iii. The column left of the subgrid: `input[r:r+3, c-1]` (if `c > 0`).\n        iv.  The column right of the subgrid: `input[r:r+3, c+3]` (if `c+3 < input_width`).\n        v.   The four corner pixels: `input[r-1, c-1]`, `input[r-1, c+3]`, `input[r+3, c-1]`, `input[r+3, c+3]` (checking bounds for each).\n        Verify if *all* existing border pixels (those within the input grid boundaries) *are* the background color.\n    c.  **Identify Target:** If both the composition check (Step 4a) and the border check (Step 4b) pass, this is the target 3x3 subgrid. Store it. (Based on the examples, there should only be one such subgrid).\n5.  Once the target 3x3 subgrid is found, return it as the output grid."
