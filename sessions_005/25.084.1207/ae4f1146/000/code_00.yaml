task_context:
  description: "Extract a specific 3x3 pattern from a larger grid based on its composition and surrounding border."
  input_grid_size: [9, 9]
  output_grid_size: [3, 3]
  colors_used: [0, 1, 8] # White, Blue, Azure
  background_color: 0 # White

grid_elements:
  - element: background
    color: 0
    role: Fills most of the grid and defines borders.
  - element: pattern_pixels
    color: [1, 8] # Blue, Azure
    role: Form various shapes and the target subgrid.

objects:
  - object: target_subgrid
    description: "A 3x3 subgrid within the input grid."
    properties:
      - size: [3, 3]
      - composition: Contains only non-background colors (Blue=1, Azure=8).
      - border: Is completely surrounded by a 1-pixel thick border consisting only of the background color (White=0) or the main grid boundaries.
      - uniqueness: There is only one such subgrid in each input example.

actions:
  - action: find_target_subgrid
    description: "Iterate through all possible 3x3 subgrids in the input grid."
    conditions:
      - "Check if the subgrid contains only non-background colors."
      - "Check if the 1-pixel border surrounding the subgrid (including corners) consists entirely of the background color or grid boundaries."
    result: "Identify the unique 3x3 subgrid meeting both conditions."
  - action: extract_subgrid
    description: "Copy the pixels from the identified target_subgrid."
    input: coordinates of the target_subgrid
    output: the 3x3 output grid

transformation_goal:
  - "Identify the unique 3x3 non-background subgrid that is fully bordered by the background color or grid edges."
  - "Return this 3x3 subgrid as the output."
