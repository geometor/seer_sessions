It only works for example 4.\n\n**Re-evaluation:**\n\nLet's re-examine the found blocks and the expected outputs carefully.\n\n*   **Ex 1:**\n    *   Found blocks at: (0, 4), (1, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0)\n    *   Expected Output Origin: (4, 6) -> `[[8, 1, 8], [1, 1, 8], [1, 8, 1]]`\n    *   \"Bottom-most, right-most\" rule selected: (5, 0)\n*   **Ex 2:**\n    *   Found blocks at: (0, 1), (1, 5), (4, 2), (6, 6)\n    *   Expected Output Origin: (4, 2) -> `[[8, 1, 8], [1, 1, 8], [8, 8, 1]]`\n    *   \"Bottom-most, right-most\" rule selected: (6, 6)\n*   **Ex 3:**\n    *   Found blocks at: (0, 2), (1, 6), (4, 0), (5, 4)\n    *   Expected Output Origin: (1, 6) -> `[[8, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [8, 1, 8]]`\n    *   \"Bottom-most, right-most\" rule selected: (5, 4)\n*   **Ex 4:**\n    *   Found blocks at: (0, 0), (1, 4), (4, 1), (5, 6)\n    *   Expected Output Origin: (5, 6) -> `[[8, 1, 8], [1, 8, 1], [1, 8, 1]]`\n    *   \"Bottom-most, right-most\" rule selected: (5, 6) - Matches!\n\nOkay, the \"bottom-most, right-most\" rule applied to *all* 3x3 non-white blocks is incorrect.\n\nWhat if the original \"border\" condition *was* relevant, but perhaps applied differently or in conjunction with the non-white condition?\n\nLet's re-check the border condition for the *expected* output blocks:\n*   **Ex 1 (Expected @ 4, 6):** Border pixels (within grid): `input[3, 5:9]`=[0,0,0,0], `input[7, 5:9]`=[0,0,0,0], `input[3:8, 5]`=[0,0,0,0,0], `input[3:8, 9]`=Off-grid. **Border is all White/Off-grid.**\n*   **Ex 2 (Expected @ 4, 2):** Border pixels: `input[3, 1:6]`=[0,0,0,0,8], `input[7, 1:6]`=[0,0,0,0,0], `input[3:8, 1]`=[0,0,0,0,0], `input[3:8, 5]`=[8,0,0,0,0]. **Border contains non-white (8).**\n*   **Ex 3 (Expected @ 1, 6):** Border pixels: `input[0, 5:9]`=[0,0,0,0], `input[4, 5:9]`=[0,0,0,0], `input[0:5, 5]`=[0,0,0,0,0], `input[0:5, 9]`=Off-grid. **Border is all White/Off-grid.**\n*   **Ex 4 (Expected @ 5, 6):** Border pixels: `input[4, 5:9]`=[0,0,0,0], `input[8, 5:9]`=[0,0,0,0], `input[4:9, 5]`=[0,0,0,0,0], `input[4:9, 9]`=Off-grid. **Border is all White/Off-grid.**\n\nThis is inconsistent. Examples 1, 3, and 4 have the expected output block surrounded by white/off-grid. Example 2 does not.\n\nPerhaps the definition of \"surrounded\" is different?\nWhat if it means that *none* of the 8 neighbors (including diagonals) of the 3x3 block belong to *another* 3x3 non-white block? This seems too complex.\n\nLet's reconsider the first hypothesis, but refine the selection rule.\n**Hypothesis 2:**\n1. Find all 3x3 subgrids composed *entirely* of non-background (non-white) colors.\n2. From these candidates, select the one that is \"isolated\" by a border of background color (White=0) or grid boundaries.\n3. If there is exactly one such isolated block, return it. (This matches Ex 1, 3, 4).\n4. What about Example 2? The expected output block is *not* isolated according to this rule. However, the *other* candidate blocks in Ex 2 are also not isolated:\n    * Ex 2 Block (0, 1): Border contains `input[3,1]=0`, `input[0,4]=0`, `input[3,4]=0`. OK. But `input[1, 0] = 0`, `input[2, 0] = 0`. Wait, `input[0,0]=0`. `input[-1, *]` Off-grid. `input[*, 0]` contains `0`s. `input[*, 4]` contains `0`s. `input[3, *]` contains `0`s. It seems the block at (0,1) IS isolated.\n    * Ex 2 Block (1, 5): Border contains `input[0,4]=0`, `input[4,4]=0`, etc. OK. But `input[2, 8] = 8`. Not isolated.\n    * Ex 2 Block (6, 6): Border contains `input[5,5]=0`, etc. OK. But `input[6,5]=0`, `input[7,5]=0`, `input[8,5]=0`. `input[5, *]`=0. `input[9,*]`=Off-grid. `input[*,5]`=0. `input[*,9]`=Off-grid. It seems the block at (6,6) IS isolated.\n\nSo, in Example 2:\n* Block (0, 1) is non-white 3x3 and IS isolated.\n* Block (1, 5) is non-white 3x3 and is NOT isolated.\n* Block (4, 2) (Expected Output) is non-white 3x3 and is NOT isolated.\n* Block (6, 6) is non-white 3x3 and IS isolated.\n\nThis means the rule \"find the unique isolated non-white 3x3 block\" doesn't work for Example 2, as there are two isolated blocks ((0,1) and (6,6)), neither of which is the expected output.\n\nLet's rethink the initial observation that failed the code. The code found the block at (0,4) in Ex 1, while the correct one was (4,6). Both met the criteria (non-white, isolated). The code finds the first one in top-down, left-right order. The correct one was later in that order.\n\nMaybe the rule involves finding *all* blocks meeting *some* criteria, and then selecting one based on position?\n\nWhat if the criteria are *just* \"3x3 block containing only non-white pixels\"?\n*   Ex 1: Candidates at (0, 4), (1, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0). Expected is (4, 6).\n*   Ex 2: Candidates at (0, 1), (1, 5), (4, 2), (6, 6). Expected is (4, 2).\n*   Ex 3: Candidates at (0, 2), (1, 6), (4, 0), (5, 4). Expected is (1, 6).\n*   Ex 4: Candidates at (0, 0), (1, 4), (4, 1), (5, 6). Expected is (5, 6).\n\nIs there a consistent positional selection rule among these candidates?\n*   Ex 1: (4, 6) is neither first nor last in scan order (0,4 -> 1,0 -> 4,6 -> 5,0). It's the 3rd one found.\n*   Ex 2: (4, 2) is neither first nor last (0,1 -> 1,5 -> 4,2 -> 6,6). It's the 3rd one found.\n*   Ex 3: (1, 6) is neither first nor last (0,2 -> 1,6 -> 4,0 -> 5,4). It's the 2nd one found.\n*   Ex 4: (5, 6) is the last one (0,0 -> 1,4 -> 4,1 -> 5,6). It's the 4th one found.\n\nThis doesn't seem like a consistent selection rule based *only* on position among the \"all non-white 3x3\" candidates.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"isolated\" property again. Maybe my check was wrong.\nUse the `check_border` function from the original code.\n\nLet's re-run the check for isolation for all candidate blocks:\n"

Specific count?\n*   Ex 1: Expected has max blue (5).\n*   Ex 2: Expected has max blue (4).\n*   Ex 3: Expected has max blue (6).\n*   Ex 4: Expected has max blue (5).\n\n**Hypothesis 3:**\n1. Find all 3x3 subgrids in the input that contain *only* non-white pixels (Blue=1 or Azure=8).\n2. For each candidate subgrid, count the number of blue (1) pixels.\n3. Select the candidate subgrid that has the *maximum* number of blue pixels.\n4. If there is a tie for the maximum number of blue pixels, apply a tie-breaking rule. What rule? Let's recheck counts:\n    *   Ex 1: Blues = [1, 0, 5, 3]. Max is 5. Unique. -> Selects (4, 6). Correct.\n    *   Ex 2: Blues = [2, 3, 4, 1]. Max is 4. Unique. -> Selects (4, 2). Correct.\n    *   Ex 3: Blues = [5, 6, 2, 3]. Max is 6. Unique. -> Selects (1, 6). Correct.\n    *   Ex 4: Blues = [1, 3, 2, 5]. Max is 5. Unique. -> Selects (5, 6). Correct.\n\nThis hypothesis works for all four examples *without needing a tie-breaker* in these cases. This seems much more promising. It ignores the isolation property entirely and focuses only on finding the 3x3 non-white block with the most blue pixels.\n\n**Final Check:**\n*   Does the rule make sense? It selects a specific type of pattern (3x3 non-white) based on an internal property (maximising blue pixels). This feels like a plausible ARC rule.\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed because the initial hypothesis about identifying a *unique* 3x3 block surrounded by background color was incorrect. Analysis revealed multiple candidate blocks in most examples, and the target block in Example 2 was *not* surrounded by background color. The key was to re-evaluate the criteria for selecting the correct block among all possible 3x3 blocks composed solely of non-background colors (Blue and Azure).\n\nThe strategy involved:\n1.  Identifying *all* 3x3 subgrids containing only non-background colors.\n2.  Analyzing properties of these candidate blocks (location, isolation status, internal color counts).\n3.  Testing hypotheses about selection rules (positional, isolation, color counts).\n4.  The hypothesis that the correct block is the one with the *maximum number of blue (1) pixels* successfully identified the expected output block in all training examples.\n\n## Metrics\n\n"
