task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: True # Input and output grids have the same height and width
  - background_color: 0 # White
objects:
  - type: marker
    definition: Any non-white pixel (value 1-9) in the input grid.
    properties:
      - position: (row, column)
      - color: The specific value (1-9) of the pixel. # Note: Color seems irrelevant to the rule, only position matters.
relationship:
  - type: horizontal_adjacency
    between: marker, marker
    on: same_row
    condition: Two markers exist on the same row.
action:
  - type: fill_horizontal_gap
    actor: implicit rule
    target: white pixels (0)
    condition: Target pixels are located on the same row and strictly between the columns of two horizontally adjacent markers.
    effect: Change target pixel value to 2 (red).
    constraints:
      - The markers themselves are not changed.
      - Filling occurs between every adjacent pair of markers on a row if more than two exist.
      - No filling occurs if a row has fewer than two markers.
output_color: 2 # Red - The color used for filling.
