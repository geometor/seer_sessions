Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid. Both grids have the same dimensions.
2.  **Pixels:** The grids contain pixels represented by integers 0-9, corresponding to colors. The white color (0) seems to be the background.
3.  **Markers:** Non-white pixels (values 1-9) appear in various patterns in the input grids. Let's call these "markers". The specific color of the marker varies between examples (azure, yellow, blue, green).
4.  **Transformation:** The output grids are largely identical to the input grids, except that some white pixels (0) in the input have been changed to red pixels (2) in the output.
5.  **Location of Changes:** The red pixels appear exclusively *between* pairs of markers located on the *same row*. They fill the horizontal space separating these markers.
6.  **Consistency:** The fill color is consistently red (2), regardless of the color of the markers on that row. The original markers remain unchanged in the output.
7.  **Row-by-Row Logic:** The transformation seems to operate independently on each row. The presence or absence of markers in one row does not affect the changes in another row.
8.  **Multiple Markers:** If a row contains more than two markers, red pixels fill the gaps between each adjacent pair of markers on that row.
9.  **No Change Condition:** If a row contains zero or only one marker, no changes occur on that row.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: True # Input and output grids have the same height and width
  - background_color: 0 # White
objects:
  - type: marker
    definition: Any non-white pixel (value 1-9) in the input grid.
    properties:
      - position: (row, column)
      - color: The specific value (1-9) of the pixel. # Note: Color seems irrelevant to the rule, only position matters.
relationship:
  - type: horizontal_adjacency
    between: marker, marker
    on: same_row
    condition: Two markers exist on the same row.
action:
  - type: fill_horizontal_gap
    actor: implicit rule
    target: white pixels (0)
    condition: Target pixels are located on the same row and strictly between the columns of two horizontally adjacent markers.
    effect: Change target pixel value to 2 (red).
    constraints:
      - The markers themselves are not changed.
      - Filling occurs between every adjacent pair of markers on a row if more than two exist.
      - No filling occurs if a row has fewer than two markers.
output_color: 2 # Red - The color used for filling.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3.  For the current row, identify the column indices of all non-white pixels (markers).
4.  If fewer than two markers are found in the current row, proceed to the next row without making changes.
5.  If two or more markers are found, sort their column indices in ascending order.
6.  Iterate through the sorted list of marker column indices, considering adjacent pairs (index `i` and index `i+1`).
7.  For each adjacent pair of marker column indices (`col1`, `col2`):
    *   Iterate through all column indices `c` such that `col1 < c < col2`.
    *   For each such column index `c`, change the pixel at the current row and column `c` in the *output grid* to red (2).
8.  After processing all rows, return the modified output grid.
