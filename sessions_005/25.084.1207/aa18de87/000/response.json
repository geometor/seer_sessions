            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid. Both grids have the same dimensions.\n2.  **Pixels:** The grids contain pixels represented by integers 0-9, corresponding to colors. The white color (0) seems to be the background.\n3.  **Markers:** Non-white pixels (values 1-9) appear in various patterns in the input grids. Let's call these \"markers\". The specific color of the marker varies between examples (azure, yellow, blue, green).\n4.  **Transformation:** The output grids are largely identical to the input grids, except that some white pixels (0) in the input have been changed to red pixels (2) in the output.\n5.  **Location of Changes:** The red pixels appear exclusively *between* pairs of markers located on the *same row*. They fill the horizontal space separating these markers.\n6.  **Consistency:** The fill color is consistently red (2), regardless of the color of the markers on that row. The original markers remain unchanged in the output.\n7.  **Row-by-Row Logic:** The transformation seems to operate independently on each row. The presence or absence of markers in one row does not affect the changes in another row.\n8.  **Multiple Markers:** If a row contains more than two markers, red pixels fill the gaps between each adjacent pair of markers on that row.\n9.  **No Change Condition:** If a row contains zero or only one marker, no changes occur on that row.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
