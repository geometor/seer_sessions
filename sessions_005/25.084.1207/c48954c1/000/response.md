*   **Perception:**
    *   The task transforms a small 3x3 input grid into a larger 9x9 output grid.
    *   The output grid appears to be composed of nine 3x3 subgrids arranged in a 3x3 pattern.
    *   Comparing the input grid to the subgrids in the output reveals a pattern of transformations and tiling.
    *   The central 3x3 subgrid of the output is identical to the 3x3 input grid.
    *   The other eight subgrids are reflections (or rotations) of the input grid.
    *   Specifically, the subgrids seem related by vertical reflection, horizontal reflection, and combined vertical/horizontal reflection (180-degree rotation).
    *   The arrangement of these transformed subgrids forms a specific, repeating pattern within the 9x9 output.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    input_properties:
      - shape: 3x3 grid
      - content: integer pixel values (0-9) representing colors
    output_properties:
      - shape: 9x9 grid
      - content: integer pixel values (0-9) representing colors
    transformation:
      type: tiling_with_reflection
      details:
        - The output grid is 3 times the height and 3 times the width of the input grid.
        - The output grid can be viewed as a 3x3 arrangement of smaller 3x3 grids (subgrids).
        - Each subgrid is derived from the original 3x3 input grid through a specific transformation.
    transformations_applied:
      - identity: The input grid is used directly.
      - vertical_reflection: The input grid is flipped top-to-bottom.
      - horizontal_reflection: The input grid is flipped left-to-right.
      - combined_reflection: The input grid is flipped both vertically and horizontally (equivalent to 180-degree rotation).
    tiling_pattern:
      # Describes the transformation applied to the input grid
      # to create the subgrid at each position in the 3x3 arrangement.
      - row: 0 # Top row
        columns:
          - 0: combined_reflection # Top-Left
          - 1: vertical_reflection # Top-Mid
          - 2: combined_reflection # Top-Right
      - row: 1 # Middle row
        columns:
          - 0: horizontal_reflection # Mid-Left
          - 1: identity              # Mid-Center
          - 2: horizontal_reflection # Mid-Right
      - row: 2 # Bottom row
        columns:
          - 0: combined_reflection # Bottom-Left
          - 1: vertical_reflection # Bottom-Mid
          - 2: combined_reflection # Bottom-Right

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Define the 3x3 input grid as the "original grid".
    2.  Create three transformed versions of the original grid:
        a.  "Vertically Flipped": Flip the original grid top-to-bottom.
        b.  "Horizontally Flipped": Flip the original grid left-to-right.
        c.  "Combined Flip": Flip the original grid both top-to-bottom and left-to-right.
    3.  Initialize an empty 9x9 output grid.
    4.  Assemble the output grid by placing the original grid and its transformed versions into nine 3x3 subgrid positions as follows:
        *   Top-Left: Combined Flip
        *   Top-Middle: Vertically Flipped
        *   Top-Right: Combined Flip
        *   Middle-Left: Horizontally Flipped
        *   Middle-Center: Original Grid
        *   Middle-Right: Horizontally Flipped
        *   Bottom-Left: Combined Flip
        *   Bottom-Middle: Vertically Flipped
        *   Bottom-Right: Combined Flip
    5.  The assembled 9x9 grid is the final output.
