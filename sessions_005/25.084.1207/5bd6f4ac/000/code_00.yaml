task_description: Extract a subgrid from the input grid.
grid_properties:
  input_size: 9x9
  output_size: 3x3
transformation:
  type: extraction
  source_region:
    type: subgrid
    size: 3x3
    location: top-right corner of the input grid
    coordinates:
      rows: 0 through 2 (inclusive)
      columns: 6 through 8 (inclusive)
  pixel_mapping: direct copy (identity)
rule_determination:
  method: observation of constant location across examples
  invariant: The output is always the 3x3 subgrid at input rows 0-2 and columns 6-8.
