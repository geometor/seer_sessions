Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids are consistently 9 rows by 10 columns. They feature a distinct structure with a column of zeros (white pixels) at index 3 and another at index 6, and a row of zeros at index 4. These zero lines effectively divide the grid into six rectangular regions (2 rows x 3 columns of regions).
2.  **Content within Regions:** Each of these six regions contains a collection of non-zero colored pixels, often forming 2x2 or slightly larger blocks, but the rule applies to all non-zero pixels within the region's boundaries.
3.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are consistently 4 rows by 5 columns. They consist primarily of zeros (white borders), with a 2x3 block of potentially non-zero pixels located at rows 1-2 and columns 1-3.
4.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation involves summarizing each of the six input regions into a single pixel in the output grid. The color of the output pixel is determined by the *most frequent* non-zero color found within the corresponding input region.
5.  **Mapping:** The mapping from input region to output pixel position is positional:
    *   Top-Left input region -> Output pixel at (1, 1)
    *   Top-Middle input region -> Output pixel at (1, 2)
    *   Top-Right input region -> Output pixel at (1, 3)
    *   Bottom-Left input region -> Output pixel at (2, 1)
    *   Bottom-Middle input region -> Output pixel at (2, 2)
    *   Bottom-Right input region -> Output pixel at (2, 3)
6.  **Tie-breaking:** In the provided examples, there are no instances where two different non-zero colors have the exact same maximum frequency within a region. Therefore, a specific tie-breaking rule isn't explicitly demonstrated, but the logic relies solely on identifying the unique most frequent color. If a region only contains zeros, the corresponding output pixel remains zero.

## Facts


```yaml
Input Grid:
  - Property: Dimensions
    Value: 9x10
  - Property: Structure
    Value: Divided into 6 regions by zero columns (index 3, 6) and a zero row (index 4).
  - Object: Regions
    - Name: Top-Left (TL)
      Location: Rows 0-3, Columns 0-2
    - Name: Top-Middle (TM)
      Location: Rows 0-3, Columns 4-5
    - Name: Top-Right (TR)
      Location: Rows 0-3, Columns 7-9
    - Name: Bottom-Left (BL)
      Location: Rows 5-8, Columns 0-2
    - Name: Bottom-Middle (BM)
      Location: Rows 5-8, Columns 4-5
    - Name: Bottom-Right (BR)
      Location: Rows 5-8, Columns 7-9
    - Property: Content
      Value: Each region contains a set of non-zero colored pixels.

Output Grid:
  - Property: Dimensions
    Value: 4x5 (Examples show 5x5, assuming a typo in my observation or the problem description's output dimensions differ slightly from the examples. The core logic maps to a 2x3 area within). Let's correct to 5x5 based on examples.
  - Property: Structure
    Value: Primarily zeros, with a 2x3 central area for output colors.
  - Object: Output Pixels (within the 2x3 central area)
    - Location: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)

Transformation:
  - Action: Summarize each input region.
  - Rule: Find the most frequent non-zero color within the pixels of the region.
  - Relationship: Mapping from Input Region to Output Pixel:
    - TL -> (1,1)
    - TM -> (1,2)
    - TR -> (1,3)
    - BL -> (2,1)
    - BM -> (2,2)
    - BR -> (2,3)
  - Constraint: If a region contains no non-zero pixels, the output pixel is zero.
  - Constraint: Tie-breaking for frequency is not required based on examples.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize a new output grid of size 5x5 with all pixels set to zero (white).
2.  Define the six regions in the input grid based on the separating zero column (index 3), zero column (index 6), and zero row (index 4):
    *   Region TL: Rows 0-3, Columns 0-2
    *   Region TM: Rows 0-3, Columns 4-5
    *   Region TR: Rows 0-3, Columns 7-9
    *   Region BL: Rows 5-8, Columns 0-2
    *   Region BM: Rows 5-8, Columns 4-5
    *   Region BR: Rows 5-8, Columns 7-9
3.  For each of the six regions:
    a.  Collect all non-zero pixel values (colors) present within that region's boundaries.
    b.  If no non-zero pixels are found, skip to the next region (the corresponding output pixel remains zero).
    c.  Count the frequency of each unique non-zero color found in the region.
    d.  Identify the color with the highest frequency count. (Assume there will be a unique maximum frequency based on examples).
    e.  Determine the target output grid coordinates based on the region:
        *   TL -> (1, 1)
        *   TM -> (1, 2)
        *   TR -> (1, 3)
        *   BL -> (2, 1)
        *   BM -> (2, 2)
        *   BR -> (2, 3)
    f.  Set the pixel at the determined target coordinates in the output grid to the most frequent color identified in step 3d.
4.  Return the completed 5x5 output grid.
