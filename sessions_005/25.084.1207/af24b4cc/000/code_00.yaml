Input Grid:
  - Property: Dimensions
    Value: 9x10
  - Property: Structure
    Value: Divided into 6 regions by zero columns (index 3, 6) and a zero row (index 4).
  - Object: Regions
    - Name: Top-Left (TL)
      Location: Rows 0-3, Columns 0-2
    - Name: Top-Middle (TM)
      Location: Rows 0-3, Columns 4-5
    - Name: Top-Right (TR)
      Location: Rows 0-3, Columns 7-9
    - Name: Bottom-Left (BL)
      Location: Rows 5-8, Columns 0-2
    - Name: Bottom-Middle (BM)
      Location: Rows 5-8, Columns 4-5
    - Name: Bottom-Right (BR)
      Location: Rows 5-8, Columns 7-9
    - Property: Content
      Value: Each region contains a set of non-zero colored pixels.

Output Grid:
  - Property: Dimensions
    Value: 4x5 (Examples show 5x5, assuming a typo in my observation or the problem description's output dimensions differ slightly from the examples. The core logic maps to a 2x3 area within). Let's correct to 5x5 based on examples.
  - Property: Structure
    Value: Primarily zeros, with a 2x3 central area for output colors.
  - Object: Output Pixels (within the 2x3 central area)
    - Location: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)

Transformation:
  - Action: Summarize each input region.
  - Rule: Find the most frequent non-zero color within the pixels of the region.
  - Relationship: Mapping from Input Region to Output Pixel:
    - TL -> (1,1)
    - TM -> (1,2)
    - TR -> (1,3)
    - BL -> (2,1)
    - BM -> (2,2)
    - BR -> (2,3)
  - Constraint: If a region contains no non-zero pixels, the output pixel is zero.
  - Constraint: Tie-breaking for frequency is not required based on examples.
