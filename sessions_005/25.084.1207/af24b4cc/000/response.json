            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids are consistently 9 rows by 10 columns. They feature a distinct structure with a column of zeros (white pixels) at index 3 and another at index 6, and a row of zeros at index 4. These zero lines effectively divide the grid into six rectangular regions (2 rows x 3 columns of regions).\n2.  **Content within Regions:** Each of these six regions contains a collection of non-zero colored pixels, often forming 2x2 or slightly larger blocks, but the rule applies to all non-zero pixels within the region's boundaries.\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are consistently 4 rows by 5 columns. They consist primarily of zeros (white borders), with a 2x3 block of potentially non-zero pixels located at rows 1-2 and columns 1-3.\n4.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation involves summarizing each of the six input regions into a single pixel in the output grid. The color of the output pixel is determined by the *most frequent* non-zero color found within the corresponding input region.\n5.  **Mapping:** The mapping from input region to output pixel position is positional:\n    *   Top-Left input region -> Output pixel at (1, 1)\n    *   Top-Middle input region -> Output pixel at (1, 2)\n    *   Top-Right input region -> Output pixel at (1, 3)\n    *   Bottom-Left input region -> Output pixel at (2, 1)\n    *   Bottom-Middle input region -> Output pixel at (2, 2)\n    *   Bottom-Right input region -> Output pixel at (2, 3)\n6.  **Tie-breaking:** In the provided examples, there are no instances where two different non-zero colors have the exact same maximum frequency within a region. Therefore, a specific tie-breaking rule isn't explicitly demonstrated, but the logic relies solely on identifying the unique most frequent color. If a region only contains zeros, the corresponding output pixel remains zero.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
