Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples feature grids divided into distinct regions by lines of yellow (4) pixels. These yellow lines act as separators and are invariant between the input and output.
2.  **Regions:** The yellow separators partition the grid into smaller rectangular areas. In `train_1`, the partitioning creates 6 regions (3 rows x 3 columns). In `train_2`, it also creates 6 regions (3 rows x 3 columns).
3.  **Region Pairing:** There appears to be a pairing mechanism between regions across a central separator line.
    *   In `train_1`, regions are paired horizontally across the central vertical yellow line. The left regions seem to influence the right regions.
    *   In `train_2`, regions are paired vertically across the central horizontal yellow line. The top regions seem to influence the bottom regions.
4.  **Source Color:** In one region of each pair (the 'source' region), there is typically a single pixel of a distinct color (not white/0 or yellow/4). Examples include orange (7), green (3), azure (8), red (2), magenta (6). These source regions remain unchanged in the output.
5.  **Target Pixels:** In the corresponding 'target' region of the pair, there are pixels colored blue (1). The pattern of these blue pixels varies.
6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the replacement of the blue (1) pixels in the 'target' region. They are replaced with the specific color found in the corresponding 'source' region. The spatial pattern of the original blue pixels is preserved, but their color changes.
7.  **Invariance:** White (0) pixels, yellow (4) separator pixels, and all pixels within the 'source' regions remain unchanged.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensions: Variable (e.g., 11x7, 7x11).
  colors_present: white(0), blue(1), yellow(4), and various others (e.g., orange(7), green(3), azure(8), red(2), magenta(6)).

components:
  - type: separator
    color: yellow(4)
    description: Forms horizontal and/or vertical lines that partition the grid.
    invariance: Separator pixels remain unchanged in the output.
  - type: region
    description: Contiguous areas of the grid bounded by separators or grid edges.
  - type: region_pair
    description: Regions are paired across a central separator line (horizontally or vertically).
    relationship: One region acts as a 'source', the other as a 'target'.
  - type: source_region
    properties: Contains a unique non-white, non-yellow color (source_color).
    invariance: Remains unchanged in the output.
  - type: target_region
    properties: Contains blue(1) pixels. May also contain white(0) pixels.
    transformation: Blue(1) pixels are modified.
  - type: source_color
    description: The distinct color found within the source_region (e.g., orange, green, azure, red, magenta).
  - type: target_pixel
    color: blue(1)
    location: Within a target_region.

transformation:
  action: color_replacement
  input_pixels: Blue(1) pixels within a target_region.
  output_pixels: Pixels at the same location as input_pixels, but colored with the source_color from the corresponding source_region.
  condition: The replacement occurs only for blue(1) pixels in target regions. All other pixels retain their original color.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Separators:** Locate all pixels with the color yellow (4). These form the static structure dividing the grid.
2.  **Identify Regions:** Determine the distinct, contiguous regions bounded by the yellow separators and the grid borders.
3.  **Identify Region Pairs:** Find pairs of regions that are adjacent across a central yellow separator line (either horizontal or vertical). Designate one region in the pair as the 'source' and the other as the 'target'. The source region typically contains a unique color, while the target region contains blue (1). *Correction: Designation depends on the pattern axis - for vertical separators, left is source, right is target; for horizontal separators, top is source, bottom is target.*
4.  **For each Region Pair:**
    a.  **Find Source Color:** Identify the single, unique color within the source region that is not white (0) or yellow (4). Store this color.
    b.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Locate all pixels within the target region that have the color blue (1).
    c.  **Replace Target Pixels:** For each identified blue (1) pixel in the target region, change its color to the source color found in step 4a.
5.  **Output:** The final grid consists of the original grid with the modifications from step 4c applied. All pixels not explicitly changed (separators, source regions, white pixels in target regions) retain their original colors.
