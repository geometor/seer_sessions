task_context:
  grid_dimensions: Variable (e.g., 11x7, 7x11).
  colors_present: white(0), blue(1), yellow(4), and various others (e.g., orange(7), green(3), azure(8), red(2), magenta(6)).

components:
  - type: separator
    color: yellow(4)
    description: Forms horizontal and/or vertical lines that partition the grid.
    invariance: Separator pixels remain unchanged in the output.
  - type: region
    description: Contiguous areas of the grid bounded by separators or grid edges.
  - type: region_pair
    description: Regions are paired across a central separator line (horizontally or vertically).
    relationship: One region acts as a 'source', the other as a 'target'.
  - type: source_region
    properties: Contains a unique non-white, non-yellow color (source_color).
    invariance: Remains unchanged in the output.
  - type: target_region
    properties: Contains blue(1) pixels. May also contain white(0) pixels.
    transformation: Blue(1) pixels are modified.
  - type: source_color
    description: The distinct color found within the source_region (e.g., orange, green, azure, red, magenta).
  - type: target_pixel
    color: blue(1)
    location: Within a target_region.

transformation:
  action: color_replacement
  input_pixels: Blue(1) pixels within a target_region.
  output_pixels: Pixels at the same location as input_pixels, but colored with the source_color from the corresponding source_region.
  condition: The replacement occurs only for blue(1) pixels in target regions. All other pixels retain their original color.
