Task: Swap colors of nested layers cyclically.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels.
  - Objects:
      - Type: Nested_Layers
      - Description: Contiguous regions of uniform color, typically rectangular or frame-like, nested within each other. Identified by scanning inwards from the boundary.
      - Properties:
          - Color: The single color filling the layer.
          - Order: Position in the nesting sequence (0 for outermost, 1 for next, etc.).
  - Relationships:
      - Adjacency: Layers are adjacent to each other.
      - Nesting: Layers enclose subsequent layers.

Transformation:
  - Action: Color_Permutation
  - Rule: The set of distinct colors, ordered by their layer's appearance from outside-in, undergoes a cyclic shift.
  - Mapping:
      - Identify distinct colors in order of appearance from outside-in: `C_in = [c1, c2, ..., cn]`.
      - Create the shifted list: `C_out = [cn, c1, c2, ..., c(n-1)]`.
      - Apply mapping: Replace every pixel with color `ci` in the input grid with the color `C_out[i]` (where `i` is the index in `C_in`).

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions and layer structure as the input.
  - Objects: Nested_Layers with permuted colors according to the rule.
