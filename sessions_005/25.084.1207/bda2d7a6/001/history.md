Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are square or rectangular.
2.  **Color Regions:** The grids are composed of distinct regions, each filled with a single solid color.
3.  **Nesting:** These regions appear to be nested within each other, forming layers. Typically, there's an outermost frame or background color, followed by one or more inner rectangular or frame-like regions, potentially ending with a central core region.
4.  **Colors:** A small set of distinct colors is used within each example (typically 3 or 4, though one color might appear in multiple layers like in example 1).
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve changing the colors of these nested layers while preserving the overall geometric structure. The output grid has the same shapes/layers as the input, but the colors assigned to these layers are different.
6.  **Color Swapping Pattern:** Comparing the input and output colors layer by layer (from outside inwards), there's a consistent permutation. In all examples, the color of the outermost layer moves to the second layer, the second layer's color moves to the third, and so on, with the innermost layer's color wrapping around to become the color of the outermost layer in the output. This is equivalent to a cyclic shift of the colors based on their layer order.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
Task: Swap colors of nested layers cyclically.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels.
  - Objects:
      - Type: Nested_Layers
      - Description: Contiguous regions of uniform color, typically rectangular or frame-like, nested within each other. Identified by scanning inwards from the boundary.
      - Properties:
          - Color: The single color filling the layer.
          - Order: Position in the nesting sequence (0 for outermost, 1 for next, etc.).
  - Relationships:
      - Adjacency: Layers are adjacent to each other.
      - Nesting: Layers enclose subsequent layers.

Transformation:
  - Action: Color_Permutation
  - Rule: The set of distinct colors, ordered by their layer's appearance from outside-in, undergoes a cyclic shift.
  - Mapping:
      - Identify distinct colors in order of appearance from outside-in: `C_in = [c1, c2, ..., cn]`.
      - Create the shifted list: `C_out = [cn, c1, c2, ..., c(n-1)]`.
      - Apply mapping: Replace every pixel with color `ci` in the input grid with the color `C_out[i]` (where `i` is the index in `C_in`).

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions and layer structure as the input.
  - Objects: Nested_Layers with permuted colors according to the rule.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input grid to identify the distinct colors present.
2.  Determine the order of these distinct colors based on the nesting of the layers they form. Start from a corner pixel (e.g., top-left) to find the first color (outermost layer). Then, find the color of a pixel adjacent to the first layer's pixels but having a different color; this is the second color. Continue this process iteratively, finding the color adjacent to the previously found layer that hasn't been seen yet, until all distinct colors are ordered according to their layer position from outside inwards. Let this ordered list be `Input_Colors`.
3.  Create a `Color_Map` for the transformation. For each color `C` at index `i` in the `Input_Colors` list, map it to the color at index `(i - 1 + N) % N` in the `Input_Colors` list, where `N` is the total number of distinct colors (this performs a cyclic shift where the first color maps to the last, the second maps to the first, and so on).
4.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.
5.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. For each pixel, find its color in the `Color_Map` and place the corresponding mapped color into the same position in the output grid.
6.  Return the completed output grid.
