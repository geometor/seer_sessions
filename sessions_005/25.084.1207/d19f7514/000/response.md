Okay, I will analyze the provided task examples and derive the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Size:** All training examples have an input grid of 12 rows by 4 columns and an output grid of 6 rows by 4 columns. The output grid height is exactly half the input grid height.
2.  **Colors:**
    *   Input grids primarily use white (0), green (3), and gray (5).
    *   Output grids primarily use white (0) and yellow (4).
3.  **Structure:** The input grid appears vertically divided into two distinct 6x4 sections.
    *   The top section (rows 0-5) contains white (0) and green (3) pixels.
    *   The bottom section (rows 6-11) contains white (0) and gray (5) pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to overlay or combine information from the top and bottom sections of the input grid to produce the output grid. Each output pixel corresponds spatially to a pixel in the top input section and a pixel in the bottom input section.

**YAML Facts:**

    - type: Grid Split
      description: Input grid is vertically split into two equal halves.
      properties:
        top_half_rows: [0, 5]
        bottom_half_rows: [6, 11]
        top_half_colors: [white (0), green (3)]
        bottom_half_colors: [white (0), gray (5)]
        output_grid_size: Matches half grid size (6x4)

transformation_elements:
  - element: Pixel Combination
    description: Combines corresponding pixels from the top and bottom input halves.
    relationship: One-to-one mapping between output pixel (r, c) and input pixels (r, c) from top half and (r + input_height/2, c) from bottom half.
    rule:
      condition: Pixel in top half is green (3) OR corresponding pixel in bottom half is gray (5).
      action: Set corresponding output pixel to yellow (4).
    rule_else:
      condition: Both corresponding input pixels (top and bottom) are white (0).
      action: Set corresponding output pixel to white (0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Divide the input grid vertically into two equal halves: a `top_grid` (rows 0 to 5) and a `bottom_grid` (rows 6 to 11).
2.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the `top_grid` (6 rows, 4 columns), initially filled with white (0).
3.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) position `(row, column)` from `(0, 0)` to `(5, 3)`.
4.  For the current position `(row, column)`:
    a.  Check the color of the pixel at `(row, column)` in the `top_grid`.
    b.  Check the color of the pixel at `(row, column)` in the `bottom_grid`.
    c.  If the pixel in the `top_grid` is green (3) OR the pixel in the `bottom_grid` is gray (5), set the pixel at `(row, column)` in the output grid to yellow (4).
    d.  Otherwise (if both corresponding input pixels are white), the output pixel remains white (0).
5.  Return the completed output grid.
