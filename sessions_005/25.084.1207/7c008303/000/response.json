            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the task examples and provide the requested deliverables.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Each input grid contains a single solid horizontal line and a single solid vertical line of azure (8) pixels. These lines intersect and divide the grid into four main quadrants, although the lines themselves are the key structural elements.\n2.  **Key Regions:** Two distinct regions appear important, located relative to the intersection of the azure lines:\n    *   A 6x6 region composed primarily of green (3) and white (0) pixels. This region acts as a template or pattern.\n    *   A 2x2 region containing four distinct colors (other than azure and white). This region acts as a color key.\n3.  **Relative Positioning:** The 6x6 pattern region and the 2x2 color key region are located in diagonally opposite quadrants relative to the azure line intersection. For instance, if the pattern is below the horizontal line and left of the vertical line, the key is above the horizontal line and right of the vertical line.\n4.  **Output Generation:** The output is always a 6x6 grid. It appears to be generated by taking the 6x6 green/white pattern region from the input and \"coloring\" the green pixels based on the 2x2 color key.\n5.  **Color Mapping Logic:** The 6x6 pattern grid and the output grid are conceptually divided into four 3x3 quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right). Each cell in the 2x2 color key corresponds to one of these quadrants. When generating the output, if a pixel in a specific 3x3 quadrant of the pattern grid is green (3), its color in the corresponding output quadrant is changed to the color specified by the associated cell in the 2x2 color key. White (0) pixels from the pattern grid remain white (0) in the output.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
