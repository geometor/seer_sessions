Okay, I will analyze the task examples and provide the requested deliverables.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Each input grid contains a single solid horizontal line and a single solid vertical line of azure (8) pixels. These lines intersect and divide the grid into four main quadrants, although the lines themselves are the key structural elements.
2.  **Key Regions:** Two distinct regions appear important, located relative to the intersection of the azure lines:
    *   A 6x6 region composed primarily of green (3) and white (0) pixels. This region acts as a template or pattern.
    *   A 2x2 region containing four distinct colors (other than azure and white). This region acts as a color key.
3.  **Relative Positioning:** The 6x6 pattern region and the 2x2 color key region are located in diagonally opposite quadrants relative to the azure line intersection. For instance, if the pattern is below the horizontal line and left of the vertical line, the key is above the horizontal line and right of the vertical line.
4.  **Output Generation:** The output is always a 6x6 grid. It appears to be generated by taking the 6x6 green/white pattern region from the input and "coloring" the green pixels based on the 2x2 color key.
5.  **Color Mapping Logic:** The 6x6 pattern grid and the output grid are conceptually divided into four 3x3 quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right). Each cell in the 2x2 color key corresponds to one of these quadrants. When generating the output, if a pixel in a specific 3x3 quadrant of the pattern grid is green (3), its color in the corresponding output quadrant is changed to the color specified by the associated cell in the 2x2 color key. White (0) pixels from the pattern grid remain white (0) in the output.

      Determine the coordinates of the 6x6 pattern_grid and the 2x2 color_key_grid
      based on their positions relative to the intersection of the azure lines.
      The pattern grid contains green and white pixels. The color key grid contains
      four other colors. They are in diagonally opposite quadrants relative to the
      azure line intersection.

      Create a new 6x6 output grid. Divide the output grid and the pattern_grid
      into four 3x3 quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).
      Map each cell of the 2x2 color_key_grid to a corresponding quadrant:
      - color_key_grid[0, 0] -> top-left quadrant
      - color_key_grid[0, 1] -> top-right quadrant
      - color_key_grid[1, 0] -> bottom-left quadrant
      - color_key_grid[1, 1] -> bottom-right quadrant
      Iterate through each cell (r, c) in the 6x6 pattern_grid. Determine which
      3x3 quadrant it belongs to. Get the corresponding key_color from the
      color_key_grid. If pattern_grid[r, c] is green (3), set output_grid[r, c]
      to key_color. If pattern_grid[r, c] is white (0), set output_grid[r, c]
      to white (0).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Separators:** Scan the input grid to find the unique row index (`hr`) containing only azure (8) pixels (the horizontal line) and the unique column index (`vc`) containing only azure (8) pixels (the vertical line).
2.  **Locate Pattern Grid:** Determine the location of the 6x6 subgrid composed mainly of green (3) and white (0) pixels. This grid will be located adjacent to the intersection point (`hr`, `vc`), either above or below `hr` and either left or right of `vc`. Extract this 6x6 subgrid as the `pattern_grid`.
3.  **Locate Color Key Grid:** Determine the location of the 2x2 subgrid containing four distinct colors (not azure or white). This grid will also be adjacent to the intersection point (`hr`, `vc`), but in the quadrant diagonally opposite the `pattern_grid`. Extract this 2x2 subgrid as the `color_key_grid`.
4.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new 6x6 grid, filled initially with white (0) pixels. This will be the `output_grid`.
5.  **Apply Coloring:**
    *   Define the mapping between the `color_key_grid` cells and the 3x3 quadrants of the output:
        *   `key_tl` = `color_key_grid[0, 0]` maps to output rows 0-2, columns 0-2.
        *   `key_tr` = `color_key_grid[0, 1]` maps to output rows 0-2, columns 3-5.
        *   `key_bl` = `color_key_grid[1, 0]` maps to output rows 3-5, columns 0-2.
        *   `key_br` = `color_key_grid[1, 1]` maps to output rows 3-5, columns 3-5.
    *   Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` from `(0, 0)` to `(5, 5)` of the `pattern_grid`:
        *   If `pattern_grid[r, c]` is green (3):
            *   If `0 <= r < 3` and `0 <= c < 3` (top-left quadrant), set `output_grid[r, c] = key_tl`.
            *   If `0 <= r < 3` and `3 <= c < 6` (top-right quadrant), set `output_grid[r, c] = key_tr`.
            *   If `3 <= r < 6` and `0 <= c < 3` (bottom-left quadrant), set `output_grid[r, c] = key_bl`.
            *   If `3 <= r < 6` and `3 <= c < 6` (bottom-right quadrant), set `output_grid[r, c] = key_br`.
        *   If `pattern_grid[r, c]` is white (0), leave `output_grid[r, c]` as white (0).
6.  **Return Output:** The final `output_grid` is the result.
