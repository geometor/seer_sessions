            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the failures and refine the understanding of the transformation.\n\n**General Assessment & Strategy**\n\nThe provided code failed on the first two training examples. In both cases, the `Transformed Output` was almost identical to the `Input`, with only the non-blue \"isolated\" pixels (as defined by the code) being removed. The expected outputs, however, show new vertical patterns being drawn in specific columns, extending from the top of the grid down to a certain row.\n\nThe key differences are:\n1.  **Pattern Generation Failure:** The code did not generate the vertical color patterns seen in the expected outputs.\n2.  **Definition of \"Trigger\" Pixels:** The code's logic hinges on finding \"isolated pixels\" (surrounded by background) and then \"active\" ones (non-blue isolated pixels). However, inspecting the input grids reveals that the pixels determining the pattern (Yellow at (11,10) and Red at (12,10) in Ex1; Yellow at (11,8) and Red at (11,9) in Ex2) are *not* isolated by background according to the 8-neighbor definition. They are adjacent to other non-background pixels.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Re-evaluate the definition of the pixels that trigger the pattern generation. The term \"isolated\" seems misleading. Perhaps it refers to \"single-pixel objects\" (objects composed of only one pixel).\n2.  Verify if this new definition (\"single-pixel objects\") aligns with the rest of the observed logic (marker object, adjacency, pattern parameters).\n3.  Use `tool_code` to confirm object properties and relationships in the examples based on the \"single-pixel object\" hypothesis.\n4.  Update the YAML facts and the natural language program based on the revised understanding.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's use code execution to analyze the examples with the \"single-pixel object\" hypothesis.\n\n"

            "text": "**Analysis of Metrics:**\n\nThe code execution results strongly support the \"single-pixel object\" hypothesis:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Single-pixel non-background objects are found, including the critical Yellow(4) at (11, 10) and Red(2) at (12, 10). (Also others at row 5, which weren't considered before).\n    *   The lowest blue object (marker) is correctly identified.\n    *   \"Active\" pixels are all non-blue single-pixel objects.\n    *   Crucially, only the Red(2) at (12, 10) is found to be adjacent (diagonally) to the marker object (specifically to the blue pixel at (13, 10)).\n    *   Pattern Columns: Derived from the single adjacent active pixel -> `[10]`. Correct.\n    *   Pattern Bottom Row: Minimum row of adjacent active pixels -> `12`. Correct.\n    *   Pattern Colors: Derived from *all* active pixels, sorted bottom-up, left-right. The sorting order is: Red(12,10), Yellow(11,10), then the pixels at row 5. The unique colors in this order are Red(2), Yellow(4), Green(3). Wait, the expected pattern is Red, Yellow, Red, Yellow... (`[2, 4]`). The code derived `[2, 4, 3]`. This part of the rule needs refinement. It seems only the colors of the *adjacent* active pixels, or perhaps only the active pixels *below* a certain line, should be considered. Let's re-examine Example 1's input/output. The active pixels at row 5 seem unrelated to the output pattern. Let's refine Step 8: The colors should come from *only those active pixels that are adjacent to the marker*.\n        *   *Refined Pattern Colors (Ex 1):* Only Red(2) at (12, 10) is adjacent. Color sequence: `[2]`. This doesn't match the `[2, 4]` pattern.\n        *   *Alternative Refinement:* What if the colors come from *all* active pixels *below the marker's top-most row*? The marker spans rows 13-15. Active pixels below row 13 are Yellow(11,10) and Red(12,10). Sorted bottom-up, left-right: Red(12,10), Yellow(11,10). Unique colors: `[2, 4]`. **This matches the expected pattern.** Let's test this on Example 2.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Single-pixel non-background objects: Yellow(4) at (11, 8), Red(2) at (11, 9). Correct.\n    *   Marker object is correct.\n    *   Active pixels are Yellow(4)@(11,8) and Red(2)@(11,9). Correct.\n    *   *Both* active pixels are adjacent to the marker. Correct.\n    *   Pattern Columns: Derived from both adjacent active pixels -> `[8, 9]`. Correct.\n    *   Pattern Bottom Row: Minimum row of adjacent active pixels -> `11`. Correct.\n    *   Pattern Colors (Refined Rule): Active pixels below the marker's top row (row 12)? Both Yellow(11,8) and Red(11,9) are below row 12. Sorted bottom-up (same row), left-right: Yellow(11,8), Red(11,9). Unique colors: `[4, 2]`. **This matches the expected pattern.**\n\n**Conclusion from Metrics:** The \"single-pixel object\" definition is correct. The pattern columns and bottom row depend on *adjacency* to the marker. The pattern *colors* depend on *all* active single-pixel objects located *below the highest row* occupied by the marker object, sorted bottom-up, then left-right.\n\n---\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

If no blue objects exist, return the input grid.\n    *   Determine the top-most row index (`marker_top_row`) occupied by the marker object.\n4.  **Find Single-Pixel Objects:** Find all objects in the grid consisting of exactly one pixel, whose color is not the background color.\n5.  **Identify Active Pixels:** Filter the single-pixel objects found in step 4, keeping only those whose color is *not* blue (1). These are the 'active pixels'.\n6.  **Handle No Active Pixels:** If there are no active pixels, return the input grid.\n7.  **Identify Adjacent Active Pixels:** Check each active pixel for adjacency (including diagonals) to *any* pixel belonging to the marker object. Collect the active pixels that are adjacent.\n8.  **Determine Pattern Columns:** Create a sorted list of the unique column indices from the adjacent active pixels found in step 7.\n9.  **Determine Pattern Color Sequence:**\n    *   Filter the active pixels (from step 5) to keep only those whose row index is *greater than* `marker_top_row` (i.e., they are located strictly below the top edge of the marker).\n    *   Sort these filtered active pixels first by row index in descending order (bottom-to-top), and then by column index in ascending order (left-to-right).\n    *   Create the color sequence by taking the colors of these sorted pixels in order. Keep only the *first* occurrence of each unique color encountered.\n10. **Determine Pattern Bottom Row:** Find the minimum row index among the adjacent active pixels found in step 7.\n11. **Draw Pattern (if applicable):**\n    *   If there are adjacent active pixels (step 7) AND the pattern color sequence (step 9) is not empty:\n        *   Iterate through each column index in the `Pattern Columns` (step 8).\n        *   For each column, iterate through rows from 0 down to the `Pattern Bottom Row` (step 10), inclusive.\n        *   Set the pixel color in the `output_grid` at `(row, column)` using the `Pattern Color Sequence`, cycling through the sequence based on the `row` index (`color = sequence[row % len(sequence)]`).\n12. **Cleanup Active Pixels:** Iterate through all active pixels identified in step 5. For each active pixel at `(r, c)`:\n    *   Check if the location `(r, c)` falls within the area where the pattern was drawn (i.e., if `c` is in `Pattern Columns` and `r` is less than or equal to `Pattern Bottom Row`).\n    *   If the location is *not* within the pattern area, set `output_grid[r, c]` to the background color. (If it *is* within the pattern area, it has already been overwritten by the pattern drawing step).\n13. **Return:** Return the modified output grid."
