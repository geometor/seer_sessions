Other blue objects also remain unchanged.\n    *   Some, but not all, of the isolated single pixels disappear in the output (replaced by the background color). Specifically, the non-blue isolated pixels disappear.\n    *   A new vertical repeating pattern appears in the output grid. This pattern's colors are derived from the colors of the isolated pixels that disappeared.\n    *   The location (column(s)) and vertical extent (rows) of the new pattern seem related to the marker object and the locations of the disappeared isolated pixels.\n    *   The pattern overwrites any existing pixels in its path.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "

Find all 'isolated' pixels: single pixels of any non-background color whose 8 neighboring cells are all the background color.\n    4.  Create a set named `active_pixels` containing only those isolated pixels whose color is *not* blue (color 1).\n    5.  If `active_pixels` is empty, return the input grid unchanged.\n    6.  Create a subset named `adjacent_active_pixels` containing pixels from `active_pixels` that are adjacent (including diagonals) to any part of the marker object.\n    7.  Determine the set of columns `pattern_columns` where the pattern will be drawn: These are the unique column indices of the pixels in `adjacent_active_pixels`.\n    8.  Determine the repeating color sequence `pattern_colors`:\n        a.  Collect the unique colors from *all* pixels in `active_pixels`.\n        b.  Order these colors based on the position (scan bottom-to-top, then left-to-right) of the first occurrence of each color within the `active_pixels` set.\n    9.

Set the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid using the `pattern_colors` sequence, repeating as necessary.\n    12. Clean up: In the output grid, change the color of all pixels corresponding to the original locations of the pixels in `active_pixels` to the background color.\n    13.
