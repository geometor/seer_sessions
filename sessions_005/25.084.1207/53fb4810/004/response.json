            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code failed because the logic derived from the first example did not generalize to the second. Specifically:\n\n1.  **Trigger Pixel Identification:** The condition for identifying the pixels that determine the pattern (location and colors) was incorrect. Relying on adjacency (including diagonals) to the marker object failed to identify the correct trigger pixels in both examples.\n2.  **Pattern Parameter Derivation:** Consequently, the pattern columns, bottom row, and color sequence were derived incorrectly or not at all.\n3.  **Cleanup:** The cleanup step incorrectly removed *all* single non-blue pixels that weren't overwritten by the (incorrectly absent) pattern. This removed pixels that should have been preserved (the horizontal line in Ex1, the vertical line in Ex2).\n\nThe strategy is to refine the identification of the \"trigger pixels\" and adjust the derivation of pattern parameters (columns, bottom row, color sequence) and the cleanup process based on these correctly identified trigger pixels. The analysis suggests a connection between the trigger pixels, the marker object's lowest points, and the columns they share.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's re-examine the inputs and expected outputs to confirm the properties.\n\n"
