Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are the same size (7x7 in both examples).
2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved are white (0), azure (8), and blue (1).
3.  **Input Composition:** The input grids consist of a white background with distinct shapes or clusters made of azure pixels.
4.  **Output Composition:** The output grids are nearly identical to the input grids. The azure shapes remain unchanged in position and color. The only difference is that a few specific white pixels in the input have been changed to blue in the output.
5.  **Transformation Locus:** The change from white (0) to blue (1) occurs *adjacent* to the azure (8) shapes. Specifically, it seems to happen horizontally next to vertical segments of the azure shapes.
6.  **Example 1 Analysis:**
    *   The blue pixel at (1, 4) is to the left of the azure pixel at (1, 5). The azure pixel (1, 5) has an azure neighbor above it at (0, 5).
    *   The blue pixel at (2, 3) is to the right of the azure pixel at (2, 2). The azure pixel (2, 2) has an azure neighbor below it at (3, 2).
    *   The blue pixel at (5, 3) is to the left of the azure pixel at (5, 4). The azure pixel (5, 4) has an azure neighbor below it at (6, 4).
7.  **Example 2 Analysis:**
    *   The blue pixel at (1, 2) is to the right of the azure pixel at (1, 1). The azure pixel (1, 1) has an azure neighbor below it at (2, 1).
    *   The blue pixel at (4, 4) is to the left of the azure pixel at (4, 5). The azure pixel (4, 5) has an azure neighbor above it at (3, 5).
8.  **Pattern:** It appears that a white pixel changes to blue if and only if it is horizontally adjacent (left or right) to exactly one azure pixel, and that azure pixel is part of a vertical line segment of azure pixels (i.e., it has another azure pixel directly above or below it).

**Facts**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: Consistent between input and output (e.g., 7x7).
      - background_color: white (0)
  - item: objects
    description: Contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - persistence: Remain unchanged in shape, color, and position in the output.
  - item: transformation
    description: Specific white pixels are conditionally changed to blue.
    conditions:
      - target_pixel_color: white (0)
      - spatial_relationship: Must be horizontally adjacent (left or right) to an azure (8) pixel.
      - neighbor_count: Must have exactly one horizontal azure neighbor.
      - neighbor_context: The adjacent azure (8) pixel must have at least one vertical neighbor (above or below) that is also azure (8).
    action:
      - change_color: from white (0) to blue (1)
  - item: other_pixels
    description: Pixels not meeting the transformation conditions.
    properties:
      - color: Retain their original color from the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new grid identical to the input grid; this will be the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid by its row and column index.
3.  For the current cell at `(row, col)`:
    a.  Check if the color of the cell in the input grid is white (0).
    b.  If it is white, examine its immediate horizontal neighbors: the cell to the left `(row, col-1)` and the cell to the right `(row, col+1)`, considering grid boundaries (ignore neighbors outside the grid).
    c.  Count how many of these existing horizontal neighbors are azure (8).
    d.  If the count is exactly one:
        i.  Identify the location `(neighbor_row, neighbor_col)` of that single azure horizontal neighbor.
        ii. Check if the cell directly above the azure neighbor `(neighbor_row-1, neighbor_col)` or the cell directly below it `(neighbor_row+1, neighbor_col)` exists within the grid boundaries and is also azure (8).
        iii. If at least one of these vertical neighbors (above or below) is azure (8), then change the color of the cell at `(row, col)` in the *output* grid to blue (1).
4.  After checking all cells, return the modified output grid.
