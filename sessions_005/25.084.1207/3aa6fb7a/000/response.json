            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are the same size (7x7 in both examples).\n2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved are white (0), azure (8), and blue (1).\n3.  **Input Composition:** The input grids consist of a white background with distinct shapes or clusters made of azure pixels.\n4.  **Output Composition:** The output grids are nearly identical to the input grids. The azure shapes remain unchanged in position and color. The only difference is that a few specific white pixels in the input have been changed to blue in the output.\n5.  **Transformation Locus:** The change from white (0) to blue (1) occurs *adjacent* to the azure (8) shapes. Specifically, it seems to happen horizontally next to vertical segments of the azure shapes.\n6.  **Example 1 Analysis:**\n    *   The blue pixel at (1, 4) is to the left of the azure pixel at (1, 5). The azure pixel (1, 5) has an azure neighbor above it at (0, 5).\n    *   The blue pixel at (2, 3) is to the right of the azure pixel at (2, 2). The azure pixel (2, 2) has an azure neighbor below it at (3, 2).\n    *   The blue pixel at (5, 3) is to the left of the azure pixel at (5, 4). The azure pixel (5, 4) has an azure neighbor below it at (6, 4).\n7.  **Example 2 Analysis:**\n    *   The blue pixel at (1, 2) is to the right of the azure pixel at (1, 1). The azure pixel (1, 1) has an azure neighbor below it at (2, 1).\n    *   The blue pixel at (4, 4) is to the left of the azure pixel at (4, 5). The azure pixel (4, 5) has an azure neighbor above it at (3, 5).\n8.  **Pattern:** It appears that a white pixel changes to blue if and only if it is horizontally adjacent (left or right) to exactly one azure pixel, and that azure pixel is part of a vertical line segment of azure pixels (i.e., it has another azure pixel directly above or below it).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
