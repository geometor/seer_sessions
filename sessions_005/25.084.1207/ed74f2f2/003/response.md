"""
Identifies two 3x3 patterns (Left Pattern - LP, Right Pattern - RP) within the 
input grid at fixed locations: LP at grid[1:4, 1:4] and RP at grid[1:4, 5:8].
Calculates the count of gray pixels (5) in the logical OR of LP and RP ('or_count').
Determines an output color based primarily on 'or_count':
- If or_count is 6, 7, or 9, the color is Red (2).
- If or_count is 8, the color depends on the count of gray pixels in RP ('right_count'):
    - If right_count is 7, the color is Blue (1).
    - If right_count is 6, the color depends on the number of distinct gray objects 
      in RP (using 4-connectivity):
        - If 1 object, the color is Green (3).
        - If 2 objects, the color is Blue (1).
Constructs a 3x3 output grid where the shape matches the gray pixels of the RP, 
using the determined output color. Other cells are White (0).
