  - description: Input grid containing two separated 3x3 patterns within a white background.
    properties:
      height: Typically 5
      width: Typically 9
      colors_present: [white (0), gray (5)]
      objects:
        - object_type: subgrid
          name: Left Pattern (LP)
          location: Rows 1-3, Columns 1-3 (relative to top-left 0,0)
          dimensions: 3x3
          content: Mix of gray (5) and white (0) pixels
        - object_type: subgrid
          name: Right Pattern (RP)
          location: Rows 1-3, Columns 5-7 (relative to top-left 0,0)
          dimensions: 3x3
          content: Mix of gray (5) and white (0) pixels
        - object_type: separator
          location: Column 4 (relative to top-left 0,0)
          dimensions: 3x1 (within rows 1-3)
          content: All white (0) pixels
  - description: Output grid representing a transformation based on the input patterns.
    properties:
      height: 3
      width: 3
      colors_present: [white (0), one_other_color (1, 2, or 3)]
      derivation: Shape derived from RP, Color derived from comparison of LP and RP.

relationships_and_rules:
  - rule: Define LP as the 3x3 subgrid at input[1:4, 1:4].
  - rule: Define RP as the 3x3 subgrid at input[1:4, 5:8].
  - rule: Calculate L_count = number of gray (5) pixels in LP.
  - rule: Calculate R_count = number of gray (5) pixels in RP.
  - rule: Calculate OR_pattern = element-wise logical OR of LP and RP (treating 5 as True, 0 as False).
  - rule: Calculate OR_count = number of True values in OR_pattern.
  - rule: Determine output color C based on the following conditions:
      - If L_count equals R_count:
          - If L_count is 5, then C = 3 (Green).
          - If L_count is 4, then C = 2 (Red).
          - (Assumption: Other counts might map to other colors if encountered).
      - If L_count does not equal R_count:
          - If OR_count is 8, then C = 1 (Blue).
          - If OR_count is not 8 (e.g., 9), then C = 2 (Red).
          - (Assumption: Other OR_counts might map to other colors if encountered).
  - rule: Construct the 3x3 output grid. For each position (row, col):
      - If the pixel at RP[row, col] is gray (5), the output pixel at output[row, col] is C.
      - If the pixel at RP[row, col] is white (0), the output pixel at output[row, col] is white (0).
