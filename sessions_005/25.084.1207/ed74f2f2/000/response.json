            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids are typically 5x9, containing mostly white pixels (0) and some gray pixels (5). Within the central 3x5 area (rows 1-3), there appear to be two distinct 3x3 patterns of gray and white pixels. These patterns are located roughly at columns 1-3 and columns 5-7, separated by a column of white pixels (column 4). The surrounding border is white.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are consistently 3x3. They contain white pixels (0) and one other color, which varies between examples (Blue=1, Red=2, Green=3).\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve:\n    *   Identifying the two 3x3 gray/white patterns within the input grid. Let's call them the Left Pattern (LP) and the Right Pattern (RP).\n    *   Comparing properties of LP and RP to determine a single output color (C).\n    *   Generating the 3x3 output grid where the positions of the colored pixels (C) exactly match the positions of the gray pixels (5) in the Right Pattern (RP). Positions corresponding to white pixels (0) in RP remain white (0) in the output.\n4.  **Color Determination:** The specific color (C) used in the output depends on a comparison between LP and RP. Specifically, it seems related to the *number* of gray pixels in each pattern and potentially the result of a logical combination (like OR) of the patterns.\n    *   If the counts of gray pixels in LP and RP are equal, the color seems to depend on that count (e.g., count=5 -> Green, count=4 -> Red).\n    *   If the counts are unequal, the color seems to depend on the count of pixels that are gray in *either* LP *or* RP (e.g., OR_count=8 -> Blue, OR_count=9 -> Red).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
