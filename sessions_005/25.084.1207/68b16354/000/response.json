The content of the individual rows remains the same, but their order is reversed. The first row of the input becomes the last row of the output, the second row of the input becomes the second-to-last row of the output, and so on. This constitutes a vertical reflection or flip of the entire grid.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
