```python
"""
Transforms a grid based on adjacency rules for green (3) and red (2) pixels.
Specifically:
1. If a green (3) pixel has an adjacent (up, down, left, or right) red (2) pixel in the input grid, it becomes azure (8) in the output grid.
2. If a red (2) pixel has an adjacent green (3) pixel in the input grid, it becomes white (0) in the output grid.
3. All other pixels retain their original color.
The checks are based on the state of the input grid, meaning changes happen simultaneously based on the initial configuration.
