Gray (5) also appears but seems unaffected by the core transformation rule.\n3.  **Core Change**: The central observation is that certain green pixels change to azure, and certain red pixels change to white.\n4.  **Trigger Condition**: This change appears to be triggered by adjacency. Specifically, a green pixel changes if it's next to (sharing an edge, not just diagonally) a red pixel, and a red pixel changes if it's next to a green pixel.\n5.  **Specific Changes**:\n    *   Green (3) becomes Azure (8) if adjacent to Red (2).\n    *   Red (2) becomes White (0) if adjacent to Green (3).\n6.  **No Change**: Pixels that are not green or red, or are green/red but do not meet the adjacency condition with the other color, remain unchanged. This includes gray pixels, white pixels, green pixels not next to red, and red pixels not next to green.\n7.  **Simultaneity**: The check for adjacency seems to happen based on the *input* state. A green pixel changing to azure doesn't prevent an adjacent red pixel from changing to white based on the original presence of that green pixel.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
