task_type: pixel_transformation
grid_properties:
  - size_preservation: input and output grids have identical dimensions.
objects:
  - color: 3 # green
    role: conditional_source
    condition: changes if adjacent (von Neumann neighborhood) to a red (2) pixel.
    becomes: 8 # azure
  - color: 2 # red
    role: conditional_source
    condition: changes if adjacent (von Neumann neighborhood) to a green (3) pixel.
    becomes: 0 # white
  - color: 8 # azure
    role: conditional_target
    origin: green (3) pixels meeting the condition.
  - color: 0 # white
    role: background / conditional_target
    origin_as_target: red (2) pixels meeting the condition.
    behavior_as_background: remains unchanged if originally white.
  - color: 5 # gray
    role: static
    behavior: remains unchanged.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    definition: sharing an edge (up, down, left, or right neighbor), also known as von Neumann neighborhood.
    critical_pair: [green (3), red (2)]
    effect: triggers color transformation based on the rules above.
actions:
  - name: transform_pixel_color
    inputs: pixel color, neighboring pixel colors (based on input grid state)
    outputs: potentially new pixel color
    rules:
      - if pixel is green (3) AND has an adjacent red (2) neighbor: output azure (8)
      - if pixel is red (2) AND has an adjacent green (3) neighbor: output white (0)
      - otherwise: output original pixel color
