task_context:
  grid_size:
    input: fixed 10x10
    output: fixed 2x2
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - object_type: hollow rectangle
    count_per_input: 2
    properties:
      - color: variable (non-white)
      - size: variable (bounding box area)
      - position: separated vertically, one above the other
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    property: bounding box area
    between: the two input objects
transformation:
  - action: identify_objects
    target: non-white hollow rectangles in input
    count: 2
  - action: calculate_property
    property: bounding box area
    target: each identified object
  - action: compare_property
    property: bounding box area
    result: identify the object with the larger area
  - action: determine_color
    source: the object with the larger area
  - action: construct_output
    size: 2x2 grid
    content: fill with the determined color
