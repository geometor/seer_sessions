They contain a white (0) background.\n2.  **Input Objects:** Each input grid features exactly two distinct, non-white objects. These objects are hollow rectangular shapes (like picture frames). The objects are always separated vertically, with one above the other. They do not touch or overlap.\n3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are consistently 2x2.\n4.  **Output Content:** Each output grid is filled entirely with a single, solid color.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation seems to involve identifying the two objects in the input, comparing them based on some property, and then using the color of one of them to create the output.\n6.  **Color Selection Rule:**\n    *   In `train_1`, the top object is magenta (6) and the bottom is orange (7). The output is orange (7).\n    *   In `train_2`, the top object is orange (7) and the bottom is azure (8). The output is azure (8).\n    *   In `train_3`, the top object is yellow (4) and the bottom is red (2). The output is yellow (4).\n    *   Observing the sizes (bounding boxes):\n        *   `train_1`: Top is 4x5, Bottom is 4x7. Output is bottom color (orange). Bottom is larger.\n        *   `train_2`: Top is 4x5, Bottom is 4x6. Output is bottom color (azure). Bottom is larger.\n        *   `train_3`: Top is 7x7, Bottom is 3x3. Output is top color (yellow). Top is larger.\n    *   The rule appears to be: Identify the two non-white objects. Determine which object has the larger bounding box area. The output is a 2x2 grid filled with the color of that larger object.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
