Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** Both input grids have a distinct structure. The top portion consists solely of a single background color (Gray '5' in train_1, Green '3' in train_2). The bottom portion contains a pattern made of different colors laid over the same background color.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids. They are filled entirely by repeating the pattern found in the bottom part of the input grid.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies the background color, isolates the pattern from the bottom section of the input grid (discarding the uniform background top section), and then tiles or repeats this pattern vertically to fill the output grid.
4.  **Repetition Logic:** The way the pattern is repeated seems specific. It's not just simple tiling starting from the top of the pattern. In train\_1, the pattern (5 rows high) is repeated exactly twice to fill the 10-row output. In train\_2, the pattern (4 rows high) is repeated to fill a 10-row output. The output starts with the *last* 2 rows of the pattern, followed by two full repetitions of the 4-row pattern. This suggests a calculation based on the input height and pattern height (`10 % 4 = 2`, `10 // 4 = 2`).

## Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  description: "The task involves identifying a repeating pattern segment at the bottom of the input grid and using it to construct the output grid by repeating the segment vertically."
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: The color that fills the top portion of the input grid and is prevalent throughout. Identified by checking the top rows or the most frequent color.
    - pattern_block: A rectangular subgrid located at the bottom of the input grid, starting from the first row (from the top) that contains a non-background color.
    - input_height: The number of rows in the input grid.
    - pattern_height: The number of rows in the pattern_block.

transformation_details:
  - action: Identify the background color (e.g., color of the top-left pixel).
  - action: Determine the starting row (`R`) of the pattern_block by finding the first row containing any non-background pixel.
  - action: Extract the pattern_block from row `R` to the last row of the input grid.
  - calculation: Determine the height of the pattern_block (`H = input_height - R`).
  - calculation: Calculate the number of full repetitions needed (`N_full = input_height // H`).
  - calculation: Calculate the number of rows needed for a partial, leading repetition (`N_partial = input_height % H`).
  - action: If `N_partial` > 0, extract the last `N_partial` rows from the pattern_block to form the `partial_pattern`.
  - action: Construct the output grid (same dimensions as input) by:
      - Placing the `partial_pattern` at the top (if `N_partial` > 0).
      - Vertically concatenating `N_full` copies of the complete `pattern_block` below the `partial_pattern`.
  - result: The final constructed grid is the output.

examples:
  train_1:
    background_color: 5 (Gray)
    input_height: 10
    pattern_start_row: 5
    pattern_block: Input rows 5-9
    pattern_height: 5
    N_full: 2 (10 // 5)
    N_partial: 0 (10 % 5)
    partial_pattern: None
    output_composition: pattern_block + pattern_block
  train_2:
    background_color: 3 (Green)
    input_height: 10
    pattern_start_row: 6
    pattern_block: Input rows 6-9
    pattern_height: 4
    N_full: 2 (10 // 4)
    N_partial: 2 (10 % 4)
    partial_pattern: Last 2 rows of pattern_block (Input rows 8-9)
    output_composition: partial_pattern + pattern_block + pattern_block
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the height (`H_in`) and width (`W`) of the input grid.
2.  Identify the background color, typically the color of the pixel at the top-left corner (0, 0).
3.  Scan the input grid row by row, starting from the top (row 0), to find the index of the first row (`R`) that contains at least one pixel with a color different from the background color.
4.  If no such row exists (i.e., the grid is entirely the background color), the output grid is identical to the input grid.
5.  Otherwise, extract the "pattern block" which consists of the subgrid from row `R` down to the last row (`H_in` - 1).
6.  Calculate the height of this pattern block: `H_pattern = H_in - R`.
7.  Calculate the number of full pattern repetitions that fit into the output height: `N_full = H_in // H_pattern`.
8.  Calculate the number of rows required for a partial repetition at the beginning: `N_partial = H_in % H_pattern`.
9.  Initialize an empty output grid with dimensions `H_in` x `W`.
10. If `N_partial` is greater than 0, extract the last `N_partial` rows from the `pattern_block` and place them at the top of the output grid (from row 0 to `N_partial` - 1).
11. Starting from the row index where the partial pattern ended (or row 0 if `N_partial` was 0), append `N_full` complete copies of the `pattern_block` vertically until the output grid is filled.
12. Return the constructed output grid.
