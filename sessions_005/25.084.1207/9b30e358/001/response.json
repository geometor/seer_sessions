Determine the height (H_in) and width (W) of the input grid.\n2. Identify the background color, typically the color of the pixel at the top-left corner (0, 0).\n3. Scan the input grid row by row, starting from the top (row 0), to find the index of the first row (R) that contains at least one pixel with a color different from the background color.\n4. If no such row exists (i.e., the grid is entirely the background color), the output grid is identical to the input grid.\n5. Otherwise, extract the \"pattern block\" which consists of the subgrid from row R down to the last row (H_in - 1).\n6. Calculate the height of this pattern block: H_pattern = H_in - R.\n7. Calculate the number of full pattern repetitions that fit into the output height: N_full = H_in // H_pattern.\n8. Calculate the number of rows required for a partial repetition at the beginning: N_partial = H_in % H_pattern.\n9. Initialize an empty output grid with dimensions H_in x W.\n10. If N_partial is greater than 0, extract the last N_partial rows from the pattern_block and place them at the top of the output grid (from row 0 to N_partial - 1).\n11. Starting from the row index where the partial pattern ended (or row 0 if N_partial was 0), append N_full complete copies of the pattern_block vertically until the output grid is filled.\n12.
