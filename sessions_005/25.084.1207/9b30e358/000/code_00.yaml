task_context:
  description: "The task involves identifying a repeating pattern segment at the bottom of the input grid and using it to construct the output grid by repeating the segment vertically."
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: The color that fills the top portion of the input grid and is prevalent throughout. Identified by checking the top rows or the most frequent color.
    - pattern_block: A rectangular subgrid located at the bottom of the input grid, starting from the first row (from the top) that contains a non-background color.
    - input_height: The number of rows in the input grid.
    - pattern_height: The number of rows in the pattern_block.

transformation_details:
  - action: Identify the background color (e.g., color of the top-left pixel).
  - action: Determine the starting row (`R`) of the pattern_block by finding the first row containing any non-background pixel.
  - action: Extract the pattern_block from row `R` to the last row of the input grid.
  - calculation: Determine the height of the pattern_block (`H = input_height - R`).
  - calculation: Calculate the number of full repetitions needed (`N_full = input_height // H`).
  - calculation: Calculate the number of rows needed for a partial, leading repetition (`N_partial = input_height % H`).
  - action: If `N_partial` > 0, extract the last `N_partial` rows from the pattern_block to form the `partial_pattern`.
  - action: Construct the output grid (same dimensions as input) by:
      - Placing the `partial_pattern` at the top (if `N_partial` > 0).
      - Vertically concatenating `N_full` copies of the complete `pattern_block` below the `partial_pattern`.
  - result: The final constructed grid is the output.

examples:
  train_1:
    background_color: 5 (Gray)
    input_height: 10
    pattern_start_row: 5
    pattern_block: Input rows 5-9
    pattern_height: 5
    N_full: 2 (10 // 5)
    N_partial: 0 (10 % 5)
    partial_pattern: None
    output_composition: pattern_block + pattern_block
  train_2:
    background_color: 3 (Green)
    input_height: 10
    pattern_start_row: 6
    pattern_block: Input rows 6-9
    pattern_height: 4
    N_full: 2 (10 // 4)
    N_partial: 2 (10 % 4)
    partial_pattern: Last 2 rows of pattern_block (Input rows 8-9)
    output_composition: partial_pattern + pattern_block + pattern_block
