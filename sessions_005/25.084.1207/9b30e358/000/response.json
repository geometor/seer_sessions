            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Both input grids have a distinct structure. The top portion consists solely of a single background color (Gray '5' in train_1, Green '3' in train_2). The bottom portion contains a pattern made of different colors laid over the same background color.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids. They are filled entirely by repeating the pattern found in the bottom part of the input grid.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies the background color, isolates the pattern from the bottom section of the input grid (discarding the uniform background top section), and then tiles or repeats this pattern vertically to fill the output grid.\n4.  **Repetition Logic:** The way the pattern is repeated seems specific. It's not just simple tiling starting from the top of the pattern. In train\\_1, the pattern (5 rows high) is repeated exactly twice to fill the 10-row output. In train\\_2, the pattern (4 rows high) is repeated to fill a 10-row output. The output starts with the *last* 2 rows of the pattern, followed by two full repetitions of the 4-row pattern. This suggests a calculation based on the input height and pattern height (`10 % 4 = 2`, `10 // 4 = 2`).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify the background color, typically the color of the pixel at the top-left corner (0, 0).\n3.  Scan the input grid row by row, starting from the top (row 0), to find the index of the first row (`R`) that contains at least one pixel with a color different from the background color.\n4.  If no such row exists (i.e., the grid is entirely the background color), the output grid is identical to the input grid.\n5.  Otherwise, extract the \"pattern block\" which consists of the subgrid from row `R` down to the last row (`H_in` - 1).\n6.  Calculate the height of this pattern block: `H_pattern = H_in - R`.\n7.  Calculate the number of full pattern repetitions that fit into the output height: `N_full = H_in // H_pattern`.\n8.  Calculate the number of rows required for a partial repetition at the beginning: `N_partial = H_in % H_pattern`.\n9.  Initialize an empty output grid with dimensions `H_in` x `W`.\n10. If `N_partial` is greater than 0, extract the last `N_partial` rows from the `pattern_block` and place them at the top of the output grid (from row 0 to `N_partial` - 1).\n11.
