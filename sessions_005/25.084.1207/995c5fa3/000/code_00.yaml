task_context:
  - description: The task involves identifying patterns within three distinct subgrids of the input and mapping each pattern to a specific color to construct rows of the output grid.
input_grid:
  - property: dimensions
    value: 4x14 (height x width)
  - property: structure
    value: Contains three 4x4 subgrids separated by vertical white lines.
  - object: separators
    - property: color
      value: white (0)
    - property: location
      value: Column indices 4 and 9
  - object: subgrids
    - property: count
      value: 3
    - property: dimensions
      value: 4x4
    - property: location
      value: [Columns 0-3, Columns 5-8, Columns 10-13]
    - property: background_color
      value: gray (5)
    - property: content
      value: Contains distinct patterns formed by white (0) pixels or is entirely gray (5).
    - object: patterns
      - type: all_gray
        description: Subgrid contains only gray (5) pixels.
      - type: center_square
        description: A 2x2 square of white (0) pixels at rows 1-2, cols 1-2 relative to the subgrid.
      - type: bottom_square
        description: A 2x2 square of white (0) pixels at rows 2-3, cols 1-2 relative to the subgrid.
      - type: vertical_lines
        description: Two vertical lines of white (0) pixels at rows 1-2, cols 0 and 3 relative to the subgrid.
output_grid:
  - property: dimensions
    value: 3x3
  - property: structure
    value: Each row consists of a single color repeated three times.
  - relationship: Each row corresponds sequentially to an input subgrid (row 0 to subgrid 1, row 1 to subgrid 2, row 2 to subgrid 3).
transformation:
  - action: identify_subgrids
    input: input_grid
    output: three 4x4 subgrids
  - action: identify_pattern
    input: each 4x4 subgrid
    output: pattern type (all_gray, center_square, bottom_square, vertical_lines)
  - action: map_pattern_to_color
    rules:
      - pattern: all_gray
        output_color: red (2)
      - pattern: center_square
        output_color: azure (8)
      - pattern: bottom_square
        output_color: yellow (4)
      - pattern: vertical_lines
        output_color: green (3)
  - action: construct_output
    input: mapped colors for each subgrid (in order)
    output: 3x3 output grid where each row `i` is filled with the color mapped from subgrid `i+1`.
