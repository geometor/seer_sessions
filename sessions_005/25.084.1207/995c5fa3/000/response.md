Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input is consistently a 4x14 grid. It appears to be composed of three distinct 4x4 sections separated by vertical columns of white pixels (color 0) at column indices 4 and 9. The background color within the 4x4 sections is gray (color 5).
2.  **Subgrid Patterns:** Within each 4x4 section (subgrid), there's either no pattern (all gray), or a specific pattern formed by white pixels (color 0). I observed four distinct patterns across the training examples:
    *   All gray pixels.
    *   A 2x2 square of white pixels centered vertically and horizontally within the 4x4 subgrid.
    *   A 2x2 square of white pixels located at the bottom-center of the 4x4 subgrid.
    *   Two vertical lines of two white pixels each, positioned at the left and right edges (columns 0 and 3 relative to the subgrid) and centered vertically (rows 1 and 2 relative to the subgrid).
3.  **Output Structure:** The output is always a 3x3 grid. Each row of the output grid consists of a single color repeated three times.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve identifying the pattern within each of the three 4x4 input subgrids (reading from left to right) and mapping each pattern to a specific color. This color then forms a corresponding row in the output grid (reading from top to bottom). The mapping observed is:
    *   All gray pattern -> Red (2)
    *   Centered 2x2 white square pattern -> Azure (8)
    *   Bottom-center 2x2 white square pattern -> Yellow (4)
    *   Vertical white lines pattern -> Green (3)
5.  **Consistency:** The separators (white columns) and the overall grid structure (4x14 input, 3x3 output) are consistent across all examples. The mapping between the patterns and output colors is also consistent.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Divide the 4x14 input grid into three 4x4 subgrids by using the vertical white lines at columns 4 and 9 as delimiters. The subgrids are located at columns 0-3, 5-8, and 10-13.
2.  Initialize an empty list to store the output colors for each subgrid.
3.  For each subgrid, proceeding from left to right (first, second, third subgrid):
    a.  Examine the pattern of white (0) pixels within the 4x4 area against the gray (5) background.
    b.  Identify which of the four specific patterns is present:
        i.  **All Gray:** The subgrid contains only gray (5) pixels.
        ii. **Center Square:** A 2x2 white (0) square is present at rows 1-2 and columns 1-2 (using 0-based indexing relative to the subgrid's top-left corner).
        iii.**Bottom Square:** A 2x2 white (0) square is present at rows 2-3 and columns 1-2.
        iv. **Vertical Lines:** Two vertical lines of two white (0) pixels each are present at rows 1-2, columns 0 and 3.
    c.  Determine the output color based on the identified pattern:
        *   If the pattern is "All Gray", the color is red (2).
        *   If the pattern is "Center Square", the color is azure (8).
        *   If the pattern is "Bottom Square", the color is yellow (4).
        *   If the pattern is "Vertical Lines", the color is green (3).
    d.  Add the determined color to the list of output colors.
4.  Create a new 3x3 output grid.
5.  Fill the first row (row 0) of the output grid entirely with the first color from the list (corresponding to the leftmost input subgrid).
6.  Fill the second row (row 1) of the output grid entirely with the second color from the list (corresponding to the middle input subgrid).
7.  Fill the third row (row 2) of the output grid entirely with the third color from the list (corresponding to the rightmost input subgrid).
8.  Return the completed 3x3 output grid.
