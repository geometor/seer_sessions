task_description: Generate an output grid based on the location of a single white pixel in the input grid, using a modified checkerboard pattern.

input_features:
  - grid:
      description: A 2D grid of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
      properties:
        - Contains exactly one white (0) pixel.
        - Contains one other color acting as the background.
        - Dimensions vary (e.g., 5x5, 3x3, 7x7).
  - white_pixel:
      description: The single white (0) pixel in the input grid.
      properties:
        - location: (r0, c0)

output_features:
  - grid:
      description: A 2D grid of the same dimensions as the input.
      properties:
        - Contains white (0) pixels and the background color from the input grid.
        - The pattern of white pixels depends on the input white pixel location.

transformation_rules:
  - rule: Identify the background color (the non-white color) from the input grid.
  - rule: Identify the location (r0, c0) of the single white pixel in the input grid.
  - rule: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input.
  - rule: For each pixel at location (r, c) in the output grid:
      - action: Calculate the Manhattan distance `d = abs(r - r0) + abs(c - c0)`.
      - condition: Check if `d` is even.
      - condition: Check if the pixel is the source pixel itself ((r, c) == (r0, c0)).
      - condition: Check if the pixel is on the same row as the source pixel (r == r0).
      - condition: Check if the pixel is on the same column as the source pixel (c == c0).
      - assignment:
          if (d is even) AND ((r, c) == (r0, c0) OR (r != r0 AND c != c0)):
            set output pixel (r, c) to white (0).
          else:
            set output pixel (r, c) to the background color.
