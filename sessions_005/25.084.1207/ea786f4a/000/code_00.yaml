task_context:
  - description: Each input grid has a uniform background color with a single 'white' (0) pixel embedded within it.
  - grid_dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - colors_involved: White (0) and one other color (Red=2, Blue=1, Green=3) per example.

transformation_details:
  - name: Pattern generation based on distance from a central point.
  - input_objects:
      - type: background
        color: The dominant color in the input grid (e.g., Red, Blue, Green).
      - type: marker
        color: White (0)
        location: The coordinates (row, column) of the single white pixel.
        count: 1
  - output_objects:
      - type: grid pattern
        description: Pixels are colored based on their Manhattan distance from the input marker's location.
        colors:
          - White (0): Assigned to pixels where the Manhattan distance from the input marker is even.
          - Background color: Assigned to pixels where the Manhattan distance from the input marker is odd.
  - relationship: The color of each pixel in the output grid is determined by its Manhattan distance to the location of the single 'white' pixel in the input grid.

distance_metric:
  - name: Manhattan distance (L1 norm)
  - formula: |row1 - row2| + |col1 - col2|
  - application: Used to calculate the distance between each grid cell and the location of the input 'white' pixel.
