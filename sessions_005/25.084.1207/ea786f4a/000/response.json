            "text": "**Perception**\n\nThe input grid in each example consists primarily of a single solid color (red, blue, or green) with one distinct pixel of 'white' (color 0) located somewhere within the grid. The output grid maintains the same dimensions as the input grid. The transformation modifies the grid based on the position of the initial 'white' pixel. Specifically, the output grid displays a pattern where pixels alternate between 'white' and the original background color. This alternating pattern resembles a checkerboard or a distance-based coloring scheme originating from the initial 'white' pixel's location. The pixels that become 'white' in the output are those whose Manhattan distance (sum of absolute differences in row and column coordinates) from the original 'white' pixel is an even number (0, 2, 4, ...). Pixels with an odd Manhattan distance retain the original background color.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
