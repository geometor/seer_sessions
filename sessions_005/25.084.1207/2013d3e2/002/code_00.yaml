task_description: Extract a 3x3 subgrid from the input grid based on specific anchor points.
input_type: 2D grid of integers (colors)
output_type: 3x3 2D grid of integers (colors)

conditions:
  - name: blue_pixel_check
    description: Check if any blue pixels (color 1) exist in the input grid.
    outcome_1:
      name: blue_pixel_found
      description: At least one blue pixel exists.
      action:
        name: find_top_left_blue
        description: Locate the coordinates (r, c) of the blue pixel with the minimum row index, and then the minimum column index among those with the minimum row index.
        result: anchor_point = (r, c)
    outcome_2:
      name: no_blue_pixel
      description: No blue pixels exist in the input grid.
      action:
        name: find_non_white_bbox
        description: Determine the bounding box enclosing all non-white pixels (color > 0).
        sub_action: Find the minimum row (min_r) and minimum column (min_c) indices among all non-white pixels.
        result: anchor_point = (min_r, min_c)

final_action:
  name: extract_subgrid
  description: Extract a 3x3 subgrid from the input grid.
  details: The top-left corner of the 3x3 subgrid corresponds to the determined anchor_point (r, c). The extracted grid spans rows r to r+2 and columns c to c+2.
  output: The 3x3 extracted subgrid.
