The error in the original code's logic for the \"no blue pixel\" case was adding 1 to the row and subtracting 1 from the column, instead of just using the bounding box's top-left coordinates directly.\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the logic for Example 1, which involved locating the top-leftmost blue pixel and using its coordinates as the anchor for a 3x3 extraction. However, it applied an incorrect rule for Example 2 where no blue pixel was present. The failure in Example 2 highlighted that the logic for the absence of a blue pixel needed revision. The comparison between the failed output and the expected output for Example 2, combined with recalculating the bounding box of non-white pixels, revealed the correct rule for that scenario.\n\n## Metrics\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Input Size: 10x10\n- Output Size: 3x3\n- Blue Pixel (1) Present: Yes\n- Top-leftmost Blue Pixel Location: (1, 1)\n- Non-white Bounding Box Top-Left: (1, 1)\n- Extraction Start Point (Rule 1 - Blue Pixel): (1, 1)\n- Code Result: Correct\n\n**Example 2:**\n- Input Size: 10x10\n- Output Size: 3x3\n- Blue Pixel (1) Present: No\n- Non-white Bounding Box Top-Left: (2, 2) (Verified via code execution)\n- Extraction Start Point (Rule 2 - No Blue Pixel): (2, 2)\n- Original Code Extraction Start Point: (3, 3) - Incorrect\n- Revised Logic Extraction Start Point: (2, 2) - Correct\n- Code Result (Original): Incorrect (Pixels Off: 5)\n- Code Result (Revised Logic): Correct\n\n## Facts\n\n"
