"""
Identify the starting point for a 3x3 extraction from the input grid based on the following rules:
1. Find the coordinates (r, c) of the top-leftmost blue pixel (color 1).
2. If a blue pixel is found, the extraction starts at (r, c).
3. If no blue pixel is found:
    a. Find the minimum row index (min_r) and minimum column index (min_c) containing any non-white pixel (color > 0).
    b. The extraction starts at (min_r + 1, min_c - 1).
Extract the 3x3 subgrid from the input grid starting at the determined coordinates.
