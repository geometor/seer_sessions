task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
    - Most pixels are white (0).
  input_elements:
    - Contains exactly two non-white pixels.
    - These two pixels ('endpoints') are located on the same row.
    - In the examples, the endpoints are at the horizontal boundaries (first and last column).
  output_elements:
    - The row containing the original endpoints is modified.
    - All other rows remain unchanged.
    - The space between the endpoints on their row is filled.
  transformation:
    - Finds the two non-white pixels (endpoints).
    - Identifies the row they share.
    - Calculates the horizontal midpoint column between the endpoints.
    - Fills the row segment between the left endpoint and the midpoint with the left endpoint's color.
    - Fills the row segment between the midpoint and the right endpoint with the right endpoint's color.
    - Colors the midpoint pixel gray (5).

objects:
  - object: endpoint_1
    description: The leftmost non-white pixel.
    properties:
      - color: C1 (e.g., green=3, blue=1)
      - row: R
      - column: C_left
  - object: endpoint_2
    description: The rightmost non-white pixel.
    properties:
      - color: C2 (e.g., orange=7, red=2)
      - row: R
      - column: C_right
  - object: fill_segment_1
    description: The horizontal segment filled with color C1.
    properties:
      - row: R
      - columns: from C_left + 1 to midpoint_col - 1
      - color: C1
  - object: fill_segment_2
    description: The horizontal segment filled with color C2.
    properties:
      - row: R
      - columns: from midpoint_col + 1 to C_right - 1
      - color: C2
  - object: midpoint_pixel
    description: The pixel exactly in the middle of the endpoints horizontally.
    properties:
      - row: R
      - column: midpoint_col = floor((C_left + C_right) / 2)
      - color: gray (5)

relationships:
  - Endpoint 1 and Endpoint 2 are on the same row (R).
  - Fill Segment 1 is to the right of Endpoint 1 and to the left of Midpoint Pixel.
  - Fill Segment 2 is to the right of Midpoint Pixel and to the left of Endpoint 2.
  - Midpoint Pixel separates Fill Segment 1 and Fill Segment 2.

actions:
  - Find the row (R) and columns (C_left, C_right) and colors (C1, C2) of the two non-white pixels.
  - Verify they are on the same row.
  - Calculate the midpoint column: midpoint_col = floor((C_left + C_right) / 2).
  - For each column 'col' from C_left + 1 up to (but not including) midpoint_col, set the pixel at (R, col) to color C1.
  - Set the pixel at (R, midpoint_col) to gray (5).
  - For each column 'col' from midpoint_col + 1 up to (but not including) C_right, set the pixel at (R, col) to color C2.
  - Copy the input grid to the output grid initially to preserve unchanged pixels.
