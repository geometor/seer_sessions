The rest of the grid is white.\n\nThe transformation modifies only the row containing these two pixels. The space *between* these two endpoint pixels is filled in. The filling is partitioned:\n1.  The segment from the left endpoint (exclusive) up to the horizontal midpoint is filled with the color of the left endpoint pixel.\n2.  The segment from the horizontal midpoint (exclusive) up to the right endpoint is filled with the color of the right endpoint pixel.\n3.  The single pixel exactly at the horizontal midpoint between the two endpoints is colored gray (5).\n\nThe original endpoint pixels retain their positions and colors. All other rows remain unchanged (white).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
