            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input Data:** The inputs are 9x9 grids containing pixels of different colors: white (0), blue (1), and red (2). Green (3) appears in some examples but seems irrelevant.\n2.  **Output Data:** The outputs are consistently 1x5 grids containing only blue (1) and white (0) pixels.\n3.  **Objects:** The most prominent objects within the input grids appear to be solid 2x2 squares of blue pixels and solid 2x2 squares of red pixels. Other shapes and colors exist but might be distractors.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves analyzing the input grid to count specific objects (the 2x2 squares) and then producing a fixed-size output grid whose pattern depends on the relative counts of these objects. The spatial arrangement of the squares within the input grid does not seem to affect the output pattern, only their counts matter.\n5.  **Core Logic:** The task seems to be about comparing the *quantity* of blue 2x2 squares versus red 2x2 squares. Based on which color has more 2x2 squares, a specific predefined 1x5 pattern is chosen as the output.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
