  - observation: |

  - observation: |

  - rule_1: |
      If the non-black color appears once, the output grid is 1x1.
  - rule_2: |
      If the non-black color appears twice, the output grid is 1x2.
  - rule_3: |
      If the non-black color appears three times, the output grid is 1x3.
  - rule_4: |
     If the non-black color appears four times, the output grid is 1x4.
