## train_1

**input:**
```
2 2 2
2 1 8
2 8 8
```


**output:**
```
2 2 2
2 5 5
2 5 5
```


## train_2

**input:**
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (representing colors). The input and output grids have the same dimensions in all provided examples. The transformation seems to focus on specific color changes within the grid, particularly targeting colors other than the most prevalent one in the top row. The color `5` (gray) consistently appears in the output where non-prevalent colors in the top row were in the input.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - object: Grid: A 2D array of integers (colors).
  - property: Color: Each cell in the grid has a color value (0-9).
  - property: TopRow: The first row of the grid.
  - property: prevalent_color: The color that is most repeated in the first row.
  - action: ColorReplacement: Specific colors in the input grid are replaced in the output grid.
  - relationship: colors_to_change: input grid colors that are not the prevalent color in the top row.
  - relationship: ReplacementColor: Colors are replaced with color 5 (gray).
  - constraint: Only change the colors that were not the prevalent colors in the top row.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the prevalent color:** Determine the most frequent color in the top row of the input grid.
2.  **Identify target colors**: find all the colors in the entire grid that don't match the prevalent color.
3.  **Replace target colors:** In the output grid, replace all instances of all the target colors (found in previous step) with the color 5 (gray). All other colors remain unchanged.
