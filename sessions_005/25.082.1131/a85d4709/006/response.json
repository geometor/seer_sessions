            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the natural language program and the subsequent code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were overly simplistic, focusing primarily on the position of '5's and attempting to map specific arrangements to color patterns for the top, middle, and bottom sections of the output grid.  It correctly handled some cases (Examples 2 and 3) but failed on others (Examples 1 and 4). The core issue is that the logic is too rigid and doesn't generalize well. It seems to be trying to memorize specific patterns rather than deriving a general rule. The anti-diagonal and main diagonal conditions are too restrictive.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze all four examples, focusing on the *relationship* between the '5's and the output colors, rather than just their absolute positions.\n2.  **Identify the Core Rule:** The consistent element seems to be a *division into three horizontal bands*, and the coloring of these bands seems related to which rows the 5s are on.\n3.  **Develop a More General Rule:** We'll rephrase the natural language program to be more flexible and less tied to specific diagonal or column arrangements.\n4.  **Refine the Logic:** The key seems to be to determine if there are the correct number of 5's, then assigning each one the correct value.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using code execution - no changes needed here):**\n\nNo code execution is needed here. The provided results already offer sufficient metrics: counts of matching/mismatched pixels, size correctness, color palette correctness.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
