The transformation rule maps input grids containing 0s and 5s to output grids of the same size filled entirely with either 2, 3, or 4, based on the diagonal arrangement of the 5s in the input grid.

- If 5s form the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right), the output is all 3s.
- If 5s are present and they are in top-left and bottom-right corner, the output is all 2s.
- If 5s form the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) the number of 5 above

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code were too simplistic, focusing primarily on strict diagonal patterns of '5's. The test results reveal a more nuanced rule that considers partial diagonals and potentially the relative positioning of '5's. The code needs to handle cases where '5's don't form a perfect diagonal but still exhibit a diagonal-like arrangement. The current code fails in cases where there is a deviation, and returns an all 3 output (which is only expected for the 5's forming a perfect main diagonal). There also seems to be some mix of concepts here. Example 3 highlights the significance of upper and lower sections. Example 4 also contains a clue.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I need to meticulously examine each example, noting:
    *   The exact positions of '5's.
    *   The relationship between the '5's (e.g., are they close to a diagonal, mirrored across an axis, etc.).
    *   The expected output and how it relates to the '5's positions. The different sections.

2.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Based on the detailed analysis, I'll revise the natural language program to incorporate the more complex rules. This may involve introducing concepts like "partial diagonals," "mirroring," or "relative positioning."
3. **Consider Other Geometric Properties**

**Natural Language Program:**

The output grid is divided into three horizontal sections (top, middle, and bottom) and these are assigned different color values based upon the relative location of 5 in the input. When the input grid contains 5s, these define a section.
If the 5s are along the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right), the entire output is filled with 3s. If the 5s form sections top, middle and bottom, a value is assigned to that area, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
If the 5's are in a line in the right-most column, then the output are all 3. If the five's appear along an approximate anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left), split the grid into top, middle and bottom sections and color respectively 4, 4, and 2. The input is divided into sections, and output values are 2, 3, and 4 depending on position.
