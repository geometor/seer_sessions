            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis (90-degree clockwise rotation) is incorrect. While the output grid dimensions are correct (swapping rows and columns), the pixel arrangement within the grid is wrong in all test cases. This indicates a fundamental flaw in the understanding of the transformation. A simple rotation is not sufficient to explain the changes. We need to re-evaluate the relationship between input and output, looking for a different pattern. It's likely a mirroring or reflection operation, potentially combined with some conditional logic.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Careful Visual Inspection:**: Visually compare each input-output pair, paying very close attention to how individual pixels or groups of pixels change position. Label each pixel with its coordinates.\n2.  **Identify Invariants:** Look for pixels that *don't* change, as these can be clues to the underlying rule.\n3.  **Hypothesize and Test:** Formulate new hypotheses about the transformation (e.g., reflection across a vertical or horizontal axis, or a more complex rearrangement) and write the natural language program.\n4.  **Metrics Gathering:** Use code to perform targeted analysis of color shifts.\n5. **Refine Natural Language Program and code:** improve on the generated program and test it again until all examples pass.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (using code execution):**\n\nSince the visual comparison is the key here, and the prior run provided the pixel differences, I'm going to focus on analyzing one specific example more deeply to illustrate a different approach, and I will use the code tool. I'll take Example 1 and compare it with the output.\n\n"

This can be achieved by exchanging the values of columns while retaining the row indices.\n\nThe core process is:\n\n1.  **Identify the central vertical axis:** For grids with an odd number of columns, this is the middle column. For grids with an even number of columns, the \"axis\" conceptually falls between the two central columns.\n2.  **Swap Columns:** For each row, swap the pixel value at column *i* with the pixel value at column *(width - 1 - i)*, where *width* is the number of columns in the grid. Do this for all columns to the left of the central axis.\n3. The result is a mirrored version of the input grid.\n"
