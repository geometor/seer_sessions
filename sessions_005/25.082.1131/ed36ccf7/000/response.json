The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the pixels within the grid, specifically a rotation or reflection. The colors (represented by digits) remain the same, but their positions change. It appears that some kind of rotational symmetry, or perhaps a reflection operation, is key to understanding this transformation.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
