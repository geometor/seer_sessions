The transformation rule is to reverse the order of the rows of the input grid to produce the output grid. The content of each row remains unchanged; only their vertical position within the grid is altered. Specifically:

1.  Take the input grid.
2.  Reverse the order of the rows. The first row of the input becomes the last row of the output. The second row of the input becomes the second-to-last row of the output, and so on, proceeding until the last row of the input become the top row of the output.
3. The result is the output grid.
