The core operation seems to involve identifying a non-zero \"seed\" pixel and using it to generate a surrounding frame. The zero values seem to act as a background or empty space that gets filled in around the seed. There are two distinct, consistent shapes in the examples: one is a square and the other is plus shape.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
