objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: rows x cols
      - elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - seed_pixel:
          definition: The first non-zero pixel encountered when traversing the grid from top-left to bottom-right.
          properties:
            - x: row index of the seed pixel
            - y: column index of the seed pixel
            - color: value of the seed pixel
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: same as input_grid
      - elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)

actions:
  - name: identify_seed
    input: input_grid
    output: seed_pixel (x, y, color)
    description: Locates the seed pixel within the input grid.

  - name: create_frame
    input: output_grid, seed_pixel
    output: output_grid
    description:  Draws a rectangular frame of the seed_pixel's color on the edges of the output_grid.

  - name: clear_seed_and_neighbors
    input: output_grid, seed_pixel
    output: output_grid
    description: Sets the seed pixel and its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) in the output_grid to 0.

  - name: fill_inner
    input: output_grid, seed_pixel
    output: output_grid
    description: Fills the remaining '0' cells within the frame with the seed color.
