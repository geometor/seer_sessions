Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The core operation seems to involve identifying a non-zero "seed" pixel and using it to generate a surrounding frame. The zero values seem to act as a background or empty space that gets filled in around the seed. There are two distinct, consistent shapes in the examples: one is a square and the other is plus shape.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids contain a single non-zero pixel, acting as a "seed".
  - observation: |
      Output grids maintain the original dimensions of the input grids.
  - observation: |
     The single non-zero pixel is replaced by the value `0`.
  - observation: |
      Output grids have a rectangular frame of the seed color, one pixel thick, filling the outer edges.
  - observation: |
      The seed color's location is always on the center of the frame.
  - observation: |
      All the `0` in the original input are replaced by the seed color except the immediate neighbors of the `0` replacing the original seed color.
  - object: Seed pixel
    properties:
      color: Non-zero value in the input grid.
      location: Center of the input grid.
    actions:
      - Replaced by '0'.
  - object: Output frame
    properties:
      color: Same as the seed pixel's original color.
      shape: Rectangular, one pixel thick.
      size: Matches the dimensions of the input grid.
    actions:
      - Fills the entire outer edge of the output grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the seed:** Find the single non-zero pixel in the input grid and note its color and its x,y coordinates.
2.  **Create output grid:** Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with zeros.
3.  **Replace the seed** Set the pixel to `0` at the same x,y coordinates as the seed pixel.
4.  **Draw the frame:** Replace all zeros on the outer perimeter of the output grid with the color of the seed pixel.
5. **Fill the frame** Set all `0` in the output frame to the seed color except the pixels at \[x+1,y], \[x-1,y], \[x,y-1], \[x, y+1].
