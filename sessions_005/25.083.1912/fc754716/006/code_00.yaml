objects:
  - name: Input Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - description: Contains a single "seed" pixel, which is the first non-zero value.

  - name: Seed Pixel
    properties:
      - location: (x, y) coordinates in Input Grid
      - color: integer value (1-9)
      - description: The first non-zero pixel in the Input Grid.

  - name: Output Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - description:  A grid of the same dimensions as the input grid. It is constructed with a frame of the seed pixel's color, and zeros in the position of the seed pixel and its direct neighbors.

actions:
  - name: Find Seed
    input: Input Grid
    output: Seed Pixel (location and color)
    description: Locate the first non-zero pixel in the Input Grid.

  - name: Create Frame
    input: Seed Pixel color, Input Grid dimensions
    output: Output Grid
    description: Create a frame using the seed pixel's color around the edges of the Output Grid.

  - name: Clear Neighbors
    input: seed pixel coordinates, and Input Grid
    output: modified input grid
    description: set the value of the seed pixel and orthogonal neighbors to 0
