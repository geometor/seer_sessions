            "text": "Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation doesn't seem to involve complex spatial manipulations like rotations or reflections. It appears to be a reordering or swapping of rows based on some criteria related to the content of the rows. The size of the grid remains constant between input and output. It doesn't look like any new colors/digits are introduced; the output grid is a rearrangement of the input grid's rows.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify:** Treat each row in the input grid as a distinct object.\n2.  **Sort (Implicit):** Mentally sort, or at the very least 'compare', the rows based on some observable property.\n3. **Observation**: Looking at train\\_1 input vs output, the first row starting with '2' in the input is gone.\n4. **Observation**: The input rows that start with '6' are sorted by the colors that appear *after* the starting color.\n5.  **Reconstruct:** Construct the output grid by reordering the rows based on the sorting from step two and with the following rules:\n\n    *   Rows that start with certain colors are moved.\n    *   Rows that start with the same colors are sorted and placed at the end.\n\n    *   Train\\_1:\n\n        *   Remove any rows that start with 2\n        *   Sort rows starting with 6 by the next color value, these are put at the bottom\n    *   Train\\_2\n        *   Rows starting with 6 are moved to the bottom\n        *   Rows starting with 9 are sorted\n        *   Rows starting with 2,3,4 are removed.\n    *   Train\\_3\n        *    Rows starting with 6 moved to bottom, then sorted\n        *    Rows starting with 2 are removed.\n\n6.  **Generalized Rule:** The rule looks to be a bit inconsistent across the examples. I will need more data to determine what is happening to the rows that are 'removed'. I will need more data to determine how the rows are being sorted. I suspect there is a key color, or a key color set, that determines behavior.\n\nI need more example pairs, specifically designed to clarify the sorting and filtering criteria. I will focus my next set of questions on sorting and filtering.\n"
