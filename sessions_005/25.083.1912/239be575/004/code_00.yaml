observations:
  - task: Identify the most frequent leading digit in rows of a 2D grid.
  - objects:
      - type: grid
        properties:
          - rows: lists of integers
          - leading_digit: the first digit in a row
  - actions:
    - count_leading_digits: Count occurrences of each digit as a leading digit.
    - find_max_frequency: Determine the digit(s) with the highest count.
    - resolve_ties: If multiple digits have the same highest count, apply a tie-breaking rule, the exact tie-breaker rule is underspecified and needs refinement.
  - constraints:
    - Input: 2D array (grid) of integers.
    - Output: A single integer.
