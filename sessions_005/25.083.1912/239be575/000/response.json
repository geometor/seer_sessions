The output is always a single digit integer. The inputs appear to have no consistent size/dimensions, varying in both width and height across the examples. The core task seems to be identifying a specific, single color/digit based on some property or pattern within the input grid. The prominent colors are blue (1), red (2), and azure (8), with white (0) acting potentially as a background or separator.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
