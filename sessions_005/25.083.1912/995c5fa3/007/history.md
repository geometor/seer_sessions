1.  **Identify Input Rows with White:** Scan the input grid to identify all rows containing at least one white (0) pixel. Record the indices of these rows and the number of white pixels in each.

2.  **Determine Output Grid Size:**
    *   The output grid's width is always 3.
    *   The output grid's height is always 3.

3.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an output grid of size 3x3, filled initially with zeros.

4.  **Map Colors to Output Rows:**
    * All examples have white pixels in every row.
    * Iterate through the *indices* of the rows that contain white pixels (which will always be 0, 1, 2, and 3 because every row contains at least one white pixel). The color assigned to each output row is determined by looking at all examples and seems to be consistent, and unrelated to the number of white pixels.:

    - Row with white index `0` corresponds to output row index 0.
    - Row with white index `1` corresponds to output row index 1.
    - Row with white index `2` corresponds to output row index 2.

    - output row 0 gets color 2 (red).
    - output row 1 gets color 8 (azure).
    - output row 2 gets color 3 (green).

5.  **Populate Output Rows:** For each output row, set all its cells to the mapped color.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of identifying rows with white pixels and mapping them to output rows with fixed colors was partially correct but flawed. While the output size (3x3) is consistently correct, and some examples use colors that are in the current color map, the mapping between input rows and output colors is incorrect and inconsistent across all examples. The initial assumption that the *order* of rows containing white pixels dictates the output color is wrong. There's a more complex relationship at play. It seems like the examples are actually selecting colors independent of the white pixels.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Discard White Pixel Focus:** The presence of white pixels seems to be a distractor. The core logic doesn't depend on *where* the white pixels are, or their count within a row. We need to shift our focus.
2.  **Analyze Color Mapping Directly:** We must analyze the input-output pairs to discern a direct mapping between some characteristic of the *input* and the colors used in the *output*.
3. **Consider input grid features:** Since the presence of white is universal and therefore not helpful, we should consider other features of the input grids, for example, size.
4. **Re-examine Examples**: Look at the color mapping in *all* examples, looking for a different pattern.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - height: varies (but is consistently 4 across provided examples)
      - width: varies
      - contains_white: True (all rows in all examples contain white pixels)

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - height: constant (3)
      - width: constant (3)
      - colors: vary, not directly related to the order of white pixels in the input
    transformation:
      - rule: "Output grid is always 3x3. The color of each output row appears to relate to the example number in some way.  Input grids all have the same height (4)"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Determine Output Grid Size:** The output grid is always 3x3.

2.  **Determine Output Colors:**
    *   The colors assigned to each row of the output grid do not correlate with the position or count of white pixels. All the input grids have a height of 4. The colors appear in a pattern that differs by example. We need more examples to establish the pattern.

3. **Populate Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 grid.
    *   Example 1 uses colors [8, 2, 4]
    *   Example 2 uses colors [3, 4, 2]
    *   Example 3 uses colors [2, 4, 2]
    *   Example 4 uses [2, 8, 3]
    *  Populate each row of the output grid with these colors.

The next step is to re-write the `transform` function and test this refined understanding against all examples, and consider what additional data or analysis we would need to resolve this completely.
