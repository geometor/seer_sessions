Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs, focusing on identifying the transformation logic:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input grids are 10x10, filled mostly with black (0) pixels.
*   There are colored pixels forming shapes within the black background.
*    The shapes appear to be contiguous regions of non-black pixels.
*   The output grids are smaller and seem to contain a condensed version of the non-black pixels from the input.
*   The output appears to preserve some of the spatial relationships, but in an altered aspect ratio.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 10x10
      - background_color: black (0)
    elements:
      - type: shape
        description: Contiguous non-black pixels
        properties:
          - colors: [various] # List of colors present in the shapes

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (smaller than input)
    elements:
      - type: shape_representation
        description: Condensed representation of input shapes

  - action: extract_subgrid
    description: A subgrid of the non-zero pixels appears to be extracted

  - action: alter_aspect_ratio
     description: aspect_ratio appears to altered from the source subgrid

  - relationship: spatial_preservation
    description: Relative positions of colored pixels are roughly maintained, but compressed.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Bounding Box:** Find the smallest rectangle within the input grid that contains all non-black pixels. This defines a region of interest.
2.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the subgrid with the non-black pixels.
3.  **Select Top Left Corner:** Take the 3x3 subgrid that starts with top left corner of the subgrid containing all non-black colors.
4. **Return the selected grid**

Essentially, the transformation identifies the significant colored part of the input, extracts the subgrid, and returns the 3x3 section in the top left.
