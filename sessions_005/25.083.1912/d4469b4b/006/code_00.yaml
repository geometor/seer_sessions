facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid is always 3x3.
  - observation: |
      If the input grid contains all zeros, the output grid is also all zeros (white).
  - observation: |
      If the input grid has any non-zero values, a cross-shaped pattern appears in the output.
  - observation: |
      The cross is always made of gray (value 5) pixels.
  - observation: |
      The cross consists of 5 pixels.
  - observation: |
     The cross shape has the center pixel filled, and adjacent up, down, left, right pixels.
  - observation:
      Based on the max column of the input, if it less than input_column_length * (2/3), then the cross is centered at column index 1. Otherwise at column index 2.

    inputs:
      - input_grid: The original input grid (any size).
    outputs:
      - output_grid: A 3x3 grid containing a gray cross or all zeros.
    parameters:
        center_column: |
            Determined by analyzing distribution on non-zero pixels in the input grid.
            If the maximum column index of any non-zero pixel is less than two-thirds of input_column_length,
            the output cross center is column index 1, otherwise index 2.
