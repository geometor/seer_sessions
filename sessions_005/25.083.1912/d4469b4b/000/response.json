Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs are rectangular grids of varying sizes, filled with single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.\n*   The outputs are smaller, rectangular grids, also filled with integers, seemingly derived from the input grids.\n*   The output grids consistently use only '0' and '5', representing white and gray.\n*   There's a noticeable reduction in dimensions from input to output. The output appears to capture some essence of the input in a condensed form.\n*   The non-zero values in the input grid do not seem to be directly present in the output, it transforms into gray (5).\n*   The position and arrangement of the input non-zero values seem to influence the output structure.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Zero values remain unchanged or become 5.\n  - action: pattern_extraction\n    description: The output grid seems to extract a central pattern or \"core\" from the input grid.\n  - observation: output_shape\n    description: The output grid is always 3x3, filled with white(0) and gray(5).\n  - observation: input_non_zero_effect\n    description: Input grids containing non-zero numbers gives a \"cross\" pattern of gray(5) in the ouput grid.\n\n```"

If there is no non-zero, returns all zeros 3 x 3 grid.\n    *   The middle row is all gray (5).\n    *   The middle column is all gray (5).\n    *   Remaining cells stay white(0).\n\nIn summary, the transformation extracts a simplified representation, by creating a 3x3 \"cross\" pattern of gray pixels, if there is any non-zero values in input. It provides an abstraction of the presence and rough location of non-zero elements in the input.\n"
