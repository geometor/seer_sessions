The input grids appear to be divided into roughly four quadrants or sections by a '0' (white) border, and two of the quadrants are filled, while two are not, and contain only white.\nThe transformation seems to select one of the colored blocks, preserve it, transpose it, and stack it with the alternating colored blocks with 0 (white) in betweeen. The output grid consistently has a height of 3 and removes the '0' (white) separators columns and rows, keeping only the relevant colored blocks.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
