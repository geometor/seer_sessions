Record the color and length of each block.\n3.  **Determine Output Grid Width:**\n    *   Calculate the frequency of each block length across *all* rows of the input grid.\n    *   The output grid width seems correlated to the most frequent length. Let's refine later if needed.\n4.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid with a height of 3 and the width determined in step 3.\n5.  **Populate First Output Row:**\n    *   Find the first block in the input grid with a length greater than or equal to the output width.  Use its color to fill the *entire* first row of the output. If the input block is longer than the output width, truncate.\n6.  **Populate Second Output Row:**\n    *  Find the next distinct color block (i.e., different color from the first row) in the input grid (scanning from the beginning) that has a length of at least the output grid width. Use this second block's color to fill the *entire* second row of the output. If the block length in the input exceeds the output width, take the first segment.\n7.  **Populate Third Output Row:** Fill the third row of the output grid with zeros (color 0).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef get_blocks_per_row(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies contiguous non-zero color blocks in each row of the grid.\n    Returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains tuples of (color, length) for a row.\n    \"\"\"\n    all_rows_blocks = []\n    for row in grid:\n        row_blocks = []\n        current_color = None\n        current_block_length = 0\n        for pixel in row:\n            if pixel != 0:\n                if current_color is None:\n                    current_color = pixel\n                    current_block_length = 1\n                elif pixel == current_color:\n                    current_block_length += 1\n                else:\n                    row_blocks.append((current_color, current_block_length))\n                    current_color = pixel\n                    current_block_length = 1\n            elif current_color is not None:\n                row_blocks.append((current_color, current_block_length))\n                current_color = None\n                current_block_length = 0\n        if current_color is not None:\n            row_blocks.append((current_color, current_block_length))\n        all_rows_blocks.append(row_blocks)\n    return all_rows_blocks\n\ndef determine_output_width(all_rows_blocks):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the output width based on block length frequencies.\n    Prioritizes the first encountered repeated block length.\n    \"\"\"\n    block_lengths = []\n    for row_blocks in all_rows_blocks:\n        for color, length in row_blocks:\n            block_lengths.append(length)\n\n    counts = Counter(block_lengths)\n\n    # Iterate through block lengths in order of appearance\n    for row_blocks in all_rows_blocks:\n      for color, length in row_blocks:\n        if counts[length] > 1: # check if a length appears more than once\n          return length\n\n    # if we made it this far, check if there are ANY counts\n    # this should only happen in a edge or error condition\n    if len(counts) > 0:\n       return counts.most_common(1)[0][0]\n\n    return 1 # default to 1 if no blocks found (should not happen)\n\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Analyze Input Rows and Identify Color Blocks\n    all_rows_blocks = get_blocks_per_row(input_grid)\n\n    # Determine Output Grid Width\n    output_width = determine_output_width(all_rows_blocks)\n\n    # Create Output Grid\n    output_grid = np.zeros((3, output_width), dtype=int)\n\n    # Populate First Output Row\n    first_block_found = False\n    for row_blocks in all_rows_blocks:\n        for color, length in row_blocks:\n            if length >= output_width or (not first_block_found and length>0) :\n                output_grid[0, :] = color\n                first_block_found = True\n                break\n        if first_block_found:\n            break\n\n    # Populate Second Output Row\n    second_block_found = False\n    first_color = output_grid[0,0]\n    for row_blocks in all_rows_blocks:\n        for color, length in row_blocks:\n            if (length >= output_width or (not second_block_found and length > 0)) and color != first_color:\n                output_grid[1, :] = color\n                second_block_found = True\n                break\n        if second_block_found:\n          break\n\n    # Populate Third Output Row (already initialized to zeros)\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
