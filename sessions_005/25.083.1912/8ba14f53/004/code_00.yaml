  - context: |
      The task involves transforming a 2D grid of colored pixels into another 2D grid of colored pixels.
      The input grids have varying heights and widths, while output grids consistently have a height of 3.
      The input grids contain contiguous blocks of non-zero colored pixels, separated by zeros.
      The lengths of the color blocks varies.
  - objects:
    - name: Input Grid
      properties:
        - type: 2D array
        - values: Integers (0-9 representing colors)
        - height: Variable (observed as 4 in all examples)
        - width: Variable (observed as 9 in all examples)
    - name: Output Grid
      properties:
        - type: 2D array
        - values: Integers (0-9 representing colors)
        - height: Constant (3)
        - width: Variable, related to a consistent block size of the input.
    - name: Color Block
      properties:
        - type: Contiguous sequence of pixels
        - value: Same non-zero integer
        - length: Variable
  - actions:
    - name: Identify color blocks
      description: Find contiguous non-zero pixels of the same color in the input grid.
    - name: Determine consistent block length
