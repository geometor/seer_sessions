  - task_id: 0e985493
  - input_size: 8x8
  - output_size: 3x6
  - input_colors: [0, 1, 2, 8]
  - output_colors: [0, 1, 2, 8]
  - example_1:
    - observation_1: "Output row 0 corresponds to input row 1, but elements are resampled/skipped."
    - observation_2: "Output row 1 takes elements in order from input row 6 and 7."
    - observation_3: "Output row 2 takes colors from input rows 7, skipping some of them."
  - example_2:
    - observation_1: "Output row 0 takes values from Input row 1."
    - observation_2: "Output row 1 takes values from Input row 3, skipping some of them."
    - observation_3: "Output row 2 seems to be taking values from Input row 2."
  - example_3:
      - observation_1: "Output row 0 takes values from Input row 1."
      - observation_2: "Output row 1 takes values from Input row 3, skipping elements"
      - observation_3: "Output row 2 takes values from Input row 3, skipping elements."
  - general_rule: "The output grid is always 3x6. There's a relationship between input rows and output rows, but it's not a simple 1:1 mapping. Elements are being skipped or resampled."
