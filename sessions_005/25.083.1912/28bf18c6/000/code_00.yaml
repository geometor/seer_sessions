facts:
  - observation: Input and output are grids of different dimensions.
  - observation: Output grid dimensions are smaller than input grid dimensions.
  - observation: The non-zero colors in the input grid are present in the output grid.
  - observation: The output grid appears to select and rearrange elements from input grid.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 8x8, 8x8, 8x8)
      - elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable, smaller than input (e.g., 3x6, 3x6, 3x6)
      - elements: integers (0-9 representing colors), a subset of the input elements
    actions:
      - derived_from: input_grid
  - relationship: The output grid is derived from the input grid by selecting and transforming based on color.
