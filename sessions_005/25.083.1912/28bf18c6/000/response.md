Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are rectangular grids of varying dimensions, filled with single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors.
*   **Objects:**  Contiguous blocks of the same color can be considered objects.
*   **Symmetry/Pattern:** There's a clear sense of either reflection, mirroring, or a patterned extraction and rearrangement of the input grid's elements in the output. It is not a simple rotation.
*   **Color Preservation:** While the positions change, the colors present in the input generally appear in the output.
*   **Output Size:** The output grid is smaller than the input grid in all examples. It appears to be roughly half the height and width, skipping every other row and column. It is selecting some subset of the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output are grids of different dimensions.
  - observation: Output grid dimensions are smaller than input grid dimensions.
  - observation: The non-zero colors in the input grid are present in the output grid.
  - observation: The output grid appears to select and rearrange elements from input grid.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 8x8, 8x8, 8x8)
      - elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable, smaller than input (e.g., 3x6, 3x6, 3x6)
      - elements: integers (0-9 representing colors), a subset of the input elements
    actions:
      - derived_from: input_grid
  - relationship: The output grid is derived from the input grid by selecting and transforming based on color.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Color:** In each input grid, identify the non-zero color that forms the primary object or pattern (i.e., the color that is *not* the background, which is always 0/white in these examples).
2.  **Extract Columns:** From the input grid, extract every alternate column, starting from the *second* column that contains the target color.
3.  **Extract Rows:** From the extracted columns, keep only rows starting from the *first* row and extract alternate rows.
4.  **Construct Output:** Form the output grid using the extracted sub-grid of values. Fill the output grid starting from the top-left.

Another simpler, alternate version, that describes the same actions

1. Examine every other column of the input, starting with the second column containing a non-zero value.
2. Within those columns, take the values of every other row, starting with the first row
3. Construct the output grid from those values.
