  - task: "ARC Task"
  - objects:
    - description: "2D grids of colored pixels"
      properties:
        - width: "variable, between 1 and 30"
        - height: "variable, between 1 and 30"
        - cells: "integers 0-9 representing colors"
  - transformation:
    - type: "column extraction and remapping"
    - input: "original grid"
    - output: "grid consisting of two rightmost columns of input, with remapped values"
    - steps:
      - extract: "the two rightmost columns of the input grid"
      - remap: "each pixel in the extracted columns based on its original value and its column index (0 for the first extracted column, 1 for the second)"
  - observations:
      - example_1: "Values of the first of the rightmost two columns are transformed"
      - example_2: "Some values are consistent with example_1, some are different"
