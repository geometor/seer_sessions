objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9)
      properties:
        - height: variable
        - width: variable
        - color: determined by integer value

  - columns:
      type: sub-section of grid
      properties:
        - position: relative to grid (rightmost)
        - count: two
        - content: integers

transformations:
  - extraction:
      input: rightmost two columns of the input grid
      output: new grid
      details: maintains relative positions of pixels from the selected columns

relationships:
   - input grid contains columns
   - output grid is composed of extracted columns

invariants:
   - zeros (white space) is consistent between the input and output
