Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits, representing colors.
*   The input grids have varying sizes, but seem to share common colors (0, 8, 4, 5).
*    The output grids also share dimensions (4 columns)
*   The output grids predominantly feature the color '2' (red) and '0' (white/background).
*   There's a noticeable spatial relationship change between input and output. It seems like a specific pattern or object in the input determines the placement of '2's in the output.
*   Color 4 (yellow) is always in the 5th column of the input grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
observations:
  - input_grids:
      - description: "2D arrays of digits (0-9), representing colors."
        properties:
          - "Variable dimensions."
          - "Common colors: 0, 8, 4, 5."
          - "Color 4 always located in the 5th column."
  - output_grids:
      - description: "2D arrays of digits, primarily 0 and 2."
        properties:
          - "Consistent 4 columns."
          - "Predominant colors: 0 and 2."
  - relationships:
      - description: "Spatial transformation from input to output."
        details:
          - "Position of '2' in output seems related to specific pattern/object in input."
          - "The color 4 (yellow) acts like an anchor, and is transformed into
            the right most edge of the red (color 2) in the output"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the "Anchor":** Find the column containing the digit '4' (yellow) in the input grid. This is the 5th column.

2.  **Construct Output Dimensions**: The number of columns in the output is always
    4. The number of rows is the same as in the input grid

3.  **Populate with Red:** The output grid will be constructed with color red
    (value 2) up to and including the "anchor" column from the input.

4. **Remainder is background:** All other cells in the output should have a
   value of 0 (color white or background).

In summary, The output grid takes on the number of rows from the input, and the
number of columns is 4. We find column 5 in the input (color 4), and transform it
to an output where every column to it's left is filled with the color red
(value 2), with all other values being 0.
