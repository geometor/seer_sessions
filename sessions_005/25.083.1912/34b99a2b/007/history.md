"""
1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid with the same number of rows as the input grid and 4 columns. All cells are initially set to 0.
2.  **Row Iteration:** For each row in the input grid:
    a. **Locate Yellow Pixel:** Find the yellow pixel (value 4) in the current row.
    b. **Subgrid Extraction:** Extract a subgrid from the input grid based on the yellow pixel's location.
        - The yellow pixel's column dictates the extraction logic. We want to extract the two columns to its left.
        - Ideally, extract a 2x2 subgrid. The yellow pixel's location serves as a guide (conceptually the lower-right corner of the 2x2 area).
        - If a 2x2 subgrid cannot be formed because the yellow pixel is too close to the edges (top, bottom, or left side):
            - If the yellow pixel is one from the top edge, take one row below.
            - If the yellow pixel is at the very left edge, the subgrid width will be 0 and we won't be able extract anything to the left of it, and thus no valid subgrid is produced.
            -If the yellow pixel is one away from the left edge, we extract only one column on the left side.
    c. **Subgrid Rotation:** If a valid subgrid (of any dimensions) was extracted: rotate it by 180 degrees if it is 2x2, or transpose if not. If a 2x0 subgrid exists, do not rotate or place.
    d. **Subgrid Placement:** Place the rotated subgrid (or the original, if it was not 2x2) into the output grid. The placed subgrid starts at column 0 of the output grid and occupies the same row(s) as the current row being processed in the input grid.
3.  **Output:** The final output grid is the result of this transformation.

## Example 4:
Error: could not broadcast input array from shape (2,1) into shape (1,1)
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to address the errors:

**General Assessment:**

The errors "could not broadcast input array from shape (x,y) into shape (a,b)" indicate a shape mismatch during the subgrid placement phase. This happens when `output_grid[sub_r_start:sub_r_start + rotated_subgrid.shape[0], 0:rotated_subgrid.shape[1]] = rotated_subgrid` tries to assign a `rotated_subgrid` of one shape into a slice of `output_grid` that has a different, incompatible shape. The errors show this is consistently happening and the shape (2,1) is being assigned to shape (1,1). This seems to indicate that the subgrids in all the examples provided is a 2x1 array and the row the yellow pixel is found is always r, not r and r+1.

My strategy is as follows:

1.  **Inspect all examples:** I need to examine *all* the training input/output pairs, not just rely on the error messages from the initial code. I'll use a `tool_code` block to print the shapes of the input grids, locate the yellow pixels, and determine the dimensions of the extracted subgrids.
2.  **Analyze Placement Logic:** I'll carefully re-examine the placement logic in the natural language program and the corresponding code. The goal is to understand precisely *why* the shapes are mismatched. It is likely that the row placement needs to be changed from `sub_r_start:sub_r_start + rotated_subgrid.shape[0]` to `r:r + 1`.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the detailed analysis, I'll rewrite the natural language program to correctly describe the subgrid extraction, rotation (if any), and *precise* placement rules. I will be extra cautious about edge cases.
4.  **Update Code:** I will use this analysis and adjust the code.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid with the same number of rows as the input grid and 4 columns.  All cells in the output grid are initially set to 0 (white).

2.  **Row Iteration:** For each row in the input grid:

    a. **Locate Yellow Pixel:** Find the *first* yellow pixel (value 4) in the current row. If no yellow pixel is found in a row, that row in the output grid remains all zeros.

    b. **Subgrid Extraction:** If a yellow pixel is found at column `c` in row `r`, extract a subgrid from the input grid.
        -   The subgrid always starts at row `r`
        -   The subgrid extends at most two columns to the *left* of the yellow pixel.
        -   The subgrid's width is determined by how close the yellow pixel is to the left edge of the input grid. The right edge of the subgrid is always one position left of the yellow pixel.
            -   If the yellow pixel is at the very left edge (column 0), the subgrid has a width of 0.
            -   If the yellow pixel is one column away from the left edge (column 1), the subgrid has a width of 1.
            -   If the yellow pixel is two or more columns away from the left edge, the subgrid has a width of 2.
        - The subgrid's height is *always* 1.

    c. **Subgrid Transposition:** If a valid subgrid (width > 0) was extracted, *transpose* the subgrid. This changes a 1xN subgrid to an Nx1 subgrid.

    d. **Subgrid Placement:** Place the transposed subgrid into the output grid.
       -   The transposed subgrid is placed starting at column 0 of the output grid.
       -   The subgrid is placed in the *same row* (`r`) as the yellow pixel in the input grid.

3.  **Output:** The final output grid is the result of the transformation.
