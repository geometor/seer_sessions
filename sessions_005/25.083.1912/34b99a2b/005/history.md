1.  **Output Grid Size:** The output grid always has 4 columns, and the same number of rows as the input grid.
2.  **Yellow Anchor:** In each input row, there's always a yellow (4) pixel in the 5th column (index 4).  This seems to serve as an anchor point.
3.  **Input Transformation to Output**: Extract 2 x 2 subgrids from the input, using the coordinates of the yellow pixels in each row as the lower-right corner of the subgrid. Rotate each extracted subgrid by 180 degrees.
4. Place each rotated 2x2 subgrid into the output grid with the following rule:
    - Use the row index from the input.
    - The rotated subgrid will occupy column indices 0,1 and 2,3 of the output.

Okay, here's an analysis of the situation and a plan to address the errors, along with the requested deliverables.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and generated code were based on the first training example. The errors encountered in subsequent examples reveal that the initial assumptions were too narrow and didn't account for variations in the input grids, specifically when approaching the boundaries (edges) of those grids.

The errors "could not broadcast input array from shape (2,1) into shape (1,2)" and similar indicate problems in the way subgrids are extracted and placed in the output, especially with the 1x2 and 2x1 subgrids instead of 2x2.

The core issue stems from how the code handles cases where a full 2x2 subgrid cannot be extracted because the yellow anchor point is too close to the edges of the input grid. The initial attempt to handle edge cases was insufficient, and it is producing dimension mismatches.

The strategy will be to:

1.  **Analyze each example:** Use code execution to inspect the input grids, focusing on the location of the yellow pixel and the dimensions of the input grid.
2.  **Refine Subgrid Extraction:** Improve the logic for extracting subgrids, ensuring correct handling for all edge cases, including top, bottom, left and right boundaries. The original assumption about the yellow pixel always has enough pixels for 2x2 is incorrect, so the code must be more robust.
3.  **Refine Placement Logic:** Ensure the placement of the (potentially rotated) subgrids into the output grid aligns with the dimensions of the subgrid.

**Data Gathering and Metrics (using Code Execution)**

I'll use a `tool_code` block to analyze each example input, focusing on the yellow pixel's location, the input grid dimensions, and the subgrid extraction dimensions.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid with the same number of rows as the input grid and 4 columns. All cells are initially set to 0.

2.  **Row Iteration:** For each row in the input grid:

    a. **Locate Yellow Pixel:** Find the yellow pixel (value 4) in the current row.

    b. **Subgrid Extraction:** Extract a subgrid from the input grid based on the yellow pixel's location.
        - The yellow pixel's column dictates the extraction logic. We want to extract the two columns to its left.
        - Ideally, extract a 2x2 subgrid. The yellow pixel's location serves as a guide (conceptually the lower-right corner of the 2x2 area).
        - If a 2x2 subgrid cannot be formed because the yellow pixel is too close to the edges (top, bottom, or left side):
            - If the yellow pixel is one from the top edge, take one row below.
            - If the yellow pixel is at the very left edge, the subgrid width will be 0 and we won't be able extract anything to the left of it, and thus no valid subgrid is produced.
            -If the yellow pixel is one away from the left edge, we extract only one column on the left side.

    c. **Subgrid Rotation:** If a valid subgrid (of any dimensions) was extracted: rotate it by 180 degrees if it is 2x2, or transpose if not. If a 2x0 subgrid exists, do not rotate or place.

    d. **Subgrid Placement:** Place the rotated subgrid (or the original, if it was not 2x2) into the output grid. The placed subgrid starts at column 0 of the output grid and occupies the same row(s) as the current row being processed in the input grid.

3.  **Output:** The final output grid is the result of this transformation.
