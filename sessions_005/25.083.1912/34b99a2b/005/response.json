All cells are initially set to 0.\n2.  **Row Iteration:** For each row in the input grid:\n    a. **Locate Yellow Pixel:** Find the yellow pixel (value 4) in the current row.\n    b. **Subgrid Extraction:** Extract a subgrid from the input grid based on the yellow pixel's location.\n        - The yellow pixel's column dictates the extraction logic. We want to extract the two columns to its left.\n        - Ideally, extract a 2x2 subgrid. The yellow pixel's location serves as a guide (conceptually the lower-right corner of the 2x2 area).\n        - If a 2x2 subgrid cannot be formed because the yellow pixel is too close to the edges (top, bottom, or left side):\n            - If the yellow pixel is one from the top edge, take one row below.\n            - If the yellow pixel is at the very left edge, the subgrid width will be 0 and we won't be able extract anything to the left of it, and thus no valid subgrid is produced.\n            -If the yellow pixel is one away from the left edge, we extract only one column on the left side.\n    c. **Subgrid Rotation:** If a valid subgrid (of any dimensions) was extracted: rotate it by 180 degrees if it is 2x2, or transpose if not. If a 2x0 subgrid exists, do not rotate or place.\n    d. **Subgrid Placement:** Place the rotated subgrid (or the original, if it was not 2x2) into the output grid. The placed subgrid starts at column 0 of the output grid and occupies the same row(s) as the current row being processed in the input grid.\n3.  **Output:** The final output grid is the result of this transformation.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef rotate_180(subgrid):\n    \"\"\"Rotates a 2x2 subgrid by 180 degrees.\"\"\"\n    return np.rot90(subgrid, 2)\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    cols = 4\n    output_grid = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=int)\n\n    # iterate through rows\n    for r in range(rows):\n        # locate yellow pixel\n        yellow_col = -1\n        for c in range(input_grid.shape[1]):\n            if input_grid[r, c] == 4:\n                yellow_col = c\n                break\n\n        # subgrid extraction\n        if yellow_col != -1:  # Ensure yellow pixel was found\n            sub_r_start = r\n            sub_c_start = max(0, yellow_col - 2) # at most 2 columns to the left\n            sub_r_end = min(rows, r + 2)\n            sub_c_end = yellow_col\n\n            # extract the subgrid with corrected bounds, handling edge cases directly.\n            subgrid = input_grid[sub_r_start:sub_r_end, sub_c_start:sub_c_end]\n\n            # subgrid rotation and placement\n            if subgrid.size > 0:  # Ensure subgrid is not empty\n                if subgrid.shape == (2, 2):\n                    rotated_subgrid = rotate_180(subgrid)\n                else:\n                    rotated_subgrid = subgrid.T  # Transpose for non-square subgrids\n\n                # Place the subgrid correctly.
