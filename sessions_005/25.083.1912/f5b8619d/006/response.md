Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of doubling the dimensions and expanding non-zero pixels into 2x2 blocks was partially correct. However, the filling of remaining cells with '8' (azure) is not universally accurate. The placement and repetition of the original non-zero pixels is also incorrect. It looks like a pattern of 2x2 expansion and alternating fill is needed, but the existing logic isn't handling the interleaving correctly. The strategy should be to revise the pixel expansion and filling logic to properly interleave expanded pixels and fill pixels.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Let's break down each example and pinpoint specific issues.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (6, 6)
    *   Output Shape: (12, 12)
    *   Issue: Incorrect expansion of the '5' (gray) pixels. They appear as solid 2x2 blocks without the azure interleaving. Also looks like expansion is happening, incorrectly, even on zero value inputs.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Output Shape: (6, 6)
    *   Issue: Similar to Example 1, the '2' (red) pixels expand into 2x2 blocks, but the surrounding '8' (azure) filling isn't interleaved correctly. Also the zeros are not handled correctly.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (2, 2)
    *   Output Shape: (4, 4)
    *    Issue: Zero expansion and incorrect interleaving.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: twice the input_grid dimensions (height * 2, width * 2)
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - action: expand_pixels
    description: Each pixel in input_grid is potentially transformed into a 2x2 block in output_grid.
    details:
      - Non-zero pixels are involved.
      - Zero pixels also have a transformation rule, that is not simply replacement.

  - action: fill_pixels
    description: The transformation takes place in a 2x2 grid, some cells of which will have the same color, other cells will be value 8.

  - pattern: output_grid shows a checkboard
    details: the checkboard is created from the pixels of input_grid, and azure (8).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double Dimensions:** Create an output grid with dimensions double that of the input grid (height \* 2, width \* 2).

2.  **Iterate 2x2 Input:** Iterate through the input grid taking each pixel and performing the following expansion and filling logic.

3.  **Expand and Fill:** The transformation logic creates 2x2 output based on each single input:
    - Zeros in the input become the pattern: `8 I`, `8 8` where `I` is the pixel to the immediate right in the input, or 8 if it does not exist.
    - Non-Zero values `N` in the input are expanded into a 2x2 block using the pattern `N 8`, `8 N`.

4.  **Output:** Return the final output grid.
