objects:
  - name: Input Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: (height, width) - variable
      - cells: integers 0-9, representing colors
      - non-zero_cells:  represent colors other than white (0)
      - zero_cells: represent white (0)

  - name: Output Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: (2 * input_height, 2 * input_width)
      - cells: integers 0-9, representing colors
      - expanded_cells: 2x2 blocks corresponding to non-zero cells in the input grid
      - fill_cells: cells with value 8 (azure)

actions:
  - name: Expand
    description: Each non-zero cell in the input grid is transformed into a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid.
    input: non-zero cell
    output: 2x2 block of the same color

  - name: Fill
    description: The remaining cells in the output grid that are not part of an expanded 2x2 block are filled with the color 8 (azure). The precise position is crucial - fill happens *after* the expansion.
    input: empty cell in output grid
    output: cell filled with 8
