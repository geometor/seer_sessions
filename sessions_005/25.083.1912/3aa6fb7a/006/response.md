Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation description:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were on the right track, focusing on the relationship between azure (8) and blue (1) pixels. However, the code incorrectly adds blue pixels *around* every azure pixel, effectively creating a "halo" or "border." The expected outputs show a more selective addition of blue pixels, extending azure only on certain sides. It appears the extension happens only where azure pixels exist, and does only one cell.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output for *each* example. Focus on *where* the blue pixels are added correctly and incorrectly. This will help pinpoint the flaw in the current logic.
2.  **Refine the Rule:** The core idea of "extending" azure is correct, but the conditions need refinement. We need to identify the specific spatial relationship between azure and the *correctly* placed blue pixels.
3.  **Object-Oriented Description** Focus on the existing azure structures. The blue pixels "fill" the area immediately adjacent to those.

**Metrics and Observations (using visual inspection, not code execution for this dreamer stage):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Observation:** The code adds blue around *all* sides of the azure blocks. The expected output only adds blue to "fill in" the empty space where azure already forms an L or a straight line, so as to not create diagonal connections.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Observation:** Similar to Example 1, the code over-adds blue. The expected output only extends the azure where there already is more than one adjacent azure, continuing the azure shape.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: azure_region
    description: One or more contiguous azure (8) pixels.
    properties:
      - shape: Can be any shape (line, L, block, etc.)
      - color: azure (8)
  - object: added_blue
    description: Blue pixels added adjacent to azure regions.
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - placement_rule: Added only to empty (0) cells that are directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to the azure_region, and only if the azure region contains multiple pixels connected in a line to another azure cell.
  - action: extend_azure
    description: The process of adding blue pixels to fill in empty space adjacent to existing shapes
    preconditions:
      - An azure_region exists.
      - Empty (0) cells are directly adjacent to the azure_region.
    postconditions:
      - Blue (1) pixels fill those adjacent locations.
      - No new azure pixels are created.
      - No connections between azure pixels occur diagonally.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels. Consider each of these regions as a single "object."
2.  **Locate Potential Extensions:** For each azure region, find all empty (0) cells that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right â€“ *not* diagonally) to any azure pixel in that region.
3. **Conditional Blue Fill:** For any cell identified as a candidate, fill it with a blue (1) pixel if the azure pixel it is adjacent to also has another azure pixel that is directly adjacent to *it*.
4.  **Result:** The output grid is the same as the input grid, except for the blue pixels added according to the rule above. No azure pixels are changed or removed.

This program focuses on *extending* existing azure shapes by checking for two adjacent azure pixels, not creating entirely new blue regions or connecting separate azure regions. It explicitly excludes diagonal connections.
