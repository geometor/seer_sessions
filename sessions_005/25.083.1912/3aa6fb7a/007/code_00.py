"""
1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels. Consider each of these regions as a single "object."
2.  **Locate Potential Extensions:** For each azure region, find all empty (0) cells that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right â€“ *not* diagonally) to any azure pixel in that region.
3. **Conditional Blue Fill:** For any cell identified as a candidate, fill it with a blue (1) pixel if the azure pixel it is adjacent to also has another azure pixel that is directly adjacent to *it*.
4.  **Result:** The output grid is the same as the input grid, except for the blue pixels added according to the rule above. No azure pixels are changed or removed.
