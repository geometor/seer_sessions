facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - description: Contains a vertical line of '1's.
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - description: Seems to be derived from the input grid, focusing on the area around the vertical line of '1's.
      - shape: always 3 columns
  - action: color_substitution
    description: '9' in the input becomes '8' in the output, other colors are kept as `0` in a 3 wide column window, centered on column `1`.
  - relationship:
    subject: output_grid
    predicate: is_derived_from
    object: input_grid
    details: The output grid extracts a 3-column slice around the vertical line of '1's in the input grid and perform the color substitution.
