objects:
  - id: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - contains multiple colors (0-9)
      - has a horizontal separator line of '4's

  - id: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - smaller than input_grid
      - primarily filled with '3's
      - contains some '0's

  - id: separator_line
    type: object
    color: 4
    properties:
      - horizontal
      - divides the input grid into two regions

  - id: upper_region
    type: region
    properties:
      - located above the separator_line
      - the focus of the transformation

  - id: lower_region
    type: region
    properties:
      - located below the separator_line
      - may influence the transformation, possibly as a mask

actions:
  - name: transform
    description: Converts the upper region of the input grid to the output grid.
    input: upper_region
    output: output_grid

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The input grid contains the upper_region, lower_region, and separator_line.
  - type: influence
    description: The '0's in the upper_region of the input seem to correspond to the '0's in the output.
