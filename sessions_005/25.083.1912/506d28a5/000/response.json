Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The input consists of a larger grid with various colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9).\n*   There is a distinct horizontal line of '4's (yellow) separating two regions of the grid.\n*   The upper region seems to be the primary focus of the transformation.\n*   The lower region with '1's (blue) appears to act as some form of a mask or influence, although its precise role is unclear at first glance.\n*   The output is a smaller grid, consistently filled with '3's (green) except for some '0's (white) that appear to correlate with the '0's in the upper region of the input grid.\n* It seems the number of rows in output grid always equal to number of rows above line with number 4.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Ignore the portion of the grid *below* this separator line.\n\nIn essence, the transformation extracts the upper region of the input grid (above the yellow line), and replaces all non-zero values with '3' (green), retaining only the '0's in their original positions. The lower section of the input grid (below the yellow line) has no bearing on the output.\n"
