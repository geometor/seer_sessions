            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Each example consists of an input grid and an output grid of the same dimensions. The dimensions vary between examples (9x9, 8x8, 9x9).\n2.  **Colors:** The dominant color is orange (7), acting as the background. Other colors present are yellow (4), blue (1), red (2), and azure (8).\n3.  **Objects:**\n    *   The background is orange (7).\n    *   There are always two distinct yellow (4) objects (shapes). Their positions vary but seem confined to corner regions.\n    *   There is always exactly one other non-orange, non-yellow object (blue in ex 1, red in ex 2, azure in ex 3).\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The orange background generally stays the same, except where the moving object was.\n    *   The yellow objects remain completely static; their position and color do not change between input and output.\n    *   The single non-orange, non-yellow object *moves* to a new location in the grid.\n    *   The pixels where the moving object was originally located are replaced with the background color (orange, 7).\n5.  **Movement Rule:** The key challenge is determining *how* the object moves. Observing the examples:\n    *   In example 1, the yellow objects are in the top-left and bottom-right areas. The blue object moves by (+3 rows, -5 columns).\n    *   In examples 2 and 3, the yellow objects are in the top-right and bottom-left areas. The red/azure object moves by (+4 rows, +5 columns).\n    *   This strongly suggests the *relative configuration* of the two static yellow objects dictates the movement vector (change in row, change in column) applied to the single moving object.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify the two objects colored yellow (4). These are the static anchors.\n4.  Identify the single remaining object (which is not yellow and not the background color). This is the moving object. Record its color and the coordinates of all its pixels.\n5.  Determine the relative positioning of the two yellow anchor objects. For instance, check if one is generally in the top-left quadrant and the other in the bottom-right quadrant, OR if one is in the top-right and the other in the bottom-left.\n6.  Based on this relative positioning, select the corresponding movement vector:\n    *   If the yellow anchors are positioned top-left and bottom-right, the movement vector is `(delta_row = 3, delta_col = -5)`.\n    *   If the yellow anchors are positioned top-right and bottom-left, the movement vector is `(delta_row = 4, delta_col = 5)`.\n7.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n8.  For each pixel belonging to the moving object in the input grid, change its color in the output grid to the background color identified in step 1.\n9.  For each pixel belonging to the moving object, calculate its new coordinates by adding the selected movement vector (`new_row = old_row + delta_row`, `new_col = old_col + delta_col`).\n10. For each calculated new coordinate, set the pixel color in the output grid to the original color of the moving object.\n11. Return the modified output grid."
