task_context:
  - grid_dimensions_preserved: True
  - background_color: 7 (orange)
  - number_of_examples: 3

objects:
  - type: static_anchors
    color: 4 (yellow)
    count: 2
    description: Two distinct yellow shapes, typically located in opposite corner regions. Their position is fixed.
    role: Determine the movement vector for the moving object based on their relative configuration.
  - type: moving_object
    color: variable (1-blue, 2-red, 8-azure, but not 4-yellow or 7-orange)
    count: 1
    description: A single object composed of a color other than yellow or orange.
    role: This object is translated within the grid.
  - type: background
    color: 7 (orange)
    role: Fills the space not occupied by other objects and replaces the original location of the moving object.

relationships_and_actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: [static_anchors, moving_object, background_color]
  - action: determine_anchor_configuration
    inputs: static_anchors (positions)
    outputs: configuration_type (e.g., 'top_left_bottom_right', 'top_right_bottom_left')
    logic: Analyze the relative positions of the centroids or bounding boxes of the two yellow objects.
  - action: determine_movement_vector
    inputs: configuration_type
    outputs: movement_vector (delta_row, delta_col)
    logic: Map configuration_type to a specific vector.
      - If 'top_left_bottom_right', vector is (3, -5).
      - If 'top_right_bottom_left', vector is (4, 5).
  - action: apply_movement
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - moving_object (pixels and original color)
      - movement_vector
      - background_color
    outputs: output_grid
    logic:
      - Create a copy of the input grid.
      - Erase the moving object from its original position by setting its pixels to the background color.
      - Calculate the new position for each pixel of the moving object by adding the movement_vector to its original coordinates.
      - Draw the moving object (using its original color) at the new calculated positions on the grid copy.

output_grid_generation:
  - based_on: Applying the determined movement vector to the moving object, updating the grid accordingly.
