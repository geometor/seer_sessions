    description: Represents objects that move horizontally leftwards.

rules:
  - rule_id: movement
    description: >
      Each 'mover' (green pixel) shifts left within its row.
    conditions:
      - The path to the left must not contain an 'obstacle' (azure pixel).
      - Movement stops at the column immediately to the right of the first encountered 'obstacle' or the column 0 if no obstacle is met.
    action: >
      The 'mover' pixel relocates to the determined destination column in the same row.
      The original location of the 'mover' becomes 'background' (white), unless the destination is the same as the origin.
  - rule_id: stacking
    description: >
      Handles collisions where multiple 'movers' in the same row target the same destination column.
    conditions:
      - Multiple 'movers' in row 'r' calculate the same initial target column 'c_target'.
    action: >
      The 'movers' occupy consecutive columns starting from 'c_target', moving rightwards (c_target, c_target + 1, ...).
      The assignment preserves the original relative horizontal order: the leftmost original 'mover' takes the leftmost final position ('c_target').

unchanged_elements:
  - 'obstacle' pixels (azure 8)
  - 'background' pixels (white 0) that are not replaced by moving 'movers' and were not original locations of 'movers'.
