task_description: Replace objects of a specific color (azure) with copies of other existing objects (patterns), preserving the location based on top-left coordinates and cycling through patterns if necessary.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains_objects: true

  - type: object
    properties:
      - composed_of: contiguous pixels of the same or different non-background colors
      - identified_by: color composition and connectivity

  - type: target_object
    identified_by:
      - color: exclusively azure (8)
    properties:
      - bounding_box: defines spatial extent
      - top_left_coordinate: defines position for ordering and replacement anchor
    actions:
      - is_identified
      - is_ordered (based on top-left coordinate: row then column)
      - is_removed
      - its_location_determines_placement_of: pattern_object

  - type: pattern_object
    identified_by:
      - color: any non-background color except azure (8)
      - can be monochrome or composite color
    properties:
      - shape_and_color_pattern: the specific arrangement of pixels within the object
      - bounding_box: defines spatial extent
      - top_left_coordinate: defines position for ordering
    actions:
      - is_identified
      - is_ordered (based on top-left coordinate: row then column)
      - is_copied
      - copy_is_placed_at: location determined by a target_object
      - original_instance_is_removed_or_ignored_in_output (except for its role as a pattern)

relationships:
  - rule: Ordering
    applies_to: target_objects, pattern_objects
    based_on: top-left coordinate (row index first, then column index)
  - rule: Replacement
    source: ordered list of pattern_objects
    destination: ordered list of target_objects
    mechanism:
      - map pattern `i % num_patterns` to target `i`
      - placement_anchor: top-left corner of target's bounding box aligns with top-left corner of pattern object copy
    effect: target_objects are replaced by copies of pattern_objects in the output grid

output_grid:
  content: background color + copies of pattern_objects placed at target locations
  size: same as input grid
