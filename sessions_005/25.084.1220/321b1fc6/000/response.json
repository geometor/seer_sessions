Their previous locations are now occupied by copies of the *other* shapes present in the input.\n3.  **Colors:** Azure (8) seems to be a special color acting as a placeholder or target marker. The other colors (orange=7, magenta=6 in `train_1`; orange=7, magenta=6, maroon=9, yellow=4 in `train_2`) form \"pattern\" objects. The background is white (0).\n4.  **Objects:** Objects are contiguous blocks of non-white pixels. Some objects are monochrome (like the azure ones and the orange/magenta ones in `train_1`), while others can be composite (like the object in `train_2`).\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying all azure objects and all non-azure objects. The azure objects are then replaced by copies of the non-azure objects.\n6.  **Replacement Logic:**\n    *   The non-azure objects (\"patterns\") seem to be identified and perhaps ordered. In `train_1`, there's an orange pattern and a magenta pattern. In `train_2`, there's one composite pattern.\n    *   The azure objects (\"targets\") are also identified and ordered.\n    *   The replacement appears to map patterns to targets based on their respective orders. If there are more targets than patterns, the patterns are reused cyclically (as seen in `train_1`: pattern1 -> target1, pattern2 -> target2, pattern1 -> target3).\n    *   The placement of the replacement pattern uses the top-left corner of the bounding box of the target azure object as the anchor point for placing the top-left corner of the pattern object.\n7.  **Ordering:** The ordering for both patterns and targets seems to be based on their position in the grid, likely reading order (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right) based on their top-left coordinates.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
