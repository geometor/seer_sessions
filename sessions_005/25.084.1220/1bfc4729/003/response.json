Identify the two non-white pixels in the input grid. Record their colors and row/column coordinates.\n2. Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.\n3. Sort the two pixels based on their row index. Let P1 = (r1, c1, color1) be the pixel with the smaller row index, and P2 = (r2, c2, color2) be the pixel with the larger row index. If row indices are equal, the order doesn't strictly matter for the final output based on the drawing logic, but a consistent sort (e.g., by column next) is good practice.\n4. Create a new output grid of dimensions H x W, initially filled with white (0).\n5. Calculate the vertical midpoint row index: `mid_row = floor(H / 2)`.\n6. Draw the left vertical edge line (column 0): For each row `r` from 0 to H-1, set the color of cell (r, 0) to `color1` if `r < mid_row`, otherwise set it to `color2`.\n7. Draw the right vertical edge line (column W-1): For each row `r` from 0 to H-1, set the color of cell (r, W-1) to `color1` if `r < mid_row`, otherwise set it to `color2`.\n8. Draw the top horizontal edge line: Set all cells in row 0 to `color1`.\n9. Draw the bottom horizontal edge line: Set all cells in row H-1 to `color2`.\n10. Draw the horizontal line corresponding to P1: Set all cells in row `r1` to `color1`.\n11. Draw the horizontal line corresponding to P2: Set all cells in row `r2` to `color2`. (Note: This step ensures P2's color takes precedence if r1 == r2, consistent with P2 being the 'lower' pixel). The order of drawing horizontal lines after vertical lines ensures horizontal lines overwrite intersections correctly.\n12. The resulting grid is the final output.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n\ndef find_non_white_pixels(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds the coordinates and colors of non-white pixels.\"\"\"\n    pixels = []\n    for r, row in enumerate(grid):\n        for c, color in enumerate(row):\n            if color != 0:\n                pixels.append(((r, c), color))\n    return pixels\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on drawing horizontal and vertical edge lines,\n    and horizontal lines corresponding to the rows of the two non-white input pixels.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to numpy array\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n\n    # 1.
