            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code implemented a hypothesis based on drawing horizontal and vertical lines directly through the coordinates of the two non-white input pixels. The results clearly show this hypothesis is incorrect, as the generated output differs significantly from the expected output in terms of line placement and edge coloring.\n\nThe key errors in the previous approach were:\n1.  Incorrectly assuming vertical lines should be drawn at the *columns* of the input pixels.\n2.  Failing to account for the colored lines appearing at the *edges* of the output grid.\n3.  Not recognizing the rule for how colors are assigned to the edge lines, which appears related to the relative vertical positions of the input pixels.\n\nStrategy for resolving errors:\n1.  Re-analyze the relationship between the input pixels (position and color) and the structure of the output grid, paying close attention to the edges.\n2.  Formulate a new hypothesis incorporating the edge lines and the lines corresponding to the input pixel rows.\n3.  Define the logic for color assignment, especially for the vertical edge lines which seem to split based on the grid's vertical midpoint.\n4.  Refine the natural language program and prepare for coding the revised logic.\n\n## Metrics and Observations\n\nLet's gather metrics for each example to solidify the revised hypothesis.\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Input Grid: 10x10\n- Non-white Pixels:\n    - P_blue: (row=2, col=6, color=1)\n    - P_yellow: (row=7, col=5, color=4)\n- Sorted Pixels (by row):\n    - P1: (r1=2, c1=6, color1=1) (Blue)\n    - P2: (r2=7, c2=5, color2=4) (Yellow)\n- Output Grid: 10x10\n- Vertical Midpoint: floor(10/2) = 5. Rows 0-4 belong to the \"top\" half, rows 5-9 belong to the \"bottom\" half.\n- Output Lines:\n    - Horizontal full line at row r1=2 with color1=Blue.\n    - Horizontal full line at row r2=7 with color2=Yellow.\n    - Horizontal full line at top edge (row=0) with color1=Blue.\n    - Horizontal full line at bottom edge (row=9) with color2=Yellow.\n    - Vertical line at left edge (col=0): color1=Blue for rows 0-4, color2=Yellow for rows 5-9.\n    - Vertical line at right edge (col=9): color1=Blue for rows 0-4, color2=Yellow for rows 5-9.\n- Precedence: Horizontal lines overwrite vertical lines at all intersections (corners, r1/edges, r2/edges).\n\n**Example 2:**\n- Input Grid: 10x10\n- Non-white Pixels:\n    - P_magenta: (row=2, col=2, color=6)\n    - P_orange: (row=7, col=7, color=7)\n- Sorted Pixels (by row):\n    - P1: (r1=2, c1=2, color1=6) (Magenta)\n    - P2: (r2=7, c2=7, color2=7) (Orange)\n- Output Grid: 10x10\n- Vertical Midpoint: floor(10/2) = 5. Rows 0-4 belong to the \"top\" half, rows 5-9 belong to the \"bottom\" half.\n- Output Lines:\n    - Horizontal full line at row r1=2 with color1=Magenta.\n    - Horizontal full line at row r2=7 with color2=Orange.\n    - Horizontal full line at top edge (row=0) with color1=Magenta.\n    - Horizontal full line at bottom edge (row=9) with color2=Orange.\n    - Vertical line at left edge (col=0): color1=Magenta for rows 0-4, color2=Orange for rows 5-9.\n    - Vertical line at right edge (col=9): color1=Magenta for rows 0-4, color2=Orange for rows 5-9.\n- Precedence: Horizontal lines overwrite vertical lines at all intersections.\n\nThe metrics from both examples consistently support the revised hypothesis.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.\n3.  Sort the two pixels based on their row index. Let P1 = (r1, c1, color1) be the pixel with the smaller row index, and P2 = (r2, c2, color2) be the pixel with the larger row index.\n4.  Create a new output grid of dimensions H x W, initially filled with white (0).\n5.  Calculate the vertical midpoint row index: `mid_row = floor(H / 2)`.\n6.  Draw the left vertical edge line (column 0): For each row `r` from 0 to H-1, set the color of cell (r, 0) to `color1` if `r < mid_row`, otherwise set it to `color2`.\n7.  Draw the right vertical edge line (column W-1): For each row `r` from 0 to H-1, set the color of cell (r, W-1) to `color1` if `r < mid_row`, otherwise set it to `color2`.\n8.  Draw the top horizontal edge line: Set all cells in row 0 to `color1`.\n9.  Draw the bottom horizontal edge line: Set all cells in row H-1 to `color2`.\n10. Draw the horizontal line corresponding to P1: Set all cells in row `r1` to `color1`.\n11. Draw the horizontal line corresponding to P2: Set all cells in row `r2` to `color2`. (Note: If r1=r2, this line will overwrite the previous one with the color corresponding to P2, but since r1<=r2, P2's color would be the final one anyway if the sort was stable or P2 was chosen consistently in case of ties). The order ensures horizontal lines take precedence over vertical lines at intersections.\n12. The resulting grid is the final output."
