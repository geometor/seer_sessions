"""
Draw horizontal and vertical lines based on the position and color of two specific input pixels.
1. Identify the two non-white pixels in the input grid. Record their colors (C1, C2) and their row and column coordinates (row1, col1) and (row2, col2).
2. Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color white (0).
3. Draw a vertical line down the entire height of the output grid at column `col1` using color `C1`.
4. Draw a vertical line down the entire height of the output grid at column `col2` using color `C2`.
5. Draw a horizontal line across the entire width of the output grid at row `row1` using color `C1`. This line will overwrite any pixels already colored in that row, including intersections with vertical lines.
6. Draw a horizontal line across the entire width of the output grid at row `row2` using color `C2`. This line will overwrite any pixels already colored in that row, including intersections with vertical lines.
7. The resulting grid is the final output.
