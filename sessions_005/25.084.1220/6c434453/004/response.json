            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding of the task.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial code attempted to identify blue shapes enclosing single white holes, change the blue shape to white, and fill the hole with red. The results show this was incorrect. The transformed outputs failed to match the expected outputs, specifically in the colors assigned to the identified shapes and holes.\n\nThe core issue lies in the misinterpretation of the transformation rule based *only* on the first example (which was likely insufficient or misleading in isolation). The actual transformation appears more complex:\n\n1.  It correctly identifies blue shapes (color 1) that enclose exactly one white pixel (color 0).\n2.  Instead of just filling the hole, it creates a red '+' shape (color 2) centered on the original white pixel, encompassing the white pixel itself and its four orthogonal neighbors (which must have been part of the original blue shape).\n3.  The remaining pixels of the original blue shape (those not converted to red) are changed to white (color 0).\n4.  All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the natural language program to reflect this \"plus-sign\" transformation rule and ensure the corresponding code implementation correctly identifies the target shapes/holes and applies the precise color changes to the correct pixel locations.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nLet's examine the failing examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains two relevant blue shapes, each enclosing a single white pixel.\n        *   Shape 1 (Top-Right): 8 blue pixels around `(1, 5)`. Hole: `(1, 5)`.\n        *   Shape 2 (Bottom-Left): 8 blue pixels around `(6, 2)`. Hole: `(6, 2)`.\n    *   **Expected Output:**\n        *   Shape 1 Area: Red '+' at `(0,5), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,5)`. Remaining 4 blue pixels changed to white.\n        *   Shape 2 Area: Red '+' at `(5,2), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,2)`. Remaining 4 blue pixels changed to white.\n    *   **Transformed Output:** Only the original holes `(1, 5)` and `(6, 2)` were changed to red. Some blue pixels were changed to white, but not in the correct pattern (8 pixels changed to white in total, matching the count, but incorrect locations).\n    *   **Discrepancy:** The code failed to create the red '+' shape and incorrectly applied the white color change. Pixels Off: 8 (6 red pixels missing, 2 red pixels where white should be, 4 white pixels where red should be, 4 white pixels in correct locations but shifted).\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains two relevant blue shapes, each enclosing a single white pixel.\n        *   Shape 1 (Top-Left): 8 blue pixels around `(1, 1)`. Hole: `(1, 1)`.\n        *   Shape 2 (Bottom-Middle): 8 blue pixels around `(7, 4)`. Hole: `(7, 4)`.\n    *   **Expected Output:**\n        *   Shape 1 Area: Red '+' at `(0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1)`. Remaining 4 blue pixels changed to white.\n        *   Shape 2 Area: Red '+' at `(6,4), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,4)`. Remaining 4 blue pixels changed to white.\n    *   **Transformed Output:** Only the original holes `(1, 1)` and `(7, 4)` were changed to red. Some blue pixels were changed to white, again matching the count (8) but incorrect locations.\n    *   **Discrepancy:** Same failure pattern as Example 1. Pixels Off: 8.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
