task_description: Identify blue shapes that enclose exactly one contiguous white area (hole), then modify both the shape and the hole.

definitions:
  - object: blue_shape
    definition: A contiguous block of pixels with color blue (1). Connectivity is 4-directional (up, down, left, right).
  - object: white_area
    definition: A contiguous block of pixels with color white (0). Connectivity is 4-directional.
  - property: hole
    definition: A white_area that does not touch the grid boundary and whose immediate neighboring pixels (4-directional) are *all* blue (1) and belong to the *same* single blue_shape.
  - property: target_shape
    definition: A blue_shape that encloses exactly one hole.

transformation:
  - action: find_objects
    parameters:
      color: blue (1)
      connectivity: 4
    output: list_of_blue_shapes
  - action: find_objects
    parameters:
      color: white (0)
      connectivity: 4
    output: list_of_white_areas
  - action: identify_holes
    input: list_of_white_areas, list_of_blue_shapes, grid_dimensions
    output: map_blue_shape_to_holes # A mapping where keys are blue_shapes and values are lists of holes they enclose.
    criteria:
      - for each white_area:
        - check: does not touch boundary
        - check: all neighbors are blue
        - check: all blue neighbors belong to the same single blue_shape
  - action: identify_target_shapes
    input: map_blue_shape_to_holes
    output: list_of_target_shapes
    criteria:
      - for each blue_shape in map:
        - check: number of associated holes == 1
  - action: apply_color_change
    input: list_of_target_shapes, original_grid
    output: modified_grid
    steps:
      - initialize modified_grid as a copy of original_grid
      - for each target_shape in list_of_target_shapes:
        - get the coordinates of the blue pixels of the target_shape
        - get the coordinates of the single hole enclosed by the target_shape
        - update modified_grid: change color of blue pixels to white (0)
        - update modified_grid: change color of hole pixels to red (2)

output_grid: The final modified_grid after processing all target_shapes. Other pixels retain their original color from the input grid.
