**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input grids in all examples are uniformly filled with the color white (0). The output grids retain the same dimensions as their corresponding inputs but are filled with a specific pattern using blue (1) and white (0) pixels.

Observing the output grids:
- Rows with even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are entirely filled with blue (1).
- Rows with odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) consist of alternating blue (1) and white (0) pixels, starting with blue (1) in the column with index 0.

This pattern is consistent across all training examples, regardless of the grid size. The transformation rule depends solely on the row and column indices of each pixel within the grid.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_size_relation: output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  input_grid_properties:
    - uniform_color: white (0)
  output_grid_properties:
    - colors_present: [blue (1), white (0)]
    - pattern_type: row and column dependent

transformation_details:
  rule_based_on_indices: The color of a pixel in the output grid is determined by its row (r) and column (c) index.
  conditions:
    - condition_1:
        predicate: row index `r` is even (r % 2 == 0)
        action: set pixel color to blue (1)
    - condition_2:
        predicate: row index `r` is odd (r % 2 != 0)
        sub_conditions:
          - condition_2a:
              predicate: column index `c` is even (c % 2 == 0)
              action: set pixel color to blue (1)
          - condition_2b:
              predicate: column index `c` is odd (c % 2 != 0)
              action: set pixel color to white (0)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid with the same height and width as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell of the new grid using its row index `r` and column index `c`, starting from index 0.
3.  For each cell at `(r, c)`:
    a.  If the row index `r` is an even number, set the cell's color to blue (1).
    b.  If the row index `r` is an odd number:
        i.  If the column index `c` is an even number, set the cell's color to blue (1).
        ii. If the column index `c` is an odd number, set the cell's color to white (0).
4.  The resulting grid is the output.
