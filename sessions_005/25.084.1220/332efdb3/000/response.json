The output grids retain the same dimensions as their corresponding inputs but are filled with a specific pattern using blue (1) and white (0) pixels.\n\nObserving the output grids:\n- Rows with even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are entirely filled with blue (1).\n- Rows with odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) consist of alternating blue (1) and white (0) pixels, starting with blue (1) in the column with index 0.\n\nThis pattern is consistent across all training examples, regardless of the grid size. The transformation rule depends solely on the row and column indices of each pixel within the grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
