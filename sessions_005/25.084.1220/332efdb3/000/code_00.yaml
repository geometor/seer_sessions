task_context:
  grid_size_relation: output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  input_grid_properties:
    - uniform_color: white (0)
  output_grid_properties:
    - colors_present: [blue (1), white (0)]
    - pattern_type: row and column dependent

transformation_details:
  rule_based_on_indices: The color of a pixel in the output grid is determined by its row (r) and column (c) index.
  conditions:
    - condition_1:
        predicate: row index `r` is even (r % 2 == 0)
        action: set pixel color to blue (1)
    - condition_2:
        predicate: row index `r` is odd (r % 2 != 0)
        sub_conditions:
          - condition_2a:
              predicate: column index `c` is even (c % 2 == 0)
              action: set pixel color to blue (1)
          - condition_2b:
              predicate: column index `c` is odd (c % 2 != 0)
              action: set pixel color to white (0)
