"""
Identifies 3x3 areas in the input grid, potentially separated by vertical gray columns or horizontal gray rows. 
For each 3x3 area, it finds the color of the central pixel in the middle row (relative coordinates 1,1).
If this central input color is blue(1), red(2), green(3), or yellow(4), it maps this color to a corresponding output color (magenta(6), orange(7), azure(8), or maroon(9) respectively).
The entire 3x3 area in the output grid corresponding to the input area is then filled with this mapped output color.
Gray delimiters (columns or rows) are preserved in their original positions in the output grid.
