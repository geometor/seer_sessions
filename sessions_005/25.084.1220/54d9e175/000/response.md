*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids consistently feature vertical gray (5) lines acting as delimiters.
    *   These gray lines define sections within the grid, typically creating 3x3 areas separated by the gray columns.
    *   Within these 3x3 areas, the top and bottom rows are always white (0). The middle row contains a single non-white pixel at the central position (relative to the 3x3 area).
    *   The specific color of this central pixel in the input varies across examples (blue, red, green, yellow).
    *   The output grids maintain the same dimensions and the gray delimiters as the input.
    *   The key transformation occurs within the 3x3 areas: the entire 3x3 area in the output is filled with a single color.
    *   The output color is determined by the color of the single non-white pixel in the corresponding input area.
    *   There appears to be a fixed mapping between the input pixel color and the output fill color.
    *   Example 3 shows that this pattern can be applied independently to multiple sets of 3x3 areas separated by a full row of gray pixels.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    2.  Copy any vertical columns or horizontal rows consisting entirely of gray (5) pixels from the input grid to the corresponding positions in the output grid.
    3.  Identify all 3x3 areas in the input grid that are bounded by these gray delimiters or the grid edges.
    4.  For each identified 3x3 input area:
        a.  Find the pixel located at the relative coordinates (1, 1) (middle row, middle column) within that 3x3 area.
        b.  Determine the color of this central pixel.
        c.  Apply the following color mapping to find the output fill color:
            *   If the input color is blue (1), the output color is magenta (6).
            *   If the input color is red (2), the output color is orange (7).
            *   If the input color is green (3), the output color is azure (8).
            *   If the input color is yellow (4), the output color is maroon (9).
            *   (Implicitly, if the input color is white (0) or gray (5), the area might remain unchanged or be handled by the initial copy step, but the examples focus on non-white/gray trigger pixels).
        d.  Fill the entire corresponding 3x3 area in the output grid with the determined output fill color.
    5.  Return the completed output grid.
