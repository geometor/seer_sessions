Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels.
2.  **Transformation Goal:** The task transforms a smaller input grid into a larger output grid.
3.  **Key Observation:** Each pixel in the input grid is "scaled up" or "expanded" into a square block of pixels of the same color in the output grid.
4.  **Scaling Factor:** The size of the output grid and the size of the expanded blocks depend on a factor derived from the input grid. In example 1 (3x3 -> 9x9), the factor is 3. In example 2 (3x3 -> 6x6), the factor is 2. In example 3 (3x3 -> 15x15), the factor is 5.
5.  **Factor Determination:** Observing the examples, the scaling factor (3, 2, 5) directly corresponds to the *number of non-white (non-zero) pixels* present in the respective input grids (3 non-zero pixels in input 1, 2 in input 2, 5 in input 3).
6.  **Mapping:** If the input grid has dimensions H x W and the scaling factor is F, the output grid has dimensions (H * F) x (W * F). A pixel at `(r, c)` in the input with color `C` corresponds to an F x F block of color `C` in the output, starting at position `(r * F, c * F)`.

```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
transformation_name: pixel_scaling_by_count
input_characteristics:
  - grid_type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
  - grid_size: variable (e.g., 3x3 in examples)
  - elements: pixels represented by colors (0=white, 1-9=other colors)
output_characteristics:
  - grid_type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
  - grid_size: larger than input, specifically (input_height * F) x (input_width * F) where F is the scaling factor.
  - elements: pixels represented by colors.
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color (integer 0-9)
      - position (row, column)
  - type: block (in output)
    properties:
      - color (integer 0-9)
      - size (F x F, where F is the scaling factor)
      - position (top-left corner row, top-left corner column)
actions:
  - name: count_non_zero_pixels
    input: input_grid
    output: scaling_factor (integer F)
  - name: calculate_output_dimensions
    input: input_grid_dimensions (H, W), scaling_factor (F)
    output: output_grid_dimensions (H*F, W*F)
  - name: create_output_grid
    input: output_grid_dimensions
    output: empty_output_grid (e.g., filled with white/0)
  - name: map_and_fill
    input: input_pixel_color (C), input_pixel_position (r, c), scaling_factor (F), output_grid
    process: fills an F x F block in the output_grid starting at (r*F, c*F) with color C.
relationships:
  - each input pixel at (r, c) maps to a block in the output grid.
  - the top-left corner of the output block is determined by the input pixel's position (r, c) and the scaling factor F: (r * F, c * F).
  - the size of the output block (F x F) is determined by the scaling factor F.
  - the color of the output block is identical to the color of the corresponding input pixel.
  - the scaling factor F is determined by the total count of non-zero pixels in the entire input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Analyze Input:** Examine the input grid.
2.  **Determine Scaling Factor:** Count the total number of pixels in the input grid that have a color value other than white (0). This count is the scaling factor, let's call it `F`.
3.  **Calculate Output Size:** Get the height `H` and width `W` of the input grid. The output grid will have dimensions (`H` * `F`) by (`W` * `F`).
4.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an output grid with the calculated dimensions, filling it entirely with the white (0) color.
5.  **Scale and Place Pixels:** Iterate through each pixel of the input grid, identified by its row `r` (from 0 to `H`-1) and column `c` (from 0 to `W`-1).
    a.  Get the color `C` of the input pixel at `(r, c)`.
    b.  Calculate the starting position for the block in the output grid: `output_row = r * F`, `output_col = c * F`.
    c.  Fill a square block of size `F` x `F` in the output grid, starting at `(output_row, output_col)`, with the color `C`. This involves setting the color of all pixels from `(output_row, output_col)` up to `(output_row + F - 1, output_col + F - 1)` to `C`.
6.  **Final Output:** The fully populated output grid is the result.
