            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels.\n2.  **Transformation Goal:** The task transforms a smaller input grid into a larger output grid.\n3.  **Key Observation:** Each pixel in the input grid is \"scaled up\" or \"expanded\" into a square block of pixels of the same color in the output grid.\n4.  **Scaling Factor:** The size of the output grid and the size of the expanded blocks depend on a factor derived from the input grid. In example 1 (3x3 -> 9x9), the factor is 3. In example 2 (3x3 -> 6x6), the factor is 2. In example 3 (3x3 -> 15x15), the factor is 5.\n5.  **Factor Determination:** Observing the examples, the scaling factor (3, 2, 5) directly corresponds to the *number of non-white (non-zero) pixels* present in the respective input grids (3 non-zero pixels in input 1, 2 in input 2, 5 in input 3).\n6.  **Mapping:** If the input grid has dimensions H x W and the scaling factor is F, the output grid has dimensions (H * F) x (W * F). A pixel at `(r, c)` in the input with color `C` corresponds to an F x F block of color `C` in the output, starting at position `(r * F, c * F)`.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

The output grid will have dimensions (`H` * `F`) by (`W` * `F`).\n4.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an output grid with the calculated dimensions, filling it entirely with the white (0) color.\n5.  **Scale and Place Pixels:** Iterate through each pixel of the input grid, identified by its row `r` (from 0 to `H`-1) and column `c` (from 0 to `W`-1).\n    a.

Fill a square block of size `F` x `F` in the output grid, starting at `(output_row, output_col)`, with the color `C`.
