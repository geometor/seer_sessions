task_description: Transform the grid based on the position of a single non-white source pixel.

elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with values 0-9 representing colors. Contains a background and usually one distinct object.
    properties:
      - height: Integer (1-30)
      - width: Integer (1-30)
      - background_color: white (0)

  - object: source_pixel
    description: The single non-white pixel in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: Integer (1-9), varies per example (magenta, red, maroon).
      - initial_location: Tuple (row_s, col_s)
      - column_parity: String ('even' or 'odd') derived from col_s.
      - final_location: Tuple (row_s + 1, col_s)

  - object: yellow_pattern
    description: A pattern of yellow pixels introduced in the output grid.
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - location: Cells (r, c) where 0 <= r <= row_s, and the parity of c matches the column_parity of the source_pixel.

actions:
  - action: identify_source_pixel
    input: input_grid
    output: source_pixel_properties (color, initial_location, column_parity)
    description: Find the coordinates and color of the unique non-white pixel. Determine the parity of its column.

  - action: generate_yellow_pattern
    input: grid_dimensions, source_pixel_initial_row (row_s), source_pixel_column_parity
    output: partial_output_grid (containing only the yellow pattern on a white background)
    description: Create a grid filled with yellow (4) at cells (r, c) where r is between 0 and row_s (inclusive) and the parity of column c matches the source_pixel_column_parity.

  - action: move_source_pixel
    input: source_pixel_color, source_pixel_initial_location (row_s, col_s)
    output: source_pixel_final_location (row_s + 1, col_s)
    description: Calculate the new position for the source pixel, one row below its original position.

  - action: construct_output_grid
    input: partial_output_grid (from generate_yellow_pattern), source_pixel_color, source_pixel_final_location
    output: final_output_grid
    description: Start with the grid containing the yellow pattern. Place the source_pixel_color at the source_pixel_final_location. Ensure the final grid has the correct dimensions. Handle cases where the final location might be outside the grid boundaries (though not observed in examples, typically implies the pixel is not placed).

relationships:
  - The yellow pattern's vertical extent (rows 0 to row_s) is determined by the source_pixel's initial row.
  - The yellow pattern's horizontal placement (columns included) is determined by the parity of the source_pixel's initial column.
  - The source_pixel's final location is directly derived from its initial location (shifted down by one row).
  - The final output combines the generated yellow pattern and the moved source pixel.
