            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid contains a single non-white pixel (the \"source pixel\") on a white background. The grids vary in size.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. It contains the original source pixel, but moved one position down. It also features a new pattern of yellow pixels.\n3.  **Source Pixel Movement:** The single non-white pixel from the input grid is found one row lower in the output grid, while maintaining its original column.\n4.  **Yellow Pattern Generation:** A pattern of yellow pixels appears in the output grid. This pattern extends from the top row (row 0) down to and including the *original* row of the source pixel.\n5.  **Column Parity Rule:** The columns containing the yellow pixels depend on the column of the *original* source pixel. If the source pixel was in an even column (0, 2, 4,...), the yellow pixels appear in all even columns within the specified rows. If the source pixel was in an odd column (1, 3, 5,...), the yellow pixels appear in all odd columns within the specified rows.\n6.  **Overlap:** The yellow pattern fills the designated cells. The moved source pixel is then placed, potentially overwriting a yellow cell if its new position `(original_row + 1, original_col)` happens to fall within the yellow pattern's area (although this doesn't occur in the examples as the source always moves *below* the yellow pattern's maximum row). The yellow pattern generation itself *does* overwrite the original position of the source pixel if it matches the row/column parity criteria.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Record its color (`source_color`), row (`row_s`), and column (`col_s`).\n2.  **Determine Column Parity:** Check if `col_s` is even or odd.\n3.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).\n4.  **Generate Yellow Pattern:** Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the grid. If the row `r` is less than or equal to `row_s` AND the parity (even/odd) of the column `c` matches the parity of `col_s`, set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to yellow (4).\n5.  **Place Moved Source Pixel:** Calculate the new row `new_row_s = row_s + 1`. If `new_row_s` is within the grid boundaries (i.e., `new_row_s < grid_height`), set the pixel at `(new_row_s, col_s)` in the output grid to `source_color`. This step overwrites any pixel previously placed at this location by the yellow pattern generation (though practically, the source pixel always moves below the generated pattern in the examples).\n6.  **Return Output:** The modified grid is the final output."
