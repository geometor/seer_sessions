            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels. The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged between input and output for each example.\n2.  **Background Color:** There's a consistent background color, orange (7), which remains unchanged in the output grid.\n3.  **Foreground Pixels:** In the input grids, there are specific pixels with colors other than orange (7). These colors include maroon (9), magenta (6), yellow (4), and blue (1).\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation exclusively affects these non-background pixels. Their positions remain the same, but their colors change.\n5.  **Output Colors:** The non-background pixels in the output grid consistently take on one of three colors: red (2), azure (8), or gray (5).\n6.  **Pattern:** The specific output color assigned to a pixel seems to depend on the order in which the non-background pixels are encountered when scanning the grid (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) and potentially on the total number of non-background pixels in the input.\n7.  **Cycling Behavior:** The output colors (2, 8, 5) appear to be assigned in a repeating cycle. However, the specific order of the cycle differs between examples.\n    *   In Train 1 (6 non-background pixels), the output sequence is (2, 8, 5, 2, 8, 5). This follows a cycle of (2, 8, 5).\n    *   In Train 2 (7 non-background pixels), the output sequence is (2, 8, 5, 2, 8, 5, 2). This also follows a cycle of (2, 8, 5).\n    *   In Train 3 (9 non-background pixels), the output sequence is (2, 5, 8, 2, 5, 8, 2, 5, 8). This follows a cycle of (2, 5, 8).\n8.  **Cycle Determinant:** The choice between the cycle (2, 8, 5) and (2, 5, 8) appears to depend on the total count (`N`) of non-background pixels in the input grid. If N is 6 or 7, the cycle (2, 8, 5) is used. If N is 9, the cycle (2, 5, 8) is used.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
