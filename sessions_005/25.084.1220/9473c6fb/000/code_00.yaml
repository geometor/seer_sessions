task_description: Replace non-background pixels with colors from a repeating 3-color cycle, determined by the total count of non-background pixels.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: 7 (orange)
  - dimensions_preserved: true
objects:
  - type: background_pixel
    color: 7 (orange)
    behavior: remains unchanged
  - type: foreground_pixel
    color: any color except 7 (orange)
    behavior: color is replaced based on a rule
transformation_rule:
  - step: Identify all foreground pixels (color != 7).
  - step: Count the total number (`N`) of foreground pixels.
  - step: Select a 3-color cycle based on `N`:
      - if N is 6 or 7: cycle = [2 (red), 8 (azure), 5 (gray)]
      - if N is 9: cycle = [2 (red), 5 (gray), 8 (azure)]
      # Note: General rule for other N values is unclear from examples.
  - step: Create a copy of the input grid for the output.
  - step: Initialize a counter for foreground pixels found (`count = 0`).
  - step: Iterate through the input grid cells (row by row, column by column).
  - step: For each cell:
      - if the cell is a foreground pixel:
          - increment `count`.
          - determine the cycle index: `index = (count - 1) % 3`.
          - get the target color from the selected cycle: `target_color = cycle[index]`.
          - update the corresponding cell in the output grid with `target_color`.
      - if the cell is a background pixel:
          - keep the background color in the output grid.
