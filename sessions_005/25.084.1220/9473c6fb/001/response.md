Replace non-background pixels (color != 7) with colors from a repeating 3-color cycle. 
The specific cycle used depends on the total count (N) of non-background pixels:
- If N is 6 or 7, the cycle is [2 (red), 8 (azure), 5 (gray)].
- If N is 9, the cycle is [2 (red), 5 (gray), 8 (azure)].
The replacement occurs in the order the non-background pixels are encountered when scanning the grid row by row, left to right.
