task_description: Replace gray pixels in specific columns based on a ranking derived from gray pixel counts.

grid_properties:
  - size: Variable height and width (observed 9x9 in examples).
  - colors: White (0), Blue (1), Red (2), Green (3), Yellow (4), Gray (5). Other colors may exist but are not relevant to the core transformation.

objects:
  - object: column
    definition: A vertical slice of the grid.
  - object: gray_pixel_column
    definition: A column containing at least one gray (5) pixel.
    properties:
      - index: The 0-based column index.
      - gray_count: The number of gray (5) pixels within the column.
      - rank: An integer from 1 to N (where N is the number of gray_pixel_columns, observed N=4) determined by sorting.
      - replacement_color: The color (Yellow(4), Green(3), Red(2), or Blue(1)) assigned based on the rank.

actions:
  - action: identify_gray_columns
    description: Find all columns in the input grid that contain one or more gray (5) pixels and count the number of gray pixels in each.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list_of_gray_columns (each with index and gray_count)
  - action: rank_gray_columns
    description: >
      Sort the identified gray_pixel_columns to determine their rank.
      The primary sorting key is `gray_count` in ascending order.
      The secondary sorting key (for tie-breaking) is `index` in ascending order.
      Assign ranks 1, 2, 3, 4 based on the sorted order.
    inputs: list_of_gray_columns
    outputs: ranked_list_of_gray_columns
  - action: assign_colors
    description: >
      Determine the replacement color for each ranked column based on its rank:
      Rank 1 -> Yellow (4)
      Rank 2 -> Green (3)
      Rank 3 -> Red (2)
      Rank 4 -> Blue (1)
    inputs: ranked_list_of_gray_columns
    outputs: ranked_list_of_gray_columns_with_colors
  - action: replace_pixels
    description: >
      Create a copy of the input grid. For each ranked gray_pixel_column,
      iterate through its pixels. If a pixel in the original input grid at that
      column's index was gray (5), change its color in the copied grid to the
      `replacement_color` assigned to that column's rank. Leave all other pixels unchanged.
    inputs: input_grid, ranked_list_of_gray_columns_with_colors
    outputs: output_grid
