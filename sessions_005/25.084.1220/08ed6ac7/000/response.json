            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output grids are the same size (9x9 in the examples).\n2.  **Color Palette:** The input uses white (0) and gray (5). The output uses white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the gray (5) pixels. White (0) pixels remain unchanged.\n4.  **Objects:** The gray pixels form distinct vertical segments within specific columns. It appears we should consider each *column* containing gray pixels as a distinct object to analyze.\n5.  **Color Assignment Logic:** All gray pixels within a single original column are replaced by the *same* new color (1, 2, 3, or 4). The specific color assigned to a column depends on some property of that column relative to the other columns containing gray pixels.\n6.  **Property Identification:** The number of gray pixels within each relevant column seems crucial.\n7.  **Ranking and Mapping:** The examples suggest a ranking system. Columns are ranked based on their count of gray pixels. A specific tie-breaking rule (using column index) seems necessary. This rank is then mapped to a specific output color (1, 2, 3, or 4). The mapping appears fixed: the column with the lowest count rank gets yellow (4), the next rank gets blue (1), the next gets green (3), and the highest rank gets red (2).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify all columns in the input grid that contain at least one gray (5) pixel. Store these columns along with their column indices.\n3.  For each identified column, calculate the total count of gray (5) pixels within it.\n4.  Create a list of objects, where each object represents an identified column and stores its index and its gray pixel count.\n5.  Sort this list of column objects. The primary sorting criterion is the gray pixel count in ascending order (smallest count first). The secondary sorting criterion, used only for tie-breaking when counts are equal, is the column index in descending order (higher index first).\n6.  Iterate through the sorted list of column objects, assigning ranks 1, 2, 3, 4 based on their position in the sorted list (the first object gets rank 1, the second gets rank 2, etc.).\n7.  Determine the target replacement color for each column based on its rank using the following fixed mapping:\n    *   Rank 1 maps to Yellow (4).\n    *   Rank 2 maps to Blue (1).\n    *   Rank 3 maps to Green (3).\n    *   Rank 4 maps to Red (2).\n8.  For each identified column in the output grid, iterate through its pixels. If a pixel in the input grid at that position was gray (5), change its color in the output grid to the target replacement color determined for that column in the previous step.\n9.  Return the modified output grid."
