Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output grids are the same size (9x9 in the examples).
2.  **Color Palette:** The input uses white (0) and gray (5). The output uses white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4).
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the gray (5) pixels. White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
4.  **Objects:** The gray pixels form distinct vertical segments within specific columns. It appears we should consider each *column* containing gray pixels as a distinct object to analyze.
5.  **Color Assignment Logic:** All gray pixels within a single original column are replaced by the *same* new color (1, 2, 3, or 4). The specific color assigned to a column depends on some property of that column relative to the other columns containing gray pixels.
6.  **Property Identification:** The number of gray pixels within each relevant column seems crucial.
7.  **Ranking and Mapping:** The examples suggest a ranking system. Columns are ranked based on their count of gray pixels. A specific tie-breaking rule (using column index) seems necessary. This rank is then mapped to a specific output color (1, 2, 3, or 4). The mapping appears fixed: the column with the lowest count rank gets yellow (4), the next rank gets blue (1), the next gets green (3), and the highest rank gets red (2).

## Facts


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors.
    properties:
      - dimensions: height and width (e.g., 9x9)
      - pixels: cells containing color values (0-9)

  - object: gray_column
    description: A column in the input grid that contains one or more gray (5) pixels. These often form contiguous vertical segments.
    properties:
      - column_index: The 0-based index of the column.
      - gray_pixel_count: The total number of gray (5) pixels in that column.
      - rank: A numerical rank assigned based on gray_pixel_count and column_index.

  - relationship: ranking_criteria
    description: Columns containing gray pixels are ranked relative to each other.
    criteria:
      - primary_sort_key: gray_pixel_count (ascending).
      - secondary_sort_key (tie-breaker): column_index (descending - higher index gets lower rank).

  - relationship: rank_to_color_mapping
    description: A fixed mapping assigns an output color based on the calculated rank of the gray_column.
    mapping:
      - Rank 1: Yellow (4)
      - Rank 2: Blue (1)
      - Rank 3: Green (3)
      - Rank 4: Red (2)
    assumption: There are always exactly four gray_columns, corresponding to ranks 1 through 4.

  - action: identify_gray_columns
    description: Scan the input grid to find all columns containing at least one gray (5) pixel.

  - action: count_gray_pixels
    description: For each identified gray_column, count the number of gray (5) pixels within it.

  - action: rank_columns
    description: Sort the identified gray_columns according to the ranking_criteria to determine their rank (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th).

  - action: assign_color
    description: Assign an output color (1, 2, 3, or 4) to each gray_column based on its rank using the rank_to_color_mapping.

  - action: replace_pixels
    description: Create the output grid by copying the input grid, then replacing all gray (5) pixels in each gray_column with the color assigned to that column.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all columns in the input grid that contain at least one gray (5) pixel. Store these columns along with their column indices.
3.  For each identified column, calculate the total count of gray (5) pixels within it.
4.  Create a list of objects, where each object represents an identified column and stores its index and its gray pixel count.
5.  Sort this list of column objects. The primary sorting criterion is the gray pixel count in ascending order (smallest count first). The secondary sorting criterion, used only for tie-breaking when counts are equal, is the column index in descending order (higher index first).
6.  Iterate through the sorted list of column objects, assigning ranks 1, 2, 3, 4 based on their position in the sorted list (the first object gets rank 1, the second gets rank 2, etc.).
7.  Determine the target replacement color for each column based on its rank using the following fixed mapping:
    *   Rank 1 maps to Yellow (4).
    *   Rank 2 maps to Blue (1).
    *   Rank 3 maps to Green (3).
    *   Rank 4 maps to Red (2).
8.  For each identified column in the output grid, iterate through its pixels. If a pixel in the input grid at that position was gray (5), change its color in the output grid to the target replacement color determined for that column in the previous step.
9.  Return the modified output grid.
