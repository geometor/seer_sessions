facts:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors.
    properties:
      - dimensions: height and width (e.g., 9x9)
      - pixels: cells containing color values (0-9)

  - object: gray_column
    description: A column in the input grid that contains one or more gray (5) pixels. These often form contiguous vertical segments.
    properties:
      - column_index: The 0-based index of the column.
      - gray_pixel_count: The total number of gray (5) pixels in that column.
      - rank: A numerical rank assigned based on gray_pixel_count and column_index.

  - relationship: ranking_criteria
    description: Columns containing gray pixels are ranked relative to each other.
    criteria:
      - primary_sort_key: gray_pixel_count (ascending).
      - secondary_sort_key (tie-breaker): column_index (descending - higher index gets lower rank).

  - relationship: rank_to_color_mapping
    description: A fixed mapping assigns an output color based on the calculated rank of the gray_column.
    mapping:
      - Rank 1: Yellow (4)
      - Rank 2: Blue (1)
      - Rank 3: Green (3)
      - Rank 4: Red (2)
    assumption: There are always exactly four gray_columns, corresponding to ranks 1 through 4.

  - action: identify_gray_columns
    description: Scan the input grid to find all columns containing at least one gray (5) pixel.

  - action: count_gray_pixels
    description: For each identified gray_column, count the number of gray (5) pixels within it.

  - action: rank_columns
    description: Sort the identified gray_columns according to the ranking_criteria to determine their rank (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th).

  - action: assign_color
    description: Assign an output color (1, 2, 3, or 4) to each gray_column based on its rank using the rank_to_color_mapping.

  - action: replace_pixels
    description: Create the output grid by copying the input grid, then replacing all gray (5) pixels in each gray_column with the color assigned to that column.
