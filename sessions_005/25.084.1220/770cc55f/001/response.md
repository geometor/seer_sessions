"""
Identifies a horizontal red line (color 2) separating the grid.
Finds a colored shape above the red line and another shape of the same color below it.
Calculates the intersection of the column indices occupied by these two shapes.
Determines a vertical region (either between the top shape and the red line, or between the red line and the bottom shape) based on whether the intersection columns match the columns of the top shape, the bottom shape, or neither (proper subset).
Fills the determined vertical region within the intersection columns with yellow (color 4).

Specifically:
1. Find the row index of the red line.
2. Find the properties (max row, column set) of the shape above the red line.
3. Find the properties (min row, column set) of the shape below the red line.
4. Calculate the intersection of the top and bottom column sets.
5. If the intersection columns match the bottom shape's columns, fill rows between the top shape's max row and the red line row.
6. Else if the intersection columns match the top shape's columns, fill rows between the red line row and the bottom shape's min row.
7. Else (intersection is a proper subset of both), fill rows between the top shape's max row and the red line row.
8. Fill only within the intersection columns, using color 4 (yellow).
