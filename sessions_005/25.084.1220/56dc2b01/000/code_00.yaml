task_elements:
  - object:
      name: green_shape
      color: 3 (green)
      properties:
        - contiguous
        - variable shape
        - mobile
  - object:
      name: red_barrier
      color: 2 (red)
      properties:
        - contiguous
        - shape: straight line (horizontal or vertical)
        - stationary
        - acts as a movement boundary
  - object:
      name: azure_marker
      color: 8 (azure)
      properties:
        - shape: straight line (horizontal or vertical)
        - appears only in output
        - position depends on green_shape movement and red_barrier orientation
        - extent matches red_barrier extent (width or height)
  - background_color: 0 (white)

actions:
  - action: move
    actor: green_shape
    direction: towards red_barrier (up, down, left, or right)
    termination_condition: bounding box of green_shape is 1 pixel adjacent to bounding box of red_barrier
  - action: create
    object: azure_marker
    location_rule:
      - condition: red_barrier is horizontal
        position:
          - if green_shape moved down: 1 row above final green_shape top edge
          - if green_shape moved up: 1 row below final green_shape bottom edge
        orientation: horizontal
        extent: matches column span of red_barrier
      - condition: red_barrier is vertical
        position:
          - if green_shape moved right: column at (original_green_shape_right_edge + final_green_shape_left_edge) // 2
          # - if green_shape moved left: column at (original_green_shape_left_edge + final_green_shape_right_edge) // 2 # Hypothetical
        orientation: vertical
        extent: matches row span of red_barrier
  - action: clear
    location: original position of green_shape
    result: pixels set to background_color (0)

relationships:
  - green_shape moves relative to red_barrier.
  - final position of green_shape is adjacent (1 pixel gap) to red_barrier.
  - azure_marker position is determined by the final position of green_shape, its original position, and the orientation/extent of red_barrier.
