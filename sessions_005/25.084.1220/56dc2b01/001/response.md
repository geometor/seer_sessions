Transformation Rule Description:

1. Identify the green object (color 3) and the red line object (color 2) in the input grid.
2. Determine the bounding boxes of both objects.
3. Determine the orientation of the red line (horizontal or vertical).
4. Calculate the direction the green object must move (up, down, left, or right) to approach the red line.
5. Calculate the target position for the green object such that its bounding box edge is
