            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions (10x10 in the examples).\n2.  **Colors:** The input grids contain only white (0) and blue (1) pixels. The output grids contain white (0), blue (1), red (2), orange (7), magenta (6), and azure (8) pixels.\n3.  **Persistence:** The blue (1) pixels from the input grid remain in the same positions in the output grid.\n4.  **Transformation:** New colored pixels (red, orange, magenta, azure) appear in the output grid. Their positions are relative to the positions of the blue (1) pixels in the input.\n5.  **Pattern:** Around each blue pixel at location `(r, c)`, a specific pattern of four colored pixels is placed, provided the target location is within the grid boundaries and is currently white (0). The pattern is:\n    *   Red (2) at `(r-1, c)` (one step above)\n    *   Orange (7) at `(r, c-1)` (one step left)\n    *   Magenta (6) at `(r, c+1)` (one step right)\n    *   Azure (8) at `(r+1, c)` (one step below)\n6.  **Boundary Handling:** If a part of the pattern falls outside the grid dimensions, that part is simply omitted.\n7.  **Overlap Handling:** Based on the examples, it appears that pattern pixels are only placed onto cells that are initially white (0) in the input grid (or equivalently, white in the output grid before placing the pattern for the current blue pixel). This prevents overwriting existing blue pixels or parts of patterns generated by other blue pixels.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
