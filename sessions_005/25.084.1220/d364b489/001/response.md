"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rule:
1. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2. Find all blue pixels (color 1) in the input grid.
3. For each blue pixel at coordinate (r, c):
   - Define a pattern with four colored pixels and their relative positions:
     - Red (2) at (-1, 0) [above]
     - Orange (7) at (0, -1) [left]
     - Magenta (6) at (0, +1) [right]
     - Azure (8) at (+1, 0) [below]
   - For each element in the pattern (relative position (dr, dc) and color):
     - Calculate the target absolute coordinate (tr, tc) = (r + dr, c + dc).
     - Check if (tr, tc) is within the grid boundaries.
     - Check if the pixel at (tr, tc) in the *current* output grid is white (0).
     - If both conditions are true, set the pixel at (tr, tc) in the output grid to the pattern color.
4. Return the final modified output grid.
