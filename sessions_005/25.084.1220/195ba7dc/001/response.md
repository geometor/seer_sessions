1.  Identify the vertical red line (color 2) in the input grid. This line acts as a separator.
2.  Define the "left grid" as the portion of the input grid to the left of the red line (columns 0-5).
3.  Define the "right grid" as the portion of the input grid to the right of the red line (columns 7-12).
4.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the left grid (5x6).
5.  For each cell position `(row, column)` within the dimensions of the output grid:
    a.  Examine the color of the cell at `(row, column)` in the left grid.
    b.  Examine the color of the cell at `(row, column)` in the right grid.
    c.  If either the cell in the left grid is orange (7) OR the cell in the right grid is orange (7), set the color of the cell at `(row, column)` in the output grid to blue (1).
    d.  Otherwise (meaning both cells are white (0)), set the color of the cell at `(row, column)` in the output grid to white (0).
6.  The final output is the newly created grid.
