Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently have a height of 5 and a width of 13. They feature three colors: white (0), red (2), and orange (7). A prominent feature is a single vertical line of red (2) pixels located exactly in the middle column (column index 6). This red line divides the grid into two distinct subgrids: a left subgrid (columns 0-5) and a right subgrid (columns 7-12), each with dimensions 5x6. Both subgrids contain patterns of orange (7) and white (0) pixels.
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids consistently have a height of 5 and a width of 6, matching the dimensions of the input subgrids. They contain only two colors: white (0) and blue (1).
3.  **Transformation Hint:** The red line in the input seems to act as a separator or boundary. The output grid's dimensions strongly suggest it's derived from combining or comparing the two subgrids defined by the red line. The change in colors (orange/white in input halves, blue/white in output) indicates a specific mapping rule based on the comparison.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
Input:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: Fixed (5 rows, 13 columns)
    - Colors: White (0), Red (2), Orange (7)
    - Structure: Contains a central vertical Red (2) line at column index 6.
  Objects:
    - Separator:
      - Type: Vertical Line
      - Color: Red (2)
      - Position: Column index 6
      - Function: Divides the grid into two 5x6 subgrids.
    - Left Subgrid:
      - Dimensions: 5 rows, 6 columns (columns 0-5)
      - Colors: White (0), Orange (7)
    - Right Subgrid:
      - Dimensions: 5 rows, 6 columns (columns 7-12)
      - Colors: White (0), Orange (7)
Output:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: Fixed (5 rows, 6 columns)
    - Colors: White (0), Blue (1)
Relationship & Transformation:
  - Rule: Pixel-wise comparison between the Left and Right Subgrids of the input.
  - Mapping:
    - An output pixel at `(row, col)` is Blue (1) if the corresponding pixel in the Left Subgrid (`input[row, col]`) is Orange (7) OR the corresponding pixel in the Right Subgrid (`input[row, col + 7]`) is Orange (7).
    - An output pixel at `(row, col)` is White (0) if the corresponding pixel in the Left Subgrid (`input[row, col]`) is White (0) AND the corresponding pixel in the Right Subgrid (`input[row, col + 7]`) is White (0).
  - Ignored Elements: The Red (2) separator line is not directly represented in the output.
  - Interpretation: This resembles a logical OR operation where Orange (7) acts like 'true' and White (0) acts like 'false'. The result 'true' is represented by Blue (1) and 'false' by White (0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the vertical red line (color 2) in the input grid. This line acts as a separator.
2.  Define the "left grid" as the portion of the input grid to the left of the red line.
3.  Define the "right grid" as the portion of the input grid to the right of the red line. (Ensure both left and right grids have the same dimensions).
4.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the left grid (or the right grid).
5.  For each cell position `(row, column)` within the dimensions of the output grid:
    a.  Examine the color of the cell at `(row, column)` in the left grid.
    b.  Examine the color of the cell at `(row, column)` in the right grid.
    c.  If either the cell in the left grid is orange (7) OR the cell in the right grid is orange (7), set the color of the cell at `(row, column)` in the output grid to blue (1).
    d.  Otherwise (meaning both the cell in the left grid and the cell in the right grid are white (0)), set the color of the cell at `(row, column)` in the output grid to white (0).
6.  The final output is the newly created grid.
