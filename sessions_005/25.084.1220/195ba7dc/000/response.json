            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently have a height of 5 and a width of 13. They feature three colors: white (0), red (2), and orange (7). A prominent feature is a single vertical line of red (2) pixels located exactly in the middle column (column index 6). This red line divides the grid into two distinct subgrids: a left subgrid (columns 0-5) and a right subgrid (columns 7-12), each with dimensions 5x6. Both subgrids contain patterns of orange (7) and white (0) pixels.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids consistently have a height of 5 and a width of 6, matching the dimensions of the input subgrids. They contain only two colors: white (0) and blue (1).\n3.  **Transformation Hint:** The red line in the input seems to act as a separator or boundary. The output grid's dimensions strongly suggest it's derived from combining or comparing the two subgrids defined by the red line. The change in colors (orange/white in input halves, blue/white in output) indicates a specific mapping rule based on the comparison.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
