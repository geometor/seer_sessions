One of these objects has a unique structure and uses multiple colors (excluding gray). The other objects are composed solely of gray pixels and often have simpler shapes (like rectangles or squares in the examples). The transformation identifies the unique, non-gray object as a \"pattern\" and the gray objects as \"targets\". Each target object in the input is replaced by a copy of the pattern object in the output. The original pattern object remains in its original position in the output. The replacement aligns the top-left corner of the pattern copy with the top-left corner of the bounding box of the gray object being replaced.\n\n*   **Facts**\n    "
