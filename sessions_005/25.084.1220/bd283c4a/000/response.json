(3 cols Maroon, 1 col Gray, 1 col mixed).\n                *   Let's re-examine the actual output `train_1` right side contents:\n                    *   Col 5: `[9]*10`\n                    *   Col 6: `[9]*10`\n                    *   Col 7: `[9]*10`\n                    *   Col 8: `[5]*10`\n                    *   Col 9: `[8]*2 + [5]*8`\n                    *   Total: 30x Maroon(9), 18x Gray(5), 2x Azure(8).

Input has 29 Maroon, 19 Gray. It looks like one Gray was changed to Maroon? Where?\n\n            *   Let's re-examine `train_2` output right side contents:\n                *   Col 5: `[2]*9 + [6]*1` (Cell 9,5 is 6)\n                *   Col 6: `[2]*10`\n                *   Col 7: `[2]*10`\n                *   Col 8: `[5]*10`\n                *   Col 9: `[8]*6 + [5]*4`\n                *   Total: 29x Red(2), 14x Gray(5), 6x Azure(8), 1x Magenta(6).

Identify background color (Magenta 6).\n                2. Count background (51) and non-background (49) pixels.\n                3.

Fill output columns 5-9 (50 cells), column by column, top to bottom, using the sorted list.

Total 50. Output width 5.\n                *   Train_2: 29 Red, 14 Gray, 6 Azure. Total 49. Output width 5.\n                *   Could the number of columns dedicated to each color be proportional to its count?\n                *   Train_1: Total 50 pixels / 5 cols = 10 pixels/col.\n                    *   Maroon: 29 pixels -> 2.9 cols? -> 3 cols?

Almost matches.
