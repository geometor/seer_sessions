*   **Perception**
    *   The task involves transforming a small input grid (4x4 in all examples) into a larger output grid (4x20 in all examples).
    *   The height of the grid remains constant (4 rows).
    *   The width of the grid increases by a factor of 5 (from 4 columns to 20 columns).
    *   The output grid appears to be constructed by repeatedly placing copies of the input grid, or modified versions of it, side-by-side.
    *   Observing the pattern within the output grid reveals an alternating sequence. The first 4 columns match the input grid exactly. The next 4 columns (columns 5-8) match a horizontally flipped version of the input grid. This pattern of [original, flipped] repeats, ending with an original block. The full sequence is [original, flipped, original, flipped, original].

*   **Natural Language Program**
    1.  Identify the input grid.
    2.  Create a horizontally flipped version of the input grid (reverse the order of the columns).
    3.  Construct the output grid by concatenating the following grids horizontally, in order:
        a.  The original input grid.
        b.  The horizontally flipped grid.
        c.  The original input grid.
        d.  The horizontally flipped grid.
        e.  The original input grid.
    4.  The resulting concatenated grid is the final output.
