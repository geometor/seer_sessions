*   **Perception:** The input is a grid containing several distinct objects composed of colored pixels against a white background. The output is a single-column grid listing specific colors. Each example shows different colors and object arrangements in the input. The output column's height corresponds to the number of unique non-white colors in the input. The order of colors in the output seems related to the properties of the objects in the input.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Identify unique non-white colors in the input grid and output them in a single column, sorted by the total count of pixels for each color in descending order.
    
    elements:
      - type: grid
        role: input
        content: Contains pixels of various colors (0-9), with 0 representing white (background).
        properties:
          - Contains multiple distinct 'objects' (contiguous areas of the same non-white color).
      - type: grid
        role: output
        content: Contains a single column of non-white colors.
        properties:
          - Height equals the number of unique non-white colors in the input.
          - Width is always 1.
          - Contains only colors present in the input grid (excluding white).
    
    transformation:
      - step: 1
        action: Identify unique non-white colors
        input: input grid
        output: set of unique colors (e.g., {1, 2, 7} for example 1)
      - step: 2
        action: Count pixels for each unique color
        input: input grid, set of unique colors
        output: mapping of color to pixel count (e.g., {1: 7, 2: 4, 7: 6} for example 1)
      - step: 3
        action: Sort colors by pixel count
        input: mapping of color to pixel count
        criteria: Descending order of count
        output: ordered list of colors (e.g., [1, 7, 2] for example 1)
      - step: 4
        action: Format as single-column grid
        input: ordered list of colors
        output: output grid
    
    relationships:
      - The set of colors in the output grid is the set of unique non-white colors from the input grid.
      - The order of colors in the output grid is determined by the total number of pixels of each color in the input grid (most frequent color first).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Scan the input grid and find all unique colors that are not white (color 0).
    2.  For each unique non-white color found, count the total number of pixels belonging to that color across the entire input grid.
    3.  Create a list containing these unique non-white colors.
    4.  Sort this list of colors in descending order based on their corresponding pixel counts.
    5.  Construct the output grid as a single column where each row contains one color from the sorted list, maintaining the sorted order from top to bottom.
