task_description: Generate an output grid based on the locations of specific colored pixels in the input grid.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Same as input grid.
  - background_color: white (0) initially.
objects:
  - object: azure_pixel
    color: azure (8)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - row: R_az
      - column: C_az
  - object: orange_pixel
    color: orange (7)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - row: R_or
      - column: C_or
actions:
  - action: find_coordinates
    inputs: [input_grid, azure_color]
    outputs: [R_az, C_az]
  - action: find_coordinates
    inputs: [input_grid, orange_color]
    outputs: [R_or, C_or]
  - action: create_output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: same as input
      - initial_color: white (0)
  - action: draw_line
    line_type: column
    coordinate: C_az
    color: azure (8)
    target: output_grid
  - action: draw_line
    line_type: row
    coordinate: R_az
    color: azure (8)
    target: output_grid
  - action: draw_line
    line_type: column
    coordinate: C_or
    color: orange (7)
    target: output_grid
  - action: draw_line
    line_type: row
    coordinate: R_or
    color: orange (7)
    target: output_grid
  - action: set_pixel
    coordinate: (R_or, C_az)
    color: red (2)
    target: output_grid
    note: This overwrites the color previously set by line drawing actions at this intersection.
  - action: set_pixel
    coordinate: (R_az, C_or)
    color: red (2)
    target: output_grid
    note: This overwrites the color previously set by line drawing actions at this intersection.
derived_facts:
  - The pixel at the original azure location (R_az, C_az) in the output should be azure (8).
  - The pixel at the original orange location (R_or, C_or) in the output should be orange (7).
  - The transformation involves projecting lines from both the azure and orange pixel coordinates onto the output grid.
  - Specific intersections (azure line crossing orange line) are marked red.
