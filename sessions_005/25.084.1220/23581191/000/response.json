            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are relatively sparse, primarily composed of white pixels (0). Each input grid contains exactly two non-white pixels: one azure (8) and one orange (7).\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are denser than the inputs. They feature a full column of azure pixels and a full row of orange pixels.\n3.  **Color Correspondence:** The azure column in the output corresponds to the column position of the azure pixel in the input. The orange row in the output corresponds to the row position of the orange pixel in the input.\n4.  **Intersection Point:** The key feature in the output is the intersection of the azure column and the orange row. This specific cell is always colored red (2).\n5.  **Overwriting Behavior:** The drawing of the orange row appears to overwrite the azure column where they intersect, except for the specific cell (`row_orange`, `col_azure`) which is explicitly set to red. For instance, in `train_1`, the cell at (`row_azure`, `col_orange`) which is (1, 6) becomes orange (from the row fill), not azure (from the column fill). Similarly, in `train_2`, cell (2, 6) becomes orange.\n6.  **Grid Size:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n7.  **Background:** The rest of the output grid remains white (0).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
