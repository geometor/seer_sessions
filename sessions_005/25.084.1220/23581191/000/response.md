Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are relatively sparse, primarily composed of white pixels (0). Each input grid contains exactly two non-white pixels: one azure (8) and one orange (7).
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are denser than the inputs. They feature a full column of azure pixels and a full row of orange pixels.
3.  **Color Correspondence:** The azure column in the output corresponds to the column position of the azure pixel in the input. The orange row in the output corresponds to the row position of the orange pixel in the input.
4.  **Intersection Point:** The key feature in the output is the intersection of the azure column and the orange row. This specific cell is always colored red (2).
5.  **Overwriting Behavior:** The drawing of the orange row appears to overwrite the azure column where they intersect, except for the specific cell (`row_orange`, `col_azure`) which is explicitly set to red. For instance, in `train_1`, the cell at (`row_azure`, `col_orange`) which is (1, 6) becomes orange (from the row fill), not azure (from the column fill). Similarly, in `train_2`, cell (2, 6) becomes orange.
6.  **Grid Size:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
7.  **Background:** The rest of the output grid remains white (0).

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Generate an output grid based on the locations of specific colored pixels in the input grid.

elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - type: input
      - type: output
      - size: Same dimensions for input and output (e.g., 9x9 in examples).
      - background_color: white (0)

  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - role: input marker 1
      - count_in_input: 1
      - location: (row_azure, col_azure)
      - action_triggered: Fills column 'col_azure' in the output with azure (8).

  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: orange (7)
      - role: input marker 2
      - count_in_input: 1
      - location: (row_orange, col_orange)
      - action_triggered: Fills row 'row_orange' in the output with orange (7).

  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - role: output intersection marker
      - location: (row_orange, col_azure)
      - derivation: Explicitly placed at the intersection of the orange row and azure column, overwriting other fills.

relationships:
  - type: positional_mapping
    description: The column of the azure pixel in the input determines the column to be filled with azure in the output.
  - type: positional_mapping
    description: The row of the orange pixel in the input determines the row to be filled with orange in the output.
  - type: intersection_override
    description: The cell at the intersection of the determined row (orange) and column (azure) is specifically colored red in the output.
  - type: fill_priority
    description: The orange row fill overwrites the azure column fill at their intersection points, except for the specific red intersection point (row_orange, col_azure).

constants:
  - azure: 8
  - orange: 7
  - red: 2
  - white: 0
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Scan the input grid to find the coordinates (row `R_az`, column `C_az`) of the single azure pixel (8).
3.  Scan the input grid to find the coordinates (row `R_or`, column `C_or`) of the single orange pixel (7).
4.  Fill the entire column `C_az` of the output grid with azure pixels (8).
5.  Fill the entire row `R_or` of the output grid with orange pixels (7). (Note: This step will overwrite the azure pixel previously placed at [`R_or`, `C_az`] with orange).
6.  Set the pixel at the specific intersection coordinates (`R_or`, `C_az`) in the output grid to red (2). (Note: This step overwrites the orange pixel placed in the previous step at this location).
7.  The resulting grid is the final output.
