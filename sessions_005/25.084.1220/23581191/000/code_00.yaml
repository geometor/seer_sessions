task_description: Generate an output grid based on the locations of specific colored pixels in the input grid.

elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - type: input
      - type: output
      - size: Same dimensions for input and output (e.g., 9x9 in examples).
      - background_color: white (0)

  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - role: input marker 1
      - count_in_input: 1
      - location: (row_azure, col_azure)
      - action_triggered: Fills column 'col_azure' in the output with azure (8).

  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: orange (7)
      - role: input marker 2
      - count_in_input: 1
      - location: (row_orange, col_orange)
      - action_triggered: Fills row 'row_orange' in the output with orange (7).

  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - role: output intersection marker
      - location: (row_orange, col_azure)
      - derivation: Explicitly placed at the intersection of the orange row and azure column, overwriting other fills.

relationships:
  - type: positional_mapping
    description: The column of the azure pixel in the input determines the column to be filled with azure in the output.
  - type: positional_mapping
    description: The row of the orange pixel in the input determines the row to be filled with orange in the output.
  - type: intersection_override
    description: The cell at the intersection of the determined row (orange) and column (azure) is specifically colored red in the output.
  - type: fill_priority
    description: The orange row fill overwrites the azure column fill at their intersection points, except for the specific red intersection point (row_orange, col_azure).

constants:
  - azure: 8
  - orange: 7
  - red: 2
  - white: 0
