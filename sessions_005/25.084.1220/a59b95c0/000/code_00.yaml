elements:
  - type: grid
    role: input
    attributes:
      shape: [H, W] # In examples, H=3, W=3
      pixels: Array of color values (0-9)
  - type: grid
    role: output
    attributes:
      shape: [H*K, W*K] # Derived from input and K
      pixels: Array of color values (0-9)
  - type: value
    role: parameter
    name: K (tiling_factor)
    description: The number of times the input grid is repeated horizontally and vertically.

relationships:
  - type: determination
    from: input grid
    to: K (tiling_factor)
    rule: K is the count of unique pixel values (colors) in the input grid.
  - type: transformation
    from: input grid
    to: output grid
    rule: The output grid is generated by tiling the input grid K times horizontally and K times vertically. The value of a pixel at output coordinates (r, c) is the same as the pixel at input coordinates (r mod H, c mod W), where H and W are the height and width of the input grid.
