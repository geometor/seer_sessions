All input grids in the training set are 3x3.\n2.  The output grid is always a square grid whose dimensions are a multiple of the input grid's dimensions (3x3).\n3.  The output grid is constructed by tiling, or repeating, the input grid pattern horizontally and vertically.\n4.  The crucial step is determining the tiling factor, i.e., how many times the input grid is repeated in each dimension (horizontally and vertically). Let's call this factor `K`.\n5.  By comparing the input grids with their corresponding output grids and calculated `K` values (`K = Output_Dimension / 3`), a pattern emerges: `K` seems to be equal to the number of distinct colors present in the input grid.\n    *   train_1: Input has colors {Orange (7), Red (2)}. Count = 2. Output is 6x6 (3*2 x 3*2). K=2.\n    *   train_2: Input has colors {Green (3), Yellow (4)}. Count = 2. Output is 6x6 (3*2 x 3*2). K=2.\n    *   train_3: Input has colors {Azure (8), Red (2), Blue (1), Green (3)}. Count = 4. Output is 12x12 (3*4 x 3*4). K=4.\n    *   train_4: Input has colors {Red (2), Green (3), Blue (1)}. Count = 3. Output is 9x9 (3*3 x 3*3). K=3.\n    *   train_5: Input has colors {Maroon (9), Orange (7), Magenta (6)}. Count = 3. Output is 9x9 (3*3 x 3*3). K=3.\nThis relationship holds for all training examples.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
