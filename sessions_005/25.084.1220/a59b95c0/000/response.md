**Perception**

The task requires transforming a small input grid into a larger output grid. Analyzing the examples reveals:
1.  All input grids in the training set are 3x3.
2.  The output grid is always a square grid whose dimensions are a multiple of the input grid's dimensions (3x3).
3.  The output grid is constructed by tiling, or repeating, the input grid pattern horizontally and vertically.
4.  The crucial step is determining the tiling factor, i.e., how many times the input grid is repeated in each dimension (horizontally and vertically). Let's call this factor `K`.
5.  By comparing the input grids with their corresponding output grids and calculated `K` values (`K = Output_Dimension / 3`), a pattern emerges: `K` seems to be equal to the number of distinct colors present in the input grid.
    *   train_1: Input has colors {Orange (7), Red (2)}. Count = 2. Output is 6x6 (3*2 x 3*2). K=2.
    *   train_2: Input has colors {Green (3), Yellow (4)}. Count = 2. Output is 6x6 (3*2 x 3*2). K=2.
    *   train_3: Input has colors {Azure (8), Red (2), Blue (1), Green (3)}. Count = 4. Output is 12x12 (3*4 x 3*4). K=4.
    *   train_4: Input has colors {Red (2), Green (3), Blue (1)}. Count = 3. Output is 9x9 (3*3 x 3*3). K=3.
    *   train_5: Input has colors {Maroon (9), Orange (7), Magenta (6)}. Count = 3. Output is 9x9 (3*3 x 3*3). K=3.
This relationship holds for all training examples.

**Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: grid
    role: input
    attributes:
      shape: [H, W] # In examples, H=3, W=3
      pixels: Array of color values (0-9)
  - type: grid
    role: output
    attributes:
      shape: [H*K, W*K] # Derived from input and K
      pixels: Array of color values (0-9)
  - type: value
    role: parameter
    name: K (tiling_factor)
    description: The number of times the input grid is repeated horizontally and vertically.

relationships:
  - type: determination
    from: input grid
    to: K (tiling_factor)
    rule: K is the count of unique pixel values (colors) in the input grid.
  - type: transformation
    from: input grid
    to: output grid
    rule: The output grid is generated by tiling the input grid K times horizontally and K times vertically. The value of a pixel at output coordinates (r, c) is the same as the pixel at input coordinates (r mod H, c mod W), where H and W are the height and width of the input grid.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Read the input grid.
2.  Find all the unique color values present in the input grid.
3.  Count the number of unique color values found. Assign this count to a variable `K`.
4.  Get the height `H` and width `W` of the input grid.
5.  Create a new output grid with height `H * K` and width `W * K`.
6.  For each row `r` from 0 to `H * K - 1` and each column `c` from 0 to `W * K - 1` in the output grid:
    a.  Calculate the corresponding source row in the input grid as `source_r = r % H`.
    b.  Calculate the corresponding source column in the input grid as `source_c = c % W`.
    c.  Set the color of the output grid pixel at `(r, c)` to be the color of the input grid pixel at `(source_r, source_c)`.
7.  Return the generated output grid.
