"""
Transforms a 12x6 input grid into a 3x6 output grid by combining four stacked 3x6 subgrids.
The input grid is treated as four stacked 3x6 subgrids.
For each cell (r, c) in the output grid, its color is determined by checking the corresponding stack of cells
in the input subgrids: input[r, c], input[r+3, c], input[r+6, c], and input[r+9, c].
The output color priority rule is:
1. If the bottom-most pixel in the stack (input[r+9, c]) is Azure (8), the output color is Azure (8).
2. Otherwise, the output color is the color of the first non-white (non-zero) pixel encountered when searching the stack from top to bottom: input[r, c], input[r+3, c], input[r+6, c], input[r+9, c].
3. If all four corresponding input cells are white, the output cell remains white (0).

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the transformation rule.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code attempted a transformation based on stacking four 3x6 subgrids and applying a priority rule involving the bottom pixel (Azure=8) overriding others. The results clearly show this rule is incorrect, as the code produced many incorrect Azure pixels and failed to produce the correct pixel colors in many other locations across all examples.

The key structural observation remains valid: the 12x6 input is treated as four vertically stacked 3x6 grids, and the output is a 3x6 grid derived by combining the pixels at corresponding locations in these four input subgrids.

The failure lies in the combination logic. The initial hypothesis that Azure (8) in the bottom layer unconditionally overrides was wrong. Comparing the input stacks with the expected outputs suggests a more nuanced layering or interaction rule.

**Strategy:**

1.  Re-analyze the relationship between the stack of four input pixels (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4`) and the corresponding output pixel for several failing and succeeding cases across the examples.
2.  Formulate a new hypothesis for the combination rule, focusing on the order of precedence and any special interactions, particularly involving Red (2) and Azure (8) which seemed pivotal in the analysis.
3.  Verify the new hypothesis mentally against all provided examples.

**Analysis of Examples and Metrics**

The provided results show:

*   **Consistency:** The code failed on all 6 training examples.
*   **Structure:** The output grid size (3x6) was correct in all cases, confirming the subdivision aspect.
*   **Color Palette:** The output generally used colors present in the input, except for Example 5 where the expected output contained Red (2) but the code's output did not, incorrectly placing Azure (8) instead. This points strongly towards the Red/Azure interaction being misunderstood.
*   **Error Rate:** The number of incorrect pixels per example ranged from 5 to 8 (out of 18 total pixels), indicating a significant but not total failure of the logic.

Let `p1, p2, p3, p4` be the pixels at `(r, c)`, `(r+3, c)`, `(r+6, c)`, `(r+9, c)` respectively in the 12x6 input grid for an output pixel at `(r, c)` in the 3x6 grid.

*   **Observation 1 (Layering):** In many cases, the output pixel seems to be the *first non-white* pixel encountered when scanning the stack from top to bottom (`p1` -> `p4`). (e.g., Ex1 `(0,0)` stack `5,4,2,0` -> output `5`; Ex1 `(0,4)` stack `0,4,0,8` -> output `4`).
*   **Observation 2 (Red/Azure Interaction):** The simple layering rule fails specifically when the expected output is Azure (8) but the first non-white pixel is Red (2). (e.g., Ex1 `(1,0)` stack `0,0,2,8` -> output `8`, not `2`).
*   **Observation 3 (Azure without Red):** When the first non-white pixel encountered is Azure (8) itself (i.e., `p1, p2, p3` are white, `p4` is Azure), the output is Azure (8). (e.g., Ex3 `(0,1)` stack `0,0,0,8` -> output `8`).

**Refined Hypothesis:** The transformation follows a primary rule of top-layer precedence, with a specific exception where Red is covered by Azure.

```yaml
task_structure:
  input_grid_size: 12x6
  output_grid_size: 3x6
  subdivision: Input grid is conceptually divided into four 3x6 subgrids stacked vertically.
  mapping: Each pixel (r, c) in the output grid corresponds to a stack of four pixels in the input grid: input[r, c], input[r+3, c], input[r+6, c], input[r+9, c].

      p2: color of the pixel from the second subgrid.
      p3: color of the pixel from the third subgrid.
      p4: color of the pixel from the bottom subgrid.

    outputs: first_non_white_pixel (P), its_color, its_layer_index (0-3)
    notes: If all pixels in the stack are white, the visible pixel is the bottom one (p4), which is white.

    description: Check for the specific Red/Azure interaction.
    condition: If the first_non_white_pixel (P) has color Red (2) AND the bottom pixel of the stack (p4) has color Azure (8).
    effect: The output_pixel color is set to Azure (8).
  - action: set_output_color
    description: If the override rule condition is not met, set the output_pixel color.
    effect: The output_pixel color is set to the color of the first_non_white_pixel (P).
