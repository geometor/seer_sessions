            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n### Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels, with orange (7) typically acting as the background color.\n2.  **Objects:** Non-orange pixels often form contiguous shapes (objects). These objects seem to be the primary focus of the transformation.\n3.  **Object Orientation:** Objects appear to be either primarily horizontal (width >= 1, height = 1, contained within a single row) or vertical (height > 1). Some objects might be single pixels (1x1), which can be considered horizontal.\n4.  **Transformation Rules:** There seem to be two main rules operating:\n    *   **Row Filling:** If a row in the input contains a horizontal object (a contiguous segment of non-orange color entirely within that row), the *entire* corresponding row in the output is filled with the color of that horizontal object. This fill overwrites everything else in that row.\n    *   **Vertical Propagation:** For rows that are *not* filled based on the first rule, their content seems derived from the input row, but with modifications. Specifically, if a column in the input contains a vertical object (a contiguous segment of non-orange color with height > 1), the color of that vertical object is propagated vertically into any orange (7) cells within that same column in the output, but only in the non-filled rows. Non-orange pixels from the input generally persist in these non-filled output rows unless overwritten by a vertical propagation into an orange cell.\n5.  **Precedence:** The row-filling rule based on horizontal objects takes precedence over the vertical propagation rule. If a row is filled, its original content (including parts of vertical objects) is completely replaced. Vertical propagation only affects cells that remain orange (7) in rows *not* subject to the row-filling rule.\n\n### Facts\n\n"
