One color acts as a \"background\" and remains unchanged, while the other \"foreground\" color is consistently replaced by magenta (6).\n    *   The \"background\" color in the first input row appears to be the same as the dominant color found in the second input row (excluding the first column). The \"foreground\" color is the other color present in the first input row.\n\n*   **Facts YAML**:\n    "
