Determine the set of unique colors present in the input grid.\n2. Identify the 'dynamic' colors by removing the 'static' colors (4 and 7) from the set of unique colors.\n3. Based on the specific set of dynamic colors found, select a predefined color substitution mapping. Three mappings were observed in the training examples:\n    - If dynamic colors are {1, 2, 3, 6}, the mapping is {1: 3, 3: 2, 2: 6, 6: 1}.\n    - If dynamic colors are {1, 6, 9}, the mapping is {1: 9, 9: 6, 6: 1}.\n    - If dynamic colors are {5, 6}, the mapping is {5: 6, 6: 5}.\n4. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.\n5. Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.\n6. If the pixel's color is one of the dynamic colors for the determined mapping, replace it with the corresponding color from the mapping in the output grid.\n7. If the pixel's color is a static color (4 or 7) or any other color not part of the selected dynamic set, keep the original color in the output grid.\n8.
