task_type: color_mapping
grid_properties:
  size: 8x8 (constant across examples)
  structure_preservation: true
objects:
  - type: color_region
    description: Contiguous areas of pixels with the same color.
    properties:
      - color: Integer value 0-9.
      - shape: The geometric form of the region.
      - position: Location within the grid.
relationships:
  - type: spatial_identity
    description: The shape and position of every color region are identical between the input and output grid.
actions:
  - type: color_substitution
    description: For each pixel, its color in the input determines its color in the output based on a specific mapping rule.
    target: Pixels with specific 'dynamic' colors.
    effect: Changes the color of the target pixels.
    constraints:
      - The mapping rule is specific to each input/output pair but consistent within that pair.
      - Some colors ('static' colors) are not part of the mapping and remain unchanged.
