Some colors are systematically replaced by others.\n5.  **Static Colors:** Certain colors, like orange (7) and yellow (4), seem to remain unchanged in their positions across the transformation in all examples. They act as anchors or background elements.\n6.  **Dynamic Colors:** Other colors are involved in a substitution or mapping.\n    *   **Example 1:** Blue (1) becomes green (3), green (3) becomes red (2), red (2) becomes magenta (6), and magenta (6) becomes blue (1). This forms a cycle: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 6 -> 1.\n    *   **Example 2:** Blue (1) becomes maroon (9), maroon (9) becomes magenta (6), and magenta (6) becomes blue (1). This forms a cycle: 1 -> 9 -> 6 -> 1.\n    *   **Example 3:** Gray (5) becomes magenta (6), and magenta (6) becomes gray (5). This is a simple swap: 5 <-> 6.\n7.  **Consistent Mapping:** Within each example pair, the color substitution rule is applied consistently to all pixels of the affected colors.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
