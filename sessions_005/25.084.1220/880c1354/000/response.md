Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grids:** Both input and output are 8x8 grids of colored pixels.
2.  **Color Regions:** The grids contain distinct regions formed by contiguous pixels of the same color.
3.  **Structural Preservation:** The overall shapes and positions of these colored regions appear identical between the input and output grids in each example pair.
4.  **Color Changes:** The key difference between input and output lies in the colors used within specific regions. Some colors are systematically replaced by others.
5.  **Static Colors:** Certain colors, like orange (7) and yellow (4), seem to remain unchanged in their positions across the transformation in all examples. They act as anchors or background elements.
6.  **Dynamic Colors:** Other colors are involved in a substitution or mapping.
    *   **Example 1:** Blue (1) becomes green (3), green (3) becomes red (2), red (2) becomes magenta (6), and magenta (6) becomes blue (1). This forms a cycle: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 6 -> 1.
    *   **Example 2:** Blue (1) becomes maroon (9), maroon (9) becomes magenta (6), and magenta (6) becomes blue (1). This forms a cycle: 1 -> 9 -> 6 -> 1.
    *   **Example 3:** Gray (5) becomes magenta (6), and magenta (6) becomes gray (5). This is a simple swap: 5 <-> 6.
7.  **Consistent Mapping:** Within each example pair, the color substitution rule is applied consistently to all pixels of the affected colors.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_type: color_mapping
grid_properties:
  size: 8x8 (constant across examples)
  structure_preservation: true
objects:
  - type: color_region
    description: Contiguous areas of pixels with the same color.
    properties:
      - color: Integer value 0-9.
      - shape: The geometric form of the region.
      - position: Location within the grid.
relationships:
  - type: spatial_identity
    description: The shape and position of every color region are identical between the input and output grid.
actions:
  - type: color_substitution
    description: For each pixel, its color in the input determines its color in the output based on a specific mapping rule.
    target: Pixels with specific 'dynamic' colors.
    effect: Changes the color of the target pixels.
    constraints:
      - The mapping rule is specific to each input/output pair but consistent within that pair.
      - Some colors ('static' colors) are not part of the mapping and remain unchanged.
mappings_observed:
  - example: train_1
    static_colors: [4, 7]
    dynamic_mapping: {1: 3, 3: 2, 2: 6, 6: 1} # Cycle: 1->3->2->6->1
  - example: train_2
    static_colors: [4, 7]
    dynamic_mapping: {1: 9, 9: 6, 6: 1} # Cycle: 1->9->6->1
  - example: train_3
    static_colors: [4, 7]
    dynamic_mapping: {5: 6, 6: 5} # Swap: 5<->6
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Analyze the input and output grids to determine the specific color mapping rule for this instance. Identify which input colors consistently map to which output colors, noting any colors that remain unchanged.
2.  Create an output grid identical in size to the input grid.
3.  For each pixel position (row, column) in the input grid:
    a.  Get the color value of the input pixel at that position.
    b.  Check if this input color value is part of the identified color mapping rule.
    c.  If it is part of the rule, find the corresponding output color from the mapping rule and assign this output color to the pixel at the same position in the output grid.
    d.  If the input color is *not* part of the rule (i.e., it's a static color), assign the original input color to the pixel at the same position in the output grid.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
