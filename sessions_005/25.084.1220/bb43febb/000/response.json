            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Both examples show input grids containing a white background (color 0) and one or more distinct objects made of gray pixels (color 5).\n2.  **Object Shape:** The gray objects in the inputs appear to be solid rectangles (no holes within their boundaries).\n3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids retain the same dimensions and background color as the inputs. The gray objects from the input are modified.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve altering the interior of the gray rectangles. The outermost layer (1-pixel border) of each gray rectangle remains gray. The pixels *inside* this border are changed to red (color 2).\n5.  **Condition for Change:** This internal filling with red only occurs if the rectangle is large enough to *have* an interior after removing the 1-pixel border. This implies a minimum size requirement, likely 3x3. A rectangle smaller than 3x3 (e.g., 2xN or Mx2) would not have its interior pixels changed because removing the border leaves nothing \"inside\".\n6.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds true for both `train_1` and `train_2` examples, affecting multiple rectangles of different sizes and positions within the grid.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
