Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Both examples show input grids containing a white background (color 0) and one or more distinct objects made of gray pixels (color 5).
2.  **Object Shape:** The gray objects in the inputs appear to be solid rectangles (no holes within their boundaries).
3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids retain the same dimensions and background color as the inputs. The gray objects from the input are modified.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve altering the interior of the gray rectangles. The outermost layer (1-pixel border) of each gray rectangle remains gray. The pixels *inside* this border are changed to red (color 2).
5.  **Condition for Change:** This internal filling with red only occurs if the rectangle is large enough to *have* an interior after removing the 1-pixel border. This implies a minimum size requirement, likely 3x3. A rectangle smaller than 3x3 (e.g., 2xN or Mx2) would not have its interior pixels changed because removing the border leaves nothing "inside".
6.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds true for both `train_1` and `train_2` examples, affecting multiple rectangles of different sizes and positions within the grid.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
Task: Modify solid gray rectangles

Input_Features:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains: objects

Objects:
  - type: Rectangle
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - shape: solid_rectangle (no internal holes)
      - minimum_size_for_internal_change: 3x3

Actions:
  - name: identify_objects
    target: gray (5) pixels
    criteria: form a solid rectangle
  - name: modify_interior
    target: identified solid gray rectangles (>= 3x3)
    effect: change color of interior pixels
    details:
      - interior_definition: pixels not part of the 1-pixel thick outer border
      - new_color: red (2)
  - name: preserve_border
    target: identified solid gray rectangles
    effect: keep the 1-pixel thick outer border gray (5)
  - name: preserve_others
    target: all other pixels (background, non-rectangular gray shapes, gray rectangles < 3x3)
    effect: no change in color

Output_Features:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - same dimensions as input
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains: modified gray objects (hollowed and filled) and potentially unchanged objects.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify all distinct, contiguous groups of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
3.  For each identified group of gray pixels:
    a.  Determine if the group forms a solid rectangle (i.e., it fills its bounding box completely with gray pixels).
    b.  If it is a solid rectangle, determine its width (W) and height (H).
    c.  Check if both W >= 3 and H >= 3.
    d.  If the rectangle meets the size criteria (W>=3 and H>=3):
        i.  Iterate through the pixels located strictly within the rectangle's boundaries, excluding the top-most row, bottom-most row, left-most column, and right-most column of the rectangle.
        ii. For each of these *interior* pixels, change its color in the output grid to red (2).
4.  All other pixels (background, gray pixels not forming solid rectangles, gray pixels in rectangles smaller than 3x3, and the border pixels of modified rectangles) retain their original color from the input grid in the output grid.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
