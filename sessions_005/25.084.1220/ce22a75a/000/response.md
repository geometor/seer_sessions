Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Input Grid Analysis:**
    *   The input grids consist primarily of a white (0) background.
    *   Scattered within the grid are individual gray (5) pixels.
    *   The number and positions of these gray pixels vary between examples.

2.  **Output Grid Analysis:**
    *   The output grids also have a white (0) background.
    *   They contain regions filled with blue (1) pixels.
    *   In `train_2`, these blue regions appear as distinct 3x3 squares.
    *   In `train_1`, the blue regions are larger and irregularly shaped, suggesting overlapping shapes.

3.  **Input-Output Relationship:**
    *   Comparing input and output, the locations of the gray pixels in the input seem to determine the locations of the blue regions in the output.
    *   Specifically, each gray pixel in the input appears to correspond to a 3x3 blue square in the output.
    *   The key observation, especially from `train_2`, is that the gray pixel marks the *center* of its corresponding 3x3 blue square.
    *   When these conceptual 3x3 blue squares overlap (as implied by the input gray pixel positions in `train_1`), the overlapping areas in the output remain blue, effectively merging the squares into larger shapes.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
Task: Map gray pixels to centered 3x3 blue squares.

Input:
  - Grid: A 2D array of integers (pixels).
  - Background Color: White (0).
  - Objects:
    - Type: Single Pixels
    - Color: Gray (5)
    - Distribution: Scattered, non-contiguous.

Output:
  - Grid: A 2D array of integers (pixels) of the same dimensions as the input.
  - Background Color: White (0).
  - Objects:
    - Type: Potentially overlapping 3x3 Squares
    - Color: Blue (1)
    - Formation: Generated based on input gray pixel locations.

Transformation:
  - Rule: Each gray pixel in the input grid acts as a center point for a 3x3 square of blue pixels in the output grid.
  - Process:
    1. Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
    2. Identify the coordinates (row, column) of all gray (5) pixels in the input.
    3. For each identified gray pixel coordinate (r, c):
       - Determine the 3x3 region centered at (r, c). This includes coordinates (r', c') where r' is in [r-1, r, r+1] and c' is in [c-1, c, c+1].
       - For all valid coordinates (r', c') within the grid boundaries that fall within this 3x3 region, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to blue (1).
  - Overlap Handling: If multiple 3x3 blue squares designate the same pixel, the pixel remains blue (1).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same size as the input grid, filling it entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid to find the row and column coordinates of all gray pixels (5).
3.  For each gray pixel found at coordinates (row, col):
    a.  Consider the 3x3 square region centered at (row, col).
    b.  Iterate through each cell (r, c) within this 3x3 region (from row-1 to row+1, and col-1 to col+1).
    c.  If the cell coordinate (r, c) is within the bounds of the grid dimensions, change the pixel at position (r, c) in the output grid to blue (1).
4.  Return the final output grid.
