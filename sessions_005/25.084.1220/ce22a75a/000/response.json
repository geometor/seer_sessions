Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).\n    2. Identify the coordinates (row, column) of all gray (5) pixels in the input.\n    3. For each identified gray pixel coordinate (r, c):\n       - Determine the 3x3 region centered at (r, c). This includes coordinates (r', c') where r' is in [r-1, r, r+1] and c' is in [c-1, c, c+1].\n       - For all valid coordinates (r', c') within the grid boundaries that fall within this 3x3 region, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to blue (1).\n  - Overlap Handling: If multiple 3x3 blue squares designate the same pixel, the pixel remains blue (1).\n```"
