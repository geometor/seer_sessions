Task: Map gray pixels to centered 3x3 blue squares.

Input:
  - Grid: A 2D array of integers (pixels).
  - Background Color: White (0).
  - Objects:
    - Type: Single Pixels
    - Color: Gray (5)
    - Distribution: Scattered, non-contiguous.

Output:
  - Grid: A 2D array of integers (pixels) of the same dimensions as the input.
  - Background Color: White (0).
  - Objects:
    - Type: Potentially overlapping 3x3 Squares
    - Color: Blue (1)
    - Formation: Generated based on input gray pixel locations.

Transformation:
  - Rule: Each gray pixel in the input grid acts as a center point for a 3x3 square of blue pixels in the output grid.
  - Process:
    1. Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
    2. Identify the coordinates (row, column) of all gray (5) pixels in the input.
    3. For each identified gray pixel coordinate (r, c):
       - Determine the 3x3 region centered at (r, c). This includes coordinates (r', c') where r' is in [r-1, r, r+1] and c' is in [c-1, c, c+1].
       - For all valid coordinates (r', c') within the grid boundaries that fall within this 3x3 region, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to blue (1).
  - Overlap Handling: If multiple 3x3 blue squares designate the same pixel, the pixel remains blue (1).
