The areas previously occupied by the gray rectangles are now filled with patterns using blue (color 1), red (color 2), and yellow (color 4) pixels.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation focuses solely on the gray rectangular objects found in the input. Each pixel within a gray rectangle is assigned a new color in the output based on its position relative to the boundary of that rectangle.\n4.  **Color Mapping Rule:**\n    *   Pixels at the four corners of a gray rectangle are changed to blue (1).\n    *   Pixels along the edges of the rectangle (excluding the corners) are changed to yellow (4).\n    *   Pixels in the interior of the rectangle (not corners or edges) are changed to red (2).\n5.  **Object Independence:** If there are multiple gray rectangles in the input, this transformation rule is applied independently to each one.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

If the pixel is one of the four corners (i.e., (`r` is min/max row AND `c` is min/max column)), change its color in the output grid to blue (1).\n        ii.
