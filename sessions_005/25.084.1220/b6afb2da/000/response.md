Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consist of a white background (color 0) and one or more solid rectangular objects composed of gray pixels (color 5).
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the same dimensions and the white background pixels remain unchanged. The areas previously occupied by the gray rectangles are now filled with patterns using blue (color 1), red (color 2), and yellow (color 4) pixels.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation focuses solely on the gray rectangular objects found in the input. Each pixel within a gray rectangle is assigned a new color in the output based on its position relative to the boundary of that rectangle.
4.  **Color Mapping Rule:**
    *   Pixels at the four corners of a gray rectangle are changed to blue (1).
    *   Pixels along the edges of the rectangle (excluding the corners) are changed to yellow (4).
    *   Pixels in the interior of the rectangle (not corners or edges) are changed to red (2).
5.  **Object Independence:** If there are multiple gray rectangles in the input, this transformation rule is applied independently to each one.

## Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - cells: contain integer values 0-9 (colors)
      - background_color: white (0)

  - element: object
    identified_by:
      - contiguous block of same-colored pixels
    in_input:
      - type: gray_rectangle
        properties:
          - color: gray (5)
          - shape: rectangle (solid fill)
    in_output:
      - type: patterned_rectangle
        properties:
          - same bounding box as corresponding input gray_rectangle
          - contains pixels of blue (1), red (2), yellow (4)

relationships:
  - type: spatial_position
    applies_to: pixels within a gray_rectangle
    defines:
      - role: corner
        description: Pixels at the minimum and maximum row/column intersections of the rectangle's bounding box.
      - role: edge
        description: Pixels on the minimum/maximum row or column lines of the bounding box, excluding corners.
      - role: interior
        description: Pixels within the bounding box that are not corners or edges.

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: gray_rectangles
    input: input grid
    output: list of gray_rectangles (defined by bounding box or pixel coordinates)

  - action: map_color
    target: pixels within each identified gray_rectangle
    input: pixel position (row, col), rectangle bounding box
    rules:
      - if pixel is a corner: output color is blue (1)
      - if pixel is an edge (not corner): output color is yellow (4)
      - if pixel is interior: output color is red (2)

  - action: preserve_color
    target: pixels not part of any gray_rectangle
    input: pixel color
    output: same pixel color (white, 0)

  - action: construct_output
    input: results of map_color and preserve_color actions
    output: final output grid
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct, contiguous rectangular regions composed entirely of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
3.  For each identified gray rectangle:
    a.  Determine the coordinates of its bounding box (minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, maximum column).
    b.  Iterate through each pixel (row `r`, column `c`) within this bounding box.
    c.  Check the position of the pixel relative to the bounding box:
        i.  If the pixel is one of the four corners (i.e., (`r` is min/max row AND `c` is min/max column)), change its color in the output grid to blue (1).
        ii. Else if the pixel is on one of the four edges but not a corner (i.e., (`r` is min/max row OR `c` is min/max column) AND it's not a corner), change its color in the output grid to yellow (4).
        iii. Else (the pixel must be an interior pixel), change its color in the output grid to red (2).
4.  Return the modified output grid. Pixels that were not part of any gray rectangle remain unchanged (white, 0).
