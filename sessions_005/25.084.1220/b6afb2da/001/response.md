"""
Identifies contiguous rectangular regions of gray (5) pixels in the input grid. 
For each gray rectangle found, it recolors the pixels based on their position within the rectangle:
- Corner pixels are changed to blue (1).
- Edge pixels (excluding corners) are changed to yellow (4).
- Interior pixels are changed to red (2).
Pixels that are not part of any gray rectangle (like the white background, 0) remain unchanged.
