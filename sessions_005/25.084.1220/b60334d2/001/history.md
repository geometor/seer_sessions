Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example (9x9).
2.  **Colors:**
    *   Input grids contain only white (0) and gray (5) pixels.
    *   Output grids contain white (0), blue (1), and gray (5) pixels.
3.  **Key Feature:** The gray (5) pixels in the input seem to be the trigger points for the transformation.
4.  **Transformation:** Around each gray pixel in the input, a specific 3x3 pattern appears in the output, centered at the location of the original gray pixel.
5.  **The Pattern:** The pattern consistently looks like this:
    
```
    Gray Blue Gray   (5 1 5)
    Blue White Blue  (1 0 1)
    Gray Blue Gray   (5 1 5)
    ```

    Notably, the center of the pattern in the output grid (where the original gray pixel was) is white (0), not gray (5).
6.  **Overlapping Patterns:** In `train_2`, the generated patterns partially overlap. The way they overlap suggests that the patterns are drawn onto the grid, potentially overwriting the background (white) or pixels from other patterns. Since the pattern elements (1 and 5) are non-zero (non-white), they overwrite the white background. The examples don't show conflicts where two different non-zero colors try to occupy the same cell, but it appears the rule is simply to place the pattern values.
7.  **Object Persistence:** The original gray pixels do not persist; they are replaced by the central white pixel of the 3x3 pattern. The transformation creates new structures (the patterns) based on the locations of the input gray pixels.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: pattern_generation
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - background_color: Predominantly white (0).
input_features:
  - objects:
      - type: isolated pixels
      - color: gray (5)
      - role: trigger points for transformation
output_features:
  - objects:
      - type: 3x3 patterns
      - structure:
          - corners: gray (5)
          - orthogonal_neighbors: blue (1)
          - center: white (0)
      - generation: Centered at the location of each gray (5) pixel from the input.
  - interaction:
      - Patterns can overlap.
      - Overlapping rule: Pattern pixels overwrite the background (white) and potentially other pattern pixels (though no conflicts are seen in examples). The value written seems absolute based on the pattern definition.
transformation:
  - type: replacement and expansion
  - trigger: gray (5) pixel in input
  - action: Replace the trigger pixel with white (0) and draw a specific 3x3 pattern (515 / 101 / 515) around it in the output grid.
boundary_conditions:
  - Patterns are clipped at the grid boundaries (parts falling outside are ignored).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
2.  Identify the coordinates (row, column) of every gray (5) pixel in the input grid.
3.  For each identified gray pixel location `(r, c)`:
    a.  Define the 3x3 pattern centered at `(r, c)`. The pattern consists of:
        *   Gray (5) at the four corner positions relative to `(r, c)`: `(r-1, c-1)`, `(r-1, c+1)`, `(r+1, c-1)`, `(r+1, c+1)`.
        *   Blue (1) at the four orthogonal neighbor positions relative to `(r, c)`: `(r-1, c)`, `(r+1, c)`, `(r, c-1)`, `(r, c+1)`.
        *   White (0) at the center position `(r, c)`.
    b.  For each of the 9 positions `(pr, pc)` covered by this pattern:
        i.  Check if the position `(pr, pc)` is within the valid row and column boundaries of the output grid.
        ii. If it is within bounds, set the pixel value at `(pr, pc)` in the output grid to the color specified by the pattern for that relative position. This overwrites any previous value at that location in the output grid (including the initial white background or values from previously drawn patterns).
4.  After processing all gray pixels from the input, the resulting output grid is the final result.
