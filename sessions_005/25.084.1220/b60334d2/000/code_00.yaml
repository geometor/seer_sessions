task_type: pattern_generation
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - background_color: Predominantly white (0).
input_features:
  - objects:
      - type: isolated pixels
      - color: gray (5)
      - role: trigger points for transformation
output_features:
  - objects:
      - type: 3x3 patterns
      - structure:
          - corners: gray (5)
          - orthogonal_neighbors: blue (1)
          - center: white (0)
      - generation: Centered at the location of each gray (5) pixel from the input.
  - interaction:
      - Patterns can overlap.
      - Overlapping rule: Pattern pixels overwrite the background (white) and potentially other pattern pixels (though no conflicts are seen in examples). The value written seems absolute based on the pattern definition.
transformation:
  - type: replacement and expansion
  - trigger: gray (5) pixel in input
  - action: Replace the trigger pixel with white (0) and draw a specific 3x3 pattern (515 / 101 / 515) around it in the output grid.
boundary_conditions:
  - Patterns are clipped at the grid boundaries (parts falling outside are ignored).
