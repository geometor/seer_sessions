```python
"""
Transforms an input grid into a larger output grid by tiling.

The output grid's dimensions are 3 times the input grid's dimensions (height and width).
The output grid is constructed as a 3x3 super-grid. Each cell in this super-grid corresponds
to a pixel in the original input grid.

If a pixel in the input grid at (r, c) is non-white (value != 0), a copy of the 
entire original input grid is placed into the corresponding cell of the super-grid 
(top-left corner at output coordinates (r*H, c*W), where H and W are the input height and width).

If a pixel in the input grid at (r, c) is white (value == 0), a block of white pixels 
of the same dimensions as the input grid (H x W) is placed into the corresponding cell 
of the super-grid (top-left corner at output coordinates (r*H, c*W)).
