*   **Perception of task elements:**
    *   The task transforms a small input grid into a larger output grid.
    *   The output grid's dimensions are exactly 3 times the dimensions of the input grid (both height and width).
    *   The output grid appears to be constructed by tiling copies of the input grid or blocks of white pixels, based on the pattern of the input grid itself.
    *   Specifically, the output can be visualized as a 3x3 super-grid, where each cell in this super-grid corresponds to a pixel in the original 3x3 input grid.
    *   If a pixel in the input grid is non-white, the corresponding cell in the 3x3 super-grid contains a copy of the entire original input grid.
    *   If a pixel in the input grid is white (0), the corresponding cell in the 3x3 super-grid contains a block of all white pixels, matching the dimensions of the input grid.

*   **YAML documenting facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Tiling based on input pattern.
    grid_relationship:
      input_size: H x W
      output_size: (3*H) x (3*W)
    output_structure:
      type: Super-grid
      grid_dimensions: 3 x 3 (in terms of subgrids)
      subgrid_dimensions: H x W (same as input grid)
    transformation_rule:
      for_each: pixel (r, c) in input_grid
      condition: input_grid[r][c] != 0 (non-white)
      action: Place a copy of the original input_grid into the output grid at the subgrid position corresponding to (r, c). The top-left corner of the copy is at output grid coordinates (r*H, c*W).
      condition: input_grid[r][c] == 0 (white)
      action: Place a H x W block of white pixels (0) into the output grid at the subgrid position corresponding to (r, c). The top-left corner of the white block is at output grid coordinates (r*H, c*W).
    objects:
      - input_grid: The original small grid.
      - output_grid: The resulting larger grid.
      - subgrid_copy: A copy of the input_grid used for tiling.
      - white_block: A grid of the same size as the input_grid, filled with white pixels (0).
      - input_pixels: Individual cells within the input grid that determine the tiling pattern.
    properties:
      - grid_dimensions: height and width.
      - pixel_color: Value from 0-9.
      - subgrid_position: Location within the 3x3 super-grid structure of the output.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Get the height (`H`) and width (`W`) of the input grid.
    2.  Create a new output grid with height `3*H` and width `3*W`.
    3.  Create a template grid called `white_block` with dimensions `H` x `W`, filled entirely with white pixels (value 0).
    4.  Iterate through each row `r` from 0 to `H-1` and each column `c` from 0 to `W-1` of the input grid.
    5.  Examine the pixel value at `input_grid[r][c]`.
    6.  Determine the target top-left coordinates in the output grid for the current subgrid: `target_row = r * H`, `target_col = c * W`.
    7.  If `input_grid[r][c]` is not white (value is not 0):
        *   Select the original `input_grid` as the `source_block`.
    8.  Else (if `input_grid[r][c]` is white):
        *   Select the `white_block` as the `source_block`.
    9.  Copy the pixels from the selected `source_block` (which is `H`x`W`) into the output grid, starting at `(target_row, target_col)`.
    10. After iterating through all input pixels, return the completed output grid.
