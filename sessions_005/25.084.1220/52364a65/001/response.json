Identify the background color, which is azure (8).\n2.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n3.  For each row in the grid:\n    a.  Find all contiguous horizontal segments of non-background colors.\n    b.  For each segment found:\n        i.  Determine its width (number of pixels) and its starting and ending column indices.\n        ii. If the segment's width is greater than 2: Change the color of the pixels at the starting column index and the starting column index + 1 in the output grid's current row to the background color (azure 8).\n        iii. If the segment's width is 2 or less: Check if the segment's starting column index is 0 OR if its ending column index is the last column index of the grid.\n            1.  If either condition is true (it touches a vertical edge): Change the color of all pixels within this segment's column range in the output grid's current row to the background color (azure 8).\n            2.  If neither condition is true (it does not touch a vertical edge): Leave the segment's pixels unchanged in the output grid.\n4.
