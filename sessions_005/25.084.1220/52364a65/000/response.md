*   **Perception**:
    *   The task involves modifying input grids based on horizontal segments of non-background colors within each row.
    *   The background color appears to be consistently azure (8).
    *   The transformation rule depends on the width of these horizontal segments and their position relative to the left and right edges of the grid.
    *   Segments wider than 2 pixels are always "eroded" by 2 pixels from their left side, meaning the 2 leftmost pixels of the segment are replaced by the background color.
    *   Segments with a width of 2 pixels or less are treated differently: they are completely removed (replaced by the background color) *only if* they touch the leftmost or rightmost column of the grid in that specific row. Otherwise, short segments are left unchanged.
    *   The transformation is applied independently to each row.

      grid_properties:
        - size: variable (e.g., 11x11, 9x9)
        - background_color: azure (8) # Inferred as the predominant color / corner color

          description: Contiguous horizontal run of pixels with color != background_color within a single row.
          properties:
            - color: any color except azure (8)
            - width: integer >= 1
            - position: defined by start and end column indices within a row
            - touches_left_edge: boolean (true if start column index is 0)
            - touches_right_edge: boolean (true if end column index is grid_width - 1)
      transformation:
        type: selective_erosion_or_removal
        target: foreground_segment
        rules:
          - condition: width > 2
            action: replace the 2 leftmost pixels of the segment with background_color.
          - condition: width <= 2 AND (touches_left_edge OR touches_right_edge)
            action: replace all pixels of the segment with background_color.
          - condition: width <= 2 AND NOT (touches_left_edge OR touches_right_edge)
            action: no change to the segment.
        granularity: row-based, applied independently to each segment found.

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the background color, which is azure (8).
    2.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    3.  For each row in the grid:
        a.  Find all contiguous horizontal segments of non-background colors.
        b.  For each segment found:
            i.  Determine its width (number of pixels) and its starting and ending column indices.
            ii. If the segment's width is greater than 2: Change the color of the pixels at the starting column index and the starting column index + 1 in the output grid's current row to the background color (azure 8).
            iii. If the segment's width is 2 or less: Check if the segment's starting column index is 0 OR if its ending column index is the last column index of the grid.
                1.  If either condition is true (it touches a vertical edge): Change the color of all pixels within this segment's column range in the output grid's current row to the background color (azure 8).
                2.  If neither condition is true (it does not touch a vertical edge): Leave the segment's pixels unchanged in the output grid.
    4.  Return the modified output grid.
