Okay, let's analyze the task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** All training examples take a small grid (specifically 3x3 in all examples) as input and produce a larger grid as output. The output grid's dimensions are always a multiple of the input grid's dimensions.
2.  **Pixel Mapping:** Each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a square block of pixels of the same color in the output grid. The position of the block in the output grid corresponds to the position of the original pixel in the input grid, scaled up.
3.  **Scaling Factor:** The size of the square block (and thus the overall scaling factor for the grid dimensions) varies between examples.
    *   Example 1: 3x3 input -> 9x9 output. Scaling factor = 3. Each input pixel becomes a 3x3 block.
    *   Example 2: 3x3 input -> 6x6 output. Scaling factor = 2. Each input pixel becomes a 2x2 block.
    *   Example 3: 3x3 input -> 9x9 output. Scaling factor = 3. Each input pixel becomes a 3x3 block.
    *   Example 4: 3x3 input -> 12x12 output. Scaling factor = 4. Each input pixel becomes a 4x4 block.
    *   Example 5: 3x3 input -> 6x6 output. Scaling factor = 2. Each input pixel becomes a 2x2 block.
4.  **Determining the Scaling Factor:** The key challenge is determining the scaling factor based *only* on the input grid. Let's denote the scaling factor as 'N'.
    *   Observing the relationship between the input content and 'N':
        *   Example 1: Input has non-white colors {8, 6, 9}. There are 3 distinct non-white colors. N=3.
        *   Example 2: Input has non-white colors {1, 4}. There are 2 distinct non-white colors. N=2.
        *   Example 3: Input has non-white colors {3, 2, 7}. There are 3 distinct non-white colors. N=3.
        *   Example 4: Input has non-white colors {4, 3, 2, 8}. There are 4 distinct non-white colors. N=4.
        *   Example 5: Input has non-white colors {6, 7}. There are 2 distinct non-white colors. N=2.
    *   **Hypothesis:** The scaling factor 'N' is equal to the count of distinct non-white (non-zero) colors present in the input grid.
5.  **Transformation Process:** The transformation takes each pixel from the input grid and replicates it into an N x N block in the output grid, where N is the count of distinct non-white colors in the input.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
transformation_name: pixel_block_scaling
input_object:
  type: grid
  properties:
    - contains pixels of various colors (0-9)
    - size varies (though all examples are 3x3)
output_object:
  type: grid
  properties:
    - larger dimensions than the input grid
    - dimensions are N times the input dimensions, where N is the scaling factor
    - composed of N x N blocks, each block having the color of the corresponding input pixel
parameters:
  - scaling_factor_N:
      description: The side length of the square block each input pixel is expanded into, and the factor by which grid dimensions are scaled.
      derivation: Count the number of unique non-white (value > 0) pixel colors present in the input grid.
relationship:
  - type: scaling
  - description: Each pixel at input coordinate (r, c) with color C is mapped to an N x N block of color C in the output grid, starting at output coordinate (r * N, c * N).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Identify all unique pixel values in the input grid, excluding white (value 0).
3.  Count the number of these unique non-white values. Let this count be 'N'. This 'N' is the scaling factor.
4.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
5.  Create a new output grid with dimensions (H * N) height and (W * N) width, initially filled with a default color (e.g., white).
6.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at row `r` (from 0 to H-1) and column `c` (from 0 to W-1).
7.  Let the color of the input pixel at `(r, c)` be `C`.
8.  In the output grid, fill the square block of pixels defined by rows from `r * N` to `r * N + N - 1` and columns from `c * N` to `c * N + N - 1` with the color `C`.
9.  Return the completed output grid.
