task_type: grid_transformation
transformation_name: pixel_block_scaling
input_object:
  type: grid
  properties:
    - contains pixels of various colors (0-9)
    - size varies (though all examples are 3x3)
output_object:
  type: grid
  properties:
    - larger dimensions than the input grid
    - dimensions are N times the input dimensions, where N is the scaling factor
    - composed of N x N blocks, each block having the color of the corresponding input pixel
parameters:
  - scaling_factor_N:
      description: The side length of the square block each input pixel is expanded into, and the factor by which grid dimensions are scaled.
      derivation: Count the number of unique non-white (value > 0) pixel colors present in the input grid.
relationship:
  - type: scaling
  - description: Each pixel at input coordinate (r, c) with color C is mapped to an N x N block of color C in the output grid, starting at output coordinate (r * N, c * N).
