            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** All training examples take a small grid (specifically 3x3 in all examples) as input and produce a larger grid as output. The output grid's dimensions are always a multiple of the input grid's dimensions.\n2.  **Pixel Mapping:** Each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a square block of pixels of the same color in the output grid. The position of the block in the output grid corresponds to the position of the original pixel in the input grid, scaled up.\n3.  **Scaling Factor:** The size of the square block (and thus the overall scaling factor for the grid dimensions) varies between examples.\n    *   Example 1: 3x3 input -> 9x9 output. Scaling factor = 3. Each input pixel becomes a 3x3 block.\n    *   Example 2: 3x3 input -> 6x6 output. Scaling factor = 2. Each input pixel becomes a 2x2 block.\n    *   Example 3: 3x3 input -> 9x9 output. Scaling factor = 3. Each input pixel becomes a 3x3 block.\n    *   Example 4: 3x3 input -> 12x12 output. Scaling factor = 4. Each input pixel becomes a 4x4 block.\n    *   Example 5: 3x3 input -> 6x6 output. Scaling factor = 2. Each input pixel becomes a 2x2 block.\n4.  **Determining the Scaling Factor:** The key challenge is determining the scaling factor based *only* on the input grid. Let's denote the scaling factor as 'N'.\n    *   Observing the relationship between the input content and 'N':\n        *   Example 1: Input has non-white colors {8, 6, 9}. There are 3 distinct non-white colors. N=3.\n        *   Example 2: Input has non-white colors {1, 4}. There are 2 distinct non-white colors. N=2.\n        *   Example 3: Input has non-white colors {3, 2, 7}. There are 3 distinct non-white colors. N=3.\n        *   Example 4: Input has non-white colors {4, 3, 2, 8}. There are 4 distinct non-white colors. N=4.\n        *   Example 5: Input has non-white colors {6, 7}. There are 2 distinct non-white colors. N=2.\n    *   **Hypothesis:** The scaling factor 'N' is equal to the count of distinct non-white (non-zero) colors present in the input grid.\n5.  **Transformation Process:** The transformation takes each pixel from the input grid and replicates it into an N x N block in the output grid, where N is the count of distinct non-white colors in the input.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
