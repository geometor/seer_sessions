Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid contains exactly two prominent linear structures made of non-white pixels: one oriented horizontally and one oriented vertically. These lines intersect at a single point. The rest of the grid is typically white (0), but other colors might be present.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid largely resembles the input grid, preserving the original horizontal and vertical lines.
3.  **Transformation:** The key change occurs in a 3x3 area centered precisely on the intersection point of the two lines found in the input.
4.  **Color Change:** Within this 3x3 area, all pixels *except* the central intersection pixel itself are changed to yellow (4). The pixel at the exact intersection retains its original color from the input grid. Pixels outside this 3x3 area are unchanged.

**Facts**


```yaml
Observations:
  - Task involves modifying a grid based on intersecting lines.
  - Each input grid contains exactly one horizontal line/segment and one vertical line/segment composed of non-white pixels.
  - These two lines intersect at a single, unique pixel.
  - The transformation focuses on a 3x3 region centered at this intersection point.

Objects:
  - Horizontal_Line: A contiguous sequence of non-white pixels in a single row.
  - Vertical_Line: A contiguous sequence of non-white pixels in a single column.
  - Intersection_Point: The single pixel where the Horizontal_Line and Vertical_Line overlap.
  - Background: Pixels not part of the Horizontal_Line or Vertical_Line (often white, but can be other colors).
  - Modification_Region: A 3x3 square area centered on the Intersection_Point.

Properties:
  - Intersection_Point:
    - Has coordinates (row, column).
    - Retains its original color in the output.
  - Modification_Region_Pixels (excluding center):
    - Are changed to a specific color: yellow (4).
  - Pixels_Outside_Modification_Region:
    - Retain their original color from the input.

Relationships:
  - The Modification_Region is spatially centered on the Intersection_Point.
  - The Intersection_Point is the unique pixel common to both the Horizontal_Line and the Vertical_Line.

Actions:
  - Identify the Horizontal_Line and Vertical_Line.
  - Locate the Intersection_Point.
  - Define the 3x3 Modification_Region around the Intersection_Point.
  - For each pixel within the Modification_Region:
    - If it is the Intersection_Point, preserve its color.
    - Otherwise, change its color to yellow (4).
  - Preserve the color of all pixels outside the Modification_Region.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to identify the unique pixel that belongs to both a horizontal sequence of non-white pixels and a vertical sequence of non-white pixels. This is the `intersection_point`. Record its coordinates (`center_row`, `center_col`).
3.  Iterate through the 3x3 grid neighborhood centered at the `intersection_point`. This neighborhood includes pixels from `(center_row - 1, center_col - 1)` to `(center_row + 1, center_col + 1)`.
4.  For each pixel `(r, c)` within this 3x3 neighborhood (and also within the grid boundaries):
    a.  Check if `(r, c)` is the exact `intersection_point` (i.e., if `r == center_row` and `c == center_col`).
    b.  If it is *not* the `intersection_point`, change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to yellow (4).
    c.  If it *is* the `intersection_point`, leave its color unchanged in the output grid (it retains the color from the input grid).
5.  Return the modified output grid.
