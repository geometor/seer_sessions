            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid contains exactly two prominent linear structures made of non-white pixels: one oriented horizontally and one oriented vertically. These lines intersect at a single point. The rest of the grid is typically white (0), but other colors might be present.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid largely resembles the input grid, preserving the original horizontal and vertical lines.\n3.  **Transformation:** The key change occurs in a 3x3 area centered precisely on the intersection point of the two lines found in the input.\n4.  **Color Change:** Within this 3x3 area, all pixels *except* the central intersection pixel itself are changed to yellow (4). The pixel at the exact intersection retains its original color from the input grid. Pixels outside this 3x3 area are unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Scan the input grid to identify the unique pixel that belongs to both a horizontal sequence of non-white pixels and a vertical sequence of non-white pixels. This is the `intersection_point`. Record its coordinates (`center_row`, `center_col`).\n3.  Iterate through the 3x3 grid neighborhood centered at the `intersection_point`. This neighborhood includes pixels from `(center_row - 1, center_col - 1)` to `(center_row + 1, center_col + 1)`.\n4.  For each pixel `(r, c)` within this 3x3 neighborhood (and also within the grid boundaries):\n    a.  Check if `(r, c)` is the exact `intersection_point` (i.e., if `r == center_row` and `c == center_col`).\n    b.  If it is *not* the `intersection_point`, change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to yellow (4).\n    c.  If it *is* the `intersection_point`, leave its color unchanged in the output grid (it retains the color from the input grid).\n5.  Return the modified output grid."
