Observations:
  - Task involves modifying a grid based on intersecting lines.
  - Each input grid contains exactly one horizontal line/segment and one vertical line/segment composed of non-white pixels.
  - These two lines intersect at a single, unique pixel.
  - The transformation focuses on a 3x3 region centered at this intersection point.

Objects:
  - Horizontal_Line: A contiguous sequence of non-white pixels in a single row.
  - Vertical_Line: A contiguous sequence of non-white pixels in a single column.
  - Intersection_Point: The single pixel where the Horizontal_Line and Vertical_Line overlap.
  - Background: Pixels not part of the Horizontal_Line or Vertical_Line (often white, but can be other colors).
  - Modification_Region: A 3x3 square area centered on the Intersection_Point.

Properties:
  - Intersection_Point:
    - Has coordinates (row, column).
    - Retains its original color in the output.
  - Modification_Region_Pixels (excluding center):
    - Are changed to a specific color: yellow (4).
  - Pixels_Outside_Modification_Region:
    - Retain their original color from the input.

Relationships:
  - The Modification_Region is spatially centered on the Intersection_Point.
  - The Intersection_Point is the unique pixel common to both the Horizontal_Line and the Vertical_Line.

Actions:
  - Identify the Horizontal_Line and Vertical_Line.
  - Locate the Intersection_Point.
  - Define the 3x3 Modification_Region around the Intersection_Point.
  - For each pixel within the Modification_Region:
    - If it is the Intersection_Point, preserve its color.
    - Otherwise, change its color to yellow (4).
  - Preserve the color of all pixels outside the Modification_Region.
