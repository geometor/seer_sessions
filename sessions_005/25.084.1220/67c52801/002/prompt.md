"""
Simulates gravity on a 2D grid of pixels. Non-white pixels fall downwards until they hit the bottom row, the bottom edge of the grid, or another non-white pixel. The bottom-most row of the grid acts as a stable floor and its pixels do not move. The process repeats until no more pixels can fall.
