            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels. The grid sizes vary between examples.\n2.  **Background:** The background color is consistently white (0).\n3.  **Objects:** The grids contain distinct objects, which are contiguous areas of non-white pixels. These objects have different colors (Azure, Green, Red, Gray, Magenta, Orange, Blue).\n4.  **Floor/Base:** In all examples, the bottom-most row of the grid contains non-white pixels, forming a stable \"floor\". This floor seems to remain unchanged from input to output.\n5.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation appears to be a form of \"gravity\". Objects that are not part of the bottom-most row fall downwards.\n6.  **Falling Behavior:** Objects fall vertically until they encounter either:\n    *   The bottom boundary of the grid.\n    *   The stable floor row.\n    *   Another object that has already settled.\n7.  **Object Integrity:** Objects maintain their shape and color during the fall. They do not deform or break apart, they simply translate downwards as a whole unit, although the implementation might move pixel by pixel.\n8.  **Interaction:** Objects stack on top of each other and on top of the floor when they fall. They do not merge or change color upon contact.\n\n**Facts YAML**\n\n"
