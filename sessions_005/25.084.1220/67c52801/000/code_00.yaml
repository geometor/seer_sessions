Elements:
  - Type: Grid
    Description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors.
  - Type: Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color: Integer from 0 to 9. 0 is white (background).
      - Position: (row, column) coordinates.
  - Type: Object
    Description: A contiguous block of one or more non-white pixels.
    Properties:
      - Color: The uniform color of the pixels in the object.
      - Shape: The spatial arrangement of the pixels.
      - Position: The location of the object within the grid.
  - Type: Floor
    Description: The bottom-most row (row H-1) of the grid, acting as a stable base.
    Properties:
      - Stability: Pixels in the floor row do not move.

Actions:
  - Name: Fall
    Actor: Object (specifically, non-white pixels not in the floor row)
    Target: Empty space (white pixel) below the object/pixel.
    Condition: The space directly below a pixel is white, and that space is not obstructed by the floor or another settled object.
    Result: The pixel moves one step down into the empty space.
  - Name: Stop
    Actor: Object/Pixel
    Condition: The space directly below the pixel is occupied by a non-white pixel (part of the floor or another object) or is the bottom edge of the grid.
    Result: The pixel ceases downward movement.

Relationships:
  - Below: Vertical adjacency. Pixel A is below Pixel B if A.row == B.row + 1 and A.col == B.col.
  - Above: Vertical adjacency. Pixel A is above Pixel B if A.row == B.row - 1 and A.col == B.col.
  - Resting On: An object/pixel stops falling because the pixel directly below it is non-white.

Process:
  - Iterative simulation of gravity.
  - Objects/pixels fall downwards step by step.
  - The process repeats until no object/pixel can move further down.
  - The floor row remains static throughout the process.
