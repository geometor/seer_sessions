Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels. The grid sizes vary between examples.
2.  **Background:** The background color is consistently white (0).
3.  **Objects:** The grids contain distinct objects, which are contiguous areas of non-white pixels. These objects have different colors (Azure, Green, Red, Gray, Magenta, Orange, Blue).
4.  **Floor/Base:** In all examples, the bottom-most row of the grid contains non-white pixels, forming a stable "floor". This floor seems to remain unchanged from input to output.
5.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation appears to be a form of "gravity". Objects that are not part of the bottom-most row fall downwards.
6.  **Falling Behavior:** Objects fall vertically until they encounter either:
    *   The bottom boundary of the grid.
    *   The stable floor row.
    *   Another object that has already settled.
7.  **Object Integrity:** Objects maintain their shape and color during the fall. They do not deform or break apart, they simply translate downwards as a whole unit, although the implementation might move pixel by pixel.
8.  **Interaction:** Objects stack on top of each other and on top of the floor when they fall. They do not merge or change color upon contact.

**Facts YAML**


```yaml
Elements:
  - Type: Grid
    Description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors.
  - Type: Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color: Integer from 0 to 9. 0 is white (background).
      - Position: (row, column) coordinates.
  - Type: Object
    Description: A contiguous block of one or more non-white pixels.
    Properties:
      - Color: The uniform color of the pixels in the object.
      - Shape: The spatial arrangement of the pixels.
      - Position: The location of the object within the grid.
  - Type: Floor
    Description: The bottom-most row (row H-1) of the grid, acting as a stable base.
    Properties:
      - Stability: Pixels in the floor row do not move.

Actions:
  - Name: Fall
    Actor: Object (specifically, non-white pixels not in the floor row)
    Target: Empty space (white pixel) below the object/pixel.
    Condition: The space directly below a pixel is white, and that space is not obstructed by the floor or another settled object.
    Result: The pixel moves one step down into the empty space.
  - Name: Stop
    Actor: Object/Pixel
    Condition: The space directly below the pixel is occupied by a non-white pixel (part of the floor or another object) or is the bottom edge of the grid.
    Result: The pixel ceases downward movement.

Relationships:
  - Below: Vertical adjacency. Pixel A is below Pixel B if A.row == B.row + 1 and A.col == B.col.
  - Above: Vertical adjacency. Pixel A is above Pixel B if A.row == B.row - 1 and A.col == B.col.
  - Resting On: An object/pixel stops falling because the pixel directly below it is non-white.

Process:
  - Iterative simulation of gravity.
  - Objects/pixels fall downwards step by step.
  - The process repeats until no object/pixel can move further down.
  - The floor row remains static throughout the process.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the bottom row index (`H-1`, where `H` is the grid height). This row is the stable "floor".
3.  Repeatedly iterate through the grid (excluding the bottom floor row) until no pixels move in a full iteration:
    a.  Scan the grid row by row from bottom to top (e.g., from row `H-2` up to row `0`).
    b.  For each column (`c`) in the current row (`r`):
        i.   Check the pixel at `(r, c)`.
        ii.  If the pixel is non-white (not 0):
            1.  Check the pixel directly below it at `(r+1, c)`.
            2.  If the pixel below is white (0), move the non-white pixel from `(r, c)` down to `(r+1, c)` by setting `output[r+1][c] = output[r][c]` and `output[r][c] = 0`. Record that a move occurred in this iteration.
4.  Once an iteration completes with no pixels moving, the process is finished. The final state of the output grid is the result.
