task_context:
  grid_size_input: [10, 10]
  grid_size_output: [10, 10]
  colors_input: [white, gray]
  colors_output: [white, gray, azure]

elements:
  - object: frame
    description: A contiguous shape made of gray (5) pixels acting as a boundary.
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - shape: variable, generally forms a perimeter
      - connectivity: contiguous
      - may_contain_gaps: true
  - object: interior_region
    description: The area(s) of white (0) pixels enclosed by the gray frame.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - location: inside the boundary defined by the frame
  - object: background
    description: The area of white (0) pixels outside the gray frame.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - location: outside the boundary defined by the frame
  - object: filled_shape
    description: The shape formed by azure (8) pixels in the output.
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - comprises:
          - the filled interior_region
          - extensions originating from gaps in the frame

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The gray frame encloses the interior_region.
  - type: adjacency
    description: Gaps in the frame are white pixels adjacent to both the frame (gray) and the filled interior (azure).

actions:
  - action: identify_frame
    description: Locate the contiguous block of gray (5) pixels.
  - action: identify_interior
    description: Determine the white (0) pixels enclosed by the frame.
  - action: fill_interior
    input: interior_region
    output: interior_region pixels changed to azure (8)
    color_change: white (0) -> azure (8)
  - action: identify_gaps
    description: Find white (0) pixels adjacent to both frame pixels (gray, 5) and filled interior pixels (azure, 8).
  - action: extend_from_gaps
    description: For each gap pixel, draw a line of azure (8) pixels outwards towards the grid edge.
    details: The direction of extension is perpendicular to the local orientation of the frame at the gap.
