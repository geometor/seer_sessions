            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Size:** Both input and output grids are 10x10 in both examples.\n2.  **Colors:** The input grids contain white (0) and gray (5) pixels. The output grids contain white (0), gray (5), and azure (8) pixels.\n3.  **Key Object:** The central element in the input is a shape made of gray (5) pixels. This shape appears to be a frame or boundary, enclosing a region of white (0) pixels. The frame is not always fully closed; it has gaps.\n    *   In `train_1`, the gray shape resembles a large 'C' connected to a horizontal line segment below it. The gap is on the top edge.\n    *   In `train_2`, the gray shape is a rectangle with a gap in the middle of the bottom edge.\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The original gray (5) frame remains unchanged in the output grid.\n    *   The white (0) region *inside* the gray frame is filled with azure (8) pixels.\n    *   There are additional azure (8) pixels extending outwards from the location of the gap(s) in the original gray frame.\n        *   In `train_1`, the gap was on the top edge, and a vertical line of azure pixels extends *upwards* from the gap location to the top edge of the grid.\n        *   In `train_2`, the gap was on the bottom edge, and a vertical line of azure pixels extends *downwards* from the gap location to the bottom edge of the grid.\n5.  **Inferred Logic:** The process seems to involve identifying the gray boundary, filling the area it encloses with azure, identifying gaps in the boundary that are adjacent to the filled area, and extending the azure color outwards from these gaps towards the grid edge.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify all white (0) pixels that are enclosed within the boundary formed by the gray frame (the \"interior\"). A flood fill starting from a known interior point, bounded by the gray pixels, can achieve this. Alternatively, flood fill from the grid edges/corners with a temporary marker, and any remaining white pixels are interior.\n4.  Change the color of all identified interior pixels in the output grid from white (0) to azure (8).\n5.  Scan the output grid to find all white (0) pixels (\"gap pixels\") that meet these conditions:\n    a.  The pixel is orthogonally adjacent to at least one gray (5) frame pixel.\n    b.  The pixel is orthogonally adjacent to at least one azure (8) pixel (which was part of the filled interior).\n6.  For each identified gap pixel at coordinates `(r, c)`:\n    a.  Determine the orthogonal direction `(dr, dc)` that points from an adjacent interior azure pixel towards the gap pixel `(r, c)`. This defines the extension direction.\n    b.  Starting from the gap pixel `(r, c)`, continue changing pixels to azure (8) in the direction `(dr, dc)` (i.e., `(r + k*dr, c + k*dc)` for `k=0, 1, 2,...`) until the boundary of the grid is reached."
