input_grid:
  description: A 2D grid of pixels with colors 0-9.
  properties:
    height: variable (9 or 11 in examples)
    width: variable (9 in examples)
    pixels:
      colors: [white(0), red(2), yellow(4), gray(5)]
      structure: Contains a single horizontal line composed entirely of gray(5) pixels, acting as a divider.
      regions:
        - region_above_divider: Contains white(0), red(2), yellow(4) pixels.
        - divider: A single row of gray(5) pixels.
        - region_below_divider: Contains white(0), red(2), yellow(4) pixels.
output_grid:
  description: A 2x2 grid filled with a single color.
  properties:
    height: 2
    width: 2
    pixels:
      colors: [red(2) or yellow(4)]
      structure: Uniformly filled with the determined output color.
transformation:
  actions:
    - identify: The total count of red(2) pixels across the entire input grid. Let this be `total_red`.
    - identify: The total count of yellow(4) pixels across the entire input grid. Let this be `total_yellow`.
    - calculate: Compare `5 * total_red` with `3 * total_yellow`.
    - determine:
        if `5 * total_red >= 3 * total_yellow`: The output color is red(2).
        else: The output color is yellow(4).
    - construct: Create a 2x2 grid filled entirely with the determined output color.
