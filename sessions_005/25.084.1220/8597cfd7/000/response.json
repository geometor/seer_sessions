This line divides the grid into two distinct regions: an upper region and a lower region.\n    *   Both regions contain scattered pixels of red (color 2) and yellow (color 4) on a white background (color 0). These colored pixels sometimes form vertical lines or segments.\n    *   The output is consistently a small 2x2 grid.\n    *   The color filling the output grid appears to depend on the relative quantities of red and yellow pixels in a specific region of the input grid.\n    *   Comparing the examples, the color of the output grid changes based on the counts of red and yellow pixels below the gray line. Example 4 has more yellow than red below the line and outputs yellow; the others have at least as many red as yellow below the line and output red.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
