*   **Perception of the Elements:**
    *   Each input grid contains a single horizontal line composed entirely of gray pixels (color 5). This line divides the grid into two distinct regions: an upper region and a lower region.
    *   Both regions contain scattered pixels of red (color 2) and yellow (color 4) on a white background (color 0). These colored pixels sometimes form vertical lines or segments.
    *   The output is consistently a small 2x2 grid.
    *   The color filling the output grid appears to depend on the relative quantities of red and yellow pixels in a specific region of the input grid.
    *   Comparing the examples, the color of the output grid changes based on the counts of red and yellow pixels below the gray line. Example 4 has more yellow than red below the line and outputs yellow; the others have at least as many red as yellow below the line and output red.

*   **YAML Facts:**

      - input_grid:
          description: A 2D grid with colored pixels (0-9).

      - output_grid:
          description: A 2x2 grid filled with a single color.
          properties:
            - dimensions: 2x2
            - color_source: Determined by input grid analysis.
      - divider:
          description: A horizontal line of gray pixels separating the input grid.
          properties:
            - color: gray (5)
            - separates: Input grid into upper and lower regions.
      - relevant_region:
          description: The portion of the input grid below the gray divider line.
          properties:
            - location: Below the gray line.
            - contains: Red pixels (2) and Yellow pixels (4).
      - comparison_logic:
          description: The rule determining the output color based on pixel counts in the relevant region.
          rule: Compare the count of red pixels (2) and yellow pixels (4) below the gray line.
          condition_red: If count(red) >= count(yellow), output color is red (2).
          condition_yellow: If count(red) < count(yellow), output color is yellow (4).
      - output_construction:
          description: Creating the final output grid.
          steps:
            - Determine the output color based on the comparison_logic.
            - Create a 2x2 grid.
            - Fill the 2x2 grid entirely with the determined output color.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the horizontal line composed entirely of gray pixels (color 5) in the input grid.
    2.  Isolate the region of the grid located below this gray line.
    3.  Count the total number of red pixels (color 2) within this lower region.
    4.  Count the total number of yellow pixels (color 4) within this lower region.
    5.  Compare the count of red pixels to the count of yellow pixels.
    6.  If the count of red pixels is greater than or equal to the count of yellow pixels, determine the output color to be red (2).
    7.  Otherwise (if the count of yellow pixels is greater than the count of red pixels), determine the output color to be yellow (4).
    8.  Construct a 2x2 output grid filled entirely with the determined output color.
