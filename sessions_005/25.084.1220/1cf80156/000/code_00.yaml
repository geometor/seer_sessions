facts:
  - scope: global
    description: Each task involves extracting a non-white object from a mostly white background.
  - scope: input
    objects:
      - name: background
        pixels: All pixels with value 0 (white).
      - name: shape
        pixels: All contiguous pixels with a value > 0 (non-white).
        properties:
          - color: The specific non-white value (e.g., 1, 2, 8).
          - contiguous: All non-white pixels are connected orthogonally or diagonally.
          - unique_color: Only one non-white color exists per input grid.
    relationships:
      - type: containment
        subject: background
        object: shape
        description: The shape is located somewhere within the background grid.
  - scope: output
    objects:
      - name: cropped_shape
        pixels: All pixels corresponding to the 'shape' from the input.
        properties:
          - color: Same as the input 'shape'.
          - relative_positions: The internal spatial arrangement of pixels is identical to the input 'shape'.
          - dimensions: Matches the bounding box of the input 'shape'.
    relationships:
      - type: extraction
        subject: input.shape
        object: output.cropped_shape
        description: The output is created by finding the bounding box of the input shape and extracting only that portion of the grid.
