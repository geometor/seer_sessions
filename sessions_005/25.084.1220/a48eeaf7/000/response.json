The background color is white (0).\n2.  **Objects:**\n    *   In each input grid, there is a single contiguous red (2) object (a 2x2 square in these examples).\n    *   There are also several individual gray (5) pixels scattered across the grid.\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The red object remains unchanged in shape, color, and position between the input and output grids.\n    *   The gray pixels change their positions from the input to the output.\n    *   In the output, the gray pixels appear to be closer to the red object than they were in the input.\n    *   Observing the movement path, each gray pixel seems to move step-by-step towards the nearest point on the red object.\n    *   The movement stops when the gray pixel lands on a cell that is adjacent (including diagonals) to any part of the red object.\n4.  **Color Consistency:** The colors of the objects (red and gray) remain the same; only the positions of the gray pixels change.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

For each identified gray pixel:\n    a.  Remove the gray pixel from its original position in the output grid (set it to white (0)).\n    b.  Calculate the Manhattan distance from the gray pixel's initial position to every red pixel identified in step 2.\n    c.  Find the minimum Manhattan distance calculated.\n    d.  Identify the target red pixel(s) that correspond to this minimum distance.

Set the gray pixel's current position to its initial position.\n    f.  Start a movement loop:\n        i.  Check if the gray pixel's current position is adjacent (including diagonals) to *any* red pixel. Two pixels (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) are adjacent if `max(abs(r1-r2), abs(c1-c2)) == 1`.\n        ii. If the current position *is* adjacent to a red pixel, exit the movement loop.\n        iii. If the current position is *not* adjacent, calculate the next step direction towards the target red pixel:\n            *   `dx = 0` if `target_row == current_row`, `1` if `target_row > current_row`, `-1` if `target_row < current_row`.\n            *   `dy = 0` if `target_col == current_col`, `1` if `target_col > current_col`, `-1` if `target_col < current_col`.\n        iv. Update the gray pixel's current position by adding `dx` to the row and `dy` to the column.\n    g.  After the loop terminates, place the gray (5) color at the final `(current_row, current_col)` position in the output grid.\n5.  Return the modified output grid."
