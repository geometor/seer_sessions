task_description: Move gray pixels towards the nearest part of a static red object until they become adjacent to it.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      size: [10, 10] # Variable, but 10x10 in examples
      background_color: white (0)

  - type: object
    id: static_object
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      shape: contiguous block (2x2 square in examples)
      static: true # Does not change position or shape

  - type: object
    id: moving_objects
    properties:
      color: gray (5)
      shape: single pixel
      count: variable (4 in train_1, 3 in train_2)
      static: false # Changes position

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Moving objects (gray) are initially scattered relative to the static object (red).
  - type: distance
    description: The transformation minimizes the Manhattan distance between each moving object and the static object, subject to a stopping condition.

actions:
  - action: identify
    actor: system
    target: static_object (red)
    details: Locate all pixels belonging to the red object.
  - action: identify
    actor: system
    target: moving_objects (gray)
    details: Locate all gray pixels.
  - action: calculate_path
    actor: system
    target: each moving_object
    details:
      - Find the nearest pixel(s) on the static_object using Manhattan distance.
      - Determine the step direction (dx, dy) towards a chosen nearest static_object pixel.
  - action: move
    actor: system
    target: each moving_object
    details:
      - Iteratively move the gray pixel one step in the calculated direction.
      - Stop when the pixel's current position is adjacent (including diagonals) to any pixel of the static_object.
      - Adjacency means the maximum of the absolute difference in row and column indices is 1.
  - action: update_grid
    actor: system
    target: output_grid
    details:
      - Copy the input grid.
      - Remove the original moving_objects.
      - Place the moving_objects at their calculated final positions.
      - Ensure the static_object remains unchanged.
