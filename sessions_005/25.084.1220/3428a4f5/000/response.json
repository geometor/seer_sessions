            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently have dimensions of 13 rows by 5 columns.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids consistently have dimensions of 6 rows by 5 columns.\n3.  **Color Palette:**\n    *   Inputs use white (0), red (2), and yellow (4).\n    *   Outputs use white (0) and green (3).\n4.  **Key Feature - Separator:** Each input grid contains a single, full row of yellow (4) pixels. In all examples, this yellow line is located at row index 6 (the 7th row).\n5.  **Grid Division:** The yellow line acts as a separator, dividing the input grid into two distinct subgrids of equal size (6x5):\n    *   An \"upper grid\" consisting of rows 0-5.\n    *   A \"lower grid\" consisting of rows 7-12.\n    *   The yellow line itself (row 6) is not directly represented in the output.\n6.  **Transformation:** The output grid (6x5) seems to be generated by combining information from the corresponding upper grid and lower grid. The dimensions match exactly.\n7.  **Pixel-wise Operation:** Comparing the upper grid, lower grid, and output grid at the same coordinates `(row, column)` suggests a pixel-wise rule:\n    *   Let `U(r, c)` be the pixel value in the upper grid at `(r, c)`.\n    *   Let `L(r, c)` be the pixel value in the lower grid at `(r, c)`.\n    *   Let `O(r, c)` be the pixel value in the output grid at `(r, c)`.\n    *   Observing the examples:\n        *   If `U(r, c)` is white (0) and `L(r, c)` is white (0), then `O(r, c)` is white (0).\n        *   If `U(r, c)` is red (2) and `L(r, c)` is white (0), then `O(r, c)` is green (3).\n        *   If `U(r, c)` is white (0) and `L(r, c)` is red (2), then `O(r, c)` is green (3).\n        *   If `U(r, c)` is red (2) and `L(r, c)` is red (2), then `O(r, c)` is white (0).\n8.  **Logical Equivalence:** This combination rule is equivalent to a bitwise XOR operation if we temporarily map white (0) to 0 and red (2) to 1. The result 0 maps back to white (0) and the result 1 maps to green (3).\n    *   `0 XOR 0 = 0` (white)\n    *   `1 XOR 0 = 1` (green)\n    *   `0 XOR 1 = 1` (green)\n    *   `1 XOR 1 = 0` (white)\n\n## Facts\n\n"
