Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grids**: The input grids vary in size. They primarily consist of a white (0) background, a structure made of gray (5) pixels, and some content made of azure (8) pixels.
2.  **Gray Structure**: The gray pixels typically form a frame or enclosure, often resembling two vertical pillars connected by a base, although variations exist (e.g., incomplete frames). This frame surrounds the azure pixels.
3.  **Azure Content**: The azure pixels are located spatially within the area enclosed or defined by the gray structure. The shape, size, and exact position of the azure block vary across examples.
4.  **Output Grids**: The output grids are consistently 3x3 in size. They contain only azure (8) and white (0) pixels. The pattern of azure pixels changes between examples.
5.  **Transformation**: The transformation discards the gray frame and the background. The output grid's pattern seems to depend not on the specific shape or size of the azure content itself, but rather on its position *relative* to the gray frame.
6.  **Key Insight**: By calculating the top-left coordinate of the bounding box containing all gray pixels and the top-left coordinate of the bounding box containing all azure pixels, we can find a relative offset (row\_diff, col\_diff). This offset pair appears to uniquely determine the specific 3x3 azure/white pattern seen in the output across all training examples. Examples with the same relative offset produce the same output grid.

**Facts**


```yaml
- task: Relative Position Encoding
  observations:
    - Input grids contain three main components:
        - background: white pixels (0)
        - frame: gray pixels (5) forming an enclosure
        - content: azure pixels (8) located inside the frame
    - Output grids are always 3x3, containing only azure (8) and white (0) pixels.
    - The transformation involves locating both the frame and the content.
  definitions:
    - bounding_box(color): The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of a given 'color'. Defined by its top-left (min_row, min_col) and bottom-right (max_row, max_col) coordinates.
    - gray_bb: bounding_box(gray)
    - azure_bb: bounding_box(azure)
  relationship:
    - If azure pixels exist:
        - Calculate the relative top-left corner offset:
            - rel_row = azure_bb.min_row - gray_bb.min_row
            - rel_col = azure_bb.min_col - gray_bb.min_col
        - This offset pair (rel_row, rel_col) maps to a specific 3x3 output grid pattern based on the training examples:
            - (1, 1) -> [[8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]] (from train_4)
            - (2, 1) -> [[8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]] (from train_1, train_6)
            - (3, 1) -> [[8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]] (from train_3, train_5)
            - (4, 1) -> [[8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0]] (from train_2)
    - If no azure pixels exist in the input:
        - The output is assumed to be a 3x3 grid of all white (0) pixels (based on the need for a default case, though not explicitly shown).
  action:
    - Determine the (rel_row, rel_col) offset.
    - Produce the corresponding 3x3 output grid based on the observed mapping.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify all gray (5) pixels in the input grid. If none are found, stop and return an error or default grid (e.g., 3x3 white).
2.  Calculate the bounding box of these gray pixels to find its top-left corner coordinate `(gray_min_row, gray_min_col)`.
3.  Identify all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
4.  If no azure pixels are found, return a 3x3 grid filled with white (0) pixels.
5.  If azure pixels are found, calculate the bounding box of these azure pixels to find its top-left corner coordinate `(azure_min_row, azure_min_col)`.
6.  Calculate the relative row offset: `rel_row = azure_min_row - gray_min_row`.
7.  Calculate the relative column offset: `rel_col = azure_min_col - gray_min_col`.
8.  Based on the calculated `(rel_row, rel_col)` pair, select the corresponding predefined 3x3 output grid pattern:
    *   If `(rel_row, rel_col)` is `(1, 1)`, output `[[8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`.
    *   If `(rel_row, rel_col)` is `(2, 1)`, output `[[8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`.
    *   If `(rel_row, rel_col)` is `(3, 1)`, output `[[8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`.
    *   If `(rel_row, rel_col)` is `(4, 1)`, output `[[8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0]]`.
    *   For any other `(rel_row, rel_col)` pair not seen in training, the behavior is undefined (assume error or default 3x3 white grid).
9.  Return the selected 3x3 grid.
