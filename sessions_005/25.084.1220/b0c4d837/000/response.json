            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grids**: The input grids vary in size. They primarily consist of a white (0) background, a structure made of gray (5) pixels, and some content made of azure (8) pixels.\n2.  **Gray Structure**: The gray pixels typically form a frame or enclosure, often resembling two vertical pillars connected by a base, although variations exist (e.g., incomplete frames). This frame surrounds the azure pixels.\n3.  **Azure Content**: The azure pixels are located spatially within the area enclosed or defined by the gray structure. The shape, size, and exact position of the azure block vary across examples.\n4.  **Output Grids**: The output grids are consistently 3x3 in size. They contain only azure (8) and white (0) pixels. The pattern of azure pixels changes between examples.\n5.  **Transformation**: The transformation discards the gray frame and the background. The output grid's pattern seems to depend not on the specific shape or size of the azure content itself, but rather on its position *relative* to the gray frame.\n6.  **Key Insight**: By calculating the top-left coordinate of the bounding box containing all gray pixels and the top-left coordinate of the bounding box containing all azure pixels, we can find a relative offset (row\\_diff, col\\_diff). This offset pair appears to uniquely determine the specific 3x3 azure/white pattern seen in the output across all training examples. Examples with the same relative offset produce the same output grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
