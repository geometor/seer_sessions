            "text": "*   **Perception**:\n    The task requires analyzing an input grid of colored pixels and producing a 1x1 output grid containing a single color. The input grids vary in size and contain various colored shapes and lines, often against a white (0) background. The output color seems to be determined by examining the horizontal rows of the input grid. There appear to be two main conditions:\n    1.  If there is a horizontal row composed entirely of a single color other than white (0), that color is the output.\n    2.  If no such solid-colored row exists, the task looks for a row containing exactly two different non-white colors. In such rows, the color that appears less frequently is the output color. The examples suggest that if multiple rows satisfy a condition, the first one encountered (scanning top-to-bottom) determines the output.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
