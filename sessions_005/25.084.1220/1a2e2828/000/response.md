*   **Perception**:
    The task requires analyzing an input grid of colored pixels and producing a 1x1 output grid containing a single color. The input grids vary in size and contain various colored shapes and lines, often against a white (0) background. The output color seems to be determined by examining the horizontal rows of the input grid. There appear to be two main conditions:
    1.  If there is a horizontal row composed entirely of a single color other than white (0), that color is the output.
    2.  If no such solid-colored row exists, the task looks for a row containing exactly two different non-white colors. In such rows, the color that appears less frequently is the output color. The examples suggest that if multiple rows satisfy a condition, the first one encountered (scanning top-to-bottom) determines the output.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: transformation
    input_type: grid
    output_type: grid
    output_dimensions: 1x1
    background_color: 0 # white
    relevant_elements:
      - rows: Horizontal lines of pixels in the input grid.
      - colors: Pixel values (0-9).
    conditions:
      - primary:
          name: monochromatic_non_background_row
          description: A row where all pixels have the same color, and that color is not the background (0).
          action: If found, the output color is the color of this row.
      - secondary:
          name: dichromatic_non_background_row
          description: A row containing exactly two distinct non-background colors (colors other than 0).
          action: If the primary condition is not met anywhere in the grid, and this condition is met, the output color is the one that appears less frequently (minority color) in the first such row found.
    order_of_operations:
      - Check all rows for the primary condition.
      - If primary condition met, determine output and stop.
      - If primary condition not met, check all rows for the secondary condition.
      - If secondary condition met, determine output from the first qualifying row and stop.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Define the background color as white (0).
    2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid from top to bottom.
    3.  For the current row, check if all pixels have the same color and if this color is not the background color.
    4.  If such a row is found, the single color of this row is the result. Create a 1x1 output grid containing this color and terminate the process.
    5.  If no such row is found after checking all rows (i.e., the primary condition is not met), then proceed to the next step.
    6.  Iterate through each row of the input grid again from top to bottom.
    7.  For the current row, identify all unique non-background colors present and count their occurrences.
    8.  Check if there are exactly two distinct non-background colors in the row.
    9.  If a row with exactly two distinct non-background colors is found, determine which of the two colors appears fewer times (the minority color). This minority color is the result. Create a 1x1 output grid containing this color and terminate the process.
    10. (Implicit) If neither condition is met for any row, the transformation logic is undefined based on the provided examples (though this scenario doesn't occur in the training set).
