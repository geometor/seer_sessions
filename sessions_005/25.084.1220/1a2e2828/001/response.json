Identify the first row (from top to bottom) that consists entirely of a single non-background color (color != 0). If such a row exists, the output is a 1x1 grid containing that color.\n2.  If no row satisfies rule 1, identify the first row (from top to bottom) that contains exactly two distinct non-background colors. In this row, find the color that appears less frequently (the minority color).
