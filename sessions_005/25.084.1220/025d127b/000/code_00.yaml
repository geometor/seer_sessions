task_description: "Shift all non-background objects horizontally to the right by one column."

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: "A 2D array of pixels representing colors."
    properties:
      - dimensions: height and width (remain constant)
      - background_color: white (0)

  - element: object
    description: "A contiguous block of pixels with the same non-white color."
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., azure, magenta, red).
      - pixels: A set of (row, column) coordinates defining the object's shape and location.
      - shape: The relative arrangement of pixels (remains constant).
    relationships:
      - may be multiple objects in a grid
      - objects are distinct based on color and/or separation by background pixels

actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    description: "Find all distinct contiguous blocks of non-white pixels in the input grid."
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - list_of_objects (each object containing its color and pixel coordinates)

  - action: shift_object_right
    description: "Translate an object one column to the right."
    inputs:
      - object (color and list of pixel coordinates)
    outputs:
      - shifted_object (color and updated list of pixel coordinates where column index is incremented by 1)
    details:
      - For each pixel (row, col) in the object, the new coordinate becomes (row, col + 1).
      - Pixels shifted beyond the grid's right boundary are discarded.

  - action: reconstruct_grid
    description: "Create the output grid by placing the shifted objects onto a background grid."
    inputs:
      - grid_dimensions
      - background_color
      - list_of_shifted_objects
    outputs:
      - output_grid
    details:
      - Start with a grid of the original dimensions filled with the background color.
      - For each shifted object, place its pixels (with their original color) onto the background grid at their new coordinates. Handle potential overlaps if necessary (though not seen in examples, usually the last object written wins).

transformation_rule: "Identify all non-background objects in the input grid. For each object, shift all of its constituent pixels one column to the right. Reconstruct the output grid using the original dimensions, background color, and the new positions of the shifted objects."
