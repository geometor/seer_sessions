The background color is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Objects**: The grids contain one or more distinct \"objects,\" which are contiguous shapes made of non-white pixels (azure '8' in the first example, magenta '6' and red '2' in the second).\n3.  **Transformation**: When comparing the input and output grids for each example, the core observation is that the non-white objects appear to be shifted horizontally.\n4.  **Shift Direction & Amount**: In both examples, every non-white object is shifted exactly one column to the right. Pixels that would shift beyond the right edge of the grid are simply cut off (though this doesn't happen in these specific examples, it's a potential edge case to consider if the object was near the right edge). Pixels shifting into the first column leave behind white background pixels.\n5.  **Object Integrity**: The shape, color, and relative positions of the pixels within each object remain unchanged during the shift. Only their absolute column position changes.\n6.  **Multiple Objects**: When multiple objects are present (example 2), they all undergo the same independent transformation (shift right by 1 column).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
