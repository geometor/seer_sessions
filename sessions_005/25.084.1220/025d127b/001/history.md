Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure**: Both input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example. The background color is consistently white (0).
2.  **Objects**: The grids contain one or more distinct "objects," which are contiguous shapes made of non-white pixels (azure '8' in the first example, magenta '6' and red '2' in the second).
3.  **Transformation**: When comparing the input and output grids for each example, the core observation is that the non-white objects appear to be shifted horizontally.
4.  **Shift Direction & Amount**: In both examples, every non-white object is shifted exactly one column to the right. Pixels that would shift beyond the right edge of the grid are simply cut off (though this doesn't happen in these specific examples, it's a potential edge case to consider if the object was near the right edge). Pixels shifting into the first column leave behind white background pixels.
5.  **Object Integrity**: The shape, color, and relative positions of the pixels within each object remain unchanged during the shift. Only their absolute column position changes.
6.  **Multiple Objects**: When multiple objects are present (example 2), they all undergo the same independent transformation (shift right by 1 column).

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: "Shift all non-background objects horizontally to the right by one column."

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: "A 2D array of pixels representing colors."
    properties:
      - dimensions: height and width (remain constant)
      - background_color: white (0)

  - element: object
    description: "A contiguous block of pixels with the same non-white color."
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., azure, magenta, red).
      - pixels: A set of (row, column) coordinates defining the object's shape and location.
      - shape: The relative arrangement of pixels (remains constant).
    relationships:
      - may be multiple objects in a grid
      - objects are distinct based on color and/or separation by background pixels

actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    description: "Find all distinct contiguous blocks of non-white pixels in the input grid."
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - list_of_objects (each object containing its color and pixel coordinates)

  - action: shift_object_right
    description: "Translate an object one column to the right."
    inputs:
      - object (color and list of pixel coordinates)
    outputs:
      - shifted_object (color and updated list of pixel coordinates where column index is incremented by 1)
    details:
      - For each pixel (row, col) in the object, the new coordinate becomes (row, col + 1).
      - Pixels shifted beyond the grid's right boundary are discarded.

  - action: reconstruct_grid
    description: "Create the output grid by placing the shifted objects onto a background grid."
    inputs:
      - grid_dimensions
      - background_color
      - list_of_shifted_objects
    outputs:
      - output_grid
    details:
      - Start with a grid of the original dimensions filled with the background color.
      - For each shifted object, place its pixels (with their original color) onto the background grid at their new coordinates. Handle potential overlaps if necessary (though not seen in examples, usually the last object written wins).

transformation_rule: "Identify all non-background objects in the input grid. For each object, shift all of its constituent pixels one column to the right. Reconstruct the output grid using the original dimensions, background color, and the new positions of the shifted objects."
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
3.  If a pixel at `(row, col)` has a non-white color:
    a.  Calculate the target column index as `new_col = col + 1`.
    b.  Check if `new_col` is within the bounds of the grid's width.
    c.  If it is within bounds, set the pixel at `(row, new_col)` in the output grid to the color of the input pixel at `(row, col)`.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
