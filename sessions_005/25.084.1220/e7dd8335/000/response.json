The output grid retains the overall structure and background of the input grid, but modifies the color of some blue pixels within the shape. Specifically, the blue pixels located in the lower portion of the shape's vertical extent are changed to red (2). The division between the unchanged upper portion and the changed lower portion appears to be determined by the vertical midpoint of the blue shape.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
