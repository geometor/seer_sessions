- task: Color Replacement based on Row Template
  examples:
    - input:
        grid_size: [10, 10]
        background_color: 0 # white
        objects:
          - type: template_column
            location: column 0
            colors: [9, 6, 4] # maroon, magenta, yellow
            pixels:
              - { row: 1, col: 0, color: 9 }
              - { row: 2, col: 0, color: 9 }
              - { row: 3, col: 0, color: 6 }
              - { row: 4, col: 0, color: 6 }
              - { row: 5, col: 0, color: 6 }
              - { row: 6, col: 0, color: 4 }
              - { row: 7, col: 0, color: 4 }
              - { row: 8, col: 0, color: 4 }
          - type: target_object
            color: 5 # gray
            pixels: # List of some gray pixel locations
              - { row: 1, col: 5 }
              - { row: 2, col: 5 }
              - { row: 3, col: 4 }
              - { row: 3, col: 5 }
              # ... other gray pixels
      output:
        grid_size: [10, 10]
        background_color: 0 # white
        objects:
          - type: template_column # Unchanged from input
            location: column 0
            colors: [9, 6, 4]
            pixels: # Same as input
              - { row: 1, col: 0, color: 9 }
              # ...
          - type: replaced_object # Derived from target_object
            pixels: # Corresponding output locations for input gray pixels
              - { row: 1, col: 5, color: 9 } # Replaced with color from row 1, col 0
              - { row: 2, col: 5, color: 9 } # Replaced with color from row 2, col 0
              - { row: 3, col: 4, color: 6 } # Replaced with color from row 3, col 0
              - { row: 3, col: 5, color: 6 } # Replaced with color from row 3, col 0
              # ... other replaced pixels
      relationship: The color of a gray (5) pixel in the input grid is replaced by the color found in column 0 of the same row in the input grid. All other pixels retain their original color.
    - input: # Second example similar structure
        grid_size: [10, 10]
        background_color: 0
        objects:
          - type: template_column
            location: column 0
            colors: [8, 2] # azure, red
          - type: target_object
            color: 5 # gray
      output:
        grid_size: [10, 10]
        background_color: 0
        objects:
          - type: template_column # Unchanged
            location: column 0
            colors: [8, 2]
          - type: replaced_object # Derived from target_object, colors based on template_column and row index
      relationship: Same relationship applies.
  general_rule:
    action: Replace color
    source_pixels: Pixels with color 5 (gray).
    target_pixels: Same locations as source_pixels.
    replacement_logic: For each gray pixel at (row, col), find the color of the pixel at (row, 0) in the input grid. Use this color as the replacement color for the output pixel at (row, col).
    unchanged_pixels: All non-gray pixels maintain their original color and position.
