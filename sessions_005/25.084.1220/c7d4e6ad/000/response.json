            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are 10x10. The primary background color is white (0).\n2.  **Input Objects:**\n    *   There are distinct colored objects located exclusively in the first column (column 0). These objects have different colors (maroon, magenta, yellow in the first example; azure, red in the second).\n    *   There is another object composed entirely of gray (5) pixels, located elsewhere in the grid, separate from the objects in the first column.\n3.  **Output Objects:**\n    *   The colored objects in the first column remain unchanged in the output grid.\n    *   The gray object from the input grid is no longer present in the output grid.\n    *   The locations previously occupied by the gray pixels are now filled with colors. These colors match the colors found in the first column *on the corresponding row*.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves replacing gray pixels. The replacement color for a gray pixel is determined by the color present in the first column (column 0) of the same row where the gray pixel was located. All other pixels (white background and the objects in the first column) are preserved.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
