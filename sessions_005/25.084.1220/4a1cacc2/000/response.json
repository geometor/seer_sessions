This single pixel acts as the key element determining the transformation. The color of this pixel varies (yellow, maroon, magenta).\n3.  **Output Object:** The output grid is the same size as the input grid and retains the azure (8) background. A solid rectangle, colored the same as the unique input pixel, is drawn in one of the four corners of the output grid.\n4.  **Transformation Logic:** The position of the single unique pixel in the input grid determines both the *location* (which corner) and the *size* (height and width) of the rectangle in the output grid.\n5.  **Quadrant Calculation:** The position (R, C) of the unique input pixel effectively divides the grid into four quadrants relative to that pixel. The dimensions of these quadrants are:\n    *   Top-Left: (R+1) x (C+1)\n    *   Top-Right: (R+1) x (Grid Width - C)\n    *   Bottom-Left: (Grid Height - R) x (C+1)\n    *   Bottom-Right: (Grid Height - R) x (Grid Width - C)\n6.  **Smallest Quadrant Rule:** The transformation identifies the quadrant with the *smallest area* among these four. The output rectangle's color, corner location, and dimensions correspond to this smallest quadrant.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Scan the input grid to find the single pixel that is not azure (8). Record its color (`source_color`) and its location (row `R`, column `C`).\n3.  Get the height (`H`) and width (`W`) of the grid.\n4.  Calculate the dimensions and areas of the four rectangular regions (quadrants) defined by the pixel at (`R`, `C`):\n    *   `top_left_dims` = (`R` + 1, `C` + 1), `area_TL` = (`R` + 1) * (`C` + 1)\n    *   `top_right_dims` = (`R` + 1, `W` - `C`), `area_TR` = (`R` + 1) * (`W` - `C`)\n    *   `bottom_left_dims` = (`H` - `R`, `C` + 1), `area_BL` = (`H` - `R`) * (`C` + 1)\n    *   `bottom_right_dims` = (`H` - `R`, `W` - `C`), `area_BR` = (`H` - `R`) * (`W` - `C`)\n5.  Identify which of the four areas (`area_TL`, `area_TR`, `area_BL`, `area_BR`) is the smallest.\n6.  Based on the smallest area, determine the target corner and the dimensions (`target_height`, `target_width`) for the output rectangle:\n    *   If `area_TL` is smallest: Target corner is top-left, (`target_height`, `target_width`) = `top_left_dims`.\n    *   If `area_TR` is smallest: Target corner is top-right, (`target_height`, `target_width`) = `top_right_dims`.\n    *   If `area_BL` is smallest: Target corner is bottom-left, (`target_height`, `target_width`) = `bottom_left_dims`.\n    *   If `area_BR` is smallest: Target corner is bottom-right, (`target_height`, `target_width`) = `bottom_right_dims`.\n    *   (Note: Handle potential ties, although not present in examples, consistently choosing one, e.g., TL > TR > BL > BR priority).\n7.  Fill the pixels in the target corner of the output grid with the `source_color`. The region to fill starts at row 0 for top corners or row `H - target_height` for bottom corners, and column 0 for left corners or column `W - target_width` for right corners, extending for `target_height` rows and `target_width` columns."
