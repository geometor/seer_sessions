Okay, I will analyze the task examples and provide the requested deliverables.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The input is always a 4x4 grid of colored pixels. The output is always an 8x8 grid.
2.  **Output Composition:** The 8x8 output grid appears to be composed of four distinct 4x4 subgrids arranged in a 2x2 pattern.
3.  **Subgrid Relationship to Input:** Each 4x4 subgrid in the output seems to be a transformed version of the original 4x4 input grid.
4.  **Transformations:** By comparing the input to each quadrant of the output across multiple examples, specific geometric transformations (rotations) are consistently applied:
    *   The top-left quadrant is identical to the input.
    *   The top-right quadrant is the input rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
    *   The bottom-left quadrant is the input rotated 180 degrees.
    *   The bottom-right quadrant is the input rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
5.  **Colors:** The colors themselves are preserved during the transformations; only their positions change according to the rotation rules.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
input_grid:
  properties:
    - type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
    - dimensions: fixed 4x4
    - values: integers 0-9 representing colors
output_grid:
  properties:
    - type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
    - dimensions: fixed 8x8
    - values: integers 0-9 representing colors
composition:
  output_grid: composed of four 4x4 subgrids (quadrants) arranged in a 2x2 layout
transformation_rule:
  - quadrant: top-left (rows 0-3, cols 0-3)
    source: input_grid
    action: identity (no transformation)
  - quadrant: top-right (rows 0-3, cols 4-7)
    source: input_grid
    action: rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise
  - quadrant: bottom-left (rows 4-7, cols 0-3)
    source: input_grid
    action: rotate 180 degrees
  - quadrant: bottom-right (rows 4-7, cols 4-7)
    source: input_grid
    action: rotate 90 degrees clockwise
relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions are double the input grid dimensions in both height and width.
  - Each quadrant of the output grid is derived solely from the input grid via a specific rotation.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the 4x4 input grid.
2.  Create a new, empty 8x8 output grid.
3.  Determine the dimensions of the input grid (Height H = 4, Width W = 4).
4.  **Fill Top-Left Quadrant:** Copy the input grid directly into the output grid at coordinates (row 0, col 0) to (row H-1, col W-1).
5.  **Fill Top-Right Quadrant:** Rotate the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Place this rotated grid into the output grid at coordinates (row 0, col W) to (row H-1, col 2*W-1).
6.  **Fill Bottom-Left Quadrant:** Rotate the input grid 180 degrees. Place this rotated grid into the output grid at coordinates (row H, col 0) to (row 2*H-1, col W-1).
7.  **Fill Bottom-Right Quadrant:** Rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise. Place this rotated grid into the output grid at coordinates (row H, col W) to (row 2*H-1, col 2*W-1).
8.  Return the completed 8x8 output grid.
