## General Assessment

The provided Python code successfully solves examples 2 and 3 but fails on example 1. The failure report indicates that 8 pixels are incorrect in the transformed output for example 1, although the size and color properties are correct. This suggests the overall structure (tiling a 4x4 grid with transformed 3x3 inputs) is correct, but one or more of the specific geometric transformations applied to the quadrants are wrong or inconsistent across examples.

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-examine the input-output pairs for all examples, focusing on the transformation applied to each of the four quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).
2.  Identify the correct transformation for each quadrant that holds true for all training examples.
3.  Pay close attention to example 1, where the previous code failed, to pinpoint the incorrect transformation. The code execution confirms the Bottom-Left quadrant transformation was incorrect.
4.  Update the documented facts and natural language program to reflect the universally correct transformations.

## Metrics and Analysis

Based on the previous execution results and further analysis using `tool_code`:

*   **Input/Output Size:** All examples use a 3x3 input grid and produce a 12x12 output grid (4 times the input dimensions).
*   **Tiling Structure:** The output grid is consistently formed by tiling transformed versions of the input grid in a 4x4 pattern (meaning each transformed input occupies a 3x3 block, and there are 16 such blocks total).
*   **Quadrant Transformations (Confirmed):**
    *   **Top-Left Quadrant (Tiles [0:2, 0:2]):** The input grid is rotated 180 degrees (`np.rot90(k=2)`). This holds for all examples.
    *   **Top-Right Quadrant (Tiles [0:2, 2:4]):** The input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise (`np.rot90(k=-1)`). This holds for all examples.
    *   **Bottom-Left Quadrant (Tiles [2:4, 0:2]):**
        *   Previous code used: Vertical Flip (`np.flipud`).
        *   Analysis of Example 1 Expected Output shows: Rotation 90 degrees counter-clockwise (`np.rot90(k=1)`) is required.
        *   Checking Examples 2 & 3: Let's verify if Rot 90 CCW also works for them.
            *   Example 2 Input: `[[6, 8, 8], [8, 6, 8], [8, 8, 8]]` -> Rot 90 CCW: `[[8, 8, 8], [8, 6, 8], [6, 8, 8]]`. Expected BL tile: `[[8, 8, 8], [8, 6, 8], [6, 8, 8]]`. Matches.
            *   Example 3 Input: `[[1, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8]]` -> Rot 90 CCW: `[[8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [1, 8, 8]]`. Expected BL tile: `[[8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [1, 8, 8]]`. Matches.
        *   Conclusion: The correct transformation for the Bottom-Left quadrant is Rotation 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
    *   **Bottom-Right Quadrant (Tiles [2:4, 2:4]):** The input grid is used as is (Identity transformation). This holds for all examples.
*   **Error Analysis (Example 1):**
    *   The previous code generated an output that differed from the expected output by exactly 8 pixels.
    *   These differing pixels were located exclusively within the 4 tiles that constitute the Bottom-Left quadrant of the output grid.
    *   Comparing the expected Bottom-Left tile (`np.rot90(input, k=1)`) with the generated Bottom-Left tile (`np.flipud(input)`) for Example 1 reveals exactly 2 differing pixels per 3x3 tile.
    *   Since there are 4 such tiles in the Bottom-Left quadrant, the total difference is 2 * 4 = 8 pixels, matching the report.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Take the 3x3 input grid.
2.  Create a target 12x12 output grid, initialized empty (e.g., with white pixels).
3.  Mentally divide the 12x12 output grid into a 4x4 grid of 3x3 tiles.
4.  Define four transformed versions of the input grid:
    a.  `version_TL`: Input grid rotated 180 degrees.
    b.  `version_TR`: Input grid rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
    c.  `version_BL`: Input grid rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
    d.  `version_BR`: Input grid unchanged (identity).
5.  Iterate through the 4x4 tile positions in the output grid (using tile row index `tr` from 0 to 3 and tile column index `tc` from 0 to 3).
6.  For each tile position (`tr`, `tc`), determine which quadrant it belongs to:
    a.  If `tr < 2` and `tc < 2` (Top-Left quadrant), use `version_TL`.
    b.  If `tr < 2` and `tc >= 2` (Top-Right quadrant), use `version_TR`.
    c.  If `tr >= 2` and `tc < 2` (Bottom-Left quadrant), use `version_BL`.
    d.  If `tr >= 2` and `tc >= 2` (Bottom-Right quadrant), use `version_BR`.
7.  Calculate the starting row (`r_start = tr * 3`) and column (`c_start = tc * 3`) in the output grid for the current tile.
8.  Place the selected transformed version of the input grid into the 3x3 block at `output_grid[r_start:r_start+3, c_start:c_start+3]`.
9.  Return the completed 12x12 output grid.
