derived_rules_summary:
  - Find target color: Red(2) if present, else Green(3).
  - If no target color found, return input.
  - Calculate Manhattan distance 'd' for each pixel to the nearest target pixel.
  - Apply color transformation based on target color, input color 'I', distance 'd', and sometimes coordinates '(r, c)'.
  - Example 1 (Red Target) Rules for Yellow(4): Need significant revision. The previous distance-based rules are largely incorrect based on the error analysis. A new pattern must be identified.
  - Example 2 (Green Target) Rules for White(0): Transformations depend on distance 'd' and seem related to horizontal position (column 'c') relative to the Green pixels. Left side tends towards Green(3), right side tends towards Yellow(4). Rules for d=2, d=3, d=4 need refinement based on error analysis. Yellow(4) remains invariant. Maroon(9) remains invariant.
