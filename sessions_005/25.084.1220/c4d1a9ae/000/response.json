Find the Red (2) pixels.\n2.  Calculate the minimum Manhattan distance `d` from each pixel to any Red pixel.\n3.  If the input pixel color is NOT Yellow (4), the output color is the same as the input color.\n4.  If the input pixel color IS Yellow (4), the output color is determined by the distance `d`:\n    - If `d = 1`: Output is Magenta (6) OR Yellow (4). Needs refinement.\n    - If `d = 2`: Output is Gray (5).\n    - If `d = 3`: Output is Gray (5).\n    - If `d = 4`: Output is Yellow (4).\n    - If `d = 5`: Output is Red (2).\n    - If `d >= 6`: (Not applicable for Yellow pixels in this example) -> Assume Yellow (4)?\n\nWhat distinguishes Yellow at `(0,0)` (d=1 -> out=6) from Yellow at `(0,2)` (d=1 -> out=4)?\n- `(0,0)` neighbors: R(0,1), Y(1,0). Col 0.\n- `(0,2)` neighbors: R(0,1), Y(0,3), Y(1,2). Col 2.\n\nMaybe the column index still matters?\nRule refinement for Yellow (4) input:\n- If `d=1` AND (`c=0` or `c=1`): Output Magenta (6).\n- If `d=1` AND (`c=2`): Output Yellow (4).\n- If `d=2` (`c=3`): Output Gray (5).\n- If `d=3` (`c=4`): Output Gray (5).\n- If `d=4` (`c=5`): Output Yellow (4).\n- If `d=5` (`c=6`): Output Red (2).\n- Otherwise (for Yellow pixels): Output Yellow (4).\n\nThis looks very specific to Train 1 again.\n\nCould the target color be identified dynamically?\n- Train 1: Colors are {2, 4, 5, 6}. Red (2) seems plausible as a target.\n- Train 2: Colors are {0, 3, 4, 9}. Green (3) seems plausible. Maybe Yellow (4)? Let's check distances to Yellow (4) in Train 2.\n"

The predicted output is very different from the actual output for Train 2.\n\nLet's return to the first hypothesis for **Train 1**:\nRule:\n1. Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.\n2. Get the input color `in_color = input[r, c]`.\n3. If `in_color` is NOT Yellow (4), the output color is `in_color`.\n4. If `in_color` IS Yellow (4), the output color depends on the column index `c`:\n    - If `c == 0` or `c == 1`, output Magenta (6).\n    - If `c == 3` or `c == 4`, output Gray (5).\n    - If `c == 6`, output Red (2).\n    - Otherwise (if `c == 2`, `c == 5`, `c == 7`), output Yellow (4).\n\nThis rule perfectly reproduces `train_1`. Now, let's try to find an analogous rule for `train_2`.\n\n**Train 2 Hypothesis:** Maybe there's a \"target\" color (Green=3?) and a \"default/background\" color (White=0?), and other colors get transformed based on some property?\n\nLook at the transformations in Train 2:\n- White (0) -> Can become Green (3), White (0), Maroon (9), Yellow (4).\n- Yellow (4) -> Can become Yellow (4), Green (3).\n- Green (3) -> Stays Green (3).\n- Maroon (9) -> Can become Maroon (9), Yellow (4).\n\nThis suggests Green (3) is special (it's invariant and other colors can become it).\nWhite (0) also seems special (it's the background, and other colors don't seem to become White, except White itself in some places).\n\nMaybe the rule is based on coordinates relative to the Green pixels?\n\nConsider the transformation `I -> O`:\n- `I(0,0)=0 -> O(0,0)=3`\n- `I(0,3)=0 -> O(0,3)=0`\n- `I(0,4)=0 -> O(0,4)=9`\n- `I(1,0)=4 -> O(1,0)=4`\n- `I(1,1)=0 -> O(1,1)=3`\n- `I(1,4)=3 -> O(1,4)=3`\n- `I(1,6)=9 -> O(1,6)=9`\n- `I(1,7)=0 -> O(1,7)=4`\n- `I(2,1)=4 -> O(2,1)=4`\n- `I(3,7)=9 -> O(3,7)=9`\n\nThis is not leading anywhere clear. Let's assume the Train 1 rule is the correct type: A color substitution based on location or context, potentially focused on one primary color being changed.\n\n**Train 1 Summary:** Yellow (4) pixels change color based *only* on their column index. Other colors are unchanged.\n\n**Train 2 Analysis:**\n- Colors: 0, 3, 4, 9.\n- Does one color change based on column index?\n    - Yellow (4): Changes to 3 sometimes (e.g., (3,2)->(3,2)=4, (7,2)->(7,2)=4, but (1,0)->(1,0)=4, (2,1)->(2,1)=4). No clear column rule.\n    - White (0): Changes to 3, 9, 4. Highly variable.\n    - Maroon (9): Changes to 4 sometimes (e.g., (1,7)->4, (3,7)->4, (5,7)->4, (7,7)->4). This looks interesting!\n        - Maroon pixels are at `(r, 7)` and `(r, 6)` for some `r`.\n        - Input `I(r, 7)` is 9. Output `O(r, 7)` is 9 or 4.\n        - Input `I(r, 6)` is 9 (only at r=1, 4, 7). Output `O(r, 6)` is 9 or 4.\n        - Output at `(r, 7)`: 9 4 9 4 9 4 9 4 9 4 (Alternating 9 and 4)\n        - Output at `(r, 6)`: 4 9 4 4 9 4 4 9 4 4 (Matches Input col 6 mostly?) No, col 6 input is 0 except for the 9s. Let's check (1,6), (4,6), (7,6).\n            - I(1,6)=9 -> O(1,6)=9\n            - I(4,6)=9 -> O(4,6)=9\n            - I(7,6)=9 -> O(7,6)=9\n        - So, Maroon(9) at `(r, 6)` doesn't change. Maroon(9) at `(r, 7)` changes to 4 if `r` is odd, stays 9 if `r` is even.\n\nLet's propose a rule for Train 2 based on this:\n1. Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)`.\n2. Get `in_color = input[r, c]`.\n3. If `in_color == 9` (Maroon) AND `c == 7`:\n    - If `r` is odd, output 4 (Yellow).\n    - If `r` is even, output 9 (Maroon).\n4. Else (if not Maroon at col 7): output `in_color`.\n\nLet's test this partial rule on Train 2:\nInput:\n"

No, the general structure is similar.\n\nCould it be related to unique neighbors?\n- Pixel `(r, c)`. Look at its 8 neighbors. How many unique colors are there among the neighbors?\n- **Train 1:** Pixel `(0,0)`=4. Neighbors: (0,1)=2, (1,1)=4, (1,0)=2. Unique neighbors: {2, 4}. Count = 2. Output = 6.\n- Pixel `(0,2)`=4.

Output = 2.\n\nRule for Yellow (4) based on unique neighbor count `N` and the set of neighbor colors `S`:\n- N=2, S={2, 4} -> Output 6 (if c=0,1) or 4 (if c=2).\n- N=2, S={4, 6} -> Output 5.\n- N=2, S={4, 5} -> Output 2.\n\nThis doesn't seem simpler.\n\nLet's revisit the initial analysis of Train 1. The rule based purely on the column index of Yellow pixels worked perfectly. It's simple and deterministic. It feels like the intended solution for that pair.\nWhy would Train 2 be so different?\n\nCould Train 1's rule be described differently?\nOutput colors for Yellow pixels: 6, 6, 4, 5, 5, 4, 2, 4. (Based on columns 0..7).\nIs there a pattern? 6 -> 6 -> 4 -> 5 -> 5 -> 4 -> 2 -> 4.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"distance to nearest special color\" idea, but maybe the output color isn't directly the distance, but chosen *from* a palette based on distance?\n\n**Train 1:** Target=Red(2). Palette={Magenta(6), Yellow(4), Gray(5), Red(2)}.\nDistances `d`: 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ...\nIf input is Yellow(4):\n- d=1 -> Output is Magenta(6) or Yellow(4).\n- d=2 -> Output is Gray(5).\n- d=3 -> Output is Gray(5).\n- d=4 -> Output is Yellow(4).\n- d=5 -> Output is Red(2).\n\n**Train 2:** Target=Green(3). Palette={Green(3), White(0), Maroon(9), Yellow(4)}.\nDistances `d`: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ...\nMappings `(d, I) -> O`:\n- (0, 3) -> 3\n- (1, 0) -> 0 or 9\n- (1, 3) -> does not exist\n- (1, 4) -> does not exist\n- (1, 9) -> does not exist\n- (2, 0) -> 0 or 3\n- (2, 4) -> 4\n- (2, 9) -> 9\n- (3, 0) -> 3 or 4\n- (3, 4) -> 4\n- (3, 9) -> 9\n- (4, 0) -> 3 or 4\n- (4, 4) -> 4\n- (4, 9) -> 9\n- (5, 0) -> 3\n- (5, 4) -> does not exist\n- (5, 9) -> does not exist\n\nThis confirms the transformation in Train 2 is complex and depends on both distance `d` (to nearest Green) and the original color `I`, and potentially something else (like coordinates or neighbors) to resolve ambiguities (e.g., where `(d=1, I=0)` gives `O=0` vs `O=9`).\n\nGiven the dreamer's role is to find the \"story\", the simple column-based rule for Train 1 seems like a good candidate *if it generalizes*. But it clearly doesn't generalize to Train 2 in any obvious way.\n\nThe \"distance to nearest X\" idea seems more promising as a general concept, even if the exact mapping is complex. Let's assume this is the underlying principle for both.\n\n**Refined Perception:**\nBoth examples seem to involve:\n1. Identifying a 'special' or 'target' color within the input grid (Red=2 in Ex1, Green=3 in Ex2).\n2. Calculating the Manhattan distance from every pixel to the nearest pixel of the target color.\n3. Determining the output color based on a rule involving this calculated distance and the original color of the pixel. The exact rule seems complex and differs between the examples.\n\n**Train 1 Rule (Distance-based):**\n- Target color: Red (2).\n- For each pixel `(r, c)` with input color `I` and distance `d` to nearest Red:\n    - If `I != 4` (Yellow), `Output = I`.\n    - If `I == 4` (Yellow):\n        - If `d == 1` AND `c <= 1`, `Output = 6` (Magenta).\n        - If `d == 1` AND `c == 2`, `Output = 4` (Yellow).\n        - If `d == 2` OR `d == 3`, `Output = 5` (Gray).\n        - If `d == 4`, `Output = 4` (Yellow).\n        - If `d == 5`, `Output = 2` (Red).\n        - Otherwise (d=0 or d>=6), `Output = 4` (Yellow). (Red(d=0) pixels are handled by the first rule).\n\n**Train 2 Rule (Distance-based):**\n- Target color: Green (3).\n- For each pixel `(r, c)` with input color `I` and distance `d` to nearest Green:\n    - The output color `O` is a function `O = f(d, I, r, c)`. The exact function `f` is complex. We can observe the mapping from the example, but deriving a simple rule is hard.\n        - e.g., `f(d=0, I=3, r, c) = 3`\n        - e.g., `f(d=1, I=0, r, c)` depends on location: `0` if `c=3` or `c=5`, `9` if `c=4`.\n        - e.g., `f(d=2, I=4, r, c) = 4`\n        - e.g., `f(d=4, I=9, r, c) = 9`\n\nThis distance-based approach provides a *potential* unifying story, although the details differ significantly. The simple column-based rule for Train 1 is cleaner but lacks an obvious connection to Train 2.\n\nFor the dreamer phase, I should probably describe the distance-based perception as it seems more fundamental and applicable (even if complex) to both.\n\n**YAML Facts Structure:**\n- `task_type`: Color transformation based on proximity.\n- `target_color_identification`: Seems to be a color present in the input, possibly non-background, non-dominant? (Red=2 in Ex1, Green=3 in Ex2).\n- `distance_metric`: Manhattan.\n- `transformation_logic`: Output color depends on `(distance_to_target, input_color, coordinates?)`.\n- `invariant_colors`: Target color seems invariant (`Red->Red` if `d=0`, `Green->Green` if `d=0`). Other colors may be invariant under certain conditions (e.g., `Maroon->Maroon` if `d>=2` in Ex2).\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n1. Identify the 'target' color in the input grid. This seems to be Red (2) in the first example and Green (3) in the second. (Need a general rule for finding this - maybe a color that forms specific patterns or has a certain frequency?).\n2. For every pixel location `(r, c)` in the grid:\n    a. Find the minimum Manhattan distance `d` to the nearest pixel containing the 'target' color.\n    b. Get the color `I` of the input pixel at `(r, c)`.\n    c. Determine the output color `O` based on `d`, `I`, and possibly the coordinates `(r, c)`.\n3. The specific rules for determining `O` from `(d, I, r, c)` vary between examples and seem complex, mapping specific combinations to output colors.\n\nThis feels like a reasonable summary of the perception and logic, acknowledging the complexity in the final step.Okay, analyzing the provided examples (`train_1` and `train_2`), here's my perception of the task, the documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: Both examples operate on 10x8 grids. The transformation preserves the grid dimensions.\n2.  **Colors**:\n    *   Example 1 uses Yellow (4), Red (2), Magenta (6), Gray (5).\n    *   Example 2 uses White (0), Yellow (4), Green (3), Maroon (9).\n    *   The output grids contain the same set of colors as their respective inputs, but the colors are rearranged or substituted.\n3.  **Patterns & Transformations**:\n    *   **Example 1**: The input has distinct vertical patterns (alternating colors, solid colors, blocks). The output shows changes primarily to the Yellow (4) pixels. The change applied to a Yellow pixel seems dependent on its column index. Pixels of other colors (Red, Magenta, Gray) remain unchanged.\n    *   **Example 2**: The input has a White (0) background with scattered Green (3) and Yellow (4) pixels, plus Maroon (9) pixels forming parts of vertical lines near the right edge. The output shows significant changes across the grid. White pixels change to various colors, Yellow pixels change to Green or stay Yellow, and Maroon pixels remain Maroon. Green pixels also remain Green. The transformation appears more complex than in Example 1.\n4.  **Potential Underlying Logic**: A possible unifying theme involves proximity. It appears that a 'target' color might be identified in each input (perhaps Red in Ex1, Green in Ex2). The transformation of *other* pixels could then depend on their Manhattan distance to the nearest instance of this target color.\n    *   In Example 1, if the target is Red(2), the transformation rule for Yellow(4) pixels maps distances {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} to output colors {6/4, 5, 5, 4, 2}, with some ambiguity at d=1 potentially resolved by column index. Non-Yellow pixels are unchanged.\n    *   In Example 2, if the target is Green(3), the transformation rule seems to depend on both the distance `d` *and* the original input color `I`. Green(3) itself is invariant (d=0). Other mappings like `(d=1, I=0) -> 0` or `9`, `(d=2, I=4) -> 4`, `(d=4, I=9) -> 9`, etc., suggest a complex lookup or function based on `(d, I)` and possibly coordinates.\n\n## Documented Facts\n\n"
