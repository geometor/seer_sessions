One distinct object is a straight line (either horizontal or vertical) made of red pixels, always located along one of the grid edges. The other objects are composed of various non-white, non-red colors. The transformation involves moving these non-red objects towards the red line until they become adjacent to it. The red line itself remains stationary. The space vacated by the moving objects becomes white.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
