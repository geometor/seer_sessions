    Combines the left and right halves of an input grid based on a color rule,

    The input grid is assumed to have a vertical blue line (color 1) separating
    two sections containing only white (0) and yellow (4) pixels. 
    The output grid has the dimensions of one of these sections.
    For each cell in the output grid, its color is determined by the 
    corresponding cells in the left and right sections of the input:
    - If either the left or right corresponding cell is yellow (4), the output cell is azure (8).
