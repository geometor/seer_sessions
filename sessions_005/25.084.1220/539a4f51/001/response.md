"""
Transforms an input grid into an output grid that is twice the height and twice the width. 
The output grid is composed of four quadrants. 
The top-left quadrant is a copy of the original input grid. 
The other three quadrants (top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) are copies of a 'modified grid'.
The 'modified grid' is created by taking the input grid and replacing all white pixels (color 0) with the color of the top-left pixel (0, 0) of the input grid.
