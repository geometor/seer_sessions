**Perception**

The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid that is twice the height and twice the width of the input. The output grid appears to be composed of four quadrants, each the size of the original input grid.

Observing the examples:
1.  The output grid dimensions are consistently double the input grid dimensions (e.g., 5x5 input -> 10x10 output).
2.  The output grid is formed by placing four grids together in a 2x2 arrangement.
3.  The top-left quadrant of the output grid is always an exact copy of the original input grid.
4.  The other three quadrants (top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) appear to be derived from the input grid, but with a specific modification.
5.  By comparing the top-left (original input) quadrant with the other quadrants in each example, the modification seems to involve replacing the white pixels (color 0).
6.  The color used to replace the white pixels is consistently the color found at the top-left corner (index 0, 0) of the original input grid.
    *   In `train_1`, input[0,0] is blue (1). The white pixels (0) in the input are replaced by blue (1) in the other three quadrants of the output.
    *   In `train_2`, input[0,0] is red (2). The white pixels (0) in the input are replaced by red (2) in the other three quadrants of the output.
    *   In `train_3`, input[0,0] is red (2). There are no white pixels (0) in the input. Consequently, the "modified" grid is identical to the original input grid, and all four quadrants of the output are copies of the input grid.

Therefore, the transformation rule involves creating a modified version of the input grid where white pixels are replaced by the color of the top-left pixel, and then tiling the original input and the modified grid into a larger 2x2 output grid.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: Grid Transformation

input_grid:
  properties:
    - dimensions: H rows, W columns (variable, e.g., 5x5)
    - content: Pixels with colors 0-9
  key_elements:
    - top_left_pixel: The pixel at coordinates (0, 0)
    - white_pixels: Pixels with color value 0

output_grid:
  properties:
    - dimensions: 2H rows, 2W columns
    - structure: Composed of four quadrants, each HxW
  quadrants:
    - top_left: Copy of the original input_grid
    - top_right: Copy of the modified_grid
    - bottom_left: Copy of the modified_grid
    - bottom_right: Copy of the modified_grid

derived_elements:
  - fill_color: The color of the top_left_pixel of the input_grid
  - modified_grid:
      derivation: A copy of the input_grid where every white_pixel (color 0) is replaced by the fill_color.

actions:
  - Determine: Get the dimensions (H, W) of the input_grid.
  - Identify: Get the fill_color from input_grid[0, 0].
  - Create: Generate the modified_grid by replacing white pixels in the input_grid with the fill_color.
  - Assemble: Construct the output_grid (2H x 2W) by placing the input_grid in the top-left quadrant and the modified_grid in the other three quadrants.

relationships:
  - Output dimensions are double the input dimensions.
  - The content of the output's top-left quadrant is identical to the input grid.
  - The content of the output's other three quadrants depends on the input grid and the fill_color.
  - The modification rule specifically targets white pixels (color 0).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the height `H` and width `W` of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions `2H` rows and `2W` columns.
3.  Identify the color of the pixel at the top-left corner (row 0, column 0) of the input grid. Call this `fill_color`.
4.  Create a temporary "modified grid" of size `H` x `W`.
5.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at coordinates `(r, c)` from `(0, 0)` to `(H-1, W-1)`:
    a.  If the pixel color is white (0), set the corresponding pixel in the modified grid at `(r, c)` to `fill_color`.
    b.  Otherwise (if the pixel color is not white), set the corresponding pixel in the modified grid at `(r, c)` to the same color as the input grid's pixel at `(r, c)`.
6.  Copy the original input grid into the top-left quadrant of the output grid (rows `0` to `H-1`, columns `0` to `W-1`).
7.  Copy the modified grid into the top-right quadrant of the output grid (rows `0` to `H-1`, columns `W` to `2W-1`).
8.  Copy the modified grid into the bottom-left quadrant of the output grid (rows `H` to `2H-1`, columns `0` to `W-1`).
9.  Copy the modified grid into the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid (rows `H` to `2H-1`, columns `W` to `2W-1`).
10. Return the final output grid.
