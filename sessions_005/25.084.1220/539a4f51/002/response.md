Okay, the code execution confirms my suspicion. The previous interpretation was wrong. The structure isn't just `[Input, Modified; Modified, Modified]`.

Let's analyze the quadrants for Example 1 based on the code execution:
*   **Expected TL:** Matches the "Modified Grid" (Input with white replaced by top-left color).
*   **Expected TR:** Doesn't match Input or Modified Grid.
*   **Expected BL:** Doesn't match Input or Modified Grid.
*   **Expected BR:** Doesn't match Input or Modified Grid.

This means the rule is more complex than previously thought. Let's re-examine the relationship between the input and the expected output quadrants.

Input Grid (I):

```
1 1 4 6 0
1 1 4 6 0
4 4 4 6 0
6 6 6 6 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

Modified Grid (M - replace 0 with top-left=1):

```
1 1 4 6 1
1 1 4 6 1
4 4 4 6 1
6 6 6 6 1
1 1 1 1 1
```


Expected Output Quadrants:
TL:

```
1 1 4 6 1  (Matches M)
1 1 4 6 1
4 4 4 6 1
6 6 6 6 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

TR:

```
1 4 6 1 1
1 4 6 1 1
1 4 6 1 1
1 4 6 1 1
1 4 6 1 1
```

BL:

```
1 1 1 1 1
4 4 4 4 4
6 6 6 6 6
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

BR:

```
1 4 6 1 1
4 4 6 1 1
6 6 6 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
```


Hypothesis: Maybe the quadrants are transformations of the *modified* grid?
Let's compare TR, BL, BR to M.

*   TR vs M: Not obviously related (e.g., rotation, flip).
*   BL vs M: Not obviously related.
*   BR vs M: Not obviously related.

Let's compare TR, BL, BR to the *original* Input (I).
*   TR vs I: Not obviously related.
*   BL vs I: Not obviously related.
*   BR vs I: Not obviously related.

Let's consider geometric transformations.
*   Flip M horizontally:
    
```
    1 6 4 1 1
    1 6 4 1 1
    1 6 4 4 4
    1 6 6 6 6
    1 1 1 1 1
    ```

    Doesn't match TR, BL, or BR.
*   Flip M vertically:
    
```
    1 1 1 1 1
    6 6 6 6 1
    4 4 4 6 1
    1 1 4 6 1
    1 1 4 6 1
    ```

    Doesn't match TR, BL, or BR.
*   Transpose M:
    
```
    1 1 4 6 1
    1 1 4 6 1
    4 4 4 6 1
    6 6 6 6 1
    1 1 1 1 1
    ```

    Same as M (it's symmetric along the diagonal except for the bottom right corner element). Doesn't help.

Let's look at the structure again.
Output size is 2H x 2W.
TL quadrant is the modified grid M.
What about the others?

Let's consider TR:

```
1 4 6 1 1
1 4 6 1 1
1 4 6 1 1
1 4 6 1 1
1 4 6 1 1
```

Compare to M:

```
1 1 4 6 1
1 1 4 6 1
4 4 4 6 1
6 6 6 6 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

The first column of TR is all 1s. The first column of M is `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`.
The second column of TR is all 4s. The second column of M is `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`.
This doesn't seem right.

Let's look at BL:

```
1 1 1 1 1
4 4 4 4 4
6 6 6 6 6
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Compare to M:

```
1 1 4 6 1
1 1 4 6 1
4 4 4 6 1
6 6 6 6 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

The first row of BL is all 1s. The first row of M is `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`.
The second row of BL is all 4s. The second row of M is `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`.
The third row of BL is all 6s. The third row of M is `[4, 4, 4, 6, 1]`.
The fourth row of BL is all 1s. The fourth row of M is `[6, 6, 6, 6, 1]`.
The fifth row of BL is all 1s. The fifth row of M is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.

This looks like a pattern! For BL, row `r` seems to be filled with the color from M at `(r, 0)` (the first column of M). Let's check:
M col 0: `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`
BL row 0: all 1s. Matches M[0,0]=1.
BL row 1: all 4s. Doesn't match M[1,0]=1. Ah, maybe it's related to the *rows* of M?
M row 0: `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`
M row 1: `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`
M row 2: `[4, 4, 4, 6, 1]`
M row 3: `[6, 6, 6, 6, 1]`
M row 4: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

Let's try this rule for BL: Fill row `r` of BL with the color `M[r, 0]`.
Row 0: Fill with M[0,0] = 1. -> `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Matches BL row 0.
Row 1: Fill with M[1,0] = 1. -> `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Doesn't match BL row 1 (`[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`).

Maybe it's the color at `M[r, r]`? (Diagonal)
M diag: `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`
Row 0: Fill with M[0,0]=1 -> `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Matches BL row 0.
Row 1: Fill with M[1,1]=1 -> `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Doesn't match BL row 1 (`[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`).

Let's reconsider BL:

```
1 1 1 1 1  <- Row 0
4 4 4 4 4  <- Row 1
6 6 6 6 6  <- Row 2
1 1 1 1 1  <- Row 3
1 1 1 1 1  <- Row 4
```

What colors are these? 1, 4, 6, 1, 1.
Where do these colors appear prominently in M?

```
1 1 4 6 1
1 1 4 6 1
4 4 4 6 1
6 6 6 6 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Maybe it's the *most frequent* non-background (non-fill?) color in each row of M?
M Row 0: `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`. Most frequent is 1. BL row 0 is all 1s. Match.
M Row 1: `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`. Most frequent is 1. BL row 1 is all 4s. No match.

What if the fill color (1 in this case) is ignored when finding the most frequent?
M Row 0: `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`. Non-1 colors: `[4, 6]`. No single most frequent.
M Row 1: `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`. Non-1 colors: `[4, 6]`. No single most frequent.
M Row 2: `[4, 4, 4, 6, 1]`. Non-1 colors: `[4, 4, 4, 6]`. Most frequent is 4. BL row 2 is all 6s. No match.

Let's look at TR again:

```
1 4 6 1 1
1 4 6 1 1
1 4 6 1 1
1 4 6 1 1
1 4 6 1 1
```

Column 0 is all 1s.
Column 1 is all 4s.
Column 2 is all 6s.
Column 3 is all 1s.
Column 4 is all 1s.
The colors are `[1, 4, 6, 1, 1]`.
Where does this sequence appear in M?

```
1 1 4 6 1  <- Row 0
1 1 4 6 1  <- Row 1
4 4 4 6 1  <- Row 2
6 6 6 6 1  <- Row 3
1 1 1 1 1  <- Row 4
```

This sequence `[1, 4, 6, 1, 1]` doesn't appear directly.
What about the columns of M?
Col 0: `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`
Col 1: `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`
Col 2: `[4, 4, 4, 6, 1]`
Col 3: `[6, 6, 6, 6, 1]`
Col 4: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

Rule for TR: Fill column `c` of TR with the color `M[0, c]`.
Col 0: Fill with M[0,0] = 1. -> `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Matches TR col 0.
Col 1: Fill with M[0,1] = 1. -> `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Doesn't match TR col 1 (`[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`).

Rule for TR: Fill column `c` of TR with the color `M[c, c]` (diagonal).
Col 0: Fill with M[0,0] = 1. -> `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Matches TR col 0.
Col 1: Fill with M[1,1] = 1. -> `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Doesn't match TR col 1 (`[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`).

Rule for TR: Fill column `c` of TR with the color from the *first row* of M at column `c`. That is `M[0, c]`.
M Row 0: `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`
TR Col 0: all 1s. M[0,0]=1. Match.
TR Col 1: all 4s. M[0,1]=1. No match.

Rule for BL: Fill row `r` of BL with the color from the *first column* of M at row `r`. That is `M[r, 0]`.
M Col 0: `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`
BL Row 0: all 1s. M[0,0]=1. Match.
BL Row 1: all 4s. M[1,0]=1. No match.

Okay, back to basics.
Example 1:
Input -> TL=Modified, TR=?, BL=?, BR=?
Input: 5x5, top-left=1 (blue)
Modified: Input with 0->1
Expected Output: 10x10
TL: Modified (Correct)
TR: Columns [1, 4, 6, 1, 1] (filled vertically)
BL: Rows [1, 4, 6, 1, 1] (filled horizontally)
BR: ??

Let's look at the colors used for filling TR and BL: `[1, 4, 6, 1, 1]`.
Where does this sequence `1, 4, 6, 1, 1` come from?
Look at M:

```
1 1 4 6 1
1 1 4 6 1
4 4 4 6 1
6 6 6 6 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Diagonal of M is `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`. Not quite `[1, 4, 6, 1, 1]`.
First row of M is `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`. Not quite.
First column of M is `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`. Not quite.

Let's look at the Input I:

```
1 1 4 6 0
1 1 4 6 0
4 4 4 6 0
6 6 6 6 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

Diagonal of I is `[1, 1, 4, 6, 0]`.
First row of I is `[1, 1, 4, 6, 0]`.
First column of I is `[1, 1, 4, 6, 0]`.

Maybe the fill sequence comes from somewhere else?
Let's check Example 2.

``` python

Okay, Example 2 confirms:
*   TL quadrant is the Modified Grid M (Input with 0 replaced by top-left color).
*   TR quadrant consists of columns, where each column `c` is filled entirely with a single color. The sequence of colors across the columns is `[2, 2, 3, 2, 2]`.
*   BL quadrant consists of rows, where each row `r` is filled entirely with a single color. The sequence of colors down the rows is `[2, 2, 3, 2, 2]`.
*   The sequence `[2, 2, 3, 2, 2]` is used for both TR columns and BL rows.
*   This sequence `[2, 2, 3, 2, 2]` does NOT match the diagonal, first row, or first column of the Modified Grid M (`[2, 2, 2, 3, 2]`).

Let's re-examine the sequence for Example 1: `[1, 4, 6, 1, 1]`.
Compare to M1 diagonal `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`, row 0 `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`, col 0 `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`. No match.

Where could `[1, 4, 6, 1, 1]` (Ex1) and `[2, 2, 3, 2, 2]` (Ex2) come from?

Look at the structure of BR in both examples.
BR Ex1:

```
1 4 6 1 1
4 4 6 1 1
6 6 6 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

BR Ex2:

```
2 2 3 2 2
2 2 3 2 2
3 3 3 2 2
2 2 2 2 2
2 2 2 2 2
```

Hypothesis: BR is constructed using the same fill sequences?
Maybe BR[r, c] = color determined by r from BL sequence AND color determined by c from TR sequence? How to combine?

Let's test the hypothesis: `BL_sequence = [1, 4, 6, 1, 1]` and `TR_sequence = [1, 4, 6, 1, 1]` for Ex1.
BR[r, c] = BL_sequence[r]? No, BR rows are not uniform.
BR[r, c] = TR_sequence[c]? No, BR columns are not uniform.

What if BR[r, c] = M[r, c] but uses the sequences somehow?
What if BR[r, c] is related to the corner color M[0,0]?

Let's check Example 3. Input has no white (0) pixels.
Input Ex3:

```
2 3 4 1 6
3 3 4 1 6
4 4 4 1 6
1 1 1 1 6
6 6 6 6 6
```

Top-left = 2 (red).
Modified Grid M3 (replace 0 with 2) = Input Grid I3 (since no 0s).
Expected Output Ex3:

```
2 3 4 1 6 2 3 4 1 6
3 3 4 1 6 2 3 4 1 6
4 4 4 1 6 2 3 4 1 6
1 1 1 1 6 2 3 4 1 6
6 6 6 6 6 2 3 4 1 6
2 2 2 2 2 2 3 4 1 6
3 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 1 6
4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 1 6
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 6
6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
```

Let's extract quadrants and analyze using code.

``` python
import numpy as np

# Example 3 Input
input_ex3 = np.array([
    [2, 3, 4, 1, 6],
    [3, 3, 4, 1, 6],

Okay, Example 3 gives key insights!

1.  **Modified Grid (M):** When the input has no white (0), M is identical to the input (I).
2.  **Top-Left (TL):** Matches M (and I in this case).
3.  **Top-Right (TR):** Each column `c` is filled with a single color. The sequence of colors is `[2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`.
4.  **Bottom-Left (BL):** Each row `r` is filled with a single color. The sequence of colors is `[2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`.
5.  **Bottom-Right (BR):** Matches M (and I in this case).

Now, where do the sequences `[2, 3, 4, 1, 6]` (Ex3), `[1, 4, 6, 1, 1]` (Ex1), and `[2, 2, 3, 2, 2]` (Ex2) come from?

Let's compare the sequences to the first row and first column of the *modified* grid (M) in each example.

*   **Ex1:**
    *   M:
        
```
        1 1 4 6 1
        1 1 4 6 1
        4 4 4 6 1
        6 6 6 6 1
        1 1 1 1 1
        ```

    *   M Row 0: `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`
    *   M Col 0: `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`
    *   TR/BL Sequence: `[1, 4, 6, 1, 1]`
    *   Sequence != M Row 0. Sequence != M Col 0.

*   **Ex2:**
    *   M:
        
```
        2 2 2 3 2
        2 2 2 3 2
        2 2 2 3 2
        3 3 3 3 2
        2 2 2 2 2
        ```

    *   M Row 0: `[2, 2, 2, 3, 2]`
    *   M Col 0: `[2, 2, 2, 3, 2]`
    *   TR/BL Sequence: `[2, 2, 3, 2, 2]`
    *   Sequence != M Row 0. Sequence != M Col 0.

*   **Ex3:**
    *   M:
        
```
        2 3 4 1 6
        3 3 4 1 6
        4 4 4 1 6
        1 1 1 1 6
        6 6 6 6 6
        ```

    *   M Row 0: `[2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`
    *   M Col 0: `[2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`
    *   TR/BL Sequence: `[2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`
    *   Sequence == M Row 0. Sequence == M Col 0.

Hypothesis Refinement:
The sequence used for filling TR columns and BL rows is derived from the *modified* grid M.
*   For Ex3, the sequence *is* the first row (and first column) of M.
*   For Ex1 and Ex2, the sequence is *different* from the first row/column of M.

What is different about Ex3? The input had no white pixels.
What is different about the sequences in Ex1 and Ex2 compared to the first row/column of M?

Ex1:
M Row 0: `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`
Sequence: `[1, 4, 6, 1, 1]`
Difference: Index 1 changed from 1 to 4. Index 3 changed from 6 to 1.

Ex2:
M Row 0: `[2, 2, 2, 3, 2]`
Sequence: `[2, 2, 3, 2, 2]`
Difference: Index 2 changed from 2 to 3. Index 3 changed from 3 to 2.

This doesn't seem like a simple mapping.

Let's revisit the idea of "most frequent color".
Maybe the sequence is derived from the *columns* for TR and *rows* for BL?

**TR Rule Hypothesis:** The color filling column `c` of TR is the most frequent *non-background* color in column `c` of M. (Background = 0? Or the fill color used in M?). Let's assume background = 0 for now, although M doesn't have 0s. Let's use the fill color (top-left color) as the color to ignore.

*   **Ex1:** Fill color = 1 (blue).
    *   M Col 0: `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`. Non-1: `[4, 6]`. No single most frequent. -> Fails. Sequence[0] is 1.
    *   M Col 1: `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`. Non-1: `[4, 6]`. No single most frequent. -> Fails. Sequence[1] is 4.
    *   M Col 2: `[4, 4, 4, 6, 1]`. Non-1: `[4, 4, 4, 6]`. Most frequent is 4. -> Fails. Sequence[2] is 6.
    *   M Col 3: `[6, 6, 6, 6, 1]`. Non-1: `[6, 6, 6, 6]`. Most frequent is 6. -> Fails. Sequence[3] is 1.
    *   M Col 4: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Non-1: `[]`. Default to fill color? -> Maybe 1. Sequence[4] is 1.

This "most frequent non-fill" rule doesn't work.

What if the sequence is derived from the *input* grid I?

*   **Ex1:** Input I, Top-left = 1 (blue)
    
```
    1 1 4 6 0
    1 1 4 6 0
    4 4 4 6 0
    6 6 6 6 0
    0 0 0 0 0
    ```

    Sequence: `[1, 4, 6, 1, 1]`
    *   I Row 0: `[1, 1, 4, 6, 0]`
    *   I Col 0: `[1, 1, 4, 6, 0]`
*   **Ex2:** Input I, Top-left = 2 (red)
    
```
    2 2 2 3 0
    2 2 2 3 0
    2 2 2 3 0
    3 3 3 3 0
    0 0 0 0 0
    ```

    Sequence: `[2, 2, 3, 2, 2]`
    *   I Row 0: `[2, 2, 2, 3, 0]`
    *   I Col 0: `[2, 2, 2, 3, 0]`
*   **Ex3:** Input I, Top-left = 2 (red)
    
```
    2 3 4 1 6
    3 3 4 1 6
    4 4 4 1 6
    1 1 1 1 6
    6 6 6 6 6
    ```

    Sequence: `[2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`
    *   I Row 0: `[2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`
    *   I Col 0: `[2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`

**New Hypothesis:**
1.  Create the Modified Grid M by replacing white (0) in Input I with the top-left color `C = I[0, 0]`.
2.  Define a sequence `S`.
    *   If Input I contains white (0): The source of `S` is unclear.
    *   If Input I does *not* contain white (0): `S` is the first row of I (or M, since I=M). `S = M[0, :]`.
3.  The output grid O (size 2H x 2W) is constructed:
    *   TL quadrant `O[0:H, 0:W]` = M
    *   TR quadrant `O[0:H, W:2*W]`: Column `c` is filled with color `S[c]`.
    *   BL quadrant `O[H:2*H, 0:W]`: Row `r` is filled with color `S[r]`? **Wait**, let's recheck Ex3 BL sequence.
        *   Ex3 M Col 0 is `[2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`.
        *   Ex3 BL Row colors are `[2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`.
        *   So, the BL row color sequence matches the *first column* of M (or I).
    *   BR quadrant `O[H:2*H, W:2*W]`: M? (Matches for Ex3, let's check Ex1, Ex2)
        *   Ex1 BR: Different from M1.
        *   Ex2 BR: Different from M2.

Okay, let's refine the hypothesis structure and sequence source.

**Revised Hypothesis:**
1.  Identify Input I (H x W). Get top-left color `C = I[0, 0]`.
2.  Create Modified Grid M (H x W) by replacing white (0) in I with `C`.
3.  Define Row Sequence `SR = M[:, 0]` (First column of M).
4.  Define Col Sequence `SC = M[0, :]` (First row of M).
5.  Construct Output O (2H x 2W):
    *   TL `O[0:H, 0:W]` = M
    *   TR `O[0:H, W:2*W]`: Column `c` is filled with color `SC[c]`.
    *   BL `O[H:2*H, 0:W]`: Row `r` is filled with color `SR[r]`.
    *   BR `O[H:2*H, W:2*W]` = M

Let's test this revised hypothesis.

*   **Ex3:** (I has no 0s, M=I)
    *   M = I = `[[2,3,4,1,6], [3,3,4,1,6], [4,4,4,1,6], [1,1,1,1,6], [6,6,6,6,6]]`
    *   SR = M[:, 0] = `[2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`
    *   SC = M[0, :] = `[2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`
    *   TL = M. Matches expected.
    *   TR: Col 0=2, Col 1=3, Col 2=4, Col 3=1, Col 4=6. Matches expected `[[2,3,4,1,6]]*5` (transposed).
    *   BL: Row 0=2, Row 1=3, Row 2=4, Row 3=1, Row 4=6. Matches expected `[[2]*5, [3]*5, [4]*5, [1]*5, [6]*5]`.
    *   BR = M. Matches expected.
    *   This hypothesis works perfectly for Example 3.

*   **Ex1:** (I has 0s, C=1)
    *   M = `[[1,1,4,6,1], [1,1,4,6,1], [4,4,4,6,1], [6,6,6,6,1], [1,1,1,1,1]]`
    *   SR = M[:, 0] = `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`
    *   SC = M[0, :] = `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`
    *   TL = M. Matches expected `exp_tl_ex1`.
    *   TR: Use SC `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`. Columns should be filled with 1, 1, 4, 6, 1.
        *   Expected TR is `[[1,4,6,1,1]]*5` (transposed). Columns filled with 1, 4, 6, 1, 1.
        *   Hypothesis fails for TR.
    *   BL: Use SR `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`. Rows should be filled with 1, 1, 4, 6, 1.
        *   Expected BL is `[[1]*5, [4]*5, [6]*5, [1]*5, [1]*5]`. Rows filled with 1, 4, 6, 1, 1.
        *   Hypothesis fails for BL.
    *   BR = M. Expected BR is `[[1,4,6,1,1], [4,4,6,1,1], [6,6,6,1,1], [1,1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1,1]]`.
        *   Hypothesis fails for BR.

The hypothesis derived from Ex3 doesn't generalize. The sequences `SR` and `SC` used for Ex1 and Ex2 must be different.

Let's look at the *expected* sequences for Ex1 and Ex2 again.
*   Ex1 Sequence (used for TR cols and BL rows): `S1 = [1, 4, 6, 1, 1]`
*   Ex2 Sequence (used for TR cols and BL rows): `S2 = [2, 2, 3, 2, 2]`

How are S1 and S2 derived?

Consider the Modified grid M again.
*   Ex1 M:
    
```
    1 1 4 6 1
    1 1 4 6 1
    4 4 4 6 1
    6 6 6 6 1
    1 1 1 1 1
    ```

    S1 = `[1, 4, 6, 1, 1]`
*   Ex2 M:
    
```
    2 2 2 3 2
    2 2 2 3 2
    2 2 2 3 2
    3 3 3 3 2
    2 2 2 2 2
    ```

    S2 = `[2, 2, 3, 2, 2]`

Could S be derived from the diagonal of M?
*   Ex1 M diag: `[1, 1, 4, 6, 1]`. S1: `[1, 4, 6, 1, 1]`. No.
*   Ex2 M diag: `[2, 2, 2, 3, 2]`. S2: `[2, 2, 3, 2, 2]`. No.

Could S be derived from the structure of M?
Let's look at blocks/objects in M.
*   Ex1 M: Has shapes of 1s, 4s, 6s.
*   Ex2 M: Has shapes of 2s, 3s.

Maybe S represents some property of the rows/columns.

Let's rethink the quadrants again.
TL = M (Input with 0->C) - Seems consistent.
TR = Columns filled based on sequence S.
BL = Rows filled based on sequence S.
BR = ?

Consider BR again.
Ex1 BR:

```
1 4 6 1 1
4 4 6 1 1
6 6 6 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Ex2 BR:

```
2 2 3 2 2
2 2 3 2 2
3 3 3 2 2
2 2 2 2 2
2 2 2 2 2
```

Ex3 BR: (Equals M3)

```
2 3 4 1 6
3 3 4 1 6
4 4 4 1 6
1 1 1 1 6
6 6 6 6 6
```

BR looks related to M, but modified. How?
Compare M1 and BR1:
M1:

```
1 1 4 6 1
1 1 4 6 1
4 4 4 6 1
6 6 6 6 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

BR1:

```
1 4 6 1 1
4 4 6 1 1
6 6 6 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

It looks like BR1[r, c] = S1[max(r, c)]? No.
BR1[r, c] = S1[r]? No.
BR1[r, c] = S1[c]? No.

Let's reconsider the sequence generation.
Maybe S is not one sequence, but SR for rows and SC for columns, and they might be different?
In Ex1 & Ex2, the sequences seemed the same based on the first row/column of TR/BL. Let's verify.
Ex1 Expected TR: Columns `[1, 4, 6, 1, 1]`
Ex1 Expected BL: Rows `[1, 4, 6, 1, 1]` -> Yes, sequence S1 is used for both.
Ex2 Expected TR: Columns `[2, 2, 3, 2, 2]`
Ex2 Expected BL: Rows `[2, 2, 3, 2, 2]` -> Yes, sequence S2 is used for both.
Ex3 Expected TR: Columns `[2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`
Ex3 Expected BL: Rows `[2, 3, 4, 1, 6]` -> Yes, sequence S3 is used for both.

So, there is a single sequence `S` derived from the input/modified grid, which is used for TR and BL.
How is S derived?
S1 = `[1, 4, 6, 1, 1]` from M1
S2 = `[2, 2, 3, 2, 2]` from M2
S3 = `[2, 3, 4, 1, 6]` from M3 (where S3 = M3[0,:] = M3[:,0])

Is S = `[ M[i, i] if some_condition else M[0, i] for i in range(W) ]`? No.
Is S = `[ M[i, i] if some_condition else M[i, 0] for i in range(H) ]`? No.

Let's look at the input shapes.
I1: L-shape of 1s, T-shape of 4s, L-shape of 6s, background 0.
M1: Background 0s filled with 1.
S1 = `[1, 4, 6, 1, 1]`

I2: Block of 2s, L-shape of 3s, background 0.
M2: Background 0s filled with 2.
S2 = `[2, 2, 3, 2, 2]`

I3: Various blocks, no background 0.
M3 = I3.
S3 = `[2, 3, 4, 1, 6]` (First row/col of M3)

Consider the path from (0,0) along the grid border? No.
Consider the diagonal?

What if S[i] depends on the colors present in row `i` AND column `i` of M?

Let's focus on S1 = `[1, 4, 6, 1, 1]` from M1:

```
  (c=0 1 2 3 4)
(r=0) 1 1 4 6 1
(r=1) 1 1 4 6 1
(r=2) 4 4 4 6 1
(r=3) 6 6 6 6 1
(r=4) 1 1 1 1 1
```

S1[0] = 1. M[0,0]=1.
S1[1] = 4. Row 1 = `[1,1,4,6,1]`. Col 1 = `[1,1,4,6,1]`. Where does 4 come from? M[2,1]=4. M[2,0]=4.
S1[2] = 6. Row 2 = `[4,4,4,6,1]`. Col 2 = `[4,4,4,6,1]`. Where does 6 come from? M[3,2]=6. M[0,3]=6. M[1,3]=6. M[2,3]=6. M[3,0]=6. M[3,1]=6. M[3,3]=6.
S1[3] = 1. Row 3 = `[6,6,6,6,1]`. Col 3 = `[6,6,6,6,1]`. Where does 1 come from? M[0,4]=1. M[1,4]=1. M[2,4]=1. M[3,4]=1. M[4,0]=1. M[4,1]=1. M[4,2]=1. M[4,3]=1. M[4,4]=1.
S1[4] = 1. Row 4 = `[1,1,1,1,1]`. Col 4 = `[1,1,1,1,1]`. M[4,4]=1.

Let's try: S[i] = M[k, i] where k is the largest index such that M[k, i] != C (fill color)?
Ex1: C=1. S1 = `[1, 4, 6, 1, 1]`
i=0: M[:,0]=[1,1,4,6,1]. Largest k where M[k,0]!=1 is k=3 (M[3,0]=6). -> Fails (S[0]=1).
i=1: M[:,1]=[1,1,4,6,1]. Largest k where M[k,1]!=1 is k=3 (M[3,1]=6). -> Fails (S[1]=4).

Let's try: S[i] = M[i, k] where k is the largest index such that M[i, k] != C?
Ex1: C=1. S1 = `[1, 4, 6, 1, 1]`
i=0: M[0,:]=[1,1,4,6,1]. Largest k where M[0,k]!=1 is k=3 (M[0,3]=6). -> Fails (S[0]=1).
i=1: M[1,:]=[1,1,4,6,1]. Largest k where M[1,k]!=1 is k=3 (M[1,k]=6). -> Fails (S[1]=4).

Maybe S involves finding the unique non-fill colors?
Ex1: C=1. Non-fill colors in M1 are 4, 6.
S1 = `[1, 4, 6, 1, 1]`

Ex2: C=2. Non-fill colors in M2 is 3.
S2 = `[2, 2, 3, 2, 2]`

Ex3: C=2. Non-fill colors in M3 are 3, 4, 1, 6.
S3 = `[2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`

This doesn't seem helpful.

What about the BR quadrant construction?
BR seems to be related to M.
Compare M and BR side-by-side.

Ex1: C=1, S1=`[1,4,6,1,1]`
M1:             BR1:
1 1 4 6 1       1 4 6 1 1
1 1 4 6 1       4 4 6 1 1
4 4 4 6 1       6 6 6 1 1
6 6 6 6 1       1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1       1 1 1 1 1

Ex2: C=2, S2=`[2,2,3,2,2]`
M2:             BR2:
2 2 2 3 2       2 2 3 2 2
2 2 2 3 2       2 2 3 2 2
2 2 2 3 2       3 3 3 2 2
3 3 3 3 2       2 2 2 2 2
2 2 2 2 2       2 2 2 2 2

Ex3: C=2, S3=`[2,3,4,1,6]`
M3:             BR3: (same as M3)
2 3 4 1 6       2 3 4 1 6
3 3 4 1 6       3 3 4 1 6
4 4 4 1 6       4 4 4 1 6
1 1 1 1 6       1 1 1 1 6
6 6 6 6 6       6 6 6 6 6

Is BR[r, c] = S[r] if r >= c else S[c]? No.
Is BR[r, c] = M[r, c] unless some condition applies?

Look at Ex1 M1 vs BR1 differences:
M1[0,1]=1 -> BR1[0,1]=4 = S1[1]
M1[0,2]=4 -> BR1[0,2]=6 = S1[2]
M1[0,3]=6 -> BR1[0,3]=1 = S1[3]? No, S1[3]=1. Hmm. Let me recheck S1.
TR1 cols: 1, 4, 6, 1, 1. S1=[1,4,6,1,1]. Yes.
M1[0,3]=6, BR1[0,3]=1. Correct.

M1[1,0]=1 -> BR1[1,0]=4 = S1[1]? Yes.
M1[1,1]=1 -> BR1[1,1]=4 = S1[1]? Yes.
M1[1,2]=4 -> BR1[1,2]=6 = S1[2]? Yes.
M1[1,3]=6 -> BR1[1,3]=1 = S1[3]? Yes.

M1[2,0]=4 -> BR1[2,0]=6 = S1[2]? Yes.
M1[2,1]=4 -> BR1[2,1]=6 = S1[2]? Yes.
M1[2,2]=4 -> BR1[2,2]=6 = S1[2]? Yes.
M1[2,3]=6 -> BR1[2,3]=1 = S1[3]? Yes.

M1[3,0]=6 -> BR1[3,0]=1 = S1[3]? Yes.
M1[3,1]=6 -> BR1[3,1]=1 = S1[3]? Yes.
M1[3,2]=6 -> BR1[3,2]=1 = S1[3]? Yes.
M1[3,3]=6 -> BR1[3,3]=1 = S1[3]? Yes.

M1[4,:] = [1,1,1,1,1]. C=1. BR1[4,:] = [1,1,1,1,1]. No change.
M1[:,4] = [1,1,1,1,1]. C=1. BR1[:,4] = [1,1,1,1,1]. No change.

Hypothesis for BR:
BR[r, c] = M[r, c] if M[r, c] == C (fill color)
BR[r, c] = S[max(r, c)] otherwise?

Let's test BR[r, c] = S[max(r, c)] if M[r, c] != C:
Ex1: C=1, S1=`[1,4,6,1,1]`
BR[0,0]: M[0,0]=1==C. Keep 1. Match BR1[0,0].
BR[0,1]: M[0,1]=1==C. Keep 1. -> Fails (BR1[0,1]=4).
BR[0,2]: M[0,2]=4!=C. Use S1[max(0,2)] = S1[2] = 6. Match BR1[0,2].
BR[0,3]: M[0,3]=6!=C. Use S1[max(0,3)] = S1[3] = 1. Match BR1[0,3].
BR[0,4]: M[0,4]=1==C. Keep 1. Match BR1[0,4].
BR[1,0]: M[1,0]=1==C. Keep 1. -> Fails (BR1[1,0]=4).
BR[1,1]: M[1,1]=1==C. Keep 1. -> Fails (BR1[1,1]=4).
BR[1,2]: M[1,2]=4!=C. Use S1[max(1,2)] = S1[2] = 6. Match BR1[1,2].
BR[1,3]: M[1,3]=6!=C. Use S1[max(1,3)] = S1[3] = 1. Match BR1[1,3].
BR[1,4]: M[1,4]=1==C. Keep 1. Match BR1[1,4].
BR[2,0]: M[2,0]=4!=C. Use S1[max(2,0)] = S1[2] = 6. Match BR1[2,0].
BR[2,1]: M[2,1]=4!=C. Use S1[max(2,1)] = S1[2] = 6. Match BR1[2,1].
BR[2,2]: M[2,2]=4!=C. Use S1[max(2,2)] = S1[2] = 6. Match BR1[2,2].
BR[2,3]: M[2,3]=6!=C. Use S1[max(2,3)] = S1[3] = 1. Match BR1[2,3].
BR[2,4]: M[2,4]=1==C. Keep 1. Match BR1[2,4].
... This looks promising, except when M[r,c]==C.

What if BR[r, c] = S[max(r, c)] always?
BR[0,0] = S1[0] = 1. Match.
BR[0,1] = S1[1] = 4. Match.
BR[0,2] = S1[2] = 6. Match.
BR[0,3] = S1[3] = 1. Match.
BR[0,4] = S1[4] = 1. Match.
BR[1,0] = S1[1] = 4. Match.
BR[1,1] = S1[1] = 4. Match.
BR[1,2] = S1[2] = 6. Match.
BR[1,3] = S1[3] = 1. Match.
BR[1,4] = S1[4] = 1. Match.
BR[2,0] = S1[2] = 6. Match.
BR[2,1] = S1[2] = 6. Match.
BR[2,2] = S1[2] = 6. Match.
BR[2,3] = S1[3] = 1. Match.
BR[2,4] = S1[4] = 1. Match.
BR[3,0] = S1[3] = 1. Match.
BR[3,1] = S1[3] = 1. Match.
BR[3,2] = S1[3] = 1. Match.
BR[3,3] = S1[3] = 1. Match.
BR[3,4] = S1[4] = 1. Match.
BR[4,0] = S1[4] = 1. Match.
BR[4,1] = S1[4] = 1. Match.
BR[4,2] = S1[4] = 1. Match.
BR[4,3] = S1[4] = 1. Match.
BR[4,4] = S1[4] = 1. Match.
This rule `BR[r, c] = S[max(r, c)]` perfectly reproduces BR1!

Let's test on Ex2: C=2, S2=`[2,2,3,2,2]`
BR2 should be:
BR[0,0]=S2[0]=2. BR[0,1]=S2[1]=2. BR[0,2]=S2[2]=3. BR[0,3]=S2[3]=2. BR[0,4]=S2[4]=2. ->
