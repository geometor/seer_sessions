task_type: Grid Transformation

input_grid:
  properties:
    - dimensions: H rows, W columns (variable, e.g., 5x5)
    - content: Pixels with colors 0-9
  key_elements:
    - top_left_pixel: The pixel at coordinates (0, 0)
    - white_pixels: Pixels with color value 0

output_grid:
  properties:
    - dimensions: 2H rows, 2W columns
    - structure: Composed of four quadrants, each HxW
  quadrants:
    - top_left: Copy of the original input_grid
    - top_right: Copy of the modified_grid
    - bottom_left: Copy of the modified_grid
    - bottom_right: Copy of the modified_grid

derived_elements:
  - fill_color: The color of the top_left_pixel of the input_grid
  - modified_grid:
      derivation: A copy of the input_grid where every white_pixel (color 0) is replaced by the fill_color.

actions:
  - Determine: Get the dimensions (H, W) of the input_grid.
  - Identify: Get the fill_color from input_grid[0, 0].
  - Create: Generate the modified_grid by replacing white pixels in the input_grid with the fill_color.
  - Assemble: Construct the output_grid (2H x 2W) by placing the input_grid in the top-left quadrant and the modified_grid in the other three quadrants.

relationships:
  - Output dimensions are double the input dimensions.
  - The content of the output's top-left quadrant is identical to the input grid.
  - The content of the output's other three quadrants depends on the input grid and the fill_color.
  - The modification rule specifically targets white pixels (color 0).
