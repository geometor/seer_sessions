            "text": "**Perception**\n\nThe task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid that is twice the height and twice the width of the input. The output grid appears to be composed of four quadrants, each the size of the original input grid.\n\nObserving the examples:\n1.  The output grid dimensions are consistently double the input grid dimensions (e.g., 5x5 input -> 10x10 output).\n2.  The output grid is formed by placing four grids together in a 2x2 arrangement.\n3.  The top-left quadrant of the output grid is always an exact copy of the original input grid.\n4.  The other three quadrants (top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) appear to be derived from the input grid, but with a specific modification.\n5.  By comparing the top-left (original input) quadrant with the other quadrants in each example, the modification seems to involve replacing the white pixels (color 0).\n6.  The color used to replace the white pixels is consistently the color found at the top-left corner (index 0, 0) of the original input grid.\n    *   In `train_1`, input[0,0] is blue (1). The white pixels (0) in the input are replaced by blue (1) in the other three quadrants of the output.\n    *   In `train_2`, input[0,0] is red (2). The white pixels (0) in the input are replaced by red (2) in the other three quadrants of the output.\n    *   In `train_3`, input[0,0] is red (2). There are no white pixels (0) in the input. Consequently, the \"modified\" grid is identical to the original input grid, and all four quadrants of the output are copies of the input grid.\n\nTherefore, the transformation rule involves creating a modified version of the input grid where white pixels are replaced by the color of the top-left pixel, and then tiling the original input and the modified grid into a larger 2x2 output grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
