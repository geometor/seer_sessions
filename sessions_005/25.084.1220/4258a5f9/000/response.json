            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids consist primarily of a white (0) background with a few scattered gray (5) pixels. These gray pixels appear isolated from each other.\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grids retain the original gray (5) pixels in their exact positions. Additionally, blue (1) pixels appear in the output.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve the gray pixels. For each gray pixel in the input, its immediate 8 neighbors (including diagonals) are changed to blue (1) in the output grid.\n4.  **Structure:** The gray pixels in the input act as \"centers\" or \"seeds\". The blue pixels in the output form a hollow square (or frame) of size 3x3 around each original gray pixel. The center of this 3x3 area retains the gray color.\n5.  **Background:** Pixels that were originally white (0) and are not adjacent to any gray pixel remain white (0) in the output.\n6.  **Boundaries:** If a gray pixel is near the edge or corner of the grid, the surrounding blue \"frame\" is clipped by the grid boundaries. Only neighbors within the grid are colored blue.\n7.  **Consistency:** Both examples (`train_1` and `train_2`) follow the same rule: find gray pixels, keep them, and color their valid neighbors blue.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
