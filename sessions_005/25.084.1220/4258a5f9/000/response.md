Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids consist primarily of a white (0) background with a few scattered gray (5) pixels. These gray pixels appear isolated from each other.
2.  **Output Grid:** The output grids retain the original gray (5) pixels in their exact positions. Additionally, blue (1) pixels appear in the output.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve the gray pixels. For each gray pixel in the input, its immediate 8 neighbors (including diagonals) are changed to blue (1) in the output grid.
4.  **Structure:** The gray pixels in the input act as "centers" or "seeds". The blue pixels in the output form a hollow square (or frame) of size 3x3 around each original gray pixel. The center of this 3x3 area retains the gray color.
5.  **Background:** Pixels that were originally white (0) and are not adjacent to any gray pixel remain white (0) in the output.
6.  **Boundaries:** If a gray pixel is near the edge or corner of the grid, the surrounding blue "frame" is clipped by the grid boundaries. Only neighbors within the grid are colored blue.
7.  **Consistency:** Both examples (`train_1` and `train_2`) follow the same rule: find gray pixels, keep them, and color their valid neighbors blue.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially identical to the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid to find the locations (row, column) of all gray (5) pixels.
3.  For each found gray pixel at location (r, c):
    a.  Consider its 8 neighboring positions: (r-1, c-1), (r-1, c), (r-1, c+1), (r, c-1), (r, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r+1, c), (r+1, c+1).
    b.  For each neighboring position (nr, nc):
        i.  Check if the position (nr, nc) is within the valid bounds of the grid.
        ii. If the position is within bounds, change the color of the pixel at (nr, nc) in the *output* grid to blue (1).
4.  The final output grid contains the original gray pixels and the newly added blue neighboring pixels, with the rest remaining as they were in the input (mostly white).
