task_context:
  grid_size:
    input_dims: [9, 9]
    output_dims: [9, 9]
    invariant: true
  colors_involved:
    - white (0) # Background
    - gray (5)  # Input markers, preserved in output
    - blue (1)  # Output markers
objects:
  - type: pixel
    color: gray (5)
    role: marker
    location: specific coordinates in the input grid
    persistence: preserved in the output grid at the same location
  - type: pixel
    color: blue (1)
    role: indicator
    location: adjacent (including diagonal) to gray pixels in the output grid
    persistence: generated in the output grid
  - type: pixel
    color: white (0)
    role: background
    location: occupies most of the grid initially
    persistence: preserved unless adjacent to a gray marker
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    from: gray (5) pixel in input
    to: blue (1) pixels in output
    details: Each blue pixel in the output is one of the 8 neighbors of a gray pixel.
actions:
  - action: find_pixels
    color: gray (5)
    source: input_grid
  - action: copy_pixels
    color: gray (5)
    source: input_grid
    destination: output_grid
    location: same coordinates
  - action: create_pixels
    color: blue (1)
    destination: output_grid
    location: at the 8 neighboring coordinates (if valid) of each gray pixel found in the input.
