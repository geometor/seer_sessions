            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The input is a grid containing various colored pixels (0-9), with 0 representing the white background. The output is also a grid, typically smaller than the input, containing a subset or transformation of the input's colored pixels.\n2.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels in the input grid form distinct contiguous regions or \"objects\". These objects can be composed of a single color or multiple colors. Connectivity seems to be based on adjacent cells (up, down, left, right - 4-way).\n3.  **Transformation Goal:** The task seems to involve selecting one specific object (or information derived from it) from the input grid based on certain criteria and presenting it as the output.\n4.  **Selection Criteria:** The selection appears linked to the minimum color index present in the input (excluding the white background color 0).\n5.  **Output Generation:** The way the output grid is generated depends on whether one or multiple objects contain this minimum color, and whether the selected object is mono-colored or multi-colored.\n    *   If a single object contains the minimum color:\n        *   If it's multi-colored, the output is the object itself, cropped to its bounding box. (Example 3)\n        *   If it's mono-colored, the output is a vertical column containing all the pixels of that object. (Example 2)\n    *   If multiple objects contain the minimum color: The task seems to switch criteria and look for a unique object that is a \"solid square\" (a square region filled entirely with a single color). The output is this solid square object. (Example 1)\n\n## Facts\n\n"
