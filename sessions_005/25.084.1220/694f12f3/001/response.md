"""
Identifies two solid yellow rectangular objects in the input grid. Calculates the area of each rectangle. Fills the interior of the larger rectangle with red (2) and the interior of the smaller rectangle with blue (1), leaving a 1-pixel yellow border around each. The background remains unchanged. The interior consists of all yellow pixels not part of the outer border.
