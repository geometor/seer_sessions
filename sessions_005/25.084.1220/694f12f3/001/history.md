## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of the same dimensions (10x10 in both examples).
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0 - background), yellow (4 - objects), red (2 - fill color), and blue (1 - fill color).
3.  **Objects:** The input grids contain two distinct, solid yellow (4) rectangular objects on a white (0) background.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation modifies the *interior* pixels of the yellow rectangles, leaving the border pixels yellow and the background white.
5.  **Color Change Logic:** The color used to fill the interior of a rectangle depends on a comparison between the two rectangles present in the input.
    *   In `train_1`, the larger rectangle (5x5=25 pixels) gets its interior filled with red (2), while the smaller one (3x4=12 pixels) gets its interior filled with blue (1).
    *   In `train_2`, the larger rectangle (4x6=24 pixels) gets its interior filled with red (2), while the smaller one (4x4=16 pixels) gets its interior filled with blue (1).
6.  **Interior Definition:** The "interior" seems to be all yellow pixels that are not part of the 1-pixel thick border of the rectangle.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_modification
input_features:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D grid containing pixels of different colors.
  - type: objects
    description: Contains two distinct solid rectangular objects composed of yellow (4) pixels, set against a white (0) background.
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - shape: rectangle (solid)
      - count: 2 per input grid
      - size: variable (area differs between rectangles within and across examples)
      - position: variable
transformation:
  - type: identify_objects
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_yellow_rectangles
    criteria: Find connected components of yellow (4) pixels forming solid rectangles.
  - type: calculate_properties
    input: list_of_yellow_rectangles
    output: list_of_rectangles_with_area
    action: Calculate the area (height * width) for each identified rectangle.
  - type: compare_properties
    input: list_of_rectangles_with_area
    output: mapping_rectangle_to_fill_color
    condition: If there are two rectangles, compare their areas.
    logic:
      - The rectangle with the larger area is mapped to red (2).
      - The rectangle with the smaller area is mapped to blue (1).
  - type: modify_objects
    input:
      - input_grid
      - mapping_rectangle_to_fill_color
    output: output_grid
    action: For each yellow rectangle in the input grid:
      - Identify its "interior" pixels (all yellow pixels not on the 1-pixel border).
      - Change the color of these interior pixels to the fill color determined by the area comparison (red=2 for larger, blue=1 for smaller).
      - Leave the border yellow (4) pixels and the background white (0) pixels unchanged.
output_features:
  - type: grid
    description: Same dimensions as the input grid.
  - type: objects
    description: The original yellow rectangles now have their interiors filled with either red (2) or blue (1), based on relative size. The borders remain yellow (4). The background remains white (0).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all separate, solid rectangular objects composed of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
3.  Calculate the area (number of pixels) of each identified yellow rectangle.
4.  Compare the areas of the two yellow rectangles found.
5.  Determine the fill color for each rectangle:
    *   Assign red (2) as the fill color for the rectangle with the larger area.
    *   Assign blue (1) as the fill color for the rectangle with the smaller area.
6.  For each yellow rectangle:
    *   Identify all its pixels that are *not* on its outer border (the "interior" pixels). These are the yellow pixels that are surrounded only by other yellow pixels belonging to the same rectangle (considering 8-way adjacency).
    *   Change the color of these identified interior pixels in the output grid to the fill color (red or blue) determined in step 5.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
