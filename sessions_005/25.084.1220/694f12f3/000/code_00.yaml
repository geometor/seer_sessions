input_features:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D grid containing pixels of different colors.
  - type: objects
    description: Contains two distinct solid rectangular objects composed of yellow (4) pixels, set against a white (0) background.
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - shape: rectangle (solid)
      - count: 2 per input grid
      - size: variable (area differs between rectangles within and across examples)
      - position: variable
transformation:
  - type: identify_objects
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_yellow_rectangles
    criteria: Find connected components of yellow (4) pixels forming solid rectangles.
  - type: calculate_properties
    input: list_of_yellow_rectangles
    output: list_of_rectangles_with_area
    action: Calculate the area (height * width) for each identified rectangle.
  - type: compare_properties
    input: list_of_rectangles_with_area
    output: mapping_rectangle_to_fill_color
    condition: If there are two rectangles, compare their areas.
    logic:
      - The rectangle with the larger area is mapped to red (2).
      - The rectangle with the smaller area is mapped to blue (1).
  - type: modify_objects
    input:
      - input_grid
      - mapping_rectangle_to_fill_color
    output: output_grid
    action: For each yellow rectangle in the input grid:
      - Identify its "interior" pixels (all yellow pixels not on the 1-pixel border).
      - Change the color of these interior pixels to the fill color determined by the area comparison (red=2 for larger, blue=1 for smaller).
      - Leave the border yellow (4) pixels and the background white (0) pixels unchanged.
output_features:
  - type: grid
    description: Same dimensions as the input grid.
  - type: objects
    description: The original yellow rectangles now have their interiors filled with either red (2) or blue (1), based on relative size. The borders remain yellow (4). The background remains white (0).
