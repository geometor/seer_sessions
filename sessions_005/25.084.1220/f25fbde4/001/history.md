Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels, predominantly white (0), with a single distinct object composed of yellow (4) pixels.
2.  **Object Identification:** The key element in the input is the yellow object. Its shape and position vary between examples.
3.  **Transformation Goal:** The output grid appears to be a magnified or scaled version of the yellow object found in the input.
4.  **Size Change:** The output grid dimensions are consistently different from the input grid dimensions. Specifically, the output grid dimensions seem related to the dimensions of the yellow object in the input, not the overall input grid size.
5.  **Scaling Factor:** Comparing the input yellow object's extent to the output yellow object's extent suggests a scaling factor of 2 in both height and width. Each pixel (both yellow and the white pixels within the object's bounds) from a specific region of the input seems to be expanded into a 2x2 block of the same color in the output.
6.  **Cropping:** The transformation doesn't scale the entire input grid. It focuses only on the region containing the yellow object. This implies identifying the minimal bounding box around the yellow object in the input, extracting that subgrid, and then scaling *that* subgrid.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Scale a cropped region of the input grid.

Input_Grid:
  - Properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 9x9)
      - pixels: primarily white (0)
  - Objects:
      - Background:
          - color: white (0)
          - extent: majority of the grid
      - Shape:
          - color: yellow (4)
          - pixels: contiguous or near-contiguous block
          - count: 1 per grid
          - Properties:
              - bounding_box: the smallest rectangle enclosing all yellow pixels.

Output_Grid:
  - Properties:
      - dimensions: variable, determined by the input shape's bounding box scaled by 2. (height = bbox_height * 2, width = bbox_width * 2)
      - pixels: white (0) and yellow (4)
  - Objects:
      - Scaled_Shape:
          - derivation: Each pixel (r, c) within the input shape's bounding_box corresponds to a 2x2 block in the output grid starting at (2*r, 2*c).
          - color: Preserves the color of the corresponding input pixel within the bounding box.

Relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions are twice the dimensions of the bounding box of the yellow shape in the input grid.
  - The content of the output grid is determined by scaling the content (both yellow and white pixels) within the input shape's bounding box by a factor of 2x2.

Actions:
  1. Identify all yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
  2. Calculate the minimum bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) that encloses all yellow pixels.
  3. Extract the subgrid corresponding to this bounding box from the input grid.
  4. Create a new output grid with height = (max_row - min_row + 1) * 2 and width = (max_col - min_col + 1) * 2.
  5. Iterate through each pixel (r, c) with color C in the extracted subgrid.
  6. Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid starting at position (r * 2, c * 2) with the color C.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Find all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color 0). These constitute the "object".
2.  Determine the smallest rectangular region (the bounding box) that contains all pixels identified in step 1. Note the top-left (min_row, min_col) and bottom-right (max_row, max_col) coordinates of this box.
3.  Create a new, empty grid (the output grid) whose height is `(max_row - min_row + 1) * 2` and whose width is `(max_col - min_col + 1) * 2`.
4.  Iterate through each cell within the bounding box of the input grid, from `(min_row, min_col)` to `(max_row, max_col)`. Let the coordinates relative to the bounding box's top-left corner be `(rel_r, rel_c)`, where `rel_r = current_row - min_row` and `rel_c = current_col - min_col`. Let the color of the input cell at `(current_row, current_col)` be `C`.
5.  For each input cell processed in step 4, color a 2x2 block of cells in the output grid with color `C`. The top-left corner of this 2x2 block in the output grid should be at coordinates `(rel_r * 2, rel_c * 2)`. That is, set the color `C` for the output cells at `(rel_r * 2, rel_c * 2)`, `(rel_r * 2 + 1, rel_c * 2)`, `(rel_r * 2, rel_c * 2 + 1)`, and `(rel_r * 2 + 1, rel_c * 2 + 1)`.
6.  The resulting grid is the final output.
