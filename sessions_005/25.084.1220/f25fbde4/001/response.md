"""
Scales the region defined by the bounding box of non-white pixels in the input grid by a factor of 2x2.

1. Find all non-white pixels in the input grid.
2. Determine the minimum bounding box containing these pixels.
3. Extract the subgrid defined by this bounding box.
4. Create an output grid with dimensions twice those of the extracted subgrid.
5. Iterate through each pixel of the extracted subgrid.
6. For each pixel, color a corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid with the same color.
