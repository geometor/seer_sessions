The background pixels (white, 0) remain unchanged.\n4.  **Positional Dependence:** The decision to change a pixel's color seems to depend on its position (row and column index) within the grid.\n5.  **Pattern:** Comparing the coordinates of pixels that change color versus those that don't reveals a consistent pattern across all examples: Non-white pixels located in columns with an *odd* index change their color to yellow (4). Non-white pixels in columns with an *even* index retain their original color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
