task_description: Modify the color of certain non-background pixels based on their column position.
grid_properties:
  - dimension_preservation: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - background_color: White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
objects:
  - type: foreground_pixel
    description: A pixel with a color other than white (0).
    properties:
      - initial_color: The color of the pixel in the input grid (e.g., 9, 2, 3).
      - position: Coordinates (row, column) within the grid.
      - column_parity: Whether the column index is 'even' or 'odd'.
transformation:
  - type: conditional_color_change
    input: foreground_pixel
    condition: The 'column_parity' of the foreground_pixel's position is 'odd'.
    action: Change the pixel's color to yellow (4).
    condition_else: The 'column_parity' of the foreground_pixel's position is 'even'.
    action_else: Keep the pixel's 'initial_color'.
