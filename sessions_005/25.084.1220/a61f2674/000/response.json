            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions (9x9 in both examples). The background color is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Input Objects:** The primary objects in the input grids are pixels of gray (5) color, scattered across the white background. They sometimes form vertical clusters or appear as isolated points.\n3.  **Output Objects:** The output grids contain pixels of blue (1) and red (2) on a white background. All gray pixels from the input are removed or transformed.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation seems to depend on the *column* in which the gray pixels reside. Specifically, it appears related to the *count* of gray pixels within each column.\n5.  **Color Mapping:**\n    *   Gray pixels (5) in the input column(s) containing the *most* gray pixels are transformed into blue (1) pixels in the output, maintaining their original row positions within that column.\n    *   Gray pixels (5) in the input column(s) containing the *fewest* (but at least one) gray pixels are transformed into red (2) pixels in the output, maintaining their original row positions within that column.\n    *   Gray pixels in columns with intermediate counts (neither the maximum nor the minimum non-zero count) are removed (become white (0)) in the output.\n6.  **Example 1 Breakdown:**\n    *   Input counts per column (only non-zero): Col 0: 7, Col 2: 2, Col 4: 9, Col 6: 6.\n    *   Max count: 9 (Col 4). Min count: 2 (Col 2).\n    *   Output: Gray pixels in Col 4 become blue (1). Gray pixels in Col 2 become red (2). Gray pixels in Col 0 and Col 6 become white (0).\n7.  **Example 2 Breakdown:**\n    *   Input counts per column (only non-zero): Col 0: 6, Col 2: 8, Col 4: 4, Col 6: 6, Col 8: 3.\n    *   Max count: 8 (Col 2). Min count: 3 (Col 8).\n    *   Output: Gray pixels in Col 2 become blue (1). Gray pixels in Col 8 become red (2). Gray pixels in Col 0, Col 4, and Col 6 become white (0).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
