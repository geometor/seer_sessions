task_elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - size: constant between input and output
  - element: gray_pixels
    source: input
    value: 5
    distribution: scattered, sometimes clustered vertically
  - element: blue_pixels
    source: output
    value: 1
    derivation: transformation of gray pixels
  - element: red_pixels
    source: output
    value: 2
    derivation: transformation of gray pixels
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input_object: gray_pixels
    output_object: blue_pixels or red_pixels or white_pixels (background)
    condition: based on column properties
  - type: property_calculation
    scope: columns of the input grid
    property: count of gray pixels
    result: numerical count per column
  - type: column_selection
    criteria:
      - maximum count of gray pixels (identifies columns for blue transformation)
      - minimum non-zero count of gray pixels (identifies columns for red transformation)
actions:
  - action: count
    target: gray pixels within each column of the input grid
  - action: compare
    target: counts across columns to find maximum and minimum non-zero values
  - action: transform
    source_pixel: gray (5)
    target_pixel: blue (1)
    condition: pixel is in a column with the maximum gray count
    location: same row and column as the source gray pixel
  - action: transform
    source_pixel: gray (5)
    target_pixel: red (2)
    condition: pixel is in a column with the minimum non-zero gray count
    location: same row and column as the source gray pixel
  - action: transform
    source_pixel: gray (5)
    target_pixel: white (0)
    condition: pixel is in a column whose gray count is neither the maximum nor the minimum non-zero count
    location: same row and column as the source gray pixel
