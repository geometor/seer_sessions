Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions (9x9 in both examples). The background color is consistently white (0).
2.  **Input Objects:** The primary objects in the input grids are pixels of gray (5) color, scattered across the white background. They sometimes form vertical clusters or appear as isolated points.
3.  **Output Objects:** The output grids contain pixels of blue (1) and red (2) on a white background. All gray pixels from the input are removed or transformed.
4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation seems to depend on the *column* in which the gray pixels reside. Specifically, it appears related to the *count* of gray pixels within each column.
5.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   Gray pixels (5) in the input column(s) containing the *most* gray pixels are transformed into blue (1) pixels in the output, maintaining their original row positions within that column.
    *   Gray pixels (5) in the input column(s) containing the *fewest* (but at least one) gray pixels are transformed into red (2) pixels in the output, maintaining their original row positions within that column.
    *   Gray pixels in columns with intermediate counts (neither the maximum nor the minimum non-zero count) are removed (become white (0)) in the output.
6.  **Example 1 Breakdown:**
    *   Input counts per column (only non-zero): Col 0: 7, Col 2: 2, Col 4: 9, Col 6: 6.
    *   Max count: 9 (Col 4). Min count: 2 (Col 2).
    *   Output: Gray pixels in Col 4 become blue (1). Gray pixels in Col 2 become red (2). Gray pixels in Col 0 and Col 6 become white (0).
7.  **Example 2 Breakdown:**
    *   Input counts per column (only non-zero): Col 0: 6, Col 2: 8, Col 4: 4, Col 6: 6, Col 8: 3.
    *   Max count: 8 (Col 2). Min count: 3 (Col 8).
    *   Output: Gray pixels in Col 2 become blue (1). Gray pixels in Col 8 become red (2). Gray pixels in Col 0, Col 4, and Col 6 become white (0).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Analyze the input grid column by column. For each column, count the number of gray pixels (5). Store these counts, ignoring columns with zero gray pixels.
3.  If no gray pixels were found in any column, return the empty white grid.
4.  Identify the maximum count among the stored column counts.
5.  Identify the minimum count among the stored column counts (must be greater than zero).
6.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
7.  If a pixel is gray (5):
    a.  Determine the count of gray pixels in its column (obtained in step 2).
    b.  If this count matches the maximum count identified in step 4, place a blue pixel (1) at the corresponding position (same row and column) in the output grid.
    c.  If this count matches the minimum count identified in step 5, place a red pixel (2) at the corresponding position (same row and column) in the output grid.
    d.  If the count is neither the maximum nor the minimum non-zero count, leave the corresponding position in the output grid as white (0).
8.  Return the completed output grid.
