*   **Perception:**
    The task involves identifying a specific rectangular pattern within the input grid and repeating this pattern horizontally across the grid to generate the output. The input grids contain a distinct shape or pattern composed of non-white pixels, typically located towards the left side, surrounded by white pixels. The output grid maintains the same dimensions as the input grid but fills the horizontal space by tiling the identified pattern.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: pattern_repetition
    input_grid_properties:
        - contains_non_white_pixels: true
        - non_white_pixels_form_pattern: true
        - pattern_location: typically left-aligned, but defined by bounding box
        - background: white (0)
    output_grid_properties:
        - same_dimensions_as_input: true
        - contains_repeated_pattern: true
    transformation:
        - identify_pattern: Find the smallest rectangular bounding box containing all non-white pixels in the input.
        - pattern_extraction: Extract this bounding box subgrid as the 'pattern'.
        - repetition_axis: horizontal
        - repetition_method: Tiling
        - starting_point: The pattern is first placed in its original position.
        - tiling_logic: The pattern is repeatedly placed immediately to the right of the previous instance.
        - boundary_handling: If a repeated pattern exceeds the grid's right boundary, it is truncated.
        - background_preservation: The area outside the vertical extent of the pattern remains white (or retains its original input state, which is white in these examples).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify the locations (row and column indices) of all non-white pixels in the input grid.
    3.  If there are no non-white pixels, return the output grid as is.
    4.  Determine the minimum row (`r_min`), maximum row (`r_max`), minimum column (`c_min`), and maximum column (`c_max`) among the non-white pixel locations.
    5.  Extract the rectangular subgrid from the input grid spanning rows `r_min` to `r_max` and columns `c_min` to `c_max`. This subgrid is the "pattern". Let its height be `H = r_max - r_min + 1` and width be `W = c_max - c_min + 1`.
    6.  Initialize a variable `current_col` to `c_min + W`. This marks the starting column for the *next* placement of the pattern.
    7.  While `current_col` is less than the total width of the grid:
        a.  Determine the width of the pattern piece to copy in this iteration: `copy_width = min(W, grid_width - current_col)`.
        b.  Select the portion of the pattern to copy: `pattern_piece = pattern[0:H, 0:copy_width]`.
        c.  Place `pattern_piece` onto the output grid starting at row `r_min` and column `current_col`.
        d.  Increment `current_col` by `W` to prepare for the next potential placement.
    8.  Return the modified output grid.
