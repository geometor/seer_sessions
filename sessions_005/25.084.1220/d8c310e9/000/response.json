The input grids contain a distinct shape or pattern composed of non-white pixels, typically located towards the left side, surrounded by white pixels. The output grid maintains the same dimensions as the input grid but fills the horizontal space by tiling the identified pattern.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Extract the rectangular subgrid from the input grid spanning rows `r_min` to `r_max` and columns `c_min` to `c_max`. This subgrid is the \"pattern\". Let its height be `H = r_max - r_min + 1` and width be `W = c_max - c_min + 1`.\n    6.  Initialize a variable `current_col` to `c_min + W`.
