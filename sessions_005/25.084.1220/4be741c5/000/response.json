            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs are rectangular grids of colored pixels (integers 0-9). The outputs are also grids, but they are always either a single column (Nx1) or a single row (1xN).\n2.  **Colors:** The inputs contain several distinct colors, often arranged in large, roughly contiguous blocks. The background color (white, 0) seems irrelevant to the output.\n3.  **Transformation Goal:** The task appears to involve identifying the main colors present in the input grid (excluding white) and arranging them in the output grid based on their spatial layout in the input.\n4.  **Spatial Arrangement:**\n    *   In `train_1` and `train_3`, the color blocks are stacked vertically (top-to-bottom). The output is a column vector reflecting this top-to-bottom order.\n    *   In `train_2`, the color blocks are arranged horizontally (left-to-right). The output is a row vector reflecting this left-to-right order.\n5.  **Noise/Overlap:** There are often pixels of one color within the main block of another color (e.g., azure pixels within the red block in `train_1`). These seem to be ignored; the output reflects the dominant color of each major region.\n6.  **Determining Orientation:** The key challenge is to determine whether the dominant arrangement is vertical or horizontal and then extract the colors in the correct order. Calculating the average row and column coordinates for each color seems like a viable approach. If the average row coordinates differ significantly between colors while column coordinates are similar, it's a vertical arrangement. Conversely, if average column coordinates differ significantly while row coordinates are similar, it's horizontal.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Find the coordinates (row, column) of all pixels matching that color.\n    b.  Calculate the average row index and the average column index for these pixels.

Calculate the range (maximum - minimum) or standard deviation of these column coordinates.\n    c.  Compare the row range/std dev with the column range/std dev.\n    d.  If the row range/std dev is significantly greater than the column range/std dev (or if column range is near zero), classify the arrangement as 'vertical'.\n    e.  Otherwise (if the column range/std dev is significantly greater, or row range is near zero), classify the arrangement as 'horizontal'.\n    f.  (Edge case: If only one color exists, or ranges are both near zero, default to 'vertical').\n4.  **Sort Colors:**\n    a.  If the orientation is 'vertical', sort the unique non-white colors based on their average row coordinate in ascending order (top-to-bottom).\n    b.  If the orientation is 'horizontal', sort the unique non-white colors based on their average column coordinate in ascending order (left-to-right).\n5.  **Construct Output Grid:**\n    a.  If the orientation is 'vertical', create a new grid with N rows and 1 column, where N is the number of unique non-white colors. Fill the column top-to-bottom with the sorted colors.\n    b.  If the orientation is 'horizontal', create a new grid with 1 row and N columns, where N is the number of unique non-white colors. Fill the row left-to-right with the sorted colors.\n6.  **Return** the constructed output grid."
