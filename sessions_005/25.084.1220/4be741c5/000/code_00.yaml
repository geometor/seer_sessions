task_description: Identify the dominant non-white colors in the input grid and arrange them in a single row or column output grid based on their primary spatial arrangement (horizontal or vertical).

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors (0-9).
  - element: pixel
    description: A single cell in the grid with a color value.
  - element: color_block
    description: A large, mostly contiguous region of pixels of the same non-white color.
  - element: arrangement
    description: The spatial layout of the color blocks within the input grid.
    properties:
      - orientation: Can be primarily 'vertical' (top-to-bottom) or 'horizontal' (left-to-right).
      - order: The sequence of colors based on the orientation.

relationships:
  - relationship: determines
    subject: arrangement.orientation
    object: output_grid.shape
    details: Vertical arrangement leads to an Nx1 output grid; horizontal leads to a 1xN output grid.
  - relationship: determines
    subject: arrangement.order
    object: output_grid.colors
    details: The sequence of colors in the output grid matches the spatial order (top-to-bottom or left-to-right) of the color blocks in the input.
  - relationship: computation
    subject: color_pixels
    object: average_coordinates
    details: Calculate the average row and column index for all pixels of a specific non-white color.
  - relationship: comparison
    subject: average_coordinates
    object: arrangement.orientation
    details: Comparing the range (or variance) of average row coordinates vs. average column coordinates across colors determines the primary orientation.
  - relationship: sorting
    subject: average_coordinates
    object: arrangement.order
    details: Sorting colors based on their average row (for vertical) or average column (for horizontal) determines the output order.

properties:
  - property: ignored_color
    value: white (0)
    applies_to: pixel
  - property: output_shape
    value: Nx1 or 1xN
    applies_to: grid (output)

actions:
  - action: identify_colors
    description: Find all unique non-white colors present in the input grid.
  - action: calculate_centroids
    description: For each non-white color, calculate the centroid (average row, average column) of its pixels.
  - action: determine_orientation
    description: Compare the spread (e.g., range) of centroid row coordinates vs. column coordinates to determine if the layout is primarily vertical or horizontal.
  - action: sort_colors
    description: Order the identified colors based on their centroid coordinates according to the determined orientation (top-to-bottom for vertical, left-to-right for horizontal).
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create the output grid (Nx1 for vertical, 1xN for horizontal) containing the sorted colors.
