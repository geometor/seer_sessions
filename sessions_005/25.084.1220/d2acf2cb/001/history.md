Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0), magenta (6), yellow (4), orange (7), and azure (8). Black and other colors are not present in these examples.
2.  **Key Color - Yellow (4):** Yellow pixels seem to act as markers or delimiters. Their positions are important.
3.  **Conditional Transformation:** The transformation rule appears to change based on the presence or absence of orange (7) and/or azure (8) pixels in the *input* grid.
4.  **Two Transformation Rules:**
    *   Rule A (applied when 7 or 8 are present in input): Changes orange (7) to magenta (6) and azure (8) to white (0).
    *   Rule B (applied when 7 or 8 are absent in input): Changes white (0) to azure (8) and magenta (6) to orange (7).
5.  **Application Area:** The area where the transformation is applied also seems conditional:
    *   In train\_1 (Rule A applies): The changes occur strictly *between* pairs of yellow (4) pixels found on the same row.
    *   In train\_2 (Rule B applies): There is only one horizontal pair of yellow (4) pixels. The changes occur strictly *between* this pair.
    *   In train\_3 (Rule B applies): There are multiple horizontal pairs of yellow (4) pixels (in different rows). The changes occur in the *columns* containing any yellow pixels, but *excluding* the *rows* that contain yellow pixels.
