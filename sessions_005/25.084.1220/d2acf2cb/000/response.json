Black and other colors are not present in these examples.\n2.  **Key Color - Yellow (4):** Yellow pixels seem to act as markers or delimiters. Their positions are important.\n3.  **Conditional Transformation:** The transformation rule appears to change based on the presence or absence of orange (7) and/or azure (8) pixels in the *input* grid.\n4.  **Two Transformation Rules:**\n    *   Rule A (applied when 7 or 8 are present in input): Changes orange (7) to magenta (6) and azure (8) to white (0).\n    *   Rule B (applied when 7 or 8 are absent in input): Changes white (0) to azure (8) and magenta (6) to orange (7).\n5.  **Application Area:** The area where the transformation is applied also seems conditional:\n    *   In train\\_1 (Rule A applies): The changes occur strictly *between* pairs of yellow (4) pixels found on the same row.\n    *   In train\\_2 (Rule B applies): There is only one horizontal pair of yellow (4) pixels. The changes occur strictly *between* this pair.\n    *   In train\\_3 (Rule B applies): There are multiple horizontal pairs of yellow (4) pixels (in different rows). The changes occur in the *columns* containing any yellow pixels, but *excluding* the *rows* that contain yellow pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
