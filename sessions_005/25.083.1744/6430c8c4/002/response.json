However, the transformation is not rotating the grid section above the divider which causes a mismatch with expected output. The program also is misunderstanding where to apply color substitutions (orange is not being replaced with green correctly).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Color Substitution:**\n    Review each example and check if the output substitutes all the '7' with '3'.\n    It seems that sometimes there is an extra rotation involved, but the details need further investigation.\n2.  **Incorporate Rotation:**\n    The transformation is missing a step - 90 degree rotation anti-clockwise.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis (using code execution):**\n\nIt's difficult to get quantitative results from the current tool. The provided information is very useful. We could develop some code tools if necessary, however, I can already make significant progress with what is provided.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
