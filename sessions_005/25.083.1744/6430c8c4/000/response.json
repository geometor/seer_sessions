The top section contains '7' (orange) and '0' (white), while the bottom section contains '2' (red) and '0' (white).\n*   The output grids consist only of '3' (green) and '0' (white).\n*   The output grids seem to be related to the upper portion of input, specifically the 7s.\n*\t  The lower section (with 2s) appears to be discarded or ignored in the transformation.\n*   The size of output grid is smaller than the input grid, the divider (4s)\n    is not present in the output\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
