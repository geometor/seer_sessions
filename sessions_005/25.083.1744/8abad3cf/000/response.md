Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation logic. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits, representing colored pixels.
*   The shapes and sizes of the input and output grids differ.
*   There's a change in the arrangement and, in some cases, the number of specific colors.
*    In the first example, train\_1, the input grid is 7x7, the output is 4x10
*    In the second example, train\_2, the input grid is 7x4, the output is 3x6.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - contains: colored pixels (represented by digits)
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
  - type: objects
    properties:
      - definition: contiguous blocks of same-colored pixels
      - attributes: color, shape, size, position
  - type: transformation
    properties:
      - action: rearrangement and/or removal of pixels
      - change: grid dimensions may change
      - change: color counts may change
      - trigger: appears to be deterministic (no randomness)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze Input:** Examine the input grid, identifying distinct objects (contiguous blocks of the same color).
2.  **Isolate Left and Right:** The concept appears to be a segmentation, and reordering based on a vertical division of the grid. Split the Input grid into a Left side, and a Right side. The determination of where the split occurs is not clear.
3.    **Mirror and Invert**: A mirrored and inverted version of the Left side becomes the new Right side of the Output grid.
4. The Right side of the input is reordered to become the Left side of the output. The Right Side's bottom portion is discarded, retaining the original top portion.

The main challenge is to derive a general, complete rule on how the split is made and applied, which might require analyzing additional examples. The current program works from simple observations, but needs more details for completion.
