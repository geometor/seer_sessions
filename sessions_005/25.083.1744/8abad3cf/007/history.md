Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code have a fundamental flaw: they assume the first row of the right side should always be prepended to the mirrored left side. The errors (`ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`) are arising from using `if first_row_right` to check the existence, numpy array does not evaluate like a list. The `if` statement doesn't behave as expected because `first_row_right` is a NumPy array, not a simple boolean or empty list check. Also, even if we fix that, prepending only makes sense when the example requires it. We need to examine all examples to understand when prepending happens and when it doesn't.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Fix the NumPy array check:** Modify the conditional logic to check the result correctly. The condition should check the length.
2.  **Analyze all Examples:** Critically, we must examine *all* training examples, not just the first one, to determine the *rule* for combining the extracted row and the mirrored half. It's likely a conditional rule, not a universal prepending.
3. **Refine Program:** Update the natural language program and code based on the complete analysis.

**Gather Metrics and Example Analysis:**

I need to see the actual input/output grids to understand the transformation. I'll use code execution to print the dimensions and content of the grids in each example. This is crucial to figure out the *conditional* part of the transformation rule.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Split:** Divide the input grid vertically into two halves (left and right). The right half will always include the middle column if the input has an odd number of columns.
2.  **Mirror:** Mirror the left half of the input grid horizontally.
3.  **Extract:** Extract the first row from the right half of the input grid.
4.  **Prepend:**  Prepend the extracted row (from Step 3) to the mirrored left half (from Step 2).

The key change is changing "Combine" to explicit "Prepend". It appears that prepending the first row is ALWAYS the operation performed.
