1.  **Split:** Divide the input grid vertically into two halves (left and right).
2.  **Mirror:** Mirror the left half of the input grid horizontally.
3.  **Calculate Output Rows of the Left Portion:** Subtract the output row count from the input row count. The result equals the number of rows from the right portion to be taken.
4. **Extract**: Take a section, starting from the top, of the right half. The number of rows extracted is defined in step 3.
5.  **Combine:** Combine the extracted part from Step 4 and mirrored part from Step 2. The extracted part is placed to the left of the mirrored part.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a hypothesis derived from the first training example.  The errors encountered in subsequent examples ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()") strongly suggest a flaw in a conditional statement or a boolean operation.  Specifically, the `output_rows` calculation: `output_rows = len(input_grid) - len(input_grid) + (len(input_grid) - len(get_top_portion(input_grid, 0 if not input_grid else len(input_grid[0]) - (0 if not left_side else len(left_side[0])))))` seems problematic, likely due to how arrays are being handled within conditional checks (the `if not input_grid` and `if not left_side` parts).  It's trying to treat entire arrays as single boolean values, which is incorrect.

The core strategy is to:

1.  **Debug `output_rows`:** Simplify and correctly determine the logic for calculating how many rows to take from the right side. This likely involves comparing dimensions of the input and output grids in each example, rather than trying to derive it all in one complex, error-prone expression. We will use direct measurements from input/output.
2.  **Re-evaluate the Natural Language Program:**  After fixing the core logic, we'll revise the natural language program to accurately reflect the corrected transformation.
3. **Example Specific Debugging**: We need to run the code for each example and the test, capturing dimensions, and identify objects.

**Gather Metrics & Debugging:**

Let's use `tool_code` to get the dimensions of the input and output grids for each example, and also to inspect the intermediate results of `split_grid_vertical`, `mirror_horizontal`, and `get_top_portion`. This will help pinpoint exactly where the logic breaks down.

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Split:** Divide the input grid vertically into two equal halves (left and right).
2.  **Mirror:** Mirror the left half of the input grid horizontally.
3.  **Extract:** Extract the first row from the right half of the input grid.
4.  **Combine:**  Combine the extracted row (from Step 3) with the mirrored left half (from Step 2). The extracted row is placed to the *left* of the mirrored half.

The key change is simplifying the row extraction: it's always just the *first* row of the right half. The original program's complex calculation was unnecessary and incorrect. The error in the previous version was in the logic to derive the `output_row` count.
