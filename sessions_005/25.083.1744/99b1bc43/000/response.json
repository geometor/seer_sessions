The input grids seem to be divided into two distinct sections based on color. The top section contains blues (1) and whites (0), and a middle row of yellow (4). The bottom section contains red (2) and white (0). The output grid consistently uses only green (3) and white (0). The output grid's size appears related to the upper section of the input grid, specifically a quarter of the original (half the height and half the width). It also seems some kind of pattern involving the first colors.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
