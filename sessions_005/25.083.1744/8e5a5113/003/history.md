Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were based on a flawed understanding of the mirroring process. The code attempts an interleaving approach, which is incorrect. The errors in all three examples show that the mirroring is not happening as intended. The core issue is how the columns to the right of the mirror column ('5') are populated. Instead of a direct, column-by-column reflection, the code tries a more complex, and ultimately wrong, alternating placement.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct the Mirroring Logic:** The primary focus should be on fixing the way the right side of the output grid is constructed. The correct approach is a simple, direct reflection of the left side onto the right side, using the '5' column as the axis of symmetry.
2.  **Re-evaluate Interleaving:** The initial assumption of interleaving columns should be discarded.
3.  **Simplify the Code:** The current code is more complex than necessary. The corrected logic should lead to a simpler and more readable implementation.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To understand the errors better, let's analyze each example pair. I'll use python code execution to compute distances and differences between expected and transformed grids.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents the initial state. Contains a vertical line of '5's (gray pixels) serving as a mirror.
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents the transformed state. It's a mirrored version of the input_grid.
  - property: mirror_column
    value: Column index containing all '5's.
    description: Acts as the axis of reflection.
  - action: reflection
    description: The left side of the input_grid (excluding the mirror column) is reflected onto the right side of the output_grid. The reflection is performed column-wise. The portion of the grid that is left to the vertical line of 5s, is mirrored to the other part, taking the vertical 5s line as an axis.
  - observation: input_output_width
    description: In all training samples, the input and output grids have the same width and height.
  - observation: column_symmetry
    description: The number of columns to be mirrored seems to be equal on both sides of the '5' column.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Mirror Column:** Find the column in the input grid that consists entirely of the value '5' (gray pixels). This is the "mirror column".
2.  **Reflect the Left Side:** For each row, take the pixels to the left of the mirror column and reflect them onto the right side of the mirror column, maintaining the same row. The mirroring should be a direct reflection: the pixel immediately to the left of the mirror column becomes the pixel immediately to the right, the second pixel to the left becomes the second pixel to the right, and so on. The number of elements to the left of the mirror column will always be the same of the number of elements between the two lines of 5's (gray pixels).
3.  **Preserve the mirror and the right columns:** The mirror column and the columns on the right side of the input are copied unchanged to the output.

This program describes a simple, direct reflection. It avoids the incorrect interleaving concept and clearly defines the transformation.
