Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize an update to the natural language program and code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code were based on the idea of expanding each pixel into a 2x2 block. However, the results across multiple examples clearly show this isn't consistently correct. The generated outputs have the correct dimensions, color palette, and color counts, but the pixel arrangement within the expanded blocks is wrong. The error pattern doesn't look like a simple offset or mirroring, suggesting the initial assumption about 2x2 expansion was either flawed or incomplete. It looks like some kind of tiling that needs a better description.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully look at all input-output pairs to identify the *precise* transformation rule. Pay close attention to how individual pixels in the input relate to 2x2 blocks in the output and their arrangement.
2.  **Identify the Pattern:** Discard the simple 2x2 expansion idea and seek an alternative, more precise mapping rule, maybe based on some rotation.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Revise the natural language description to reflect the correct transformation.
4.  **Update Code:** Modify the Python code to implement the new, corrected transformation.

**Gather Metrics (using assumptions):**

I'll use a simplified approach to describe the apparent transformation (based on visual inspection without tool use, for now), and then use code to verify some assumptions. The apparent transformation isn't a simple expansion. Instead, each 2x2 square looks like a kind of rotated/mirrored version of a 2x2 "seed" derived from the upper-left 2x2 sub-matrix of the input.

Let us describe the transformations.

**Example 1:**

Input:


```
2 5 2
2 6 4
2 2 2
```


Expected Output:


```
2 5 2 2 5 2
2 6 4 4 6 2
2 2 2 2 2 2
2 2 2 2 2 2
2 6 4 4 6 2
2 5 2 2 5 2
```

The upper-left 2x2 matrix of the output is


```
2 5
2 6
```

The 2x2 sub-matrices to the right appear to be horizontal reflections

```
2 5 -> 5 2
2 6 -> 6 2
```

And, the 2x2 sub-matrices in the rows below looks like a reflection:

```
2 5
2 6
->
2 2
2 6
```


**Example 2:**

Input:


```
7 1 5
7 7 1
5 3 1
```


Expected Output:


```
7 1 5 5 1 7
7 7 1 1 7 7
5 3 1 1 3 5
5 3 1 1 3 5
7 7 1 1 7 7
7 1 5 5 1 7
```


Upper Left 2x2

```
7 1
7 7
```


Right Reflection


```
7 1 -> 1 7
7 7 -> 7 7
```

Bottom Reflection:


```
7 1
7 7
->
5 3
5 3
```

This is not just reflection but rather it involves changes of color values. It looks we are rotating around columns, rows, and diagonals.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid's dimensions are double the input grid's dimensions (2x height and 2x width).
  - observation: |
      The transformation involves a more complex relationship than simple pixel expansion.
  - observation: |
      The colors in the output grid are a subset of the colors in the input grid.
  - observation: |
    The arrangement appears to follow a mirrored pattern, but not consistent across different regions of the grid.
  - observation: example_1: |
      Input upper-left 2x2:  [[2, 5], [2, 6]].
      Output 2x2 blocks appear to be based on transformations and reflections of the input's corresponding values.
  - hypothesis: |
      The transformation involves creating 2x2 blocks in the output based on potentially mirrored/rotated versions of 2x2 sections of the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double Dimensions:** The output grid has twice the height and twice the width of the input grid.
2.  **2x2 Block Transformation:** Divide both the input and output grids into non-overlapping 2x2 blocks.
3. **Mapping:** The mapping appears more complex, and might involves a rotation transformation. It appears to replicate each 2x2 block based on different rotations of a "seed" based on the upper-left of the input, then fill out the rest of the output array.
4.  **Refined Description Needed:** The precise transformation needs a better definition that takes into account the relationship between the columns of the input grid and the repetition of the 2x2 pattern.
