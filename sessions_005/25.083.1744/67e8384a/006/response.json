            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize an update to the natural language program and code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code were based on the idea of expanding each pixel into a 2x2 block. However, the results across multiple examples clearly show this isn't consistently correct. The generated outputs have the correct dimensions, color palette, and color counts, but the pixel arrangement within the expanded blocks is wrong. The error pattern doesn't look like a simple offset or mirroring, suggesting the initial assumption about 2x2 expansion was either flawed or incomplete. It looks like some kind of tiling that needs a better description.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully look at all input-output pairs to identify the *precise* transformation rule. Pay close attention to how individual pixels in the input relate to 2x2 blocks in the output and their arrangement.\n2.  **Identify the Pattern:** Discard the simple 2x2 expansion idea and seek an alternative, more precise mapping rule, maybe based on some rotation.\n3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Revise the natural language description to reflect the correct transformation.\n4.  **Update Code:** Modify the Python code to implement the new, corrected transformation.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using assumptions):**\n\nI'll use a simplified approach to describe the apparent transformation (based on visual inspection without tool use, for now), and then use code to verify some assumptions. The apparent transformation isn't a simple expansion. Instead, each 2x2 square looks like a kind of rotated/mirrored version of a 2x2 \"seed\" derived from the upper-left 2x2 sub-matrix of the input.\n\nLet us describe the transformations.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\nInput:\n\n"
