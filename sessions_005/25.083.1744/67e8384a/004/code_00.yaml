facts:
  - description: "Each pixel in the input grid is expanded into a 2x2 block in the output grid."
  - observation: "The output grid is twice the height and twice the width of the input grid."
  - color_counts: "The count of each color in the output grid is exactly four times its count in the input grid."
  - object_interaction: "Each pixel (object) from input becomes 4 pixels of the same value in the output"
  - spatial_relation: "The expansion seems to follow a quadrant and mirroring pattern"
  - quadrants: "Each expanded pixel in the output grid exists in the top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right positions relative to where a single pixel of that value appears in the input"
