    analysis: |
      The output grid is twice the size of the input grid in both dimensions.
      Each pixel in the input seems to generate a 2x2 block.
      Input rows are repeated and reversed in the expanded version.
      Input columns are repeated and reversed.
      Row 0 of the input corresponds to rows 0 and 5 of the output.
      Row 1 of the input corresponds to rows 1 and 4 of the output.
      Row 2 of the input corresponds to rows 2 and 3 of the output.
      The input grid is expanded by a factor of 2.
      The expansion is not a simple duplication, but it involves horizontal and vertical reflection.
      Specifically it does the following
        - Horizontal Flip
        - Vertical Flip
        - Combination of both.
    transformation_type: geometric reflection, expansion
