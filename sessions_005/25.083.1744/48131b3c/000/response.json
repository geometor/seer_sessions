The core pattern seems to be a replication and expansion of the input grid. The non-zero values in the input grid appear to dictate the pattern in the output grid, while the zero values in the input seem to act as separators or spacers in the expanded output. The output grid's dimensions are related to the input grid's dimensions, seemingly through multiplication. The relative positions of the non-zero elements within the input grid seem very important to maintaining relative output positions.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
