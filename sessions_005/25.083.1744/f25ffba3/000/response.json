Here's my breakdown of the input-output pair, including my perception, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements**\n\n*   The input and output grids are of the same dimensions (10x4).\n*   The input grid contains a sequence of colored pixels that seems to move.\n* The color of the solid block is composed of four pixels of color:\n    *   blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4), azure (8), maroon (9)\n*   The output grid shows a \"trace\" or \"history\" of the movement of that block.\n*   The transformation appears to involve some kind of mirroring or reflection of an object's motion path.\n* Each output is using the bottom most rows of the input as the top rows in the output\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts**\n\n"

Note its initial position and the colors it is comprised of, there will be four unique colors.\n2.  **Trace the Path:** Record the shape's row position in the input.\n3.  **Reflect the Path:** Invert the order of rows recorded, and fill the output using those inverted positions.\n4. **Fill the output:** Place the object in the output in the new postion, maintaining the same relative position and color. Repeat filling until the the entirity of the output has the shape.\n\nIn essence, the transformation takes the movement path of the colored block, reverses it, and uses that reversed path to construct the output, as if the motion were mirrored across a horizontal axis at the initial position of the line.\n"
