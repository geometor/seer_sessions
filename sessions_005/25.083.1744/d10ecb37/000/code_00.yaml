objects:
  - type: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors
    actions:
      - observed: none (passive)

  - type: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2 x 2
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors, derived from input_grid
    actions:
      - observed: none (result of transformation)

  - type: color_pair
     properties:
        - first: color observed in input_grid
        - second: next adjacent color, different color, observed in input_grid

relationships:
  - type: derivation
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    description: The output_grid is derived from the input_grid through a transformation rule.
  - type: contains
    source: input_grid
    target: color_pair
    description: color_pair is a sequence of adjacent colors
