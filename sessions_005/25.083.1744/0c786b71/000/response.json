Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs and outputs are grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.\n*   The input grids are smaller (3x4) than the output grids (6x8 or 8x8).\n*   The output grids seem to be a patterned expansion of the input grids.\n*   The digits from input grid seem to form some kind of object, which gets duplicated to the output grid according to some pattern.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
