The output grid seems to be a consistently sized 3x3 grid, regardless of the input grid's dimensions. The output grid's colors appear to be derived from a specific object or region within the input grid. The most significant observation is that there are distinct \"blocks\" or \"objects\" of color within the input, and a single such object consistently re-appears in the output. The background color is consistently white (0). Objects always have colors appearing in a rectangular formation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
