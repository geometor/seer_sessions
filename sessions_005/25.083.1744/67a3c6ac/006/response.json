While this concept is partially correct, the results indicate a flaw in its execution. The code swaps *every* element with its symmetric counterpart, leading to double-swapping and, effectively, often returning a grid close to the original input.  The errors are not random; the output grids resemble flipped versions of the expected outputs, showing the symmetry logic is active but misapplied. The strategy should be adjusted to correctly implement the symmetrical mirroring.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Analysis (using a more systematic approach):**\n\nTo better understand the error, let's focus on what is done correctly and incorrectly by examining differences between symmetric pairs.\n\n"

A cell at position (i, j) has the symmetric opposite at (rows - 1 - i, cols - 1 - j).  *Only* perform a swap if the original cell's value is different to the expected value of the symmetrically opposite cell. Critically, after performing a swap, do not swap the elements back. This prevents the double-swapping error. This can be achieved by only iterating through one \"half\" of the grid (e.g. for elements where the row index `i` is strictly less than `rows - 1 - i`. If `i` is equal to `rows-1-i`, consider elements where the col index `j` is strictly less than `cols-1-j`).\n"
