example_1:
  input_shape: [7, 7]
  output_shape: [7, 7]
  objects:
      - color_blocks: Identified by distinct colors (1, 2, 6, 7)
  transformations:
      - positional_changes: Complex rearrangement of color blocks, not a simple rotation or reflection.
  invariants:
    - output_shape: same as input shape
example_2:
  input_shape: [4, 4]
  output_shape: [4, 4]
  objects:
    - color_blocks: Identified by distinct colors (1, 2, 6, 7)
  transformations:
    - positional_changes:  Rearrangement, possibly a complex reflection or combination of transformations.
  invariants:
      - output_shape: same as input shape
example_3:
  input_shape: [6, 6]
  output_shape: [6, 6]
  objects:
    - color_blocks: Identified by distinct colors (1, 2, 6, 7)
  transformations:
    - positional_changes: Complex rearrangement - not a simple rotation, reflection, or column flip.
  invariants:
    - output_shape: same as input shape
