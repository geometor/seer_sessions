facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have identical dimensions for each example.
  - observation: The set of colors present in the input grid is the same as the set of colors in the output grid, but their positions are rearranged.
  - observation: The transformation isn't a simple geometric operation like rotation or reflection.
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: (rows, columns)
      - elements: 2D array of integers (0-9)
    actions:
      - color_remapping:  The positions of colors are changed according to a specific rule.
  - relationship: Input grid transforms to output grid via color_remapping.
