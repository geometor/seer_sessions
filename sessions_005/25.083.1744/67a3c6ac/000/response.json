Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.\n*   The input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example pair, but dimensions vary between different pairs.\n*   The transformation appears to involve a systematic swapping or rearrangement of pixel colors within the grid. It's not a simple rotation, reflection, or color substitution. It seems like the *positions* of colors are being remapped.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

The transformation rule appears to involve swapping the positions of the digits based on their original locations, reading digits from left to right.\n\nIn the first pair, the digits in input are transposed and reversed.\n7 7 7 6 6 6 2 -> 2 6 6 6 7 7 7\n6 7 1 1 7 7 1 -> 1 7 7 1 1 7 6\n7 7 2 1 2 6 6 -> 6 6 2 1 2 7 7\n2 2 7 7 7 2 2 -> 2 2 7 7 7 2 2\n7 2 7 1 2 7 2 -> 2 7 2 1 7 2 7\n6 6 6 2 2 1 1 -> 1 1 2 2 6 6 6\n6 2 6 6 6 6 6 -> 6 6 6 6 6 2 6\n\nThe output grid seems to follow a pattern: read the input grid from left to right. The first line of the output comes from reversing the first row, the 2nd line from reversing the 2nd line etc.\n\nThe transformation swaps the rows and the columns and also reverses the order.\n\nThis program assumes that the input grid is transposed and each line reversed to create the output grid.\n"
