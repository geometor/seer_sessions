            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe core element appears to be a transformation of a small input grid into a larger output grid. The output grid seems to be a patterned expansion of the input grid. The pattern involves repeating the input grid multiple times horizontally and potentially altering the order of rows and the colors used. The colors in the output grid seem to be the same as those present in the input grid.  A crucial observation is that the output grid's width is always 12, irrespective of the input grid's dimensions. The height of the output is same as input.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
