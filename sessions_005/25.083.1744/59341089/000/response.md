Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The core element appears to be a transformation of a small input grid into a larger output grid. The output grid seems to be a patterned expansion of the input grid. The pattern involves repeating the input grid multiple times horizontally and potentially altering the order of rows and the colors used. The colors in the output grid seem to be the same as those present in the input grid.  A crucial observation is that the output grid's width is always 12, irrespective of the input grid's dimensions. The height of the output is same as input.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        rows: variable (3 in examples)
        columns: variable (3 in examples)
        colors: [0-9] (limited set from input)
  - output_grid:
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        rows: same as input_grid rows
        columns: 12 (fixed)
        colors: same as input_grid colors

actions:
  - expand:
      input: input_grid
      output: output_grid
      description: Creates the output grid by repeating input, modifying rows and colors

relationships:
  - input_to_output_size: output width is always 12, height matches input
  - color_preservation: colors in output are present in input
  - pattern_expansion: output is a patterned repetition of a modified input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid with a width of 12 and height same as input grid.
2.  **Horizontal Repetition:** The input grid is repeated four times horizontally to form the 12 columns of output.
3. **Row ordering**: The ordering of rows in input is preserved in output.
4. **Color Preservation:** The colors are directly copied, maintaining their relative positions within each repetition of the input pattern.

In essence, the transformation rule takes the input grid, repeats it four times horizontally while preserving the row order and color positions to achieve the consistent output grid width of 12 and height equal to input height.
