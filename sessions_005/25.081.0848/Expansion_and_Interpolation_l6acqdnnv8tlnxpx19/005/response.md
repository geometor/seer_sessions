"""
1.  **Identify Colored Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of non-zero colored pixels within the input grid. A region is defined as a group of one or more pixels of the same color that are directly adjacent (not diagonally).

2.  **Edge Expansion:** For each identified colored region:
    *   Find the shortest path from each pixel in the color region to each edge (top, bottom, left, right).
    *   Fill in the output grid along this shortest path to each edge with pixels of the same color.

3.  **Output:** The resulting grid is the transformed output. This effectively expands each colored region until it touches all edges of the grid, maintaining the original shape as much as possible within the constraints of the grid boundaries. The expansion will create the shortest path.
