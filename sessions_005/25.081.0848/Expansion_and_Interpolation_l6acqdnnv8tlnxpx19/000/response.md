Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids where each cell contains a single digit representing a color. The transformation seems to involve a single color in the input grid (other than black/0) becoming predominant in the output grid. The position and shape of the original color seem to influence, but don't fully determine, the output. It is a single color flooding.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are 5x5.
  - observation: Output grids are 5x5.
  - observation: Input grids contain a single non-zero color forming a connected shape.
  - observation: Output grids contain the same non-zero color as their corresponding input, but it fills the entire grid border and some of the inner cells.
  - observation: The color '0' (black) acts as a background/empty space.
  - relationship: Input and Output grids maintain the same dimensions.
  - relationship: The single input object "floods" taking pixels from the background.
  - action: Color value of input is applied according to the background.
  - action: Last row and last column of output are the non-zero color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single non-zero color present in the input grid.
2.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  Fill the last row of output grid with the identified non-zero color.
4.  Fill the last column of output grid with the identified non-zero color.
5.  Iterate on input grid, if any color other than background ('0'), set corresponding output pixel to same color.
