The core issue seems to be an oversimplification in how the non-zero color is propagated. The initial logic assumes we only need to fill the last row and column. However, the second and third examples show a pattern of extending the existing non-zero colored pixels to the edges, effectively \"framing\" the original shape with the same color, or taking a flood fill from the edge. We need to discern which pixels should determine the edges.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Analysis**\n\nI need to understand the relationship between the input and output grids more precisely. Let's do a pixel-by-pixel comparison to find where the errors are and identify properties for edge detection.\n\n"

This effectively expands each colored region until it touches all edges of the grid, maintaining the original shape as much as possible within the constraints of the grid boundaries. The expansion will create the shortest path.\n\nThis revised program accounts for the \"framing\" behavior observed in all examples, where the existing colors extend to touch all edges. It doesn't rely on simply filling the last row and column but considers the position of the existing color in the input to fill the edges.\n"
