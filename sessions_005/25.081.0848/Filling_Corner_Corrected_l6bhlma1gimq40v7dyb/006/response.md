Okay, let's analyze the results of the `code_00.py` execution and refine the natural language program and strategy.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a "reflection" or "extension" concept related to yellow objects and grid boundaries. The results show inconsistencies across the examples, indicating that the logic is incomplete or incorrect. Specifically, the placement and shape of the added red pixels don't consistently match the expected outputs. The strategy should involve:

1.  **Re-examining the relationship:** Instead of a simple reflection, we need to carefully analyze the *spatial relationship* between the yellow objects and the added red pixels in *each* example. There might be a combination of mirroring, extending, and adjacency rules.
2.  **Object Interaction:** Check to see if the objects interact with each other - it is possible that they don't and it may simplify the solution.
3.  **Boundary Conditions:** Clarify the exact rules for when a yellow object is near a boundary versus when it's not. The current code seems to have some logic for this, but it's not entirely correct.
4.  **Shape Matching:** The added red pixels often seem to form shapes related to the yellow objects, but not always direct reflections. We need to understand how the shapes are derived.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution)**

I'll use a `tool_code` block to analyze a simplified form of inputs/outputs to help see the metrics.

import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output, example_num):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)
    yellow_objects = []
    red_pixels_added = []

    # Find yellow objects
    visited = np.zeros_like(input_grid, dtype=bool)
    for r in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
        for c in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
            if input_grid[r, c] == 4 and not visited[r, c]:
                obj = []
                stack = [(r, c)]
                while stack:
                    y, x = stack.pop()
                    if 0 <= y < input_grid.shape[0] and 0 <= x < input_grid.shape[1] and input_grid[y, x] == 4 and not visited[y, x]:
                        visited[y, x] = True
                        obj.append((y, x))
                        stack.extend([(y + 1, x), (y - 1, x), (y, x + 1), (y, x - 1)])
                yellow_objects.append(obj)

    # Find added red pixels
    for r in range(expected_output.shape[0]):
        for c in range(expected_output.shape[1]):
            if expected_output[r, c] == 2 and input_grid[r, c] != 2:
                red_pixels_added.append((r, c))

    print(f"Example {example_num}:")
    print(f"  Yellow Objects: {yellow_objects}")
    print(f"  Added Red Pixels: {red_pixels_added}")

    # Calculate distances and relationships (add more as needed)
    for i, obj in enumerate(yellow_objects):
        min_row = min(y for y, x in obj)
        max_row = max(y for y, x in obj)
        min_col = min(x for y, x in obj)
        max_col = max(x for y, x in obj)

        print(f"  Object {i+1}:")
        print(f"    Bounding Box: ({min_row}, {min_col}) - ({max_row}, {max_col})")

      relationship: |
        The red pixels appear to "complete" lines extending from the yellow object, towards the top and left edges. The shape isn't a simple reflection; rather an extension in available space.
    - example_2:
      yellow_objects:
        - bounding_box: (2, 1) - (3, 2)
          shape: "L-shape"

      red_pixels:
        - positions: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)]
        - description: "Red pixels appear above and to the right of the yellow object."
      relationship: |
       Red pixels are placed on rows/columns adjacent to the yellow pixels, extending the yellow object shape in directions where there's open space at the ends of lines forming the yellow object.
    - example_3:
      yellow_objects:

      red_pixels:
        - positions: [(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)]
        - description: "Red pixels extend left from the top of yellow and down from right side of yellow"
      relationship: |
         Red extends the shape of the yellow to adjacent rows/cols.
  - interaction: "Objects do not appear to interact"

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Yellow Objects:** Locate all contiguous groups of yellow (color 4) pixels. Consider each group as a separate object.
2.  **Extend Lines:** For each yellow object:
    *   Examine the pixels that form the object. If the object forms any lines of length 1 or more consider their endpoints.
    *   For each line's end-points, extend red pixels into empty adjacent cells in the direction established by the line, until the edge of the grid is reached. The line must be on a single row or column.
    *   The color of the filled pixels should be red (color 2).
3. **Object Independence:** Objects do not interact. Each extension of red pixels is dependent only on the shape and position of a single yellow object.
