    - example_1:
      yellow_objects:
        - bounding_box: (0, 0) - (1, 1)  # Top-left corner
          shape: "L-shape"
          pixels: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)]
      red_pixels:
        - positions: [(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0)]
        - description: "Red pixels fill the remaining spaces in the top row and partially down the first column."
      relationship: |
        The red pixels appear to "complete" lines extending from the yellow object, towards the top and left edges. The shape isn't a simple reflection; rather an extension in available space.
    - example_2:
      yellow_objects:
        - bounding_box: (2, 1) - (3, 2)
          shape: "L-shape"
          pixels: [(2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)]
      red_pixels:
        - positions: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)]
        - description: "Red pixels appear above and to the right of the yellow object."
      relationship: |
       Red pixels are placed on rows/columns adjacent to the yellow pixels, extending the yellow object shape in directions where there's open space at the ends of lines forming the yellow object.
    - example_3:
      yellow_objects:
        - bounding_box: (1, 3) - (2, 4)
          shape: "L-shape"
          pixels:  [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4)]
      red_pixels:
        - positions: [(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)]
        - description: "Red pixels extend left from the top of yellow and down from right side of yellow"
      relationship: |
         Red extends the shape of the yellow to adjacent rows/cols.
  - interaction: "Objects do not appear to interact"
