            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the `code_00.py` execution and refine the natural language program and strategy.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on a \"reflection\" or \"extension\" concept related to yellow objects and grid boundaries. The results show inconsistencies across the examples, indicating that the logic is incomplete or incorrect. Specifically, the placement and shape of the added red pixels don't consistently match the expected outputs. The strategy should involve:\n\n1.  **Re-examining the relationship:** Instead of a simple reflection, we need to carefully analyze the *spatial relationship* between the yellow objects and the added red pixels in *each* example. There might be a combination of mirroring, extending, and adjacency rules.\n2.  **Object Interaction:** Check to see if the objects interact with each other - it is possible that they don't and it may simplify the solution.\n3.  **Boundary Conditions:** Clarify the exact rules for when a yellow object is near a boundary versus when it's not. The current code seems to have some logic for this, but it's not entirely correct.\n4.  **Shape Matching:** The added red pixels often seem to form shapes related to the yellow objects, but not always direct reflections. We need to understand how the shapes are derived.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution)**\n\nI'll use a `tool_code` block to analyze a simplified form of inputs/outputs to help see the metrics.\n\n"
