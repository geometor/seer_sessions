            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code aimed to identify yellow (color code 4) objects and then either reflect them across a boundary or extend them if no boundary was touched. The reflection/extension was intended to create red (color code 2) pixels. The current implementation has issues in correctly applying these transformations across all examples. It seems there is a problem with how the code determines when to extend instead of reflect, and the exact mechanics of the reflection and extensions relative to the yellow objects and edges.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** We'll examine each example's input, expected output, and the actual output of the current code. This will help us pinpoint specific discrepancies.\n2.  **Refine Reflection/Extension Logic:** The core of the problem seems to lie in the `reflect_object` function. We need to clarify:\n    *   **Boundary Interaction:** How exactly does touching a boundary affect the reflection? The current logic seems to treat top/bottom touches differently than left/right touches, which may not be universally correct.\n    *   **Extension Logic:** When no boundary is touched, the extension logic is based on maximum distance to a boundary. The current code might have an error when there are equal distrances and might be implementing the extension on the opposite direction.\n    *    Correct row/col index handling when performing operations\n3.  **YAML Fact Documentation:** We'll create a YAML structure that captures key observations about the objects, their properties, and the actions (reflection/extension) performed on them in each example. This structured format helps to transition to the next coding phase.\n4.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** Based on the detailed analysis, we will create an updated natural language program that provides clearer and more accurate instructions for the transformation.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Analyze Examples:**\n\nLet's analyze each example individually, including calculating some helpful metrics using python code. I want to look more closely at pixel counts, to make sure I fully understand what is happening in each example\n\n"

This confirms that the code correctly identifies and preserves yellow objects.\n*   **Red Discrepancy:** The primary difference lies in the number of red pixels (color 2). The transformed output consistently has fewer red pixels than the expected output. The exact difference varies (3, 3, and 2 in the examples), indicating that the reflection/extension logic is not adding enough red pixels.\n*  **Example 1 - Top Edge:** Yellow object touches the top edge.  Red reflection should be at the bottom. It seems that it's creating red pixels at the bottom, but not enough. It created two rows when it should make three. The generated red area is an *offset reflection*, where the row position is not directly mirrored but has constant offset from the top.\n*  **Example 2 - No Edge:** Yellow object is in the middle of grid. Red pixels added above and to the right of the yellow object, should extend the shape. Added only a single pixel above, when it should add two. Added to only one side of object when it should extend on two opposite sides.\n* **Example 3 - Right Edge:** Yellow object touches the right edge. The generated red pixels correctly reflect the object shape on the left, but not enough red pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
