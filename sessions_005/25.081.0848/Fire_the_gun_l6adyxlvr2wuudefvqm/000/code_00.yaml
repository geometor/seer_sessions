facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: Only '0' (white) pixels in the input grid are changed.
  - observation: The changed '0' pixels become '2' (red) pixels.
  - observation: The non-zero pixels ('5' - gray) remain unchanged.
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: rows x columns
      - elements: integers [0-9]
    relations:
      - element_color: "mapped to color names via COLOR_MAP"
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - value: integer [0-9]
      - color: derived from value
      - position: (row, column)
  - action: change_pixel_value
    properties:
      - subject: pixel at specific position
      - from_value: 0
      - to_value: 2
    conditions:
      - "subject pixel is directly adjacent to two '5' pixels, on opposite sides."
