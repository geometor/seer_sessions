The transformation seems to selectively change some '0' (white) pixels to '2' (red) pixels. The location of the changed pixels appears related to the positions of the non-zero pixels, specifically '5' (gray) pixels. The unchanged pixels seem to form a frame or boundary. The height and with of the example input and output grids match.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Specifically, check these two conditions:\n    *   Count the number of adjancent '5' pixels, adjancecy means directly above, below, left, and right, of the current pixel (not diagonal)\n    *   Are there exactly two adjacent pixels and are the adjacent '5' pixels on opposite sides of the subject pixel?\n        * \"Opposite sides\" means:\n          *   horizontal: both to the left and right.\n          *   vertical: both above and below.\n4. **If and only if** both of the above conditions are true, change the value of the '0' pixel to '2' (red) in the output grid.\n5.  **Otherwise**, copy the pixel value from the input grid to the output grid unchanged.\n\nThis program focuses on the specific adjacency rule that governs the transformation.
