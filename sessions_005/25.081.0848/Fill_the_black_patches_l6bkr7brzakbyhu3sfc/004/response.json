It replaces zeros with the first non-zero neighbor it finds. This works in some cases but fails when the zero is adjacent to multiple different colors, or should take color of diagonal neighbors. The core issue is that the code doesn't consider the *context* of the surrounding pixels sufficiently. It needs to identify connected regions of color (objects) and use that information to decide how to fill the zeros.\n\nThe strategy to improve the code involves refining how neighbors are considered: The current approach is taking only up,down,left, and right, It needs to extend this to include *all* surrounding non-zero pixels (including diagonals) when determining the fill color. If surrounding area belongs to only one group. It takes that group's color.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Example Analysis**\n\nLet's analyze each example to pinpoint exactly where the current logic fails:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n\n    "
