The input grids seem sparse, with a predominant background color (white, represented by '0') and a few isolated, single-pixel objects of different colors. The output grids appear to be constructed by positioning these colored pixels along the diagonals of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The main diagonal is a line from top left to bottom right.\n    *   Along the secondary diagonal. The secondary diagonal is a line from top right to bottom left.\n3.  **Propagate Diagonals:**\n    *   The colored pixels will form a cross pattern originating from the main diagonal position (row, col) == (0,0)\n    *   The point of the cross is defined as the (row, col) of the non white pixel.\n\n4.  **Background:** Fill all remaining cells in the output grid with white (0).\n\nIn more concise terms, for each input non-zero pixel at (r,c), create a cross in the ouput. The cross will be centered on the cell at output(r,c), extend using the color found at input(r,c).\n"
