            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information and a plan to address the discrepancies:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. The code correctly identifies non-white pixels and attempts to draw a cross, but it incorrectly fills *entire* rows and columns based on *any* non-white pixel. The expected outputs show that the cross's arms should extend only to the edges of non-white regions. Instead of expanding to the bounds of the grid, expansion must stop at the first white(0) pixel, or grid edge.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Clearly define \"non-white regions\" as contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.\n2.  **Modify Expansion Logic:** Implement a \"bounded expansion\" mechanism. The cross's arms should grow outwards from the center pixel until a white pixel (0) or the grid boundary is encountered.\n3.  **Preserve Background:** Ensure the output grid accurately mirrors background (white) pixels and fills only when a transformation is needed\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nI don't need tool execution to analyze this. The `pixels_off`, `size_correct`, `color_palette_correct` are sufficient. We can determine the input grid size, and output grid size, and find how the current algorithm operates and how the transformation should actually operate.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 5x5\n    *   Output Size: 5x5\n    *   Pixels Off: 20\n    *   Observation: Crosses extend to the edges of the grid, which is incorrect.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 5x5\n    *   Output Size: 5x5\n    *   Pixels Off: 18\n    *   Observation: Similar to Example 1, the crosses are over-extended.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Size: 5x5\n    *   Output Size: 5x5\n    *   Pixels Off: 20\n    *   Observation: Same issue - incorrect cross extension.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

If a cell is not white (value is not 0), identify its row, column, and color.\n\n3.  **Cross Generation (Bounded Expansion):** For each non-white pixel:\n    *   Set the color of current cell in the output to the color of the non-white pixel.\n    *   **Horizontal Expansion:**\n        *   Expand rightward from the center, setting pixel colors to the cross color, until a white pixel or the right grid edge is hit.\n        *   Expand leftward from the center, setting pixel colors to the cross color, until a white pixel or the left grid edge is hit.\n    *   **Vertical Expansion:**\n        *   Expand downward from the center, setting pixel colors to the cross color, until a white pixel or the bottom grid edge is hit.\n        *   Expand upward from the center, setting pixel colors to the cross color, until a white pixel or the top grid edge is hit.\n\n4.  **Output:** The output grid now contains crosses of appropriate colors, centered on the locations of the original non-white pixels, with arms extending only to the boundaries (white pixels or grid edges).\n"
