Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information and a strategy for improving the natural language program and subsequently the code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were overly simplistic. The code creates a full cross (horizontal and vertical lines spanning the entire grid) for *every* non-white pixel. The actual transformation is different: it involves creating lines that extend from the non-white pixels, but only *diagonally*. The previous code completely missed the diagonal aspect, resulting in many incorrect pixels in all test cases.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze the Errors:** We need to carefully examine where the generated output deviates from the expected output in each example. This will help pinpoint the precise nature of the diagonal expansion.
2.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** The description must clearly articulate the diagonal nature of the transformation, specifying the directions (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right) and how far the lines extend.
3.  **Metrics Gathering (with code execution):** While I already have some metrics from previous run (pixels\_off, size\_correct, color\_palette\_correct) I want to add some. Specifically the size of the input grids.
4. **Facts YAML**: Generate YAML to capture details.
5. **NLP**: Update to reflect facts.

  general:
    - input_grid_size: 5x5
    - output_grid_size: 5x5
    - transformation:  For each non-white pixel in the input, a diagonal cross of the same color is created in the output, centered on the original pixel's location.
    - diagonal_directions: up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right
    - background: white (0)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-White Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color 0).
2.  **Diagonal Cross Creation:** For each non-white pixel:
    *   Create a diagonal cross in the output grid, using the same color as the identified pixel.
    *   The center of this cross is the original location (row and column) of the non-white pixel.
    *   The cross extends diagonally in four directions:
        *   **Up-Left:**  Extend from the center pixel towards the top-left corner of the grid.
        *   **Up-Right:** Extend from the center pixel towards the top-right corner of the grid.
        *   **Down-Left:** Extend from the center pixel towards the bottom-left corner of the grid.
        *   **Down-Right:** Extend from the center pixel towards the bottom-right corner of the grid.
3. **Background**: All other pixels in the output grid not part of any diagonal cross will have the default value of 0.
