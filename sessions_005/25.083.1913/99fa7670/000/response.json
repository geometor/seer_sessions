The primary element seems to be the manipulation of non-zero colored pixels.  The zero-valued pixels (white) appear to act as a background.  The transformation doesn't seem to involve complex arithmetic or shape recognition. Instead, it appears to focus on extending existing colored pixels. The direction and extent of the expansion are key to figuring out the rule.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
