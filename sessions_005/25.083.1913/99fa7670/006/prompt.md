1. Identify Seed Pixels: Locate all pixels in the input grid with a non-zero value. These are the seed pixels.
2. Horizontal Extension: For each seed pixel, change the color of all pixels to its right, within the same row, to match the seed pixel's color. This extension continues to the right edge of the grid.
3. Vertical Extension: After the horizontal extension is complete for a seed pixel, identify the rightmost pixel of that horizontal extension.  Extend the color of *this* pixel downwards, to all pixels below it in the same column.  This continues to the bottom edge of the grid. Repeat this vertical extension for all horizontal extensions.
