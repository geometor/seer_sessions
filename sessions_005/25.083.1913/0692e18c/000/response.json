            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a small input grid into a larger output grid. The core elements seem to be:\n\n*   **Input Grid:** A 3x3 grid containing digits representing colors.\n*   **Output Grid:** A 9x9 grid, seemingly derived from the input grid.\n*   **Colors:**  The digits 0-9 represent different colors, with '0' (white) appearing as a background or empty space.  Non-zero colors are the \"active\" elements.\n*   **Pattern:** There's a clear replication and repositioning of the input grid's elements within the output grid. The input appears to be \"exploded\" or \"tiled\" in a specific way. The transformation seems to combine replication, shifting and mirroring of input grid.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
