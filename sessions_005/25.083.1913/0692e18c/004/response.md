Okay, let's analyze the provided information and formulate a revised natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were based on an interpretation of the first example. The results on the subsequent examples reveal inconsistencies and errors. The primary issue stems from an incorrect assumption about the positioning and mirroring of the input grid within the output grid. The code places mirrored copies at fixed offsets, creating many incorrect pixels, while the examples imply the output grid can be smaller, 6x6. Also, in example 3 it appears the copies are overlaid.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-evaluate the Core Transformation:** Discard the initial assumption of a fixed 9x9 output grid.
2.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully observe the placement and mirroring in *each* example, not just the first.
3.  **Identify the Correct Pattern:** Determine the *precise* relationship between the input and output grids, focusing on how the input grid is replicated and transformed, and how the dimensions of output are related to input dimensions.
4. **Refine Natural Language Program:** rewrite and simplify.

**Gather Metrics and Report:**

Let's generate a more concise comparison of input, expected, and actual.

**Natural Language Program:**

The output grid is a 9x9 grid. The input grid, along with its horizontally flipped, vertically flipped, and both horizontally and vertically flipped versions, are placed within the output grid. The original input is placed at the top-left corner. The horizontally flipped version is placed at the top-right corner. The vertically flipped version is placed at the bottom-left corner. The version flipped both horizontally and vertically is placed in the center of the output grid. The placements cause overlapping of pixels.
