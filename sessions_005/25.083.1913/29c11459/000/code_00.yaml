observations:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D arrays of digits (0-9).
  - dimensions:
      match: true
      note: Input and Output have the same dimensions
  - row_focus:
      description: Changes primarily concentrate on a single row.
  - object_identification:
      non_zero_digits:  Act as "seeds" for expansion.
      zero_digits: Represent background or empty space.
      five_digit: Acts as separator or insert.
  - actions:
    - expansion: Non-zero digits expand symmetrically.
    - insertion:  A '5' is inserted between expanded non-zero digits.
    - replacement: zero values are replaced by expansion
