            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a simplified interpretation of the first example. It correctly identified the 2x2 replication of non-zero pixels and the doubling of the grid size. However, the placement and logic of the blue \"X\" or cross are incorrect. The cross placement is dependent on the position of non zero element in input grid, it should be independent. The code also draws blue cross elements in the original 2x2 block. The code does find the first non zero element and breaks, so if multiple elements are present, it won't process that.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Decouple Cross Placement:** The blue cross should be independent of the replicated non-zero pixel's location. It should consistently span the entire output grid, regardless of where the original colored pixel is.\n2.  **Correct 2x2 Replication:** The code has issue replicating the 2x2.\n3.  **Handle Multiple Non-Zero Pixels:** The input grid might contain multiple non-zero pixels. The current code only processes the first one it encounters. We must replicate all of the non zero blocks before drawing the X.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for verification where needed):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (2, 2)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Non-zero pixel color: Red (2)\n    *    Error: The 2x2 replication has an extra blue(1) element, and cross placement is wrong.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: (10, 10)\n    *   Non-zero pixel color: Gray (5)\n    *   Error: Cross is dependent on location of the gray element, there is one missing gray 2x2.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (6, 6)\n    *   Output Shape: (12, 12)\n    *   Non-zero pixel color: Green (3)\n    *   Error: Cross is dependent on the location of green element, there is extra blue element in the 2x2 green block.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Double the Grid Size:** Create a new output grid that is twice the height and twice the width of the input grid. Initialize it with all zeros (white).\n2.  **Replicate Non-Zero Pixels:** Iterate through each cell of the *input* grid. If a cell has a non-zero value (representing a color other than white), replicate that cell as a 2x2 block in the *output* grid.  The top-left corner of the 2x2 block should be at coordinates (2\\*row, 2\\*col), where (row, col) are the coordinates of the original non-zero pixel in the input grid.\n3.  **Draw Blue Cross:** Independently of step 2, draw a blue (value 1) cross on the *output* grid. This cross consists of two diagonals: one from the top-left to the bottom-right corner, and another from the top-right to the bottom-left corner. This can be achieved by iterating through the rows of the output grid and setting the cells at (row, row) and (row, output\\_width - 1 - row) to 1.\n"
