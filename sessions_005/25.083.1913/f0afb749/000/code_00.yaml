facts:
  - observation: Input grids are smaller than output grids.
  - observation: Input grids contain a single non-zero colored pixel.
  - observation: Output grids contain an expanded 2x2 square of the input non-zero color.
  - observation: Output grids contain blue (1) pixels forming two diagonal lines, creating an 'X' or cross.
  - observation: The 2 x 2 square size seems independent to the input grid size.
  - observation: The X is aligned based on where the 2x2 colored square object ends up
  - observation: The position of non-zero pixel in input varies.
  - observation: Size of the output grid relates to the size of the input.
  - relationship: output_height = 2 * input_height
  - relationship: output_width = 2 * input_width
