The input grid seems to be replicated and repositioned within the output grid, with large areas of the output grid filled with zeros (white pixels). The positioning of input grid replica doesn't seem centered always and is not a consistent padding. It looks like some kind of combination or tiling process.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
