The input 3x3 grid is replicated and placed into a 9x9 output grid. The positions of the replicas within the output grid are determined based on examples.

Example 1: The input is placed at the top-right and bottom-left corners.
Example 2: The input is placed at the top-left, shifted down by three rows.
Example 3: The input is placed at the top-left, top-right, and bottom-left corners.

The rest of the output grid is filled with zeros.
