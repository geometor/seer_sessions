"""
The input is a 3x3 grid. The output is a 9x9 grid. The output grid contains
copies of the input grid. The rest of the output is filled with zeros.

The 3x3 input is replicated into the 9x9 output grid at the top-left,
top-right, and bottom-left. If there is a conflict (overlap), prioritize the
copies that appear later in that list (top-right overrides top-left,
bottom-left overrides both).  Example 2 appears to be an anomaly, where the
placement is at (3,0).
