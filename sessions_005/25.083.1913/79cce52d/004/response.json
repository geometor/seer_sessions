            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information and a strategy to address the discrepancies between the generated outputs and the expected outputs.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a very limited understanding, focusing only on the first training example. It incorrectly assumed the output would always be a single row (1x9) derived by concatenating selected rows from the input. The test results clearly show this is wrong, as all the expected outputs are multi-row grids, and of a different dimension (rows) to the calculated outputs. The code needs to be completely revised to correctly interpret the relationship between the input and output grids. We need to shift our focus from \"selecting rows\" to identifying a more complex transformation rule.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze all Examples:** Carefully examine all input-output pairs to discern patterns. We need to consider more than just row selection. Look at relationships between colors, positions, and potential object manipulations (rotations, reflections, etc.).\n2.  **Object Identification:** Identify potential \"objects\" within the grids (contiguous blocks of the same color). Analyze how these objects change between input and output.\n3.  **Positional Mapping:** Instead of simply concatenating, it may well be the case that input must be sampled in a specific way into output. We need to check for this type of one to one relationship by location.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Start with a simple hypothesis, generate code, test it, and refine the hypothesis based on the results.\n5. **Output size**: Determine what defines output size, it is not always the same.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis:**\n\nLet's analyze the dimensions and color palettes of each input and expected output.\n\n"
