facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids consist of single-digit integers representing colors.
  - observation: |
      The transformation is not a simple one-to-one color mapping.
  - observation: |
      There exist vertical "stripes" of single colors in inputs
  - observation: |
      The outputs seem to reorder the input stripes in reverse, but the sizes can vary, not simple copying.
  - observation: |
    The colors in output stripes can be different from any colors in the input.
  - observation: |
    Output can combine color patterns from 2 rows of the input
