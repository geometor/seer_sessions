The dimensions of the grid sometimes change and sometimes don't. It appears the transformation is not a simple global color substitution, nor merely copying parts, but a rearrangement and sometime combination based on color groupings and spatial relationships. There seems to be a complex local operation, potentially with operations across rows and columns\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
