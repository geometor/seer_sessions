Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and try to discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits, representing colors.
*   The input grids appear to be larger than the output grids.
*   There's a consistent presence of '1's forming a horizontal and vertical line surrounding other colored areas in the input grid.
*   The digits/colors in the output grid seem to be a selection of some from the input.
* There are what look like islands of values surrounded by 0 in both input and output

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: variable (e.g., 6x6, 8x8)
        elements: digits (0-9) representing colors
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: variable (smaller than input_grid)
        elements: digits (0-9) representing colors
  - type: object
    properties:
      - color_surrounded: a single color or cluster enclosed by color 1 and color 0 in the input_grid.
        selection_criteria:  colors not equal to 0 or 1 and not on the color 1 divider lines
      - output colors: colors present in the output
relationships:
  - input_grid contains multiple color areas.
  - output_grid appears to be constructed of blocks from input_grid.
actions:
  - selection: Colors are selected from the input_grid based on being surrounded by 0s and the divider of 1s.
  - extraction: color blocks on the top and bottom left of the divider lines
  - arrangement: the two extracted color blocks are placed together.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Dividers**: In the input grid, locate the horizontal and vertical lines comprised of the digit '1'.

2.  **Isolate Regions:** The intersection of the '1' lines creates four quadrants. Disregard the "inside", the middle created by the intersecting 1s.

3.  **Extract Corner objects:** Find the objects in the top left region and bottom left region bordered by 0's

4. **Construct Output**: Take the colors of those two objects and combine, placing the top left object at the top and the bottom left object at the bottom.

5.  **Output Grid**: Output the resulting grid.
