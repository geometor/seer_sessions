  - task: "Grid Transformation"
  - input_grid:
      properties:
        - contains_horizontal_divider: "A row of all '1' (blue) pixels"
        - contains_vertical_divider: "A column of all '1' (blue) pixels"
        - objects: "Connected regions of non-zero pixels, excluding divider lines"
  - dividers:
      horizontal:
          description: "Separates the grid horizontally into two regions."
          value: 1 # blue
      vertical:
          description: "Separates the grid vertically into two regions"
          value: 1 # blue

  - output_grid:
      dimensions: "Determined by number of objects and their arrangement."
      structure: "Always 2x2 in the first and third examples, but the second one has a 4x4 output"
      arrangement: |
         Top-left object in input goes to top-left in output.
         Bottom-left object in input goes to top-right in output.
         Top-right object in input goes to bottom-left in output.
         Bottom-right object in input goes to bottom-right in output.

  - transformations:
    - identify_dividers: "Find horizontal and vertical lines of '1's."
    - identify_objects: "Find connected components of the same non-zero color, excluding the dividers"
    - arrange_objects: "Place each object in the output grid based on which side of the dividers the object sits."
