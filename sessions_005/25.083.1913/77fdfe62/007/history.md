Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Find Dividers:** Locate the horizontal and vertical lines composed entirely of blue pixels (value '1') within the input grid. These act as dividers.
2.  **Identify Objects:** Divide the input grid into four regions based on the horizontal and vertical dividers: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right. Within each of these regions, identify distinct "objects." An object is a group of connected pixels of the same color, *excluding* the blue divider pixels and background (0 or white).
3.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a 2x2 output grid.
    - The object from the top-left region becomes the top-left cell of the output
    - The object from the bottom-left region becomes the top-right cell of the output.
    - The object from the top-right region becomes the bottom-left cell.
    - The object from the bottom-right region becomes the bottom-right cell.
    - When an object consists of more than a single pixel, use only the color, not the shape, and make the output object a single pixel of that color.
    - If a region does not contain a valid object, use color '0' (white).
4. Output size is variable. Example 2 has 4 x 4.

Okay, here's an analysis of the results and a plan to improve the natural language program and the code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies the core concept of blue (1) dividers and extracting colors from the four quadrants. However, it struggles with several key aspects:

1.  **Output Grid Size:** The code initially assumes a 2x2 output, then tries to adjust to 4x4, and then tries to reduce it. It's not reliably determining the correct output size based on the *input* structure and needs to make it dynamic based off examples..
2.  **Object Representation:** The code correctly extracts the *color* of the object in each quadrant but fails to handle example 2 and 3 properly - there appears to be a relationship to which quadrants are filled.
3. **Quadrant ordering:** There is an error in the order the quadrants are assigned.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Dynamic Output Grid:** Instead of hardcoding sizes, the output grid size needs to be determined dynamically. We need to analyze the *input* to determine the output shape. The presence of colors other than '1' (blue) and '0' (white) after a divider might indicate additional rows or columns.
2.  **Improved Quadrant Mapping:** Re-examine how quadrants in the input map to positions in the output. The current mapping is incorrect and not consistent across the examples. There seems to be an issue of transposing and possibly mirroring.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** The current natural language description is too vague about the relationship between input structure and output size/content. It needs to be more precise, incorporating the insights gained from analyzing *all* examples.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where helpful):**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Dividers:** Find the horizontal and vertical lines within the input grid that are composed entirely of blue pixels (value '1'). These lines act as dividers, separating the grid into four regions.

2.  **Locate Regions:** Define four regions based on the dividers:
    *   Top-Left: The region above the horizontal divider and to the left of the vertical divider.
    *   Top-Right: The region above the horizontal divider and to the right of the vertical divider.
    *   Bottom-Left: The region below the horizontal divider and to the left of the vertical divider.
    *   Bottom-Right: The region below the horizontal divider and to the right of the vertical divider.

3.  **Determine Output Grid Size**:
    *   The output grid has dimensions *M* x *N*, where:
        *   *M* is determined by number of rows in the left regions, and number of rows in the input, until the next divider, including the divider itself.
        *   *N* is determined by the number of columns in the top regions, and the number of columns, up to the next divider, including the divider itself.

4.  **Extract Object Colors:** For each of the four regions:
    *   Identify the largest "object" within the region. An object is a group of connected pixels of the same color, *excluding* blue (divider) and white (background) pixels.
    *   If a region contains a valid object, extract the *color* of that object.
    *   If a region does not contain a valid object, use the color '0' (white).

5.  **Populate Output Grid:** Create an *M* x *N* output grid. Populate the grid cells using colors based on the quadrant order and the number of cells per region:
   * Fill in all combinations of Row regions x Column Regions
   * Row Regions are Top and Bottom
   * Column Regions are Left and Right

6. Return the populated output grid.
