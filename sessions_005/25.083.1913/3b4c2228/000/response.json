            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on discerning the transformation logic and expressing it in a natural language program.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n*   **Input:** Each input is a rectangular grid of varying dimensions, containing single-digit integers (0-9) representing different colors. There are seemingly random arrangements of colored \"objects\" (contiguous blocks of the same color).\n*   **Output:** Each output is a 3x3 grid, consistently. It appears to be a simplified, abstracted representation of the input, not a direct sub-section. The output grids contain only 0s and 1s. The 1s seem to correspond to specific features in the input, though the rule isn't immediately obvious.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation doesn't involve simple cropping, mirroring, or rotation. It's a higher-level abstraction process. The consistent 3x3 output size suggests a fixed number of features or properties are being assessed.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"

Identify distinct \"objects\" formed by one or more contiguously connected pixels of the same color, ignoring the color 0.\n3. **Diagonal Mapping**:\n    *   If the input has one object of the described type above, place a 1 in the top-left corner (0, 0) of the output grid.\n    *   If there are two separate objects of the type above, place a '1' in the top-left (0,0) and the middle center(1,1) of the output grid.\n    *   If there three separate objects, place a '1' on each of the diagonal coordinates.\n4.  **Output:** Return the 3x3 output grid.\n\nIn more general terms, it appears the program identifies and maps the number of contiguous, non-zero colored regions in the input grid to a diagonal representation of 1's on the output grid. The position of the '1' values in the output corresponds to a diagonal index.\n"
