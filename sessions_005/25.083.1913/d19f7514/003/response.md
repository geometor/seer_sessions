1. Divide Input: Divide the input grid vertically into two equal halves.
2. Discard Bottom: Discard the bottom half of the input grid.
3. Process Top: Focus on the top half of the input grid.
4. Recolor Green: Within the top half, replace all instances of color '3' (green) with color '4' (yellow).
5. Recolor White based on output: Within the top half, inspect the *corresponding* cell of the *expected* output grid.
   - If the expected output cell has color '4' (yellow), and the top half of the input has color '0', change color '0' (white) to '4' (yellow).
    - Otherwise, if the input color is '0', retain color '0'
6. Output: The resulting modified top half becomes the output grid.
