These are 2D arrays of digits, where each digit corresponds to a color. In the examples given all the grids are 12 x 6 or, potentially, two 6 x 6 grids.\n*   **Output Grids:** The output grids appear to be a transformation, and visually correspond, of only the top section of the corresponding input grid. The dimensions are not always maintained.\n*   **Colors:** Predominant colors in the input are '3' (green) and '5' (gray), with '0' (white) acting as a separator or background. The output grids are entirely composed of '4' (yellow) and '0' (white).\n*  The bottom portions of input grids contain only color 5, which seems not to\n   be used to produce the output.\n* **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve replacing all instances of '3' (green) in the top half of the input grid with '4' (yellow). The bottom portion of the input grid is discarded entirely.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
