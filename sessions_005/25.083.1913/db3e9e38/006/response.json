            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the natural language program and subsequently the code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were based on a single example, and it's clear they haven't captured the full complexity of the transformation. The code correctly identifies the orange pixels (7s) and attempts to insert 8s and 7s, but the logic for *where* and *how many* to insert is flawed, as evidenced by the mismatches in both examples. The core issue is that the code does insert enough `8`s before each `7` at each level.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine *where* the transformed outputs differ from the expected outputs. Identify specific rows, columns, and values that are incorrect.\n2.  **Refine Counting/Placement Logic:** The current program seems to simply add one 8 per column, regardless if there are multiple 7 in the input row. It must consider not just the *presence* of a 7 in a row but also the number of 7 that needs to be placed in the correct level in the output row.\n3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Based on the analysis, rewrite the natural language program to accurately reflect the observed transformation rule. Be very specific about the conditions for inserting 8s and 7s.\n4. Re-implement based on the new Natural Language Program.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example 1):**\n\n*   **Input:** 7x8 grid, five rows with a '7' in the third column, two empty rows.\n*   **Expected Output:** The number of 8s decrease and the number of 7 increase at each level.\n*   **Transformed Output:** Only a single '8' followed by a single '7' is inserted in each row where a '7' was present in the input, and the rest is zeros.\n*   **Mismatch:** The transformed output fails to increase 8s in the first four rows.\n\n"
