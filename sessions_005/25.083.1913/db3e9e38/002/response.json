            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to address the errors:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were based on the first training example. The errors on subsequent examples reveal that the initial approach was too simplistic and didn't generalize well. The core issue seems to be with how rows are inserted and how the dimensions of the grid change during these insertions. The `could not broadcast input array` errors indicate a shape mismatch - likely the code is attempting to modify a region of the grid that is incompatible after earlier insert operations.\n\nThe program logic might also be flawed by assuming that a constant shift/insertion pattern is applicable. It must adapt to different input grid sizes and object positions.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is:\n\n1.  **Analyze Examples:** Carefully examine *all* provided examples (train and, if available, test). Use code execution to extract grid sizes and locations of key pixels (orange/7).\n2.  **Identify the Pattern:** The failing examples should show how the \"insert '8 7' above each '7'\" rule actually works. It's possible it involves *prepending* rows or adjusting row insertion logic.\n3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program to correctly describe the transformation rule, taking into account varying input sizes.\n4.  **Modify the Code:** Adapt the code to reflect the refined understanding, especially concerning how array resizing and insertion are handled. The existing code's structure (using `get_objects` and iterating) may be partially reusable.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using Code Execution)**\n\nI'll use `numpy` to inspect the input and output grids of the failing examples. This will give concrete data to inform the revised natural language program.\n\n"
