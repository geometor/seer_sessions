Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program was based on a single example and made several incorrect assumptions. The core issue is the placement and pairing of "8" and "7" values. The original program incorrectly prepends "8 7" pairs *within* the identified column.  The results of example 2 show the "8 7" sequences inserted *across* columns, dependent on the position of the "7" in the input. The shift operation and prepending logic are also flawed, as it appears the 8 7 combinations insert/shift *across* columns.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Object Identification:** We need to re-think what constitutes an "object." It's not just columns with orange (7), but also the *position* of the orange pixel within each row.
2.  **Analyze Inter-column Interactions:** The transformation isn't limited to single columns. The placement of '8' and '7' values depends on the row and the presence/absence of 7s in other columns of that row.
3.  **Refine Prepending/Shifting:** The current shifting is only vertical and column-specific. We need a mechanism that can insert values potentially across multiple columns.
4. **Understand the pairing logic of 8 and 7:** it looks to be alternating and dependent on how many 7's appear.
5. **Account for row insertion:** example 2 output is taller than the input, so rows can be added.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: orange_pixels
    color: orange (7)
    description: Pixels with the value 7. Their row position is crucial.
  - name: inserted_pairs
    colors: [azure (8), orange (7)]
    description: Pairs of pixels inserted, alternating 8 and 7.

actions:
  - name: find_orange_pixels
    description: Locate all pixels with the value 7 in the input grid.  Record their row and column indices.
  - name: insert_pairs
    description: Insert '8 7' pairs based on the row index of the orange pixels. The number of 8's inserted before each 7 corresponds to the final position of the 7 in the row.
  - name: shift_existing
    description: No explicit shifting. The arrangement appears constructed, not shifted.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate Orange Pixels:** Identify all orange (7) pixels in the input grid.  Record the row and column index of each.
2.  **Iterate Through Rows:** Examine each row of the *output* grid.
3.  **Construct Output Rows:** For each output row:
    *   Iterate across the potential column positions of the row.
    *   If an orange pixel exists in the original input grid in *any* column, *at that row index*, start building the output sequence for the current row by inserting an '8' for every column to the left until reaching the first 7, then a 7.
    *   For subsequent 7s found at the input row index, continue by adding 8's and a 7 to the end of the row, such as if we see n 7s in the same row, we will insert n "8"s followed by a 7.

4. **Maintain other pixels:** If no orange pixel exists in any column at the row index, keep the existing output row the same size as the input.

Key Changes and Clarifications:

*   **Row-Based Construction:** The transformation operates primarily row-wise, not column-wise. The output is constructed row by row.
*   **Horizontal Insertion:** "8 7" pairs, or series of 8s followed by a 7, are inserted *horizontally*, potentially spanning multiple columns.
*   **No Shifting:** The previous notion of "shifting" is incorrect. The output row is built based on the presence and position of orange pixels in the corresponding input row, with the '8' and '7' inserted accordingly.
*   **Multiple Oranges in a Row:** The number of "8"s prepended to the 7 increases with the number of 7s found in the row.
