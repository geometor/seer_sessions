Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves grids of digits (0-9), representing colors.
*   The primary focus seems to be on the digit '7' (orange) and its spatial relationship with other digits, potentially '0' (white) and '8'(light blue).
*   The transformation seems to involve adding, moving and replacing values.
*   It seems likely that the grid border is not crossed in the examples provided.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains a vertical line of orange (7) pixels.
  - observation: |
      The output grid contains new light blue(8) pixels.
  - observation: |
      The position and shape of 7 is related to the changes.
  - relationship: |
     The orange (7) object acts as a "seed" or starting point.
  - action: |
      Light blue(8) pixels are placed on the grid around the orange(7).
  - constraint: |
      The transformation changes from example 1 to example 2 and depends on the orange object position.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the location of all orange (7) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Iterate** from top to bottom, at each '7':
    1.  **Insert** the series "8 7" above the current '7' to the top of the grid.
    2.  **Shift** down the bottom row '7' from the bottom to match inserted lines.
    3.  **Terminate** if no more 7's
