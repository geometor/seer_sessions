The most prominent change is the introduction of the digit '1' (blue color) in the output grids, seemingly based on the position of non-'1' digits in the input and the edges of the input grid. The original digits in the input grid remain in the same place in the output grid. It appears that '1's fill a specific area defined by the input grid's boundaries and a particular \"source\" pixel.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Set to '1' until a non-'1' digit is encountered or until we have reached the original location of the non-1 digit.\n\n5. **Vertical Propogation (Downward):**\n    *   Check if the non-1 digits extend to row 0 or 1.\n     If not, set row 0 and/or 1 as 1.\n    *    From leftmost edge propagate '1's downwards until a non-'1' digit is encountered or to the bottom.\n    *    If there is a single isolated non-1 digit.\n\n6.  **Result:** The output grid now contains the transformed data, with '1's filling the designated areas.\n\nIn summary: the rule uses the position of non-1 digits to determine where to propagate the digit '1' from certain parts of the grid edges. The propagation stops when it hits other non-1 values.\n"
