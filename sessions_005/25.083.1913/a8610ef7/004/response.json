While it correctly identified the basic principle of alternating colors (red and gray) for azure pixels, it failed to generalize the rule across all rows and columns. The primary issue is the inconsistent alternation pattern and the incorrect starting color in alternating rows. The program needs to accurately capture the row-wise and count of 8 based color alternation.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Alternation Logic:** The current logic alternates colors based on even/odd rows but gets wrong result. Need to fix the starting color based on the row index and maintain a separate counter for azure (`8`) pixels *within each row*.\n2.  **Verify with all Examples:** Ensure the revised logic holds true for *all* provided training examples.\n3. **Document everything in YMAL**\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's use a simple manual analysis of the provided outputs and their differences:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Issue:** Inconsistent alternation starting colors on each row. Row 0 starts correct, row 1 incorrectly starts with Gray (5).\n*    Pixels off, Row 0: 1, Row 1: 5. Row 2: 3. ...\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Issue:** Similar to example 1, starting colors are not consistent, and the alternation within rows is incorrect in some places.\n*    Pixels off, row 1: 3. Row 2: 2. Row 3: 0. Row 5: 0\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Issue:** The alternation pattern is not consistent, especially concerning starting colors in different rows.\n*    Pixels off, row 0: 2, row 1: 1, row 3: 1, row 4: 1, row 5: 1\n\n**Example 4:**\n\n*    Issue: Same issues as above, starting colors on some rows.\n*   Pixels off, Row 0: 2. Row 1: 1. Row 3: 1. Row 4: 2. Row 5: 1\n\n**YAML Fact Representation:**\n\n"
