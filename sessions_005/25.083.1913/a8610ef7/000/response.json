The input and output grids have the same dimensions in all the provided examples. The transformation seems to consistently replace '8' (azure) with either '2' (red) or '5' (gray) while leaving '0' (white) unchanged. The choice between '2' and '5' appears to be context-dependent, suggesting a spatial or pattern-based rule, not a simple one-to-one substitution.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
