facts:
  - description: "The transformation occurs row-wise."
  - objects:
    - name: "Input Row"
      properties:
        - "Contains a sequence of non-zero colored pixels."
        - "May contain zero-valued (white) pixels."
    - name: "Output Row"
      properties:
        - "Generated by mirroring the non-zero sequence of the input row."
        - "Zero-valued pixels in the input row are replaced by mirrored values."
  - actions:
    - name: "Mirroring"
      description: "The non-zero sequence in the input row is reflected outwards from its center, filling the entire output row."
      details:
        - "The center of the sequence is determined by the start and end indices of the non-zero elements."
        - "If there is only 1 element, it becomes the center"
        - "Mirroring extends to the edges of the row, replacing all zero values."
  - constraints:
      - "The output grid dimensions are the same as the input."
      - "Only non-zero values from the input are used in the mirroring."
