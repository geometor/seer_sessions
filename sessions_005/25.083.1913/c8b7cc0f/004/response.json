            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe current code focuses on the top-leftmost non-zero pixel and its color. It attempts to build a partial outline based on directly adjacent pixels (right, down, and diagonal). This approach is too simplistic and doesn't capture the full outline or shape of the object. The results show mismatches in all three examples, indicating that the core logic needs significant improvement. The primary issue is that the code only looks for adjacent pixels in specific directions and does not trace a full outline. Also, the code makes assumptions about the shape based on only a few adjacent checks and extends the partial outline based upon this.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Improved Outline Tracing:** Instead of checking only right, down, and diagonal, we need a more robust algorithm to trace the complete outline of the object, regardless of its shape.\n2.  **Connectivity:** Prioritize finding all connected pixels of the same color as the starting pixel.\n3.  **3x3 Constraint:** Ensure the final output adheres to the 3x3 grid size.\n4. **Object Identification:** Clearly define the concept of the identified object for recreating the shape in the smaller grid.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using provided results):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: Irregular, with a '6' and a '1' section.\n    *   Expected Output: 'L' shape of '6's.\n    *   Actual Output: Only the top-left '6'.\n    *   Issue: Incomplete outline tracing.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: Two disconnected '4' shapes and a connected '1' shape.\n    *   Expected Output: Horizontal line of '4's.\n    *   Actual Output: Only the top-left '4'.\n    *   Issue: Incomplete outline and only considers the top-leftmost object.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: Irregular, with connected '3's and '1's.\n    *   Expected Output: 'L' shape of '3's.\n    *   Actual Output: Only the top-left '3'.\n    *   Issue: Incomplete outline tracing.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
