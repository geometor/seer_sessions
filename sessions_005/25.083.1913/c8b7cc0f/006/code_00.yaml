  - task: "Extract the outline of the primary object and represent it in a 3x3 grid."
  - objects:
      - name: "Primary Object"
        description: "The object defined by the connected component of pixels with the same color, identified by the top-leftmost non-zero pixel."
        properties:
          - color: "Determined dynamically based on the top-leftmost non-zero pixel."
          - outline: "The set of pixels belonging to the object that are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a pixel of a different color (including the background)."
      - name: "Output Grid"
        description: "A 3x3 grid to represent the extracted outline."
        properties:
          - size: "3x3"
          - fill: "Initially filled with black (0)."
  - actions:
      - name: "Identify Primary Object"
        description: "Locate the top-leftmost non-zero pixel in the input grid and determine its color."
      - name: "Trace Outline"
        description: "Accurately trace the outline of the primary object. Prioritize top and left parts."
      - name: "Render Outline"
        description: "Fill the 3x3 output grid with the primary object's color, representing only its outline and normalized to the top-left of the outline. If there is an outline at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) and (1,0) on the input, the output should include the outline color at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) and (1,0) respectively."
