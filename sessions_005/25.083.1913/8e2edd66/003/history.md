Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a pattern observed in the first example, but it doesn't generalize well to the other examples. The core issue is that the placement of the non-zero color in the output grid is more dynamic and dependent on the input grid than initially assumed. It seems like it's creating some kind of "mirrored" or reflected pattern, but the exact logic of which is not yet captured. The code assumes fixed row, col positions, when, in actuality, the output pixel positions depend on the input pixels.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Pixel Relationships:** Instead of hardcoding positions, we need to find the relationship between the *input* pixel positions and the *output* pixel positions.
2.  **Consider Symmetry/Reflection:** The expected outputs suggest some form of symmetry or reflection around a central axis, possibly both horizontal and vertical.
3.  **Re-evaluate Assumptions:** My initial code assumes the output grids were always 9x9. Let's verify that with code execution first.

**Gather Metrics & Verify Assumptions:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the non-zero color:** Find the single color (other than 0/white) present in the input grid.
2.  **Expand the grid:** Create a 9x9 output grid filled with zeros.
3.  **Map and Mirror Input to Output:**
    *   The output grid's colored pixels appear to be a mapping, with both horizontal and vertical reflection of the input grid's non-zero pixels. The input grid is effectively being "blown up" and mirrored onto the larger output grid. The precise mapping logic is not simple, but the pattern of pixel positions in each output grid is consistently based on the input.
    *   The output pixel locations can be found using the locations of the input pixels
    *   The output pixels are always on one of the axes or diagonal of the output grid.

This description acknowledges the complexity of the transformation and highlights the key aspects: finding the color, expanding to 9x9, and a complex mirroring/mapping operation. The "complex mirroring" part is where further analysis, possibly with more examples, would be needed to fully formalize the rule.
