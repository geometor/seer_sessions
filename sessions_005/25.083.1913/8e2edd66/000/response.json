            "text": "Okay, I'm ready to analyze these input-output examples and try to understand the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** The input is a small 3x3 grid. The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. There is always a rectangular object of a single color in the top left 2x2 corner.\n*   **Output:** The output is a larger 9x9 grid. The output grid seems to be related to the input grid, with the input non-zero color placed in a seemingly complex way on the output grid. The rest is filled with zeros.\n*  **Transformation:** It looks the output is an expansion of the input, some form of patterned replication, placement or tiling. There is an underlying geometric or spatial rule that dictates how the colors of the input grid are spread out and arranged in the output grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the non-zero color:** Find the single color present other than zeros on the input grid, for the examples it will be in the top left 2x2 section. Let this color be `C`.\n\n2.  **Create the output grid:** Create a new empty 9x9 grid filled with 0.\n\n3.  **Apply the transformation rule:**\n  *   Iterate over every cell of the output grid with the coordinates (row, col).\n  * Check these conditions for each position, if match assign value C:\n    * The row index is equal to 8, and col index is equal to 0,2,6,8\n    * The row index is equal to 7 and col index is equal to 0,6\n    * The row index is equal to 6, and col index is equal to 0,2,6,8\n    * The row index is equal to 5 and col index is equal to 0\n    * The row index is equal to 4 and col index is equal to 0\n    * The row index is equal to 3 and col index is equal to 0\n    * The row index is equal to 2, and col index is equal to 2,4,6\n    * The row index is equal to 1 and col index is equal to 6,7\n    * The row index is equal to 0 and col index is equal to 6\n\n4. **Return Result:** output grid\n\nIn summary, the transformation takes the non-zero color from the input grid and places it in specific locations within a larger, initially empty 9x9 output grid, following a complex pattern. All other locations are 0.\n"
