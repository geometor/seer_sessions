            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of expanding and mirroring the non-zero pixels into a 9x9 grid was partially correct. However, the mirroring logic is flawed and doesn't accurately capture the relationship between the input and output grids across all examples. The code correctly identifies the non-zero color and attempts to position pixels in the output, but the mirroring is inconsistent with the provided examples. The core issue lies in misinterpreting the spatial transformation and how the input grid maps to the output grid. It appears some form of \"corner expansion\" and possible \"center pixel influence\", with different ways of handling edge and center cases.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1. **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze each input/output pair, paying close attention to the position of the non-zero pixels in the input and their corresponding positions in the output. I need to determine how position changes, and if/how mirroring occurs.\n2. **Identify the Correct Mapping:** Determine the precise mathematical/geometric relationship between the input and output pixel coordinates. I will look for patterns and relationships in the examples.\n3. **Refine Mirroring/Expansion Logic:** Adjust the mirroring and expansion logic in the `transform` function to align with the observed pattern. It may not simply be horizontal and vertical mirroring.\n4. **Consider Edge Cases:** The transformation might behave differently for pixels on the edges or in the center of the input grid.\n5. **Test Extensively:** After modifying the code, test it thoroughly with all provided examples and potentially new, fabricated examples to ensure the transformation rule is consistent.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nI will calculate the coordinate translations for each example to reveal the underlying pattern.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\nInput:\n"
