Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** The input is a small 2D grid (3x3) of single-digit integers, each representing a color.\n*   **Output:** The output is a larger 2D grid (9x9) that seems to be composed of multiple copies of the input grid, along with some areas filled with zeros (white color). The input grid appears in multiple locations in the ouput grid.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a replication and arrangement of the input grid within a larger canvas. The specific arrangement seems to include original grid, padding with zeros, and concatenating.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
