            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example and doesn't generalize well to the other examples. The core idea of replicating the input grid horizontally and vertically is partially correct, but the placement and overlap logic are flawed. The code seems to misunderstand where the replications should be placed within the 9x9 output grid, and it doesn't handle the \"empty space\" (zeros) correctly. The primary issue is the fixed offsets and overlaps in code. The output grid will often be incorrect unless the input is a specific dimension.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Placement Logic:** Instead of hardcoded indices, the placement of the replicated grids should be relative to the input grid's dimensions and account for centering. The results show the code is inserting where it should not\n2.  **Understand \"Empty Space\":** The examples suggest that the replicated patterns might be centered, leaving zeros where the patterns don't reach. Need to find the pattern in where the blank spaces appear.\n3.  **Clarify Overlap Rule:** Review how the code handle placement - is it correct that the Vertical grid always wins? It appears there may be a misinterpretation here, and the code overwrites where it should not.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where necessary):**\n\n"
