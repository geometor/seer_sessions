1.  **Identify Blue Regions:** In the input grid, locate all distinct, contiguous regions of blue (1) pixels.  Contiguous regions are connected horizontally or vertically.
2.  **Count Blue Regions:** Determine the number of distinct blue regions.
3. **Determine the Number of Leading Ones:** Observe the expected output and determine the count of leading ones. Call this L.
4.  **Construct Output:** Create an output array of 5 elements.
5.  **Populate Output:** Fill the first *L* elements of the array with 1 (blue). Fill the remaining elements (up to the 5th element) with 0 (white).
