The output length is consistent (5 elements) across all three training examples.\n*    The values present in the outputs are also present in the inputs.\n*   **Transformation:** The core challenge is to determine how the input grid is reduced to the output array. It's not a simple sub-region extraction, color filtering, or mirroring. It is likely some form of object detection and property extraction.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"
