facts:
  - role: environment
    content: The task operates on grids of colored pixels.
  - role: input_grid
    property: background_color
    value: Azure 8
  - role: input_grid
    property: contains
    value: one or more "boundary" pixels with colors other than Azure 8.
  - role: boundary_pixels
    description: Pixels in the input grid that are not Azure 8.
    property: forms_shape
    value: These pixels often define the outline of one or more shapes.
  - role: output_grid
    property: preserves
    value: The original boundary pixels from the input grid.
  - role: output_grid
    property: contains
    value: "filled" pixels colored Red 2.
  - role: filled_pixels
    description: Pixels that are Red 2 in the output.
    property: original_color
    value: These pixels were Azure 8 in the corresponding input grid.
    property: location
    value: Located "inside" the area defined by the boundary pixels.
  - role: action
    name: fill_interior
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    condition: The boundary pixels must form a closed or enclosing shape. If they form an open shape, line, or isolated points, no filling occurs.
    target_pixels: Azure 8 pixels located within the enclosed area.
    change: Change target_pixels color to Red 2.
  - role: hypothesis
    source: previous_code
    content: The "inside" area corresponds to the convex hull of the boundary pixels.
    status: unverified (due to execution error), potentially needs refinement based on non-convex examples.
  - role: dependency_issue
    library: scipy.spatial.ConvexHull
    error: ModuleNotFoundError
    impact: Prevented verification of the convex hull hypothesis via code execution.
  - role: dependency_issue
    library: matplotlib.path.Path
    error: Likely ModuleNotFoundError if scipy is missing (often installed together or used sequentially).
    impact: Prevented verification of point-in-polygon test via code execution.
