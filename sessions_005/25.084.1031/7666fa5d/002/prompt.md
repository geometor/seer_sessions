Identify non-background pixels (boundary pixels). Compute the convex hull polygon

If a pixel's coordinates fall inside or on the boundary of the convex hull polygon 
AND its original color in the input grid was the background color (Azure 8), 
change its color in the output grid to Red (2). All original non-background
