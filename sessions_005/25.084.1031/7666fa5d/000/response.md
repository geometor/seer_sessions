Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Size:** Both input and output grids in the examples are 16x16.
2.  **Background Color:** The predominant color in both input and output grids is Azure (8), acting as the background.
3.  **Input Features:** The input grids contain scattered single pixels of a non-background color. In `train_1`, these are Yellow (4) pixels. In `train_2`, these are Green (3) pixels. These non-background pixels appear to define the vertices of shapes.
4.  **Output Features:** The output grids retain the original non-background pixels (Yellow or Green) from the input in their exact locations. Additionally, new Red (2) pixels appear in the output.
5.  **Transformation:** The Red (2) pixels fill the areas enclosed by the original non-background pixels. Visually, it looks like the transformation identifies the set of non-background pixels, computes the convex hull encompassing these pixels, and then fills the interior of this hull (including points on the edges but excluding the original vertex pixels) with Red (2). The original non-background pixels act as the boundary or vertices of the filled region. The specific color of the boundary pixels (Yellow or Green) doesn't seem to affect the fill color (always Red) or the process itself.

## Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_size_input: [16, 16]
  grid_size_output: [16, 16]
  background_color: 8 # Azure
  fill_color: 2 # Red

examples:
  train_1:
    input_features:
      - object_type: scattered_pixels
        color: 4 # Yellow
        role: boundary_vertices
    output_features:
      - object_type: scattered_pixels # Preserved from input
        color: 4 # Yellow
        role: boundary_vertices
      - object_type: filled_region
        color: 2 # Red
        role: interior_fill
    relationship: The Red region fills the convex hull defined by the Yellow pixels, excluding the Yellow pixels themselves.
  train_2:
    input_features:
      - object_type: scattered_pixels
        color: 3 # Green
        role: boundary_vertices
    output_features:
      - object_type: scattered_pixels # Preserved from input
        color: 3 # Green
        role: boundary_vertices
      - object_type: filled_region
        color: 2 # Red
        role: interior_fill
    relationship: The Red region fills the convex hull defined by the Green pixels, excluding the Green pixels themselves.

general_transformation:
  - action: identify_pixels
    condition: color is not the background color (Azure 8)
    target: boundary_pixels
  - action: compute_geometry
    type: convex_hull
    input: locations of boundary_pixels
    output: convex_hull_polygon
  - action: create_output_grid
    source: copy of input_grid
  - action: iterate_pixels
    target: all pixels (r, c) in the grid
  - action: check_condition
    condition_1: pixel (r, c) is inside or on the boundary of the convex_hull_polygon
    condition_2: input_grid[r, c] is the background_color (Azure 8)
  - action: modify_pixel (if conditions met)
    target: output_grid[r, c]
    new_color: fill_color (Red 2)
  - action: preserve_pixels
    target: boundary_pixels
    effect: ensure original non-background pixels remain unchanged in the output grid (handled by condition_2 in modify_pixel step).

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not the background color (Azure 8). Let these be the 'boundary pixels'. Record their coordinates.
3.  If no boundary pixels are found, return the copied input grid as the output.
4.  If boundary pixels exist, compute the convex hull polygon defined by the coordinates of these boundary pixels.
5.  Iterate through each pixel location (row `r`, column `c`) within the grid.
6.  For each pixel location (r, c):
    a.  Check if the point (r, c) lies inside or on the boundary of the computed convex hull polygon.
    b.  Check if the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the *original input grid* is the background color (Azure 8).
    c.  If both conditions (a and b) are true, change the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the *output grid* to Red (2).
7.  Return the modified output grid.
