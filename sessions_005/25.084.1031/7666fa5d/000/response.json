In `train_1`, these are Yellow (4) pixels. In `train_2`, these are Green (3) pixels. These non-background pixels appear to define the vertices of shapes.\n4.  **Output Features:** The output grids retain the original non-background pixels (Yellow or Green) from the input in their exact locations. Additionally, new Red (2) pixels appear in the output.\n5.  **Transformation:** The Red (2) pixels fill the areas enclosed by the original non-background pixels. Visually, it looks like the transformation identifies the set of non-background pixels, computes the convex hull encompassing these pixels, and then fills the interior of this hull (including points on the edges but excluding the original vertex pixels) with Red (2). The original non-background pixels act as the boundary or vertices of the filled region. The specific color of the boundary pixels (Yellow or Green) doesn't seem to affect the fill color (always Red) or the process itself.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
