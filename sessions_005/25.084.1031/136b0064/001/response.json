Create a new output grid with the same number of rows as the input grid and a width equal to `yellow_col`, filled initially with white pixels (color 0).\n3. Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid where the column index `c` is less than `yellow_col`.\n4. If the input cell `input_grid[r, c]` is not white, copy its color to the output grid at position `output[r, c + 1]`, but only if `c + 1` is less than `yellow_col`.\n5. Search the region of the input grid to the right of the yellow line (where column index `c` is greater than `yellow_col`). Scan this region row by row from top to bottom, and within each row, scan column by column from left to right.\n6. Find the coordinates `(r_special, c_special)` and color of the *first* non-white pixel encountered in this right-side region.\n7. If such a special pixel is found, place its color into the output grid at the calculated position `output[r_special, c_special - yellow_col - 1]`.\n8.
