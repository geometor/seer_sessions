1. Identify the column index (`yellow_col`) of the vertical yellow line (color 4) in the input grid.
2. Create a new output grid with the same number of rows as the input grid and a width equal to `yellow_col`, filled initially with white pixels (color 0).
3. Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid where the column index `c` is less than `yellow_col`.
4. If the input cell `input_grid[r, c]` is not white, copy its color to the output grid at position `output[r, c + 1]`, but only if `c + 1` is less than `yellow_col`.
5. Search the region of the input grid to the right of the yellow line (where column index `c` is greater than `yellow_col`). Scan this region row by row from top to bottom, and within each row, scan column by column from left to right.
6. Find the coordinates `(r_special, c_special)` and color of the *first* non-white pixel encountered in this right-side region.
7. If such a special pixel is found, place its color into the output grid at the calculated position `output[r_special, c_special - yellow_col - 1]`.
8. The resulting grid is the final output.
