This line acts as a separator.\n    *   The output grids are smaller than the input grids, specifically in width. The height remains the same.\n    *   The output grid's content appears derived primarily from the objects located to the *left* of the yellow line in the input. These objects seem shifted one position to the right in the output.\n    *   Additionally, one specific pixel from the *right* side of the yellow line in the input appears in the output, but its position is determined by a different rule related to its distance from the yellow line.\n    *   The yellow line itself is not present in the output.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
