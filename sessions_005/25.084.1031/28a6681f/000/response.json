Iterate through each pixel in the input grid, excluding pixels in the first and last columns (as they cannot be the center of a horizontal triplet). Let the current pixel's coordinates be (row, col).\n3.  Check if the color of the current pixel at (row, col) is white (0).\n4.  If it is white, check the colors of its immediate left neighbor at (row, col-1) and immediate right neighbor at (row, col+1).\n5.  If both the left neighbor and the right neighbor are non-white (color 1-9) AND they have the exact same color value, then change the color of the pixel at (row, col) in the *output* grid to blue (1).\n6.  If the conditions in steps 3 or 5 are not met, the pixel at (row, col) in the output grid retains its original color from the input grid.\n7.  After checking all applicable pixels, the modified grid is the final output."
