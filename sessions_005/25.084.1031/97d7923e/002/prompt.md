"""
Identifies all vertical, contiguous blocks of a single color (non-white) that have a pixel of a different non-white color directly above them (a 'trigger' pixel). Among these candidate blocks, it selects the one with the greatest height. If there's a tie in height, it selects the leftmost one (smallest column index). Finally, it recolors all pixels within the selected block to match the color of its corresponding trigger pixel. If no such candidate blocks are found, the grid remains unchanged.
