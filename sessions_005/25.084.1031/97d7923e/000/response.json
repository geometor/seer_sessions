The grid dimensions remain unchanged. The background is predominantly white (0).\n2.  **Key Colors:** Non-white colors form shapes, often vertical columns or segments within columns. The colors involved in the transformation vary between examples (red, gray, green, blue, orange).\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes consistently occur within specific vertical columns. A block of pixels of one color within a column is changed to another color.\n4.  **Trigger Mechanism:** The change seems initiated by a \"trigger\" pixel located directly above the block that gets modified. This trigger pixel has a different color than the block it triggers.\n5.  **Selection Criteria:** Not all potential trigger/block pairs result in a change. Comparing the examples, the transformation applies only to the column containing the *tallest* vertical block that has a valid trigger pixel directly above it. If multiple columns have blocks of the same maximum height satisfying the trigger condition, the examples suggest the leftmost one is chosen (though Train_1 and Train_2 only had one candidate after height selection, Train_3 confirms the leftmost selection among multiple candidates if height wasn't the primary factor, but height *is* the primary factor here).\n6.  **Change Action:** Once the target column and block are identified, all pixels within that specific vertical block (starting from the pixel just below the trigger) are changed to the color of the trigger pixel.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Iterate through each column of the input grid from left to right (index `c`).\n3.  Within each column, iterate through the rows from top to bottom (index `r`), stopping one row before the bottom.\n4.  At each position `(r, c)`, check if the pixel at `(r, c)` (the potential 'trigger') is non-white and the pixel directly below it at `(r+1, c)` (the potential 'block start') is also non-white, AND if their colors are different.\n5.  If these conditions are met, identify the full vertical extent of the contiguous block of the *same color* as the pixel at `(r+1, c)`, starting from `(r+1, c)` downwards. Let this block's color be `block_color`, its height be `block_height`, its starting row be `r+1`, and its ending row be `end_row`. Let the trigger pixel's color be `trigger_color`.\n6.  Store the details of this candidate: `(column_index=c, start_row=r+1, end_row=end_row, height=block_height, trigger_color=trigger_color)`.\n7.  After checking all columns and rows, examine the list of candidates found.\n8.  If no candidates were found, the transformation is complete, and the output is the same as the input.\n9.  If candidates were found, find the candidate(s) with the maximum `block_height`.\n10. If there is only one candidate with the maximum height, select it.\n11. If there are multiple candidates with the same maximum height, select the one with the smallest `column_index` (the leftmost one).\n12. Take the selected candidate's details (`column_index`, `start_row`, `end_row`, `trigger_color`).\n13. Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n14. Modify the output grid: For each row `i` from `start_row` to `end_row`, change the color of the pixel at `(i, column_index)` to `trigger_color`.\n15. Return the modified output grid."
