task_description: Recolor the tallest vertical block based on the color of the pixel directly above it.

definitions:
  - object: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
  - object: Vertical Block
    properties:
      - color: (1-9) # Non-white
      - column_index: integer
      - start_row: integer
      - end_row: integer
      - height: integer (end_row - start_row + 1)
  - object: Trigger Pixel
    properties:
      - color: (1-9) # Non-white
      - position: (row, column)

relationships:
  - type: Vertical Adjacency
    description: A Trigger Pixel at (r, c) is directly above a Vertical Block starting at (r+1, c).
  - type: Color Difference
    description: The color of the Trigger Pixel is different from the color of the Vertical Block it is above.

actions:
  - name: Identify Candidate Blocks
    description: Find all Vertical Blocks where a Trigger Pixel of a different color exists directly above the block's topmost pixel.
  - name: Measure Height
    description: Calculate the height of each Candidate Block.
  - name: Select Target Block
    description: >
      Choose the Candidate Block with the maximum height.
      If there is a tie in height, choose the Candidate Block located in the leftmost column (smallest column_index).
  - name: Recolor Block
    description: Change the color of all pixels within the selected Target Block to the color of its corresponding Trigger Pixel.

input_output_relationship:
  - The output grid is identical to the input grid, except for the pixels within the selected Target Block, which are recolored according to the Recolor Block action.
  - If no Candidate Blocks are found, the output grid is identical to the input grid.
