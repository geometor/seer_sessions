The goal is to generate a 1D list (represented as a column) based on these objects. The key steps seem to be: identifying the background color, finding all other distinct colored objects, determining the size (pixel count) of each object, ordering these objects based on their vertical position (topmost first), and finally creating the output list by repeating the color of each object according to its size, following the determined order.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Identify all contiguous objects in the input grid that are *not* the background color.\n    3.  For each identified object, record its color, its total number of pixels (pixel count), and the row index of its topmost pixel.\n    4.  Sort these objects based on their topmost row index in ascending order (from top to bottom). If two objects share the same topmost row, sort them by their leftmost column index in ascending order (left to right - *this is an assumption based on typical grid processing, not strictly required by the examples shown*).\n    5.
