"""
1. Determine the background color by finding the most frequent color in the input grid.
2. Identify all contiguous objects composed of colors other than the background color.
3. For each object, determine its color, the number of pixels it contains (pixel count), and the row index of its topmost pixel (and leftmost column for tie-breaking).
4. Sort these objects first by their topmost row index (ascending) and then by their leftmost column index (ascending).
5. Construct a 1D list by iterating through the sorted objects and appending each object's color to the list a number of times equal to its pixel count.
6. Reshape this 1D list into an Nx1 grid (a single column) for the final output.
