Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Input Grid Composition**: The input grids contain various shapes formed by contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color on a white (0) background.
2.  **Key Objects**: A recurring pattern is a 3x3 square object. This object consists of an 8-pixel frame of one color (`F`) and a single center pixel of a different color (`C`). Both `F` and `C` are non-background colors. I'll refer to these as "target objects".
3.  **Other Objects**: Other shapes exist, notably shapes made entirely of Gray (5) pixels. There are also other simple rectangular shapes (e.g., Example 1 has a 3x1 Yellow/Red shape).
4.  **Output Grid Composition**: The output grids seem to be constructed selectively from the input grid elements.
5.  **Transformation Observation**:
    *   Some "target objects" from the input are preserved in the output, but their center pixel's color is changed according to a specific rule dependent on the original frame and center colors.
    *   Other "target objects" from the input are completely absent in the output (replaced by the background color 0).
    *   All Gray (5) pixels from the input appear to be preserved in their original positions in the output.
    *   Other shapes/pixels (that are not Gray and not part of a preserved target object) are removed in the output.
6.  **Rule Identification**: The core logic seems to involve identifying the 3x3 target objects, checking if their (Frame Color, Center Color) pair matches a specific set of predefined transformation rules. If a match occurs, the object is kept, but its center color is updated based on the rule. If no match occurs for a target object, it is discarded. All Gray pixels are always kept. All other pixels are discarded.

  grid_properties:
    - size: Variable (up to 30x30)
    - colors: 0-9 palette used. 0 is background (white), 5 is gray.

  - action: define_transformation_map
    description: "A fixed mapping determining if a target object is kept and how its center color changes."
    map:
      (3, 4): 2  # Green frame, Yellow center -> Red center
      (6, 1): 3  # Magenta frame, Blue center -> Green center
      (1, 4): 8  # Blue frame, Yellow center -> Azure center
      (8, 3): 2  # Azure frame, Green center -> Red center
      (1, 2): 9  # Blue frame, Red center -> Maroon center
      (7, 4): 3  # Orange frame, Yellow center -> Green center
  - action: build_output_grid
    steps:
      - Initialize output_grid with background color (0).
      - For each identified target_object:
          - If its (frame_color, center_color) pair is in the transformation_map:
              - Get the new_center_color from the map.
              - Copy the 8 frame pixels (with frame_color) from the input to the output_grid at the target_object's location.
              - Set the center pixel in the output_grid to new_center_color.
      - For each identified gray_pixel location:
          - Set the corresponding pixel in the output_grid to Gray (5).
    output: final output_grid

relationships:
  - preservation: Gray pixels are always preserved from input to output.
  - conditional_preservation: Target objects are preserved (with modification) only if their (Frame, Center) color pair matches the transformation map.
  - removal: Target objects not matching the map are removed.
  - removal: All other non-background, non-gray pixels are removed.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new empty grid (filled with the background color 0) of the same dimensions as the input grid. This will be the output grid.
2.  Define a specific set of "transformation rules" as pairs of (Input Frame Color, Input Center Color) mapped to a New Center Color:
    *   (Green=3, Yellow=4) maps to Red=2
    *   (Magenta=6, Blue=1) maps to Green=3
    *   (Blue=1, Yellow=4) maps to Azure=8
    *   (Azure=8, Green=3) maps to Red=2
    *   (Blue=1, Red=2) maps to Maroon=9
    *   (Orange=7, Yellow=4) maps to Green=3
3.  Search the input grid for all instances of "target objects", defined as 3x3 squares where the 8 border cells have a uniform color (Frame Color, F) and the center cell has a different uniform color (Center Color, C), and neither F nor C is the background color (0). Record the Frame Color, Center Color, and the top-left location `(r, c)` for each found target object.
4.  For each target object found in the input grid:
    a.  Check if its (Frame Color, Center Color) pair exists as a key in the transformation rules defined in Step 2.
    b.  If the pair exists:
        i.  Retrieve the corresponding New Center Color from the rules.
        ii. Copy the 8 frame pixels (using the original Frame Color F) from the input grid's 3x3 area to the corresponding 3x3 area in the output grid (at location `(r, c)`).
        iii. Set the center pixel `(r+1, c+1)` in the output grid to the New Center Color.
5.  Iterate through every pixel `(i, j)` of the input grid.
6.  If the pixel `input[i, j]` has the color Gray (5):
    a.  Set the corresponding pixel `output[i, j]` in the output grid to Gray (5).
7.  The final output grid, containing the transformed target objects and the preserved gray pixels on a background of 0, is the result.
