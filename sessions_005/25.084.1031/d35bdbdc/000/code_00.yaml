task_context:
  description: "Transforms input grid based on rules applied to specific 3x3 patterns and preserves gray elements."
  grid_properties:
    - size: Variable (up to 30x30)
    - colors: 0-9 palette used. 0 is background (white), 5 is gray.

identified_objects:
  - object_type: target_object
    definition: "A 3x3 area where the 8 border pixels are of a uniform non-background color (F) and the center pixel is of a different uniform non-background color (C)."
    properties:
      - frame_color: F
      - center_color: C
      - location: top-left corner coordinates (r, c)
  - object_type: gray_pixel
    definition: "Any pixel with color value 5 (Gray)."
    properties:
      - color: 5
      - location: coordinates (r, c)
  - object_type: background_pixel
    definition: "Any pixel with color value 0 (White)."

transformations:
  - action: identify_target_objects
    input: input_grid
    output: list of target_objects with their F, C, and location.
  - action: identify_gray_pixels
    input: input_grid
    output: list of gray_pixel locations.
  - action: define_transformation_map
    description: "A fixed mapping determining if a target object is kept and how its center color changes."
    map:
      (3, 4): 2  # Green frame, Yellow center -> Red center
      (6, 1): 3  # Magenta frame, Blue center -> Green center
      (1, 4): 8  # Blue frame, Yellow center -> Azure center
      (8, 3): 2  # Azure frame, Green center -> Red center
      (1, 2): 9  # Blue frame, Red center -> Maroon center
      (7, 4): 3  # Orange frame, Yellow center -> Green center
  - action: build_output_grid
    steps:
      - Initialize output_grid with background color (0).
      - For each identified target_object:
          - If its (frame_color, center_color) pair is in the transformation_map:
              - Get the new_center_color from the map.
              - Copy the 8 frame pixels (with frame_color) from the input to the output_grid at the target_object's location.
              - Set the center pixel in the output_grid to new_center_color.
      - For each identified gray_pixel location:
          - Set the corresponding pixel in the output_grid to Gray (5).
    output: final output_grid

relationships:
  - preservation: Gray pixels are always preserved from input to output.
  - conditional_preservation: Target objects are preserved (with modification) only if their (Frame, Center) color pair matches the transformation map.
  - removal: Target objects not matching the map are removed.
  - removal: All other non-background, non-gray pixels are removed.
