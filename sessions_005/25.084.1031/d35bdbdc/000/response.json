            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Input Grid Composition**: The input grids contain various shapes formed by contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color on a white (0) background.\n2.  **Key Objects**: A recurring pattern is a 3x3 square object. This object consists of an 8-pixel frame of one color (`F`) and a single center pixel of a different color (`C`). Both `F` and `C` are non-background colors. I'll refer to these as \"target objects\".\n3.  **Other Objects**: Other shapes exist, notably shapes made entirely of Gray (5) pixels. There are also other simple rectangular shapes (e.g., Example 1 has a 3x1 Yellow/Red shape).\n4.  **Output Grid Composition**: The output grids seem to be constructed selectively from the input grid elements.\n5.  **Transformation Observation**:\n    *   Some \"target objects\" from the input are preserved in the output, but their center pixel's color is changed according to a specific rule dependent on the original frame and center colors.\n    *   Other \"target objects\" from the input are completely absent in the output (replaced by the background color 0).\n    *   All Gray (5) pixels from the input appear to be preserved in their original positions in the output.\n    *   Other shapes/pixels (that are not Gray and not part of a preserved target object) are removed in the output.\n6.  **Rule Identification**: The core logic seems to involve identifying the 3x3 target objects, checking if their (Frame Color, Center Color) pair matches a specific set of predefined transformation rules. If a match occurs, the object is kept, but its center color is updated based on the rule. If no match occurs for a target object, it is discarded. All Gray pixels are always kept. All other pixels are discarded.\n\n## YAML Facts Documentation\n\n"

Record the Frame Color, Center Color, and the top-left location `(r, c)` for each found target object.\n4.  For each target object found in the input grid:\n    a.  Check if its (Frame Color, Center Color) pair exists as a key in the transformation rules defined in Step 2.\n    b.  If the pair exists:\n        i.
