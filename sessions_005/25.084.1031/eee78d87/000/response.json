            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n## Perception of Task Elements\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** The input is always a 6x6 grid. It predominantly consists of an orange (7) background. In each example, there's a small, contiguous shape made of a different color (green=3, blue=1, or magenta=6). The shape's specific color and exact position vary between examples.\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output is always a larger 16x16 grid. It has a structured pattern based on the input.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:**\n    *   The output grid size (16x16) relates to the input size (6x6) by the formula `(Input_Dim * 3 - 2)`. (6 * 3 - 2 = 16).\n    *   The output grid seems to be constructed by mapping each input pixel to a 3x3 region in the output, with overlaps creating the final structure.\n    *   Specifically, each orange (7) pixel in the input corresponds to a 2x2 block of orange `[[7, 7], [7, 7]]` placed in the output grid. The top-left corner of this 2x2 block is at `(row * 3, col * 3)`, where `(row, col)` are the coordinates in the input grid.\n    *   The spaces between these 2x2 orange blocks are filled with white (0), creating a grid-like pattern.\n    *   Crucially, if the input grid contains *any* pixel that is *not* orange (i.e., if the colored shape is present), a fixed 6x6 block of maroon (9) is placed in the center of the output grid. This maroon block covers rows 5 through 10 and columns 5 through 10 (inclusive), overwriting any orange or white pixels that were previously placed there.\n    *   The specific color or position of the non-orange shape in the input does not affect the *content* or *position* of the maroon block in the output; its mere *presence* triggers the maroon block overlay.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"
