## General Assessment

The previous code correctly identified the output grid size calculation (`Input_Dim * 3 - 2`) and the conditional application of a central maroon (9) overlay based on the presence of non-background pixels in the input. However, it incorrectly handled the mapping of input pixels to the output grid.

Specifically, the previous code assumed:
1.  Only background (orange, 7) input pixels contribute directly to the output grid (by creating 2x2 orange blocks).
2.  Non-background input pixels only served to trigger the overlay, without affecting the base pattern of the output grid.

The comparison between `Expected Output` and `Transformed Output` reveals that this is incorrect. The `Expected Output` shows a consistent structure where *each* input pixel corresponds to a 2x2 area in the output grid, separated by single-pixel white lines. The color of the 2x2 output block depends on the color of the corresponding input pixel:
*   If the input pixel is orange (7), the output 2x2 block is orange (7).
*   If the input pixel is *not* orange (7), the output 2x2 block is white (0).

The central maroon (9) overlay is then applied *on top* of this base grid if, and only if, the input grid contained at least one non-orange pixel.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  Modify the grid generation logic to create the base output grid (size `H*3-2`, `W*3-2`) initialized to white (0).
2.  Iterate through the input grid. For each pixel `input_grid[r, c]`:
    *   Determine the top-left corner `(out_r, out_c)` = `(r * 3, c * 3)` in the output grid.
    *   If `input_grid[r, c]` is orange (7), fill the 2x2 block `output_grid[out_r:out_r+2, out_c:out_c+2]` with orange (7).
    *   If `input_grid[r, c]` is *not* orange (7), fill the 2x2 block `output_grid[out_r:out_r+2, out_c:out_c+2]` with white (0). Note: Since the grid is initialized to white, this step might seem redundant, but explicitly defining it clarifies the mapping rule. Alternatively, only draw the orange blocks.
3.  Keep track if any non-orange pixel was encountered during the iteration.
4.  After iterating through all input pixels, if a non-orange pixel was detected, apply the 6x6 maroon (9) overlay to the center of the output grid (rows 5-10, columns 5-10).

## Metrics Gathering

Let's analyze the grids more formally. We'll focus on Example 2, as it clearly shows both orange and non-orange mappings.

Input (Example 2): 6x6

```

 [7 7 7 7 7 7]]
```
