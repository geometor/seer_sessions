            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code successfully identified separators (magenta lines) and extracted the panels (subgrids) defined by them. It also correctly determined the output arrangement axis (vertical if vertical separators exist, horizontal otherwise) and handled the ordering for cases with only horizontal separators (reverse order) and only vertical separators (standard reading order).\n\nHowever, the code failed on Example 1, which contains *both* horizontal and vertical separators. The implemented logic for this \"Both\" case (vertical arrangement, column-major panel order) did not match the expected output's panel order. The expected order in Example 1 appears to be a specific permutation (Top-Left, Bottom-Right, Top-Right, Bottom-Left) when arranged vertically.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the panel ordering logic specifically for the case where both horizontal and vertical separators are present, based on the pattern observed in Example 1, while keeping the logic for the other two cases (H-only, V-only) as they appear correct based on Examples 2 and 3.\n\n## Metrics and Observations\n\nLet's gather specific metrics for each example.\n\n"

Record each panel along with its original top-left coordinates in the input grid.\n3.  **Determine Scenario and Arrangement:**\n    *   **Scenario 1: No Separators:** If neither horizontal nor vertical separators are found, the transformation is complete, and the output grid is identical to the input grid.\n    *   **Scenario 2: Only Horizontal Separators (H-Only):** If only horizontal separators are found, the output panels will be arranged horizontally.\n    *   **Scenario 3: Only Vertical Separators (V-Only):** If only vertical separators are found, the output panels will be arranged vertically.\n    *   **Scenario 4: Both Horizontal and Vertical Separators (Both):** If both types of separators are found, the output panels will be arranged vertically.\n4.  **Order Panels:**\n    *   Establish a 'base order' for the extracted panels by sorting them based on their original top-left coordinates, first by row index (top-to-bottom), then by column index (left-to-right). Let the panels in this base order be indexed starting from 0.\n    *   **If Scenario 2 (H-Only):** Reverse the base order to get the final panel order.\n    *   **If Scenario 3 (V-Only):** Use the base order as the final panel order.\n    *   **If Scenario 4 (Both):** Assuming the separators define a 2x2 grid of panels (resulting in 4 panels in the base order indexed 0, 1, 2, 3), rearrange the panels from the base order into the final order: [panel 0, panel 3, panel 1, panel 2].\n5.  **Assemble Output Grid:**\n    *   **If Arranging Vertically (Scenarios 3 or 4):** Create the output grid by stacking the panels in their final determined order. Insert a single horizontal separator row (all magenta pixels, width matching the panels) between each adjacent pair of panels.\n    *   **If Arranging Horizontally (Scenario 2):** Create the output grid by concatenating the panels side-by-side in their final determined order. Insert a single vertical separator column (all magenta pixels, height matching the panels) between each adjacent pair of panels.\n6.  **Return Output:** The assembled grid is the final output."
