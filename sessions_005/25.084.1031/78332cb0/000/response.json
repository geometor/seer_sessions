The task involves extracting these panels and rearranging them into a new grid, either stacked vertically or concatenated horizontally, with magenta separators placed between the rearranged panels. The specific arrangement (vertical vs. horizontal) and the order of panels depend on the orientation of the separators in the input grid.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Determine the order of the panels for the output arrangement:\n        *   If arranging vertically: Order the panels based on their top-left corner's position in the input grid, first by row index (top-to-bottom), then by column index (left-to-right).\n        *   If arranging horizontally: Order the panels based on their top-left corner's position in the input grid, first by row index (top-to-bottom), then by column index (left-to-right). Then, reverse this sequence of panels.\n    5.  Construct the output grid:\n        *   If arranging vertically: Stack the ordered panels one below the other, inserting a single row of magenta pixels between each adjacent pair of panels. The width of the output grid will match the width of the panels.\n        *   If arranging horizontally: Concatenate the ordered panels side-by-side, inserting a single column of magenta pixels between each adjacent pair of panels. The height of the output grid will match the height of the panels."
