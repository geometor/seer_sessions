objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - rows: Integer (variable, 1-30)
      - columns: Integer (variable, 1-30)
      - pixels: Matrix of Integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: separator
    properties:
      - orientation: horizontal | vertical
      - color: magenta (6)
      - extent: spans the full width (horizontal) or height (vertical) of the grid
      - location: specific row index (horizontal) or column index (vertical)
  - type: panel
    properties:
      - definition: rectangular subgrid bounded by separators or grid edges
      - content: pixels from the input grid, excluding separators
      - original_position: top-left coordinate (row, column) in the input grid

actions:
  - name: identify_separators
    input: grid
    output: list of horizontal separator row indices, list of vertical separator column indices
    description: Find all full rows and columns consisting only of magenta pixels.
  - name: extract_panels
    input: grid, separator indices
    output: list of panels, each with its original top-left coordinate
    description: Divide the grid into subgrids based on separator locations.
  - name: determine_arrangement
    input: separator indices
    output: arrangement axis ('Vertical' | 'Horizontal'), ordering rule
    description: >
      If vertical separators exist, the arrangement axis is 'Vertical'.
      Otherwise, if horizontal separators exist, the axis is 'Horizontal'.
      Otherwise, no rearrangement occurs.
      The ordering rule depends on the combination of separators found.
  - name: order_panels
    input: list of panels with coordinates, arrangement axis, separator combination (Both, H-only, V-only)
    output: ordered list of panels
    description: >
      Sorts panels based on original coordinates (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right) as a primary step.
      If arranging horizontally (H-only): Reverse the sorted order.
      If arranging vertically:
        If both H and V separators were present: Reorder based on a specific permutation (e.g., main diagonal then anti-diagonal traversal of the conceptual panel grid).
        If only V separators were present: Use the primary sorted order.
  - name: assemble_output
    input: ordered list of panels, arrangement axis
    output: output grid
    description: >
      Concatenate the ordered panels along the specified axis.
      Insert single magenta separators (rows for vertical, columns for horizontal) between adjacent panels.
