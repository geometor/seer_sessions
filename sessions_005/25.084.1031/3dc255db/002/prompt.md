"""
Identify pixels of a specific "target" color that are orthogonally adjacent 
to pixels of a corresponding "trigger" color, and change those target pixels 
to white (0). All other pixels retain their original color.

The defined target-trigger color pairs are:
- Target: Magenta (6), Trigger: Yellow (4)
- Target: Orange (7), Trigger: Green (3)
- Target: Maroon (9), Trigger: Green (3)
- Target: Maroon (9), Trigger: Magenta (6)
- Target: Orange (7), Trigger: Magenta (6)
