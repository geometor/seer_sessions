            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both inputs and outputs are 2D grids of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The background is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** The grids contain distinct objects, which are contiguous areas of non-white colors. These objects vary in shape, size, and color across the examples.\n3.  **Colors Involved:** The key colors appearing in the transformations seem to be:\n    *   Yellow (4), Magenta (6)\n    *   Green (3), Orange (7)\n    *   Green (3), Maroon (9)\n    *   Magenta (6), Maroon (9)\n    *   Magenta (6), Orange (7)\n4.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation appears to involve changing certain pixels to white (0). This change seems conditional based on the pixel's color and the color of its immediate neighbors. Specifically, pixels of one color (e.g., Magenta) are turned white if they are orthogonally adjacent (share an edge, not just a corner) to pixels of another specific color (e.g., Yellow).\n5.  **Color Pairs:** Specific pairs of colors trigger this transformation:\n    *   Magenta (6) is removed if adjacent to Yellow (4). (train_1)\n    *   Orange (7) is removed if adjacent to Green (3). (train_1)\n    *   Maroon (9) is removed if adjacent to Green (3). (train_2)\n    *   Maroon (9) is removed if adjacent to Magenta (6). (train_2)\n    *   Orange (7) is removed if adjacent to Magenta (6). (train_3)\n6.  **Consistency:** This adjacency-based removal rule holds across all three training examples for the specified color pairs.\n7.  **Anomalies:** In all three output examples, there are *new* pixels added (Magenta/Orange in train_1, Maroon in train_2, Orange in train_3) that were not present in the input and are not explained by the adjacency removal rule. Their positions seem arbitrary relative to the main transformation. These might be part of a secondary rule, noise, or an aspect I haven't fully grasped yet. However, the removal rule is clear and consistent.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

For the current pixel at `(row, col)`:\n    *   Check if its color is one of the defined Target Colors.\n    *   If it is a Target Color, then examine its four orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right) in the *input* grid. Be careful not to go outside the grid boundaries.\n    *   Check if any of these neighbors have the corresponding Trigger Color for the current pixel's Target Color.\n    *   If at least one neighbor has the Trigger Color, change the color of the pixel at `(row, col)` in the *output grid template* to White (0).\n5.  If the current pixel's color is not a Target Color, or if it is a Target Color but none of its orthogonal neighbors have the corresponding Trigger Color, its value in the output grid template remains unchanged (i.e., it keeps its original input color).\n6.  After iterating through all pixels in the input grid, the modified output grid template is the final output.\n7.  **(Note:** This program accounts for the observed pixel removals/whitening based on adjacency but does *not* account for the unexplained pixels added in the example outputs.)"
