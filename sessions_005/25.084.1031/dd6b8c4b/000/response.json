The background color is predominantly orange (7).\n2.  **Key Object:** The central feature in each input is a 3x3 area containing mostly green (3) pixels and a single red (2) pixel, typically near the center of the 3x3 area.\n3.  **Variations:**\n    *   **Magenta Border:** In Examples 1 and 2, the 3x3 green/red block is immediately surrounded by a border of magenta (6) pixels. In Example 3, this border is absent.\n    *   **Maroon Pixels:** Maroon (9) pixels are present in all examples, sometimes scattered, sometimes clustered. Their presence and proximity to the central 3x3 block seem crucial.\n4.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation modifies the colors within the 3x3 green/red block. The specific changes depend on two factors:\n    *   The presence or absence of the magenta (6) border around the block.\n    *   The proximity of any maroon (9) pixel to the block (or its border, if present).\n5.  **Secondary Transformations:**\n    *   In Example 3 (no border), isolated maroon (9) pixels (those with no maroon neighbors) are changed to orange (7).\n    *   In Example 1 (border present, no adjacent maroon), a single magenta (6) pixel, seemingly outside the main border but adjacent to maroon pixels, changes to orange (7). This might be a separate sub-rule or related to the maroon adjacency check.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
