task_context:
  grid_size: fixed 11x11 for both input and output.
  primary_colors:
    - orange (7): Background, generally static.
    - green (3): Forms a 3x3 block with red. Target of modification.
    - red (2): Single pixel within the green block. Target of modification.
    - magenta (6): Forms an optional border around the green/red block. Can change under specific conditions.
    - maroon (9): Appears scattered. Acts as a conditional trigger and can change under specific conditions.
objects:
  - object: central_block
    description: A 3x3 area composed primarily of green (3) pixels and a single red (2) pixel.
    properties:
      - location: [row, column] of the top-left corner.
      - red_pixel_location: [row, column] of the red (2) pixel within the block.
      - has_magenta_border: boolean, indicates if the block is immediately surrounded by magenta (6) pixels.
  - object: maroon_pixels
    description: Pixels with value 9.
    properties:
      - locations: list of [row, column] coordinates.
      - is_adjacent_to_block: boolean, indicates if any maroon pixel is adjacent (including diagonals) to the central_block or its magenta border (if present).
      - is_isolated: boolean, indicates if a maroon pixel has no neighbours (including diagonals) of the same color (maroon).
  - object: magenta_pixels
    description: Pixels with value 6.
    properties:
      - locations: list of [row, column] coordinates.
      - part_of_border: boolean, indicates if the pixel belongs to the immediate border around the central_block.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Determines if pixels are next to each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Used for checking maroon proximity and isolation, and defining the magenta border.
  - type: relative_position
    description: Used to identify pixels relative to the red pixel within the central_block (e.g., top-left, above, left).
actions:
  - action: identify_block_and_properties
    description: Locate the 3x3 green/red block, find the red pixel, and determine if a magenta border exists.
  - action: check_maroon_adjacency
    description: Determine if any maroon pixel is adjacent to the block or its border.
  - action: modify_block_case_border_present
    description: Change pixels within the block based on maroon adjacency.
      - if adjacent maroon: Change all green (3) and the red (2) to maroon (9).
      - if no adjacent maroon: Change specific green (3) pixels (relative to red pixel) to maroon (9).
  - action: modify_block_case_border_absent
    description: Change pixels within the block based on relative position to the original red pixel location. Change red (2) to green (3).
  - action: modify_isolated_maroons
    description: Change isolated maroon (9) pixels to orange (7) (only when no magenta border is present).
  - action: modify_stray_magentas (potential)
    description: Change magenta (6) pixels not part of the border but adjacent to maroon (9) to orange (7) (only when magenta border is present and no maroon is adjacent to the block).
