"""
Processes a grid based on the value in the first column of each row.

1. Iterate through each row of the input grid.
2. If the first pixel (column 0) of a row is magenta (6):
   a. Check if all other pixels in that row (from column 1 onwards) are orange (7).
   b. If they are all orange, change the first pixel to orange (7) and the last pixel to magenta (6).
   c. If they are *not* all orange, find the rightmost orange (7) pixel in that row and change it to magenta (6). The initial magenta pixel at column 0 remains unchanged in this case.
3. If the first pixel of a row is not magenta (6), leave the row unchanged.
4. Return the modified grid.
