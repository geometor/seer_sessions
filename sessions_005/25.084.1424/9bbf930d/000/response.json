These lines are separated by rows that are predominantly orange.\n    *   The core transformation involves modifying pixels in rows that contain a magenta (6) pixel in the first column.\n    *   Two distinct transformation patterns emerge based on the content of these magenta-starting rows:\n        1.  If a row starts with magenta (6) and the rest of the row consists *only* of orange (7) pixels, the magenta pixel at the beginning moves to the end of the row, and the original starting position becomes orange.\n        2.  If a row starts with magenta (6) but contains colors *other than* orange elsewhere in the row, the *rightmost* orange (7) pixel within that row changes to magenta (6). The initial magenta pixel remains unchanged in this case.\n    *   Rows that do not start with magenta (6) remain unchanged between input and output.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
