Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids are large and contain a dominant background color (azure 8 in example 1, yellow 4 in example 2). Scattered within this background are several smaller, distinct objects made of various other colors.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are smaller than the inputs and seem to be constructed by extracting specific objects from the input and arranging them side-by-side horizontally.
3.  **Object Selection:** Not all objects from the input appear in the output. There must be a specific criterion for selecting which objects to extract.
    *   In example 1, the selected objects are associated with the color maroon (9), which appears to frame or be directly adjacent to them. The unselected green object has no maroon nearby.
    *   In example 2, the selected objects contain the color azure (8). The unselected objects do not contain azure.
4.  **Arrangement:** The selected objects are placed horizontally in the output. The order of arrangement appears to depend on the selection criterion:
    *   In example 1 (maroon selection), the object originally further to the right in the input appears first (leftmost) in the output. The order is right-to-left based on original horizontal position.
    *   In example 2 (azure selection), the object originally further to the left in the input appears first (leftmost) in the output. The order is left-to-right based on original horizontal position.
5.  **Extraction:** The exact bounding box of the selected objects (potentially including any 'frame' color like maroon in example 1, or just the object pixels if selected based on internal content like in example 2) is extracted and used in the output.

**Facts**


```yaml
- task: Identify and assemble specific objects from the input grid.
- properties:
    - background_color: The most frequent color in the input grid.
    - objects: Contiguous regions of non-background colors.
    - target_objects: A subset of objects selected based on specific criteria.
    - selection_criterion_color: A specific color used to identify target objects, either by adjacency/framing (maroon 9) or containment (azure 8).
    - bounding_box: The minimal rectangular area enclosing a target object.
- actions:
    - find_background: Determine the most frequent color.
    - segment_objects: Identify all connected components of non-background colors.
    - identify_criterion: Determine if selection is based on adjacency to maroon (9) or containment of azure (8).
    - filter_objects: Select only the target objects based on the identified criterion.
    - calculate_bounding_boxes: Find the bounding box for each target object.
    - sort_objects: Arrange the target objects horizontally based on their original position and the selection criterion.
        - If criterion involves maroon (9), sort by descending column index (right-to-left).
        - If criterion involves azure (8), sort by ascending column index (left-to-right).
    - extract_subgrids: Get the pixel data within each target object's bounding box.
    - concatenate_horizontally: Combine the extracted subgrids side-by-side in the determined order.
- relationships:
    - Objects are distinct from the background.
    - Target objects are identified relative to the selection_criterion_color (maroon 9 or azure 8).
    - The final output grid is composed of the extracted subgrids of the target objects.
    - The horizontal order of subgrids in the output depends on both their original horizontal position and the specific selection_criterion_color used.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the most frequent color in the input grid; this is the background color.
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects formed by pixels that are not the background color.
3.  Determine the selection rule:
    a.  Check if any objects are directly adjacent to (or framed by) maroon (9) pixels. If yes, the selection criterion is adjacency to maroon (9).
    b.  Otherwise, check if any objects contain azure (8) pixels. If yes, the selection criterion is containment of azure (8).
4.  Select the target objects: Filter the identified objects, keeping only those that satisfy the determined selection criterion (either adjacent to maroon 9 or containing azure 8).
5.  For each target object, determine its minimal bounding box (the smallest rectangle enclosing all its pixels).
6.  Determine the assembly order for the target objects:
    a.  If the selection criterion was adjacency to maroon (9), sort the target objects based on the column index of the leftmost pixel of their bounding boxes, in descending order (rightmost object first).
    b.  If the selection criterion was containment of azure (8), sort the target objects based on the column index of the leftmost pixel of their bounding boxes, in ascending order (leftmost object first).
7.  Extract the subgrid (the rectangular block of pixels) defined by the bounding box of each target object.
8.  Create the output grid by concatenating these extracted subgrids horizontally, side-by-side, following the determined assembly order.
