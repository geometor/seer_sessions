Scattered within this background are several smaller, distinct objects made of various other colors.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are smaller than the inputs and seem to be constructed by extracting specific objects from the input and arranging them side-by-side horizontally.\n3.  **Object Selection:** Not all objects from the input appear in the output. There must be a specific criterion for selecting which objects to extract.\n    *   In example 1, the selected objects are associated with the color maroon (9), which appears to frame or be directly adjacent to them. The unselected green object has no maroon nearby.\n    *   In example 2, the selected objects contain the color azure (8). The unselected objects do not contain azure.\n4.  **Arrangement:** The selected objects are placed horizontally in the output. The order of arrangement appears to depend on the selection criterion:\n    *   In example 1 (maroon selection), the object originally further to the right in the input appears first (leftmost) in the output. The order is right-to-left based on original horizontal position.\n    *   In example 2 (azure selection), the object originally further to the left in the input appears first (leftmost) in the output. The order is left-to-right based on original horizontal position.\n5.  **Extraction:** The exact bounding box of the selected objects (potentially including any 'frame' color like maroon in example 1, or just the object pixels if selected based on internal content like in example 2) is extracted and used in the output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

For each target object, determine its minimal bounding box (the smallest rectangle enclosing all its pixels).\n6.  Determine the assembly order for the target objects:\n    a.  If the selection criterion was adjacency to maroon (9), sort the target objects based on the column index of the leftmost pixel of their bounding boxes, in descending order (rightmost object first).\n    b.
