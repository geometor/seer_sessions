- task: Identify and assemble specific objects from the input grid.
- properties:
    - background_color: The most frequent color in the input grid.
    - objects: Contiguous regions of non-background colors.
    - target_objects: A subset of objects selected based on specific criteria.
    - selection_criterion_color: A specific color used to identify target objects, either by adjacency/framing (maroon 9) or containment (azure 8).
    - bounding_box: The minimal rectangular area enclosing a target object.
- actions:
    - find_background: Determine the most frequent color.
    - segment_objects: Identify all connected components of non-background colors.
    - identify_criterion: Determine if selection is based on adjacency to maroon (9) or containment of azure (8).
    - filter_objects: Select only the target objects based on the identified criterion.
    - calculate_bounding_boxes: Find the bounding box for each target object.
    - sort_objects: Arrange the target objects horizontally based on their original position and the selection criterion.
        - If criterion involves maroon (9), sort by descending column index (right-to-left).
        - If criterion involves azure (8), sort by ascending column index (left-to-right).
    - extract_subgrids: Get the pixel data within each target object's bounding box.
    - concatenate_horizontally: Combine the extracted subgrids side-by-side in the determined order.
- relationships:
    - Objects are distinct from the background.
    - Target objects are identified relative to the selection_criterion_color (maroon 9 or azure 8).
    - The final output grid is composed of the extracted subgrids of the target objects.
    - The horizontal order of subgrids in the output depends on both their original horizontal position and the specific selection_criterion_color used.
