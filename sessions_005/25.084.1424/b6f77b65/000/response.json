Let's call this the \"control pixel\".\n    *   The rest of the grid (excluding row 0 and column 0, which are mostly white except for the control pixel) contains various colored shapes or patterns against a white background.\n    *   Comparing inputs and outputs, the primary transformation appears to be a vertical (downward) shift of the grid content, excluding the control pixel.\n    *   The amount of the downward shift seems to be determined by the color (value) of the control pixel.\n    *   The control pixel itself remains unchanged in the output grid at position (0,0).\n    *   When the content is shifted down, the rows at the top (below row 0) that become empty are filled with the background color (white, 0).\n    *   Content shifted beyond the bottom boundary of the grid is lost.\n    *   Example 1 shows the case where the input and output are identical, suggesting a shift of 0 rows corresponds to the control pixel color (maroon, 9).\n    *   Other examples show different shift amounts based on the control pixel's color: Yellow (4) causes a 3-row shift, Magenta (6) causes a 2-row shift, and Orange (7) causes a 5-row shift.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
