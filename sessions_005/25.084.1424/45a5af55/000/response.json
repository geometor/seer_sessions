The width of the input grid seems irrelevant to the transformation.\n    *   The output grids are significantly larger square grids composed of nested square frames, culminating in a solid square center.\n    *   The colors used in the output are the same as those present in the input stripes.\n    *   There's a direct relationship between the sequence of stripes in the input (read top-to-bottom) and the sequence of frames in the output (read outside-to-inside).\n    *   The thickness of each horizontal stripe in the input (number of rows) determines the thickness of the corresponding frame in the output, or the size of the central square for the last stripe.\n    *   The size of the output grid is determined by the sum of the thicknesses of the input stripes. Specifically, if the thicknesses are t1, t2, ..., tN, the output dimension is `2 * (t1 + ... + tN-1) + tN`.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

A stripe is a contiguous block of one or more identical rows.\n    2.  For each stripe, record its color and its thickness (the number of rows it occupies). Let this sequence be `(color_1, thickness_1), (color_2, thickness_2), ..., (color_N, thickness_N)`.\n    3.  Calculate the dimension `D` for the square output grid: `D = (2 * sum(thickness_i for i from 1 to N-1)) + thickness_N`.\n    4.  Create a new square grid of size `D x D`.\n    5.  Initialize a variable `current_offset` to 0.\n    6.  Iterate through the stripes from `i = 1` to `N-1`:\n        a.  Get the color `color_i` and thickness `thickness_i`.\n        b.  Draw a square frame within the output grid using `color_i`. This frame has a thickness of `thickness_i`. Its outer boundary starts at row `current_offset` and column `current_offset`, and ends at row `D - 1 - current_offset` and column `D - 1 - current_offset`.\n        c.  Update the offset: `current_offset = current_offset + thickness_i`.\n    7.  Get the color `color_N` and thickness `thickness_N` of the last stripe (the N-th stripe).\n    8.  Fill the central rectangular area of the output grid with `color_N`. This area starts at row `current_offset` and column `current_offset`, and has dimensions `thickness_N x thickness_N`.\n    9.  Return the constructed output grid."
