Analyze the input grid to identify the sequence of horizontal stripes. A stripe\n    is a contiguous block of one or more identical rows.\n2.  For each stripe, record its color (from any cell in the stripe) and its\n    thickness (the number of rows it occupies). Store these as a list of\n    (color, thickness) pairs in top-to-bottom order.\n3.  Calculate the dimension `D` for the square output grid. If the thicknesses are\n    t1, t2, ..., tN, then D = (2 * sum(t1 to tN-1)) + tN. If N=1, D = t1.\n4.  Create a new square grid of size D x D, initially filled with a placeholder or\n    the color of the outermost frame.\n5.  Iterate through the stripes from the first (index 0) to the second-to-last\n    (index N-2). For each stripe `i` with `(color_i, thickness_i)`:\n    a.  Determine the current boundary based on the thicknesses of the stripes\n        already processed. Let `current_offset` be the sum of thicknesses of\n        stripes 0 to `i-1`.\n    b.  Draw the frame: Fill the top `thickness_i` rows, bottom `thickness_i` rows,\n        left `thickness_i` columns, and right `thickness_i` columns within the\n        square defined by `(current_offset, current_offset)` and\n        `(D - current_offset - 1, D - current_offset - 1)` with `color_i`.\n    c.  Update `current_offset` by adding `thickness_i`.\n6.  After processing the frames, take the last stripe `(color_N, thickness_N)`.\n7.  Fill the central square area of the output grid with `color_N`. This area\n    starts at `(current_offset, current_offset)` and has dimensions\n    `thickness_N x thickness_N`.\n8.  Return the constructed output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef _identify_stripes(input_grid_np):\n    \"\"\"Identifies horizontal stripes and their properties.\"\"\"\n    stripes = []\n    height = input_grid_np.shape[0]\n    if height == 0:\n        return stripes\n        \n    r = 0\n    while r < height:\n        # Get the representative row for the current stripe\n        current_row = input_grid_np[r]\n        # Assuming all rows in a valid stripe are identical, color is the same everywhere\n        # Check if row is non-empty before accessing index 0\n        if current_row.size > 0:\n             color = current_row[0]\n        else:\n             # Handle empty rows if necessary, maybe assign a default color or skip\n             color = 0 # Default to 'white' or handle as error/special case\n        \n        thickness = 1\n        # Find the total thickness of this stripe\n        k = r + 1\n        while k < height and np.array_equal(input_grid_np[k], current_row):\n            thickness += 1\n            k += 1\n            \n        stripes.append((color, thickness))\n        # Move the row pointer past the current stripe\n        r += thickness\n        \n    return stripes\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on stripe information into nested frames.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # 1 & 2: Identify stripes (color, thickness)\n    stripes = _identify_stripes(input_grid_np)\n    \n    if not stripes:\n        # Handle empty input case\n        return [] \n        \n    num_stripes = len(stripes)\n    \n    # 3: Calculate output dimension D\n    if num_stripes == 1:\n        last_thickness = stripes[0][1]\n        sum_prev_thicknesses = 0\n    else:\n        last_thickness = stripes[-1][1]\n        sum_prev_thicknesses = sum(t for _, t in stripes[:-1])\n        \n    dimension = (2 * sum_prev_thicknesses) + last_thickness\n    \n    # 4: Create output grid (initialize with a value not expected, like -1, or use first color)\n    # Let's initialize with 0 (white), common background\n    output_grid = np.zeros((dimension, dimension), dtype=int) \n    \n    # 5 & 6: Draw frames\n    current_offset = 0\n    for i in range(num_stripes - 1):\n        color, thickness = stripes[i]\n        \n        # Define the boundaries for the current frame drawing\n        start = current_offset\n        end = dimension - current_offset \n        \n        # Fill top border rows\n        output_grid[start : start + thickness, start:end] = color\n        # Fill bottom border rows\n        output_grid[end - thickness : end, start:end] = color\n        # Fill left border columns (between top and bottom borders)\n        output_grid[start + thickness : end - thickness, start : start + thickness] = color\n        # Fill right border columns (between top and bottom borders)\n        output_grid[start + thickness : end - thickness, end - thickness : end] = color\n        \n        # Update offset for the next inner frame/center\n        current_offset += thickness\n        \n    # 7: Fill the center square with the last stripe's color\n    if num_stripes > 0:\n        center_color, center_thickness = stripes[-1]\n        start = current_offset\n        # The end index for slicing should be start + thickness\n        end = start + center_thickness \n        \n        # Verify calculation: D - current_offset should equal end\n        # D - offset = (2*sum_prev + last_thick) - sum_prev = sum_prev + last_thick\n        # start + thick = sum_prev + last_thick.
