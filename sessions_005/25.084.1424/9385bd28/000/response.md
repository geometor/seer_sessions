*   **Perception of the Elements:**
    *   The input grids contain a background color and several smaller objects composed of different colors.
    *   The background color is typically the most frequent color in the input grid (white (0) in examples 1, 2, 4; green (3) in example 3).
    *   The output grids retain the original objects in their original positions.
    *   The key transformation involves filling regions of the background color with new colors.
    *   The color used to fill a background region is determined by the color of the non-background object(s) adjacent to that region.
    *   The fill seems to expand outwards from the non-background objects into the connected background area, stopping when it meets another object or a fill expanding from a different object. This suggests a process akin to calculating the nearest non-background colored pixel for each background pixel.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Fill background regions based on the color of adjacent non-background objects.

    elements:
      - role: background
        property: Most frequent color in the input grid.
        examples:
          - train_1: white (0)
          - train_2: white (0)
          - train_3: green (3)
          - train_4: white (0)
      - role: objects
        property: Contiguous blocks of non-background colors.
        examples:
          - train_1: red (2), blue (1) objects
          - train_2: yellow (4), blue (1), red (3), gray (5) objects
          - train_3: gray (5), red (2), yellow (4), blue (1), magenta (6), maroon (9), white (0), azure (8) objects
          - train_4: green (3), yellow (4), magenta (6), orange (7) objects
      - role: fill_regions
        property: Areas in the output grid corresponding to background areas in the input grid, now filled with a specific color.
      - role: fill_color
        property: The color used to fill a specific background region. Determined by the color of the adjacent non-background object(s).

    relationships:
      - type: adjacency
        description: Non-background object pixels are adjacent (8-way, including diagonals) to background pixels. This adjacency triggers the fill.
      - type: determination
        description: The color of a non-background pixel adjacent to the background determines the fill color for that part of the background.
      - type: propagation/expansion
        description: The fill color spreads outwards from the adjacent non-background object pixels into the connected background region.
      - type: boundary
        description: The fill stops when it encounters a non-background pixel or a region being filled by a different color.

    actions:
      - name: identify_background
        description: Determine the most frequent color in the input grid.
      - name: identify_objects
        description: Identify all pixels that are not the background color.
      - name: find_border_pixels
        description: Locate non-background pixels that are adjacent (8-way) to at least one background pixel.
      - name: fill_background
        description: Iteratively or simultaneously expand the color from each border pixel into adjacent background pixels, replacing the background color. Continue expansion until all reachable background pixels are filled or meet another fill/object boundary. This is similar to a Voronoi diagram calculation where the "sites" are the non-background pixels and the space is the background region.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the background color by finding the most frequent color in the input grid.
    2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    3.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are *not* the background color. These are the "object pixels".
    4.  For each pixel in the grid:
        a.  If the pixel in the input grid has the background color:
            i.  Find the nearest "object pixel" (using Manhattan or Chebyshev distance - Chebyshev seems more appropriate given the diagonal spread observed).
            ii. If a nearest object pixel is found, change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the color of that nearest object pixel. If there are multiple nearest object pixels with different colors at the same minimum distance, a tie-breaking rule might be needed (though not explicitly evident how ties are broken in the examples, perhaps the original object pixel position matters, or it might not occur in test cases). A simpler approach matching the visual expansion:
    5.  Alternative/Refined Step 4 (Simultaneous Expansion):
        a.  Initialize a distance grid with infinity for all background pixels and 0 for all non-background pixels. Initialize a color grid matching the input.
        b.  Create a queue containing all non-background pixels adjacent (8-way) to background pixels.
        c.  While the queue is not empty:
            i.  Dequeue a pixel `P`.
            ii. For each background neighbor `N` of `P` (8-way adjacency):
                *   If `N` has not yet been assigned a color (or is still background color in the output grid being built):
                    *   Assign the color of `P` to `N` in the output grid.
                    *   Enqueue `N`.
        *(Self-correction: The above BFS doesn't guarantee the "closest" property correctly if fills start simultaneously. A better approach might be a multi-source BFS or Dijkstra-like expansion.)*
    6.  **Revised Step 4 (Multi-Source Expansion/Closest Color):**
        a. Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
        b. Create a set `Q` of "active" pixels, initially containing all non-background pixels from the input grid.
        c. While `Q` is not empty:
            i. Create an empty set `next_Q` for the next iteration.
            ii. Create a dictionary `updates` to store potential color changes for background pixels `{ (row, col): color }`.
            iii. For each pixel `P(r, c)` with color `C` in `Q`:
                *   Examine its 8 neighbors `N(nr, nc)`.
                *   If neighbor `N` is currently the background color in the output grid:
                    *   If `(nr, nc)` is not already in `updates` or if `updates[(nr, nc)]` is the background color, store `updates[(nr, nc)] = C`.
                    *   *(Tie-breaking if needed: If `(nr, nc)` is in `updates` with a different color `C'`, a rule is needed. The examples don't clearly show tie-breaking; assume simultaneous expansion stops boundaries mutually, or perhaps lower color index wins? Let's stick to the simpler model first: first color to reach claims the pixel for this step).*
            iv. For each coordinate `(r, c)` and color `C` in `updates`:
                *   If the pixel `(r, c)` in the output grid is still the background color:
                    *   Change the color of pixel `(r, c)` in the output grid to `C`.
                    *   Add the pixel `(r, c)` (now with color `C`) to `next_Q`.
            v. Set `Q = next_Q`.
    7.  Return the modified output grid.
