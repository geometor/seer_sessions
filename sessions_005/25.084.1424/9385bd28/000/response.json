This suggests a process akin to calculating the nearest non-background colored pixel for each background pixel.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n    3.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are *not* the background color. These are the \"object pixels\".\n    4.  For each pixel in the grid:\n        a.  If the pixel in the input grid has the background color:\n            i.  Find the nearest \"object pixel\" (using Manhattan or Chebyshev distance - Chebyshev seems more appropriate given the diagonal spread observed).\n            ii. If a nearest object pixel is found, change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the color of that nearest object pixel. If there are multiple nearest object pixels with different colors at the same minimum distance, a tie-breaking rule might be needed (though not explicitly evident how ties are broken in the examples, perhaps the original object pixel position matters, or it might not occur in test cases). A simpler approach matching the visual expansion:\n    5.  Alternative/Refined Step 4 (Simultaneous Expansion):\n        a.  Initialize a distance grid with infinity for all background pixels and 0 for all non-background pixels. Initialize a color grid matching the input.\n        b.  Create a queue containing all non-background pixels adjacent (8-way) to background pixels.\n        c.  While the queue is not empty:\n            i.  Dequeue a pixel `P`.\n            ii. For each background neighbor `N` of `P` (8-way adjacency):\n                *   If `N` has not yet been assigned a color (or is still background color in the output grid being built):\n                    *   Assign the color of `P` to `N` in the output grid.\n                    *   Enqueue `N`.\n        *(Self-correction: The above BFS doesn't guarantee the \"closest\" property correctly if fills start simultaneously. A better approach might be a multi-source BFS or Dijkstra-like expansion.)*\n    6.  **Revised Step 4 (Multi-Source Expansion/Closest Color):**\n        a. Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.\n        b. Create a set `Q` of \"active\" pixels, initially containing all non-background pixels from the input grid.\n        c. While `Q` is not empty:\n            i. Create an empty set `next_Q` for the next iteration.\n            ii. Create a dictionary `updates` to store potential color changes for background pixels `{ (row, col): color }`.\n            iii. For each pixel `P(r, c)` with color `C` in `Q`:\n                *   Examine its 8 neighbors `N(nr, nc)`.\n                *   If neighbor `N` is currently the background color in the output grid:\n                    *   If `(nr, nc)` is not already in `updates` or if `updates[(nr, nc)]` is the background color, store `updates[(nr, nc)] = C`.\n                    *   *(Tie-breaking if needed: If `(nr, nc)` is in `updates` with a different color `C'`, a rule is needed. The examples don't clearly show tie-breaking; assume simultaneous expansion stops boundaries mutually, or perhaps lower color index wins? Let's stick to the simpler model first: first color to reach claims the pixel for this step).*\n            iv. For each coordinate `(r, c)` and color `C` in `updates`:\n                *   If the pixel `(r, c)` in the output grid is still the background color:\n                    *   Change the color of pixel `(r, c)` in the output grid to `C`.\n                    *   Add the pixel `(r, c)` (now with color `C`) to `next_Q`.\n            v. Set `Q = next_Q`.\n    7.  Return the modified output grid."
