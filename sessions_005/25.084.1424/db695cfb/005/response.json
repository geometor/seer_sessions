If only blue/magenta exist or the grid is empty otherwise, use white (0) as the background.\n3.  **Determine Actual Destinations**:\n    *   If any magenta pixels exist, they are the 'actual destinations'.\n    *   If no magenta pixels exist, the blue pixels themselves serve as the 'actual destinations' for each other (a blue pixel cannot be its own destination).\n4.  **Path Generation and Drawing**:\n    *   Iterate through every unique pair of a source pixel `S` and an actual destination pixel `D`.\n    *   If `S` is the same pixel as `D`, skip this pair.\n    *   Determine the `path_color` which is the color of the destination pixel `D` in the *original input grid*.\n    *   Calculate a path sequence from `S` towards `D`:\n        *   Start at `current_pos = S`. Maintain a set `visited_on_this_path` containing only `S`.\n        *   While true (loop broken internally):\n            *   If `current_pos` is adjacent (Manhattan distance <= 1) to `D`, stop calculating this path segment (reached destination proximity).\n            *   Find all valid 8-directional neighbors of `current_pos`, sorted by row then column index.\n            *   Filter out the neighbor if it *is* `D`.\n            *   Calculate the Manhattan distance from each remaining neighbor to `D`.\n            *   If no valid neighbors remain (excluding `D`), stop calculating this path segment.\n            *   Find the minimum distance (`min_dist`) among these neighbors.\n            *   Identify all neighbors (`min_dist_neighbors`) that achieve this `min_dist`.\n            *   Apply tie-breaking to select the `next_step_info` (containing position and move delta) from `min_dist_neighbors`:\n                1.  Prefer neighbors reached by a diagonal move (change in both row and column) over axial moves (change in only row or column).\n                2.  If ties remain within diagonal or axial groups, the pre-sorting by row/column (from `get_neighbors`) determines the choice (smallest row, then smallest column).\n            *   Get the selected `next_pos` from `next_step_info`.\n            *   If `next_pos` is already in `visited_on_this_path`, stop calculating this path segment (cycle detected).\n            *   Mark `next_pos`: If the pixel at `next_pos` in the *current output grid* has the `background_color`, change its color to `path_color`.\n            *   Add `next_pos` to `visited_on_this_path`.\n            *   Update `current_pos = next_pos`.\n5.  **Final Output**: Return the modified output grid after processing all source-destination pairs.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_pixels(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds all coordinates (row, col) of pixels with a specific color.\"\"\"\n    return list(zip(*np.where(grid == color)))\n\ndef get_background_color(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds the most common color excluding blue (1) and magenta (6).\"\"\"\n    counts = Counter(grid.flatten())\n    # Remove source and potential destination colors from candidates\n    if 1 in counts:\n        del counts[1]\n    if 6 in counts:\n        del counts[6]\n\n    if not counts:\n        # Fallback if only blue/magenta exist, or grid is empty\n        all_counts = Counter(grid.flatten())\n        if 0 in all_counts:\n             return 0 # Default to white if available\n        elif all_counts:\n             # This case is unlikely in ARC but handles if only e.g. blue exists\n             return all_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]\n        else:\n             return 0 # Default for truly empty grid\n\n    # Return the most frequent remaining color\n    return counts.most_common(1)[0][0]\n\ndef manhattan_distance(p1, p2):\n    \"\"\"Calculates Manhattan distance between two points (tuples).\"\"\"\n    return abs(p1[0] - p2[0]) + abs(p1[1] - p2[1])\n\ndef get_neighbors(r, c, height, width):\n    \"\"\"Gets valid 8-directional neighbors for a given coordinate.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains:\n              ((neighbor_row, neighbor_col), (delta_row, delta_col)).\n              Sorted by row, then column index.\n    \"\"\"\n    neighbors = []\n    # Order matters for tie-breaking: check smaller row/col first implicitly\n    # by iterating row then col.\n    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                continue\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                neighbors.append(((nr, nc), (dr, dc)))\n    # Sort neighbors for consistent tie-breaking: row, then column\n    neighbors.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0][0], x[0][1]))\n    return neighbors\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the path-drawing transformation based on blue and magenta pixels,\n    including cycle detection for path generation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
