Identify all blue pixels (color 1) as sources and magenta pixels (color 6) as potential destinations.\n2. Determine the background color: the most frequent color in the input grid, excluding blue (1) and magenta (6). If no such color exists (e.g., grid only contains blue/magenta), default to white (0).\n3. If magenta pixels exist, they are the destinations. If not, the blue pixels themselves become the destinations for each other (excluding a pixel being its own destination).\n4. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n5. For every unique pair of a source pixel and a destination pixel:\n    a. If the source and destination are the same pixel, skip this pair.\n    b. Determine the color for this path: it's the color of the destination pixel.\n    c. Calculate a path from the source towards the destination.\n    d. The path progresses one step at a time to an adjacent pixel (including diagonals).\n    e. At each step, choose the adjacent pixel that minimizes the Manhattan distance to the destination.\n    f. If multiple adjacent pixels have the same minimum distance, prioritize diagonal moves (where both row and column change) over axial moves (where only row or column changes).\n    g. If there's still a tie among diagonal or among axial moves, prioritize the move with the smaller row index, and then the smaller column index.\n    h. The path calculation stops *before* reaching the destination pixel itself.\n    i. For each pixel position along the calculated path (excluding the source pixel): if its current color in the *output grid* is the background color, change its color in the *output grid* to the path color determined in step 5b. This allows paths drawn earlier to potentially block subsequent paths.\n6. Return the final modified output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef get_neighbors(r, c, height, width):\n    \"\"\"Gets valid 8-directional neighbors for a given coordinate.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains:\n              ((neighbor_row, neighbor_col), (delta_row, delta_col)).\n    \"\"\"\n    neighbors = []\n    # Order matters for tie-breaking: check smaller row/col first\n    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                continue\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                neighbors.append(((nr, nc), (dr, dc)))\n    # Sort neighbors for consistent tie-breaking: row, then column\n    neighbors.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0][0], x[0][1]))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef manhattan_distance(p1, p2):\n    \"\"\"Calculates Manhattan distance between two points (tuples).\"\"\"\n    return abs(p1[0] - p2[0]) + abs(p1[1] - p2[1])\n\ndef find_pixels(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds all coordinates (row, col) of pixels with a specific color.\"\"\"\n    return list(zip(*np.where(grid == color)))\n\ndef get_background_color(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds the most common color excluding blue (1) and magenta (6).\"\"\"\n    counts = Counter(grid.flatten())\n    # Remove source and potential destination colors from candidates\n    if 1 in counts:\n        del counts[1]\n    if 6 in counts:\n        del counts[6]\n\n    if not counts:\n        # Fallback if only blue/magenta exist, or grid is empty\n        # Check if 0 exists, otherwise pick most frequent of remaining\n        # (though this case seems unlikely based on examples)\n        all_counts = Counter(grid.flatten())\n        if 0 in all_counts:\n             return 0 # Default to white if available\n        elif all_counts:\n             return all_counts.most_common(1)[0][0] # Most frequent overall\n        else:\n             return 0 # Default for empty grid\n\n    # Return the most frequent remaining color\n    return counts.most_common(1)[0][0]\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the path-drawing transformation based on blue and magenta pixels.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    height, width = input_grid.shape\n\n    # 1.
