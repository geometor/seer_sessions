In the output, the original blue points remain, and new blue points are added.\n    *   **Magenta (6):** Appear as distinct points in the input and remain unchanged in the output. Not present in all examples (e.g., train\\_5).\n    *   **Background Color:** The dominant color in the grid (e.g., gray 5, azure 8, yellow 4) remains unchanged.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves adding new blue pixels to the grid. These new blue pixels form paths or lines.\n4.  **Path Origin and Destination:** The paths appear to originate from the initial blue pixels.\n    *   If magenta pixels are present, the paths extend from each blue pixel towards each magenta pixel.\n    *   If no magenta pixels are present (like in train\\_5), the paths extend from each blue pixel towards every *other* blue pixel.\n5.  **Path Generation:**\n    *   The paths follow a sequence of steps, moving from one pixel to an adjacent one (including diagonals).\n    *   Each step seems chosen to minimize the Manhattan distance to the destination (magenta or other blue pixel).\n    *   Diagonal steps appear to be preferred when multiple steps offer the same minimal distance reduction.\n    *   The path stops just before reaching the destination pixel.\n6.  **Coloring Rule:** Only pixels that were originally the background color along the calculated path (excluding the start and end points) are changed to blue. Existing blue or magenta pixels are not overwritten.\n7.  **Multiple Paths:** The final output grid includes the union of all paths generated from all valid source-destination pairs.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify the locations of all blue pixels (color 1) and store them as `source_pixels`.\n3.  Identify the locations of all magenta pixels (color 6) and store them as `magenta_pixels`.\n4.  Determine the set of `destination_pixels`:\n    *   If `magenta_pixels` is not empty, `destination_pixels` is `magenta_pixels`.\n    *   If `magenta_pixels` is empty, `destination_pixels` is the set of all `source_pixels`.\n5.  Identify the background color from a non-source, non-destination pixel in the input grid (e.g., `input_grid[0, 0]` if it's not blue or magenta, otherwise find another).\n6.  Iterate through each `source_pixel` (sr, sc) in `source_pixels`.\n7.  Inside this loop, iterate through each `destination_pixel` (dr, dc) in `destination_pixels`.\n8.  If the `source_pixel` is the same as the `destination_pixel` (can happen when destinations are other blue pixels), skip to the next destination.\n9.  Calculate the path from the current `source_pixel` (sr, sc) to the current `destination_pixel` (dr, dc):\n    a.  Start at `current_pixel` = (sr, sc).\n    b.  While `current_pixel` is not equal to `destination_pixel`:\n        i.   Find all valid adjacent pixels (including diagonals) to `current_pixel`.\n        ii.  Calculate the Manhattan distance from each adjacent pixel to the `destination_pixel`.\n        iii. Find the minimum Manhattan distance among the adjacent pixels.\n        iv. Identify all adjacent pixels that achieve this minimum distance.\n        v.  Select the `next_pixel` from these minimum-distance candidates using a tie-breaking rule: prefer diagonal moves (change in both row and column) over axial moves (change in only row or only column). If there's still a tie (e.g., two diagonal moves), choose one consistently (e.g., prioritize smaller row index, then smaller column index).\n        vi. If the `next_pixel` is equal to the `destination_pixel`, break the path calculation loop (stop before reaching the destination).\n        vii. If the pixel at `next_pixel` coordinates in the *input* grid has the background color, change the color of the pixel at `next_pixel` in the *output* grid to blue (1).\n        viii.Update `current_pixel` to `next_pixel`.\n10. After iterating through all source-destination pairs, return the modified output grid."
