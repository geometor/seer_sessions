- task_type: drawing
- input_elements:
    - background: A grid filled mostly with a single color (variable across examples: gray=5, azure=8, yellow=4).
    - sources: One or more pixels with color blue (1).
    - destinations:
        - Primarily, one or more pixels with color magenta (6).
        - If no magenta pixels exist, other blue pixels act as destinations.
- output_elements:
    - background: Same as input background color and extent.
    - sources: Original blue pixels remain unchanged.
    - destinations: Original magenta pixels (if any) remain unchanged.
    - paths: New pixels with color blue (1) added along specific paths.
- relationships:
    - Each source (blue pixel) potentially draws a path towards each destination (magenta or other blue pixel).
    - Paths consist of sequences of adjacent pixels (including diagonals).
- actions:
    - Identify all source (blue) and destination (magenta/blue) pixels.
    - For each source-destination pair:
        - Calculate the shortest path sequence based on minimizing Manhattan distance at each step.
        - Prioritize diagonal steps in case of ties in distance reduction.
        - Stop the path sequence one step before the destination pixel.
        - For each pixel in the calculated path (excluding source and destination):
            - Check if the pixel in the original input grid is the background color.
            - If yes, change this pixel's color to blue (1) in the output grid.
    - Combine all added blue pixels with the original input grid to form the final output.
