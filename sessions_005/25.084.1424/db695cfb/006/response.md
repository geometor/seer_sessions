## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided code attempts to draw paths between source (blue) and destination (magenta or other blue) pixels. However, it fails on all training examples, indicating significant flaws in the implemented logic compared to the underlying task rule.

**Key Discrepancies Observed:**

1.  **Path Color:** The code consistently uses the *destination* pixel's color (magenta or blue) for the path. Examples 1-4 clearly show paths colored with the *source* pixel's color (blue) in the expected output. Example 5 (blue-to-blue) uses blue, which matches the source color, but the path shape is slightly wrong.
2.  **Path Shape/Extent:** The generated paths often differ significantly in shape and length from the expected paths. They appear too dense (Example 1, 4), incorrectly routed (Example 3), or slightly inaccurate near the end (Example 5). This suggests issues with the pathfinding algorithm (step selection, tie-breaking, termination condition) or how path pixels are chosen for coloring.
3.  **Path Termination:** The code stops calculating the path when `manhattan_distance(current_pos, end_pos) <= 1`. This might explain why paths sometimes stop short or don't precisely connect as expected. The final connection step might need explicit handling.
4.  **Pixel Coloring Rule:** The code colors any `background_color` pixel encountered along the path. This might be too aggressive if paths cross non-background pixels or if only specific points along the path should be colored.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Correct Path Color:** Modify the code to use the *source* pixel's color (blue, which is always 1 in these examples) when drawing the path.
2.  **Refine Pathfinding:**
    *   Re-evaluate the tie-breaking logic (diagonal vs. axial preference). Analyze specific failing steps in the examples.
    *   Review the termination condition. Should the path calculation continue until the `current_pos` *is* the `end_pos`? Or should it stop just before, and perhaps draw a final connecting segment?
    *   Consider if the path should only consist of the single pixel chosen at each step, rather than potentially filling areas.
3.  **Analyze Pixel Coloring:** Check if paths overwrite existing non-background colors in the expected outputs. The current logic only colors background pixels; confirm if this is correct.
4.  **Gather Detailed Metrics:** Use code execution to pinpoint exact pixel differences and analyze the path steps taken by the current code versus what seems required by the expected output.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's analyze each example to confirm properties and differences.
