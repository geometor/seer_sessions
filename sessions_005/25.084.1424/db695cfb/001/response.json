If magenta pixels exist, they are the destinations. If not, the blue pixels themselves become the destinations for each other.\n3. For every unique pair of a source pixel and a destination pixel:\n    a. Calculate a path from the source towards the destination.\n    b. The path progresses one step at a time to an adjacent pixel (including diagonals).\n    c. At each step, choose the adjacent pixel that minimizes the Manhattan distance to the destination.\n    d. If multiple adjacent pixels have the same minimum distance, prioritize diagonal moves over axial moves. If there's still a tie (e.g., two diagonal moves), prioritize the move with the smaller row index, and then the smaller column index.\n    e. The path stops *before* reaching the destination pixel itself.\n    f. For each pixel along the calculated path (excluding the source and destination): if its original color in the input grid was the background color, change its color to blue (1) in the output grid.\n4. The final output grid contains the original blue and magenta pixels, the original background pixels, and the newly added blue pixels along the calculated paths.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef get_neighbors(r, c, height, width):\n    \"\"\"Gets valid 8-directional neighbors for a given coordinate.\"\"\"\n    neighbors = []\n    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                continue\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                neighbors.append(((nr, nc), (dr, dc))) # Store position and move delta\n    return neighbors\n\ndef manhattan_distance(p1, p2):\n    \"\"\"Calculates Manhattan distance between two points.\"\"\"\n    return abs(p1[0] - p2[0]) + abs(p1[1] - p2[1])\n\ndef find_pixels(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds all coordinates of pixels with a specific color.\"\"\"\n    return list(zip(*np.where(grid == color)))\n\ndef get_background_color(grid, source_coords, dest_coords):\n    \"\"\"Finds the most common color excluding source and destination colors.\"\"\"\n    potential_bgs = []\n    source_dest_colors = {1, 6} # Blue and Magenta\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r, c] not in source_dest_colors:\n                return grid[r, c] # Assume first non-source/dest is background\n    # Fallback (shouldn't be needed based on examples)\n    counts = np.bincount(grid.flatten())\n    if len(counts) > 0:\n        return np.argmax(counts)\n    return 0 # Default to white if grid is empty?\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the path-drawing transformation based on blue and magenta pixels.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    height, width = input_grid.shape\n\n    # 1.
