            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempted a transformation based on observations from a single example, assuming a pattern extraction followed by placement of four transformed versions (original, 90\u00b0 CW, 90\u00b0 CCW, 180\u00b0) into the corners of the output grid, leaving the original pattern area blank.\n\nThe results show this assumption is incorrect. The transformed outputs do not match the expected outputs for any of the three examples. The key discrepancies lie in:\n\n1.  **Placement:** The transformed patterns are not simply placed aligned with the grid corners.\n2.  **Overlap/Interaction:** The expected outputs show that the placed patterns overlap and overwrite each other, and also overwrite the original pattern area, rather than leaving it blank.\n3.  **Alignment Point:** The alignment seems related to the corners of the *bounding box* of the original pattern in the input grid, not the corners of the grid itself.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the understanding of the placement logic by analyzing the relationship between the input pattern's bounding box corners and the placement of the transformed patterns in the output. The hypothesis is that the *center* of each transformed pattern is aligned with one of the *corners* of the original pattern's bounding box.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's analyze each example to confirm the pattern, bounding box, and test the placement hypothesis.\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Grid: 18x18, Background: azure (8)\n*   Output Grid: 18x18, Background: azure (8)\n*   Non-background pixels form a single connected object.\n"

Record its corner coordinates: top-left `(min_r, min_c)`, top-right `(min_r, max_c)`, bottom-left `(max_r, min_c)`, and bottom-right `(max_r, max_c)`. If no non-background pixels are found, return the background-filled output grid.\n5.  **Extract Pattern:** Extract the subgrid defined by the bounding box from the input grid. This is the `pattern (P)`. Let its height be `pH` and width be `pW`.\n6.  **Calculate Pattern Center:** Determine the coordinates of the center pixel of the `pattern (P)` relative to its own top-left corner: `center_r = (pH - 1) // 2`, `center_c = (pW - 1) // 2`.\n7.  **Transform Pattern:** Create four versions of the `pattern (P)`:\n    *   `P_rot90_cw`: Rotate `P` 90 degrees clockwise.\n    *   `P_rot90_ccw`: Rotate `P` 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n    *   `P_rot180`: Rotate `P` 180 degrees.\n    *   `P_original`: The original `pattern (P)`.\n    *(Note: For square patterns, the center remains conceptually the same relative index after rotation. If patterns could be non-square, recalculate center for each rotated version if dimensions change.)*\n8.  **Calculate Placement Origins:** Determine the top-left starting coordinates for placing each transformed pattern onto the output grid:\n    *   For `P_rot90_cw`: `target_r = min_r - center_r`, `target_c = min_c - center_c`\n    *   For `P_rot90_ccw`: `target_r = min_r - center_r`, `target_c = max_c - center_c`\n    *   For `P_rot180`: `target_r = max_r - center_r`, `target_c = min_c - center_c`\n    *   For `P_original`: `target_r = max_r - center_r`, `target_c = max_c - center_c`\n9.  **Place Transformed Patterns:** Place each transformed pattern onto the output grid, starting at its calculated `(target_r, target_c)`.\n    *   When placing, if any part of the pattern falls outside the grid boundaries (due to negative or large coordinates), clip the pattern so only the overlapping part is drawn.\n    *   Pixels in the output grid are overwritten by the pixels of the placed patterns. Place the patterns in a consistent order (e.g., `P_rot90_cw`, then `P_rot90_ccw`, then `P_rot180`, then `P_original`).\n10. **Return Output:** The final modified output grid is the result."
