## General Assessment

The provided code attempted a transformation based on observations from a single example, assuming a pattern extraction followed by placement of four transformed versions (original, 90° CW, 90° CCW, 180°) into the corners of the output grid, leaving the original pattern area blank.

The results show this assumption is incorrect. The transformed outputs do not match the expected outputs for any of the three examples. The key discrepancies lie in:

1.  **Placement:** The transformed patterns are not simply placed aligned with the grid corners.
2.  **Overlap/Interaction:** The expected outputs show that the placed patterns overlap and overwrite each other, and also overwrite the original pattern area, rather than leaving it blank.
3.  **Alignment Point:** The alignment seems related to the corners of the *bounding box* of the original pattern in the input grid, not the corners of the grid itself.

The strategy is to refine the understanding of the placement logic by analyzing the relationship between the input pattern's bounding box corners and the placement of the transformed patterns in the output. The hypothesis is that the *center* of each transformed pattern is aligned with one of the *corners* of the original pattern's bounding box.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's analyze each example to confirm the pattern, bounding box, and test the placement hypothesis.

**Example 1:**
*   Input Grid: 18x18, Background: azure (8)
*   Output Grid: 18x18, Background: azure (8)
*   Non-background pixels form a single connected object.

def find_pattern_bbox(grid, bg_color):
    non_bg_pixels = np.where(grid != bg_color)
    if len(non_bg_pixels[0]) == 0: return None
    min_r, max_r = np.min(non_bg_pixels[0]), np.max(non_bg_pixels[0])
    min_c, max_c = np.min(non_bg_pixels[1]), np.max(non_bg_pixels[1])
    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c

def extract_pattern(grid, bbox):
   if bbox is None: return np.array([[]])
   min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = bbox
   return grid[min_r:max_r+1, min_c:max_c+1]

**Observations from Metrics:**

*   All examples feature a single central pattern on a uniform background (azure - 8).
*   The pattern in all examples is 9x9.
*   The bounding box corners are correctly identified.
*   The relative center of the 9x9 pattern is correctly calculated as (4, 4).

**Placement Hypothesis Verification:**

Let's calculate the target top-left placement coordinates (`target_r = corner_r - pattern_center_r`, `target_c = corner_c - pattern_center_c`) for each example and transformed pattern:

*   **Example 1 (Pattern Center: 4, 4):**
    *   P_rot90_cw (center 4,4) -> BBox corner (3, 3) -> Placement (3-4, 3-4) = **(-1, -1)**
    *   P_rot90_ccw (center 4,4) -> BBox corner (3, 11) -> Placement (3-4, 11-4) = **(-1, 7)**
    *   P_rot180 (center 4,4) -> BBox corner (11, 3) -> Placement (11-4, 3-4) = **(7, -1)**
    *   P_original (center 4,4) -> BBox corner (11, 11) -> Placement (11-4, 11-4) = **(7, 7)**
*   **Example 2 (Pattern Center: 4, 4):**
    *   P_rot90_cw (center 4,4) -> BBox corner (4, 3) -> Placement (4-4, 3-4) = **(0, -1)**
    *   P_rot90_ccw (center 4,4) -> BBox corner (4, 11) -> Placement (4-4, 11-4) = **(0, 7)**
    *   P_rot180 (center 4,4) -> BBox corner (12, 3) -> Placement (12-4, 3-4) = **(8, -1)**
    *   P_original (center 4,4) -> BBox corner (12, 11) -> Placement (12-4, 11-4) = **(8, 7)**
*   **Example 3 (Pattern Center: 4, 4):**
    *   P_rot90_cw (center 4,4) -> BBox corner (5, 6) -> Placement (5-4, 6-4) = **(1, 2)**
    *   P_rot90_ccw (center 4,4) -> BBox corner (5, 14) -> Placement (5-4, 14-4) = **(1, 10)**
    *   P_rot180 (center 4,4) -> BBox corner (13, 6) -> Placement (13-4, 6-4) = **(9, 2)**
    *   P_original (center 4,4) -> BBox corner (13, 14) -> Placement (13-4, 14-4) = **(9, 10)**

These calculated placement coordinates, combined with appropriate clipping for negative indices, appear consistent with the structure observed in the expected output grids. The transformed patterns overlap significantly.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: >
  Transforms an input grid containing a single central pattern on a uniform background.
  The transformation involves extracting the pattern, creating four transformed versions
  (original, rotated 90 degrees clockwise, rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise, rotated 180 degrees),
  and placing them onto an output grid of the same size, initially filled with the background color.
  The placement is determined by aligning the center of each transformed pattern with a corner
  of the bounding box of the original pattern in the input grid. Overlapping pixels are overwritten,
  with later placements taking precedence.

input_properties:
  - grid_dimensionality: 2D
  - grid_size: Variable (e.g., 18x18, 16x16, 19x19)
  - pixel_colors: 0-9 integer range
  - background: Uniform color, determined from the top-left pixel (azure/8 in examples).
  - objects:
      - name: background
        count: 1
        pixels: Contiguous area covering most of the grid.
      - name: central_pattern
        count: 1
        pixels: Single contiguous block of non-background colors located near the center.
        shape: Square (9x9 in examples).
        location: Defined by a bounding box (BBox).

output_properties:
  - grid_dimensionality: 2D
  - grid_size: Same as input grid size.
  - pixel_colors: Same range as input, using colors from the background and the pattern.
  - background: Initially fills the grid, but may be largely overwritten.
  - objects:
      - name: placed_patterns
        count: 4
        description: >
          Four overlapping copies derived from the input central_pattern.
          The copies correspond to specific geometric transformations applied to the central_pattern.
        transformations:
          - Original (identity)
          - Rotation 90 degrees clockwise (CW)
          - Rotation 90 degrees counter-clockwise (CCW)
          - Rotation 180 degrees
        placement_rule: >
          Each transformed pattern is placed such that its calculated center pixel aligns
          with one of the four corner pixels of the *bounding box* of the original central_pattern
          in the input grid.
        placement_mapping:
          - Transformed Pattern: Rotated 90 CW
            Alignment BBox Corner: Top-Left (min_r, min_c)
          - Transformed Pattern: Rotated 90 CCW
            Alignment BBox Corner: Top-Right (min_r, max_c)
          - Transformed Pattern: Rotated 180
            Alignment BBox Corner: Bottom-Left (max_r, min_c)
          - Transformed Pattern: Original
            Alignment BBox Corner: Bottom-Right (max_r, max_c)
        overlap_handling: Overwrite. The order of placement might matter if transparency were involved, but here, simple overwrite seems sufficient. A consistent order (e.g., CW, CCW, 180, Original) should be used.

constants:
  - Rotations: [CW 90 (-1), CCW 90 (1), 180 (2), Original (0)] corresponding to numpy `rot90` k values.

derived_values:
  - pattern_bbox: Coordinates (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) of the central_pattern.
  - bbox_corners: Four coordinate pairs [(min_r, min_c), (min_r, max_c), (max_r, min_c), (max_r, max_c)].
  - pattern_center: Relative coordinates ((pH-1)//2, (pW-1)//2) within the extracted pattern P.
  - placement_origins: Four coordinate pairs calculated as (corner_coord - pattern_center_coord) for each transformed pattern and corresponding BBox corner. These are the top-left coordinates for placing each pattern on the output grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  **Identify Background:** Determine the background color by checking the color of the pixel at the top-left corner (0, 0) of the input grid.
3.  **Fill Background:** Fill the entire output grid with the identified background color.
4.  **Find Pattern Bounding Box:** Locate the smallest rectangular bounding box that encloses all non-background pixels in the input grid. Record its corner coordinates: top-left `(min_r, min_c)`, top-right `(min_r, max_c)`, bottom-left `(max_r, min_c)`, and bottom-right `(max_r, max_c)`. If no non-background pixels are found, return the background-filled output grid.
5.  **Extract Pattern:** Extract the subgrid defined by the bounding box from the input grid. This is the `pattern (P)`. Let its height be `pH` and width be `pW`.
6.  **Calculate Pattern Center:** Determine the coordinates of the center pixel of the `pattern (P)` relative to its own top-left corner: `center_r = (pH - 1) // 2`, `center_c = (pW - 1) // 2`.
7.  **Transform Pattern:** Create four versions of the `pattern (P)`:
    *   `P_rot90_cw`: Rotate `P` 90 degrees clockwise.
    *   `P_rot90_ccw`: Rotate `P` 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
    *   `P_rot180`: Rotate `P` 180 degrees.
    *   `P_original`: The original `pattern (P)`.
    *(Note: For square patterns, the center remains conceptually the same relative index after rotation. If patterns could be non-square, recalculate center for each rotated version if dimensions change.)*
8.  **Calculate Placement Origins:** Determine the top-left starting coordinates for placing each transformed pattern onto the output grid:
    *   For `P_rot90_cw`: `target_r = min_r - center_r`, `target_c = min_c - center_c`
    *   For `P_rot90_ccw`: `target_r = min_r - center_r`, `target_c = max_c - center_c`
    *   For `P_rot180`: `target_r = max_r - center_r`, `target_c = min_c - center_c`
    *   For `P_original`: `target_r = max_r - center_r`, `target_c = max_c - center_c`
9.  **Place Transformed Patterns:** Place each transformed pattern onto the output grid, starting at its calculated `(target_r, target_c)`.
    *   When placing, if any part of the pattern falls outside the grid boundaries (due to negative or large coordinates), clip the pattern so only the overlapping part is drawn.
    *   Pixels in the output grid are overwritten by the pixels of the placed patterns. Place the patterns in a consistent order (e.g., `P_rot90_cw`, then `P_rot90_ccw`, then `P_rot180`, then `P_original`).
10. **Return Output:** The final modified output grid is the result.
