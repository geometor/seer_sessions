  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - width: variable
      - height: variable
      - cells: digits (0-9) representing colors

  - name: subgrid_objects
    type: grid_selection # a selection or subset of the input_grid
    properties:
     - color(s): a subset of colors that identify subgrids
     - location: variable
     - potential_transformations: [reordering, inversion, cropping]

actions:
  - name: identify_subgrids
    description: Find contiguous blocks of the same color in the lower-right portion of input grid.
    input: input_grid
    output: set of subgrid_objects

  - name: extract_subgrids
    description: Creates a new grid from the identified subgrids.
    input: set of subgrid_objects, input_grid
    output: output_grid

  - name: reorder_subgrids
    description: changes pixel ordering within or between subgrids.
    input: set of subgrid objects
    output: reordered set of subgrid_objects

  - name: invert_subgrids
    description: potentially changes color ordering or direction of pixels, within or between subgrids
    input: set of subgrid objects
    output: inverted ordering of subgrid objects or pixels

relations:
  - relation: output_derived_from_input
    description: The output_grid is created by selecting, potentially reordering, and extracting parts of the input_grid.
  - relation: subgrids_defined_by_color
    description: contiguous pixels of a single color can define a region in the input grid.
  - relation: location_matters
    description: the relative position, specifically in the lower right part of the grids is an important feature
