"""
1. **Identify Target Area:** Focus on the lower-right quadrant or section of the input grid. This is the source for constructing the output.
2. **Identify Objects:** The colored pixel groups in lower-right are the key objects.
3. **Object Extraction:** Select these objects in the lower right.
4. **Reordering and Inversion (Conditional):** Reverse the order of the *columns* of objects AND/OR within each object, reverse the color order horizontally.  This step is key and needs careful observation across examples. It's either row-wise or column-wise reordering, possibly both, combined with a possible horizontal flip.
5. **Cropping (If Necessary):** If a rectangular selection results in a grid that is smaller than a repeating section within the input, create the output grid by taking the subgrid.
6. **Output Construction:** The extracted, reordered (and possibly inverted and cropped) section becomes the output grid.
