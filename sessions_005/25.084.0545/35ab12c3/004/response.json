            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis of \"flood-fill expansion into existing non-zero colors\" is not entirely correct. The code expands all objects uniformly in all directions, overwriting any existing colors. This works for *some* parts of some examples, but drastically fails to capture the nuances of the transformations. Specifically, the expansion is not a simple flood fill, and the boundaries and interactions between the colors are not as simple as assumed. The generated output becomes a single color, failing to capture the expected output. The key issue lies in how colors are chosen.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze *all* provided examples again, paying very close attention to the *edges* of the expanded regions. Note *which* colors expand and *where* they stop expanding.\n2.  **Refine Object Identification:** The existing `find_objects` function seems adequate for identifying contiguous regions of the same color.\n3.  **Develop a Precise Expansion Rule:** The core problem is the `expand_object` function and the general approach to expansion. Instead of a simple outward expansion, we need a rule that considers:\n    *   The original color of the object being expanded.\n    *   The colors of neighboring pixels.\n    *   Some form of interaction or boundary condition.\n4. **Prioritize boundary conditions** Try to determine what stops expansion and what is the result of interaction.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Facts (using manual analysis, since no shared variable for code execution):**\n\nI will manually check for connectivity of initial objects\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   Input: Multiple disconnected objects of colors 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8.\n*   Expected Output: Objects have expanded, sometimes merging, with clear boundaries. Some objects have inner sections.\n*   Actual Output: The entire grid is filled with color 4.\n*   Observations:\n    *   The magenta (6) object near the top expands and merges with the orange (7). The resulting shape has straight borders.\n    *   The green (3) objects at left expand, but are blocked.\n    *   The single 4 at the bottom expands to engulf a horizontal area near it.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   Input: Multiple disconnected objects of colors 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8.\n*   Expected Output: Similar expansion and merging behavior as Example 1.\n*   Actual Output: The entire grid is filled with color 3.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   Input: Disconnected objects of colors 1, 2, 4, 7, and 8.\n*   Expected Output: Expansion and merging with defined boundaries.\n*   Actual Output: The entire grid filled with color 2.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

An object is a group of connected pixels of the same color (excluding black/0, which is considered background).\n2.  **Iterate and Expand:** Iterate through each identified object.\n3. **Expansion process:**\n    *   The non-zero colors expand into neighboring areas, including black/0 background.\n    *   The objects appear to expand one layer at a time, respecting a precedence or rule when colors meet. This interaction rule between color is the current missing link. It's NOT simply \"overwrite\".\n    * The final expansion appear to have horizontal and vertical lines - not diagonal.\n    * Look for specific pairwise interaction rules.\n\nThe core challenge now is to find out how colors overwrite or block other\ncolors. It seems that expansion might \"stop\" at an edge. The current\nimplementation of expansion fills the entire grid because it doesn't\nincorporate any of this interaction.\n\nWe can determine that the expansion is very specific to its surroundings. It\nis *not* flood-fill - it has stopping conditions, likely based on horizontal\nand vertical adjacency, and likely based on the combination of which color it is\nexpanding and which color it is hitting.\n"
