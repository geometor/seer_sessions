Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming 2D grids of colored pixels.  The input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example, but the pixel colors and their arrangements change. There appear to be multiple objects within each grid, identifiable by their distinct colors and shapes. Some colors are expanded, some stay the same, and some change their position. The background color (0/white) seems to act as a passive element, filled in by the expansion of other colors.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - objects: |
      Objects are contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color.
  - object_properties: |
      color: Integer value (0-9) representing a color.
      shape: The arrangement of pixels forming the object. Can be a single pixel, line, rectangle, or irregular shape.
      position: Location of the object in the grid, definable by row and column indices.
  - actions: |
      expansion: Objects of certain colors expand outwards, either horizontally, vertically, or both.
      filling: The expansion fills in areas of the background color (0/white).
      color_change: In some instances an object might change its color and the surrounding object colors as well.
      copy: An object might maintain its color/shape in output.
  - relationships: |
      adjacency: Objects interact based on their proximity to each other. Expansion seems to occur until a non-background color is encountered.
      containment: The background (0/white) can be considered a container for all other objects.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid and identify all distinct objects. An object is defined as one or more adjacent pixels of the same color.

2.  **Expansion and Copy:**
    *   Iterate through the distinct colors, excluding white/background (0).

    * There appears to be object expansion in the following way:
        * An object, o, is identified.
        * Search the output grid, from top-left, for an expanded version of the object, eo.
        * The object, eo is an expansion of o where:
           * Each pixel in o has been copied to the corresponding pixel in eo.
           * Surrounding each pixel in eo is either another pixel of the object color, or any color other than white.
    * If an object does not follow this rule, it is copied.

3.  **Background:** The remaining white (0) pixels in the output grid remain unchanged.

In summary, the program identifies the objects, then selectively expands them, and copies the rest. The background is implicitly handled by not being expanded. The key is figuring out the expansion for each of the input colors.
