Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy to improve the natural language program and the subsequent code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a simple expansion of all non-zero colored objects outwards until a non-zero color is met. The results clearly show this is not the complete rule, as evidenced by the mismatches in all three examples. The expansion logic is too aggressive and doesn't account for the selective and directional nature of the actual transformation. It seems like objects expand into some non-zero neighbors as well.

The core issue is that the code expands *all* objects uniformly, whereas the examples demonstrate a more nuanced rule, involving a flood fill from certain parts of the grid.

Strategy:

1. **Detailed Example Analysis:** Analyze each input-output pair to identify specific patterns, including:
   - Which objects expand and which don't.
   - The starting point and direction of expansion/flood fill.
   - The conditions under which expansion stops (colors, adjacency).
   - What determines output color.

2. **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the detailed analysis, create a new, more precise natural language program that captures the *complete* transformation logic, rather than just the simple expansion seen in the first example.

3. **Hypothesis and Test:** Use the updated understanding to revise the code. The revised code should reflect a more complex flood-fill.

**Gather Metrics and Example Reports (via code execution)**
