1. Identify Objects: Find all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a
   group of connected pixels of the same color (excluding black/0, which is
   considered background).
2. Iterate and Expand: Iterate through each identified object.
3. Expansion process:
    *  The non-zero colors expand into neighboring areas, including black/0
       background.
    * The objects appear to expand one layer at a time, respecting a precedence
      or rule when colors meet. This interaction rule between color is the
      current missing link. It's NOT simply "overwrite".
    * The final expansion appear to have horizontal and vertical lines - not
      diagonal.
    * Look for specific pairwise interaction rules.
