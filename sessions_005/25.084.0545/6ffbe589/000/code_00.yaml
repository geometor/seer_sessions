task_description: |
  The task involves transforming an input grid of colored pixels into a smaller output grid.
  The transformation extracts and rearranges colored objects from the input.

facts:
  - object_types:
    - background:
        color: 0  # White
    - colored_object:
        colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  # All non-zero colors
        description: Contiguous block of pixels of the same non-zero color.

  - properties:
    - color:
        type: integer
        range: [0, 9]
    - shape:
        type: irregular
        description: Determined by the arrangement of contiguous pixels.
    - size:
        type: integer
        description: Number of pixels in the object.
    - position:
        type: coordinates
        description: Location of the object within the grid.

  - actions:
    - extraction:
        description: Selecting colored objects from the input grid.
    - rearrangement:
        description: Placing the extracted objects into the output grid.
    - cropping:
        description: Reducing the size of the grid.

  - relationships:
      - adjacency:
          description: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share a side or a corner.
      - containment:
          description: Objects are contained within the grid boundaries.
      - relative_position: objects position may have some effect on transformation
