            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for updating the natural language program and code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program focused on a simple \"crop to non-zero\" strategy. This works for finding a bounding box around all non-zero pixels, but it doesn't accurately capture the nuances of the transformations in all examples, especially example 1. The outputs are generally larger than and misaligned compared to the expected outputs, but the main issue is a consistent offset and extra rows/columns.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Misalignment:** Determine the consistent patterns. It seems like the code is including extra rows and columns of zeros, and the positioning isn't consistent.\n2.  **Refine Bounding Box Logic:** The current `get_bounding_box` function finds *any* non-zero element. This is too broad. It looks like the examples want a tight cropping, where empty rows/columns *within* the object are also considered. This means we want the smallest rectangular region enclosing *all* non-zeroes, and in the context of ARC problems, this would be a \"bounding box\". We must maintain all the original relative positions of the input grid to the output grid.\n3.  **Object Identification:** We will define \"objects\" by contiguous sections of non-zero pixels.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection and deduction):**\n\nI can't directly execute code here to generate detailed metrics. However, I can make observations based on the provided input/output/transformed output:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 20x20\n    *   Expected Output Size: 13x13\n    *   Transformed Output Size: 19x18\n    *   Observation: The transformed output almost includes the complete shape described by non-zero pixels but is not cropped correctly. The expected output has a top offset of 1, a left offset of 3, a bottom offset of 6 and a right offset of 0. The transformed version has incorrect offsets.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 20x20\n    *   Expected Output Size: 10x10\n    *   Transformed Output Size: 15x14\n    *   Observation: Similar to Example 1, the transformed output contains extra rows and columns. The expected output has a consistent offset.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Size: 20x20\n    *   Expected Output Size: 10x10\n    *   Transformed Output Size: 17x14\n    *   Observation: Again, extra rows and columns.\n\n**YAML Fact Representation:**\n\n"
