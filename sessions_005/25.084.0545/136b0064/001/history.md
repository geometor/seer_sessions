Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grids appear to contain vertical stripes of various colors, with a consistent pattern: a color, then a black (0) column, then the same color again, then a black column.  A consistent element in all inputs is a vertical stripe of yellow (4) near the middle, but it's *not* copied to the output. The output grid seems to extract and rearrange specific colored objects, often reducing their size and changing arrangement. Some colors in output combine together and some are ignored. The spatial relationships between objects in the input do *not* seem to be strictly preserved in the output.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Input grids have vertical stripes of color, alternating with columns of black (0).
  - observation: Input grids share the feature of single yellow (4) stripe, and yellow is not present in the output.
  - observation: Output grids are composed of colored objects from the input, but in different arrangements and often smaller sizes.
  - observation: Only certain colored objects in the input appear to be selected, while other pixels are discarded.
  - observation: The selected color is maintained from input to output, but other non selected colors appear.
  - action: Copy selected objects from the input, reducing in size and rearranging them.
  - action: Discard the yellow stripe, and other parts of the input.
  - relationship: Output grid dimensions are smaller and derived from the input, but the relationship is not a simple crop.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Objects:** Examine the input grid and identify the non-yellow colored objects, these stripes will appear in the output. Ignore all the yellow (4) colored pixels and the single pixel wide black (0) colored columns.
2.  **Extract and Transform:** For each distinct vertical colored stripe (other than yellow and black), extract it. Condense each selected color stripe vertically by counting and changing the size.
3.  **Construct Output:** Create a new, smaller output grid. Place the transformed/condensed stripes in a new arrangement, potentially adjusting their vertical position and combining some of the original objects:
    *   In example 1, gray (5) is at \[0, 9] and goes to output \[0,1].
    *   red (2) is at \[0,0], \[0,2] and goes to output \[1,0], \[1,1]
    *   blue (1) goes to output \[2,0], \[2,1], \[2,2] and \[3,2], \[3,3], \[3,4]
    *   magenta (6) goes to \[4,4], \[5,4], \[6,4], \[7,4] and \[8,1], \[8,2], \[8,3], \[8,4]
    *   green (3) goes to \[9,1], \[9,2], \[9,3], \[9,4]
4. **Discard:** The yellow stripe and single width black areas are not copied to the output.

In summary, the transformation identifies specific colored objects, transforms their shape (reducing length), and places them into a smaller output grid in a new specific order and layout, discarding all yellow and single-width black areas. The key is selecting which stripes appear, and which are discarded.
