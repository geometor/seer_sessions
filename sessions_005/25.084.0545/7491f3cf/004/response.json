            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a simple line extension rule. However, the test results clearly show that this rule is insufficient to explain all the transformations. The code extends lines horizontally and vertically, but it only extends *past* a single different colored pixel. The expected outputs demonstrate a more complex \"fill\" behavior, where a line extends until it hits a pixel of a *different* color that *isn't* part of the line, or the grid boundary. In effect, lines of the same color identify pixels of different colors and \"paint\" over them, but only in one direction (either horizontal or vertical).\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine the \"extension\" logic:** The current logic only overwrites one different neighbor. The updated logic should continue extending the line until a boundary or a different, non-overwritable color is encountered.\n2. **Clarify Directionality**: It is essential to make a distinction between the line and the object it is impacting.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Analysis:**\n\nLet's analyze each example to pinpoint the discrepancies. I'll focus on describing *why* the current code fails and how the expected output differs.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Has horizontal and vertical lines of various colors.\n    *   **Expected Output:** Horizontal and vertical lines have extended, overwriting adjacent pixels of different colors.\n        For example, the sequence `5 6 4 4 4 6 5` becomes `5 6 4 4 4 4 4`. The fours extend, overwriting the 6.\n        Also,  `5 2 4 4 4 2 5` becomes `5 2 4 4 4 2 5`\n    *   **Current Output:** The lines only extend one pixel in any case where the succeeding pixel is a different color.\n    *   **Discrepancy:** The extension logic is too limited.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Similar to example 1.\n    *   **Expected Output:** Same line extension pattern.\n       `1 8 8 4 8 8 1` becomes `1 8 8 4 8 8 1`\n       `1 2 8 8 8 2 1` becomes `1 2 8 8 8 2 1`\n    *   **Current Output:**  One-pixel extensions\n    *   **Discrepancy:** Same as Example 1.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    Similar to example 1 & 2\n\n* **Example 4**\n    Similar\n\n**YAML Fact Extraction:**\n\n"

A line is defined as a sequence of two or more adjacent pixels of the same color.\n2.  **Horizontal Extension:** For each horizontal line, extend the line to the right. The extension continues until either the edge of the grid is reached or a pixel is encountered that has a different color *and* is not part of a horizontal line that could overwrite.\n3.  **Vertical Extension:** For each vertical line, extend the line downward. The extension continues until either the edge of the grid is reached, or a pixel is encountered that has a different color *and* is not part of a vertical line that could overwrite.\n4.  **Overwrite:** When a line is extended, the color of the line overwrites the color of any pixels encountered during the extension, provided they are part of a line of that direction..\n\nThe key refinement here is the condition for stopping the extension. It's not just encountering *any* different color, but encountering a different color that isn't part of an extendable line.\n"
