observations:
  - task_id: "f2a7282c"
  - example_set: train
  - object_types:
      - type: line
        properties:
          - color: integer (0-9)
          - orientation: horizontal or vertical
          - length: integer (>= 2) #a line must be 2 or more connected pixels
          - start_position: (row, col)
  - actions:
      - name: extend_line
        description: Extends a line in its orientation until a boundary or a different, non-extendable color is encountered.
        preconditions:
          - "Line must be correctly identified (start, color, orientation)."
        postconditions:
          - "Pixels along the extension path are overwritten with the line's color, *unless* the target pixel is part of another extendable line."
  - error_types:
      - type: overextension
        description: Lines extend beyond their valid stopping point.
        cause: Incorrect conditional check during extension, overwrites pixels that belong to other potential lines.
      - type: incorrect_start
        description: single pixel is incorrectly identified as the start of a line
