            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code focused on extending lines of identical colors horizontally and vertically. However, the test results reveal a significant flaw: the extension logic overwrites *any* neighboring pixel, regardless of whether it's part of an existing line of a different color. The expected outputs show that the extension should stop when it encounters a pixel of a different color that *isn't* part of a line that would itself be extended. The current implementation also has problems with lines that extend when they should not.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Line Detection:** Improve the `is_horizontal_line` and `is_vertical_line` functions to accurately identify the *start* of a line segment. A pixel is only the start of a horizontal/vertical line if the *preceding* pixel (left for horizontal, above for vertical) is of a *different* color.\n\n2.  **Conditional Overwriting:** Modify the extension logic. When extending a line, check if the target pixel is part of a line that should also be extended. *Only* overwrite if the target pixel's color is different and the target is *not* the start of another extendable line.\n\n3. **Address extraneous line extensions:** There are lines being extended from single pixels. Modify the is\\_horizontal\\_line and is\\_vertical\\_line checks to specifically check if the *next* pixel has the same color.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's analyze some metrics:\n\n*   **Consistent Error Pattern:** Across all examples, the transformed output shows excessive overwriting. The lines extend beyond where they should, overwriting colors they should not.\n*   **Example 1, Row 2, Column 2 Onward:**\u00a0The code extends '4' across the entire row and overwrites colors that should not change.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Lines:** Scan the input grid to identify horizontal and vertical lines. A line is defined as two or more adjacent pixels of the same color. A pixel is the *start* of a horizontal line if the pixel to its left is a different color and the pixel to its right has the same color. Similarly, a pixel is the *start* of a vertical line if the pixel above it is a different color and the pixel below it has the same color.\n\n2.  **Extend Lines:** For each identified line, extend it in its respective direction (right for horizontal, down for vertical).\n\n3.  **Conditional Overwrite:** During extension, overwrite the color of a pixel only if the following conditions are met.\n    *   The target pixel has a color that is different than the extending line\n    *   The target pixel is *not* the start of horizontal or vertical lines as described above.\n\n4. Stop the line if you reach the edge of the grid\n\n5.  **Repeat:** Continue this process until all identified lines have been extended.\n\nThe critical change here is the *conditional overwrite* based on whether the target pixel is also part of an extendable line, and the clarification that only line *starts* should initiate extension.\n"
