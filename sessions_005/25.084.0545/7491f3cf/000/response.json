The input and output grids have the same dimensions.  The most obvious change is related to isolated groups of digits, particularly \"fingers\" of numbers.  The transformation seems to selectively extend, or \"snake\", certain colored regions, specifically into groups of three in a line. The outer frame always stays in the same place.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
