            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a strategy to improve the transformation rule.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code are based on the idea of extending lines of three identical colors. However, the results on the training examples show significant discrepancies between the expected output and the transformed output. This indicates that the initial rule is too simplistic and doesn't fully capture the complexity of the transformation. The code extends lines in all directions where valid, which is clearly not correct. The expected output shows the lines extending only in one direction (right for horizontal lines and down for vertical lines), and it's not strictly about lines of *three*, it is about lines of any length.\n\nThe strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Detailed Metric Gathering:** Analyzing the examples to pinpoint exactly where and how the current rule fails. We'll look at the direction of extension, the length of lines, and boundary conditions.\n2.  **Refined Object and Action Identification:** Improve the description of objects, properties and actions in YAML format.\n3.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** Develop a new rule that captures those elements.\n\n**Metric Gathering using Code Execution:**\nFirst, let's define functions to obtain the expected output size, colors and their counts for both expected and obtained results, in order to reproduce the reported metrics, and add any other metric we find relevant.\n\n"
