    observations:
      - type: object_identification
        description: "Non-background pixels form objects."
        details: "Contiguous regions of the same non-background color are considered a single object."
      - type: background
        description: "The most frequent color in the input grid is the background."
        details: "Background pixels can be overwritten by object expansion."
      - type: expansion
        description: "Objects expand into adjacent background pixels."
        details: "Expansion occurs in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right)."
      - type: color_interaction
        description: "When two objects of different colors expand into the same background pixel, a specific color takes precedence."
        details: "Color 6 appears to overwrite color 1 in expansion conflicts."
      - type: shift
        description: "In some cases single object shifts vertically"
        details: "if there is one color and the count of starting pixels for that color is <= 2. shift the pixels of that object vertically upwards stopping when adjacent to another object, or reaching row 0."
      - type: boundaries
        description: expansion or shifting respects grid boundaries
        details: "expansion and shifting stops at edges of the grid."
