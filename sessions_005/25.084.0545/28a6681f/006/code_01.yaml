facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 2D array of color values.
    properties:
      - rows: Number of rows in the grid.
      - columns: Number of columns in the grid.
  - object: pixel
    description: A single cell within the grid.
    properties:
      - color: Integer value representing the color (0-9).
      - row_index: Vertical position in the grid.
      - col_index: Horizontal position in the grid.
  - object: segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color within a row.
    properties:
      - color: The color of all pixels in the segment.
      - start_col: Column index of the first pixel in the segment.
      - end_col: Column index of the last pixel in the segment.
      - row_index: The row where the segment appears
  - action: shift_left
    description: Moves a segment one position to the left.
    preconditions:
      - segment.start_col > 0  # Not at the leftmost edge.
      - left_adjacent_pixel.color != segment.color  # Left neighbor is different.
      - exists pixel to right with different color
    postconditions:
      - Pixels within segment have their col_index reduced by 1.
      - The pixel immediately to the right of the original segment's end position takes the segment's original end position
  - observation: boundary_preservation
    description: The top and bottom rows of the grid are unchanged.
