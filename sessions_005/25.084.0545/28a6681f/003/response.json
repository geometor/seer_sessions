If it is equal, skip to the next. However, examine the pixels to the right. If consecutive pixels share the same color and the sequence is followed by a different color, the entire segment with the same color *shifts* one position to the left, only if the cell to the left is of a different color and is *not* part of an unchanged row. The \"different color\" pixel on the right of the same-color sequence effectively acts as a boundary, blocking a shift beyond it.\n\n4. If a series of repeating colors extends until the last column, no shift is applied and it remains unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the observed rule.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Iterate through inner rows\n    for i in range(1, rows - 1):\n        j = 0\n        while j < cols:\n            # Find consecutive same-color segments\n            start = j\n            while j + 1 < cols and input_grid[i, j] == input_grid[i, j + 1]:\n                j += 1\n            end = j\n\n            # Check for a different color boundary on the right and available space to the left\n            if end + 1 < cols and start > 0 and input_grid[i, start-1] != input_grid[i,start]: # and input_grid[i, end] != input_grid[i,end+1]:\n                # Shift the segment to the left\n                for k in range(start, end + 1):\n                    output_grid[i, k - 1] = input_grid[i, k]\n                # Check if series reached the end before shift\n                if end+1 != cols:\n                  output_grid[i, end] = input_grid[i,end+1] # boundary color\n\n            j = end + 1  # Move to the next segment\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
