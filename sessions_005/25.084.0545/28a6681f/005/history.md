1.  **Preserve Boundaries:** The first (top) and last (bottom) rows of the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.

2.  **Inner Row Transformation:**  For each row from the second row to the second-to-last row:

3.  **Conditional Left Shift:** Starting from the leftmost pixel examine if its immediate right value. If it is equal, skip to the next. However, examine the pixels to the right. If consecutive pixels share the same color and the sequence is followed by a different color, the entire segment with the same color *shifts* one position to the left, only if the cell to the left is of a different color and is *not* part of an unchanged row. The "different color" pixel on the right of the same-color sequence effectively acts as a boundary, blocking a shift beyond it.

4. If a series of repeating colors extends until the last column, no shift is applied and it remains unchanged.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and the subsequent code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and code captured some aspects of the transformation, specifically the left-shifting of same-color segments. However, the results show significant discrepancies in all three examples, indicating flaws in the logic. The primary issues seem to be:

1.  **Incorrect Shifting:** The shifting logic isn't accurately handling all cases, particularly when multiple shifts might be applicable in a single row. It seems to prematurely stop after one shift.
2.  **Boundary Handling:** The conditions for applying the shift (checking neighboring colors) are not entirely correct. It is especially apparent in example 2 that the presence of 1's on the right should cause all 0's before it to move to the beginning of the row.
3. **Missing Zero Fill**: In the cases shown in the expected output, when the values shift, the right-most values take the shifted values' place.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Boundary Conditions:** Carefully analyze how different colors on *both* the left and right of a segment influence the shift. The current code only correctly shifts pixels when there is a different color to the left.
2.  **Iterative Shifting:** Ensure that after a shift occurs, the algorithm re-evaluates the shifted segment and its new neighbors for potential further shifts.
3.  **Zero-Filling/Replacement:** Ensure the logic includes filling the vacated positions correctly.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To better understand the patterns, let's use a tool to analyze the example where we remove the top and bottom rows, and then compare the changes that were made:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve Boundaries:** The top and bottom rows of the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.

2.  **Inner Row Transformation:** For each row from the second row to the second-to-last row:
    *   Iterate through the row from left to right.
    *   Identify contiguous segments of pixels with the same color.
    *   For each segment:
        * Check if there is space available to the left (the segment is *not* at the beginning of the row).
        * If the left adjacent pixel has different color AND there is at least one pixel with a different color to the right of the segment:
        *   Shift every pixel within the segment to the left by one position.
        *   The vacated position to the far right of the shifted segment will now contain the value immediately to the right of the original segment.
        *   After each shift within the same row, recheck from the start index of the originally shifted segment for any further left shift possibilities in case the current segment needs to be shifted more than once.
    * If no different color exists to the right of the segment (all values to the right until the end of row are the same color) do not shift.

3. Repeat Step 2 for every inner row.
