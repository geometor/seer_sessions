            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program and supporting documentation.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a limited observation of the first training example. The subsequent tests on all three training examples reveal significant discrepancies. The core issue seems to be an oversimplification of the transformation rule. The rule isn't just about copying a neighbor's color if left and right neighbors are the same. There's a more complex pattern involving the propagation of colors, potentially influenced by \"barrier\" colors, and possibly some \"shifting\" of colors to the left, although it's not uniform shifting. The top and bottom rows are correctly identified to be invariant.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Meticulously examine each input-output pair, focusing on how colors change (or don't change) in the inner rows. Pay close attention to the *context* of each pixel \u2013 its neighbors not only to the left and right, but also above.\n2.  **Identify \"Stable\" Pixels:** Determine which pixels in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid. These might act as \"anchors\" or \"boundaries\" for the transformation.\n3.  **Pattern Refinement:** Instead of a simple \"copy if neighbors are the same\" rule, look for more complex relationships. It might be helpful to consider runs/sequences of same-color cells in original input rows and see how they transform.\n\n**Metrics and Example Analysis (using code execution for verification where needed):**\n\nI will use manual inspection aided by the provided outputs. No need for code execution here since differences are given.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input shape: (10, 10)\n    *   Output shape: (10, 10)\n    *   Pixels Off: 10\n    *   Key Observation: There is an error in the 8th and 9th row. Column six should have color '1' instead of color '3'. The original code copied the color '3' from the right neighbor, it looks like the propagation of color '3' stops because color '1' is an edge color.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input shape: (10, 10)\n    *   Output shape: (10, 10)\n    *   Pixels Off: 20\n    *   Key Observation: There is an error in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th row. The propagation of color '0' fails because the second row of column nine in the input is color '1'. The '1' appears to act as a boundary for the series of changes.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input shape: (10, 10)\n    *   Output shape: (10, 10)\n    *   Pixels Off: 11\n    *   Key Observation: There is a pattern that the change in the grid is shifting to left, but the change is limited in some inner cells.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

If it is equal, skip to the next. However, examine the pixels to the right. If consecutive pixels share the same color and the sequence is followed by a different color, the entire segment with the same color *shifts* one position to the left, only if the cell to the left is of a different color and is *not* part of an unchanged row. The \"different color\" pixel on the right of the same-color sequence effectively acts as a boundary, blocking a shift beyond it.\n\n4. If a series of repeating colors extends until the last column, no shift is applied and it remains unchanged.\n"
