facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids are of the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      The transformation primarily affects the inner regions of the grid.
  - observation: |
      The outermost rows and columns mostly stay the same, except if the replacement rule can apply.
  - observation: |
      Colors seem to be inserted or shifted based on their context within a row.
