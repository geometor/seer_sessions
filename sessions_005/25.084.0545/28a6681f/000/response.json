The primary element of change appears to be the insertion or shifting of existing colors, specifically in the central part of the grid. The transformation doesn't seem to involve complex rotations or mirroring, but rather localized modifications. There's a sense of maintaining the outer \"frame\" or edges of the input grid while modifying the inner section based on color patterns. Specifically, a color between other same colors will be replaced by the color on its right side.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
