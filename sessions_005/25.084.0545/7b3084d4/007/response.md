1.  **Identify Objects:** Detect all distinct contiguous regions (objects) of non-white pixels in the input grid. Each object is characterized by its color, dimensions (height, width), and the coordinates of its top-left pixel.

2. **Object Combination**
    If there are multiple objects with the same color, they are parts of a single object. Combine their shapes into one.

3.  **Order Objects:** Arrange the identified objects based on the order they appear in the output. This does NOT follow a simple top-left sorting. The order needs to be inferred by comparing colors between the input and expected output.

4.  **Construct Output (Stacking with Width Adjustment):**
    *   Iterate through the *reordered* input objects.
    *   Place each object's subgrid into the output grid.
       - Determine the object from the ordered object list.
       - Stack objects - place each object below the object that came before
       - Left align all objects. The width of the final grid is the width of the widest object.

5. **Object Dropping** If after combining by same-colored objects, placing in the output grid creates an overlap, the object should be dropped.
