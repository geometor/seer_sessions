"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of non-white (non-0) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Order Objects:** Sort the identified objects based on the coordinates of their top-left corner. Sort primarily by the y-coordinate (top to bottom) and secondarily by the x-coordinate (left to right).
3.  **Select Objects:** Choose the first four objects from the sorted list.
4.  **Extract Subgrids:** For each selected object, extract the smallest rectangular subgrid that completely contains the object.
5. **Determine Max Rows:** Determine the maximum number of rows (`max_rows`) among all extracted sub-grids.
6.  **Pad Subgrids:** Pad each subgrid with white pixels (0) as needed, so that each subgrid has height of `max_rows`. Do *not* pad the width.
7.  **Concatenate:** Horizontally concatenate the (potentially padded) subgrids, in the order they were selected, to form the final output grid.
