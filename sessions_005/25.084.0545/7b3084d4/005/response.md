1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of non-white (non-0) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Order Objects:** Sort the identified objects based on the coordinates of their top-left corner. Sort primarily by the y-coordinate (top to bottom) and secondarily by the x-coordinate (left to right).
3.  **Select Objects:** Choose the first four objects from the sorted list.
4.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid by interleaving the rows of the selected objects.  The output grid's height will be the sum of the heights of the first four objects, and the width will be the maximum width among the selected objects. For each "row group" (corresponding to the rows of an object):
    - Start with the first object's row.
    - Append pixels from the second object's corresponding row (if it exists), and so on up to the fourth object.
    - If an object doesn't have a corresponding row within the row group, skip it.
