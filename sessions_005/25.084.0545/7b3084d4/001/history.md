Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, structured observation, and a natural language program description.

**Perception of the Elements**

*   **Input Grids:**  Larger grids (20x20) with a lot of white space (color 0).  There are distinct regions of other colors, often forming horizontal or vertical lines.  These regions appear to be the primary "objects" of interest.
*   **Output Grids:** Significantly smaller grids.  They seem to be a condensed representation of the colored regions in the input, but the arrangement and selection of colors are not immediately obvious. The output grid has all colors present.
*   **Colors:**  A variety of colors are used, and the mapping between input and output colors isn't a simple one-to-one correspondence. Some colors are maintained, while others change.
*   **Spatial Relationships:** The output grid appears to maintain a *topological* relationship to input. For instance, colors near each other tend to stay together.

**YAML Fact Documentation**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids are 20x20, output grids are smaller and vary in size.
  - objects:
      - name: colored_regions
        properties:
          - type: contiguous_pixels
          - colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # All possible colors
          - shapes: [horizontal_lines, vertical_lines, blocks]
        actions:
          - transformed: True
        relationships:
          - spatial: adjacent_regions_maintained # Observe if adjacency in input is preserved in output
  - transformations:
      - type: color_mapping
        details: |
          Not a simple one-to-one mapping.  Some colors persist, others change. Requires careful analysis.
      - type: spatial_reduction
        details: |
          The input grid is significantly reduced in size to create the output.  
          The method of reduction isn't immediately obvious (not a simple crop or resize).
      - type: object_selection
        details: |
          Not all colored lines appear, there is a selection method.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Colored Regions:** Scan the input grid to find contiguous regions of non-white (non-0) pixels. Consider these regions as individual "objects."
2.  **Order by y-axis:** Order the regions from top to bottom. If they have the same top y coordinate, order by x axis, from left to right.
3. **Select Regions:** Select a subset, up to 4 regions.
4.  **Extract Sub-grids:** For each of the regions create a sub-grid, keeping only the minimum rectangle to contain the shape.
5.  **Concatenate Sub-grids:**  Stack the extracted sub-grids horizontally, left to right, to form the output grid.
