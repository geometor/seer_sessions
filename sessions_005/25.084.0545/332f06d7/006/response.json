The core idea of identifying contiguous regions and selectively changing colors within regions containing blue is correct. The errors on the other train examples are not due to any other reason than a runtime error.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Fix the `scipy` Dependency:**\n    I will remove `scipy` dependency and create a simple implementation for finding contiguous regions.\n\n2.  **Re-evaluate and Refine:**\n    Once the code is running without library errors, I will verify that it functions as expected, including after the removal of the library and replacing with a simple contiguous region finder.\n\n**Metrics and Example Analysis:**\n\nSince all examples are failing due to the `scipy` dependency, there isn't very much to review, but here are examples for analysis and reports that the code will be validated against.\n\n"
