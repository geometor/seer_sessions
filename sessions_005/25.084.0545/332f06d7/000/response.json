The color `3` (green) seems to be a background or frame, and is untouched. Colors `0`(white), `2`(red) are replaced under some specific condition. Color `1` (blue) appears to be a key object in each grid. The transformation seems to involve changing some colors to `1`(blue), and leaving others the same. The specific positions changed changes for each example, so a simple positional rule is unlikely. It's more likely the positions are relative to other objects in the input.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
