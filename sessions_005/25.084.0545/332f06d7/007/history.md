"""
1.  **Identify Contiguous Regions:** Find all contiguous regions (connected areas) of pixels, regardless of their color.  These are our "objects".
2.  **Blue Region Rule:** Within each region, *if* that region contains *any* blue (1) pixels:
    *   Change *all* white (0) pixels within that region to blue (1).
    *   Change *all* red (2) pixels within that region to blue (1).
3.  **Green Preservation:** Never change green (3) pixels.
4. **Other colors** Pixels of colors other than 0, 2 in regions with color 1 should not change.
5.  **No Other Changes:** Pixels in regions that *do not* contain blue should remain unchanged. (This is the critical part that needs validation against more examples).

Results for code_00.py:
Train Set Error: error:
No module named 'scipy'
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, the errors, and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The primary error is that the code relies on the `scipy` library, which is not available in the environment and caused the execution failure.

Beyond this immediate issue, while there are some errors in the code, the initial natural language program and the generated code capture a significant portion of the transformation logic. The core idea of identifying contiguous regions and selectively changing colors within regions containing blue is correct. The errors on the other train examples are not due to any other reason than a runtime error.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Fix the `scipy` Dependency:**
    I will remove `scipy` dependency and create a simple implementation for finding contiguous regions.

2.  **Re-evaluate and Refine:**
    Once the code is running without library errors, I will verify that it functions as expected, including after the removal of the library and replacing with a simple contiguous region finder.

**Metrics and Example Analysis:**

Since all examples are failing due to the `scipy` dependency, there isn't very much to review, but here are examples for analysis and reports that the code will be validated against.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Pixels are grouped into contiguous regions."
  - property: "Regions are defined by adjacent pixels of any color."
  - condition: "Regions containing at least one blue (1) pixel trigger a transformation."
  - action: "Within a blue-containing region, white (0) pixels become blue (1)."
  - action: "Within a blue-containing region, red (2) pixels become blue (1)."
  - constraint: "Green (3) pixels never change."
  - constraint: "Regions without blue pixels remain unchanged."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Contiguous Regions:** Divide the grid into contiguous regions.  Adjacency includes diagonals (8-way connectivity, not just 4-way). A region is a group of one or more connected pixels, regardless of their color.
2.  **Check for Blue:** For each region, determine if it contains *any* blue (1) pixels.
3.  **Conditional Transformation:**
    *   If a region contains blue:
        *   Change all white (0) pixels within that region to blue (1).
        *   Change all red (2) pixels within that region to blue (1).
    *   If a region does *not* contain blue:
        *   Leave all pixels in that region unchanged.
4.  **Green Invariance:** Never change green (3) pixels, regardless of their region.
