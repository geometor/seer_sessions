            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and subsequent code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and code were a good first attempt, focusing on identifying an azure line and then processing \"stripes\" of adjacent pixels. However, the results on the training examples reveal a critical flaw in the logic: it is not correctly replacing colors at the top and bottom of adjacent stripes. It appears to be stopping when it hits azure, rather than using azure as an initial reference point.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Stripe Identification:** The current `get_object_stripes` function seems to be including azure in stripes, which will need fixing, and also is not correctly splitting into individual objects based on the expected output.\n2.  **Clarify Top/Bottom Replacement:** The logic for replacing colors at the top and bottom of stripes is not applied correctly relative to the complete object. We need to find the true top and bottom extents of the complete object.\n3. **Consider object extents**: The lowest element of the stripe is not always the lowest element of the object.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (from provided test output):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 16\n    *   Issue: The code is not identifying the different color 'stripes' adjacent to the azure line and modifying the top and buttom elements with the lowest color of each stripe.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 12\n    *   Issue: Similar to Example 1, the code fails. It seems that when a stripe has multiple segments, it gets confused about the vertical extents.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 4\n    *   Issue: The code appears to be processing the central '1' object. It is changing the top and buttom of the object correctly.\n\n**YAML Fact Representation:**\n\n"
