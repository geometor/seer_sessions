These objects consist of colored \"stripes\".\n*   **Object Constancy:** The core structure (the vertical line with object \"stripes\") seems to be mostly preserved between input and output, but a part of it gets removed.\n*\t**Change:** It appears a consistent change is applied near the azure object stripe: The top and the buttom elements are being removed, and replaced by the last element of the stripe.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts**\n\n"

It may not always be straight, and may change position and size.\n\n2.  **Locate object stripes:** Starting from the azure vertical line, locate the sets of adjacent horizontal pixels of the same color (excluding azure) on both the left and the right. We identify each set of horizontal pixels with the same color as a stripe.\n\n3. **Iterate each object stripe**: For each identified stripe:\n    * Iterate from top to buttom.\n    * Get the color of the lowest element of the stripe.\n    * Iterate from left to right.\n    * If it is the top or buttom row, set the color to the lowest color of that stripe.\n\n4.  **Produce Output:** The modified grid, with the specified changes, becomes the output.\n"
