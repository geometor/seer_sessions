            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of the Elements of the Task**\n\nThe task involves transforming grids of colored pixels. The most prominent feature is the presence of irregular \"objects\" composed of connected pixels of the same color, embedded within a larger, uniform background (color 8, azure). These objects appear to be the primary focus of the transformation. The transformation seems to involve some kind of \"mirroring\" or \"inversion\" of parts of these objects, and sometimes, changes in color in a patterned or structured way. It's not a simple global transformation; it acts selectively on specific regions or objects within the grid.  The background remains largely untouched, except possibly in areas *adjacent* to the transformed objects. The output grids maintains the general structure, with changes happening relative to object shape.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1. **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions of non-azure (color 8) pixels.  Consider each of these regions as a separate object.\n\n2. **Object Partitioning**: Visually divide each object into subregions. The partitioning isn't explicitly defined, but seems to involve finding lines of symmetry or axes of reflection *within* each object. Think of it like folding the object; the transformation mimics a partial, selective fold.\n\n3. **Selective Mirroring/Inversion:**  For each object, a subregion is selected, and its shape is mirrored/inverted. This effectivly expands or shrinks the cluster in areas diagonally adjacent.\n\n4. **Color Transformation (within mirrored region):** After the shape transformation, apply the following color changes *only within the mirrored region*:\n   - If train example has maroon(9) it gets replaced with a different number in the mirror:\n     - Example 1: Maroon (9) becomes itself.\n     - Example 2: Maroon (9) becomes White (7).\n     - Example 3: The shape expands.\n   - These changes happen within a mirrored shape:\n      - Example 1:\n          - Yellow (4) <-> Magenta (6)\n      - Example 2:\n         - Orange (7) <-> Blue (1)\n      - Example 3:\n         - Gray (5) is preserved\n         - Green (3) is added to diagonally adjacent pixels.\n\n5. **Background Preservation:** Leave the azure (color 8) background pixels unchanged, except where they are directly adjacent to the mirrored region in which case they should not be changed.\n\n6. **Iterative process.** It is possible to iterate several time over the identified process.\n"
