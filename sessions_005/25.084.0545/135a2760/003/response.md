The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  **Preserve the Border:** The outermost rows and columns of the grid remain identical in the input and output.
2.  **Interior Transformation:** For cells not on the border:
    *   Examine horizontal runs of digits. Vertical runs do *not* appear to matter.
    *   It appears that runs of length 3 or greater are modified.
    *   The color '2' is never modified.
    *   Within a modifiable run, it's NOT simply every other pixel.
    *   The pattern of modification seems to depend on the length of the run, and likely the position in the run.
    *   It looks like long runs of the SAME color have pixels changed.
        Train 1: 3s changed from 3 3 3 3 3 3 to 3 1 3 1 3 1
        Train 2: longer runs are truncated - i.e., 3 3 3 4...becomes 3 3 4
