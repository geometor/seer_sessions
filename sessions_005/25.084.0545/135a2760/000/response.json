The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve changing, or maintaining specific digits based on their surrounding neighbors. There appears to be some sensitivity towards runs of the same digit, but not in the obvious way. The outer border is always maintained.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

It appears that alternating elements within long runs of the same color *other than* 2 are changed.
