Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improvement.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was a good first attempt, assuming a simple column selection. However, the results clearly show this isn't the complete rule. While the size is correct in all three test cases, the pixel values and color counts are off, indicating errors in the selection process. The strategy needs to shift from simply selecting the first *n* columns to a more nuanced selection or transformation based on the content of the input grid. We must also account for variations between training examples, because the code now attempts to account for them.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze Incorrect Pixels:** We need to identify *why* the selected pixels are wrong. Are they the wrong color? Are they in the wrong position? This requires a detailed comparison of the input, expected output, and transformed output.
2.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for patterns in the *differences* between the expected and transformed outputs. This might reveal a more complex selection rule or a transformation applied to the selected columns.
3.  **Re-evaluate Assumptions:** The initial assumption of selecting the first *n* columns is incorrect. We must consider other possibilities like:
    *   Selecting columns based on content (e.g., columns containing specific colors).
    *   Applying a transformation to the selected columns (e.g., shifting colors, inverting colors).
    * some combination of selection and minimal transformation

**Gather Metrics and Reports:**

I will use the provided error reports to analyze the results. Here are some of the observations:

*   **Example 1:** The transformed output has some misplaced '4' (blue) pixels. Expected output did not have those blues, so it is clear error and the transformation is adding.
*   **Example 2:** The transformed output correctly places many values, but fails to completely capture the change in row 5, and does not seem to be related to the input data.
*   **Example 3:** The transformed output mostly captures structure of the output, but fails to get color locations exactly correct.

**YAML Fact Identification:**

      transformations:

        - detail: "places some values incorrectly, column width appears correct"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Determine Output Width:** The width of the output grid varies between examples. In the provided training examples it appears to be explicitly provided, and varies among the three examples.
2. **Column Content Selection:** Instead of taking the leftmost columns, the transformation selects columns from the input based some selection criteria. This criteria *may* include pixels values or be solely based on the location. The error analysis suggests the selection process is based on the presence or absence of specific color values.
3. **Pixel Transformation (Possible):** After the columns selection, the selected columns may be subject to pixel edits.

The core of the task seems to be selecting columns based on the values, perhaps limited to taking only the leftmost columns that have a specific characteristic.
