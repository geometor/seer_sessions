The most obvious change is a reduction in size and the elimination of specific colors. It appears that certain columns are being removed based on some criteria related to the colors present within those columns. Specifically, columns containing the color associated with the digit '3' (green) in example 1, color '2'(red) and sometime '3'(green) in the second example and '4' (yellow) in the third example, are removed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

It's crucial to identify the specific color that triggers column removal. Example 1 uses '3'(green), example 2 uses '2'(red) and also some columns with '3'(green) and example 3 uses '4'(yellow).\n2.  **Iterate through Columns:** Examine each column of the input grid.\n3.  **Check for Target Color:** For the current column, check if it contains the target color identified in step 1.\n4.  **Remove or Keep:**\n    *   If the target color is present in the column, remove the entire column.\n    *   If the target color is not present in the column, keep the column.\n5.  **Construct Output:** The output grid is formed by the remaining columns after the removal process.\n\nThe core logic is a conditional column removal based on the presence of a specific, pre-determined color within each column. This needs to change per example input/output set, as the eliminated color is not consistent.\n"
