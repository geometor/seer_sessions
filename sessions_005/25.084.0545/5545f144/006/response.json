            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the information and a strategy for improving the natural language program and subsequently the code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe code attempts to select columns based on specific criteria for each example, but it's overly specific and doesn't generalize well. The strategy of picking columns containing certain colors is correct, but the criteria used isn't robust enough, causing errors in pixel matching and color counts. Essentially, we are on the correct path by focusing on properties of the columns, but it is being done incorrectly for 2 of the examples. The approach assumes a fixed output size, which is correct but needs to be derived correctly from the columns.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Column Properties:** We need to shift from hardcoded criteria (e.g., `sum(input_grid[:, j_in] == 1) >= 8`) to a more generalizable description of why columns are selected. Instead of looking for specific counts, we should look for column characteristics that differentiate the chosen columns from the others *within each example*.\n2.  **Find Common Selection Rule:** Examine all examples to identify a unifying principle for column selection. Is it about the *most frequent* color? Is it about a specific *pattern* of colors within the column?\n3.  **Output Size Determination:** Confirm the rule for determining output width. It seems related to columns, and it will be re-verified.\n4. **Iterative Refinement:** Use a combination of looking at the \"Transformed Output\" and the \"Expected Output\" along with color counts of Input and \"Expected Output\" to deduce any common rules.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis (using the already available results, no need for tool use at this point):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (10, 26)\n    *   Output Shape: (10, 8)\n    *   Expected Output Colors: Mostly 1 (blue), some 4 (yellow)\n    *   Transformed Output: Correct size, but some misplaced 4s. The selection criteria (`sum(input_grid[:, j_in] == 1) >= 8`) are too strict; it missed a valid column with some 4s.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (8, 27)\n    *   Output Shape: (8, 6)\n    *   Expected Output Colors: Mostly 0 (white), a single row of 3 (green) towards the bottom\n    *   Transformed Output: Correct size and mostly correct colors, but misplaced the row with 3's, an off-by-one error in row index. The column selection criteria (`sum(input_grid[:, j_in] == 0) >= 6`) seem good, but not fully sufficient, as we don't want to include the 3's.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (12, 25)\n    *   Output Shape: (12, 12)\n    *   Expected Output Colors: Mostly 5 (grey), some 6 (magenta)\n    *   Transformed Output: Correct size and colors, but the positions of the 6's are off in a few places. The selection criteria (`sum(input_grid[:, j_in] == 5) >= 9`) are almost correct, but it misses the subtle positional/pattern requirement of the 6's.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The number of columns in the output grid is equal to the number of columns in the input grid that have the most frequent color as identified in step 3.\n5. Copy the entire selected columns from the input to the output. Preserve original column ordering when placing into output.\n\nIn simpler terms: The output grid consists of columns from the input grid where the most frequent color in the column is the same as the overall most frequent color in the input. The output width is determined by how many columns meet this criterion.\n"
