            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize improvements.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe code fails on all three training examples, indicating a significant flaw in the approach. The primary issue appears to be the flood fill and the red border application. The flood fill doesn't correctly isolate the inner white regions, and the red border is applied incorrectly \u2013 it appears everywhere next to the gray stripe and doesn't consider if original magenta pixels are part of a larger object.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Flood Fill:** The current flood fill is too aggressive, replacing white pixels even within the intended central shape. We must ensure it only fills the *exterior* white areas.\n\n2.  **Improve Red Border Logic:** The red border should only apply to the *original* magenta pixels that are *immediately to the left* of the gray stripe AND are part of the boundary between the exterior magenta and the gray.\n\n3.  **Consider Objectness:** It is not sufficient to identify individual magenta pixels. The solution must preserve internal object holes of the same color of the background.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using conceptual analysis, not `tool_code` yet):**\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Gray Stripe Pos (x) | Original Magenta Count | Pixels Off | Notes                                                                        |\n| ------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | 16x16       | 16x16        | 11                  | 52                     | 53          | Flood fill almost eliminates white, Red border all wrong                     |\n| 2       | 16x10       | 16x10        | 5                   | 26                     | 52              | Flood fill almost eliminates white, Red border all wrong         |\n| 3       | 20x10       | 20x10        | 7                   | 30                     | 65          | Flood fill almost eliminates white, Red border all wrong, interior not respected |\n\n**YAML Fact Extraction:**\n\n"
