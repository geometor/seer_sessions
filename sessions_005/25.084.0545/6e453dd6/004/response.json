            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, and it's clear it doesn't generalize well to the other examples. The main issues are:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Flood Fill:** The flood fill is replacing too much of the background. It seems to be overwriting white (0) pixels that are *inside* the original magenta (6) shape, not just the exterior background.\n2.  **Incorrect Red Border Placement:** The red (2) border is being applied incorrectly. It looks like it's being placed to the *left* of the gray stripe in *all* cases, and not just where the gray stripe is horizontally adjacent to the *original* magenta shape. It is also incorrectly placed at the gray stripe.\n3. **Overly Aggressive Magenta Fill** the flood fill covers internal white (0) regions that were surrounded by magenta (6).\n4. **Incorrect Border Application** a red (2) border is placed at the location of the grey (5) stripe.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Flood Fill:** Restrict the flood fill to only replace white (0) pixels that are connected to the *edge* of the grid and are *not* part of the initial magenta shape. We need to use a visited set, or similar mechanism, to accurately track the visited cells during the flood fill.\n2.  **Correct Red Border Logic:** Ensure the red border is placed *only* on the original magenta pixels that are immediately to the left of the gray stripe. We already have the `original_magenta` set, so we can use that effectively.\n3. **Remove red placement at gray stripe**: The gray stripe pixels themselves should never be altered.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (using manual inspection, code execution is not necessary for this):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 59\n    *   Problem: Flood fill overwrites internal white pixels. Red border is placed on all columns to left and at gray stripe.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 62\n    *   Problem: Similar to Example 1. Flood fill overwrites. Red placement at gray stripe, and far too many red.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *    Pixels Off: 75\n    *   Problem: Similar to Example 1. Flood fill overwrites, and misplaced red border.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

These define the \"central shape.\"\n3.  **Exterior Flood Fill:** Starting from the edges of the grid, perform a flood fill operation.\n    *   Replace white (0) pixels with magenta (6) pixels.\n    *   *Crucially*, do *not* perform the fill on any pixel whose coordinates were stored in step 2 (the original magenta pixels).  This preserves the interior white areas of the central shape. Use a visited set to avoid cycles.\n4.  **Apply Red Border:** Iterate through the (x, y) coordinates stored in step 2 (original magenta pixels).\n    *   For each coordinate (x, y), check if the pixel at (x+1, y) is part of the gray stripe identified in step 1.\n    *   If it is, change the color of the pixel at (x, y) to red (2).\n5. The gray stripe itself should be unchanged.\n6.  **Output:** The modified grid is the final output.\n\nThis revised natural language program is more accurate and addresses the issues observed in the test results. The key improvement is the more precise description of the flood fill, emphasizing that it only affects the *exterior* background and preserves the internal structure of the original magenta shape. Also adding the specification that the gray stripe remains unchanged.\n"
