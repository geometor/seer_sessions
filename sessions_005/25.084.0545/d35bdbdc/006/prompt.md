"""
1.  **Object Identification:** Define objects as contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color, forming a closed shape (not a single line, except for single pixels).
2.  **Border Check:** If an object is completely surrounded by the background color (0), the entire object is preserved without changes.
3.  **Interior Removal:** If an object is *not* entirely surrounded by 0:
    *   Identify the "interior" pixels of the objects. Interior pixels are defined as pixels that are *not* on the outer edge of an object.
    *   If the object contains any of the colors 2, 4, 6 inside the object, the entire interior of that object becomes 0.
    *   If the entire object consists of color 1, 2, or 3, the entire object becomes 0.
4.  **Special Rule for Color 9:** If a single pixel object of color 9 exists:
    *   If the color 9 pixel is directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, *or diagonally*) to a pixel of color 1 *and* to a pixel of color 2, the 9 pixel becomes 3. Otherwise, the 9 pixel remains unchanged.
