The transformation seems to selectively remove or change pixels based on some criteria. Certain colors and shapes appear more susceptible to change than others.  There's a strong sense of object permanence, where solid blocks of color tend to either remain or disappear entirely, as opposed to being partially modified. There is a sense of objectness for solid blocks of the same color.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The rule of modification can also be describes as, all inner most pixels are removed, except:\n    - Pixels on blocks with values: 3, 7, 8\n    - If the block color is 9 and it surrounds a blue(1) it is transformed to 3\n\n5.  **Output:** Construct the output grid with the modified/removed pixels.\n\n"
