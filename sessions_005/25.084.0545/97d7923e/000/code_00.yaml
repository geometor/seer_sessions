task_type: grid_transformation
observations:
  - objects:
      - type: grid_cell
        properties:
          - color: integer (0-9)
          - position: (row, column)
  - relationships:
      - adjacency: cells are considered adjacent vertically (above and below)
  - transformations:
     - type: color_change_vertical
       conditions:
          - neighbor_check:  Specific colors are replaced based on adjacent vertical neighbors
       actions:
           - color_replacement: If a specific color is in the bottom cell of the vertical pair, the bottom color replaces the upper
