observations:
  - task: Vertical Color Propagation
  - objects:
    - grid: 2D array of colored pixels
    - pixels: individual cells within the grid, identified by row and column
  - properties:
    - color: integer value (0-9) representing the pixel's color
    - position: (row, column) tuple indicating the pixel's location
  - actions:
    - color_propagation:
      - description: A color from a lower cell propagates upwards, replacing the colors of cells above it.
      - trigger:  If a cell has a different color than the cell directly above it, and the color in the cell below *is not* 0, the color above is replaced with the color of the cell below. This is repeated until the color above is not a different color.
      - propagation_limit: Continues upwards until it encounters a cell with a different non-zero color, the same color, or the top edge of the grid.
