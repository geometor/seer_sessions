The transformation seems to involve a complex combination of:\n1.  **Object Identification**: There are background colors are 0, and the last row of unique colors.\n2.  **Color Substitution**:  It looks like colors from the last row, that are not 0, replace corresponding colors in the grid.\n3. **Transposition** The input appears to be transposed.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
