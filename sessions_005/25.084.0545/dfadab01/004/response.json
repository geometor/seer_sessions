            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the natural language program and the subsequent code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and code correctly identified the anti-diagonal mirroring aspect of the transformation. However, the color transformation logic is flawed and doesn't consistently produce the expected output. The primary issue is that the code applies the color changes based on the *original* input grid's colors, but the color transformation depends on where a pixel is located relative to others *after* mirroring. In many cases the transform is applied incorrectly or not at all.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Understanding:** Double-check the anti-diagonal mirroring concept with a simple example to ensure the implementation and understanding of the mirroring process are correct.\n2.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the failed test cases (Examples 1, 2, and 3) to pinpoint exactly *where* and *why* the color transformations are incorrect. Focus specifically on pixels that should have changed color but didn't, and vice-versa. This requires understanding the mirrored position's context.\n3.  **Refine Color Transformation Logic:** Update the natural language program to accurately describe the color transformation rules *after* mirroring. It isn't sufficient to simply consider individual pixel colors; the rule likely depends on the spatial relationship between pixels of certain colours.\n4.  **Iterative Testing:** After modifying the natural language program and code, rigorously re-test against all available examples.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis (using code execution):**\n\nI don't need to use `tool_code` here, the initial prompt provided all necessary information from tool use:\n- The scores and details for each example case\n- comparison of the transformed output with the expected output\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n\n"

The element at `input[r][c]` will be placed at `output[c][r]`.\n\n2.  **Conditional Recoloring (Based on Post-Mirroring Relationships):** After mirroring, analyze the spatial relationships between pixels to apply these color transformations:\n    * Identify \"lines\" or contiguous blocks of pixels in certain colors in the *mirrored* grid.\n    *   If the *mirrored* pixel at `[c][r]` is part of a horizontal contiguous block of blue (1) pixels in output:\n        *  change pixels to the left of the contiguous block blue to white (0)\n        *  change pixels to the right of the contiguous block to blue (1)\n        * change pixels above of the contiguous block to green(3).\n    *  If there are areas of 2x2 of yellow (4) with one of the pixels black (0) at [r][c]: change to orange (7).\n        *   If the *mirrored* pixel at `[c][r]` was originally red (2) *and* is now adjacent to a mirrored pixel that was originally yellow(4), change the pixel to orange (7).\n        *  If the mirrored pixel at [c][r] contains an orange(7), change to black(0).\n3.  **Default Color Preservation:** If a pixel's color, *after* mirroring, doesn't meet the above relationship-based criteria, it retains its color from the mirroring step (i.e., the original color from `input[r][c]`).\n\nThe key change is in Step 2. Instead of recoloring based on the *original* input color, we now recolor based on the *mirrored* grid's pixel relationships. This takes spatial context into account.\n"
