task: anti_diagonal_mirror_and_recolor
observations:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
    actions:
      - mirrored: along the anti-diagonal
      - recolored: based on a specific mapping, relative to input
  - color_mapping_rules:
      input_color: output_color
      2: 4
      3: 1
      5: 6
      6: 0
  - mirroring:
      description: Each pixel at (r, c) in the input is moved to (c, r) in the output.
  - default_behavior:
      description: Colors not in the mapping rules remain unchanged.
