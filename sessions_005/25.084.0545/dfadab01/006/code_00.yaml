      - dimensions: variable
    actions:
      - mirror: anti-diagonal

  - name: contiguous_block
    type: line_segment
    properties:
      - color: int
      - orientation: [horizontal, vertical] # After mirroring
      - length: int > 0
    actions:
      - recolor_adjacent: based on color and relative position

  - name:  four_block
    type: square
    properties:
      - size:  2x2
      - colors: [yellow]
    actions:
      - recolor_adjacent: based on color and relative position

transformations:
  - step: 1
    action: mirror grid along anti-diagonal
  - step: 2
    condition:  output contains horizontal lines of blue (1)
    action: recolor pixels to the left as white(0)
  - step: 3
    condition: output contains horizontal lines of blue(1)
    action: recolor pixels to the right as blue(1)
  - step: 4
    condition:  output contains horizontal lines of blue (1)
    action: recolor above pixels as green (3)
  - step: 5
    condition: output contains 2x2 block of yellow (4)
    action: change all yellow(4) in block to orange(7)
  - step: 6
    condition: output contains orange (7)
    action: change orange(7) to black(0)
