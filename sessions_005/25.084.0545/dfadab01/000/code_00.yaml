facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids can have different dimensions."
  - objects:
    - type: "grid"
      properties:
        - "2D array of integers (colors)"
        - "variable height and width"
    - type: "pixel"
      properties:
        - "color (represented by an integer)"
        - "position (row, column)"
  - actions:
    - name: "mirror_grid"
      description: "Mirrors the positions of the input grid across the anti-diagonal"
    - name: "recolor"
      description: "Changes selected pixel colors based on input colors"
      details: >-
        If the input pixel is red (2), output becomes yellow (4).
        If the input pixel is green (3), output becomes blue (1).
        If the input pixel is grey (5), output becomes magenta(6).
        If the input pixel is magenta (6) the output pixel is white (0).

  - relationships:
      - "output grid pixel colors depend on mirrored position input colors"
