The mirroring is performed along the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left). This means the element at input[r][c] will be placed at output[c][r].\n\n2.  **Conditional Recoloring (Based on Input):** *After* placing the mirrored pixel in the output grid, apply a color transformation *based on the original input grid's color* at position [r][c].\n    *   If the *input* pixel at [r][c] was red (2), the *output* pixel at [c][r] becomes yellow (4).\n    *   If the *input* pixel at [r][c] was green (3), the *output* pixel at [c][r] becomes blue (1).\n    *   If the *input* pixel at [r][c] was grey (5), the *output* pixel at [c][r] becomes magenta (6).\n    *   If the *input* pixel at [r][c] was magenta (6), the *output* pixel at [c][r] becomes white (0).\n\n3.  **Default Color Preservation:** If an input pixel's color at [r][c] is not part of the specific color transformation rules (i.e., not 2, 3, 5 or 6), then the output pixel at [c][r] retains the *original* color from the mirrored position.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    output_grid = np.zeros((cols, rows), dtype=int)\n\n    # Mirror along the anti-diagonal and apply recoloring.\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Mirror: Place input[r][c] at output[c][r].\n            output_grid[c, r] = input_grid[r, c]\n\n            # Recolor based on the *original* input color.\n            if input_grid[r, c] == 2:  # Red to Yellow\n                output_grid[c, r] = 4\n            elif input_grid[r, c] == 3:  # Green to Blue\n                output_grid[c, r] = 1\n            elif input_grid[r, c] == 5:  # Grey to Magenta\n                output_grid[c, r] = 6\n            elif input_grid[r, c] == 6:  # Magenta to White\n                output_grid[c, r] = 0\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
