facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Output grids represent a compressed/abstracted version of the input.
  - object: Input grids contain colored regions (objects).
  - property: Colors include: blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4), gray (5), magenta (6), orange (7), azure (8), maroon (9), white (0).
  - property: Object shapes vary (rectangles, irregular).
  - action: Transformation extracts and compresses color information.
  - relationship: Spatial relationships between colors are somewhat preserved.
  - observation: Some colors from input are filtered/ignored in output. (e.g., yellow(4) and gray(5) appear in train input 1 but not output, similarly for gray(5) and white(0) in train inputs 2&3)
  - observation: '0' white/gray color acts as a background in all input grids, this color doesn't feature in the output except for a small number of cells (one '0' in output 1)
  - observation: The output grids tend to be rectangular, even if the input "objects" are of various shapes.
  - observation: The transformation rule changes from example to example.
