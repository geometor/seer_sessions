facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Input grids have a consistent structure with a mostly blue (1) top row with a single white (0) in the top left, followed by a row of azure (8).
  - observation: Color regions in the input are contiguous.
  - observation: Only color regions with at least two of the same colors touching either side by side or diagonally are in the output.
  - observation: The output grid contains a subset of the colors from the input grid.
  - observation: The colors 0, 1, and 2 and the complete second row of 8 are always removed.
  - observation: Color of pixels in a connected group are preserved from input to output.
  - observation: Spatial relationships within connected groups of pixels from the main body (below the second row) of the input grid are preserved in the output grid
  - observation: The order of the groups in the output seems derived row by row by from the original positions in the input.
