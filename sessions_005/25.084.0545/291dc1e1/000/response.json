            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on elements, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a larger input grid into a smaller output grid. The input grids consistently have a top row of mostly `1`s (blue) with a leading `0` (white). The second row is all `8`s (azure).  Below that are regions of different colors. The key seems to be identifying and extracting specific colored regions from the input and arranging them in a specific way in the output. The output grid seems to maintain the spatial relationships of clustered same-color pixels within the input, but removes the `1`s, the `0`s, and the `2`s and second rows of `8` pixels, significantly reducing the size of the grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Each horizontal color block forms two rows in the output with identical colors.\n\nEssentially, the transformation extracts and compacts colored regions while discarding the top two rows and the colors 0, 1, and 2. The output grid reconstructs these extracted color regions in a compressed format, creating pairs of identical rows.\n"
