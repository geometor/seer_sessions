            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation rule, along with the requested deliverables:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe current code attempts to extract contiguous regions of colors (excluding 0, 1, and 2), sort them by top-left position, and then reconstruct them into a new grid. The reconstruction places two rows of each color, with the width determined by the original region's horizontal extent.  The primary issue is that the reconstructed regions are not maintaining their correct relative positioning and shapes, and there's an issue with how the width calculation is causing overlaps, which are overwrites due to the use of `np.zeros`.\n\nThe strategy will involve these steps:\n\n1.  **Refine Region Extraction:** Ensure regions are correctly identified and their boundaries are accurate.\n2.  **Improve Spatial Reconstruction:** Maintain the original x,y offsets of the region.\n3.  **Revisit Width/Height Logic:** The current approach of using two rows and the original width seems flawed based on looking at the examples.  It is two rows, but there's more to the relationship than currently modeled.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (via Manual Inspection and Reasoning - Code Execution Not Necessary for This Step)**\n\nHere's a breakdown of observations from each example, focusing on discrepancies:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   The output grid is much wider than expected.\n    *   The arrangement of the colors is not as expected based on input. The x and y positions and shape information is lost.\n    *   Zeroes are filling the rest of the area where color is not added.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Similar to Example 1, the output is wider, and spatial arrangement is incorrect. Zeros fill spaces.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Output is very wide, much wider than the expected output.\n    *   Zeros are filling up the large empty space\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *    Output is very wide, much wider than the expected output.\n    *   Zeros are filling up the large empty space\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n"
