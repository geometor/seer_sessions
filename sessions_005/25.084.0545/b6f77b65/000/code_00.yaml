facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels.
  - type: object
    description: Contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color can be considered objects.
  - type: operation
    description: Objects are moved, and sometimes deleted.
  - type: region
    description: The grid can be conceptually divided into regions that are affected differently. A likely division is near rows 3-6, based on how it looks, although I can't say it's a hard and fast rule.
  - type: color_invariance
    description: The transformation isn't a simple color mapping; the same color can be treated differently in different locations.
  - type: movement
    description: The movement of objects/pixels is not a simple translation or rotation.  It appears to be a more complex rearrangement.
  - type: conditional
    description: The transformation logic appears conditional, depending on object properties and/or location.
  - type: specific_observation
    description: in example 2, The block starting with gray, blue, blue, blue, green, orange gets moved up several lines and left by 3 pixels.
