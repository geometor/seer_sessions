The core operation seems to be a complex rearrangement and, in some cases, deletion or shifting of colored pixel blocks within the grid. It's not a simple mirroring, rotation, or global color substitution. There appear to be multiple distinct regions or objects within each grid that are treated differently.  The upper section of the grid seems to be treated differently than the lower section in several examples. There are regions that get deleted and others that get shuffled around. The changes are not uniform, meaning different parts of the grid follow different rules.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"

A likely division is near rows 3-6, based on how it looks, although I can't say it's a hard and fast rule.\n  - type: color_invariance\n    description: The transformation isn't a simple color mapping; the same color can be treated differently in different locations.\n  - type: movement\n    description: The movement of objects/pixels is not a simple translation or rotation.  It appears to be a more complex rearrangement.\n  - type: conditional\n    description: The transformation logic appears conditional, depending on object properties and/or location.\n  - type: specific_observation\n    description: in example 2, The block starting with gray, blue, blue, blue, green, orange gets moved up several lines and left by 3 pixels.\n```"
