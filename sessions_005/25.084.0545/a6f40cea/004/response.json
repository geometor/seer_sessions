            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe current code identifies objects (contiguous regions of the same color) and attempts to reconstruct a simplified version of the input in the output. However, it's clear from the test results that the reconstruction logic is flawed and incomplete. It seems to be focusing on reporting the top and bottom rows of identified objects, and sometimes a middle row, but the selection criteria and overall arrangement are incorrect. The output grid size is also often miscalculated, and many colors are mis-placed.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors will involve:\n\n1.  **Improving Object Representation:** Focusing not just on bounding boxes, but possibly also on key features within each object (e.g., corners, edges).\n2.  **Refining Output Logic:**  Instead of just reporting parts of objects, we need a more sophisticated rule for deciding *which* parts of *which* objects are represented in the output, and *where*.\n3.  **Considering Object Relationships:** The current code treats each object independently. We might need to consider relationships *between* objects (e.g., relative positions, containment).\n4.  **Adaptive Output Size:** Dynamically determine output grid size, and account for object overlap.\n\n**Gathering Metrics and Evidence (using code execution):**\n\nFirst, let's define a helper function to compute some basic metrics, then apply it to each example pair.\n\n"
