      The output includes representations of red and yellow objects.
      The green object is not represented. The red object appears "on top" of the yellow in the input
      and overlaps it.

      The output includes a representation of objects 4, 5, 8, and 9.
      The large green object is ignored. The output seems to be made of 2x2 groups of smaller objects.
      The maroon and azure object are in a stack, and the green object separates them.
