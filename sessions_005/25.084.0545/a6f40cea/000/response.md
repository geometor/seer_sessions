Okay, let's analyze these input-output examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   The inputs are large grids filled predominantly with a single color (8 in train_1, 1 in train_2, and 2 in train_3), which we can consider the background.
*   Within these grids, there are distinct regions of other colors forming shapes.
*   The outputs are significantly smaller grids.
*   The outputs seem to extract or highlight specific parts of the input, particularly focusing on certain colors or color transitions.
*   There is a possibility that it is some form of a sliding window and some condition on it.
*   The shapes that constitute object appear in the compressed form in the output.
*   The output grid size is smaller than the in put and varies.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - size: large (variable)
      - description: Contains background color and regions of other colors.

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - size: small (variable)
      - description: Appears to be a compressed or extracted representation of the input.

  - observation: color_focus
    description: The transformation seems to focus on specific colors or color changes.

  - observation: size_reduction
    description: The output grid is always smaller than the input grid.

  - observation: shape_retention
    description: object shapes are some how compressed in output.

  - observation: possible_sliding_window
      description: there appears to be sliding aspect to building the output.

  - action: extract_region
    description: Certain color changes or object combinations may mark the boundaries in the input grid that form the compressed object of output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Colors:** In each example, there's a set of "key colors" that are not the background. The output seems to be constructed based on these and sometimes the adjacent colors.

2. **Sliding Window Approach**: Iterate the color of the objects, the output would be based on the object in the input with that color, for example, in train\_1, start with color 2, and form a sliding window to capture the rectangle of color 2, then move on to color 4. The height of the rectangle can be determined by the top-most and bottom-most object coordinates.

3.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** For each object of the same color, determine the bounding box that captures them all and compress them.

4.  **Populate Output:** Fill the output grid with the extracted region, maintaining relative positions of different colored regions, with the color of the sliding window as a parameter, it can be one color or the neighboring color of that color.

5. **Compress Objects**: compress objects if they have many repeating values on the same row.

Let's summarize in steps for the provided example:
* train_1
    1. The background is 8 (azure). The key colors are 2(red), 3(green) and 4(yellow).
    2. Find bounding box for objects of color 2. It is from (4,9) to (6, 15) and its compressed version is from (1,4) to (2,7)
    3. Find the object with color 4. It is from (10, 3) to (14, 8) and its compressed version is from (3, 1) to (4, 3)
    4. Compose two extracted regions to create final output.

* train_2
    1. The background is 1 (blue). The key colors are 2(red), 3(green), 6(magenta) and 8(light blue).
    2. Find bounding box for objects of color 2. It is from (4,7) to (20, 14). Then the object of color 8 is from (9, 18) to (12, 22). Since the color 8 object is adjacent to the object of color 2, combine this object with color 2, which would result to the box from (4,7) to (12, 22). The compressed version will be from (1, 3) to (8, 7)
    3. Find the object with color 6. It is from (13, 11) to (26, 26). It has neighbor of color 3, so we get from (12, 11) to (26, 26). And its compressed version will be (1,1) to (14, 1)
    4. Find the object with color 8. It is from (27, 18) to (28, 22) and it compressed object is (1, 8) to (14, 8).
    5. Find the object with color 8. It is from (9, 18) to (12, 22) and it compressed object is (1, 9) to (14, 9).
    4. Compose all extracted compressed regions to create final output.

* train_3
    1. The background is 2 (red). The key colors are 3(green), 4(yellow), 5(grey), 8(light blue) and 9(maroon).
    2. Find bounding box for objects of color 4 and 5. They are from (4, 4) to (7, 9) and its compressed version is from (1, 1) to (2, 4)
    3. Find the object with color 9 and 8. It is from (14, 16) to (18, 19) and its compressed version will be from (6, 2) to (7, 7)
    4. Compose all extracted regions to create final output.
