facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids are 2D arrays of integers representing colors.
  - objects: |
      Objects are contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color.
  - object_properties:
      - color: Integer value (0-9)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
      - shape: Contiguous block, can be irregular
      - size: Number of pixels in the block
  - actions:
      - extraction: |
        Specific objects or parts of objects are selected from the input.
      - rearrangement: |
        Extracted objects are repositioned in the output grid.
      - deletion: |
        Pixels not selected are not present in the output.
        The entire input grid is not replicated; only specific objects, sometimes restructured
  - relationships:
    - adjacency: |
      Pixels of the same color that are directly next to each other (horizontally or vertically) form an object.
    - spatial:  Relative positions of objects are important for the transformation. It seems some reordering occurs
    - part_of: some colored pixels are parts of larger multi-colored objects in the input, but get separeted into single colored object in the output
