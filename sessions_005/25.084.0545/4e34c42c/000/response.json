The transformation seems to focus on specific regions within the input grid, extracting and rearranging them to form the output grid. There's a clear emphasis on connected components (objects) of the same color and their relative positions. The background color seems to be less important (value '8' in first example, and '4' in the second). The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids. It appears that parts of the image get removed, especially background area, and the rest of the objects gets restructured.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n"

Consider these as individual objects.\n2.  **Locate a Multi-color Object:** In the first example, find the object that contains colors 9, 1, 2, 3, and 4. In the second, the object contains 1,2,3,5,6 and 8.\n3.  **Extract Sub-Objects, Top Row First:** Split the multicolor object into objects, each with a single color, starting from the top of the multi-colored object. If there are any pixels of the same color as the topmost row of the object, to the left of this object, take them as well, and place them on the top row of the output.\n4. **Place Second Layer:** The next layers in the new picture consist of all colors present in the multi-colored object, each on its separate line.\n5. **Reconstruct Object in Output:** For each remaining line, extract a line with all the other colors present in the multicolor object, in same configuration as they were originally.\n6. **Discard the Rest:** All other objects that are not connected in any way, are ignored.\n\nIn essence, the transformation identifies a complex, multi-colored object, extracts single-color sub-objects from it, and arranges these sub-objects into a new, smaller grid, discarding the rest of the input.\n"
