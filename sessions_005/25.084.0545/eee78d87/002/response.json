            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, which it clearly doesn't generalize well to the other examples. The core issues are:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Checkerboard Pattern:** The checkerboard isn't just 0s and 7s. It seems more nuanced and dependent on the input. The initial attempt was a simple alternating pattern, which is wrong.\n2.  **Incorrect Cross Pattern:** The code creates cross where original grid is placed, however, from the looks of outputs it is not desired.\n3.  **Misunderstanding of Embedding:** The embedding logic seems overly complex and doesn't accurately reflect how the input grid is incorporated into the output. The cross logic significantly distorts the expected output.\n4. **Incorrect Replacement rule**: All the values other than 7s are replaces with 9s, however, only the colored pixels that are not 7 should have been replaced by 9.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Checkerboard:** We need to determine the *actual* rule for the background pattern. It's likely related to the position of the input grid and possibly some modulo operation.\n2. **Remove Cross Pattern**: The cross logic should be entirely removed.\n3.  **Simplify Embedding:** Focus on correctly placing the input grid within the output, centered.\n4.  **Conditional Replacement:** Only replace non-7 pixels *within the embedded input* with 9.\n5. **Output size**: Output grid size is fixed to 16x16\n\n**Gather Metrics and Evidence:**\n\nLet's use the provided examples to understand dimensions and calculate key center values.\n\n"
