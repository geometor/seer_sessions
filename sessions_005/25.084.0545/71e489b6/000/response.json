There appear to be two main colors present most of the time: blue (1) and white(0).\n*   **Output Grids:** The output grids have similar dimensions to the input grids. However, orange(7) is a new color that appeared in the grid that wasn't in the input.\n*   **Objects:** potential objects could be contiguous blocks of the same color and the whole input grid could also be considered an object.\n*    **Transformation**: It looks like some of the blue(1) pixels surrounding or near white(0) pixels are changing to orange(7).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

I say \"some\" as in the case of train\\_3, not all possible 1's become 7, specifically the center-most 1's touching the 0's.\n4.  \"Border\" is defined by looking at train\\_2, where there is a big white(0) shape in the input. The 1s directly adjacent to the shape do not all turn into 7s, but the ones that do turn into 7s form an outline around the 0 shape.\n5. There needs to be some \"contiguous\" component, as per train\\_1, the bottom right 1 doesn't turn into a 7, and neither does the top left 1, even though they are near 0's.\n\n"
