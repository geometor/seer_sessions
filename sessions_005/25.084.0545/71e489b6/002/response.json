            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program was on the right track, identifying the relationship between blue (1) and white (0) pixels and attempting to change some blue pixels to orange (7). However, the logic for determining *which* blue pixels to change was flawed and overly broad. It incorrectly changed too many blue pixels to orange. The core issue is the condition for changing a blue pixel to orange needs to be more precise and refined. The rule should be more conservative.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze the differences between the \"Transformed Output\" and the \"Expected Output\" in each example. Focus on where the code *incorrectly* changed a blue pixel and, conversely, where it *correctly* left a blue pixel unchanged.\n\n2.  **Refine the Neighbor Condition:** The existing neighbor check is too simple. The problem seems to only change to orange the blue that forms a single line adjacent to white. We need to improve the accuracy of determining the adjacency.\n\n3.  **Consider Edge Cases:** Look at how the transformation behaves at corners, edges, and with different arrangements of blue and white pixels.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (using manual review of the output and visualising):**\n\nI will perform a visual and manual analysis since I cannot directly execute code yet in this current turn. I'll create detailed notes, and then summarize them in YAML. I'll focus on where differences occur in the predicted and expected outputs for each example.\n\n**Example 1 Notes:**\n\n*   The large block in top left is incorrect. Many interior blue became orange.\n*   Bottom left corner is incorrect.\n*   The \"L\" shape near bottom is incorrect.\n*   The algorithm is too aggressive at changing interior blue to orange, inside shapes.\n\n**Example 2 Notes:**\n\n*    The center vertical columns of orange is wider in the incorrect output.\n*    Again, the output incorrectly makes shapes thicker.\n\n**Example 3 Notes:**\n\n*   Many changes in the center. The single line became thick and the border of the outline is not correct, and became 2 pixels thick at some places.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

This means checking to see how many orange neighbors this blue pixel already has, and potentially, checking how many blue neighbors *those* neighbors have, to avoid \"thickening\" existing orange regions that may have been set previously.\n    *   **Color Change:** If *all* the above conditions are met, change the pixel's color from blue (1) to orange (7).\n4.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.\n\nThe key improvement is the \"Outline Check\", ensuring we only draw single-pixel-width outlines and avoid changing interior blue pixels or making the outline too thick. This requires a much more nuanced check.\n"
