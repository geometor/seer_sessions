Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output examples to discern the underlying transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grids:** The input consists of 2D grids of varying sizes, filled with single-digit integers (0-9), which represent different colors. There appear to be two main colors present most of the time: blue (1) and white(0).
*   **Output Grids:** The output grids have similar dimensions to the input grids. However, orange(7) is a new color that appeared in the grid that wasn't in the input.
*   **Objects:** potential objects could be contiguous blocks of the same color and the whole input grid could also be considered an object.
*    **Transformation**: It looks like some of the blue(1) pixels surrounding or near white(0) pixels are changing to orange(7).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1] # white, blue and rarely others
      - shape: 2D array

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1, 7] # White, Blue, Orange
      - shape: 2D array

  - action: color_change
    description: "Change color of some pixels, specifically from blue(1) to orange(7)."
    trigger: "Proximity to white(0) pixels."

  - relationship: proximity
    between: [blue_pixel, white_pixel]
    property: adjacent
    description: "Blue pixels adjacent to, or nearly adjacent to, white pixels are candidates for color change."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Consider the entire input grid as a single object, and individual pixels as sub-objects.
2.  **Locate Target Pixels:** Scan the input grid to identify blue (1) pixels that are directly adjacent to (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or are on the "border" of a group of white (0) pixels.
3.  **Apply Transformation:** Change some of the located blue pixels to orange (7). I say "some" as in the case of train\_3, not all possible 1's become 7, specifically the center-most 1's touching the 0's.
4.  "Border" is defined by looking at train\_2, where there is a big white(0) shape in the input. The 1s directly adjacent to the shape do not all turn into 7s, but the ones that do turn into 7s form an outline around the 0 shape.
5. There needs to be some "contiguous" component, as per train\_1, the bottom right 1 doesn't turn into a 7, and neither does the top left 1, even though they are near 0's.
