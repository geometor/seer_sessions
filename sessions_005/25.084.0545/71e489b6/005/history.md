Okay, let's analyze the provided information and formulate a revised natural language program and supporting data.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and generated code focused on outlining white shapes with a one-pixel-thick orange border. However, the results on the provided examples show inconsistencies. The code sometimes adds orange to the interior of shapes, creates outlines that are too thick, or misses adding outlines entirely. The main issue appears to be the over-application of the orange outline based on a simple adjacency check. The program needs to better distinguish between *intended* exterior outlines and internal blue pixels that happen to be next to white pixels. It also has to respect some constraints implicit with outlines, mainly that an outline can't thicken itself and the orange border can't merge.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Errors:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example. Identify specific pixel locations where the code produced incorrect results.
2.  **Refine Adjacency Rules:** The current code simply checks for white neighbors. We need to be more precise about *where* the orange pixels should go. Consider the configuration of blue and white, looking for "edges" of white shapes.
3.  **Prevent Outline Thickening:** Implement a strict rule that prevents adding orange pixels if they would create a 2x2 or larger block of orange. This addresses the "thickening" issue observed in the examples.
4.  **Consider Enclosed White Areas**: Example 3 has inner parts of the white that are "enclosed" so they should not be outlined.
5.  **Iterative Refinement:** Adjust the natural language program and, subsequently, the code based on these observations.

**Metrics and Observations using code execution:**

Since the question doesn't require calculations, I can proceed directly to gather facts and build natural language program.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The primary transformation involves adding an orange outline around white shapes.
  - object: White shapes
    properties:
      - color: White (0)
      - description: Contiguous regions of white pixels.
      - interaction: |
        Act as the base for the orange outline. Areas fully surrounded should
        not be outlined.
  - object: Blue regions
    properties:
      - color: Blue (1)
      - description: Contiguous regions of non-white, non-orange pixels.
      - interaction: |
          Determine where the orange outline is placed, specifically at the boundary with white shapes.
  - object: Orange outline
    properties:
      - color: Orange (7)
      - description: A one-pixel-wide border around white shapes.
      - constraint: Cannot be thicker than one pixel.
      - constraint: Never surrounds white shapes enclosed on all sides.
  - action: Outline creation
    description: |
        Blue pixels adjacent to white pixels are changed to orange, but only if:
          1. The blue pixel is adjacent to a white pixel.
          2. Adding the orange pixel does not create a 2x2 or thicker block of orange.
          3. The adjacent white area is not fully enclosed by other colors (blue
             or orange).
  - example_1_issue: |
      The transformation incorrectly outlines some internal blue regions and creates thick outlines.
  - example_2_issue: |
      The transformation incorrectly outlines some internal blue regions, creates thick outlines in the top area, and leaves a blue pixel adjacent to white at the bottom.
  - example_3_issue: |
        The transformation wrongly places the orange borders inside of the
        intended white areas, it leaves adjacent blue, and it creates thick borders.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify White Shapes:** Locate all contiguous regions of white (0) pixels. These are the shapes to be outlined.
2.  **Identify Potential Outline Pixels:** Find all blue (1) pixels that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right, not diagonal, this is called 4-connected) to a white pixel.
3.  **Filter Outline Pixels:** For each potential outline pixel:
    *   Check if changing the pixel to orange (7) would create a 2x2 or larger block of orange pixels. If so, *do not* change the pixel.
    *   Check if the adjacent white shape is completely surrounded. If so, *do not* change the pixel.
    *   If a potential outline pixel passes check 3, check if it is next to an orange neighbor. If so, examine the orange pixel's neighbors and do not convert to orange if *it* is next to yet *another* orange pixel.
4.  **Apply Transformation:** Change the remaining potential outline pixels (those that passed the checks) to orange (7).
