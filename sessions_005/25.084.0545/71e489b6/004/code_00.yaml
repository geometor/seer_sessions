facts:
  - observation: |
      The primary transformation involves adding an orange outline around white shapes.
  - object: White shapes
    properties:
      - color: White (0)
      - description: Contiguous regions of white pixels.
      - interaction: |
        Act as the base for the orange outline. Areas fully surrounded should
        not be outlined.
  - object: Blue regions
    properties:
      - color: Blue (1)
      - description: Contiguous regions of non-white, non-orange pixels.
      - interaction: |
          Determine where the orange outline is placed, specifically at the boundary with white shapes.
  - object: Orange outline
    properties:
      - color: Orange (7)
      - description: A one-pixel-wide border around white shapes.
      - constraint: Cannot be thicker than one pixel.
      - constraint: Never surrounds white shapes enclosed on all sides.
  - action: Outline creation
    description: |
        Blue pixels adjacent to white pixels are changed to orange, but only if:
          1. The blue pixel is adjacent to a white pixel.
          2. Adding the orange pixel does not create a 2x2 or thicker block of orange.
          3. The adjacent white area is not fully enclosed by other colors (blue
             or orange).
  - example_1_issue: |
      The transformation incorrectly outlines some internal blue regions and creates thick outlines.
  - example_2_issue: |
      The transformation incorrectly outlines some internal blue regions, creates thick outlines in the top area, and leaves a blue pixel adjacent to white at the bottom.
  - example_3_issue: |
        The transformation wrongly places the orange borders inside of the
        intended white areas, it leaves adjacent blue, and it creates thick borders.
