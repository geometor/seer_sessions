Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a refined natural language program and a YAML block documenting the observations:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code has several issues, leading to incorrect transformations in all three examples. The core problems revolve around correctly handling:

1.  **Alternating Colors:** The alternation logic isn't consistently applied, particularly when objects are not contiguous to the divider. It sometimes replaces all cells to the right with an incorrect repeating pattern and doesn't always use '0' correctly.
2.  **Object Contiguity:** The contiguous condition ( `end_col == vertical_line_col` ) works, but the code uses `input_grid` instead of output grid to check subsequent colors.
3. **Missing 0s in Output**: In some instances, the correct alternating sequence should include 0, but the program is failing to output it, or inserting wrong colors.

The strategy to resolve these errors involves:

*   **Refine Alternation Logic:** Create consistent alternation that correctly selects between the object's color, '0', and a color from right of the divisor.
*   **Correct Contiguity Handling:** Use `output_grid` instead of `input_grid`.
*   **YAML Facts:** Develop a comprehensive YAML representation of objects, their properties (color, position, contiguity), and the transformation rules.
*   **Iterative Testing:** Test the updated code after each significant change to ensure it's moving in the right direction.

**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis)**

Since the code is provided and I can analyze it and its output, I'll use manual inspection and deduction rather than `tool_code` for the metrics at this stage.  `tool_code` would be more valuable if I was blind to the implementation.

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** A vertical line of '2's. Horizontal lines of colors 1, 6, 3, and 5 to the left.
*   **Expected Output:**  Alternating colors to the right of the divider, based on contiguity.
*   **Actual Output:** Incorrect alternation.
    *   Row with '1's: Should alternate 1, 0.  Output is all 1s.
    *   Row with '6's: Should be all 8, but the output shows the alternating color, 0.
    *   Row with '3's: Should alternate 3, 0, but some are skipped.
    *   Row with '5's: Should alternate 5, 0, but some are skipped.
*   **Issue:** The object touching vertical line is not using the correct pattern.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** Vertical line of '2's. Horizontal lines including a gap (row with 2, 1, 1).
*   **Expected Output:**  Alternating colors. In row 4 should alternate 1 and 2 because color 2 is right of divider.
*   **Actual Output:** Row 4 is filled with the divider color.
*   **Issue:** The row with "2 1 1" object is not alternating with the color that is inmediately to the right of the divider.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** Vertical line of '2's.  Horizontal lines to the left.
*   **Expected Output:** Alternation to the right of the divider.
*   **Actual Output:** Incorrent alternation.
*   **Issue:** Same as previous ones, but with smaller grids.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Find the Divider:** Identify the vertical line composed entirely of '2's.  Note its column position.

2.  **Identify Horizontal Objects:** For each row, find contiguous horizontal sequences of non-zero pixels to the *left* of the divider.  Each object is defined by its row, starting column, ending column, and color.

3.  **Transform Each Row:**
    *   Iterate through each row in the input grid.
    *   If a horizontal object exists in the current row:
        *   Keep the original object unchanged to the left of the divider.
        *   If object is contiguous to divider.
            -  Starting from the cell immediately to the right of the divider, alternate filling cells with the object's color and '0'.
        *    If it is not contiguous:
             -   Get the color of the cell immediately to the right of the divider in the *same* row.
             - Alternate cells between the color *to the right of the divider* and the object *color*.
    *   If no horizontal object exists in the current row, leave the row unchanged.
