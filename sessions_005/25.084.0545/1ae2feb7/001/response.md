"""
This program transforms an input grid based on horizontal objects found to the left of a vertical line of '2's. The transformation involves extending each horizontal object to the right, creating an alternating pattern of the object's color and '0' (empty cells).

1.  **Identify the Divider:** Locate the vertical line of '2's. This line remains unchanged in the output.
2.  **Locate Objects:** Find all horizontal lines made of cells with the same color to the left of the identified vertical line.
3.  **Iterate Objects:** Iterate through the rows that contains objects found in the previous step.
4.  **Apply Transformation:** For each horizontal object:
    *   Fill the original object cells with their initial color.
    *   Starting in the column immediately to the right of the vertical '2' line, fill the current column with object color.
    *   Skip one column.
    *   Fill the next column with object color
    *   Continue alternating filling object color and skipping one cell to the end of line.
    *   Fill the remaining cell with color 0.
