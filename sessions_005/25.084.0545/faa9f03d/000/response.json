The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation appears to involve some form of color replacement or modification, influenced by the surrounding pixels, particularly horizontal and vertical neighbors, and possibly with the type of the color playing a significant role. There are different colors in different inputs.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts**\n\n"
