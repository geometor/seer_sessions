facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 16x16
      - color_palette: [0, 1, 2, 7, 9]
    observations:
      - "Color 7 appears to be a background or separator."
      - "Changes occur in regions surrounded by or adjacent to color 7."

  - object: color_block_9
    properties:
      - color: 9
      - shape: variable
    actions:
      - changes_to: 1
        conditions: "When at specific coordinates like (9, 7) in Example 1"
      - retains_color: "true"
        conditions: "When adjacent to another color 9 within radius=2"
    observations:
     - "Isolated 9s or those near the border defined by color 7 can change color based on their positions"

  - object: color_block_0
    properties:
      - color: 0
      - shape: variable
    actions:
      - changes_to: 9
        conditions: "When not vertically adjacent to color 7"
    observations:
     -  "The change of color 0 seems to relate to its adjacent pixels, the change is prevented by the 'wall' of 7"

  - object: color_block_2
    properties:
      - color: 2
      - shape: variable, often in pairs or lines
    actions:
      - changes_to: 9
        conditions: "When directly below a row of color 7, and the row above that is also color 7."

    observations:
      - "The change is conditioned on a specific arrangement relative to 7 above it"

  - object: color_block_7
    properties:
      - color: 7
      - shape: "Forms the background and often outlines regions."
    actions:
     - remains_unchanged: True
    observations:
     - "acts a boundary and conditions for transformation of the other colors"
