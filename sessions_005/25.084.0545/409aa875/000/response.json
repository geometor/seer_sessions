It's not a simple global transformation (like inverting all colors).\n*    In train_1, some 9's are unchanged, one is changed to a 1.\n*    In train_2, some 0's are unchanged, some are changed to 9. Some rows are unchanged.\n*     In train_3, some of the 2s are changed to 9.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"

Output: the changed matrix\n\nThe core of the transformation is a *context-sensitive* replacement. The program doesn't just say \"change all 9s to 1s.\" It checks the *location* and *neighborhood* of the pixel before deciding whether and how to change it. The rules discovered across train_1, train_2 and train_3 provide evidence for context-sensitive rule determination.\n"
