            "text": "Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output pairs and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task, focusing on perception, object identification, and the development of a natural language program:\n\n**Perception of Elements**\n\n1.  **Grids:** Both input and output are rectangular grids of the same dimensions (18x18).\n2.  **Colors:** The grids contain pixels of various colors, represented by integers (0-9). The background color is consistent within each grid, but may change between examples (4 in the first, 3 in the second).\n3.  **Objects:**  Contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color can be considered objects. These vary in size and shape. Some are single pixels, others are larger clusters.\n4. **Change Detection:** The core of the task is figuring out *which* pixels change color, and *why*.\n5. **Spatial Relationships**: The transformation is very sensitive to the exact row and column position.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"

The background color is maintained throughout.\n"
