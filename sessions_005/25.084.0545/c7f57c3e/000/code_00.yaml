facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - observation: The grids consist of pixels, each with a color value (0-9).
  - observation: Objects are formed by contiguous blocks of same-colored pixels.
  - observation: The transformation involves changing the color of specific pixels.
  - observation: Some single pixel sized objects do not change.
  - observation: Some 2x2 sized objects of uniform color do not change.
  - observation: in the first example, a group of 3 green pixels swaps with a group of 3 gray pixels of the same shape
  - observation: in the second example, a group of 2 yellow pixels is swapped with a single magenta pixel.
  - observation: The background color does not change.
  - hypothesis: The transformation rule swaps groups of pixels of at least 3x1, 1x3 or 3x3 in size.
  - hypothesis: Swapped pixel groups are always on the right side of a 3x3, 3x1, 1x3 uniform color group.
