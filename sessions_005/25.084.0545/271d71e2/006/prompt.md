"""
1.  **Object Identification:** Identify all contiguous objects in the input grid. An object is a group of adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right - no diagonals) with the same color.

2.  **Maroon Movement:** Identify all maroon (color 9) objects. Move each maroon object up by one row. If a maroon object is already at the top row, it stays in place.

3.  **Interaction Check:** For each grey (color 5) object, check if any of its pixels are directly below any of the new positions of the maroon pixels.

4.  **Conditional Transformation:** If a grey pixel is directly below a new maroon pixel position, change that grey pixel's color to orange (color 7).

5. **Output Construction** Create an output grid. All maroon objects are moved, any grey objects that had pixels directly below any of the moved maroon object pixels are changed to orange. All other pixels remain unchanged.
