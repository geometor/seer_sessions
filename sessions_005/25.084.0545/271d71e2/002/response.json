            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code have fundamental flaws in how they handle object interactions and movement. The core issue is that the code doesn't correctly implement the \"move maroon (9) up and interact\" logic. It seems to be moving parts of the maroon object in some cases, but leaving others and not properly assessing changes to objects adjacent to the *original* maroon object's *previous* position. The code also has some redundant/overlapping conditions. The strategy needs to focus on *where* the maroon objects *would be* if they moved up one row and *then* check for interactions, not checking for interactions and moving things around in a piecemeal fashion.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Correct Maroon Movement:** Instead of directly modifying the `output_grid` based on the *current* position of maroon pixels, we should first determine the *new* positions of all maroon pixels (if they were to move up one row). Store these potential new positions.\n2.  **Adjacency Based on *New* Maroon Positions:** Iterate through other objects and check for adjacency to the *potential new* positions of the maroon pixels, *not* their original positions.\n3.  **Simplify Conditional Logic:** The current code has multiple, sometimes redundant, checks for color 9. Consolidate the logic.\n4. **Handle Other Pixels:** make sure to handle the other pixels not related to the 9's or the interaction correctly.\n5.  **Object Tracking, Not Just Pixels:** Ensure the `find_objects` function is correctly identifying contiguous blocks. The interaction logic must work at the object level.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection for now, will use code for verification later):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Maroon (9) objects partially move up, leaving parts behind.\n    *   The grey (5) object correctly transforms to orange (7) in *some* places but not all.\n    *   Bottom row is filled with sixes, but should be empty.\n    *   A nine remains in it's original position.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Maroon objects are moved up seemingly at random.\n    *   The grey to orange transformation does not work consistently\n    *   There is a lot of errant zero placement.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Some maroons correctly go up a row, but some do not.\n    *   The grey objects are not handled at all.\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n\n"
