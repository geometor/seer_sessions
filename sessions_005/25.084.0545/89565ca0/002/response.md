Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a strategy to improve the transformation rule.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code are based on the idea of identifying colors that form large blocks spanning the full width of the input grid. However, the results clearly show that this approach is incorrect. The code fails to produce the correct output for all three examples. The expected outputs have varying heights and widths and often include colors that don't span the entire width of the input grid. It seems that the transformation is looking at specific rows, that form a pattern, maybe sorting and extracting. The size of output is constant (width = 4) in all training examples, but not obvious how the height is determined.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze all input-output pairs to identify common patterns and relationships. We need to move beyond the initial "full-width" assumption. Pay close attention to relative positions of colored blocks.
2.  **Focus on Row Relationships:** Instead of looking for full-width blocks, consider relationships *between* rows. Are there dominant colors that appear in significant portions of the input, and how do they relate to the output?
3.  **Output Structure:** Investigate the structure of the output grids. The outputs consistently have a width of 4. Determine how the height of the output grid is determined and the colors are selected.
4. **Consider sorting or other operations**: The transformation may involve extracting those unique colors and representing them in the output.

**Gather Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis for this step, as code execution isn't directly applicable to all observation types):**

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** 28x22 grid. Colors present: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5.
*   **Output:** 3x4 grid. Colors present: 1, 2, 3, 5
*   **Observations:**
    *   Output contains colors that appear as substantial horizontal lines, *but not necessarily full-width*.
    *   Color '1' is not full-width, but Color '3' appear in large horizontal sections.
    * Color 2 spans as a full-width block.
* The expected output colors correspond to unique colors found in rows of input that are full-width.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** 28x22 grid. Colors present: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8.
*   **Output:** 5x4 grid. Colors present: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 5.
*   **Observations:**
    * Output contains some colors in large horizontal segments, *but not spanning the entire width*.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** 20x22 grid. Colors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8.
*   **Output:** 4x4 grid. Colors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8.
*   **Observations:**
     *   Similar to previous examples, output features colors present in significant horizontal sections (though, again, not full-width in all cases).

**YAML Fact Identification:**


```yaml
example_1:
  input_objects:
    - colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]
      type: grid
      dimensions: [28, 22]
  output_objects:
    - colors: [1, 3, 2, 5]
      type: grid
      dimensions: [3, 4]
  transformations:
    - Find full-width rows in input
    - Extract unique colors from those rows.
    - Create output rows with extracted colors repeated four times.

example_2:
  input_objects:
    - colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
      type: grid
      dimensions: [28, 22]
  output_objects:
    - colors: [1, 2, 4, 3, 8, 5]
      type: grid
      dimensions: [5, 4]
  transformations:
    - Find full-width rows in input
    - Extract unique colors from those rows.
    - Create output rows with extracted colors repeated four times.

example_3:
  input_objects:
    - colors: [0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8]
      type: grid
      dimensions: [20, 22]
  output_objects:
    - colors: [1, 2, 4, 8, 7]
      type: grid
      dimensions: [4, 4]
  transformations:
    - Find full-width rows in input
    - Extract unique colors from those rows.
    - Create output rows with extracted colors repeated four times.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
2.  Identify rows which are composed of a single color that spans the complete width of the grid
3.  Extract the unique colors from those rows
4.  For each extracted unique color, create a new row in the output grid.
5.  Each row of output grid should contains the unique color repeated four times.
