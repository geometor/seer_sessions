facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids are large and contain various colored objects.
  - observation: |
      Output grids are small (all outputs are 4 columns wide) and contain a subset of colors from the input.
  - observation: |
      Colors in the output grid seem to represent significant color regions in the input.
  - observation: |
     The height of output grid appears related to the number of distinct contiguous horizontal color blocks running the width of the input grid.
  - observation: |
     Output grids appear to be a summary, preserving the vertical order of distinct color blocks.
  - observation: |
      Colors surrounded by other colors are not in output, with the exception of colors that appear in other output rows.
  - observation: |
    If a color in the input takes up the entire width of the grid, it is included in the output.
  - object: InputGrid
    properties:
      - Large, rectangular grid of pixels.
      - Contains multiple colors (0-9).
  - object: OutputGrid
    properties:
      - Small, rectangular grid of pixels.
      - Contains a subset of colors from the InputGrid.
      - 4 columns wide.
  - relationship: |
      OutputGrid is a summarized representation of the InputGrid.
  - action: Summarization
    description: |
      The input grid is summarized by identifying the colors that form large blocks that cover the full width.
