            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program was based on the first training example, and it's clear it doesn't generalize well to the other examples. The core idea of splitting the grid based on horizontal lines of '6's and reversing the order of segments is partially correct, but there are issues with how the segments are handled and combined, especially when multiple '6' lines, or no '6' lines are present. The height seems to be calculated incorrectly sometimes, and example 2 shows that there is padding and alignment needed for different segment sizes.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Padding and Alignment:** The output segments must be aligned correctly. The provided code includes padding, and this needs to be maintained.\n2.  **Multiple/No Divider Lines:** Handle cases with multiple divider lines (example 1) and cases with zero divider lines (example 3).\n3.   **Stacking Segments:** Ensure proper order of segments in the output\n\n**Gather Metrics (using manual analysis and referencing code outputs):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (11, 11)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (23, 5)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (10, 11)\n    *   Divider Lines (rows of 6s): 1 (at row 5)\n    *   Number of Segments: 2\n    *  Issue: The output shape, and how to combine segments are incorrect.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (18, 5)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (5, 17)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (15, 5)\n    *   Divider Lines: 2 (at rows 5 and 11)\n    *   Number of segments: 3\n    *   Issue: Segments need to be stacked horizontally with separators. The width of the segments is not being considered to pad the final output.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 17)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (17, 5)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (5, 17)\n    *    Divider lines: 0\n    *    Number of segments:1\n    *    Issue: The input should be transposed based on the divider lines\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
