Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of digits, representing colors.
*   There are distinct regions or "objects" of uniform color in both input and output grids.
*   The output grid seems to have a reduced size in some cases, or maintains size, but the color distribution seems changed in different parts
*   The layout of the output appears to maintain, or invert the outside border/frame when comparing the dimensions between input/output

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids consist of single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - objects:
      - name: frame
        description: The border cells.
        properties:
          - color: Variable, can be any of the digits/colors.
          - location: all outside edges of the input
      - name: inside_cluster
        description: area inside of frame on all edges, possibly containing multiple other object clusters
        properties:
          - location: inside frame
          - composition: made up of different objects, arranged in different ways
  - actions:
    - name: Select frame
      description: find location of frame and change contents
    - name: invert
      description: transpose location of objects

  - relationships:
      - input and output grids have different dimensions based on removal, and repositioning of frame
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the "frame"**: The frame is composed of the outermost rows and columns in the input grid. It can be any color.

2. **Identify inside Clusters**: Find all clusters/objects inside the frame

3.  **Invert location**: transpose frame and inside clusters - if input frame is along the x and y axis, it is only along the x axis in the output, with the contents displayed to it's side, preserving order of the rows, and the contents of each cluster rotated -90 degrees, and their order preserved and presented based on the order on the input grid

Let's refine this with more precise language, preparing for the coding phase.

**Revised Natural Language Program:**
1. **Identify Frame:** Find the values and locations of the border of the input image.
2. **Identify inside Clusters:** Find all clusters/objects inside the frame
3.  **Invert location**: transpose frame and inside clusters - if input frame is along the x and y axis, it is only along the x axis in the output, with the contents displayed to it's side, preserving order of the rows, and the contents of each cluster rotated -90 degrees, and their order preserved and presented based on the order on the input grid
