            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the `transform` function on the provided examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code have significant flaws. The core idea of identifying a frame and inner objects is partially correct, but the implementation of how these objects are rearranged in the output is incorrect. The output grid's dimensions and the placement of elements within it are not aligned with the expected outputs. The concept of \"inverting location\" is misinterpreted. The attempt to rotate elements of inner objects by -90 degrees has not materialized in the code.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze the relationship between the input and output grids in both examples. Pay close attention to *all* the objects present, their colors, and their relative positions.\n2.  **Dimension Calculation:** The way output grid dimensions are calculated is incorrect. We must derive a rule-based method to determine the output grid's size based on the input.\n3.  **Object Placement:** The placement logic is completely off. We need to establish a clear rule for where each object from the input grid is placed in the output grid.\n4.  **Object Representation:** Identify objects, their colors, sizes, and shapes.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example 1):**\n\n"
