example_1:
  input_grid_shape: [15, 15]
  output_grid_shape: [15, 7]
  input_objects:
    - color: 9  # Frame
      count: 2
    - color: 4  # Frame
      count: 2
    - color: 8  # Inside
      count: 1
    - color: 3  # Inside
      count: 1
    - color: 1  # Inside
      count: 1
    - color: 5  # Inside
      count: 2
    - color: 7  # Inside
      count: 1
    - color: 0 # Inside
      count: 1
  output_objects:
     - color: 9 # Outer Frame
       count: 2
     - color: 8  # Inside
       count: 1
     - color: 3  # Inside
       count: 1
     - color: 0  # Inside
       count: 1
     - color: 1  # Inside
       count: 1
     - color: 5  # Inside
       count: 2
     - color: 7  # Inside
       count: 1
  transformation:
    - The output grid height is the same as the input grid
    - The output grid presents the 'inside' clusters/objects to the side of the frame, preserving order of appearance in the input grid, top to bottom.
    - The frame is reduced to a single vertical line in the output.

  transformation:
    - The output grid width is the same as the input.
    - The output grid presents the 'inside' clusters/objects to the side of the frame, preserving order of appearance in the input grid, top to bottom, left to right.
    - The frame is reduced to a single horizontal line at the top of the output grid.
