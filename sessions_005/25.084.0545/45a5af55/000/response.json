The transformation seems to involve expanding the input grid and overlaying a mirrored and padded version of the input onto a larger canvas. The padding appears to use the color azure (8). There's a definite sense of symmetry and mirroring in the output. Rows are added, and potentially stretched, with a reflection plane potentially lying in the middle of the rows and columns of the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
