objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (representing colors)
  - name: pixel
    type: element of grid
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      row: integer
      col: integer
      neighbors: list of pixels

actions:
  - name: transform_color
    input: pixel, color
    output: changes pixel color to the specified color
    conditions:
      - if pixel.color is 8 and any orthogonal neighbor.color is 6, change to 7
      - if pixel.color is 8 and pixel to the left.color is 1, change to 7
      - if pixel.color is 1 and any orthogonal neighbor.color was 8 and is now 7, change to 7
