The conversion rule in these locations depend on their relative x coordinate to the adjacent 1.\n4. The color 1s (blue) stay the same except when adjacent to an 8 which gets converted to a 7 in which case the 1 also converts to a 7.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, row, col):\n    \"\"\"Gets the valid neighbors of a cell in a grid.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                continue\n            r, c = row + dr, col + dc\n            if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols:\n                neighbors.append((r, c))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output grid with a copy of the input grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = output_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n            # Change 8s adjacent to 6s to 7s\n            if output_grid[row, col] == 6:\n                neighbors = get_neighbors(output_grid, row, col)\n                for r, c in neighbors:\n                    if output_grid[r, c] == 8:\n                        output_grid[r, c] = 7\n\n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n            if output_grid[row,col] == 1:\n                neighbors = get_neighbors(output_grid, row, col)\n                for r, c in neighbors:\n                    if output_grid[r,c] == 8:\n                        if c < col:\n                           output_grid[r,c] = 7\n                        \n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n             if input_grid[row,col] == 1:\n                neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid, row, col)\n                for r, c in neighbors:\n                    if input_grid[r,c] == 8 and output_grid[r,c] == 7:\n                        output_grid[row,col] = 7\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
