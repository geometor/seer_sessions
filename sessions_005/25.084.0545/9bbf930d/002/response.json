            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to improve the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a limited understanding of the transformation, focusing on copying a frame and shifting some pixels in the 7th row and column. The test results reveal significant discrepancies, indicating that the core logic of shifting pixels based on row/column index is incorrect and incomplete. The transformation is more complex than initially perceived. There's a clear pattern of '6' appearing at the boundaries and replacing '7's at specific locations. We need to revise our strategy to focus less on shifting and more on carefully placing the '6's based on a more sophisticated understanding of their positioning rule, potentially looking at relationships between the position of other elements.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example. Identify the exact locations where the '6's are incorrectly placed or missing.\n2.  **Refine Pattern Recognition:** Instead of just focusing on the 7th row/column, try to find a rule or pattern that determines *where* the '6's should be placed. This will probably *not* be a simple row/column shift. It may depend on the existing border, or it could be something more abstract. It is likely the border and the size/position of objects are the main elements.\n3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Revise the description to accurately reflect the refined pattern.\n4.  **Update Code:** Modify the `transform` function based on the new natural language program.\n5.  **Iterate:** Repeat the testing and refinement process until all training examples match.\n\n**Example Metrics and Observations:**\n\nWe'll examine color counts, sizes, and specific pixel differences.\n\n"
