The most prominent feature is the consistent presence of a \"frame\" of '6' and '7' values around the edges of both input and output grids. There appears to be a selective mirroring or copying of certain parts of the input grid to the output, particularly in the corners and along the edges. The transformation seems to affect some, but not all, internal regions of the grid, the seventh row and column seem to have a change of the color to the left and right of the seventh.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
