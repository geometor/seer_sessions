objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9)
      properties:
        rows: variable
        columns: variable
        frame:
          color_left: 6
          color_right: 7
          description: single-pixel border around grid
  - pixel:
    type: individual cell
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - copy:
      description: Duplicate a pixel or region to another location.
  - shift:
      description: Move pixel values
  - modify:
      description: change value of a pixel, if in column or row 7

relationships:
  - adjacency: Pixels are adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
  - containment: The grid contains all pixels.
  - framing: The '6' and '7' pixels form a consistent border around the grid.

transformations:
  - type: conditional copy/modification
  - description: >-
      Parts of the input grid are copied to the output grid,
      with specific modifications based on pixel position and original value, with seventh col and row changes.
