Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Task Elements**

The task involves transforming input grids of colored pixels into output grids. The transformation appears to be focused on expanding, or "filling," certain colored regions based on specific rules related to adjacency, color, and sometimes position on the input grid.

**Key Observations**:

*   **Color-Specific Transformations:** Different colors seem to trigger different transformations.
*   **Expansion/Filling:**  Regions of a single color expand, sometimes influenced by adjacent or nearby colors.
* **Occlusion:** One transformation will sometimes overwrite another.
*   **Context Sensitivity:** The rules are not simply replacing one color with another; the surrounding context matters.
*   **Irregular Shapes**: The final filled shapes are sometimes irregular - they may be constrained by other objects.

**YAML Block - Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: colored_regions
    description: Contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: Integer value representing the color (0-9).
      - shape: The geometric shape of the region.
      - position: Location within the grid (row, column).
      - adjacency: List of adjacent colored regions.

actions:
  - name: expand_region
    description: Expands a colored region based on specific rules.
    parameters:
      - color: The color of the region to expand.
      - context:  Surrounding colors and their positions.
      - constraints: stopping the expansion (other colors, edge of grid)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description:  Describes which colored regions are next to each other (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
  - type: containment
    description: after expansion - describes if a region is contained within another
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Target Colors:** Examine the input grid and note the colors that appear to be the focus of the transformation. These are often colors that either get replaced or expand significantly. Look for which color is used in the expansion.

2.  **Locate Anchor Regions**: Find the location in the grid where a transform originates.

3.  **Determine the Extent of Expansion:** Expand the anchor region, replacing colors in the target's path.

4.  **Establish Expansion Rules:** Note:
    *   Which colors are replaced?
    *   Which colors block the expansion?
    *   Is the expansion horizontal, vertical, or both?
    *   Does adjacency to certain colors trigger or modify the expansion?

5.  **Repeat for all Anchor Regions:** if there are multiple regions of the same color, is the transform local or global?

6.  **Final Composition:** Combine the transformed regions to produce the final output grid. Any details, such as a specific row or column that are unchanged should be noted.

**Example Specific Notes (Applying the program to the examples):**

*   **Example 1 & 2**: The transform seems to locate an anchor color, and a target color. The anchor expands, overwriting the target.
*   **Example 3**: Anchor colors are 4, and later 6, that get expanded to a box, overwriting 9.
*    **Example 4:** There seem to be 2 passes. Anchor color 3 expands in the upper section. Then color 7 expands in the lower section.

I'm ready for the next step in the process.
