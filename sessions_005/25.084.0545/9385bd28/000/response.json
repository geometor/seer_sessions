The transformation appears to be focused on expanding, or \"filling,\" certain colored regions based on specific rules related to adjacency, color, and sometimes position on the input grid.\n\n**Key Observations**:\n\n*   **Color-Specific Transformations:** Different colors seem to trigger different transformations.\n*   **Expansion/Filling:**  Regions of a single color expand, sometimes influenced by adjacent or nearby colors.\n* **Occlusion:** One transformation will sometimes overwrite another.\n*   **Context Sensitivity:** The rules are not simply replacing one color with another; the surrounding context matters.\n*   **Irregular Shapes**: The final filled shapes are sometimes irregular - they may be constrained by other objects.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts**\n\n"

These are often colors that either get replaced or expand significantly. Look for which color is used in the expansion.\n\n2.  **Locate Anchor Regions**: Find the location in the grid where a transform originates.\n\n3.  **Determine the Extent of Expansion:** Expand the anchor region, replacing colors in the target's path.\n\n4.  **Establish Expansion Rules:** Note:\n    *   Which colors are replaced?\n    *   Which colors block the expansion?\n    *   Is the expansion horizontal, vertical, or both?\n    *   Does adjacency to certain colors trigger or modify the expansion?\n\n5.  **Repeat for all Anchor Regions:** if there are multiple regions of the same color, is the transform local or global?\n\n6.  **Final Composition:** Combine the transformed regions to produce the final output grid. Any details, such as a specific row or column that are unchanged should be noted.\n\n**Example Specific Notes (Applying the program to the examples):**\n\n*   **Example 1 & 2**: The transform seems to locate an anchor color, and a target color. The anchor expands, overwriting the target.\n*   **Example 3**: Anchor colors are 4, and later 6, that get expanded to a box, overwriting 9.\n*    **Example 4:** There seem to be 2 passes. Anchor color 3 expands in the upper section. Then color 7 expands in the lower section.\n\nI'm ready for the next step in the process.\n"
