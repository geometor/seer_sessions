actions:
  - type: shift_left
    description: >
      Objects within the boundary are shifted to the left, filling empty

    constraints:
      - Movement is only horizontal (leftward).
      - Objects maintain their shape and color.
      - objects move only inside a "column" defined by gray pixels on the top and bottom

relationships:
  - boundary_contains_objects:
    description: >
      The gray boundary encloses and defines the operational area for
      the enclosed objects.
  - object_adjacency:
    description: >
      Objects are adjacent to white pixels or other colored objects,
      but do not overlap.
