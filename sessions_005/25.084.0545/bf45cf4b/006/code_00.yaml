    observations: |
      The output is generated by a repeating [3,3]
      pattern that overwrites a region of the input.
      The region that gets replaced includes all changed objects
      and the unchanged objects.
      The bottom rows of '4' remain unchanged.

    observations: |
        The output is generated by a repeating pattern.
        The input is cropped and replaced from top-left, 
        and the cropped size is determined by changes.

    observations: |
      The output is an exact 2x scaled replication of the
      lower-right quadrant of the input.
