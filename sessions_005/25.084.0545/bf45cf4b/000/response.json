Each digit represents a color.\n*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of the same color can be considered objects. However, the transformation doesn't seem to strictly follow object boundaries in all cases.\n*   **Color Changes:** The primary transformation involves changing the colors of certain pixels. The changes aren't random; there's a discernible pattern.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** The relative positions of pixels and their colors seem crucial to the transformation. Proximity and adjacency are important.\n* **Input/Output differences:** the location of colors differs markedly between input and output examples\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation rule appears to overlay a repeating pattern of color changes onto the input grid. It isn't a simple flood fill or object-based replacement; it's more akin to a patterned \"stencil\" being applied. It is a combination of two parts:\n1. identification of an object.\n2. re-drawing of the object based upon a template.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n1.  **Identify Seed Patterns:**\n\n    *   In each input, there's a smaller, distinct color pattern that acts as a \"seed\" or \"kernel\" for the transformation.\n\n    *   In train\\_1, the seed pattern in the upper block is approximately `2 2, 2 4, 4 2`, and `8 3 8, 3 4 3, 8 3 8` in the lower block.\n\n    *   In train\\_2, the seed pattern is `1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1 1 1` in the upper block and `8 8 8, 8 2 8, 8 8 8` in the lower.\n    *   In train\\_3 it is `6 6 6, 6 1 6, 1 6 1` in the upper block and `8 9 9 8, 9 4 4 9, 9 4 4 9, 8 9 9 8` in the lower.\n2.  **Replicate and Overlay:**\n\n    *   Identify the sections of the input grids which have repeating color regions.\n    * The seed patterns appear to be the repeating region in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Color Replacement:**\n\n    *   The colors in the input grid in the identified repeating region are replaced with the corresponding color of the template.\n4. **Retain Unmatched:**\n    * colors in the input which are outside of the repeating areas are unaffected.\n\nIn essence, the algorithm identifies repeating regions and redraws them with the seed pattern. The transformation uses a 'stamping' approach of repeating patterns.\n"
