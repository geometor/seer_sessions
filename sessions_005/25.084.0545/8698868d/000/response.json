There's a noticeable reduction in both dimensions and a change in the composition of colors. Certain color blocks in the input seem to be either removed or replaced, while others are retained but potentially recolored or reduced in size. The transformation appears to focus on rectangular sub-regions within the initial grid. There is a specific order and way in how the colors are presented.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Go over the input pixel by pixel. If a color is present more than once, change the color by a distinct color. If a color is not present, and there are other colors in the region, take the next color that is unique.\n7. **Assemble Output:** Combine the four transformed quadrants to form the output grid.\n\n"
