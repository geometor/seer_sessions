observations:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D arrays of color values.
  - type: color
    description: Pixels are represented by integers 0-9, corresponding to different colors.
  - type: object
    description: Contiguous blocks of the same color can be considered objects.
  - type: transformation
    description: Output is a compressed representation of the input.
  - type: selection
    description: Only specific colors from the input are present in the output, other than 0 (background).
  - type: spatial_relationship
    description: The position of the selected colors in the output grid seems related to their relative position in a condensed version of the input grid, after collapsing many rows and potentially columns.
  - type: size_change
     description: The first dimension size of train_1 input is 20 and output is 7, train_2 sizes are 23 and 7, and train_3 are 21 and 5
