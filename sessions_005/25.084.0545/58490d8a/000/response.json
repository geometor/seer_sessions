The input grids are significantly larger than the output grids.\n*   **Colors:** The grids contain pixels of various colors, represented by single-digit integers (0-9).  Color 0 (white) is prevalent, often acting as a background. Other colors appear in distinct clusters or patterns.\n*   **Objects:**  Clusters of the same color appear to form objects, especially when they contrast with the surrounding background (color 0).\n*   **Compression:** The output grid appears to be a highly compressed representation of the input grid, retaining only a select few colors.\n*   **Sparsity:** The output is very sparse. The output contains many 0s and only shows a few colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
