Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both grids of varying dimensions. The input grids are significantly larger than the output grids.
*   **Colors:** The grids contain pixels of various colors, represented by single-digit integers (0-9).  Color 0 (white) is prevalent, often acting as a background. Other colors appear in distinct clusters or patterns.
*   **Objects:**  Clusters of the same color appear to form objects, especially when they contrast with the surrounding background (color 0).
*   **Compression:** The output grid appears to be a highly compressed representation of the input grid, retaining only a select few colors.
*   **Sparsity:** The output is very sparse. The output contains many 0s and only shows a few colors.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
observations:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D arrays of color values.
  - type: color
    description: Pixels are represented by integers 0-9, corresponding to different colors.
  - type: object
    description: Contiguous blocks of the same color can be considered objects.
  - type: transformation
    description: Output is a compressed representation of the input.
  - type: selection
    description: Only specific colors from the input are present in the output, other than 0 (background).
  - type: spatial_relationship
    description: The position of the selected colors in the output grid seems related to their relative position in a condensed version of the input grid, after collapsing many rows and potentially columns.
  - type: size_change
     description: The first dimension size of train_1 input is 20 and output is 7, train_2 sizes are 23 and 7, and train_3 are 21 and 5
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Colors:** Determine the colors present in the output grid (excluding 0, which represents the background).
2. **Scan and select**: scan the input grid and select only those colors that are the target colors.
3.  **Reduce Rows:** Group every three rows of the input grid, select the first row in each group, and put the group into a new grid.
4. **Condense and position:** Scan every section of 3 x 3 area in the first row of each row group and find the colors. Place those colored pixels into the new grid.
5.  **Output:** The resulting grid is the output.
