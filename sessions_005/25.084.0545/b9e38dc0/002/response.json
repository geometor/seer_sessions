            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe code's initial approach of identifying interior objects and propagating color changes based on the first example is partially correct. However, it fails to generalize to the other examples. The core issues seem to be:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Propagation:** The propagation logic is too simple. It only considers immediate neighbors and stops. It needs to handle cases where the color change should propagate further, potentially across multiple \"chains\" of pixels. Example 2 demonstrates this clearly, as the \"4\" color should extend more broadly.\n2.  **Incomplete Color Mapping:** The code uses a color mapping, but only for colors specifically found to change in interior object. It does not detect other changes.\n3.  The color mapping should be discovered first.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Improve Propagation:** Implement a more robust propagation algorithm. Instead of stopping at the first different-colored pixel, it should check for chains of pixels of the _original_ color and change them accordingly. It should not just look at adjacent cells but consider potentially using something like a flood-fill algorithm.\n2.  **Dynamic color mapping**: Construct a complete color mapping from all available examples in advance, looking at the pairs in their entirety.\n3.  **Prioritize Color Mapping:** The color mapping should be done *before* interior object identification and propagation. That way any color mapping that does not involve and interior object, will not affect the results.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**\n\nLet's examine color changes and grid sizes using a python tool. We need to understand the scope of color remapping.\n\n"

If a color remains unchanged, that mapping does not need to be stored.\n\n2.  **Apply Color Map:** Iterate through all cells of the input grid, replace the colors with their mapped values as determined in step 1\n\n3.  **(Modified) Interior Object Identification:**\n *   Identify \"interior objects,\" which are contiguous regions of the *same color*, not on the border of the grid.\n\n4.  **(Modified) Interior object Processing:**\n  * Check color change - check for change in color by comparing objects location in the input and output.\n  * Apply the change to the object in the working grid.\n\n5. **(Modified) Propagation:**\n    *   For each changed pixel within each interior object do:\n    *   Check adjacent cells (up, down, left, and right).\n    *   If an adjacent cell has the *original* color of the changed pixel (before color mapping), change the adjacent cell's color to the *new* color (after color mapping).\n    *   Continue this process recursively for all newly changed pixels, forming \"chains\" of color changes. This is similar to a flood-fill, but only triggered by interior object color changes and only propagating along connected components of the original color.\n\n**Key Changes and Clarifications:**\n\n*   **Color Mapping First:** The color mapping is now the very first step, applied globally before anything else. This fixes the issue with inconsistent transformations.\n*   **Recursive Propagation:**  The propagation is made recursive to handle chain reactions of color changes, essential for Example 2.\n*  **Interior object are identified after color mapping**\n\nThis revised program should be much more robust and handle all three examples correctly. The \"flood-fill\" like behavior of the propagation is crucial. The pre-emptive color mapping simplifies the logic significantly.\n"
