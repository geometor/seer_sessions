However, it fails to correctly transform the grid in several key ways:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Infill within Dominant Block:** The code only changes non-orange pixels to orange within the dominant block if they *are not* in columns 9-14. It should change *all* non-orange to orange, *except* in columns 9-14 (where they remain untouched).\n2.  **Overly Aggressive Lower Region Transformation:** The code changes *all* pixels outside columns 9-14 below the *top* of the dominant block to orange. It should be the *bottom* of the block. Also, this is not restricted to just the bottom part. The rule is related to pixels above and on the row of the lowest part of the dominant block.\n3. Does not make any changes outside of the dominant block above its bottom row.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Correct Dominant Block Infill:** Modify the inner block transformation logic to prioritize changing non-orange pixels to orange, with an exception for columns 9-14.\n2. **Refine Lower Region Transformation**: The definition of lower is below the bottom of the dominant block.\n3. **Upper Region** All pixels in the upper region need to be considered.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for verification):**\n\n"
