            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for resolving the errors.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe errors encountered are all the same: `find_blocks.<locals>.dfs() takes 3 positional arguments but 4 were given`. This indicates a problem within the nested function `dfs` inside `find_blocks`.  The error is consistent across all examples, suggesting a fundamental issue in how `dfs` is defined or called. It seems likely I've incorrectly handled the recursion or passing of the `block` argument. Before looking at examples, I need to resolve this error, as it's a fundamental flaw.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Fix `dfs`:** I will carefully examine the `dfs` function definition and calls within `find_blocks`. The issue is almost certainly related to the number of arguments.\n2. **Re-run tests:** Once the code error is resolved, I'll automatically proceed to re-running the test examples to evaluate the natural language program and identify further adjustments if necessary.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nSince the error is consistent and prevents any useful output, metrics on dimensions are not relevant until the error in the code is corrected.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts - Initial):**\n\n"
