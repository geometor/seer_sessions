            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial strategy focused on identifying contiguous blocks of '7' (orange) and converting other digits within those blocks to '7'. It also attempted to change \"isolated\" digits in the lower part of the grid to '7', excluding a specific range of columns (9-14).  The results indicate a partial understanding of the transformation, but significant discrepancies exist. The code is failing to correctly handle several aspects, leading to a high number of incorrect pixels. The strategy needs to be significantly refined in the following ways:\n\n1.  **Refine \"Inside Block\" Logic:** The current \"inside block\" determination is too simplistic. It converts *any* digit within *any* block of 7s.  It's clear from examples 2 and 3 that not all digits inside 7-blocks are changed. We must define the *type* of 7-block that causes digit conversion.\n2.  **Improve Lower Part Transformation:**  The rule for the lower part transformation is too broad.  It changes *too many* digits to 7. We need to consider connectivity and adjacency in defining \"isolated\" in this context, and perhaps the color (value) of surrounding pixels.\n3.  **Understand the Role of Columns 9-14:** The current code simply preserves digits in columns 9-14 of the bottom part. The actual role of these columns may be more complex. It may relate to object preservation rather than just location.\n4. **Object Persistence:** Consider if any objects in the input are being preserved in terms of their shape and not just their color.\n\n**Gathering Metrics and Evidence**\n\nLet's examine the bounding boxes of the '7' blocks to understand their properties. Also, examine the \"lower part\" definition.\n\n"
