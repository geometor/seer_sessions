Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for resolving the errors.

**General Assessment:**

The errors encountered are all the same: `find_blocks.<locals>.dfs() takes 3 positional arguments but 4 were given`. This indicates a problem within the nested function `dfs` inside `find_blocks`.  The error is consistent across all examples, suggesting a fundamental issue in how `dfs` is defined or called. It seems likely I've incorrectly handled the recursion or passing of the `block` argument. Before looking at examples, I need to resolve this error, as it's a fundamental flaw.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Fix `dfs`:** I will carefully examine the `dfs` function definition and calls within `find_blocks`. The issue is almost certainly related to the number of arguments.
2. **Re-run tests:** Once the code error is resolved, I'll automatically proceed to re-running the test examples to evaluate the natural language program and identify further adjustments if necessary.

**Gather Metrics:**

Since the error is consistent and prevents any useful output, metrics on dimensions are not relevant until the error in the code is corrected.

**YAML Block (Facts - Initial):**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Dominant Block:** Find the largest contiguous block of orange (7) pixels that spans the entire height of the grid (from the top row to the bottom row). This is the "dominant block".

2.  **Inner Block Transformation:** Within the dominant block's column range, change all pixels to orange, *except* for those in columns 9 to 14 (inclusive, 0-indexed).

3. **Transformation Outside Dominant Block's Columns** For all rows:
   * Change to orange any cells not in the columns that define the dominate block's width *except* for those in columns 9 to 14.

4.  **Protected Columns:** No pixels within columns 9 to 14 (0-indexed) should be modified, regardless of other rules.

I'll first correct the code and rerun tests before trying to extract any metrics.
