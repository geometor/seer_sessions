Digits outside of blocks seem to get removed in some columns, in the lower part of the output grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

In the lower part of the grid (from row index equal to or greater than the height of any '7' block that extends to the bottom edge of the grid, find the minimum such height), most of the isolated digits are changed to 7.\n5.
