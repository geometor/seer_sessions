1.  **Determine Wall Colors:**
    *   If color `3` (green) is present in the input grid, the wall colors are `8` (azure) and `3` (green).
    *   Otherwise, the wall colors are `8` (azure) and `4` (yellow).

2.  **Identify Wall Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that match the determined wall colors.

3.  **Flood Fill:**
    *   Iterate through every cell in the grid.
      * If a cell is NOT a wall pixel, change it's color to the fill color (2/red).

4.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.
