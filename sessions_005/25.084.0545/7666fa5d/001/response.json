This includes both the horizontal and vertical lines formed by this color and the diagonal color line (4/yellow in the first pair and 3/green in the second).\n\n2.  **Fill Adjacent Pixels:** For each pixel identified as part of a wall, change the color of all adjacent pixels (up, down, left, and right, but *not* diagonally) to the \"fill\" color (2/red), *unless* the adjacent pixel is also part of a wall (color 8, 4 in example 1 or 8,3 in example 2).\n\n3.  **Propagate Fill:** Continue this filling process iteratively. For each newly filled pixel (color 2/red), repeat step 2, changing the color of its adjacent pixels to 2/red, again respecting the wall boundaries.\n\n4. **Termination Condition**: Stop when no more pixels can be filled. This means no more azure (8) or other background colored pixels.\n\nIn summary, it's a region-filling algorithm where \"walls\" of a specific color define the boundaries of the regions, and a \"fill\" color propagates outwards from the walls until the entire region is filled.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_walls(grid, wall_colors):\n    \"\"\"\n    Locates the wall pixels in the grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    wall_pixels = []\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r, c] in wall_colors:\n                wall_pixels.append((r, c))\n    return wall_pixels\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, r, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gets the valid neighbors (up, down, left, right) of a pixel.\n    \"\"\"\n    neighbors = []\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    if r > 0:\n        neighbors.append((r - 1, c))  # Up\n    if r < rows - 1:\n        neighbors.append((r + 1, c))  # Down\n    if c > 0:\n        neighbors.append((r, c - 1))  # Left\n    if c < cols - 1:\n        neighbors.append((r, c + 1))  # Right\n    return neighbors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the described rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    \n    # Identify the set of wall colors\n    wall_colors_set1 = {8, 4}\n    wall_colors_set2 = {8,3}\n    # Determine which wall set using the number of times the color occurs\n    unique, counts = np.unique(input_grid, return_counts=True)\n    if (3 in unique):\n       wall_colors = wall_colors_set2\n    else:\n       wall_colors = wall_colors_set1\n\n    # Identify wall pixels\n    wall_pixels = find_walls(output_grid, wall_colors)\n\n    # Fill color\n    fill_color = 2\n\n    # Initialize a queue with the initial fill pixels (neighbors of walls)\n    fill_queue = []\n    for r, c in wall_pixels:\n        neighbors = get_neighbors(output_grid, r, c)\n        for nr, nc in neighbors:\n            if output_grid[nr, nc] not in wall_colors:\n                fill_queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    # Iteratively fill the regions\n    while fill_queue:\n        r, c = fill_queue.pop(0)  # Get the next pixel to fill\n\n        # Check again if it hasn't been filled or become a wall\n        if output_grid[r, c] not in wall_colors and output_grid[r,c] != fill_color :\n           output_grid[r, c] = fill_color\n           neighbors = get_neighbors(output_grid, r, c)\n           for nr, nc in neighbors:\n               if output_grid[nr,nc] != fill_color:  # Add neighbors to queue if not already filled\n                   fill_queue.append((nr, nc))\n    return output_grid\n```"
