task: flood_fill_with_walls
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: variable
      cols: variable
      cells: integer values (colors)
  - name: wall
    type: object
    properties:
      color: [8, 4] or [8,3] # Depends on presence of 3
      shape: lines (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
      role: boundary for fill
  - name: fill_region
    type: object
    properties:
      color: 2
      role: filled area
      initial_state: adjacent to walls
actions:
  - name: identify_walls
    input: grid, wall_colors
    output: list of wall pixel coordinates
  - name: get_neighbors
    input: grid, row, col
    output: list of valid neighbor coordinates (up, down, left, right)
  - name: flood_fill
    input: grid, wall_pixels, fill_color
    process: |
      Iteratively fills adjacent pixels with fill_color, starting from
      neighbors of wall pixels. Stops when no more pixels can be filled.
      Does NOT fill diagonally.
    output: modified grid
