The most prominent feature is the presence of lines or \"walls\" of a specific color (8/azure in both examples, 4/yellow and 3/green in example 1 and example 2 respectively) that seem to define regions. Within these regions, a new color (2/red) appears to \"fill\" the space adjacent to these walls, sometimes extending to fill entire enclosed areas. The filling seems to respect the boundaries set by the colored walls.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"

This includes both the horizontal and vertical lines formed by this color and the diagonal color line (4/yellow in the first pair and 3/green in the second).\n\n2.  **Fill Adjacent Pixels:** For each pixel identified as part of a wall, change the color of all adjacent pixels (up, down, left, and right, but *not* diagonally) to the \"fill\" color (2/red), *unless* the adjacent pixel is also part of a wall (color 8, 4 in example 1 or 8,3 in example 2).\n\n3.  **Propagate Fill:** Continue this filling process iteratively. For each newly filled pixel (color 2/red), repeat step 2, changing the color of its adjacent pixels to 2/red, again respecting the wall boundaries.\n\n4. **Termination Condition**: Stop when no more pixels can be filled. This means no more azure (8) or other background colored pixels.\n\nIn summary, it's a region-filling algorithm where \"walls\" of a specific color define the boundaries of the regions, and a \"fill\" color propagates outwards from the walls until the entire region is filled.\n"
