1.  **Identify Wall Pixels:** Determine the wall colors. If color 3 is present in the grid, the wall colors are 8 and 3. Otherwise, the wall colors are 8 and 4. Locate all pixels within the input grid that match the wall colors. These pixels constitute the "walls."

2.  **Initialize Fill:** Find all pixels adjacent (up, down, left, right - *not* diagonally) to the wall pixels. These are the starting points for the fill.

3.  **Iterative Flood Fill:**
    *   Set the color of a pixel in the "fill set" to the fill color (2/red).
    *   Add all of *its* valid neighbors (up, down, left, and right) to the "fill set" *if* they are not already the fill color (2) *and* are not wall pixels.
    *   Repeat this process until the "fill set" is empty, meaning no more pixels can be filled.

4.  **Output:** The modified grid, where all regions bounded by walls have been filled with color 2.
