Otherwise, the wall colors are 8 and 4. Locate all pixels within the input grid that match the wall colors. These pixels constitute the \"walls.\"\n\n2.  **Initialize Fill:** Find all pixels adjacent (up, down, left, right - *not* diagonally) to the wall pixels. These are the starting points for the fill.\n\n3.  **Iterative Flood Fill:**\n    *   Set the color of a pixel in the \"fill set\" to the fill color (2/red).\n    *   Add all of *its* valid neighbors (up, down, left, and right) to the \"fill set\" *if* they are not already the fill color (2) *and* are not wall pixels.\n    *   Repeat this process until the \"fill set\" is empty, meaning no more pixels can be filled.\n\n4.  **Output:** The modified grid, where all regions bounded by walls have been filled with color 2.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_walls(grid, wall_colors):\n    \"\"\"\n    Locates the wall pixels in the grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    wall_pixels = []\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r, c] in wall_colors:\n                wall_pixels.append((r, c))\n    return wall_pixels\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, r, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gets the valid neighbors (up, down, left, right) of a pixel.\n    \"\"\"\n    neighbors = []\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    if r > 0:\n        neighbors.append((r - 1, c))  # Up\n    if r < rows - 1:\n        neighbors.append((r + 1, c))  # Down\n    if c > 0:\n        neighbors.append((r, c - 1))  # Left\n    if c < cols - 1:\n        neighbors.append((r, c + 1))  # Right\n    return neighbors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    \n    # Determine wall colors\n    wall_colors_set1 = {8, 4}\n    wall_colors_set2 = {8, 3}\n    unique = np.unique(input_grid)\n    wall_colors = wall_colors_set2 if 3 in unique else wall_colors_set1\n\n    # Identify wall pixels\n    wall_pixels = find_walls(output_grid, wall_colors)\n\n    # Fill color\n    fill_color = 2\n\n    # Initialize fill queue with neighbors of wall pixels\n    fill_queue = []\n    for r, c in wall_pixels:\n        for nr, nc in get_neighbors(output_grid, r, c):\n            if output_grid[nr, nc] not in wall_colors:\n                fill_queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    # Iterative flood fill\n    while fill_queue:\n        r, c = fill_queue.pop(0)  # Get the next pixel to fill\n\n        if output_grid[r, c] != fill_color and output_grid[r, c] not in wall_colors: #check\n            output_grid[r, c] = fill_color  # Fill the pixel\n\n            # Add neighbors to the queue if they are not walls or already filled\n            for nr, nc in get_neighbors(output_grid, r, c):\n                if output_grid[nr, nc] != fill_color and output_grid[nr,nc] not in wall_colors:\n                    fill_queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
