Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The primary element seems to be the consistent presence of the color yellow (4) in all inputs and outputs. The other colors (blue - 1, orange - 7) appear to be transient or removed during the transformation. The core task seems to involve manipulating the grid based on the arrangement of the yellow pixels, and sometimes including the blue and orange pixels depending on their surrounding. It seems like there are regions of interest, and perhaps "noise" to be removed. The output often, but not always, has a smaller or similar size relative to the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - rows: variable
      - columns: variable
      - cells: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - object: pixel
    type: cell
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)

  - observation: yellow_pixels_presence
    description: Yellow (4) pixels are consistently present in both input and output.

  - observation: other_colors_transience
    description:  Blue (1) and orange (7) pixels are sometimes removed or altered in the output.

  - observation: output size
    description: The number of output rows is most often equals to input's but the output column is different.
  
  - action: cropping
    description: based on the colors keep some parts of the input grid
    parameters:
      - criteria: the location of a color in the input.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Base:** Consider the yellow (4) pixels as a kind of "base" or persistent element.
2. **Check Input Shape:** Consider all rows and only some continuous columns.
3.  **Preserve Yellow:** Keep all yellow (4) pixels in their original positions.
4. **Check Blue:** Check to keep the blue and discard oranges.
5.  **Output:** The output grid consists of kept pixels.

Essentially, the transformation seems to preserve specific parts, mostly yellow and some blues pixels and create a new grid.
