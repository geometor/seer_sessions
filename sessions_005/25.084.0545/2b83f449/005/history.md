1.  **Identify Objects:** The scene consists of three primary objects: a border object formed by connected pixels of colors 3 and 8, an irregular object with color 7, and the background with color 0.

2.  **Border State Change:** Within the border object, pixels of color 8 change to color 3, and pixels of color 3 change to color 8.

3.  **Color Replacement:** All pixels of color 7 (the irregular object) change to color 6.

4.  **Adjacent Propagation:** Any pixel of color 8 that is adjacent to a pixel of color 6 changes to color 6. This propagation continues until no more color 8 pixels are adjacent to color 6 pixels. The propagation should check *all* newly changed 6s, not just the original ones.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and the approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The current code fails to accurately transform the input grids to match the expected output grids in both provided examples. The primary issues seem to stem from:

1.  **Incorrect Border Identification:** The logic for identifying border pixels (those with colors 3 and 8 that should switch) is flawed. It only considers direct neighbors. It needs to find the *connected* components of 3s and 8s that form a border in the input.
2.  **Propagation Logic:** Although the propagation logic is present, the conditions aren't quite right, the order isn't quite right and how the border swap interacts is not clear.
3.  **Missing Context:** The examples shows an important feature, where rows of all the same value are added or removed at the bottom.

The strategy to resolve these errors will involve:

1.  **Connected Component Analysis:** Use a more robust method (like flood fill or a similar connected component labeling algorithm) to correctly identify the border pixels as a single object.
2.  **Refined Propagation:** Re-evaluate the propagation to ensure it correctly captures all changes.
3. **Address the missing context.** Look at row insertion/deletion.

**Metrics Gathering and Analysis**

To better understand the discrepancies, let's collect some metrics. I need to understand shapes of the objects and their changes.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:**
    *   A **border object** consisting of connected pixels of colors 3 and 8.  This object forms a single-pixel-wide, continuous line around the edges and within the grid.
    *   An **irregular object** composed of pixels with color 7.
    *   The **background**, consisting of all pixels with color 0.

2.  **Border Transformation (Color Swap):**
    *   Within the *connected* border object, pixels of color 8 change to color 3, and pixels of color 3 change to color 8.

3.  **Irregular Object Transformation (Color Change):**
    *   All pixels of color 7 (the irregular object) change to color 6.

4.  **Adjacent Propagation:**
    *   Any pixel of color 8 that is *adjacent* (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a pixel of color 6 changes to color 6. This propagation continues iteratively until no more color 8 pixels are adjacent to color 6 pixels.

5.  **Row Adjustment:**
    *  If the bottom row is all the same color, and it is different from the row above it, the entire row is deleted. The other rows shift down to fill the space, preserving all features.

The key improvement here is the explicit mention of "connected" for the border object, the clarification of adjacency in the propagation step and the row adjustment. This better reflects the observed transformations and addresses the shortcomings of the previous program.
