objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - blue (1)
        - red (2)
        - green (3)
        - yellow (4)
        - gray (5)
        - magenta (6)
        - orange (7)
        - azure (8)
        - maroon (9)
      position: [row, column]
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [height, width]
      cells: list of pixels

actions:
  - type: change_color
    agent: unknown
    target: pixel
    new_color: magenta (6)

relationships:
  - adjacency: pixels are adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally
  - containment: grid contains pixels
  - transformation: input grid transforms to output grid

observations:
 - orange_pixels_become_magenta: Orange (7) pixels in the input grid are consistently replaced by magenta (6) pixels in the output grid.
 - azure_border_changes: in the input grid, wherever the orange(7) changes to magenta(6) and a pixel that used to be azure(8) is touching the changed pixel, it also turns to magenta (6). The azure (8) can be on any side of the changed pixel.
 - green_border_changes: In a few cases, green pixels in the input grid are replaced by azure pixels and/or change places with azure and/or white pixels.
