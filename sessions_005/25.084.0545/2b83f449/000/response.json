The dominant colors are azure (8), white (0), green (3), and orange (7). The output introduces magenta (6) pixels. There's a strong sense of objectness, with distinct regions of color. The transformation seems localized and related to the orange (7) pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The azure (8) can be on any side of the changed pixel.\n - green_border_changes: In a few cases, green pixels in the input grid are replaced by azure pixels and/or change places with azure and/or white pixels.\n```"

There is also a secondary, less clear transformation around some borders, but it doesn't just involve azure.\n"
