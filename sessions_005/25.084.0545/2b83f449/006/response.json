            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program and code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code have significant flaws. The code does not correctly implement the intended logic, especially the color swap and propagation aspects. The `find_connected_border` function attempts to identify a connected border, but the \"connectedness\" logic is incomplete, and it doesn't properly handle internal structures. The propagation logic is not correctly bounded by the border. Also, row adjustment appears to not be working as there are still some rows with all the same color that are different from the rows above.\n\nThe main issues are:\n1.  **Incorrect Border Identification:** The `find_connected_border` function needs to accurately identify the connected border, distinguishing it from other isolated pixels of the same color.\n2.  **Incorrect Color Swap:** The border color swap is not constrained to the actual connected border, leading to incorrect color changes.\n3.  **Unbounded Propagation:** The color propagation is not limited to the region defined by the border and spreads incorrectly.\n4.  **Row Adjustment** Row adjustment isn't fully implemented\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Border Identification:** Improve `find_connected_border` to correctly identify the continuous border using a more robust connectivity check, possibly using an iterative approach.\n2.  **Constrain Color Swap:** Ensure the color swap occurs *only* within the identified connected border.\n3.  **Bound Propagation:** Restrict color propagation to within the border.\n4.  **Review and Improve:** Refactor the code significantly to ensure clarity and correctness, testing each step thoroughly.\n5. **Fix Row Adjustment**: ensure only bottom rows are evaluated for deletion and fix deletion logic.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nLet's analyze each example in more detail and gather metrics.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input Shape:** (13, 19)\n*   **Output Shape:** (13, 19)\n*   **Pixel Differences:** 139\n*   **Observations:** The color swap occurs across the *entire* grid wherever 3s and 8s are present, not just the border. Propagation is unbounded.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input Shape:** (11, 16)\n*   **Output Shape:** (10, 16)\n*   **Pixel Differences:** 88. The row adjustment is also not properly implemented, and there is a row which should have been removed.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
