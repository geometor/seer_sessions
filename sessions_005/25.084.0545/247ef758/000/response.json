The transformation appears to selectively modify certain colored regions within the input grid to produce the output grid. The most prominent change seems to be an infilling or expansion of specific color regions, often around the edges or within existing shapes. There's a sense of \"leaking\" or \"filling\" of color, but it's not uniform; it's constrained by certain rules that need to be determined. It seems the outside border of the shape is relatively preserved.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
