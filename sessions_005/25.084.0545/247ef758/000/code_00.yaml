facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      The color '0' (white) often acts as a background or is replaced by other colors.
  - observation: |
      Colors other than '0' form connected regions or "objects."
  - observation: |
      In the output, some color regions within the input expand, primarily around edges or where they are adjacent to '0'.
  - observation: |
      The first non-zero color encountered on each row and column is maintained, and expands to fill the neighboring cells if possible.
  - observation: |
    Colors expand from left-to-right, top-to-bottom along lines where the first non-zero color has been detected.
  - observation: |
     Color expansion stops if it meets the original outer boundary of an object
