examples:
  - example_id: 1
    objects:
      - color: 4 # yellow
        shape: vertical line, horizontal line
      - color: 2 # red
        shape: vertical line
      - color: 3 # green
        shape: mostly vertical line, then solid block
      - color: 6 # magenta
        shape: vertical line
      - color: 7 #orange
        shape: vertical line, L-Shape
    transformations:
      - description: "Zeros are replaced by the color of adjacent non-zero areas. The propagation stops at the boundary of a different color."
      - affected_pixels: "0 pixels adjacent to non-zero color regions"
      - rule: "If a '0' pixel is adjacent to a non-zero pixel, it takes the color of the adjacent pixel, unless that would cross the boundary of another differently colored region."
  - example_id: 2
    objects:
      - color: 5, shape: Vertical Line
      - color: 3, shape: Vertical Line
      - color: 4, shape: large connected L
      - color: 7, shape: vertical line
      - color: 8, shape: vertical line
    transformations:
      - description: "Zeros are replaced by neighboring colors, stopping at color borders."
      - affected_pixels: Zeros
      - rule: If a 0 is adjacent to a colored pixel, it gets that color, unless the fill will cross a border
  - example_id: 3
    objects:
     - color: 3, shape: vertical line
     - color: 1, shape: vertical line
     - color: 2, shape: connected vertical line
     - color: 6, shape: vertical line, then L
     - color: 7, shape: large L
    transformations:
     - description: Zeros replaced by nearby color
     - affected_pixels: zero pixels
     - rule: Zeros next to color, take on that color, propagation stops at borders
