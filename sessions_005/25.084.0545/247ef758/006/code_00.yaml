objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents a rectangular grid of pixels.
    properties:
      - rows: Number of rows in the grid.
      - cols: Number of columns in the grid.
      - cells: Individual pixel values (0-9, representing colors).

  - name: pixel
    type: element
    description: A single cell within the grid.
    properties:
      - row: Row index of the pixel.
      - col: Column index of the pixel.
      - color: The color value of the pixel (0-9).
      - neighbors: Adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right).

actions:
  - name: fill
    description: Replace a pixel's color with another color.
    parameters:
      - target_pixel: The pixel to be filled.
      - source_color: The color to fill with.
    preconditions:
      - target_pixel.color == 0
    postconditions:
      - target_pixel.color == source_color

  - name: propagate
    description: Extend a color from one pixel to its neighbors.
    parameters:
      - source_pixel:  Pixel from the original color
    preconditions:
      - source_pixel.color != 0
    postconditions:
      - Neighboring pixels with color 0 may change to source_pixel.color

rules:
  - propagation_rule:  0 pixels take the color of a single, adjacent non-zero neighbor, if one exists.
  - contested_pixel_rule: If a 0 pixel has neighbors of multiple non-zero colors, examine the *output* example, and determine the color from those neighbors which should be used.
