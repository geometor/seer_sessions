The values within the grid represent colors.\n*   **Colors:** Multiple colors are present, but their distribution and arrangement change between input and output.\n*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of the same color can be considered as distinct objects. Some objects maintain colors, others disappear or change color.\n*   **Background:** The '0' (white) color seems to act as a background, and the transformation primarily affects non-zero colored pixels.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

If the color block has any pixel of color 9. replace all color 9 with color block's original color.\n4  **Output:** Create an output grid with the original dimensions, where the identified object parts have had their colors maintained or replaced.\n\nIn summary:\n\n*   If the input is color 9, find it's color block, and find the original color for this block, then paint all 9 to the original color.\n"
