            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe code performs a flood fill, replacing green (3) pixels with maroon (9) pixels, starting from a green pixel adjacent to a red (2) pixel. However, the flood fill doesn't always stop where it should, sometimes it's too expansive, and in other instances, it stops prematurely. This indicates problems with the boundary conditions of the flood fill or the identification of the \"enclosing shape\". The examples also show other colors in the input, but only 3's connected to 2 are transformed. The strategy is to redefine the concept of \"enclosing shape\" to accurately capture the intended region for transformation.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nI'll use `tool_code` to perform calculations, helping to analyze the results.\n\n"
