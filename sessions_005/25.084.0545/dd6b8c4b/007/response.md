1.  **Find the Red Pixel:** Locate the single red (color 2) pixel in the input grid. If there isn't exactly one red pixel, the input grid remains unchanged.
2.  **Identify Adjacent Green Object:** Find the green (color 3) object that is directly adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to the red pixel. There may be multiple disjunct green objects but only the one connected to the red pixel is of interest.
3.  **Check Entire Shape Adjacency:** If the *entire* green object identified in step 2 is adjacent to the red pixel, change all pixels within that green object to maroon (color 9).
4. **No other changes.** If any part of a green object is not adjacent to the red object, then it is not changed.
