            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code have a fundamental flaw: they assume that *all* green pixels connected (orthogonally or diagonally) to the single red pixel should be transformed to maroon. The test results clearly show this isn't always the case. The expected outputs demonstrate a more selective transformation.  The key error is in how the green region is defined, and the key strategy for resolution is a more in-depth observation of shape and position.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example.  Identify *precisely* which green pixels were incorrectly changed (or not changed) and *why*.\n2.  **Refine Region Definition:** The core problem is the overly broad definition of the \"connected green region.\" We need a more precise rule. Looking at the expected outputs, it is apparent that a contiguous block of green is changed if the *entire* shape of the block is adjacent to the red pixel.\n3. **Consider Shape:** It is helpful to think of these pixels as objects and the rule is likely related to completing a shape.\n4.  **Update Natural Language Program:**  Rewrite the program to reflect the refined understanding, paying close attention to the conditions under which the green-to-maroon transformation occurs.\n5.  **Iterative Refinement:** It is likely to need a few iterations to improve the code based on feedback.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's get some concrete data about the examples using code execution.\n\n"
