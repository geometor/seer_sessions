There are regions of uniform color and regions where colors change.  The inputs are not the same size.\n*   **Output:** The output is a smaller grid, also of single-digit integers (colors). The output seems to capture some, *but not all*, of the colors present in the input, and in a much more condensed form. The colors of the output aren't just a simple sub-grid, but a filtered sub-grid of the important color transitions of the input.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation isn't a simple cropping or resizing. It feels like a \"feature extraction\" or \"significant change detection\" process. The output grid seems to highlight *where* color changes occur in the input, with an emphasis on enclosed, or cornered, internal spaces. It is selecting a connected set of interior blocks.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

Edge-touching of the same color \"extends\" the block, but diagonal does not count as extending.\n2.  **Connectivity within interior**: Identify blocks connected by interior blocks.\n3.  **Output Formation:** Create a new, smaller output grid. The size appears to be determined by the number and arrangement of distinct interior blocks and their connections.\n4.  **Populate Output:**\n    *   Iterate through the connected interior blocks.\n    *   Transfer the color of each interior block that contains changes to the output grid, preserving relative spatial relationships, but condensing the overall size. It looks as if we pick the top left cell of each interior block, and place that value in order in the output matrix.\n\nThis program prioritizes the identification and representation of *enclosed, connected* color regions, discarding uniform areas along the edges of the grid, and focusing on the interaction of colors.\n"
