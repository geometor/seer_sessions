facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input grid is a 2D array of integers (colors).
    properties:
      - width: variable
      - height: variable
      - values: integers 0-9

  - type: grid
    description: Output grid is a 2D array of integers (colors).
    properties:
      - width: variable, smaller than input width
      - height: variable, smaller than input height
      - values: integers 0-9

  - type: object
    description: Colored regions within the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - shape: contiguous block
      - location: (row, col) coordinates

  - type: transformation
    description: Reduction and feature extraction.
    actions:
      - Detect significant color changes or boundaries in input.
      - Preserve colors involved in significant changes.
      - Reduce grid size, focusing on change locations.
      - Prioritize internally surrounded regions.
      - Output only connected interior blocks of colored objects
