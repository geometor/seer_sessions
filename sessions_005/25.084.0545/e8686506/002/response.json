However, the test results, especially Example 2, reveal that this definition is too restrictive. The expected outputs include blocks that aren't fully enclosed. The code also fails to capture the relative positioning and size of all connected internal regions accurately, as seen from dimension errors. It appears to try to identify some kind of inside pixels and is failing.\n\nThe primary strategy is to redefine \"interior blocks\" (or perhaps just \"blocks\") to better reflect the examples. We need to consider connected components of the *same* color as potential blocks, even if they are not surrounded, which the current implementation considers to be 'outside' pixels. The relative positioning and potentially the *shape* of these components need to be preserved in some simplified form in the output.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Evidence:**\n\nTo confirm this strategy, let's get metrics on the size and pixel differences between expected and produced output.\n"
