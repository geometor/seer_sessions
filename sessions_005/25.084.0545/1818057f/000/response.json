The primary colors involved are red (2), blue (4), and azure (8).  The most noticeable change is the selective replacement of some red (2) and yellow (4) pixels with azure (8) pixels. The azure (8) pixels always seem to replace 4s that have adjacent 2s. Azure does not replace all 4s, the transformation of 4's appears conditional.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
