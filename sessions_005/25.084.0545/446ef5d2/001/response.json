Shift objects in the left part of the grid to the bottom\n\n    b. delete regions in the right part of the grid, replacing it with 8\n\n5. **Combine Results**: Create the final grid by combining all partitions\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds contiguous regions (objects) of the same color.\"\"\"\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n\n    def dfs(row, col, color, object_pixels):\n        if (row < 0 or row >= grid.shape[0] or col < 0 or col >= grid.shape[1] or\n                visited[row, col] or grid[row, col] != color):\n            return\n        visited[row, col] = True\n        object_pixels.append((row, col))\n        # Check all 8 neighbors\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                    continue\n                dfs(row + dr, col + dc, color, object_pixels)\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if not visited[row, col]:\n                object_pixels = []\n                dfs(row, col, grid[row, col], object_pixels)\n                if object_pixels:\n                    objects.append({'color': grid[row, col], 'pixels': object_pixels})\n    return objects\n\ndef bounding_box(pixels):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the bounding box of a set of pixels.\"\"\"\n    min_row = min(p[0] for p in pixels)\n    max_row = max(p[0] for p in pixels)\n    min_col = min(p[1] for p in pixels)\n    max_col = max(p[1] for p in pixels)\n    return (min_row, min_col), (max_row, max_col)\n\ndef shift_object_down(grid, object_pixels):\n    \"\"\"Shifts an object down to the bottom of the grid.\"\"\"\n    \n    # Sort the pixels by row in descending order (to handle overlaps correctly)\n    object_pixels.sort(key=lambda p: p[0], reverse=True)\n\n    color = grid[object_pixels[0]]\n\n    for row,col in object_pixels:\n        grid[row,col] = 8\n\n    \n    rows_to_shift = {}\n\n    for r,c in object_pixels:\n        if c not in rows_to_shift:\n            rows_to_shift[c] = 0\n        \n        new_row = grid.shape[0]-1 - rows_to_shift[c]\n\n        while new_row > 0 and grid[new_row,c] != 8:\n            rows_to_shift[c]+=1\n            new_row = grid.shape[0]-1 - rows_to_shift[c]\n        \n        grid[new_row,c] = color\n        rows_to_shift[c] += 1\n            \n    return grid\n  \n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # 1.
