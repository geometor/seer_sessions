Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Size:** Both input and output grids are consistently 3x3.
2.  **Colors:** The colors present in the input grid are the same as the colors in the output grid. No colors are added or removed, and no colors are changed.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves rearranging the pixels within the grid. Comparing the input and output grids, it appears to be a geometric transformation affecting the entire grid structure.
4.  **Coordinate Mapping:** By tracking individual pixels, we can observe a specific mapping:
    *   Input(0,0) -> Output(2,1)
    *   Input(0,1) -> Output(2,2)
    *   Input(0,2) -> Output(2,0)
    *   Input(1,0) -> Output(1,2)
    *   Input(1,1) -> Output(1,1) (Center pixel remains fixed)
    *   Input(1,2) -> Output(1,0)
    *   Input(2,0) -> Output(0,2)
    *   Input(2,1) -> Output(0,1)
    *   Input(2,2) -> Output(0,0)
5.  **Geometric Interpretation:** This mapping is almost a 180-degree rotation around the center pixel (1,1). A standard 180-degree rotation would map Input(0,0) to Output(2,2) and Input(0,1) to Output(2,1). The observed mapping swaps these two specific destinations. All other pixel movements align with a 180-degree rotation.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_size_input: [3, 3]
  grid_size_output: [3, 3]
  object_type: pixels
  transformation_type: geometric rearrangement
  color_preservation: true
  background_color: 0 (white), treated same as other pixels

transformation_details:
  primary_operation: Rotate 180 degrees around the center pixel (1,1).
  secondary_operation: Swap the pixels located at coordinates (2,1) and (2,2) after the rotation.
  fixed_point: Center pixel at (1,1).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input 3x3 grid.
2.  Create a new 3x3 grid by rotating the input grid 180 degrees around its center.
    *   This means the pixel at input `(r, c)` moves to `(2-r, 2-c)` in the intermediate grid.
3.  In the resulting rotated grid, swap the values of the two pixels located at coordinates (2, 1) and (2, 2) (bottom-middle and bottom-right).
4.  The final grid after the swap is the output grid.
