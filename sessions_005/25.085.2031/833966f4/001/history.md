*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are presented as vertical lists of single digits (colors). This can be interpreted as an Nx1 grid or a simple list of numbers.
    *   In both examples, the input list has a length of 5. The output list also has a length of 5.
    *   The colors present in the output list are exactly the same as the colors in the input list; only their positions have changed.
    *   The transformation appears to involve swapping pairs of adjacent elements based on their position (index) in the list.
    *   Specifically, in both examples, the elements at indices (0, 1) are swapped, and the elements at indices (3, 4) are swapped. The element at index 2 remains in its original position. This suggests a pattern where swaps occur for pairs starting at indices that are multiples of 3.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: rearrangement
    input_shape: Nx1 grid (or list of length N)
    output_shape: Nx1 grid (or list of length N, same N as input)
    element_type: integer colors (0-9)
    transformation: positional conditional swapping
    properties:
      - conservation_of_elements: All input colors are present in the output, and no new colors are introduced.
      - structure_preservation: The length of the list (or height of the column grid) remains the same.
      - action: Swapping of adjacent elements.
      - condition: The swap occurs only if the index of the first element in the pair is a multiple of 3.
    relationships:
      - adjacency: The swapping action involves elements that are directly next to each other in the list.
      - index_based_logic: The decision to swap depends on the numerical index of the elements.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input list of colors.
    2.  Create a copy of the input list to modify.
    3.  Iterate through the indices `i` of the list, starting from `i = 0` up to `length - 2`.
    4.  For each index `i`, check if `i` is divisible by 3 (i.e., `i % 3 == 0`).
    5.  If `i` is divisible by 3, swap the element at index `i` with the element at index `i + 1` in the copied list.
    6.  After iterating through all possible starting indices `i`, the modified list is the final output.
