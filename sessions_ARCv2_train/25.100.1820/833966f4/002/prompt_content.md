"""
Iterate through the input list, processing elements in pairs starting from the first element. 
For each pair of adjacent elements encountered, swap their positions. 
If the list contains an odd number of elements, the final element remains unchanged in its position relative to the swapped pairs. 
Construct the output list by appending the swapped pairs (and the final element if applicable) in their new order.
