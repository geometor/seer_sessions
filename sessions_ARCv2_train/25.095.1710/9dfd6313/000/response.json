The values appear to be non-negative integers, with zero often representing an empty or background cell.\n*   **Properties:** Each grid has dimensions (height and width). Each cell within the grid has coordinates (row, column) and a value.\n*   **Relationships:** There is a clear relationship between the input grid and the output grid. They always have the same dimensions. The key transformation involves rearranging the positions of the non-zero numbers (and zeros) based on their original coordinates.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears consistent across all examples. It looks like a reflection across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) or, in matrix terms, a transposition. The value at `Input[row][col]` seems to move to `Output[col][row]`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
