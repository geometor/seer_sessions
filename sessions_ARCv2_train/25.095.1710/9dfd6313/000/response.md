Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Objects:** The core objects are two-dimensional grids (or matrices) containing numerical values. The values appear to be non-negative integers, with zero often representing an empty or background cell.
*   **Properties:** Each grid has dimensions (height and width). Each cell within the grid has coordinates (row, column) and a value.
*   **Relationships:** There is a clear relationship between the input grid and the output grid. They always have the same dimensions. The key transformation involves rearranging the positions of the non-zero numbers (and zeros) based on their original coordinates.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears consistent across all examples. It looks like a reflection across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) or, in matrix terms, a transposition. The value at `Input[row][col]` seems to move to `Output[col][row]`.

**YAML Facts:**

    properties:
      - data_type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: derived from input (M x N) # Transpose swaps dimensions

    to: output_grid_cell
    attributes:

      - output_coordinates: (col_i, row_i) # Coordinates are swapped
      - value: preserved (Output[col_i][row_i] = Input[row_i][col_i])
actions:
  - name: transpose
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: >
      Create the output grid by swapping the row and column indices
      for each element in the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the dimensions of the input grid: number of rows (N) and number of columns (M).
2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions swapped: M rows and N columns.
3.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid using its row index `i` (from 0 to N-1) and column index `j` (from 0 to M-1).
4.  For each cell `(i, j)` in the input grid, copy its value to the cell `(j, i)` in the output grid.
5.  The resulting grid is the final output.
