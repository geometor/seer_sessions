The output is 3 times taller and 2 times wider than the input, suggesting a 3x2 tiling structure where each tile is a 3x2 block derived from the input.\n4.  **Transformations:** Comparing inputs and outputs reveals transformations like swapping columns and flipping the grid vertically.\n5.  **Conditional Logic:** The specific arrangement of the tiled blocks changes between examples (compare `train_1`/`train_2` with `train_3`). This suggests a condition based on some property of the input grid determines the transformation rule. Observing the inputs, `train_1` and `train_2` are vertically symmetric (row 0 equals row 2), while `train_3` is not. This symmetry appears to be the deciding factor.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Determine if `I` is vertically symmetric by comparing its first row (`I[0]`) with its last row (`I[2]`).\n3.  Create four 3x2 grids based on `I`:\n    *   `Block_I`: The original input grid `I`.\n    *   `Block_Swap`: Grid `I` with its columns swapped.\n    *   `Block_Flip_V`: Grid `I` flipped vertically.\n    *   `Block_Flip_VH`: Grid `I` flipped vertically and horizontally.\n4.  Choose a 3x2 pattern of these blocks based on the symmetry check:\n    *   If `I` is vertically symmetric, the pattern is `[[Block_Swap, Block_I], [Block_Swap, Block_I], [Block_Swap, Block_I]]`.\n    *   If `I` is not vertically symmetric, the pattern is `[[Block_Flip_VH, Block_Flip_V], [Block_Swap, Block_I], [Block_Flip_VH, Block_Flip_V]]`.\n5.  Assemble the final 9x4 output grid by arranging the chosen 3x2 blocks according to the selected 3x2 pattern. The block at pattern position `[r][c]` becomes the 3x2 subgrid in the output starting at row `r*3` and column `c*2`."
