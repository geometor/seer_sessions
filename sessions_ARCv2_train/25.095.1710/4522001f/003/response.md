"""
Places two 4x4 blocks of digit '3' onto a 9x9 grid of '0's based on input grid patterns.

1. Receive the 3x3 input grid.
2. Identify the coordinates (row, column) of all cells in the input grid that contain a non-zero value.
3. If no non-zero cells are found, return a 9x9 grid filled entirely with 0s.
4. If non-zero cells exist, find the minimum row index (`min_r`) and the minimum column index (`min_c`) among these coordinates. This defines the top-leftmost non-zero cell's position.
5. Create a 9x9 output grid and initialize all its cells to 0.
6. Fill a 4x4 region in the output grid with the value 3, starting at the top-left corner `(min_r, min_c)`.
7. Fill another 4x4 region in the output grid with the value 3, starting at the top-left corner `(min_r + 4, min_c + 4)`.
8. Return the completed 9x9 output grid.
