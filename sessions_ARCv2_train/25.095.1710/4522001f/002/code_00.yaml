task_description: Place two 4x4 blocks of digit '3' onto a 9x9 grid of '0's based on input grid patterns.
elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - cell_values: integers (0, 2, 3)
      - role: Determines placement of output blocks via non-zero cell locations.
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - dimensions: 9x9
      - cell_values: integers (0, 3)
      - structure: Base of '0's with two 4x4 blocks of '3's.
  - object: non_zero_cells
    properties:
      - type: set of coordinates (row, column)
      - source: input_grid cells with values != 0
  - object: top_left_non_zero_cell
    properties:
      - type: coordinate (min_r, min_c)
      - derivation: Minimum row and minimum column index from non_zero_cells.
  - object: output_block
    properties:
      - type: grid_region
      - dimensions: 4x4
      - cell_value: 3
      - count: 2 per output grid
relations:
  - type: placement
    description: The position of the top_left_non_zero_cell determines the placement of the output blocks.
    details:
      - First block starts at (min_r, min_c).
      - Second block starts at (min_r + 4, min_c + 4).
actions:
  - action: identify_non_zero
    input: input_grid
    output: non_zero_cells coordinates
  - action: find_top_left
    input: non_zero_cells coordinates
    output: top_left_non_zero_cell coordinate (min_r, min_c)
  - action: initialize_output
    output: 9x9 grid filled with 0s
  - action: place_blocks
    input: top_left_non_zero_cell coordinate (min_r, min_c)
    target: output_grid
    process:
      - Write a 4x4 block of 3s starting at (min_r, min_c).
      - Write a 4x4 block of 3s starting at (min_r + 4, min_c + 4).
