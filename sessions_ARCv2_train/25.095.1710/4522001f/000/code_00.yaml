task_description: Grid transformation involving upscaling and value mapping.
elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - cell_values: integers (e.g., 0, 2, 3)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - dimensions: 9x9
      - cell_values: integers (e.g., 0, 3)
relations:
  - type: mapping
    description: Each cell in the input_grid maps to a 3x3 block in the output_grid.
    details: The input cell at (row, col) maps to the output block starting at (row * 3, col * 3).
actions:
  - action: upscale
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid (structure)
    factor: 3 (in both dimensions)
  - action: value_transformation
    input: value from input_grid cell
    output: value for the corresponding 3x3 output_grid block
    rule:
      - condition: input value is 0
        result: output block filled with 0
      - condition: input value is non-zero (e.g., 2 or 3)
        result: output block filled with 3
