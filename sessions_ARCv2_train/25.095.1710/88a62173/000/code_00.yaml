Objects:
  - InputGrid:
      Properties:
        - type: grid
        - dimensions: 5x5
        - cell_content: single digits
  - OutputGrid:
      Properties:
        - type: grid
        - dimensions: 2x2
        - cell_content: single digits
  - Quadrants:
      Description: The InputGrid can be divided into four 2x2 quadrants by excluding the middle row (index 2) and middle column (index 2).
      Names:
        - Top-Left (TL): Input cells [0:2, 0:2]
        - Top-Right (TR): Input cells [0:2, 3:5]
        - Bottom-Left (BL): Input cells [3:5, 0:2]
        - Bottom-Right (BR): Input cells [3:5, 3:5]
Relationships:
  - Mapping: Each cell in the OutputGrid corresponds to one Quadrant in the InputGrid.
      - Output[0, 0] <-> Quadrant TL
      - Output[0, 1] <-> Quadrant TR
      - Output[1, 0] <-> Quadrant BL
      - Output[1, 1] <-> Quadrant BR
Actions:
  - Select Cell: For each OutputGrid cell, a specific cell value is selected from its corresponding InputGrid Quadrant based on a fixed relative position within that quadrant.
      - Output[0, 0] value is taken from Quadrant TL's bottom-right cell (Input[1, 1]).
      - Output[0, 1] value is taken from Quadrant TR's top-right cell (Input[0, 4]).
      - Output[1, 0] value is taken from Quadrant BL's bottom-left cell (Input[4, 0]).
      - Output[1, 1] value is taken from Quadrant BR's bottom-right cell (Input[4, 4]).
  - Construct Output: The selected cell values are arranged into the 2x2 OutputGrid according to the quadrant mapping.
