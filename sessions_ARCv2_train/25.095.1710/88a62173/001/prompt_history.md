Okay, let's analyze the task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Data:** The input is consistently a 5x5 grid containing single digits.
2.  **Output Data:** The output is consistently a 2x2 grid containing single digits.
3.  **Structure Preservation/Change:** The task involves a reduction in grid size from 5x5 to 2x2.
4.  **Key Feature:** The central row (index 2) and central column (index 2) of the input grid seem to be ignored or act as separators. In all provided examples, these central elements are zeros, but the core logic likely involves partitioning the grid around this center.
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to map four distinct regions (quadrants) of the input grid (excluding the central row/column) to the four cells of the output grid. The value for each output cell is selected from a specific position within its corresponding input quadrant.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Objects:
  - InputGrid:
      Properties:
        - type: grid
        - dimensions: 5x5
        - cell_content: single digits
  - OutputGrid:
      Properties:
        - type: grid
        - dimensions: 2x2
        - cell_content: single digits
  - Quadrants:
      Description: The InputGrid can be divided into four 2x2 quadrants by excluding the middle row (index 2) and middle column (index 2).
      Names:
        - Top-Left (TL): Input cells [0:2, 0:2]
        - Top-Right (TR): Input cells [0:2, 3:5]
        - Bottom-Left (BL): Input cells [3:5, 0:2]
        - Bottom-Right (BR): Input cells [3:5, 3:5]
Relationships:
  - Mapping: Each cell in the OutputGrid corresponds to one Quadrant in the InputGrid.
      - Output[0, 0] <-> Quadrant TL
      - Output[0, 1] <-> Quadrant TR
      - Output[1, 0] <-> Quadrant BL
      - Output[1, 1] <-> Quadrant BR
Actions:
  - Select Cell: For each OutputGrid cell, a specific cell value is selected from its corresponding InputGrid Quadrant based on a fixed relative position within that quadrant.
      - Output[0, 0] value is taken from Quadrant TL's bottom-right cell (Input[1, 1]).
      - Output[0, 1] value is taken from Quadrant TR's top-right cell (Input[0, 4]).
      - Output[1, 0] value is taken from Quadrant BL's bottom-left cell (Input[4, 0]).
      - Output[1, 1] value is taken from Quadrant BR's bottom-right cell (Input[4, 4]).
  - Construct Output: The selected cell values are arranged into the 2x2 OutputGrid according to the quadrant mapping.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty 2x2 output grid.
2.  Identify the value at input grid position (row 1, column 1). Assign this value to the output grid at position (row 0, column 0).
3.  Identify the value at input grid position (row 0, column 4). Assign this value to the output grid at position (row 0, column 1).
4.  Identify the value at input grid position (row 4, column 0). Assign this value to the output grid at position (row 1, column 0).
5.  Identify the value at input grid position (row 4, column 4). Assign this value to the output grid at position (row 1, column 1).
6.  Return the constructed 2x2 output grid.
