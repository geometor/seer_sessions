Task: Grid Downsampling by Index Filtering

Input:
  Type: Grid (Matrix)
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: 6x6
    - Element Type: Integer
    - Sparsity: Often contains many zero elements.
    - Structure: Can be viewed as a 3x3 grid of significant cells interleaved with rows/columns of zeros or ignored values. Significant cells are at `[row][col]` where `row` and `col` are both even (0, 2, 4).

Output:
  Type: Grid (Matrix)
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: 3x3
    - Element Type: Integer
    - Content: Derived directly from specific elements of the input grid.

Transformation:
  Name: Even Index Selection
  Action: Selects elements from the input grid based on their indices.
  Rule: An element at input grid position `[input_row][input_col]` is selected if and only if both `input_row` and `input_col` are even numbers (0, 2, 4).
  Mapping:
    - The selected element `input[input_row][input_col]` is placed in the output grid at position `[output_row][output_col]`.
    - The mapping is: `output_row = input_row / 2` and `output_col = input_col / 2`.
  Result: A new 3x3 grid containing the selected elements, preserving their relative spatial order.
