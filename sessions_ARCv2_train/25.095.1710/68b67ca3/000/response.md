Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input Structure**: The input is consistently a 6x6 grid (matrix) of integers.
2.  **Output Structure**: The output is consistently a 3x3 grid (matrix) of integers.
3.  **Data Characteristics**:
    *   The input grids contain many zeros.
    *   Non-zero numbers in the input seem strategically placed.
    *   Observing the indices (0-based), the non-zero numbers, and the numbers relevant to the output, appear only in rows 0, 2, and 4, and columns 0, 2, and 4.
    *   Rows 1, 3, 5 and columns 1, 3, 5 in the input seem to act as padding or separators and are ignored in the output.
4.  **Transformation**: The transformation appears to be a form of grid downsampling or filtering. It extracts specific elements from the larger input grid to form the smaller output grid. The elements extracted are those located at the intersections of even-indexed rows and even-indexed columns.

## Task Facts YAML


```yaml
Task: Grid Downsampling by Index Filtering

Input:
  Type: Grid (Matrix)
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: 6x6
    - Element Type: Integer
    - Sparsity: Often contains many zero elements.
    - Structure: Can be viewed as a 3x3 grid of significant cells interleaved with rows/columns of zeros or ignored values. Significant cells are at `[row][col]` where `row` and `col` are both even (0, 2, 4).

Output:
  Type: Grid (Matrix)
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: 3x3
    - Element Type: Integer
    - Content: Derived directly from specific elements of the input grid.

Transformation:
  Name: Even Index Selection
  Action: Selects elements from the input grid based on their indices.
  Rule: An element at input grid position `[input_row][input_col]` is selected if and only if both `input_row` and `input_col` are even numbers (0, 2, 4).
  Mapping:
    - The selected element `input[input_row][input_col]` is placed in the output grid at position `[output_row][output_col]`.
    - The mapping is: `output_row = input_row / 2` and `output_col = input_col / 2`.
  Result: A new 3x3 grid containing the selected elements, preserving their relative spatial order.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty 3x3 output grid.
2.  Iterate through the rows of the 6x6 input grid with index `input_row` from 0 to 5.
3.  Inside the row loop, iterate through the columns of the input grid with index `input_col` from 0 to 5.
4.  Check if both `input_row` and `input_col` are even numbers (i.e., `input_row % 2 == 0` and `input_col % 2 == 0`).
5.  If both indices are even, calculate the corresponding output grid indices: `output_row = input_row / 2` and `output_col = input_col / 2`.
6.  Assign the value from the input grid at `[input_row][input_col]` to the output grid at `[output_row][output_col]`.
7.  After iterating through all elements of the input grid, the output grid is complete. Return the 3x3 output grid.
