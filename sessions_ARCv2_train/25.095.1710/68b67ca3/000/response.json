It extracts specific elements from the larger input grid to form the smaller output grid. The elements extracted are those located at the intersections of even-indexed rows and even-indexed columns.\n\n## Task Facts YAML\n\n"

Significant cells are at `[row][col]` where `row` and `col` are both even (0, 2, 4).\n\nOutput:\n  Type: Grid (Matrix)\n  Properties:\n    - Dimensions: 3x3\n    - Element Type: Integer\n    - Content: Derived directly from specific elements of the input grid.\n\nTransformation:\n  Name: Even Index Selection\n  Action: Selects elements from the input grid based on their indices.\n  Rule: An element at input grid position `[input_row][input_col]` is selected if and only if both `input_row` and `input_col` are even numbers (0, 2, 4).\n  Mapping:\n    - The selected element `input[input_row][input_col]` is placed in the output grid at position `[output_row][output_col]`.\n    - The mapping is: `output_row = input_row / 2` and `output_col = input_col / 2`.\n  Result: A new 3x3 grid containing the selected elements, preserving their relative spatial order.\n```"

Check if both `input_row` and `input_col` are even numbers (i.e., `input_row % 2 == 0` and `input_col % 2 == 0`).\n5.  If both indices are even, calculate the corresponding output grid indices: `output_row = input_row / 2` and `output_col = input_col / 2`.\n6.  Assign the value from the input grid at `[input_row][input_col]` to the output grid at `[output_row][output_col]`.\n7.  After iterating through all elements of the input grid, the output grid is complete. Return the 3x3 output grid."
