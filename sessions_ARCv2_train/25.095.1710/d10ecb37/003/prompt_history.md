Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input:** The input is a multi-line string representing a grid of single-digit integers. The grid dimensions (rows and columns) can vary between examples. The input grids can contain duplicate rows.
*   **Output:** The output is always a 2x2 grid represented as a multi-line string, with space-separated integers.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve selecting specific elements from the input grid to form the output grid. The presence of duplicate rows in the input suggests that uniqueness might play a role. The output consistently takes elements from the top-left portion of some structure derived from the input.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input string and parse it into a grid of integers, where each inner list represents a row.
2.  Create a new list to store the unique rows encountered so far, maintaining the order in which they first appear in the input grid. Iterate through the rows of the input grid; if a row is not already in the unique rows list, add it.
3.  Take the first unique row from the list generated in step 2 and extract its first two integer elements. These form the first row of the output grid.
4.  Take the second unique row from the list generated in step 2 and extract its first two integer elements. These form the second row of the output grid.
5.  Combine these two rows to form the final 2x2 output grid.
6.  Format the 2x2 output grid into a string with space-separated integers within rows and a newline character separating the rows.

Results for code_00.py:
Train Set Error: error:
No module named 'grid_utils'
**General Assessment:**

The error reported (`No module named 'grid_utils'`) indicates an issue with the execution environment or missing utility functions, not necessarily a flaw in the core transformation logic derived from the first example. The core logic proposed was: 1) Parse the input grid, 2) Find unique rows while preserving the order of first appearance, 3) Extract the top-left 2x2 subgrid from the unique rows, 4) Format the output.

To confirm this logic, I will manually apply it to each training example.

**Metrics and Analysis:**

*   **Train 1:**
    *   Input Rows: 8
    *   Input Columns: 8
    *   Unique Rows (in order of first appearance):
        
```
        [2, 4, 2, 2, 5, 2, 4, 5]
        [2, 5, 5, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2]
        [4, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4]
        [2, 2, 4, 2, 5, 4, 2, 5]
        ```

    *   Top-left 2x2 from unique rows:
        
```
        [2, 4]
        [2, 5]
        ```

    *   Expected Output:
        
```
        2 4
        2 5
        ```

    *   Result: The logic matches the expected output.

*   **Train 2:**
    *   Input Rows: 6
    *   Input Columns: 6
    *   Unique Rows (in order of first appearance): All input rows are unique.
        
```
        [4, 3, 6, 4, 0, 6]
        [6, 0, 0, 3, 3, 4]
        [6, 4, 4, 3, 3, 0]
        [0, 3, 6, 0, 4, 6]
        [0, 6, 3, 0, 4, 3]
        [3, 4, 4, 6, 6, 0]
        ```

    *   Top-left 2x2 from unique rows:
        
```
        [4, 3]
        [6, 0]
        ```

    *   Expected Output:
        
```
        4 3
        6 0
        ```

    *   Result: The logic matches the expected output.

*   **Train 3:**
    *   Input Rows: 12
    *   Input Columns: 6
    *   Unique Rows (in order of first appearance):
        
```
        [3, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1]
        [1, 4, 4, 2, 2, 3]
        [1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 4]
        [4, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1]
        [4, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2]
        [2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4]
        [2, 4, 4, 1, 1, 3]
        [3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2]
        ```

    *   Top-left 2x2 from unique rows:
        
```
        [3, 2]
        [1, 4]
        ```

    *   Expected Output:
        
```
        3 2
        1 4
        ```

    *   Result: The logic matches the expected output.

**Conclusion:** The transformation logic of finding unique rows (preserving order) and then extracting the top-left 2x2 subgrid holds true for all provided training examples. The reported error was environmental, not logical.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the multi-line input string into a grid (list of lists) of integers.
2.  Generate a new grid containing only the unique rows from the input grid. Maintain the relative order of these rows based on when they first appeared in the input grid.
3.  From this grid of unique rows, take the first row and extract its first two integer elements. This forms the first row of the output.
4.  From the grid of unique rows, take the second row and extract its first two integer elements. This forms the second row of the output.
5.  Combine the two extracted rows to create the final 2x2 output grid.
6.  Format the 2x2 output grid into a string, with integers in each row separated by spaces and the two rows separated by a newline character.
