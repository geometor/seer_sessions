The core logic proposed was: 1) Parse the input grid, 2) Find unique rows while preserving the order of first appearance, 3) Extract the top-left 2x2 subgrid from the unique rows, 4) Format the output.\n\nTo confirm this logic, I will manually apply it to each training example.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\n*   **Train 1:**\n    *   Input Rows: 8\n    *   Input Columns: 8\n    *   Unique Rows (in order of first appearance):\n        "
