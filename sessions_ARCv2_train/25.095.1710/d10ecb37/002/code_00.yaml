actions:
  - action: parse_input
    description: Convert the input string representation into a list of lists (grid) of integers.
  - action: identify_unique_rows
    input: input_grid
    output: unique_rows_grid
    description: Iterate through the input_grid rows, adding each row to unique_rows_grid only if it hasn't been seen before, maintaining the order of first appearance.
  - action: extract_subgrid
    input: unique_rows_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Select the elements from the first two rows and first two columns of the unique_rows_grid.
  - action: format_output
    input: output_grid
    description: Convert the 2x2 output_grid back into a string format with space-separated integers and newline-separated rows.
relationships:
  - relation: derivation
    from: input_grid
    to: unique_rows_grid
    description: unique_rows_grid is derived by filtering duplicate rows from input_grid while preserving the order of first appearance.
  - relation: selection
    from: unique_rows_grid
    to: output_grid
    description: output_grid consists of the top-left 2x2 elements of the unique_rows_grid.
