Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input:** The input is a multi-line string representing a grid of single-digit integers. The grid dimensions (rows and columns) can vary between examples. The input grids can contain duplicate rows.
*   **Output:** The output is always a 2x2 grid represented as a multi-line string, with space-separated integers.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve selecting specific elements from the input grid to form the output grid. The presence of duplicate rows in the input suggests that uniqueness might play a role. The output consistently takes elements from the top-left portion of some structure derived from the input.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - content: single-digit integers
      - structure: rows and columns
      - constraints: variable dimensions, can contain duplicate rows
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - content: single-digit integers
      - structure: 2 rows, 2 columns
      - constraints: fixed dimensions (2x2)
actions:
  - action: parse_input
    description: Convert the input string into a list of lists representing the grid.
  - action: identify_unique_rows
    description: Filter the input grid to keep only the unique rows, preserving the order of their first appearance.
  - action: extract_subgrid
    description: Select the top-left 2x2 section from the unique rows.
  - action: format_output
    description: Convert the extracted 2x2 grid back into the required string format.
relationships:
  - relation: source_of_output
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    description: The output grid's elements are derived from the top-left 2x2 portion of the unique rows (in order of appearance) of the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input string and parse it into a grid of integers, where each inner list represents a row.
2.  Create a new list to store the unique rows encountered so far, maintaining the order in which they first appear in the input grid. Iterate through the rows of the input grid; if a row is not already in the unique rows list, add it.
3.  Take the first unique row from the list generated in step 2 and extract its first two integer elements. These form the first row of the output grid.
4.  Take the second unique row from the list generated in step 2 and extract its first two integer elements. These form the second row of the output grid.
5.  Combine these two rows to form the final 2x2 output grid.
6.  Format the 2x2 output grid into a string with space-separated integers within rows and a newline character separating the rows.
