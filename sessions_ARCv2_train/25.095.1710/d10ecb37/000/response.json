The grid dimensions (rows and columns) can vary between examples. The input grids can contain duplicate rows.\n*   **Output:** The output is always a 2x2 grid represented as a multi-line string, with space-separated integers.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve selecting specific elements from the input grid to form the output grid. The presence of duplicate rows in the input suggests that uniqueness might play a role. The output consistently takes elements from the top-left portion of some structure derived from the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
