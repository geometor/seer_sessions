Objects:
  - InputGrid:
      Properties:
        - type: grid
        - elements: integers (always 0)
        - dimensions:
            - height: variable (e.g., 5, 4, 5, 3)
            - width: variable (e.g., 4, 3, 6, 3)
  - OutputGrid:
      Properties:
        - type: grid
        - elements: integers (0 or 8)
        - dimensions: same as InputGrid
  - Cell:
      Properties:
        - value: integer (0 or 8)
        - position:
            - row_index: integer
            - column_index: integer
Relationships:
  - OutputGrid is derived from InputGrid.
  - Cells belong to a Grid.
  - Cells on the perimeter of the OutputGrid have a value of 8.
  - Cells in the interior of the OutputGrid have a value of 0.
Actions:
  - Identify the dimensions (height, width) of the InputGrid.
  - Create an OutputGrid with the same dimensions.
  - For each Cell in the grid:
      - Determine if the Cell's position is on the border (first row, last row, first column, or last column).
      - If the Cell is on the border, set its value in the OutputGrid to 8.
      - If the Cell is not on the border (i.e., it's in the interior), set its value in the OutputGrid to the corresponding value from the InputGrid (which is 0).
