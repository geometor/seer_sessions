The output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids. The output grids feature the digit `8` forming a rectangular border, while the interior cells retain the digit `0`. The transformation essentially draws a frame or border using the digit `8` around the original grid content (which is uniformly `0`).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
