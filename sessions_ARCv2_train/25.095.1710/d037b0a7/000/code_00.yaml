task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  cell_type: integer
  cell_range: 0-9
  size: 3x3 (based on examples)
objects:
  - grid: a 2D array of integers.
  - cell: an individual element within the grid, identified by row and column index.
  - value: the integer content of a cell (can be zero or non-zero).
properties:
  - position: (row, column) coordinates of a cell.
  - value: the integer digit within a cell.
actions:
  - propagate_down: A non-zero value in a cell replaces a zero value in the cell directly below it within the same column. This action repeats iteratively.
relationships:
  - above/below: Cells in the same column but adjacent rows.
  - column_membership: Cells sharing the same column index.
transformation_rule:
  - For each column, non-zero values "fall" downwards, filling in any zero cells below them.
  - The propagation continues until all zeros below a non-zero value in a column are filled by that value, or until the bottom of the grid is reached.
  - If a cell is initially zero but gets filled by a value falling from above, that value continues to fall further down the column if there are more zeros below.
