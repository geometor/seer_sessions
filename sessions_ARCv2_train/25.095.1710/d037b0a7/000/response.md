**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 2D grid of single-digit integers. The input grids contain both zeros and non-zero digits. The output grids are modifications of the input grids where some or all of the zeros have been replaced by non-zero digits. The transformation seems constrained to columns; values appear to propagate downwards within their columns.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  cell_type: integer
  cell_range: 0-9
  size: 3x3 (based on examples)
objects:
  - grid: a 2D array of integers.
  - cell: an individual element within the grid, identified by row and column index.
  - value: the integer content of a cell (can be zero or non-zero).
properties:
  - position: (row, column) coordinates of a cell.
  - value: the integer digit within a cell.
actions:
  - propagate_down: A non-zero value in a cell replaces a zero value in the cell directly below it within the same column. This action repeats iteratively.
relationships:
  - above/below: Cells in the same column but adjacent rows.
  - column_membership: Cells sharing the same column index.
transformation_rule:
  - For each column, non-zero values "fall" downwards, filling in any zero cells below them.
  - The propagation continues until all zeros below a non-zero value in a column are filled by that value, or until the bottom of the grid is reached.
  - If a cell is initially zero but gets filled by a value falling from above, that value continues to fall further down the column if there are more zeros below.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the grid multiple times (enough times to ensure full propagation, e.g., the height of the grid times). In each iteration:
    a.  Scan the grid row by row, starting from the second row (index 1) to the last row.
    b.  For each cell `(r, c)` in the current scan:
        i.  Check if the value of the current cell `output[r][c]` is zero.
        ii. Check if the value of the cell directly above it, `output[r-1][c]`, is non-zero.
        iii. If both conditions are true, update the value of the current cell `output[r][c]` to be the value of the cell above it `output[r-1][c]`.
3.  After the iterations complete, the resulting grid is the final output.
