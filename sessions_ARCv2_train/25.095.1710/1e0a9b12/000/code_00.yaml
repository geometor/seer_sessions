Context: Grid Transformation Task

Objects:
  - name: Grid
    properties:
      - rows: Integer (number of rows)
      - columns: Integer (number of columns)
      - cells: List[List[Cell]]
  - name: Cell
    properties:
      - row_index: Integer
      - column_index: Integer
      - value: Integer (0-9)
  - name: Number
    properties:
      - value: Integer (1-9) # Non-zero value
      - initial_position: Tuple[Integer, Integer] # (row, column)
      - final_position: Tuple[Integer, Integer] # (row, column)
  - name: Column
    properties:
      - index: Integer
      - cells: List[Cell]
      - non_zero_values: List[Integer] # Ordered list of non-zero values from top to bottom

Relationships:
  - Grid contains Columns.
  - Grid contains Cells.
  - Columns contain Cells.
  - Numbers occupy Cells (at initial and final positions).

Actions:
  - Identify non-zero numbers within each column.
  - Determine the final resting position for each non-zero number based on gravity.
  - Reconstruct the output grid column by column.

Rule:
  - For each column in the input grid:
    1. Extract all non-zero numbers, preserving their top-to-bottom order.
    2. Create a new column of the same height, initially filled with zeros.
    3. Place the extracted non-zero numbers into the new column, starting from the bottom row and moving upwards, maintaining their preserved order.
  - Combine the newly created columns to form the output grid.
