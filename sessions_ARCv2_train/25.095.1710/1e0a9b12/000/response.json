Numbers originally higher up in a column will still be higher up relative to numbers originally lower in the same column, once they have all settled at the bottom.\n7.  **Independence:** The process applied to one column does not seem to directly affect the numbers or their final positions in other columns.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
