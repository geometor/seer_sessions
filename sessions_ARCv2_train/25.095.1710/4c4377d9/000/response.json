The output grids consistently have 6 rows and 4 columns, exactly double the height of the input. The numbers present in the output grid are the same as those in the input grid for each corresponding example. The structure of the output grid appears to be derived from stacking the rows of the input grid in a specific order. Specifically, the first half of the output grid (top 3 rows) consists of the input grid's rows in reverse order (bottom row first, top row last). The second half of the output grid (bottom 3 rows) consists of the input grid's rows in their original order (top row first, bottom row last).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
