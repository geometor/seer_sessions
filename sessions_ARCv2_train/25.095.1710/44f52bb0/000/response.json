The numbers present in the examples are 0 and 2.\n*   **Output:** The output is a single integer, either 1 or 7.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation maps a specific 3x3 grid pattern to either 1 or 7. The key seems to lie in the spatial arrangement of the numbers (specifically the '2's) within the grid.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
