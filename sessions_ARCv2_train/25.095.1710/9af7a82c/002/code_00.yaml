Input:
  type: grid
  description: A 2D array of integers.
  properties:
    rows: number of rows
    columns: number of columns
    elements: integer values, including zero

Output:
  type: grid
  description: A 2D array of integers, representing frequency information.
  properties:
    rows: Determined by the maximum frequency of any non-zero number in the input.
    columns: Determined by the count of unique non-zero numbers in the input.
    elements: Non-zero integers from the input, arranged in columns based on frequency, padded with zeros.

Transformation:
  actions:
    - action: count_frequencies
      description: Count occurrences of each unique non-zero integer in the input grid.
      inputs: input grid elements
      outputs: frequency map (number -> count)
    - action: find_max_frequency
      description: Determine the highest frequency count among all non-zero numbers.
      inputs: frequency map
      outputs: max_count
    - action: sort_unique_numbers
      description: >
        Get the unique non-zero integers from the input.
        Sort them first by frequency (descending) based on the initial counts,
        and then by the integer value (ascending) to break ties.
      inputs: frequency map
      outputs: sorted list of unique non-zero integers (defines column order)
    - action: determine_output_dimensions
      description: >
        Output rows = max_count.
        Output columns = number of unique non-zero integers.
      inputs: max_count, sorted list of unique non-zero integers
      outputs: output grid dimensions (rows, columns)
    - action: construct_output_grid
      description: >
        Create an output grid of the determined dimensions, initialized with zeros.
        Iterate through the sorted unique non-zero integers. For each integer `n` at sorted index `j` (column index):
        Fill column `j` from the top (row 0) downwards with the integer `n`.
        Repeat `n` a number of times equal to its initial frequency count.
      inputs: output grid dimensions, sorted unique non-zero integers, frequency map
      outputs: final output grid
