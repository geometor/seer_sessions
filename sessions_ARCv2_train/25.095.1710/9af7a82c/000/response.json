            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\nThe input is a grid of integers. The output is also a grid of integers, but typically with different dimensions than the input. The transformation seems to involve analyzing the frequency of non-zero numbers in the input grid and using this frequency information to construct the output grid.\n\n1.  **Input Analysis:** The core operation involves identifying all unique non-zero numbers present in the entire input grid and counting how many times each appears.\n2.  **Ordering:** The unique non-zero numbers seem to determine the columns of the output grid. Their order in the output columns is based on their frequency (count) in the input grid, arranged from most frequent to least frequent.\n3.  **Output Grid Construction:**\n    *   The number of columns in the output grid equals the number of unique non-zero integers found in the input.\n    *   The number of rows in the output grid depends on the maximum frequency of any single number and potentially the dimensions of the input grid.\n    *   Each column in the output corresponds to one of the unique non-zero input numbers (ordered by frequency). The column is populated vertically with that number, repeating it a number of times equal to its frequency count (with a potential modification in one specific case related to input dimensions). The remaining rows in that column are filled with zeros.\n4.  **Special Conditions:** There appear to be adjustments based on the input grid's dimensions:\n    *   The count for the *smallest* unique non-zero number is incremented if the input grid has more columns than rows.\n    *   The total number of rows in the output grid seems to be `max_count + 1`, unless the input grid has 4 columns, in which case it's `max_count + 2`.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
