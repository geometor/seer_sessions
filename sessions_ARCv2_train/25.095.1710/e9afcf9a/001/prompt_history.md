## train_1

**input:**
```
4 4 4 4 4 4
8 8 8 8 8 8
```


**output:**

4 8 4 8 4 8
8 4 8 4 8 4
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 3

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input consists of two lines, each containing a sequence of the same number repeated multiple times, separated by spaces. The length of the sequence appears consistent between the two input lines and across examples (6 elements in both provided examples).

The output also consists of two lines, each containing a sequence of numbers separated by spaces, with the same length as the input sequences. The numbers used in the output sequences are the two distinct numbers found in the input lines.

The first output line is formed by alternating the number from the first input line and the number from the second input line, starting with the number from the first input line.

The second output line is formed by alternating the number from the second input line and the number from the first input line, starting with the number from the second input line.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the two lines of input text.
2.  Identify the unique number present in the first input line (let's call it `num1`).
3.  Identify the unique number present in the second input line (let's call it `num2`).
4.  Determine the number of elements in the first input line (this is the sequence length, `n`).
5.  Create the first output sequence: start with `num1`, then `num2`, then `num1`, and so on, alternating until the sequence has `n` elements.
6.  Create the second output sequence: start with `num2`, then `num1`, then `num2`, and so on, alternating until the sequence has `n` elements.
7.  Format the first output sequence by joining its elements with single spaces.
8.  Format the second output sequence by joining its elements with single spaces.
9.  Combine the formatted first and second output sequences, separated by a newline character, to produce the final output.
