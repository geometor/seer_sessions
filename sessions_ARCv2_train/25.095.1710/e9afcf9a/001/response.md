"""
This transformation takes a 2-row grid where each row consists of repetitions 
of a single number. It produces a new 2-row grid of the same dimensions. 
The first output row alternates between the unique number from the first 
input row and the unique number from the second input row, starting with 
the first input row's number. The second output row does the same but 
starts with the second input row's number.

    Transforms a 2-row grid with repeated numbers into two alternating sequences.

    Args:
        input_grid: A list containing two lists of integers. 
                      Each inner list represents a row and contains repetitions 
                      of a single number.

    Returns:
        A list containing two lists of integers, representing the transformed grid.
        The first list alternates starting with the first input number.
        The second list alternates starting with the second input number.
