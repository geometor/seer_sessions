The length of the sequence appears consistent between the two input lines and across examples (6 elements in both provided examples).\n\nThe output also consists of two lines, each containing a sequence of numbers separated by spaces, with the same length as the input sequences. The numbers used in the output sequences are the two distinct numbers found in the input lines.\n\nThe first output line is formed by alternating the number from the first input line and the number from the second input line, starting with the number from the first input line.\n\nThe second output line is formed by alternating the number from the second input line and the number from the first input line, starting with the number from the second input line.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
