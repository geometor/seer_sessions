Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input is a 2D grid of integers (specifically, 3x3 in the examples).
    *   The output is also a 2D grid of integers, but larger (9x9 in the examples).
    *   There's a clear relationship between the input grid size and the output grid size: the output grid dimensions are 3 times the input grid dimensions (3 * 3 = 9).
    *   Each number (cell value) in the input grid seems to correspond to a 3x3 block of that same number in the output grid.
    *   The position of a number in the input grid determines the position of the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid. For an input cell at `(row, col)`, the corresponding output block starts at `(row * 3, col * 3)`.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    input_object:
      type: grid
      properties:
        element_type: integer
        size: M x N (e.g., 3x3)
    output_object:
      type: grid
      properties:
        element_type: integer
        size: (M*3) x (N*3) (e.g., 9x9)
    transformation:
      type: upscaling
      scale_factor: 3
      rule: Each cell in the input grid is expanded into a 3x3 block in the output grid.
    relationships:
      - input_cell:
          position: (r, c)
          value: v
      - output_block:
          top_left_corner: (r * 3, c * 3)
          size: 3x3
          value: All cells within the block have the value v
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the dimensions of the input grid (let's say `M` rows and `N` columns).
    2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions `(M * 3)` rows and `(N * 3)` columns.
    3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid, from `r = 0` to `M-1` and `c = 0` to `N-1`.
    4.  Get the value `v` of the input cell at `(r, c)`.
    5.  Identify the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid. This block spans rows `r * 3` to `r * 3 + 2` and columns `c * 3` to `c * 3 + 2`.
    6.  Fill all cells within this 3x3 output block with the value `v`.
    7.  Repeat steps 3-6 for all cells in the input grid.
    8.  The resulting grid is the final output.
