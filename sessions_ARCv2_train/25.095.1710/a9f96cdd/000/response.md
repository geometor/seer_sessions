Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are represented as 2D grids (matrices) of integers, specifically 3 rows by 5 columns.
*   **Input Content:** The input grids primarily consist of zeros, with exactly one cell containing the integer '2'. The position of this '2' varies across examples.
*   **Output Content:** The output grids also primarily consist of zeros. However, they contain specific non-zero integers (3, 6, 7, 8) placed in locations relative to the position of the '2' in the input grid. The original '2' is replaced by a '0' in the output.
*   **Transformation Pattern:** The non-zero values in the output appear diagonally adjacent to the position where the '2' was located in the input. There's a fixed mapping between the relative diagonal position and the value placed:
    *   Top-left diagonal: '3'
    *   Top-right diagonal: '6'
    *   Bottom-left diagonal: '8'
    *   Bottom-right diagonal: '7'
*   **Boundary Conditions:** If a calculated diagonal position falls outside the grid boundaries (e.g., row index < 0 or >= 3, or column index < 0 or >= 5), the corresponding value is not placed in the output grid.

  description: Place specific values in the output grid based on the location of the special value '2' in the input grid.
  steps:
    - Find the coordinates (row_in, col_in) of the value '2' in the input grid.
    - Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions with the background value '0'.
    - Define relative target offsets and their corresponding values:
        - offset_tl: { dr: -1, dc: -1, value: 3 } # Top-Left
        - offset_tr: { dr: -1, dc: +1, value: 6 } # Top-Right
        - offset_bl: { dr: +1, dc: -1, value: 8 } # Bottom-Left
        - offset_br: { dr: +1, dc: +1, value: 7 } # Bottom-Right
    - For each defined offset:
        - Calculate target coordinates: (row_out = row_in + dr, col_out = col_in + dc).
        - Check if (row_out, col_out) are within the grid boundaries (0 <= row_out < 3 and 0 <= col_out < 5).
        - If within boundaries, place the corresponding 'value' at (row_out, col_out) in the output grid.
relationships:
  - The position of '2' in the input determines the placement locations in the output.
  - Each output value (3, 6, 7, 8) corresponds to a specific diagonal direction relative to the input '2'.
  - The output grid dimensions are identical to the input grid dimensions.
  - Placement is conditional on the target coordinates being within grid bounds.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new 3x5 grid (the output grid) and fill it entirely with zeros.
2.  Scan the input 3x5 grid to find the row index (`r`) and column index (`c`) of the cell containing the value '2'.
3.  Calculate the coordinates for the top-left diagonal neighbor: (`r-1`, `c-1`). If these coordinates are valid (row is between 0 and 2, column is between 0 and 4), place the value '3' at this position in the output grid.
4.  Calculate the coordinates for the top-right diagonal neighbor: (`r-1`, `c+1`). If these coordinates are valid, place the value '6' at this position in the output grid.
5.  Calculate the coordinates for the bottom-left diagonal neighbor: (`r+1`, `c-1`). If these coordinates are valid, place the value '8' at this position in the output grid.
6.  Calculate the coordinates for the bottom-right diagonal neighbor: (`r+1`, `c+1`). If these coordinates are valid, place the value '7' at this position in the output grid.
7.  The final state of the new grid is the result.
