            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are represented as 2D grids (matrices) of integers, specifically 3 rows by 5 columns.\n*   **Input Content:** The input grids primarily consist of zeros, with exactly one cell containing the integer '2'. The position of this '2' varies across examples.\n*   **Output Content:** The output grids also primarily consist of zeros. However, they contain specific non-zero integers (3, 6, 7, 8) placed in locations relative to the position of the '2' in the input grid. The original '2' is replaced by a '0' in the output.\n*   **Transformation Pattern:** The non-zero values in the output appear diagonally adjacent to the position where the '2' was located in the input. There's a fixed mapping between the relative diagonal position and the value placed:\n    *   Top-left diagonal: '3'\n    *   Top-right diagonal: '6'\n    *   Bottom-left diagonal: '8'\n    *   Bottom-right diagonal: '7'\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** If a calculated diagonal position falls outside the grid boundaries (e.g., row index < 0 or >= 3, or column index < 0 or >= 5), the corresponding value is not placed in the output grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
