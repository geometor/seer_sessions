*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a 4x4 grid of digits into another 4x4 grid of digits. The output grid appears to be constructed quadrant by quadrant, specifically using 2x2 quadrants. The top half of the output grid is consistently filled with the digit '6'. The bottom half of the output grid is determined by examining the contents of the corresponding quadrants in the bottom half of the input grid. A specific digit, '2', seems to play a key role in determining the fill value for the bottom quadrants of the output.

    task_elements:
      - object: input_grid
        properties:
          - type: grid
          - dimensions: 4x4
          - cell_content: single digits
      - object: output_grid
        properties:
          - type: grid
          - dimensions: 4x4
          - cell_content: single digits
      - object: grid_quadrant
        properties:
          - type: subgrid
          - dimensions: 2x2
          - locations: [top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right]
      - constant: background_digit
        value: 6
      - constant: target_digit
        value: 2
    relationships:
      - output_grid top-left quadrant is always filled with background_digit (6).
      - output_grid top-right quadrant is always filled with background_digit (6).
      - output_grid bottom-left quadrant's fill value depends on the presence of target_digit (2) within the input_grid's bottom-left quadrant.
      - output_grid bottom-right quadrant's fill value depends on the presence of target_digit (2) within the input_grid's bottom-right quadrant.
    actions:
      - Divide the input and output grids into four 2x2 quadrants.
      - Fill the top-left and top-right output quadrants with the background_digit (6).
      - Check for the presence of the target_digit (2) in the input grid's bottom-left quadrant.
      - Fill the output grid's bottom-left quadrant with the target_digit (2) if present in the corresponding input quadrant, otherwise fill with the background_digit (6).
      - Check for the presence of the target_digit (2) in the input grid's bottom-right quadrant.
      - Fill the output grid's bottom-right quadrant with the target_digit (2) if present in the corresponding input quadrant, otherwise fill with the background_digit (6).

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a new 4x4 output grid.
    2.  Divide the output grid into four 2x2 quadrants: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right.
    3.  Fill the top-left quadrant of the output grid entirely with the digit '6'.
    4.  Fill the top-right quadrant of the output grid entirely with the digit '6'.
    5.  Examine the four cells within the bottom-left quadrant of the *input* grid (rows 2-3, columns 0-1).
    6.  If any of these four cells in the input contain the digit '2', then fill the entire bottom-left quadrant of the *output* grid with the digit '2'.
    7.  Otherwise (if no '2' is found in the input bottom-left quadrant), fill the entire bottom-left quadrant of the *output* grid with the digit '6'.
    8.  Examine the four cells within the bottom-right quadrant of the *input* grid (rows 2-3, columns 2-3).
    9.  If any of these four cells in the input contain the digit '2', then fill the entire bottom-right quadrant of the *output* grid with the digit '2'.
    10. Otherwise (if no '2' is found in the input bottom-right quadrant), fill the entire bottom-right quadrant of the *output* grid with the digit '6'.
