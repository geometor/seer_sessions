Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input:** The input is consistently a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers.
2.  **Output:** The output is consistently a 5x5 grid of single-digit integers.
3.  **Content:** The integers present in the output grid are exactly the same integers present in the corresponding input grid. No new numbers are introduced, and no input numbers are omitted.
4.  **Structure Transformation:** The core transformation involves expanding the 3x3 input grid into a 5x5 output grid. This expansion doesn't seem uniform; some rows/columns in the input seem to expand more than others in the output.
5.  **Expansion Pattern:**
    *   Observing the columns: The first input column's values appear in the first two output columns. The second input column's values appear in the third output column. The third input column's values appear in the last two output columns. This suggests a horizontal expansion pattern of (2, 1, 2).
    *   Observing the rows: The first input row's values, expanded horizontally as above, form the first two rows of the output. The second input row's values, expanded horizontally, form the third row of the output. The third input row's values, expanded horizontally, form the last two rows of the output. This suggests a vertical expansion pattern of (2, 1, 2).
6.  **Mapping:** Each cell `(r, c)` in the input grid corresponds to a rectangular block in the output grid. The value of the input cell `input[r][c]` populates this entire block. The dimensions and position of the block are determined by the expansion patterns (2, 1, 2) for both rows and columns.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Grid Expansion

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Dimensions: 3x3
  Element_Type: Integer

Output:
  Type: Grid
  Dimensions: 5x5
  Element_Type: Integer
  Origin: Derived from Input grid values.

Transformation:
  Action: Expansion
  Method: Cell-to-Block Mapping
  Horizontal_Expansion_Factors: [2, 1, 2] # Input column 0 -> Output cols 0-1; Input col 1 -> Output col 2; Input col 2 -> Output cols 3-4
  Vertical_Expansion_Factors: [2, 1, 2]   # Input row 0 -> Output rows 0-1; Input row 1 -> Output row 2; Input row 2 -> Output rows 3-4
  Rule: Each cell value from the input grid populates a rectangular block in the output grid, determined by the cumulative sum of expansion factors.

Example_Mapping (Train_1, input[1][2]=8):
  Input_Cell: [1, 2]
  Input_Value: 8
  Vertical_Mapping: Input row 1 maps to Output row 2 (cumulative factor: 2 -> row index 2)
  Horizontal_Mapping: Input column 2 maps to Output columns 3-4 (cumulative factor: 2+1=3 -> col indices 3, 4)
  Output_Block_Indices: row=2, cols=[3, 4] # Actually [2:3, 3:5] using slicing
  Output_Block_Value: 8
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty 5x5 output grid.
2.  Define the vertical expansion factors as `[2, 1, 2]` and horizontal expansion factors as `[2, 1, 2]`.
3.  Calculate the starting row indices for output blocks: `[0, 2, 3]`. (Cumulative sum of vertical factors, excluding the last)
4.  Calculate the starting column indices for output blocks: `[0, 2, 3]`. (Cumulative sum of horizontal factors, excluding the last)
5.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the 3x3 input grid, where `r` is the row index (0 to 2) and `c` is the column index (0 to 2).
6.  Get the value `v = input[r][c]`.
7.  Determine the target block dimensions: `height = vertical_expansion_factors[r]`, `width = horizontal_expansion_factors[c]`.
8.  Determine the top-left corner of the target block in the output grid: `start_row = starting_row_indices[r]`, `start_col = starting_column_indices[c]`.
9.  Fill the output grid block defined by rows `start_row` to `start_row + height - 1` and columns `start_col` to `start_col + width - 1` with the value `v`.
10. Return the completed 5x5 output grid.
