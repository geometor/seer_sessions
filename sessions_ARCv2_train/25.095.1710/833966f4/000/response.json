The length of the sequence remains the same.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation involves selectively swapping adjacent pairs of numbers based on their position (index) within the sequence and a specific comparison rule that alternates depending on the pair's position. Elements at certain indices (2, 5, 8, ...) seem to remain fixed relative to the pairs being swapped around them.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
