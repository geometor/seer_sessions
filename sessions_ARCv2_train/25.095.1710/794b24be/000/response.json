The transformation logic appears to depend not on the specific positions of the 1s in the input, but rather on the *total count* of 1s present in the input grid. The output grid seems to activate specific cells (changing them from 0 to 2) based on whether the count of 1s reaches certain thresholds. Specifically, the cells (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), and (1,1) in the output grid are conditionally set to 2.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
