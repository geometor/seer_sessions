Grid_Properties:
  - Input_Grid:
      Type: 2D Array (Matrix)
      Dimensions: 3x3
      Cell_Values: [0, 1]
  - Output_Grid:
      Type: 2D Array (Matrix)
      Dimensions: 3x3
      Cell_Values: [0, 2]

Objects:
  - Input_Grid: The source data structure.
  - Output_Grid: The target data structure.
  - Cell: Individual element within a grid.
  - Value: Integer number within a cell (0, 1, or 2).
  - Count_of_Ones: A derived property from the Input_Grid.

Relationships/Actions:
  - Counting: The total number of cells with value 1 in the Input_Grid is calculated.
  - Threshold_Comparison: The Count_of_Ones is compared against thresholds (1, 2, 3, 4).
  - Conditional_Assignment: Specific cells in the Output_Grid ((0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1)) are assigned the value 2 based on the results of the Threshold_Comparison.
  - Initialization: The Output_Grid is initialized with all 0s before conditional assignments.

Transformation_Rule_Summary:
  - The transformation maps the total count of 1s in the Input_Grid to the activation pattern (presence of 2s) in specific cells of the Output_Grid.
  - Output cell (0,0) becomes 2 if Count_of_Ones >= 1.
  - Output cell (0,1) becomes 2 if Count_of_Ones >= 2.
  - Output cell (0,2) becomes 2 if Count_of_Ones >= 3.
  - Output cell (1,1) becomes 2 if Count_of_Ones >= 4.
  - All other Output_Grid cells remain 0.
