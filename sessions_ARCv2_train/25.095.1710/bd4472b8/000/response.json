The dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the output grid are identical to the input grid for each example.\n2.  **Row Copying:** The first two rows of the input grid are consistently copied verbatim to the first two rows of the output grid.\n3.  **Source Sequence Identification:** The first row of the input grid serves as a source sequence of values.\n4.  **Row Filling Pattern:** Starting from the third row (index 2) of the output grid, each row is populated based on the source sequence derived from the first input row.\n5.  **Cyclical Filling:** The values from the source sequence are used one by one, cyclically, to fill entire rows in the output grid. The first value from the source sequence fills the third output row entirely, the second value fills the fourth output row, and so on. If the end of the source sequence is reached, it wraps around to the beginning.\n6.  **Value Replication:** The selected value from the source sequence for a given output row is replicated across all columns of that row.\n7.  **Input Ignored Data:** The content of the input grid from the third row onwards does not influence the output and appears to be ignored.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
