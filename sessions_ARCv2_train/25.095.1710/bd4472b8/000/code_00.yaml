task_elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - content: integers
      - rows: variable (e.g., 10, 8, 6)
      - columns: variable (e.g., 4, 3, 2)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - content: integers
      - rows: same as input_grid
      - columns: same as input_grid
  - object: source_sequence
    properties:
      - derived_from: first row of input_grid
      - content: sequence of integers
      - length: equal to columns of input_grid
  - relationship: row_correspondence
    description: First two rows of output_grid are identical copies of the first two rows of input_grid.
  - action: fill_rows
    source: source_sequence
    target: output_grid rows starting from index 2
    details:
      - rule: cyclical pattern
      - index_mapping: Output row `i` (for `i >= 2`) uses element `(i - 2) % length(source_sequence)` from source_sequence.
      - value_application: The selected element fills all columns of the target output row.
  - observation: Input grid data from row index 2 onwards is not used in the transformation.
