```python
"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rules:
1. Copies the first two rows of the input grid directly to the output grid.
2. Uses the first row of the input grid as a 'source sequence'.
3. For each subsequent row in the output grid (starting from the third row, index 2), it determines a value from the source sequence using a cyclical pattern based on the row index.
4. Fills the entire output row with this selected value, replicating it across all columns.
The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid. Input grid data from the third row onwards is ignored.

# No external libraries are needed for this transformation.
