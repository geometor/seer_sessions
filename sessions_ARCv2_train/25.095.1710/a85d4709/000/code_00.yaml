task_description: Maps the position of a unique non-zero element in each input row to a specific uniform value for the corresponding output row.

input_grid:
  type: object
  properties:
    format: 3x3 grid of integers
    cell_values: [0, 5]
    row_constraint: Each row contains exactly one '5' and two '0's.

output_grid:
  type: object
  properties:
    format: 3x3 grid of integers
    cell_values: [2, 3, 4]
    row_constraint: Each row contains three identical integers.

transformation:
  scope: row-wise
  rule: The value filling an output row depends on the column index of the '5' in the corresponding input row.
  mapping:
    input_row_pattern: [5, 0, 0] # '5' at index 0
    output_row_value: 2
  mapping:
    input_row_pattern: [0, 5, 0] # '5' at index 1
    output_row_value: 4
  mapping:
    input_row_pattern: [0, 0, 5] # '5' at index 2
    output_row_value: 3

relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions match the input grid dimensions.
  - Each output row is derived independently from its corresponding input row.
  - The column index of the '5' in an input row determines the uniform value of the corresponding output row.
