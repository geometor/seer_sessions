The other two integers in the row are 0.\n3.  **Output Content:** Each row in the output grid consists of three identical integers. The value of this integer varies between rows.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to operate independently on each row of the input grid to produce the corresponding row in the output grid.\n5.  **Key Relationship:** The value used to fill the output row seems to be determined solely by the *column index* (position) of the number 5 within the corresponding input row.\n6.  **Mapping Rule:**\n    *   If the 5 is in the first column (index 0) of the input row, the output row is filled with 2s.\n    *   If the 5 is in the second column (index 1) of the input row, the output row is filled with 4s.\n    *   If the 5 is in the third column (index 2) of the input row, the output row is filled with 3s.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
