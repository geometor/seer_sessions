The output is always a 2x2 grid, also represented as space-separated strings. The core task is to extract a specific 2x2 subgrid from the input grid.\n\nObserving the examples:\n1.  **train_1:** Input is 4x4. Output is the top-right 2x2 subgrid (`[[8, 2], [4, 7]]`).\n2.  **train_2:** Input is 3x3. Output is the top-left 2x2 subgrid (`[[0, 7], [5, 6]]`).\n3.  **train_3:** Input is 5x5. Output is the top-left 2x2 subgrid (`[[5, 8], [8, 0]]`).\n\nA pattern emerges based on the dimensions of the input grid. Specifically, the parity (evenness or oddness) of the number of rows seems to determine which 2x2 subgrid is extracted. If the number of rows is even (train_1), the top-right 2x2 subgrid is taken. If the number of rows is odd (train_2, train_3), the top-left 2x2 subgrid is taken.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
