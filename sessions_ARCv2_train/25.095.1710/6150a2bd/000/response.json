Comparing the input and output grids, the numbers themselves remain the same, but their locations change. The pattern suggests a spatial transformation, specifically a 180-degree rotation of the entire grid. The element originally at the top-left corner moves to the bottom-right, the element at the top-right moves to the bottom-left, the center element stays in place (though this isn't explicitly tested with a non-zero center element), and so on.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
