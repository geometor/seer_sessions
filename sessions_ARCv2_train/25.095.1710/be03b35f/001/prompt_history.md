Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** The input is always a 5x5 grid containing integers 0, 1, and 2.
*   **Output:** The output is always a 2x2 grid containing integers 0 and 1.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   The number '0' likely represents a background or empty state.
    *   The number '1' likely represents a primary pattern element.
    *   The number '2' appears consistently in a 2x2 block in the input examples. This block seems to act as a marker or locator.
*   **Relationship:** The output 2x2 grid seems to be derived from a specific 2x2 region within the input grid. The location of the 2x2 block of '2's appears crucial in determining *which* 2x2 region from the input contributes to the output and *how* it's transformed.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the 2x2 subgrid within the 5x5 input grid that is composed entirely of the value '2'. Record the row and column index of its top-left cell (let's call them `marker_row` and `marker_col`).
2.  Calculate the coordinates for a "source" 2x2 subgrid: the row index is `marker_row`, and the column index is `marker_col - 3`.
3.  Extract the 2x2 subgrid from the input grid starting at these calculated source coordinates.
4.  Rotate the extracted 2x2 source subgrid 90 degrees clockwise.
5.  The resulting rotated 2x2 grid is the final output.
