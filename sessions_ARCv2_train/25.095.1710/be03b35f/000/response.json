This block seems to act as a marker or locator.\n*   **Relationship:** The output 2x2 grid seems to be derived from a specific 2x2 region within the input grid. The location of the 2x2 block of '2's appears crucial in determining *which* 2x2 region from the input contributes to the output and *how* it's transformed.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
