objects:
  MarkerBlock:
    type: Subgrid
    based_on: InputGrid
    rows: 2
    columns: 2
    constraint: All cells must contain the value 2.
    properties:
      location: Top-left coordinates (row, column) within InputGrid.
    description: A 2x2 block of '2's acting as a locator. Assumed unique.
  SourceBlock:
    type: Subgrid
    based_on: InputGrid
    rows: 2
    columns: 2
    constraint: Cells contain only values 0 or 1.
    properties:
      location: Top-left coordinates (row, column) within InputGrid.
    description: The 2x2 block containing the pattern to be transformed into the output.
relationships:
  - type: Positional Dependency
    subject: SourceBlock
    object: MarkerBlock
    details: The top-left corner of the SourceBlock is located at the same row as the MarkerBlock, but 3 columns to the left. (Source.row = Marker.row, Source.col = Marker.col - 3)
actions:
  - name: LocateMarker
    input: InputGrid
    output: MarkerBlock location (row, col)
    description: Find the top-left coordinates of the 2x2 MarkerBlock.
  - name: DetermineSourceLocation
    input: MarkerBlock location (row, col)
    output: SourceBlock location (source_row, source_col)
    calculation: source_row = row, source_col = col - 3
    description: Calculate the location of the SourceBlock based on the MarkerBlock.
  - name: ExtractSource
    input: InputGrid, SourceBlock location (source_row, source_col)
    output: SourceBlock (2x2 grid of 0s and 1s)
    description: Extract the 2x2 subgrid from the InputGrid at the calculated SourceBlock location.
  - name: RotateSource
    input: SourceBlock
    output: OutputGrid
    transformation: Rotate 90 degrees clockwise.
    description: Transform the SourceBlock into the OutputGrid by rotation.
