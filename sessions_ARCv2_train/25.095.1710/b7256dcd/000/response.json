            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of integers. The size of the grid can vary (5x5 in train_1, 6x4 in train_2).\n2.  **Cell Values:** The grids contain integer values. The number 7 appears frequently and seems to act as a stable background or boundary element; it never changes its value or position.\n3.  **Active Elements:** Numbers other than 7 (e.g., 1, 3, 4, 6) are the ones subject to transformation.\n4.  **Connectivity:** The transformation appears to operate on connected components of non-7 numbers. Connectivity is defined by adjacent cells (up, down, left, right - Von Neumann neighborhood). A component is a group of non-7 cells where you can reach any cell in the group from any other cell by moving between adjacent non-7 cells.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The final value of a cell depends on the properties of the connected component it belongs to. Key properties identified are:\n    *   The size (number of cells) of the component.\n    *   The set of unique numbers present within the component.\n    *   The minimum numerical value within the component.\n6.  **Specific Rules Observed:**\n    *   Components of size 1 change to 7.\n    *   Components containing only the number 6 change based on size (size 4 remains 6, size 5 becomes 4).\n    *   In components with multiple distinct numbers, the cell(s) containing the minimum value change to 7, while other cells in that component change to the minimum value.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
