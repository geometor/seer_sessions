Elements:
  - Grid:
      description: A 2D array of integers representing the input and output states.
      properties:
        - dimensions: [rows, columns] (variable)
        - cells: Contains integer values.
  - Cell:
      description: An individual unit within the grid.
      properties:
        - value: Integer.
        - position: [row, column].
        - type: Can be 'background' (value 7) or 'active' (value != 7).
  - Connected Component:
      description: A group of adjacent 'active' cells (using Von Neumann neighborhood).
      properties:
        - cells: A set of cell positions belonging to the component.
        - size: The number of cells in the component.
        - unique_values: The set of distinct integer values present in the component's cells.
        - min_value: The minimum integer value among the component's cells.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Cells are adjacent if they share an edge (up, down, left, right).
  - Membership: An 'active' cell belongs to exactly one Connected Component.

Transformation:
  description: Modifies the values of 'active' cells based on the properties of their Connected Component.
  rules:
    - Background cells (value 7) remain unchanged.
    - Active cells are processed based on their component's properties (size, unique_values, min_value).
