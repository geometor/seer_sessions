Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of integers. The size of the grid can vary (5x5 in train_1, 6x4 in train_2).
2.  **Cell Values:** The grids contain integer values. The number 7 appears frequently and seems to act as a stable background or boundary element; it never changes its value or position.
3.  **Active Elements:** Numbers other than 7 (e.g., 1, 3, 4, 6) are the ones subject to transformation.
4.  **Connectivity:** The transformation appears to operate on connected components of non-7 numbers. Connectivity is defined by adjacent cells (up, down, left, right - Von Neumann neighborhood). A component is a group of non-7 cells where you can reach any cell in the group from any other cell by moving between adjacent non-7 cells.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The final value of a cell depends on the properties of the connected component it belongs to. Key properties identified are:
    *   The size (number of cells) of the component.
    *   The set of unique numbers present within the component.
    *   The minimum numerical value within the component.
6.  **Specific Rules Observed:**
    *   Components of size 1 change to 7.
    *   Components containing only the number 6 change based on size (size 4 remains 6, size 5 becomes 4).
    *   In components with multiple distinct numbers, the cell(s) containing the minimum value change to 7, while other cells in that component change to the minimum value.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
Elements:
  - Grid:
      description: A 2D array of integers representing the input and output states.
      properties:
        - dimensions: [rows, columns] (variable)
        - cells: Contains integer values.
  - Cell:
      description: An individual unit within the grid.
      properties:
        - value: Integer.
        - position: [row, column].
        - type: Can be 'background' (value 7) or 'active' (value != 7).
  - Connected Component:
      description: A group of adjacent 'active' cells (using Von Neumann neighborhood).
      properties:
        - cells: A set of cell positions belonging to the component.
        - size: The number of cells in the component.
        - unique_values: The set of distinct integer values present in the component's cells.
        - min_value: The minimum integer value among the component's cells.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Cells are adjacent if they share an edge (up, down, left, right).
  - Membership: An 'active' cell belongs to exactly one Connected Component.

Transformation:
  description: Modifies the values of 'active' cells based on the properties of their Connected Component.
  rules:
    - Background cells (value 7) remain unchanged.
    - Active cells are processed based on their component's properties (size, unique_values, min_value).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all connected components of cells having values other than 7. Use adjacency based on shared edges (up, down, left, right neighbours). Treat cells with value 7 as boundaries.
3.  For each identified connected component:
    a.  Determine the `size` (number of cells) of the component.
    b.  Determine the set of `unique_values` present in the component.
    c.  Determine the `min_value` among the cells in the component.
    d.  Apply transformation rules to each cell `(r, c)` with original value `v` within this component:
        i.  **Rule 1 (Size 1):** If `size` is 1, update the output grid at `(r, c)` to 7.
        ii. **Rule 2 (Size 4, only 6s):** If `size` is 4 AND `unique_values` is exactly `{6}`, the output value at `(r, c)` remains 6 (no change needed as output started as a copy).
        iii. **Rule 3 (Size 5, only 6s):** If `size` is 5 AND `unique_values` is exactly `{6}`, update the output grid at `(r, c)` to 4.
        iv. **Rule 4 (Minimum Value Cell):** If the component does not match Rule 2 or Rule 3, AND the cell's original value `v` is equal to `min_value`, update the output grid at `(r, c)` to 7.
        v.  **Rule 5 (Other Cells in Mixed Component):** If the component does not match Rule 1, 2, or 3, AND the cell's original value `v` is NOT equal to `min_value`, update the output grid at `(r, c)` to `min_value`.
4.  Return the modified output grid.

Okay, let's reassess the transformation based on the provided examples and the results from the previous code attempt.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core concept of operating on connected components of non-7 cells. However, the specific rules for transforming the values within these components were inaccurate, leading to the failure on `train_1`. The key observations are:

1.  The number 7 acts as a static background/boundary.
2.  The transformation depends on the properties of the connected component a cell belongs to: primarily its `size` and the `unique values` it contains.
3.  Special rules apply for components of certain sizes consisting solely of the value 6.
4.  A "general rule" applies to components with mixed values or sizes not covered by the special rules. This general rule appears more complex than initially thought, especially when more than two unique non-7 values are present.
5.  The failure on `train_1` was due to incorrectly applying the general rule. The component in `train_1` has three unique values (3, 4, 6), which seems to trigger a different behavior than the component in `train_2` with only two unique values (1, 6).

**Strategy:**

1.  Re-analyze the components in both training examples using the provided `code_execution` output to ensure accuracy.
2.  Formulate specific rules for components based on size *and* content (e.g., "Size 4, all 6s").
3.  Develop distinct "general" rules based on the *number* of unique values within the component (e.g., one rule for 2 unique values, another for 3+ unique values).
4.  The rule for 3+ unique values seems to involve the minimum and second-minimum values and potentially the distance to cells holding these values.
5.  Update the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect this more nuanced understanding.

**Metrics and Component Analysis (from `code_execution`)**

*   **Train 1:**
    *   **Component 1:** Size 9, Unique Values [3, 4, 6], Min Value 3, Second Min Value 4.
        *   Cells: `[((0, 1), 6), ((0, 2), 6), ((0, 3), 3), ((1, 3), 4), ((2, 3), 6), ((3, 2), 6), ((3, 3), 6), ((3, 4), 6), ((4, 3), 6)]`
        *   Expected Output: `{ (0,1):3, (0,2):3, (0,3):7, (1,3):7, (2,3):4, (3,2):4, (3,3):4, (3,4):4, (4,3):4 }`
        *   *Rule Applied (Hypothesized):* Rule G3 (General - 3+ Unique Values) - Cells with min (3) or second min (4) become 7. Others become min (3) if closer to an original min cell, otherwise second min (4).

*   **Train 2:**
    *   **Component 1:** Size 4, Unique Values [6], Min Value 6.
        *   Cells: `[((0, 3), 6), ((1, 2), 6), ((1, 3), 6), ((2, 2), 6)]`
        *   Expected Output: `{ (0,3):6, (1,2):6, (1,3):6, (2,2):6 }`
        *   *Rule Applied (Hypothesized):* Rule S4 (Size 4, All 6s).
    *   **Component 2:** Size 1, Unique Values [3], Min Value 3.
        *   Cells: `[((1, 0), 3)]`
        *   Expected Output: `{ (1,0):7 }`
        *   *Rule Applied (Hypothesized):* Rule S1 (Size 1, Not 6).
    *   **Component 3:** Size 5, Unique Values [1, 6], Min Value 1.
        *   Cells: `[((4, 0), 1), ((4, 1), 6), ((4, 2), 6), ((4, 3), 6), ((5, 2), 6)]`
        *   Expected Output: `{ (4,0):7, (4,1):1, (4,2):1, (4,3):1, (5,2):1 }`
        *   *Rule Applied (Hypothesized):* Rule G2 (General - 2 Unique Values).

  - Apply Rule: Select the appropriate rule (S1-S5, G2, G3) based on component properties.
  - Update Grid: Modify the output grid according to the logic of the selected rule for all cells in the component.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Create a `visited` grid of the same dimensions, initialized to `False`.
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the `input_grid`:
    a.  If the cell `(r, c)` contains a value other than 7 AND has not been `visited`:
        i.  Perform a search (e.g., BFS) starting from `(r, c)` to find all connected cells `(nr, nc)` with values other than 7, marking them as `visited`. Store these as the `component_cells` (including their original coordinates and values).
        ii. Calculate the component's properties:
            *   `size`: The total number of cells in `component_cells`.
            *   `unique_values`: The sorted list of unique original values from `component_cells`.
            *   `min_val`: The first element of `unique_values`.
            *   `min_cells`: The set of coordinates `(nr, nc)` from `component_cells` where the original value was `min_val`.
            *   `second_min_val`: (If `len(unique_values) >= 2`) The second element of `unique_values`.
            *   `second_min_cells`: (If `len(unique_values) >= 2`) The set of coordinates `(nr, nc)` from `component_cells` where the original value was `second_min_val`.
        iii. Determine the transformation rule to apply based on component properties:
            *   **If Rule S1 applies (`size == 1`):**
                *   Set the output value for the single cell to 6 if `unique_values == [6]`, otherwise set it to 7.
            *   **Else if Rule S2 applies (`size == 2` and `unique_values == [6]`):**
                *   Set the output value for both cells to 3.
            *   **Else if Rule S3 applies (`size == 3` and `unique_values == [6]`):**
                *   Set the output value for all cells to 6 (no change needed from copy).
            *   **Else if Rule S4 applies (`size == 4` and `unique_values == [6]`):**
                *   Set the output value for all cells to 6 (no change needed from copy).
            *   **Else if Rule S5 applies (`size == 5` and `unique_values == [6]`):**
                *   Set the output value for all cells to 4.
            *   **Else if Rule G2 applies (`len(unique_values) == 2`):**
                *   For each cell `((cr, cc), v)` in `component_cells`:
                    *   If `v == min_val`, set `output_grid[cr][cc] = 7`.
                    *   Else, set `output_
