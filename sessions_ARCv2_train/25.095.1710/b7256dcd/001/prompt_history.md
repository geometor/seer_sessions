Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of integers. The size of the grid can vary (5x5 in train_1, 6x4 in train_2).
2.  **Cell Values:** The grids contain integer values. The number 7 appears frequently and seems to act as a stable background or boundary element; it never changes its value or position.
3.  **Active Elements:** Numbers other than 7 (e.g., 1, 3, 4, 6) are the ones subject to transformation.
4.  **Connectivity:** The transformation appears to operate on connected components of non-7 numbers. Connectivity is defined by adjacent cells (up, down, left, right - Von Neumann neighborhood). A component is a group of non-7 cells where you can reach any cell in the group from any other cell by moving between adjacent non-7 cells.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The final value of a cell depends on the properties of the connected component it belongs to. Key properties identified are:
    *   The size (number of cells) of the component.
    *   The set of unique numbers present within the component.
    *   The minimum numerical value within the component.
6.  **Specific Rules Observed:**
    *   Components of size 1 change to 7.
    *   Components containing only the number 6 change based on size (size 4 remains 6, size 5 becomes 4).
    *   In components with multiple distinct numbers, the cell(s) containing the minimum value change to 7, while other cells in that component change to the minimum value.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
Elements:
  - Grid:
      description: A 2D array of integers representing the input and output states.
      properties:
        - dimensions: [rows, columns] (variable)
        - cells: Contains integer values.
  - Cell:
      description: An individual unit within the grid.
      properties:
        - value: Integer.
        - position: [row, column].
        - type: Can be 'background' (value 7) or 'active' (value != 7).
  - Connected Component:
      description: A group of adjacent 'active' cells (using Von Neumann neighborhood).
      properties:
        - cells: A set of cell positions belonging to the component.
        - size: The number of cells in the component.
        - unique_values: The set of distinct integer values present in the component's cells.
        - min_value: The minimum integer value among the component's cells.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Cells are adjacent if they share an edge (up, down, left, right).
  - Membership: An 'active' cell belongs to exactly one Connected Component.

Transformation:
  description: Modifies the values of 'active' cells based on the properties of their Connected Component.
  rules:
    - Background cells (value 7) remain unchanged.
    - Active cells are processed based on their component's properties (size, unique_values, min_value).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all connected components of cells having values other than 7. Use adjacency based on shared edges (up, down, left, right neighbours). Treat cells with value 7 as boundaries.
3.  For each identified connected component:
    a.  Determine the `size` (number of cells) of the component.
    b.  Determine the set of `unique_values` present in the component.
    c.  Determine the `min_value` among the cells in the component.
    d.  Apply transformation rules to each cell `(r, c)` with original value `v` within this component:
        i.  **Rule 1 (Size 1):** If `size` is 1, update the output grid at `(r, c)` to 7.
        ii. **Rule 2 (Size 4, only 6s):** If `size` is 4 AND `unique_values` is exactly `{6}`, the output value at `(r, c)` remains 6 (no change needed as output started as a copy).
        iii. **Rule 3 (Size 5, only 6s):** If `size` is 5 AND `unique_values` is exactly `{6}`, update the output grid at `(r, c)` to 4.
        iv. **Rule 4 (Minimum Value Cell):** If the component does not match Rule 2 or Rule 3, AND the cell's original value `v` is equal to `min_value`, update the output grid at `(r, c)` to 7.
        v.  **Rule 5 (Other Cells in Mixed Component):** If the component does not match Rule 1, 2, or 3, AND the cell's original value `v` is NOT equal to `min_value`, update the output grid at `(r, c)` to `min_value`.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
