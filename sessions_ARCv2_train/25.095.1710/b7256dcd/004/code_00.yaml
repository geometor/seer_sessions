Elements:
  - Grid:
      description: A 2D array of integers.
      properties:
        - dimensions: [rows, columns]
        - cells: Contains integer values.
  - Cell:
      description: An individual unit within the grid.
      properties:
        - value: Integer.
        - position: [row, column].
        - type: 'background' (value 7) or 'active' (value != 7).
  - Connected Component:
      description: A group of adjacent 'active' cells (Von Neumann neighborhood).
      properties:
        - cells: Set of ((row, col), value) tuples belonging to the component.
        - size: The number of cells in the component.
        - unique_values: Sorted list of distinct integer values present in the component's cells.
        - min_value: The minimum integer value among the component's cells.
        - second_min_value: The second minimum integer value (if len(unique_values) >= 2).
        - min_value_cells: Set of coordinates (r, c) where the original value was min_value.
        - second_min_value_cells: Set of coordinates (r, c) where the original value was second_min_value.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Cells are adjacent if they share an edge.
  - Membership: An 'active' cell belongs to exactly one Connected Component.
  - Distance: Manhattan distance between cells within a component, considering only paths through component cells.

Transformation:
  description: Modifies the values of 'active' cells based on the properties and rules associated with their Connected Component. Background cells (value 7) remain unchanged.
  rules:
    - Rule S1 (Size 1): Applied if component size is 1.
    - Rule S2 (Size 2, All 6s): Applied if component size is 2 and unique_values is [6].
    - Rule S3 (Size 3, All 6s): Applied if component size is 3 and unique_values is [6].
    - Rule S4 (Size 4, All 6s): Applied if component size is 4 and unique_values is [6].
    - Rule S5 (Size 5, All 6s): Applied if component size is 5 and unique_values is [6].
    - Rule G2 (General - 2 Unique Values): Applied if none of S1-S5 match and len(unique_values) is 2.
    - Rule G3 (General - 3+ Unique Values): Applied if none of S1-S5 match and len(unique_values) is 3 or more.

Actions:
  - Find Components: Identify all connected components of non-7 cells.
  - Calculate Properties: For each component, determine size, unique_values, min_value, second_min_value, and identify cells holding min/second_min values.
  - Calculate Distances (for Rule G3): For cells not holding min/second_min, find the shortest distance within the component to a min_value_cell and a second_min_value_cell.
  - Apply Rule: Select the appropriate rule (S1-S5, G2, G3) based on component properties.
  - Update Grid: Modify the output grid according to the logic of the selected rule for all cells in the component.
