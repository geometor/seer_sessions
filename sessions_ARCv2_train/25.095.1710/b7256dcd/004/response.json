            "text": "Okay, let's reassess the transformation based on the provided examples and the results from the previous code attempt.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core concept of operating on connected components of non-7 cells. However, the specific rules for transforming the values within these components were inaccurate, leading to the failure on `train_1`. The key observations are:\n\n1.  The number 7 acts as a static background/boundary.\n2.  The transformation depends on the properties of the connected component a cell belongs to: primarily its `size` and the `unique values` it contains.\n3.  Special rules apply for components of certain sizes consisting solely of the value 6.\n4.  A \"general rule\" applies to components with mixed values or sizes not covered by the special rules. This general rule appears more complex than initially thought, especially when more than two unique non-7 values are present.\n5.  The failure on `train_1` was due to incorrectly applying the general rule. The component in `train_1` has three unique values (3, 4, 6), which seems to trigger a different behavior than the component in `train_2` with only two unique values (1, 6).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Re-analyze the components in both training examples using the provided `code_execution` output to ensure accuracy.\n2.  Formulate specific rules for components based on size *and* content (e.g., \"Size 4, all 6s\").\n3.  Develop distinct \"general\" rules based on the *number* of unique values within the component (e.g., one rule for 2 unique values, another for 3+ unique values).\n4.  The rule for 3+ unique values seems to involve the minimum and second-minimum values and potentially the distance to cells holding these values.\n5.  Update the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect this more nuanced understanding.\n\n**Metrics and Component Analysis (from `code_execution`)**\n\n*   **Train 1:**\n    *   **Component 1:** Size 9, Unique Values [3, 4, 6], Min Value 3, Second Min Value 4.\n        *   Cells: `[((0, 1), 6), ((0, 2), 6), ((0, 3), 3), ((1, 3), 4), ((2, 3), 6), ((3, 2), 6), ((3, 3), 6), ((3, 4), 6), ((4, 3), 6)]`\n        *   Expected Output: `{ (0,1):3, (0,2):3, (0,3):7, (1,3):7, (2,3):4, (3,2):4, (3,3):4, (3,4):4, (4,3):4 }`\n        *   *Rule Applied (Hypothesized):* Rule G3 (General - 3+ Unique Values) - Cells with min (3) or second min (4) become 7. Others become min (3) if closer to an original min cell, otherwise second min (4).\n\n*   **Train 2:**\n    *   **Component 1:** Size 4, Unique Values [6], Min Value 6.\n        *   Cells: `[((0, 3), 6), ((1, 2), 6), ((1, 3), 6), ((2, 2), 6)]`\n        *   Expected Output: `{ (0,3):6, (1,2):6, (1,3):6, (2,2):6 }`\n        *   *Rule Applied (Hypothesized):* Rule S4 (Size 4, All 6s).\n    *   **Component 2:** Size 1, Unique Values [3], Min Value 3.\n        *   Cells: `[((1, 0), 3)]`\n        *   Expected Output: `{ (1,0):7 }`\n        *   *Rule Applied (Hypothesized):* Rule S1 (Size 1, Not 6).\n    *   **Component 3:** Size 5, Unique Values [1, 6], Min Value 1.\n        *   Cells: `[((4, 0), 1), ((4, 1), 6), ((4, 2), 6), ((4, 3), 6), ((5, 2), 6)]`\n        *   Expected Output: `{ (4,0):7, (4,1):1, (4,2):1, (4,3):1, (5,2):1 }`\n        *   *Rule Applied (Hypothesized):* Rule G2 (General - 2 Unique Values).\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
