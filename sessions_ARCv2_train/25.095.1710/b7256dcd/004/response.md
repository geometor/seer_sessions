Okay, let's reassess the transformation based on the provided examples and the results from the previous code attempt.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core concept of operating on connected components of non-7 cells. However, the specific rules for transforming the values within these components were inaccurate, leading to the failure on `train_1`. The key observations are:

1.  The number 7 acts as a static background/boundary.
2.  The transformation depends on the properties of the connected component a cell belongs to: primarily its `size` and the `unique values` it contains.
3.  Special rules apply for components of certain sizes consisting solely of the value 6.
4.  A "general rule" applies to components with mixed values or sizes not covered by the special rules. This general rule appears more complex than initially thought, especially when more than two unique non-7 values are present.
5.  The failure on `train_1` was due to incorrectly applying the general rule. The component in `train_1` has three unique values (3, 4, 6), which seems to trigger a different behavior than the component in `train_2` with only two unique values (1, 6).

**Strategy:**

1.  Re-analyze the components in both training examples using the provided `code_execution` output to ensure accuracy.
2.  Formulate specific rules for components based on size *and* content (e.g., "Size 4, all 6s").
3.  Develop distinct "general" rules based on the *number* of unique values within the component (e.g., one rule for 2 unique values, another for 3+ unique values).
4.  The rule for 3+ unique values seems to involve the minimum and second-minimum values and potentially the distance to cells holding these values.
5.  Update the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect this more nuanced understanding.

**Metrics and Component Analysis (from `code_execution`)**

*   **Train 1:**
    *   **Component 1:** Size 9, Unique Values [3, 4, 6], Min Value 3, Second Min Value 4.
        *   Cells: `[((0, 1), 6), ((0, 2), 6), ((0, 3), 3), ((1, 3), 4), ((2, 3), 6), ((3, 2), 6), ((3, 3), 6), ((3, 4), 6), ((4, 3), 6)]`
        *   Expected Output: `{ (0,1):3, (0,2):3, (0,3):7, (1,3):7, (2,3):4, (3,2):4, (3,3):4, (3,4):4, (4,3):4 }`
        *   *Rule Applied (Hypothesized):* Rule G3 (General - 3+ Unique Values) - Cells with min (3) or second min (4) become 7. Others become min (3) if closer to an original min cell, otherwise second min (4).

*   **Train 2:**
    *   **Component 1:** Size 4, Unique Values [6], Min Value 6.
        *   Cells: `[((0, 3), 6), ((1, 2), 6), ((1, 3), 6), ((2, 2), 6)]`
        *   Expected Output: `{ (0,3):6, (1,2):6, (1,3):6, (2,2):6 }`
        *   *Rule Applied (Hypothesized):* Rule S4 (Size 4, All 6s).
    *   **Component 2:** Size 1, Unique Values [3], Min Value 3.
        *   Cells: `[((1, 0), 3)]`
        *   Expected Output: `{ (1,0):7 }`
        *   *Rule Applied (Hypothesized):* Rule S1 (Size 1, Not 6).
    *   **Component 3:** Size 5, Unique Values [1, 6], Min Value 1.
        *   Cells: `[((4, 0), 1), ((4, 1), 6), ((4, 2), 6), ((4, 3), 6), ((5, 2), 6)]`
        *   Expected Output: `{ (4,0):7, (4,1):1, (4,2):1, (4,3):1, (5,2):1 }`
        *   *Rule Applied (Hypothesized):* Rule G2 (General - 2 Unique Values).

        - min_value: The minimum integer value among the component's cells.
        - second_min_value: The second minimum integer value (if len(unique_values) >= 2).
        - min_value_cells: Set of coordinates (r, c) where the original value was min_value.
        - second_min_value_cells: Set of coordinates (r, c) where the original value was second_min_value.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Cells are adjacent if they share an edge.
  - Membership: An 'active' cell belongs to exactly one Connected Component.

Transformation:
  description: Modifies the values of 'active' cells based on the properties and rules associated with their Connected Component. Background cells (value 7) remain unchanged.
  rules:
    - Rule S1 (Size 1): Applied if component size is 1.
    - Rule S2 (Size 2, All 6s): Applied if component size is 2 and unique_values is [6].
    - Rule S3 (Size 3, All 6s): Applied if component size is 3 and unique_values is [6].
    - Rule S4 (Size 4, All 6s): Applied if component size is 4 and unique_values is [6].
    - Rule S5 (Size 5, All 6s): Applied if component size is 5 and unique_values is [6].
    - Rule G2 (General - 2 Unique Values): Applied if none of S1-S5 match and len(unique_values) is 2.

Actions:
  - Find Components: Identify all connected components of non-7 cells.
  - Calculate Properties: For each component, determine size, unique_values, min_value, second_min_value, and identify cells holding min/second_min values.
  - Calculate Distances (for Rule G3): For cells not holding min/second_min, find the shortest distance within the component to a min_value_cell and a second_min_value_cell.
  - Apply Rule: Select the appropriate rule (S1-S5, G2, G3) based on component properties.
  - Update Grid: Modify the output grid according to the logic of the selected rule for all cells in the component.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Create a `visited` grid of the same dimensions, initialized to `False`.
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the `input_grid`:
    a.  If the cell `(r, c)` contains a value other than 7 AND has not been `visited`:
        i.  Perform a search (e.g., BFS) starting from `(r, c)` to find all connected cells `(nr, nc)` with values other than 7, marking them as `visited`. Store these as the `component_cells` (including their original coordinates and values).
        ii. Calculate the component's properties:
            *   `size`: The total number of cells in `component_cells`.
            *   `unique_values`: The sorted list of unique original values from `component_cells`.
            *   `min_val`: The first element of `unique_values`.
            *   `min_cells`: The set of coordinates `(nr, nc)` from `component_cells` where the original value was `min_val`.
            *   `second_min_val`: (If `len(unique_values) >= 2`) The second element of `unique_values`.
            *   `second_min_cells`: (If `len(unique_values) >= 2`) The set of coordinates `(nr, nc)` from `component_cells` where the original value was `second_min_val`.
        iii. Determine the transformation rule to apply based on component properties:
            *   **If Rule S1 applies (`size == 1`):**
                *   Set the output value for the single cell to 6 if `unique_values == [6]`, otherwise set it to 7.
            *   **Else if Rule S2 applies (`size == 2` and `unique_values == [6]`):**
                *   Set the output value for both cells to 3.
            *   **Else if Rule S3 applies (`size == 3` and `unique_values == [6]`):**
                *   Set the output value for all cells to 6 (no change needed from copy).
            *   **Else if Rule S4 applies (`size == 4` and `unique_values == [6]`):**
                *   Set the output value for all cells to 6 (no change needed from copy).
            *   **Else if Rule S5 applies (`size == 5` and `unique_values == [6]`):**
                *   Set the output value for all cells to 4.
            *   **Else if Rule G2 applies (`len(unique_values) == 2`):**
                *   For each cell `((cr, cc), v)` in `component_cells`:
                    *   If `v == min_val`, set `output_grid[cr][cc] = 7`.
                    *   Else, set `output_
