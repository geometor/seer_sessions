"""
Transforms a 2D grid of integers based on connected components of non-7 values.

1. Identifies connected components of cells with values other than 7 using 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right). Cells with value 7 act as boundaries.
2. For each component:
    a. Calculates its size (number of cells).
    b. Finds the set of unique values within the component.
    c. Determines the minimum value within the component.
    d. Applies specific rules to modify the cells within the component in the output grid:
        - If size is 1, the cell's value becomes 7.
        - If size is 4 and all values are 6, the cells remain 6.
        - If size is 5 and all values are 6, the cells become 4.
        - Otherwise:
            - Cells originally holding the minimum value change to 7.
            - All other cells in the component change to the minimum value.
3. Cells with the value 7 remain unchanged throughout the process.
