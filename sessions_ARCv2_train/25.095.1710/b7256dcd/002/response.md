## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial analysis and code correctly identified the core concept of connected components of non-7 values and the dependence of the transformation on component properties (size, values, minimum value). However, the code failed on the first training example (`train_1`) because the conditional logic applied the transformation rules incorrectly. Specifically, it evaluated rules for individual cells within a component *after* determining component properties, allowing later, more general rules (Rules 4 and 5) to overwrite the results of specific component-level rules (Rules 1, 2, 3). The code worked for `train_2` by chance, as the components in that example didn't trigger the faulty interaction between rules.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Rule Application Logic:** Modify the process to first determine the single, definitive rule that applies to the *entire* connected component based on its properties (`size`, `unique_values`).
2.  **Apply Transformation:** Once the component-level rule is determined, iterate through the cells of that component and apply the corresponding transformation logic (e.g., all cells become 4, or min-value cells become 7 and others become min-value).
3.  **Verify:** Mentally re-trace the refined logic on both `train_1` and `train_2` to ensure correctness.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the corrected understanding of the transformation rules and their application order.

## Metrics and Analysis

**Train Example 1:**

*   **Input:**
    
```
    7 6 6 3 7
    7 7 7 4 7
    7 7 7 6 7
    7 7 6 6 6
    7 7 7 6 7
    ```

*   **Expected Output:**
    
```
    7 3 3 7 7
    7 7 7 7 7
    7 7 7 4 7
    7 7 4 4 4
    7 7 7 4 7
    ```

*   **Code Output:**
    
```
    7 3 3 7 7
    7 7 7 3 7
    7 7 7 3 7
    7 7 3 3 3
    7 7 7 3 7
    ```

*   **Analysis:**
    *   Component 1: `{(0,1), (0,2), (0,3)}`, values `{6, 6, 3}`, size 3, min 3. Expected: `(0,1)->3`, `(0,2)->3`, `(0,3)->7`. Code Output: Correct. Rule: General Case (min becomes 7, others become min).
    *   Component 2: `{(1,3)}`, values `{4}`, size 1, min 4. Expected: `(1,3)->7`. Code Output: `(1,3)->3`. **Error:** Code failed to apply Rule 1 (Size 1 -> 7) correctly, likely overwriting it.
    *   Component 3: `{(2,3), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,3)}`, values `{6, 6, 6, 6, 6}`, size 5, min 6. Expected: All cells -> 4. Code Output: All cells -> 3. **Error:** Code failed to apply Rule 3 (Size 5, only 6s -> 4) correctly, likely overwriting it.

**Train Example 2:**

*   **Input:**
    
```
    7 7 7 6
    3 7 6 6
    7 7 6 7
    7 7 7 7
    1 6 6 6
    7 7 6 7
    ```

*   **Expected Output:**
    
```
    7 7 7 6
    7 7 6 6
    7 7 6 7
    7 7 7 7
    7 1 1 1
    7 7 1 7
    ```

*   **Code Output:**
    
```
    7 7 7 6
    7 7 6 6
    7 7 6 7
    7 7 7 7
    7 1 1 1
    7 7 1 7
    ```

*   **Analysis:**
    *   Component 1: `{(1,0)}`, values `{3}`, size 1, min 3. Expected: `(1,0)->7`. Code Output: Correct. Rule: Size 1.
    *   Component 2: `{(0,3), (1,2), (1,3), (2,2)}`, values `{6, 6, 6, 6}`, size 4, min 6. Expected: All cells -> 6. Code Output: Correct. Rule: Size 4, only 6s.
    *   Component 3: `{(4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,2)}`, values `{1, 6, 6, 6, 6}`, size 5, min 1. Expected: `(4,0)->7`, others->1. Code Output: Correct. Rule: General Case (min becomes 7, others become min).

**Conclusion from Metrics:** The code's rule application logic was flawed, incorrectly handling the specific cases (Size 1, Size 4/6s, Size 5/6s) when they occurred in `train_1`. The refined strategy addresses this by deciding the component's fate based on a single applicable rule before modifying any cells.

  rules:
    - Rule_Size1:
        condition: component.size == 1
        action: All cells in the component change to 7.
    - Rule_Size4_Only6:
        condition: component.size == 4 AND component.unique_values == {6}
        action: All cells in the component remain 6.
    - Rule_Size5_Only6:
        condition: component.size == 5 AND component.unique_values == {6}
        action: All cells in the component change to 4.
    - Rule_General:
        condition: None of the above rules apply.
        action:
          - For each cell in the component:
            - If cell.value == component.min_value (in the input grid), change the cell to 7 in the output grid.
            - If cell.value != component.min_value (in the input grid), change the cell to component.min_value in the output grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Create a `visited` grid of the same dimensions, initialized to `False`, to track processed cells.
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the `input_grid`.
4.  If the cell `(r, c)` contains a value other than 7 AND has not been `visited`:
    a.  Perform a search (e.g., Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) starting from `(r, c)` to find all connected cells with values other than 7, using 4-way adjacency. Mark each found cell as `visited`.
    b.  Store the coordinates of all cells found in this `component_cells` list.
    c.  Determine the `size` of the component (length of `component_cells`).
    d.  Collect the original values (from `input_grid`) of all cells in the component to find the `unique_values` set and the `min_value`.
    e.  **Determine the transformation rule for the entire component:**
        i.  If `size` is 1, the rule is `Rule_Size1`.
        ii. Else if `size` is 4 AND `unique_values` is exactly `{6}`, the rule is `Rule_Size4_Only6`.
        iii. Else if `size` is 5 AND `unique_values` is exactly `{6}`, the rule is `Rule_Size5_Only6`.
        iv. Otherwise, the rule is `Rule_General`.
    f.  **Apply the determined rule to all cells in the component:**
        i.  If the rule is `Rule_Size1`: For each cell `(cr, cc)` in `component_cells`, set `output_grid[cr][cc] = 7`.
        ii. If the rule is `Rule_Size4_Only6`: For each cell `(cr, cc)` in `component_cells`, set `output_grid[cr][cc] = 6` (no change needed from copy).
        iii. If the rule is `Rule_Size5_Only6`: For each cell `(cr, cc)` in `component_cells`, set `output_grid[cr][cc] = 4`.
        iv. If the rule is `Rule_General`: For each cell `(cr, cc)` in `component_cells`:
            1.  Get the `original_value = input_grid[cr][cc]`.
            2.  If `original_value == min_value`, set `output_grid[cr][cc] = 7`.
            3.  Else (`original_value != min_value`), set `output_grid[cr][cc] = min_value`.
5.  After iterating through all cells in the `input_grid`, return the `output_grid`.
