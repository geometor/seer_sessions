            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial analysis and code correctly identified the core concept of connected components of non-7 values and the dependence of the transformation on component properties (size, values, minimum value). However, the code failed on the first training example (`train_1`) because the conditional logic applied the transformation rules incorrectly. Specifically, it evaluated rules for individual cells within a component *after* determining component properties, allowing later, more general rules (Rules 4 and 5) to overwrite the results of specific component-level rules (Rules 1, 2, 3). The code worked for `train_2` by chance, as the components in that example didn't trigger the faulty interaction between rules.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Rule Application Logic:** Modify the process to first determine the single, definitive rule that applies to the *entire* connected component based on its properties (`size`, `unique_values`).\n2.  **Apply Transformation:** Once the component-level rule is determined, iterate through the cells of that component and apply the corresponding transformation logic (e.g., all cells become 4, or min-value cells become 7 and others become min-value).\n3.  **Verify:** Mentally re-trace the refined logic on both `train_1` and `train_2` to ensure correctness.\n4.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the corrected understanding of the transformation rules and their application order.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\n**Train Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    "

The refined strategy addresses this by deciding the component's fate based on a single applicable rule before modifying any cells.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
