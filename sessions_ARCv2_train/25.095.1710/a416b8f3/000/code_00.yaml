Task: ConcatenateRows
Objects:
  - InputGrid:
      Type: 2D array of integers
      Properties:
        - Rows: variable number
        - Columns: variable number
        - Cells: contain single digits (0-9)
  - OutputGrid:
      Type: 2D array of integers
      Properties:
        - Rows: same as InputGrid
        - Columns: double the columns of InputGrid
        - Cells: contain single digits (0-9)
  - Row:
      Type: 1D array of integers
      Properties:
        - Elements: sequence of integers from a grid row
Relationships:
  - Each OutputGrid Row corresponds to exactly one InputGrid Row at the same row index.
Action:
  - Name: Concatenate Row with Itself
  - Input: A single Row from the InputGrid
  - Output: A new Row formed by appending the Input Row to itself.
Transformation:
  - For each Row in the InputGrid:
      - Perform the "Concatenate Row with Itself" action.
      - Place the resulting concatenated Row into the corresponding row index of the OutputGrid.
