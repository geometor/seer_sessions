        * If R=3 and C>3, the blocks are arranged horizontally.
        * If C=3 and R>3, the blocks are arranged vertically.
    3. Initialize an empty list to store the extracted 3x3 blocks and their properties.

        * If vertical, iterate through the rows in steps of 3. For each step k, extract the 3x3 subgrid corresponding to rows 3k to 3k+2.
    5. For each extracted block, calculate the count of its non-zero elements.
    6. Identify the block that has the highest non-zero count.
