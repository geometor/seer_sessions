They seem to tile the input grid without overlap in their core 3x3 space.\n    *   The output is always a single 3x3 grid.\n    *   The output grid is identical to one of the 3x3 blocks present in the input grid.\n    *   The core task is to identify all the 3x3 blocks within the input and then apply a selection criterion to choose exactly one of them as the output.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
