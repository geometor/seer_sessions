Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** The task takes a square grid of numbers (integers) as input and produces a larger square grid of numbers as output.
2.  **Size Transformation:** The output grid's dimensions (height and width) are exactly twice those of the input grid. If the input is N x N, the output is 2N x 2N.
3.  **Structure:** The output grid appears to be composed of four distinct blocks, each the same size as the original input grid (N x N).
4.  **Quadrant Content:**
    *   The top-left quadrant of the output is identical to the input grid.
    *   The other three quadrants seem to be transformed versions (potentially involving flips and/or transpositions) of the input grid or its transpose.
5.  **Transformations:** The core operations involved seem to be:
    *   Transposition (swapping rows and columns).
    *   Horizontal flipping (reversing the order of columns).
    *   Vertical flipping (reversing the order of rows).
6.  **Assembly:** The final output is constructed by placing these original and transformed N x N grids into the four quadrants of the 2N x 2N output grid according to a specific pattern.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: Grid
  properties:
    - shape: NxN (square)
    - elements: integers
Output:
  type: Grid
  properties:
    - shape: 2Nx2N (square)
    - elements: integers
Derived Objects:
  - Input_Transposed:
      type: Grid
      relation: Transposition of the Input grid (rows become columns, columns become rows).
      properties:
        - shape: NxN
  - Quadrants:
      count: 4
      names: [Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), Bottom-Right (BR)]
      properties:
        - shape: NxN (each)
        - relation: Together compose the Output grid.
Actions:
  - Transpose: Creates Input_Transposed from Input.
  - Flip_Horizontal (FH): Reverses the column order of a grid.
  - Flip_Vertical (FV): Reverses the row order of a grid.
  - Assemble: Places NxN grids into the four quadrants of the 2Nx2N Output grid.
Relationships:
  - Output grid dimensions are 2x the Input grid dimensions.
  - Output TL quadrant = Input grid.
  - Output TR quadrant = FH(Input_Transposed).
  - Output BL quadrant = FV(Input_Transposed).
  - Output BR quadrant = FH(FV(Input)). # Note: Flip Vertical first, then Horizontal
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input N x N grid, let's call it `I`.
2.  Determine the dimension `N` of the input grid `I`.
3.  Create a new output grid, `O`, with dimensions 2N x 2N.
4.  Calculate the transpose of the input grid `I`, let's call it `I_T`.
5.  Calculate the horizontal flip of `I_T`, let's call it `TR_Block = FH(I_T)`.
6.  Calculate the vertical flip of `I_T`, let's call it `BL_Block = FV(I_T)`.
7.  Calculate the vertical flip of the original input grid `I`, let's call it `Temp = FV(I)`.
8.  Calculate the horizontal flip of `Temp`, let's call it `BR_Block = FH(Temp) = FH(FV(I))`.
9.  Place the original input grid `I` into the top-left quadrant (rows 0 to N-1, columns 0 to N-1) of the output grid `O`.
10. Place the `TR_Block` (FH(I_T)) into the top-right quadrant (rows 0 to N-1, columns N to 2N-1) of `O`.
11. Place the `BL_Block` (FV(I_T)) into the bottom-left quadrant (rows N to 2N-1, columns 0 to N-1) of `O`.
12. Place the `BR_Block` (FH(FV(I))) into the bottom-right quadrant (rows N to 2N-1, columns N to 2N-1) of `O`.
13. Return the assembled 2N x 2N output grid `O`.
