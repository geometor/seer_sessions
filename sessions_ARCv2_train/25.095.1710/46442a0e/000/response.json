If the input is N x N, the output is 2N x 2N.\n3.  **Structure:** The output grid appears to be composed of four distinct blocks, each the same size as the original input grid (N x N).\n4.  **Quadrant Content:**\n    *   The top-left quadrant of the output is identical to the input grid.\n    *   The other three quadrants seem to be transformed versions (potentially involving flips and/or transpositions) of the input grid or its transpose.\n5.  **Transformations:** The core operations involved seem to be:\n    *   Transposition (swapping rows and columns).\n    *   Horizontal flipping (reversing the order of columns).\n    *   Vertical flipping (reversing the order of rows).\n6.  **Assembly:** The final output is constructed by placing these original and transformed N x N grids into the four quadrants of the 2N x 2N output grid according to a specific pattern.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
