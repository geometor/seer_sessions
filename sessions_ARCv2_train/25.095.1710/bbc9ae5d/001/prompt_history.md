## Perception of Elements

The task involves transforming a single input sequence of integers into multiple output sequences.
-   **Input:** A single line containing space-separated integers. The sequence typically starts with one or more occurrences of a non-zero digit, followed by zero or more zeros.
-   **Output:** Multiple lines, each containing a space-separated sequence of integers.
    -   The first line of the output is always identical to the input sequence.
    -   Each subsequent line is derived from the previous line by changing the leftmost remaining zero (that originally followed the initial non-zero digits) into the initial non-zero digit.
-   **Transformation:** The core transformation is the progressive replacement of zeros. The key is determining how many zeros are replaced.
-   **Pattern:** Let the input sequence have length `L`, the initial non-zero digit be `d`, and the count of initial `d`'s be `N`. The number of zeros available for replacement is `L - N`. The process generates `k` new lines after the first (input) line, meaning `k` zeros are replaced. The value of `k` seems related to `L` and `N`. Through analysis, `k` appears to be calculated as `min(L - N, floor(L / 2.5))`, which can be computed using integer division as `min(L - N, L * 2 // 5)`.
