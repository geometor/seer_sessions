```python
"""
Transforms a single input sequence of integers into multiple output sequences.
The input sequence typically starts with one or more occurrences of a non-zero digit 'd',
followed by zero or more zeros.
The first output sequence is identical to the input sequence.
Each subsequent output sequence is generated by taking the previous sequence and changing
the leftmost remaining zero (that originally followed the initial 'd's) into the digit 'd'.
The number of sequences generated after the initial one (i.e., the number of zeros replaced)
is determined by 'k', calculated as the minimum of the number of available zeros after
the initial 'd's and the integer division result of (length of sequence * 2 / 5).
Specifically, if L is the length of the sequence and N is the count of initial 'd's,
k = min(L - N, L * 2 // 5).
The total number of output sequences will be k + 1.
