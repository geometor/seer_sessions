Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

## Perception of Elements

The task takes a 3x3 grid of single digits as input and produces a 3x12 grid of single digits as output. Each row in the output grid seems to be derived from the corresponding row in the input grid. The transformation involves reversing, concatenating, and duplicating sequences of digits within each row.

## Facts


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    properties:
      rows: 3
      columns: 3
      cell_type: digit
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    properties:
      rows: 3
      columns: 12
      cell_type: digit
  - type: grid
    name: intermediate_grid
    properties:
      rows: 3
      columns: 6
      cell_type: digit
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    steps:
      - step: 1
        action: process_rows
        input: input_grid
        output: intermediate_grid
        details: For each row in the input_grid, create a corresponding row in the intermediate_grid by concatenating the reversed sequence of digits from the input row with the original sequence of digits from the input row.
      - step: 2
        action: duplicate_horizontally
        input: intermediate_grid
        output: output_grid
        details: Create the output_grid by horizontally concatenating the intermediate_grid with itself.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  For each row in the 3x3 input grid:
    a.  Let the sequence of the three digits in the current input row be `R`.
    b.  Reverse the sequence `R` to create a new sequence `R_reversed`.
    c.  Concatenate `R_reversed` and `R` to form a new sequence of six digits, `M_row`. This `M_row` corresponds to a row in an intermediate 3x6 grid.
2.  Construct the intermediate 3x6 grid using the `M_row` sequences generated for each input row.
3.  Construct the final 3x12 output grid by horizontally concatenating the entire intermediate 3x6 grid with itself.
