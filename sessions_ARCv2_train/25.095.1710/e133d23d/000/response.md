Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Data Structure:** The input consists of grids with 3 rows and 7 columns. The grids contain integer values: 0, 4, 6, and 8.
2.  **Output Data Structure:** The output consists of grids with 3 rows and 3 columns. The grids contain integer values: 0 and 2.
3.  **Separator Column:** The 4th column (index 3) in the input grid consistently contains the value 4. This column seems to act as a separator and does not directly map to the output.
4.  **Input Subgrids:** The input grid can be conceptually divided into two 3x3 subgrids by ignoring the central column of 4s:
    *   `Left Subgrid`: Columns 0, 1, 2. Contains values 0 and 6.
    *   `Right Subgrid`: Columns 4, 5, 6. Contains values 0 and 8.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The output grid seems to be generated by combining information from the corresponding cells of the `Left Subgrid` and `Right Subgrid`.
6.  **Mapping Rule:** Observing the examples, it appears that a cell in the output grid is set to 2 if *either* the corresponding cell in the `Left Subgrid` or the `Right Subgrid` (or both) contains a non-zero value (6 or 8). If both corresponding input cells are 0, the output cell is 0. The specific non-zero value (6 or 8) doesn't influence the output value, only its presence.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: InputGrid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - dimensions: 3 rows x 7 columns
      - cell_values: [0, 4, 6, 8]
      - structure: Contains a central separator column (index 3) always filled with 4.
  - object: OutputGrid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - dimensions: 3 rows x 3 columns
      - cell_values: [0, 2]
  - object: LeftSubgrid
    properties:
      - derivation: Extracted from InputGrid columns 0, 1, 2.
      - dimensions: 3 rows x 3 columns
      - cell_values: [0, 6] (based on examples)
  - object: RightSubgrid
    properties:
      - derivation: Extracted from InputGrid columns 4, 5, 6.
      - dimensions: 3 rows x 3 columns
      - cell_values: [0, 8] (based on examples)
  - relationship: InputToOutputMapping
    description: Each cell in the OutputGrid is determined by the corresponding cells in the LeftSubgrid and RightSubgrid.
    rule: |
      For each cell position (row, column) from (0,0) to (2,2):
      OutputGrid[row, column] = 2 if (LeftSubgrid[row, column] != 0) OR (RightSubgrid[row, column] != 0).
      OutputGrid[row, column] = 0 if (LeftSubgrid[row, column] == 0) AND (RightSubgrid[row, column] == 0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty 3x3 grid for the output.
2.  Iterate through each row `r` from 0 to 2.
3.  Inside the row loop, iterate through each column `c` from 0 to 2.
4.  For the current cell `(r, c)`:
    a.  Get the value from the input grid at `(r, c)` (this is the value from the `Left Subgrid`). Let's call it `left_value`.
    b.  Get the value from the input grid at `(r, c + 4)` (this is the value from the `Right Subgrid`). Let's call it `right_value`.
    c.  Check if `left_value` is non-zero OR `right_value` is non-zero.
    d.  If the condition in step 4c is true, set the output grid cell at `(r, c)` to 2.
    e.  Otherwise (if both `left_value` and `right_value` are zero), set the output grid cell at `(r, c)` to 0.
5.  Return the completed 3x3 output grid.
