    description: Each cell in the OutputGrid is determined by the corresponding cells in the LeftSubgrid and RightSubgrid.
    rule: |
      For each cell position (row, column) from (0,0) to (2,2):
      OutputGrid[row, column] = 2 if (LeftSubgrid[row, column] != 0) OR (RightSubgrid[row, column] != 0).
      OutputGrid[row, column] = 0 if (LeftSubgrid[row, column] == 0) AND (RightSubgrid[row, column] == 0).
