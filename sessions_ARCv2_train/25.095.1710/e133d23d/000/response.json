The grids contain integer values: 0, 4, 6, and 8.\n2.  **Output Data Structure:** The output consists of grids with 3 rows and 3 columns. The grids contain integer values: 0 and 2.\n3.  **Separator Column:** The 4th column (index 3) in the input grid consistently contains the value 4. This column seems to act as a separator and does not directly map to the output.\n4.  **Input Subgrids:** The input grid can be conceptually divided into two 3x3 subgrids by ignoring the central column of 4s:\n    *   `Left Subgrid`: Columns 0, 1, 2. Contains values 0 and 6.\n    *   `Right Subgrid`: Columns 4, 5, 6. Contains values 0 and 8.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The output grid seems to be generated by combining information from the corresponding cells of the `Left Subgrid` and `Right Subgrid`.\n6.  **Mapping Rule:** Observing the examples, it appears that a cell in the output grid is set to 2 if *either* the corresponding cell in the `Left Subgrid` or the `Right Subgrid` (or both) contains a non-zero value (6 or 8). If both corresponding input cells are 0, the output cell is 0. The specific non-zero value (6 or 8) doesn't influence the output value, only its presence.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
