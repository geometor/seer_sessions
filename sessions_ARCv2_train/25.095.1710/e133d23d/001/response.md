"""
Transforms a 3x7 input grid into a 3x3 output grid based on non-zero values 
in corresponding positions of two conceptual 3x3 subgrids within the input.

The input grid is conceptually divided by ignoring the 4th column (index 3).
The first three columns form the 'left subgrid'.
The last three columns (indices 4, 5, 6) form the 'right subgrid'.

For each cell position (row, col) in the 3x3 output grid:
- If the value at (row, col) in the left subgrid OR the value at (row, col) 
  in the right subgrid is non-zero, the output cell at (row, col) is set to 2.
- If both corresponding input cells are zero, the output cell is set to 0.
