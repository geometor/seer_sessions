objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - structure: composed of a smaller subsequence repeated three times
  - name: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - structure: identical to the repeating subsequence found in the input
relationships:
  - type: derivation
    origin: input_sequence
    target: output_sequence
    action:
      - identify the length of the input sequence (L)
      - calculate the length of the repeating subsequence (L/3)
      - extract the first L/3 elements from the input_sequence to form the output_sequence
