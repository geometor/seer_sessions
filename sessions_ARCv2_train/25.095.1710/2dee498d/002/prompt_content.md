Receive the input sequence of numbers for each line.
Determine the total length of the input sequence for that line.
Calculate one-third of the total length. Let this be the subsequence_length.
Extract the first subsequence_length numbers from the input sequence for that line.
Return the extracted subsequence as the output for that line.
Repeat for all input lines.
