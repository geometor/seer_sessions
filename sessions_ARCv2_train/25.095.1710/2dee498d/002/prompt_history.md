Okay, analyzing the provided examples:

**Perception:**

*   Each input is a sequence of space-separated integers.
*   Each output is also a sequence of space-separated integers.
*   Comparing inputs and outputs, the output appears to be a prefix (the beginning part) of the input sequence.
*   In every example, the input sequence seems to be formed by repeating a smaller subsequence exactly three times.
*   The output sequence corresponds precisely to this smaller, repeating subsequence.
*   The length of the output sequence is always one-third of the length of the input sequence.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - structure: composed of a smaller subsequence repeated three times
  - name: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - structure: identical to the repeating subsequence found in the input
relationships:
  - type: derivation
    origin: input_sequence
    target: output_sequence
    action:
      - identify the length of the input sequence (L)
      - calculate the length of the repeating subsequence (L/3)
      - extract the first L/3 elements from the input_sequence to form the output_sequence
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of numbers.
2.  Determine the total length of the input sequence.
3.  Calculate one-third of the total length. Let this be the `subsequence_length`.
4.  Extract the first `subsequence_length` numbers from the input sequence.
5.  Return the extracted subsequence as the output.
```python
import math

"""
Receive the input sequence of numbers for each line.
