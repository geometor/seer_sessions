objects:
  - name: input_task
    properties:
      - type: list of examples
      - structure: each example contains an input sequence and an output sequence
  - name: input_sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: L (a multiple of 3)
  - name: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: L/3
relationships:
  - type: derivation
    origin: input_sequence
    target: output_sequence
    action:
      - determine the length of the input_sequence (L)
      - calculate the target length (N = L / 3) using integer division
      - extract the first N elements from the input_sequence
      - the extracted subsequence is the output_sequence
