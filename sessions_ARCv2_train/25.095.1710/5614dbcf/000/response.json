            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input is consistently a 9x9 grid composed of single digits (0-9).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output is consistently a 3x3 grid composed of single digits (0-9).\n3.  **Grid Partitioning:** The input 9x9 grid can be naturally divided into nine 3x3 subgrids. There's a clear spatial correspondence between these 3x3 input subgrids and the cells of the 3x3 output grid. The top-left 3x3 subgrid maps to the top-left output cell, the top-middle 3x3 subgrid maps to the top-middle output cell, and so on.\n4.  **Transformation Logic:** The value of each output cell is determined by analyzing the contents of its corresponding 3x3 input subgrid.\n5.  **Dominant Digit:** Within each 3x3 subgrid, the most frequently occurring non-zero digit seems important.\n6.  **Special Case Digit ('5'):** The digit '5' appears to play a special role. If a '5' is present in a 3x3 subgrid, the corresponding output cell often becomes '0'. However, this is overridden if another non-zero digit appears more frequently than '5' within that same subgrid.\n7.  **Zero Handling:** If a subgrid contains only zeros, or only zeros and fives where five is not the most frequent non-zero digit, the output is '0'.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
