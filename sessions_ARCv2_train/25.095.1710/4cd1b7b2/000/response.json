            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are represented as 4x4 grids (or matrices) containing single-digit integers.\n2.  **Number Range:** The integers within the grids range from 0 to 4.\n3.  **Role of Zero:** The number 0 in the input grid appears to act as a placeholder or an empty cell that needs to be filled. Zeros are absent in the output grids.\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The core transformation involves replacing the zeros in the input grid with non-zero digits (specifically 1, 2, 3, or 4).\n5.  **Output Structure Constraint:** Observing the output grids reveals a specific structure: each row contains all the numbers from 1 to 4 exactly once, and similarly, each column also contains all the numbers from 1 to 4 exactly once. This is the definition of a Latin Square of order 4 using the symbols {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n6.  **Implied Logic:** The task is to complete the partial input grid (where 0s represent missing entries) into a full 4x4 Latin Square using the numbers {1, 2, 3, 4}. The non-zero numbers present in the input grid act as fixed constraints for the completion.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Construct the resulting 4x4 output grid by replacing the original 0s with the determined numbers while keeping the original non-zero numbers unchanged.\n6.  Return the completed 4x4 grid."
