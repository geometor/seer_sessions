task_description: Complete a partially filled 4x4 grid to form a Latin Square.
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array (4x4) of integers
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4 rows, 4 columns
      - cell_values: integers from 0 to 4
  - name: cell
    type: element within the grid
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-4)
      - row_index: integer (0-3)
      - column_index: integer (0-3)
  - name: number_set
    value: {1, 2, 3, 4}
    description: The set of target numbers for rows and columns in the output.
special_values:
  - value: 0
    role: Represents an empty or unfilled cell in the input grid.
relationships:
  - type: constraint
    applies_to: output grid
    details: Each row must contain exactly one instance of each number in the number_set {1, 2, 3, 4}.
  - type: constraint
    applies_to: output grid
    details: Each column must contain exactly one instance of each number in the number_set {1, 2, 3, 4}.
  - type: transformation
    input: input grid
    output: output grid
    action: Replace cells with value 0 in the input grid with numbers from the number_set {1, 2, 3, 4} such that the output grid satisfies the row and column constraints (Latin Square property).
