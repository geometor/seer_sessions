Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are represented as 4x4 grids (or matrices) containing single-digit integers.
2.  **Number Range:** The integers within the grids range from 0 to 4.
3.  **Role of Zero:** The number 0 in the input grid appears to act as a placeholder or an empty cell that needs to be filled. Zeros are absent in the output grids.
4.  **Transformation Goal:** The core transformation involves replacing the zeros in the input grid with non-zero digits (specifically 1, 2, 3, or 4).
5.  **Output Structure Constraint:** Observing the output grids reveals a specific structure: each row contains all the numbers from 1 to 4 exactly once, and similarly, each column also contains all the numbers from 1 to 4 exactly once. This is the definition of a Latin Square of order 4 using the symbols {1, 2, 3, 4}.
6.  **Implied Logic:** The task is to complete the partial input grid (where 0s represent missing entries) into a full 4x4 Latin Square using the numbers {1, 2, 3, 4}. The non-zero numbers present in the input grid act as fixed constraints for the completion.

**YAML Facts:**

    action: Replace cells with value 0 in the input grid with numbers from the number_set {1, 2, 3, 4} such that the output grid satisfies the row and column constraints (Latin Square property).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept a 4x4 input grid containing integers from 0 to 4.
2.  Identify the locations (row and column indices) of all cells containing the value 0. These are the cells that need to be filled.
3.  Determine the appropriate number (from the set {1, 2, 3, 4}) to place in each empty cell.
4.  The placement must ensure that the final 4x4 grid satisfies two conditions:
    *   Every row contains each number from 1 to 4 exactly once.
    *   Every column contains each number from 1 to 4 exactly once.
5.  Construct the resulting 4x4 output grid by replacing the original 0s with the determined numbers while keeping the original non-zero numbers unchanged.
6.  Return the completed 4x4 grid.
