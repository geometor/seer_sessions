*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input consists of four integers arranged conceptually in a 2x2 grid format, provided as two lines of two space-separated integers.
    *   The output is a larger grid of integers, specifically 6 rows by 6 columns.
    *   The numbers in the output grid are precisely the numbers provided in the input.
    *   The output grid exhibits a clear repeating pattern based on the input numbers.

      - The content of the output grid is solely determined by the four input integers and their arrangement.
      - There are two distinct 2x2 patterns used to tile the output grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Read the input, interpreting the first line as integers `a` and `b`, and the second line as integers `c` and `d`.
    2.  Define the primary 2x2 pattern `P1` as the arrangement:
        
```
        a b
        c d
        ```

    3.  Define the secondary 2x2 pattern `P2` by swapping the columns of `P1`:
        
```
        b a
        d c
        ```

    4.  Create the 6x6 output grid by arranging these patterns as follows:
        *   Rows 0 and 1: Repeat `P1` three times horizontally (`P1 P1 P1`).
        *   Rows 2 and 3: Repeat `P2` three times horizontally (`P2 P2 P2`).
        *   Rows 4 and 5: Repeat `P1` three times horizontally (`P1 P1 P1`).
    5.  Print the resulting 6x6 grid, ensuring numbers in each row are space-separated.

## Example 2:
Error: Execution Error: 'list' object has no attribute 'split'
*   **General Assessment:**
    The previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: creating a 6x6 grid by tiling two 2x2 patterns derived from the 2x2 input. Pattern 1 (P1) is the input itself, and Pattern 2 (P2) is P1 with columns swapped. The tiling scheme (P1 P1 P1 / P2 P2 P2 / P1 P1 P1) is also correct.

    The error (`'list' object has no attribute 'split'`) indicates a mismatch between how the `transform` function expected to receive the input (as a list of two strings, e.g., `["7 9", "4 3"]`) and how the input was actually provided during execution (likely pre-parsed into a list of lists, e.g., `[[7, 9], [4, 3]]`).

    The strategy is to adjust the input handling part of the function to accept the pre-parsed grid format (List[List[int]]) while keeping the pattern generation and tiling logic unchanged.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Example 1:**
        *   Input: 2x2 grid (`[[7, 9], [4, 3]]`)
        *   Output: 6x6 grid
        *   Code Result: Execution Error (`'list' object has no attribute 'split'`)
        *   Reason: Input parsing assumed string format (`["7 9", "4 3"]`) but received list format (`[[7, 9], [4, 3]]`).
        *   Pattern P1: `[[7, 9], [4, 3]]`
        *   Pattern P2: `[[9, 7], [3, 4]]`
        *   Expected Output Rows based on logic:
            *   Row 0: `[7, 9] * 3 = [7, 9, 7, 9, 7, 9]` (Matches expected output)
            *   Row 1: `[4, 3] * 3 = [4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3]` (Matches expected output)
            *   Row 2: `[9, 7] * 3 = [9, 7, 9, 7, 9, 7]` (Matches expected output)
            *   Row 3: `[3, 4] * 3 = [3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4]` (Matches expected output)
            *   Row 4: `[7, 9] * 3 = [7, 9, 7, 9, 7, 9]` (Matches expected output)
            *   Row 5: `[4, 3] * 3 = [4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3]` (Matches expected output)
    *   **Example 2:**
        *   Input: 2x2 grid (`[[8, 6], [6, 4]]`)
        *   Output: 6x6 grid
        *   Code Result: Execution Error (`'list' object has no attribute 'split'`)
        *   Reason: Input parsing assumed string format (`["8 6", "6 4"]`) but received list format (`[[8, 6], [6, 4]]`).
        *   Pattern P1: `[[8, 6], [6, 4]]`
        *   Pattern P2: `[[6, 8], [4, 6]]`
        *   Expected Output Rows based on logic:
            *   Row 0: `[8, 6] * 3 = [8, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6]` (Matches expected output)
            *   Row 1: `[6, 4] * 3 = [6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4]` (Matches expected output)
            *   Row 2: `[6, 8] * 3 = [6, 8, 6, 8, 6, 8]` (Matches expected output)
