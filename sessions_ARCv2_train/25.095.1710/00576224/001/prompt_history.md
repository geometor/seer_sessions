*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input consists of four integers arranged conceptually in a 2x2 grid format, provided as two lines of two space-separated integers.
    *   The output is a larger grid of integers, specifically 6 rows by 6 columns.
    *   The numbers in the output grid are precisely the numbers provided in the input.
    *   The output grid exhibits a clear repeating pattern based on the input numbers.

*   **YAML Fact Document:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Generate a 6x6 grid based on a 2x2 input grid pattern.
    input_structure:
      type: grid
      dimensions: 2x2
      format: Two lines, each with two space-separated integers.
      elements:
        - name: a (top-left)
        - name: b (top-right)
        - name: c (bottom-left)
        - name: d (bottom-right)
    output_structure:
      type: grid
      dimensions: 6x6
      format: Six lines, each with six space-separated integers.
    transformation:
      actions:
        - define_block_1: Create a 2x2 block (B1) using the input numbers [a, b], [c, d].
        - define_block_2: Create a second 2x2 block (B2) by swapping the columns of B1: [b, a], [d, c].
        - construct_output_grid: Assemble the 6x6 output grid by tiling B1 and B2.
      tiling_pattern:
        - row_pair_1 (rows 0, 1): Repeat B1 horizontally three times.
        - row_pair_2 (rows 2, 3): Repeat B2 horizontally three times.
        - row_pair_3 (rows 4, 5): Repeat B1 horizontally three times.
    relationships:
      - The output grid dimensions (6x6) are three times the input grid dimensions (2x2) in both height and width.
      - The content of the output grid is solely determined by the four input integers and their arrangement.
      - There are two distinct 2x2 patterns used to tile the output grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Read the input, interpreting the first line as integers `a` and `b`, and the second line as integers `c` and `d`.
    2.  Define the primary 2x2 pattern `P1` as the arrangement:
        
```
        a b
        c d
        ```

    3.  Define the secondary 2x2 pattern `P2` by swapping the columns of `P1`:
        
```
        b a
        d c
        ```

    4.  Create the 6x6 output grid by arranging these patterns as follows:
        *   Rows 0 and 1: Repeat `P1` three times horizontally (`P1 P1 P1`).
        *   Rows 2 and 3: Repeat `P2` three times horizontally (`P2 P2 P2`).
        *   Rows 4 and 5: Repeat `P1` three times horizontally (`P1 P1 P1`).
    5.  Print the resulting 6x6 grid, ensuring numbers in each row are space-separated.
