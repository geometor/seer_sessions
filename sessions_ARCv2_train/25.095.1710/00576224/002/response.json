            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: creating a 6x6 grid by tiling two 2x2 patterns derived from the 2x2 input. Pattern 1 (P1) is the input itself, and Pattern 2 (P2) is P1 with columns swapped. The tiling scheme (P1 P1 P1 / P2 P2 P2 / P1 P1 P1) is also correct.\n\n    The error (`'list' object has no attribute 'split'`) indicates a mismatch between how the `transform` function expected to receive the input (as a list of two strings, e.g., `[\"7 9\", \"4 3\"]`) and how the input was actually provided during execution (likely pre-parsed into a list of lists, e.g., `[[7, 9], [4, 3]]`).\n\n    The strategy is to adjust the input handling part of the function to accept the pre-parsed grid format (List[List[int]]) while keeping the pattern generation and tiling logic unchanged.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   **Example 1:**\n        *   Input: 2x2 grid (`[[7, 9], [4, 3]]`)\n        *   Output: 6x6 grid\n        *   Code Result: Execution Error (`'list' object has no attribute 'split'`)\n        *   Reason: Input parsing assumed string format (`[\"7 9\", \"4 3\"]`) but received list format (`[[7, 9], [4, 3]]`).\n        *   Pattern P1: `[[7, 9], [4, 3]]`\n        *   Pattern P2: `[[9, 7], [3, 4]]`\n        *   Expected Output Rows based on logic:\n            *   Row 0: `[7, 9] * 3 = [7, 9, 7, 9, 7, 9]` (Matches expected output)\n            *   Row 1: `[4, 3] * 3 = [4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3]` (Matches expected output)\n            *   Row 2: `[9, 7] * 3 = [9, 7, 9, 7, 9, 7]` (Matches expected output)\n            *   Row 3: `[3, 4] * 3 = [3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4]` (Matches expected output)\n            *   Row 4: `[7, 9] * 3 = [7, 9, 7, 9, 7, 9]` (Matches expected output)\n            *   Row 5: `[4, 3] * 3 = [4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3]` (Matches expected output)\n    *   **Example 2:**\n        *   Input: 2x2 grid (`[[8, 6], [6, 4]]`)\n        *   Output: 6x6 grid\n        *   Code Result: Execution Error (`'list' object has no attribute 'split'`)\n        *   Reason: Input parsing assumed string format (`[\"8 6\", \"6 4\"]`) but received list format (`[[8, 6], [6, 4]]`).\n        *   Pattern P1: `[[8, 6], [6, 4]]`\n        *   Pattern P2: `[[6, 8], [4, 6]]`\n        *   Expected Output Rows based on logic:\n            *   Row 0: `[8, 6] * 3 = [8, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6]` (Matches expected output)\n            *   Row 1: `[6, 4] * 3 = [6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4]` (Matches expected output)\n            *   Row 2: `[6, 8] * 3 = [6, 8, 6, 8, 6, 8]` (Matches expected output)\n            *   Row 3: `[4, 6] * 3 = [4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6]` (Matches expected output)\n            *   Row 4: `[8, 6] * 3 = [8, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6]` (Matches expected output)\n            *   Row 5: `[6, 4] * 3 = [6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4]` (Matches expected output)\n\n*   **YAML Fact Document:**\n    "
