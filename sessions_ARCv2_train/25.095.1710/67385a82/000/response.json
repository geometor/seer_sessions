The transformation rule appears to modify the number 3 based on its connectivity to other 3s. Zeros remain unchanged. Specifically, the number 3 seems to change to 8 only if it is part of a group of connected 3s (sharing a side, horizontally or vertically). Isolated 3s (not connected to any other 3s) remain as 3s.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
