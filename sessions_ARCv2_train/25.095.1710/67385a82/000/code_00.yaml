elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers.
    properties:
      - type: input_grid
        values: Contains integers 0 and 3.
      - type: output_grid
        values: Contains integers 0, 3, and 8.
        relation: Derived from the input_grid based on a transformation rule.
      - dimensions: Both input and output grids have the same height and width for a given example pair.
  - object: cell
    description: An individual element within the grid.
    properties:
      - value: An integer (0, 3, or 8).
      - position: Defined by row and column index.
      - neighbours: Cells directly adjacent horizontally or vertically.
  - object: connected_component
    description: A group of cells with the value 3 that are connected.
    properties:
      - connectivity: Cells are connected if they share a horizontal or vertical edge (not diagonal).
      - size: The number of cells in the component.
actions:
  - action: identify_components
    description: Find all connected components of cells containing the value 3 in the input grid.
    input: input_grid
    output: A set of connected components, each component being a set of cell positions.
  - action: transform_components
    description: Modify the values of cells based on the size of their connected component.
    input: input_grid, identified_components
    output: output_grid
    rule:
      - if: A cell belongs to a connected component of 3s with size >= 2.
        then: Change the cell's value from 3 to 8 in the output grid.
      - if: A cell belongs to a connected component of 3s with size == 1 (isolated 3).
        then: Keep the cell's value as 3 in the output grid.
      - if: A cell's value is 0.
        then: Keep the cell's value as 0 in the output grid.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Adjacency between cells (horizontal and vertical neighbors).
  - type: membership
    description: Cells belong to connected components.
  - type: transformation
    description: The value of a cell in the output grid depends on its value and the size of its connected component (if any) in the input grid.
