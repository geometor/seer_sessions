task_description: "Modify cell values in a 2D integer grid based on neighbor values."
grid_elements:
  - type: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0, 1, or 2)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
      - neighbors: adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)
relationships:
  - type: neighborhood
    description: "A cell's value transformation depends on the values of its orthogonal neighbors."
actions:
  - action: check_cell_value
    target: cell
    condition: "value is 2"
  - action: check_neighbors
    target: cell (with value 2)
    condition: "all existing orthogonal neighbors (within grid bounds) have value 0"
  - action: update_cell_value
    target: cell (meeting both conditions above)
    new_value: 1
  - action: copy_cell_value
    target: cell
    condition: "cell does not meet the conditions for update"
    description: "Cell value remains unchanged in the output grid."
constants:
  - target_value: 2 # The value of cells to potentially change
  - neighbor_condition_value: 0 # The required value for all neighbors
  - result_value: 1 # The value to change the target cell to
