Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Data:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) containing integer values.
*   **Values:** The grids contain the integers 0, 1, and 2.
*   **Transformation Type:** The transformation modifies specific cell values within the grid based on local context (neighboring cells). The grid dimensions remain the same.
*   **Key Observation:** The only changes observed are cells with value `2` changing to `1`. No other values seem to change. The positions of the changes vary between examples.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: "Modify cell values in a 2D integer grid based on neighbor values."
grid_elements:
  - type: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0, 1, or 2)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
      - neighbors: adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)
relationships:
  - type: neighborhood
    description: "A cell's value transformation depends on the values of its orthogonal neighbors."
actions:
  - action: check_cell_value
    target: cell
    condition: "value is 2"
  - action: check_neighbors
    target: cell (with value 2)
    condition: "all existing orthogonal neighbors (within grid bounds) have value 0"
  - action: update_cell_value
    target: cell (meeting both conditions above)
    new_value: 1
  - action: copy_cell_value
    target: cell
    condition: "cell does not meet the conditions for update"
    description: "Cell value remains unchanged in the output grid."
constants:
  - target_value: 2 # The value of cells to potentially change
  - neighbor_condition_value: 0 # The required value for all neighbors
  - result_value: 1 # The value to change the target cell to
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid.
3.  Get the value `v` of the current cell `(r, c)`.
4.  **Condition Check:** If the value `v` is equal to `2`:
    a.  Identify all valid orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right) of the cell `(r, c)` that are within the grid boundaries.
    b.  Check if *all* these identified neighbors have a value of `0`.
    c.  **Transformation:** If all valid orthogonal neighbors have a value of `0`, set the value of the corresponding cell `(r, c)` in the output grid to `1`.
    d.  **No Transformation:** If the condition in step 4b is not met (i.e., at least one neighbor exists and is not `0`), copy the original value `v` (which is `2`) to the corresponding cell `(r, c)` in the output grid.
5.  **Else (Value is not 2):** If the value `v` is not equal to `2`, copy the value `v` directly to the corresponding cell `(r, c)` in the output grid.
6.  After iterating through all cells, the output grid contains the final transformed result.
