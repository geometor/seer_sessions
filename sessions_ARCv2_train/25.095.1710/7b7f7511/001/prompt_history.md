## Perception

The input and output data consist of grids or lists of integers, presented as lines of space-separated numbers. The core transformation appears to involve identifying a repetitive pattern within the input data and then extracting the unique, non-repeated portion.

Two types of repetition are observed:

1.  **Vertical Repetition:** The entire block of lines repeats itself. For example, in `train_3`, the first three lines (`2 3`, `3 2`, `4 4`) are identical to the last three lines. The output is the first, unique block of lines.
2.  **Horizontal Repetition:** Within each line, the sequence of numbers repeats itself. For example, in `train_1`, the line `6 4 8 6 4 8` consists of `6 4 8` repeated twice. In `train_2`, `1 1 3 2 1 1 3 2` consists of `1 1 3 2` repeated twice. When this pattern occurs across all lines (and vertical repetition is not present), the output consists of the first half of each line.

The transformation logic prioritizes checking for vertical repetition first. If found, the output is the first half (vertically) of the input lines. If vertical repetition is not found, it then checks for horizontal repetition within each line. If all lines exhibit horizontal repetition, the output is the first half (horizontally) of each input line.

## Facts


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_data
    type: list_of_lines
    properties:
      - each line is a string of space-separated integers
      - number_of_lines (N)
      - number_of_integers_per_line (M - assumed constant for simplicity, though examples show varying M)
  - name: output_data
    type: list_of_lines
    properties:
      - derived from input_data based on repetition patterns
  - name: line
    type: list_of_integers
  - name: block_of_lines
    type: list_of_lines
properties:
  - repetition_type: vertical | horizontal | none
relationships:
  - output_data is a subset of input_data
  - output_data is generated by removing redundancy from input_data
actions:
  - parse: convert input string lines into lists of integers
  - split_vertically: divide the list of lines into two halves (top and bottom) if N is even
  - split_horizontally: divide each line (list of integers) into two halves (left and right) if M is even
  - compare: check if two blocks of lines or two halves of a line are identical
  - select: choose the appropriate half (top block or left half of lines) as the output
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Read the input data, interpreting each line as a list of integers. Let N be the total number of lines and M be the number of integers per line (assume M is consistent for horizontal checks).
2.  **Check for Vertical Repetition:**
    *   If the number of lines (N) is even, divide the input lines into two blocks: the top block (lines 1 to N/2) and the bottom block (lines N/2 + 1 to N).
    *   Compare the top block with the bottom block.
    *   If the two blocks are identical, the output is the top block of lines. Stop processing.
3.  **Check for Horizontal Repetition (if vertical repetition was not found or N is odd):**
    *   Assume the number of integers per line (M) is even.
    *   Initialize a flag `all_lines_repeat_horizontally` to true.
    *   For each line in the input:
        *   Divide the line into two halves: the left half (integers 1 to M/2) and the right half (integers M/2 + 1 to M).
        *   Compare the left half with the right half.
        *   If they are not identical for any line, set `all_lines_repeat_horizontally` to false and break the loop.
    *   If `all_lines_repeat_horizontally` is true after checking all lines, construct the output by taking the left half of each input line.
4.  Output the resulting lines.
