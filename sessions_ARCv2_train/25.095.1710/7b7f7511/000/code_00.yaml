objects:
  - name: input_data
    type: list_of_lines
    properties:
      - each line is a string of space-separated integers
      - number_of_lines (N)
      - number_of_integers_per_line (M - assumed constant for simplicity, though examples show varying M)
  - name: output_data
    type: list_of_lines
    properties:
      - derived from input_data based on repetition patterns
  - name: line
    type: list_of_integers
  - name: block_of_lines
    type: list_of_lines
properties:
  - repetition_type: vertical | horizontal | none
relationships:
  - output_data is a subset of input_data
  - output_data is generated by removing redundancy from input_data
actions:
  - parse: convert input string lines into lists of integers
  - split_vertically: divide the list of lines into two halves (top and bottom) if N is even
  - split_horizontally: divide each line (list of integers) into two halves (left and right) if M is even
  - compare: check if two blocks of lines or two halves of a line are identical
  - select: choose the appropriate half (top block or left half of lines) as the output
