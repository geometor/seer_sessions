The core transformation appears to involve identifying a repetitive pattern within the input data and then extracting the unique, non-repeated portion.\n\nTwo types of repetition are observed:\n\n1.  **Vertical Repetition:** The entire block of lines repeats itself. For example, in `train_3`, the first three lines (`2 3`, `3 2`, `4 4`) are identical to the last three lines. The output is the first, unique block of lines.\n2.  **Horizontal Repetition:** Within each line, the sequence of numbers repeats itself. For example, in `train_1`, the line `6 4 8 6 4 8` consists of `6 4 8` repeated twice. In `train_2`, `1 1 3 2 1 1 3 2` consists of `1 1 3 2` repeated twice. When this pattern occurs across all lines (and vertical repetition is not present), the output consists of the first half of each line.\n\nThe transformation logic prioritizes checking for vertical repetition first. If found, the output is the first half (vertically) of the input lines. If vertical repetition is not found, it then checks for horizontal repetition within each line. If all lines exhibit horizontal repetition, the output is the first half (horizontally) of each input line.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
