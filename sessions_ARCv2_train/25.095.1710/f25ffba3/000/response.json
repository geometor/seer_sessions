The input grids contain blocks of non-zero numbers, primarily located in the lower portion, surrounded by zeros. The output grids appear to be constructed by manipulating the rows containing non-zero elements from the input. Specifically, the transformation seems to involve identifying the block of rows containing non-zero values, reflecting this block vertically, and then appending the original block below the reflection.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
