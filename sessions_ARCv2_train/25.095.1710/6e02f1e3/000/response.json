Instead, the overall structure and composition of the *entire* input grid determine the structure of the output grid.\n5.  **Key Output Patterns:** Two distinct patterns emerge in the output grids containing 5s:\n    *   The top row is filled with 5s, and the rest are 0s.\n    *   The main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) is filled with 5s, and the rest are 0s.\n    *   The anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) is filled with 5s, and the rest are 0s.\n6.  **Conditions for Patterns:**\n    *   The \"top row 5s\" pattern occurs when the input grid consists of only one unique number (e.g., all 3s in train\\_1, all 4s in train\\_3).\n    *   The \"main diagonal 5s\" pattern occurs when the input grid has multiple unique numbers, *and* there is a single number that appears more frequently than any other number (e.g., train\\_4 where '4' is most frequent, train\\_5 where '3' is most frequent).\n    *   The \"anti-diagonal 5s\" pattern occurs when the input grid has multiple unique numbers, *and* there is no single most frequent number (i.e., there's a tie for the highest frequency, e.g., train\\_2 where 2, 3, and 4 all appear 3 times).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
