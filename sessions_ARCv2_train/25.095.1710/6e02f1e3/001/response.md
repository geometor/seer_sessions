"""
Transforms a 3x3 input grid of digits into a 3x3 output grid containing only 0s and 5s.
The transformation rule depends on the distribution of numbers in the input grid:
1. If the input grid contains only one unique number (uniform), the output grid's first row is filled with 5s, and the rest are 0s.
2. If the input grid contains multiple unique numbers:
   a. If there is a single most frequent number, the output grid's main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) is filled with 5s, and the rest are 0s.
   b. If there is a tie for the most frequent number, the output grid's anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) is filled with 5s, and the rest are 0s.
