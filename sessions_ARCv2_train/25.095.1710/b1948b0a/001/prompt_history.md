**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a 2D grid of numbers. The input grids contain only the numbers 6 and 7. The corresponding output grids contain only the numbers 2 and 7. The transformation appears to be a simple element-wise substitution based on the value of each cell in the input grid. Specifically, the number 6 in the input is consistently replaced by the number 2 in the output, while the number 7 remains unchanged. The dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the grid remain the same between input and output.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Objects:
  - InputGrid: A 2D array of integers.
  - OutputGrid: A 2D array of integers.
  - Cell: An individual element within a grid.

Properties:
  - InputGrid:
    - Contains integers: 6 and 7.
    - Has specific dimensions (rows, columns).
  - OutputGrid:
    - Contains integers: 2 and 7.
    - Has the same dimensions as the corresponding InputGrid.
  - Cell:
    - Has a value (integer).
    - Has a position (row, column).

Actions:
  - Read: Access the value of each Cell in the InputGrid.
  - Evaluate: Check the value of the InputGrid Cell.
  - Substitute: If the InputGrid Cell value is 6, replace it with 2.
  - Keep: If the InputGrid Cell value is 7, keep it as 7.
  - Construct: Create the OutputGrid with the results of the Evaluate, Substitute, and Keep actions, preserving the original grid structure.

Relationships:
  - Positional Correspondence: Each Cell in the OutputGrid corresponds to the Cell at the same (row, column) position in the InputGrid.
  - Value Transformation: The value of a Cell in the OutputGrid is determined solely by the value of the corresponding Cell in the InputGrid based on the substitution rule (6 -> 2, 7 -> 7).
  - Dimensional Integrity: The OutputGrid always has the same number of rows and columns as the InputGrid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid, identified by its row and column index.
3.  For each cell:
    a.  Read the integer value in the current cell of the input grid.
    b.  If the value is 6, place the integer 2 in the corresponding cell (same row and column) of the output grid.
    c.  If the value is 7, place the integer 7 in the corresponding cell (same row and column) of the output grid.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
