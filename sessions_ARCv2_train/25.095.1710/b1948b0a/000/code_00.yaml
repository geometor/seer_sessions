Objects:
  - InputGrid: A 2D array of integers.
  - OutputGrid: A 2D array of integers.
  - Cell: An individual element within a grid.

Properties:
  - InputGrid:
    - Contains integers: 6 and 7.
    - Has specific dimensions (rows, columns).
  - OutputGrid:
    - Contains integers: 2 and 7.
    - Has the same dimensions as the corresponding InputGrid.
  - Cell:
    - Has a value (integer).
    - Has a position (row, column).

Actions:
  - Read: Access the value of each Cell in the InputGrid.
  - Evaluate: Check the value of the InputGrid Cell.
  - Substitute: If the InputGrid Cell value is 6, replace it with 2.
  - Keep: If the InputGrid Cell value is 7, keep it as 7.
  - Construct: Create the OutputGrid with the results of the Evaluate, Substitute, and Keep actions, preserving the original grid structure.

Relationships:
  - Positional Correspondence: Each Cell in the OutputGrid corresponds to the Cell at the same (row, column) position in the InputGrid.
  - Value Transformation: The value of a Cell in the OutputGrid is determined solely by the value of the corresponding Cell in the InputGrid based on the substitution rule (6 -> 2, 7 -> 7).
  - Dimensional Integrity: The OutputGrid always has the same number of rows and columns as the InputGrid.
