The corresponding output grids contain only the numbers 2 and 7. The transformation appears to be a simple element-wise substitution based on the value of each cell in the input grid. Specifically, the number 6 in the input is consistently replaced by the number 2 in the output, while the number 7 remains unchanged. The dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the grid remain the same between input and output.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
