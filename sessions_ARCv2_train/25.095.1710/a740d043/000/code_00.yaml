Data:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and Output are 2D grids of integers.

Input Grid:
  - properties:
      - contains a background value (identified as '1' in examples)
      - contains foreground objects/values (digits other than the background value)
  - objects:
      - background cells: Cells containing the background value.
      - foreground cells: Cells containing values other than the background value.

Output Grid:
  - derivation: Derived from the input grid.
  - content:
      - Contains the foreground values from the input grid.
      - Contains '0's, which correspond to the background value positions within the extracted region.
  - structure: Represents a sub-region of the input grid.

Transformation:
  - action: Identification
    target: Foreground cells (non-'1' values in the input).
  - action: Calculation
    target: Bounding Box
    details: Determine the minimum rectangular area enclosing all identified foreground cells.
  - action: Extraction
    target: Subgrid
    details: Extract the portion of the input grid defined by the bounding box.
  - action: Substitution
    target: Extracted Subgrid
    details: Replace all occurrences of the original background value ('1') within the extracted subgrid with '0'.
  - result: The modified extracted subgrid is the final output.

Relationships:
  - Output grid dimensions are determined by the spatial extent (bounding box) of the foreground cells in the input.
  - Values in the output grid directly map to the foreground values in the input grid within the bounding box.
  - The value '0' in the output grid maps to the background value ('1') locations within the bounding box in the input grid.
