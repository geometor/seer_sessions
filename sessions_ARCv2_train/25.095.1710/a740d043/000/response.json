These objects can be single cells or contiguous blocks of the same digit.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to isolate the non-background elements from the input grid. It extracts a rectangular subgrid that tightly bounds all non-background digits. Within this extracted subgrid, the original non-background digits are preserved, while the background digits ('1') are replaced with '0'.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Find the minimum row index, maximum row index, minimum column index, and maximum column index among all identified foreground cells. These define the coordinates of the bounding box.\n3.
