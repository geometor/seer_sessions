The grids appear to be square and have the same dimensions in the input and output (3x3 in all examples).\n2.  **Content:** The grids contain numerical digits (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 8).\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation modifies the values within the grid cells. Some digits change, while others remain the same. The digit '5' appears prominently in the output, often replacing various input digits.\n4.  **Key Observation:** The digits that *remain unchanged* in the output seem to be the ones that were the *most frequent* in the corresponding input grid. All other digits are changed to '5'.\n\n    *   **train_1:** '2' is most frequent (7 times); '8's change to '5'.\n    *   **train_2:** '1' is most frequent (4 times); '8', '3', and '2's change to '5'.\n    *   **train_3:** '4' is most frequent (3 times); '3', '8', and '1's change to '5'.\n    *   **train_4:** '2' is most frequent (4 times); '1' and '8's change to '5'.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
