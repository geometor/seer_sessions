task_elements:
  - object: Input Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of digits
      - dimensions: NxN (e.g., 3x3)
      - contains: numerical digits (0-9)
  - object: Output Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of digits
      - dimensions: same as Input Grid
      - contains: numerical digits (0-9), specifically including '5' and the most frequent digit from the input.
  - object: Cell
    properties:
      - location: row, column
      - value: digit
  - object: Digit Frequency
    properties:
      - count: number of occurrences within the Input Grid
      - is_most_frequent: boolean
  - relationship: Transformation
    properties:
      - type: cell-wise modification
      - dependency: The output value of a cell depends on its input value and the most frequent digit in the entire Input Grid.
  - action: Identify Most Frequent Digit
    description: Calculate the frequency of each digit present in the Input Grid and determine which digit occurs most often.
    assumptions:
      - If there is a tie for the most frequent digit, the examples do not explicitly cover this, but the logic seems consistent regardless of tie-breaking. Let's assume any one of the tied digits could serve as the 'most frequent' for the rule.
  - action: Map Input Cell to Output Cell
    description: |
      For each cell in the Input Grid:
      - Compare its value to the globally determined most frequent digit.
      - If the cell's value matches the most frequent digit, keep the value unchanged in the Output Grid.
      - If the cell's value does not match the most frequent digit, change the value to '5' in the Output Grid.
