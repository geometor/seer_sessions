objects:
  - name: InputGrid
    type: 2D Array (3x3)
    properties:
      - cells: contain integer values (0-9)
  - name: OutputSequence
    type: 1D Array / List
    properties:
      - elements: integer values (derived from InputGrid)
  - name: GridCell
    properties:
      - value: integer
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: IterateGrid
    input: InputGrid
    description: Traverse the grid cells in row-major order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
  - name: FilterNonZero
    input: GridCell value
    description: Check if the value of a cell is not equal to zero.
  - name: CollectValues
    input: Non-zero GridCell value
    output: OutputSequence
    description: Append the non-zero value to the growing output sequence.

relationships:
  - type: Extraction
    from: InputGrid
    to: OutputSequence
    description: The OutputSequence is composed exclusively of the non-zero integer values extracted from the InputGrid.
  - type: Ordering
    of: OutputSequence elements
    based_on: InputGrid cell positions
    description: The order of elements in the OutputSequence corresponds to the row-major traversal order of the cells in the InputGrid from which the non-zero values were extracted.
