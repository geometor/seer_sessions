The output is a sequence of single-digit integers. The numbers appearing in the output sequence correspond exactly to the non-zero numbers present in the input grid. The order of the numbers in the output sequence appears to follow the standard reading order of the grid: traversing each row from left to right, starting from the top row and moving downwards.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
