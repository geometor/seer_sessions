## Perception

The input is consistently a 3x3 grid containing single-digit integers. Many cells in the grid contain the number 0. The output is a sequence of single-digit integers. The numbers appearing in the output sequence correspond exactly to the non-zero numbers present in the input grid. The order of the numbers in the output sequence appears to follow the standard reading order of the grid: traversing each row from left to right, starting from the top row and moving downwards.

## Facts


```yaml
objects:
  - name: InputGrid
    type: 2D Array (3x3)
    properties:
      - cells: contain integer values (0-9)
  - name: OutputSequence
    type: 1D Array / List
    properties:
      - elements: integer values (derived from InputGrid)
  - name: GridCell
    properties:
      - value: integer
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: IterateGrid
    input: InputGrid
    description: Traverse the grid cells in row-major order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
  - name: FilterNonZero
    input: GridCell value
    description: Check if the value of a cell is not equal to zero.
  - name: CollectValues
    input: Non-zero GridCell value
    output: OutputSequence
    description: Append the non-zero value to the growing output sequence.

relationships:
  - type: Extraction
    from: InputGrid
    to: OutputSequence
    description: The OutputSequence is composed exclusively of the non-zero integer values extracted from the InputGrid.
  - type: Ordering
    of: OutputSequence elements
    based_on: InputGrid cell positions
    description: The order of elements in the OutputSequence corresponds to the row-major traversal order of the cells in the InputGrid from which the non-zero values were extracted.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty sequence to store the output numbers.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, starting from the top row (row 0) and proceeding to the bottom row (row 2).
3.  Within each row, iterate through each cell from left to right (column 0 to column 2).
4.  For each cell encountered, check if its value is not zero.
5.  If the cell's value is not zero, append this value to the end of the output sequence.
6.  After iterating through all cells in the grid, the final output sequence contains all non-zero numbers from the input grid, ordered according to their appearance during the row-major traversal.
