"""
Transforms an input 2D integer grid based on the frequency of its two distinct values.

1. Identify the two unique integer values in the input grid.
2. Count the frequency of each unique value.
3. Determine the minority (less frequent) and majority (more frequent) values.
4. Calculate the absolute difference between their counts.
5. Apply one of two transformation rules based on the count difference:
   - If the difference is 1: Replace minority values with 0 and majority values with the minority value.
   - If the difference is not 1: Replace minority values with the majority value and majority values with 0.
