*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both 2D grids (matrices) of integers with the same dimensions.
    *   Each input grid contains exactly two distinct integer values.
    *   The transformation rule appears to depend on the frequency (count) of these two distinct numbers within the input grid.
    *   The output grid is generated by replacing the original numbers based on a rule derived from their relative frequencies. Specifically, there seem to be two different replacement rules applied, conditioned on the difference between the counts of the two numbers.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - input_grid:
          type: 2D array of integers
          properties:
            - dimensions: [rows, columns]
            - cells: list of cells
            - distinct_values: list containing two unique integers present in the grid
      - output_grid:
          type: 2D array of integers
          properties:
            - dimensions: same as input_grid [rows, columns]
            - cells: list of cells
      - cell:
          type: element within a grid
          properties:
            - value: integer
            - position: [row_index, column_index]
      - distinct_values:
          type: list of two integers
          properties:
            - value1: integer
            - value2: integer
            - count1: frequency of value1 in input_grid
            - count2: frequency of value2 in input_grid
    derived_properties:
      - minority_number: The distinct value with the lower count in the input_grid.
      - majority_number: The distinct value with the higher count in the input_grid.
      - count_difference: The absolute difference between count1 and count2.
    relationships:
      - mapping: Rule determining how input cell values are transformed to output cell values.
    actions:
      - count_frequencies: Determine the count of each distinct value in the input_grid.
      - identify_minority_majority: Assign the distinct values based on their counts.
      - compare_counts: Calculate the absolute difference between the counts.
      - apply_transformation_rule: Replace values in the input grid based on a conditional rule to produce the output grid.
    conditions:
      - is_count_difference_one: Checks if the absolute difference between the counts of the two distinct numbers is exactly 1.
    transformation_rules:
      - rule_A (applied if count_difference is 1):
          - Replace minority_number with 0.
          - Replace majority_number with minority_number.
      - rule_B (applied if count_difference is not 1):
          - Replace minority_number with majority_number.
          - Replace majority_number with 0.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept the input grid.
    2.  Identify the two unique integer values present in the input grid.
    3.  Count the total occurrences (frequency) of each unique value within the entire input grid.
    4.  Determine which value is the `minority_number` (less frequent) and which is the `majority_number` (more frequent).
    5.  Calculate the absolute difference between the counts of the `majority_number` and the `minority_number`.
    6.  Check if this difference is equal to 1.
    7.  **If the difference is exactly 1:**
        *   Create the output grid by iterating through each cell of the input grid.
        *   If an input cell's value is the `minority_number`, set the corresponding output cell's value to 0.
        *   If an input cell's value is the `majority_number`, set the corresponding output cell's value to the `minority_number`.
    8.  **Else (if the difference is not 1):**
        *   Create the output grid by iterating through each cell of the input grid.
        *   If an input cell's value is the `minority_number`, set the corresponding output cell's value to the `majority_number`.
        *   If an input cell's value is the `majority_number`, set the corresponding output cell's value to 0.
    9.  Return the generated output grid.
