The output introduces a new value, 4.\n3.  **Input Pattern:** Each input grid features two distinct, short line segments:\n    *   A vertical segment composed of the value 8.\n    *   A horizontal segment composed of the value 2.\n4.  **Output Pattern:**\n    *   The original line segments (8s and 2s) from the input are preserved in the output.\n    *   The vertical line (8) is extended across its entire column, filling previously background (0) cells, *except* for the cell located in the row of the horizontal line.\n    *   The horizontal line (2) is extended across its entire row, filling previously background (0) cells, *except* for the cell located in the column of the vertical line.\n    *   The cell at the intersection of the extended vertical column and extended horizontal row is assigned the value 4.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Identify: Locate the target column of the Vertical Line Segment (value 8).\n  2. Identify: Locate the target row of the Horizontal Line Segment (value 2).\n  3. Extend Vertical Line:\n     - Iterate through all rows (0-5).\n     - If the current row is NOT the target row AND the cell at (current row, target column) is 0, change its value to 8.\n  4. Extend Horizontal Line:\n     - Iterate through all columns (0-5).\n     - If the current column is NOT the target column AND the cell at (target row, current column) is 0, change its value to 2.\n  5. Mark Intersection: Set the value of the cell at (target row, target column) to 4.\n  6. Preserve: Original non-zero cells from the input remain unchanged unless overwritten by the intersection point.\n\nOrder of Operations:\n  - Identification must happen first.\n  - Extension steps can happen in either order (Vertical then Horizontal, or vice-versa).\n  - Marking the intersection happens last, potentially overwriting a value placed during extension.\n```"
