Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on 6x6 grids containing integer values.
2.  **Colors/Values:** The significant values are 0 (likely background), 2, and 8 in the input. The output introduces a new value, 4.
3.  **Input Pattern:** Each input grid features two distinct, short line segments:
    *   A vertical segment composed of the value 8.
    *   A horizontal segment composed of the value 2.
4.  **Output Pattern:**
    *   The original line segments (8s and 2s) from the input are preserved in the output.
    *   The vertical line (8) is extended across its entire column, filling previously background (0) cells, *except* for the cell located in the row of the horizontal line.
    *   The horizontal line (2) is extended across its entire row, filling previously background (0) cells, *except* for the cell located in the column of the vertical line.
    *   The cell at the intersection of the extended vertical column and extended horizontal row is assigned the value 4.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 2D Array
  Dimensions: 6x6
  Cell Values: Integers (0, 2, 4, 8)

Objects:
  - Type: Background
    Value: 0
  - Type: Vertical Line Segment
    Value: 8
    Property: Occupies a single column.
  - Type: Horizontal Line Segment
    Value: 2
    Property: Occupies a single row.
  - Type: Intersection Point
    Value: 4
    Property: Location where the extended lines meet.

Relationships:
  - Vertical Line Segment defines a specific 'target column'.
  - Horizontal Line Segment defines a specific 'target row'.
  - The Intersection Point is located at (target row, target column).

Actions:
  1. Identify: Locate the target column of the Vertical Line Segment (value 8).
  2. Identify: Locate the target row of the Horizontal Line Segment (value 2).
  3. Extend Vertical Line:
     - Iterate through all rows (0-5).
     - If the current row is NOT the target row AND the cell at (current row, target column) is 0, change its value to 8.
  4. Extend Horizontal Line:
     - Iterate through all columns (0-5).
     - If the current column is NOT the target column AND the cell at (target row, current column) is 0, change its value to 2.
  5. Mark Intersection: Set the value of the cell at (target row, target column) to 4.
  6. Preserve: Original non-zero cells from the input remain unchanged unless overwritten by the intersection point.

Order of Operations:
  - Identification must happen first.
  - Extension steps can happen in either order (Vertical then Horizontal, or vice-versa).
  - Marking the intersection happens last, potentially overwriting a value placed during extension.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find the column index (`target_col`) occupied by the vertical line segment (cells with value 8).
3.  Find the row index (`target_row`) occupied by the horizontal line segment (cells with value 2).
4.  Iterate through each row index `r` from 0 to 5:
    *   If `r` is not equal to `target_row` and the cell at `(r, target_col)` in the output grid currently has the value 0, update the cell `(r, target_col)` to 8.
5.  Iterate through each column index `c` from 0 to 5:
    *   If `c` is not equal to `target_col` and the cell at `(target_row, c)` in the output grid currently has the value 0, update the cell `(target_row, c)` to 2.
6.  Set the value of the cell at the intersection point `(target_row, target_col)` in the output grid to 4.
