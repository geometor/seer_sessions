Grid:
  Type: 2D Array
  Dimensions: 6x6
  Cell Values: Integers (0, 2, 4, 8)

Objects:
  - Type: Background
    Value: 0
  - Type: Vertical Line Segment
    Value: 8
    Property: Occupies a single column.
  - Type: Horizontal Line Segment
    Value: 2
    Property: Occupies a single row.
  - Type: Intersection Point
    Value: 4
    Property: Location where the extended lines meet.

Relationships:
  - Vertical Line Segment defines a specific 'target column'.
  - Horizontal Line Segment defines a specific 'target row'.
  - The Intersection Point is located at (target row, target column).

Actions:
  1. Identify: Locate the target column of the Vertical Line Segment (value 8).
  2. Identify: Locate the target row of the Horizontal Line Segment (value 2).
  3. Extend Vertical Line:
     - Iterate through all rows (0-5).
     - If the current row is NOT the target row AND the cell at (current row, target column) is 0, change its value to 8.
  4. Extend Horizontal Line:
     - Iterate through all columns (0-5).
     - If the current column is NOT the target column AND the cell at (target row, current column) is 0, change its value to 2.
  5. Mark Intersection: Set the value of the cell at (target row, target column) to 4.
  6. Preserve: Original non-zero cells from the input remain unchanged unless overwritten by the intersection point.

Order of Operations:
  - Identification must happen first.
  - Extension steps can happen in either order (Vertical then Horizontal, or vice-versa).
  - Marking the intersection happens last, potentially overwriting a value placed during extension.
