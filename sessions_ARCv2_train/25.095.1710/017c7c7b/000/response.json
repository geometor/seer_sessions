            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are 2D grids (matrices) containing numerical values. Inputs contain only 0s and 1s. Outputs contain only 0s and 2s.\n2.  **Dimensions:** The input grids are 6 rows by 3 columns. The output grids are 9 rows by 3 columns. The number of columns remains constant, while the number of rows increases by 3 (specifically, 1.5 times the original number of rows).\n3.  **Value Transformation:** A consistent value change occurs: every '1' in the input grid is replaced by a '2' in the output grid. The '0's remain unchanged.\n4.  **Structural Transformation:** The output grid consists of the value-transformed input grid followed by 3 additional rows. These 3 appended rows are a specific subset of 3 consecutive rows taken from the value-transformed grid itself.\n5.  **Conditional Logic:** The selection of *which* 3 consecutive rows are appended depends on a condition related to the *original* input grid. Specifically, it depends on comparing the 4th row and the 6th row of the input.\n    *   If the 4th row and 6th row of the input grid are identical, the first 3 rows (rows 1, 2, 3) of the value-transformed grid are appended.\n    *   If the 4th row and 6th row of the input grid are different, the middle 3 rows (rows 3, 4, 5) of the value-transformed grid are appended.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
