Task: Frame Generation

Objects:
  - Input_Grid:
      Type: 2D Array (Matrix)
      Properties:
        - Dimensions (Height, Width)
        - Contains numerical values
        - Predominantly filled with 0
        - Contains exactly one non-zero value (let's call this 'Frame_Color')
        - Position of the Frame_Color value
  - Output_Grid:
      Type: 2D Array (Matrix)
      Properties:
        - Dimensions (same as Input_Grid Height, Width)
        - Contains numerical values
        - Has a border frame
        - Frame color matches the Frame_Color from Input_Grid
        - Interior cells (non-frame) are all 0

Relationships:
  - Output_Grid dimensions are identical to Input_Grid dimensions.
  - The value used to construct the frame in Output_Grid is the single non-zero value (Frame_Color) found anywhere within the Input_Grid.
  - The original position of the Frame_Color in the Input_Grid becomes 0 in the Output_Grid (along with all other interior positions).

Actions:
  - Identify the dimensions (Height H, Width W) of the Input_Grid.
  - Scan the Input_Grid to find the single non-zero value (Frame_Color).
  - Create a new Output_Grid of size H x W, initialized with 0s.
  - Set all cells in the first row (index 0) of Output_Grid to Frame_Color.
  - Set all cells in the last row (index H-1) of Output_Grid to Frame_Color.
  - Set all cells in the first column (index 0) of Output_Grid to Frame_Color.
  - Set all cells in the last column (index W-1) of Output_Grid to Frame_Color.
