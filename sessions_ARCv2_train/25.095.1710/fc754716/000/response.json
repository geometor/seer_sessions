The grid predominantly contains the number 0. There is exactly one non-zero number present in each input grid. The position of this non-zero number varies across examples. The size of the grid also varies.\n2.  **Output:** Each output is also a 2D grid of the same dimensions as its corresponding input. The output grid consists of a frame (the outermost border rows and columns) filled with the non-zero number found in the input. The interior cells (those not part of the frame) are all filled with 0.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
