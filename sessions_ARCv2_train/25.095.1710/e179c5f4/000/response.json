            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Data:** The input is consistently a grid (matrix) of numbers. The grid dimensions vary across examples (10x3, 10x2, 10x4). The grid is predominantly filled with '0's, with a single '1' located at the bottom-left cell (row index = height - 1, column index = 0).\n2.  **Output Data:** The output is also a grid of numbers with the same dimensions as the corresponding input grid. The output grid consists only of '1's and '8's.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve creating a specific pattern of '1's within the output grid, starting from the location corresponding to the input '1', and filling the remaining cells with '8's.\n4.  **Pattern Logic:** The pattern of '1's seems to follow a path. This path starts at the bottom-left corner (where the input '1' was). It moves diagonally upwards, one row up and one column right per step. When the path hits the right boundary (last column), it reflects and starts moving one row up and one column left. When it hits the left boundary (first column), it reflects again and resumes moving one row up and one column right. This continues until the path reaches the top row (row index 0). The cells visited by this path are marked '1' in the output grid.\n5.  **Default Value:** Cells in the output grid that are not part of the traced path are filled with '8'.\n\n**Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with a default value ('8').\n    2. Identify the starting position: bottom-left cell (row = height-1, col = 0).\n    3. Define a path starting from this position.\n    4. Path movement:\n       - Initial direction: Up-Right (row decrement by 1, column increment by 1).\n       - Boundary interaction:\n         - If the next step hits or goes beyond the right boundary (column index >= width - 1), change direction to Up-Left (row decrement by 1, column decrement by 1).\n         - If the next step hits or goes beyond the left boundary (column index <= 0), change direction to Up-Right (row decrement by 1, column increment by 1).\n    5. Path tracing:\n       - Mark the starting cell in the output grid with '1'.\n       - Iteratively move along the path, updating the direction based on boundary reflections.\n       - Mark each cell visited by the path in the output grid with '1'.\n       - Stop when the path reaches the top row (row index = 0).\n    6. Finalization: All cells in the output grid not marked '1' remain '8'.\n\nRelationships:\n  - Output grid dimensions depend on input grid dimensions.\n  - The pattern of '1's in the output originates from the position of the '1' in the input.\n  - The specific path of '1's depends on the grid width and the reflection logic at the boundaries.\n  - The value '8' acts as a background or default fill for non-path cells.\n```"
