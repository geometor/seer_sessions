            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the need to deduplicate numbers within each line while preserving order. However, the results show that this is only the first step. The provided examples demonstrate a second level of deduplication: identical lines resulting from the first step are also deduplicated, again preserving the order of their first appearance.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the transformation process:\n1.  Iterate through each input line.\n2.  Perform ordered deduplication of integers within the current line.\n3.  Store these processed lines temporarily.\n4.  Perform a second ordered deduplication pass on the list of *processed lines*.\n5.  Format the final unique, ordered processed lines as the output.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's analyze the intermediate step (lines after intra-line deduplication) and the final output lines for each example.\n\n"

            "text": "**Analysis of Metrics:**\n\nThe metrics confirm the two-step hypothesis for examples 1 through 4. The `final_lines_match_expected` is `true` for these, showing that applying intra-line deduplication followed by inter-line deduplication produces the correct output.\n\nHowever, Example 5 (`train_5`) fails this test.\n*   Input: `1 1 1\\n2 2 2\\n1 1 1`\n*   Step 1 Output (intermediate): `['1', '2', '1']`\n*   Step 2 Output (deduplicating intermediate): `['1', '2']`\n*   Expected Output: `1\\n2\\n1`\n\nThis means the second deduplication step (removing duplicate *processed* lines) is incorrect. The final output *does* contain duplicate lines (`1` appears twice).\n\n**Revised Assessment (Correction):**\n\nThe previous code *was* actually correct in its logic of only performing intra-line deduplication. The failure reported in the prompt was due to comparing the *entire* output block as a single string, rather than comparing line-by-line outputs generated from line-by-line inputs. The mismatch occurred because the *number of lines* in the output didn't match the expected output for some examples (e.g., Example 1 expected 3 lines, code produced 4).\n\nLooking closely at the *expected outputs*:\n*   Example 1: Input has 4 lines, Output has 3 lines. The last `8 8` input line, which becomes `8` after intra-line deduplication, seems to be dropped.\n*   Example 2: Input has 3 lines, Output has 1 line. The last two `3 4 6` lines are dropped.\n*   Example 3: Input has 3 lines, Output has 1 line. The last two `2 3 3 8 1` lines are dropped.\n*   Example 4: Input has 6 lines, Output has 4 lines. The second `4 4 4 4` and the second `2 2 2 2` are dropped.\n*   Example 5: Input has 3 lines, Output has 3 lines. No lines are dropped.\n\n**Final Hypothesis:**\n\nThe transformation involves two steps:\n1.  Perform ordered deduplication of numbers within each input line.\n2.  Compare the *original* input lines. If an input line is identical to the *immediately preceding* input line, discard the result of its intra-line deduplication. Otherwise, keep the result.\n\nLet's re-test this hypothesis:\n\n*   Example 1:\n    *   `2 2` -> `2` (Keep)\n    *   `6 6` -> `6` (Keep, different from previous input line)\n    *   `8 8` -> `8` (Keep, different from previous input line)\n    *   `8 8` -> `8` (Discard, same as previous input line `8 8`)\n    *   Result: `2\\n6\\n8` (Matches Expected)\n\n*   Example 2:\n    *   `3 4 6` -> `3 4 6` (Keep)\n    *   `3 4 6` -> `3 4 6` (Discard, same as previous input line)\n    *   `3 4 6` -> `3 4 6` (Discard, same as previous input line)\n    *   Result: `3 4 6` (Matches Expected)\n\n*   Example 3:\n    *   `2 3 3 8 1` -> `2 3 8 1` (Keep)\n    *   `2 3 3 8 1` -> `2 3 8 1` (Discard, same as previous input line)\n    *   `2 3 3 8 1` -> `2 3 8 1` (Discard, same as previous input line)\n    *   Result: `2 3 8 1` (Matches Expected)\n\n*   Example 4:\n    *   `4 4 4 4` -> `4` (Keep)\n    *   `4 4 4 4` -> `4` (Discard, same as previous input line)\n    *   `2 2 2 2` -> `2` (Keep, different from previous input line)\n    *   `2 2 2 2` -> `2` (Discard, same as previous input line)\n    *   `8 8 8 8` -> `8` (Keep, different from previous input line)\n    *   `3 3 3 3` -> `3` (Keep, different from previous input line)\n    *   Result: `4\\n2\\n8\\n3` (Matches Expected)\n\n*   Example 5:\n    *   `1 1 1` -> `1` (Keep)\n    *   `2 2 2` -> `2` (Keep, different from previous input line)\n    *   `1 1 1` -> `1` (Keep, different from previous input line)\n    *   Result: `1\\n2\\n1` (Matches Expected)\n\nThis hypothesis holds for all examples.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
