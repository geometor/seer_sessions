**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the need to deduplicate numbers within each line while preserving order. However, the results show that this is only the first step. The provided examples demonstrate a second level of deduplication: identical lines resulting from the first step are also deduplicated, again preserving the order of their first appearance.

The strategy is to refine the transformation process:
1.  Iterate through each input line.
2.  Perform ordered deduplication of integers within the current line.
3.  Store these processed lines temporarily.
4.  Perform a second ordered deduplication pass on the list of *processed lines*.
5.  Format the final unique, ordered processed lines as the output.

**Metrics:**

Let's analyze the intermediate step (lines after intra-line deduplication) and the final output lines for each example.

**Analysis of Metrics:**

The metrics confirm the two-step hypothesis for examples 1 through 4. The `final_lines_match_expected` is `true` for these, showing that applying intra-line deduplication followed by inter-line deduplication produces the correct output.

However, Example 5 (`train_5`) fails this test.
*   Input: `1 1 1\n2 2 2\n1 1 1`
*   Step 1 Output (intermediate): `['1', '2', '1']`
*   Step 2 Output (deduplicating intermediate): `['1', '2']`
*   Expected Output: `1\n2\n1`

This means the second deduplication step (removing duplicate *processed* lines) is incorrect. The final output *does* contain duplicate lines (`1` appears twice).

**Revised Assessment (Correction):**

The previous code *was* actually correct in its logic of only performing intra-line deduplication. The failure reported in the prompt was due to comparing the *entire* output block as a single string, rather than comparing line-by-line outputs generated from line-by-line inputs. The mismatch occurred because the *number of lines* in the output didn't match the expected output for some examples (e.g., Example 1 expected 3 lines, code produced 4).

Looking closely at the *expected outputs*:
*   Example 1: Input has 4 lines, Output has 3 lines. The last `8 8` input line, which becomes `8` after intra-line deduplication, seems to be dropped.
*   Example 2: Input has 3 lines, Output has 1 line. The last two `3 4 6` lines are dropped.
*   Example 3: Input has 3 lines, Output has 1 line. The last two `2 3 3 8 1` lines are dropped.
*   Example 4: Input has 6 lines, Output has 4 lines. The second `4 4 4 4` and the second `2 2 2 2` are dropped.
*   Example 5: Input has 3 lines, Output has 3 lines. No lines are dropped.

**Final Hypothesis:**

The transformation involves two steps:
1.  Perform ordered deduplication of numbers within each input line.
2.  Compare the *original* input lines. If an input line is identical to the *immediately preceding* input line, discard the result of its intra-line deduplication. Otherwise, keep the result.

Let's re-test this hypothesis:

*   Example 1:
    *   `2 2` -> `2` (Keep)
    *   `6 6` -> `6` (Keep, different from previous input line)
    *   `8 8` -> `8` (Keep, different from previous input line)
    *   `8 8` -> `8` (Discard, same as previous input line `8 8`)
    *   Result: `2\n6\n8` (Matches Expected)

*   Example 2:
    *   `3 4 6` -> `3 4 6` (Keep)
    *   `3 4 6` -> `3 4 6` (Discard, same as previous input line)
    *   `3 4 6` -> `3 4 6` (Discard, same as previous input line)
    *   Result: `3 4 6` (Matches Expected)

*   Example 3:
    *   `2 3 3 8 1` -> `2 3 8 1` (Keep)
    *   `2 3 3 8 1` -> `2 3 8 1` (Discard, same as previous input line)
    *   `2 3 3 8 1` -> `2 3 8 1` (Discard, same as previous input line)
    *   Result: `2 3 8 1` (Matches Expected)

*   Example 4:
    *   `4 4 4 4` -> `4` (Keep)
    *   `4 4 4 4` -> `4` (Discard, same as previous input line)
    *   `2 2 2 2` -> `2` (Keep, different from previous input line)
    *   `2 2 2 2` -> `2` (Discard, same as previous input line)
    *   `8 8 8 8` -> `8` (Keep, different from previous input line)
    *   `3 3 3 3` -> `3` (Keep, different from previous input line)
    *   Result: `4\n2\n8\n3` (Matches Expected)

*   Example 5:
    *   `1 1 1` -> `1` (Keep)
    *   `2 2 2` -> `2` (Keep, different from previous input line)
    *   `1 1 1` -> `1` (Keep, different from previous input line)
    *   Result: `1\n2\n1` (Matches Expected)

This hypothesis holds for all examples.

**Natural Language Program:**


```
1. Initialize an empty list called `final_output_lines`.
2. Initialize a variable `previous_input_line` to `None`.
3. Read the input line by line. Let the current raw input line be `current_input_line`.
4. For each `current_input_line`:
   a. **Process the line:**
      i. Initialize an empty list called `unique_numbers_in_order`.
      ii. Initialize an empty set called `seen_numbers`.
      iii. Split `current_input_line` into a sequence of individual numbers.
      iv. Iterate through this sequence of numbers.
      v. For each number encountered:
         - Check if this number is present in `seen_numbers`.
         - If the number is NOT in `seen_numbers`:
           - Add the number to `unique_numbers_in_order`.
           - Add the number to `seen_numbers`.
      vi. Join the numbers in `unique_numbers_in_order` with single spaces to form `processed_line_string`.
   b. **Filter based on previous input line:**
      i. Check if `previous_input_line` is not `None` AND if `current_input_line` is identical to `previous_input_line`.
      ii. If they are identical, discard `processed_line_string` (do nothing further in this loop iteration for output).
      iii. If they are different (or if it's the first line, where `previous_input_line` is `None`), add `processed_line_string` to the `final_output_lines` list.
   c. **Update state:** Set `previous_input_line = current_input_line`.
5. Combine all strings in `final_output_lines`, ensuring each is on a new line, to produce the final output.
