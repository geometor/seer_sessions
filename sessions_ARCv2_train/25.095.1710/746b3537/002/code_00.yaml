task_description: "Process input lines by first removing duplicate numbers within each line while preserving order, and then filtering these results based on consecutive identical input lines."
input_format:
  type: multiline_text
  line_content: space_separated_integers
output_format:
  type: multiline_text
  line_content: space_separated_integers
processing_granularity: line_by_line_with_lookbehind
line_transformation_step_1:
  action: deduplicate_ordered
  elements: integers
  details: "For a given input line, iterate through its numbers. Keep a number only if it hasn't been seen before in that line. Maintain the original relative order."
filtering_step_2:
  action: filter_based_on_previous_input_line
  condition: "Compare the current *raw* input line with the *previous raw* input line."
  outcome_if_same: "Discard the processed result (from step 1) of the current line."
  outcome_if_different: "Keep the processed result (from step 1) of the current line."
  first_line_rule: "Always keep the processed result of the very first input line."
relationship: "Each output line corresponds to the processed result of an input line, excluding those whose original input line was identical to the immediately preceding original input line."
