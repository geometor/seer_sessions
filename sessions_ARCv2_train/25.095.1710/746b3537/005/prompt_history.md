Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input consists of multiple lines of text. Each line contains one or more space-separated integers.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output also consists of multiple lines of text. Each output line corresponds directly to an input line. Each output line contains space-separated integers.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to operate on each line independently. Within each line, duplicate numbers are removed. The order of the *first* appearance of each unique number is preserved.
4.  **Example Walkthrough (train_3):**
    *   Input line: `2 3 3 8 1`
    *   Process:
        *   See `2`. Keep it. Seen: `{2}`. Result: `[2]`
        *   See `3`. Keep it. Seen: `{2, 3}`. Result: `[2, 3]`
        *   See `3`. It's already seen. Ignore it. Seen: `{2, 3}`. Result: `[2, 3]`
        *   See `8`. Keep it. Seen: `{2, 3, 8}`. Result: `[2, 3, 8]`
        *   See `1`. Keep it. Seen: `{2, 3, 8, 1}`. Result: `[2, 3, 8, 1]`
    *   Output line: `2 3 8 1`

**Natural Language Program:**


```
1. Read the input line by line.
2. For each input line:
   a. Initialize an empty list called `unique_numbers_in_order`.
   b. Initialize an empty set called `seen_numbers`.
   c. Split the input line into a sequence of individual numbers.
   d. Iterate through this sequence of numbers.
   e. For each number encountered:
      i. Check if this number is present in the `seen_numbers` set.
      ii. If the number is NOT in `seen_numbers`:
          - Add the number to the `unique_numbers_in_order` list.
          - Add the number to the `seen_numbers` set.
   f. Join the numbers in the `unique_numbers_in_order` list back together with single spaces to form the output line string.
   g. Record this output line string.
3. Combine all the recorded output line strings, ensuring each is on a new line, to produce the final output.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The primary issue identified by the consistent `AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'strip'` across all examples is an incorrect assumption about the input data type in the previous Python code. The code was designed to accept a single multi-line string (`input_str: str`), while the execution environment appears to be providing the input as a pre-parsed structure, most likely a list of lists, where each inner list represents a line and contains integers (e.g., `list[list[int]]`).

The core transformation logic hypothesized previously (two steps: intra-line ordered deduplication, followed by inter-line filtering based on *original* input line identity) seems to correctly predict the output for all examples when applied manually assuming a `list[list[int]]` input.

**Strategy:**
1.  Correct the `transform` function signature and implementation to accept `list[list[int]]` as input.
2.  Modify the internal logic to work directly with lists of integers instead of splitting and joining strings.
3.  Retain the two-step transformation:
    *   First, process each inner list (row) to remove duplicates while preserving the order of the first occurrence.
    *   Second, iterate through the *original* input rows and their corresponding processed rows, keeping a processed row only if its original input row is different from the *immediately preceding original* input row.
4.  The function should return the filtered list of processed rows, matching the `list[list[int]]` structure.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's analyze the structure and relationship between input and output for each example, assuming the input is `list[list[int]]`.

*   **train_1:**
    *   Input: `[[2, 2], [6, 6], [8, 8], [8, 8]]` (4 rows)
    *   Output: `[[2], [6], [8]]` (3 rows)
    *   Observation: The last input row `[8, 8]` is identical to the one before it. Its processed form `[8]` is omitted from the output. Other rows are deduplicated (`[2, 2]` -> `[2]`, `[6, 6]` -> `[6]`, `[8, 8]` -> `[8]`).

*   **train_2:**
    *   Input: `[[3, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6]]` (3 rows)
    *   Output: `[[3, 4, 6]]` (1 row)
    *   Observation: All input rows are identical. Only the processed form of the first row is kept. Rows already contain unique elements, so deduplication has no effect.

*   **train_3:**
    *   Input: `[[2, 3, 3, 8, 1], [2, 3, 3, 8, 1], [2, 3, 3, 8, 1]]` (3 rows)
    *   Output: `[[2, 3, 8, 1]]` (1 row)
    *   Observation: All input rows are identical. The first row is deduplicated (`[2, 3, 3, 8, 1]` -> `[2, 3, 8, 1]`), and only this processed result is kept.

*   **train_4:**
    *   Input: `[[4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4], [2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2], [8, 8, 8, 8], [3, 3, 3, 3]]` (6 rows)
    *   Output: `[[4], [2], [8], [3]]` (4 rows)
    *   Observation: Input row 1 is identical to row 0; its processed form is omitted. Input row 3 is identical to row 2; its processed form is omitted. All other original rows are unique compared to their preceding row, so their deduplicated forms (`[4]`, `[2]`, `[8]`, `[3]`) are kept.

*   **train_5:**
    *   Input: `[[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [1, 1, 1]]` (3 rows)
    *   Output: `[[1], [2], [1]]` (3 rows)
    *   Observation: Row 1 (`[2, 2, 2]`) differs from row 0 (`[1, 1, 1]`). Row 2 (`[1, 1, 1]`) differs from row 1 (`[2, 2, 2]`). Therefore, no rows are filtered out due to duplication with the *immediately preceding* row. Each row is deduplicated (`[1, 1, 1]` -> `[1]`, `[2, 2, 2]` -> `[2]`, `[1, 1, 1]` -> `[1]`).

```


**Natural Language Program:**


```
1. Accept the input as a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers (let's call this `input_grid`).
2. Initialize an empty list called `processed_grid` to store the results of the first processing step for every input row.
3. Iterate through each `input_row` in the `input_grid`:
    a. Initialize an empty list called `unique_numbers_in_order`.
    b. Initialize an empty set called `seen_numbers`.
    c. Iterate through each `number` in the `input_row`.
    d. If the `number` is NOT in `seen_numbers`:
        i. Add the `number` to the `unique_numbers_in_order` list.
        ii. Add the `number` to the `seen_numbers` set.
    e. Append the `unique_numbers_in_order` list to the `processed_grid`.
4. Initialize an empty list called `final_output_grid`.
5. Initialize a variable `previous_input_row` to `None`.
6. Iterate through the `input_grid` using an index `i` from 0 to length-1:
    a. Get the current original row: `current_input_row = input_grid[i]`.
    b. Get the corresponding processed row: `current_processed_row = processed_grid[i]`.
    c. Check if it's the first row (`i == 0`) OR if `current_input_row` is different from `previous_input_row`.
    d. If the condition in step 6c is true:
        i. Append `current_processed_row` to the `final_output_grid`.
    e. Update `previous_input_row = current_input_row` for the next iteration.
7. Return the `final_output_grid`.
```
