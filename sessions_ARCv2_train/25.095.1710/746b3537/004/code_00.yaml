task_description: "Processes a list of lists of integers. First, removes duplicates within each inner list while preserving order. Second, filters the results, keeping only the processed list if its corresponding original input list was different from the immediately preceding original input list."
input_format:
  type: list_of_lists
  inner_list_content: integers
output_format:
  type: list_of_lists
  inner_list_content: integers
processing_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: ordered_deduplication
    target: each inner list (row)
    input: list[int]
    output: list[int] with unique elements in original order
    details: "Iterate through numbers in the list. Keep a number only if it hasn't been seen before in that list. Maintain original relative order."
  - step: 2
    action: inter_list_filtering
    target: the sequence of processed lists based on original input lists
    input: list[list[int]] (original input), list[list[int]] (processed lists from step 1)
    output: filtered list[list[int]]
    details: "Iterate through the original input lists and their corresponding processed lists simultaneously. Keep the Nth processed list if N is 0, or if the Nth original input list is not identical to the (N-1)th original input list."
relationship: "Output is a subset of the results from step 1, filtered based on consecutive identical rows in the original input."
