**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The primary issue identified by the consistent `AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'strip'` across all examples is an incorrect assumption about the input data type in the previous Python code. The code was designed to accept a single multi-line string (`input_str: str`), while the execution environment appears to be providing the input as a pre-parsed structure, most likely a list of lists, where each inner list represents a line and contains integers (e.g., `list[list[int]]`).

The core transformation logic hypothesized previously (two steps: intra-line ordered deduplication, followed by inter-line filtering based on *original* input line identity) seems to correctly predict the output for all examples when applied manually assuming a `list[list[int]]` input.

**Strategy:**
1.  Correct the `transform` function signature and implementation to accept `list[list[int]]` as input.
2.  Modify the internal logic to work directly with lists of integers instead of splitting and joining strings.
3.  Retain the two-step transformation:
    *   First, process each inner list (row) to remove duplicates while preserving the order of the first occurrence.
    *   Second, iterate through the *original* input rows and their corresponding processed rows, keeping a processed row only if its original input row is different from the *immediately preceding original* input row.
4.  The function should return the filtered list of processed rows, matching the `list[list[int]]` structure.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's analyze the structure and relationship between input and output for each example, assuming the input is `list[list[int]]`.

*   **train_1:**
    *   Input: `[[2, 2], [6, 6], [8, 8], [8, 8]]` (4 rows)
    *   Output: `[[2], [6], [8]]` (3 rows)
    *   Observation: The last input row `[8, 8]` is identical to the one before it. Its processed form `[8]` is omitted from the output. Other rows are deduplicated (`[2, 2]` -> `[2]`, `[6, 6]` -> `[6]`, `[8, 8]` -> `[8]`).

*   **train_2:**
    *   Input: `[[3, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6]]` (3 rows)
    *   Output: `[[3, 4, 6]]` (1 row)
    *   Observation: All input rows are identical. Only the processed form of the first row is kept. Rows already contain unique elements, so deduplication has no effect.

*   **train_3:**
    *   Input: `[[2, 3, 3, 8, 1], [2, 3, 3, 8, 1], [2, 3, 3, 8, 1]]` (3 rows)
    *   Output: `[[2, 3, 8, 1]]` (1 row)
    *   Observation: All input rows are identical. The first row is deduplicated (`[2, 3, 3, 8, 1]` -> `[2, 3, 8, 1]`), and only this processed result is kept.

*   **train_4:**
    *   Input: `[[4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4], [2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2], [8, 8, 8, 8], [3, 3, 3, 3]]` (6 rows)
    *   Output: `[[4], [2], [8], [3]]` (4 rows)
    *   Observation: Input row 1 is identical to row 0; its processed form is omitted. Input row 3 is identical to row 2; its processed form is omitted. All other original rows are unique compared to their preceding row, so their deduplicated forms (`[4]`, `[2]`, `[8]`, `[3]`) are kept.

*   **train_5:**
    *   Input: `[[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [1, 1, 1]]` (3 rows)
    *   Output: `[[1], [2], [1]]` (3 rows)
    *   Observation: Row 1 (`[2, 2, 2]`) differs from row 0 (`[1, 1, 1]`). Row 2 (`[1, 1, 1]`) differs from row 1 (`[2, 2, 2]`). Therefore, no rows are filtered out due to duplication with the *immediately preceding* row. Each row is deduplicated (`[1, 1, 1]` -> `[1]`, `[2, 2, 2]` -> `[2]`, `[1, 1, 1]` -> `[1]`).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: "Processes a list of lists of integers. First, removes duplicates within each inner list while preserving order. Second, filters the results, keeping only the processed list if its corresponding original input list was different from the immediately preceding original input list."
input_format:
  type: list_of_lists
  inner_list_content: integers
output_format:
  type: list_of_lists
  inner_list_content: integers
processing_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: ordered_deduplication
    target: each inner list (row)
    input: list[int]
    output: list[int] with unique elements in original order
    details: "Iterate through numbers in the list. Keep a number only if it hasn't been seen before in that list. Maintain original relative order."
  - step: 2
    action: inter_list_filtering
    target: the sequence of processed lists based on original input lists
    input: list[list[int]] (original input), list[list[int]] (processed lists from step 1)
    output: filtered list[list[int]]
    details: "Iterate through the original input lists and their corresponding processed lists simultaneously. Keep the Nth processed list if N is 0, or if the Nth original input list is not identical to the (N-1)th original input list."
relationship: "Output is a subset of the results from step 1, filtered based on consecutive identical rows in the original input."
```


**Natural Language Program:**


```
1. Accept the input as a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers (let's call this `input_grid`).
2. Initialize an empty list called `processed_grid` to store the results of the first processing step for every input row.
3. Iterate through each `input_row` in the `input_grid`:
    a. Initialize an empty list called `unique_numbers_in_order`.
    b. Initialize an empty set called `seen_numbers`.
    c. Iterate through each `number` in the `input_row`.
    d. If the `number` is NOT in `seen_numbers`:
        i. Add the `number` to the `unique_numbers_in_order` list.
        ii. Add the `number` to the `seen_numbers` set.
    e. Append the `unique_numbers_in_order` list to the `processed_grid`.
4. Initialize an empty list called `final_output_grid`.
5. Initialize a variable `previous_input_row` to `None`.
6. Iterate through the `input_grid` using an index `i` from 0 to length-1:
    a. Get the current original row: `current_input_row = input_grid[i]`.
    b. Get the corresponding processed row: `current_processed_row = processed_grid[i]`.
    c. Check if it's the first row (`i == 0`) OR if `current_input_row` is different from `previous_input_row`.
    d. If the condition in step 6c is true:
        i. Append `current_processed_row` to the `final_output_grid`.
    e. Update `previous_input_row = current_input_row` for the next iteration.
7. Return the `final_output_grid`.
