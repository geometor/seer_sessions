"""
Processes input lines by first removing duplicate numbers within each line while preserving order, and then filtering these results based on consecutive identical original input lines. Only the processed result of the first occurrence of a sequence of identical input lines is kept.

def _deduplicate_ordered_list(data_list: list[str]) -> list[str]:

    Removes duplicate strings (representing numbers) from a list while preserving the order of the first occurrence.

    Args:
