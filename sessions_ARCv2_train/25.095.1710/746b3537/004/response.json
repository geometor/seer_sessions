            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe primary issue identified by the consistent `AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'strip'` across all examples is an incorrect assumption about the input data type in the previous Python code. The code was designed to accept a single multi-line string (`input_str: str`), while the execution environment appears to be providing the input as a pre-parsed structure, most likely a list of lists, where each inner list represents a line and contains integers (e.g., `list[list[int]]`).\n\nThe core transformation logic hypothesized previously (two steps: intra-line ordered deduplication, followed by inter-line filtering based on *original* input line identity) seems to correctly predict the output for all examples when applied manually assuming a `list[list[int]]` input.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Correct the `transform` function signature and implementation to accept `list[list[int]]` as input.\n2.  Modify the internal logic to work directly with lists of integers instead of splitting and joining strings.\n3.  Retain the two-step transformation:\n    *   First, process each inner list (row) to remove duplicates while preserving the order of the first occurrence.\n    *   Second, iterate through the *original* input rows and their corresponding processed rows, keeping a processed row only if its original input row is different from the *immediately preceding original* input row.\n4.  The function should return the filtered list of processed rows, matching the `list[list[int]]` structure.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's analyze the structure and relationship between input and output for each example, assuming the input is `list[list[int]]`.\n\n*   **train_1:**\n    *   Input: `[[2, 2], [6, 6], [8, 8], [8, 8]]` (4 rows)\n    *   Output: `[[2], [6], [8]]` (3 rows)\n    *   Observation: The last input row `[8, 8]` is identical to the one before it. Its processed form `[8]` is omitted from the output. Other rows are deduplicated (`[2, 2]` -> `[2]`, `[6, 6]` -> `[6]`, `[8, 8]` -> `[8]`).\n\n*   **train_2:**\n    *   Input: `[[3, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6]]` (3 rows)\n    *   Output: `[[3, 4, 6]]` (1 row)\n    *   Observation: All input rows are identical. Only the processed form of the first row is kept. Rows already contain unique elements, so deduplication has no effect.\n\n*   **train_3:**\n    *   Input: `[[2, 3, 3, 8, 1], [2, 3, 3, 8, 1], [2, 3, 3, 8, 1]]` (3 rows)\n    *   Output: `[[2, 3, 8, 1]]` (1 row)\n    *   Observation: All input rows are identical. The first row is deduplicated (`[2, 3, 3, 8, 1]` -> `[2, 3, 8, 1]`), and only this processed result is kept.\n\n*   **train_4:**\n    *   Input: `[[4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4], [2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2], [8, 8, 8, 8], [3, 3, 3, 3]]` (6 rows)\n    *   Output: `[[4], [2], [8], [3]]` (4 rows)\n    *   Observation: Input row 1 is identical to row 0; its processed form is omitted. Input row 3 is identical to row 2; its processed form is omitted. All other original rows are unique compared to their preceding row, so their deduplicated forms (`[4]`, `[2]`, `[8]`, `[3]`) are kept.\n\n*   **train_5:**\n    *   Input: `[[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [1, 1, 1]]` (3 rows)\n    *   Output: `[[1], [2], [1]]` (3 rows)\n    *   Observation: Row 1 (`[2, 2, 2]`) differs from row 0 (`[1, 1, 1]`). Row 2 (`[1, 1, 1]`) differs from row 1 (`[2, 2, 2]`). Therefore, no rows are filtered out due to duplication with the *immediately preceding* row. Each row is deduplicated (`[1, 1, 1]` -> `[1]`, `[2, 2, 2]` -> `[2]`, `[1, 1, 1]` -> `[1]`).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
