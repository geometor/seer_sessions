Each line contains one or more space-separated integers.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output also consists of multiple lines of text. Each output line corresponds directly to an input line. Each output line contains space-separated integers.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to operate on each line independently. Within each line, duplicate numbers are removed. The order of the *first* appearance of each unique number is preserved.\n4.  **Example Walkthrough (train_3):**\n    *   Input line: `2 3 3 8 1`\n    *   Process:\n        *   See `2`. Keep it. Seen: `{2}`. Result: `[2]`\n        *   See `3`. Keep it. Seen: `{2, 3}`. Result: `[2, 3]`\n        *   See `3`. It's already seen. Ignore it. Seen: `{2, 3}`. Result: `[2, 3]`\n        *   See `8`. Keep it. Seen: `{2, 3, 8}`. Result: `[2, 3, 8]`\n        *   See `1`. Keep it. Seen: `{2, 3, 8, 1}`. Result: `[2, 3, 8, 1]`\n    *   Output line: `2 3 8 1`\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
