The output grid's dimensions are double the input grid's dimensions in both height and width. The output grid is constructed by tiling four versions of the input grid:\n1.  The original input grid in the top-left quadrant.\n2.  A horizontally flipped version of the input grid in the top-right quadrant.\n3.  A vertically flipped version of the input grid in the bottom-left quadrant.\n4.  A version flipped both horizontally and vertically (or rotated 180 degrees) in the bottom-right quadrant.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
