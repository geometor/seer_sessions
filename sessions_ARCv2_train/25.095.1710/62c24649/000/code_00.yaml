Input:
  type: object
  properties:
    grid:
      type: 2D array of integers
      description: A square grid of numbers.
      rows: N
      columns: N
Output:
  type: object
  properties:
    grid:
      type: 2D array of integers
      description: A larger square grid derived from the input.
      rows: 2N
      columns: 2N
Transformation:
  - name: Construct Output Grid
    description: Creates a 2N x 2N grid by combining transformations of the N x N input grid.
    steps:
      - action: Place Original
        source: input grid
        target_quadrant: top-left (rows 0 to N-1, cols 0 to N-1)
        details: The input grid is placed directly into the top-left quadrant of the output grid.
      - action: Flip Horizontal
        source: input grid
        target_quadrant: top-right (rows 0 to N-1, cols N to 2N-1)
        details: The input grid is flipped horizontally and placed into the top-right quadrant.
      - action: Flip Vertical
        source: input grid
        target_quadrant: bottom-left (rows N to 2N-1, cols 0 to N-1)
        details: The input grid is flipped vertically and placed into the bottom-left quadrant.
      - action: Flip Horizontal and Vertical
        source: input grid
        target_quadrant: bottom-right (rows N to 2N-1, cols N to 2N-1)
        details: The input grid is flipped both horizontally and vertically and placed into the bottom-right quadrant.
Relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions are double the input grid dimensions.
  - Each quadrant of the output grid is a specific transformation (identity, horizontal flip, vertical flip, or both flips) of the input grid.
