Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are represented as square grids (specifically 3x3 in all examples) containing single-digit integers (0-9).
2.  **Transformation Type:** The transformation appears to be geometric, specifically a rotation. The content (the digits) remains the same, but their positions within the grid change systematically.
3.  **Relationship:** Comparing the input and output grids in each example strongly suggests a consistent rotational pattern. The element at input position (row, col) moves to a new position in the output grid. For instance, in `train_1`, the element `9` at input `(0, 2)` moves to output `(0, 0)`. The element `0` at input `(0, 0)` moves to output `(2, 0)`. This pattern corresponds to a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. This hypothesis holds true for all provided examples.

**YAML Facts:**

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input grid.
2.  Rotate the entire input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
3.  The resulting grid is the output.
