Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input:** The input is consistently a 3x3 grid of single digits.
2.  **Output:** The output is consistently a 6x6 grid of single digits.
3.  **Size Relationship:** The output grid has dimensions that are twice the dimensions of the input grid (3x3 -> 6x6).
4.  **Structural Pattern:** The output grid appears to be composed of four distinct 3x3 subgrids or quadrants.
5.  **Content Relationship:** Each of these four 3x3 quadrants in the output seems to be a transformed version of the original 3x3 input grid.
6.  **Transformation Type:** The transformation applied to the input grid to generate each quadrant appears to be rotation.
    *   The top-left quadrant of the output is identical to the input (0 degrees rotation).
    *   The top-right quadrant of the output is the input rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
    *   The bottom-left quadrant of the output is the input rotated 270 degrees clockwise (or 90 degrees counter-clockwise).
    *   The bottom-right quadrant of the output is the input rotated 180 degrees.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml

      columns: 6

Relationships:
  - type: composition
    description: The output_grid is composed of four 3x3 quadrants.
  - type: derivation
    description: Each quadrant of the output_grid is derived from the input_grid via rotation.

Actions:
  - action: rotate_grid
    parameters:
      grid: input_grid
      angle: [0, 90_clockwise, 180, 270_clockwise]
    output: rotated_grid
  - action: place_quadrant
    parameters:
      target_grid: output_grid
      source_grid: rotated_grid
      position: [top_left, top_right, bottom_left, bottom_right]

Transformation_Rule:
  - step: 1
    action: Define the output_grid dimensions as twice the input_grid dimensions.
  - step: 2
    action: Divide the output_grid into four equal 3x3 quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).
  - step: 3
    action: Place the input_grid (0 degree rotation) into the top-left quadrant.
  - step: 4
    action: Rotate the input_grid 90 degrees clockwise and place it into the top-right quadrant.
  - step: 5
    action: Rotate the input_grid 270 degrees clockwise (90 degrees counter-clockwise) and place it into the bottom-left quadrant.
  - step: 6
    action: Rotate the input_grid 180 degrees and place it into the bottom-right quadrant.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input 3x3 grid.
2.  Create a new, empty 6x6 grid which will be the output.
3.  Divide the 6x6 output grid mentally into four 3x3 quadrants: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right.
4.  Copy the original 3x3 input grid directly into the top-left quadrant of the output grid.
5.  Rotate the original 3x3 input grid 90 degrees clockwise. Place this rotated grid into the top-right quadrant of the output grid.
6.  Rotate the original 3x3 input grid 270 degrees clockwise (which is equivalent to 90 degrees counter-clockwise). Place this rotated grid into the bottom-left quadrant of the output grid.
7.  Rotate the original 3x3 input grid 180 degrees. Place this rotated grid into the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid.
8.  The resulting 6x6 grid is the final output.
