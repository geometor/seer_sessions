facts:
  objects:
    - name: grid
      properties:
        - type: 2D array of integers
        - dimensions: rows, columns
    - name: cell
      properties:
        - position: (row, column)
        - value: integer (3, 7, or 8)
    - name: number_3
      properties:
        - role: source_value
        - behavior: remains 3, potentially initiates spread
    - name: number_7
      properties:
        - role: fillable_value
        - behavior: can potentially change to 3 based on proximity to source_value and absence of barriers
    - name: number_8
      properties:
        - role: barrier_value
        - behavior: remains 8, blocks the spread of source_value

  actions:
    - name: identify_cells
      parameters:
        - grid
        - value
      returns:
        - list of cell coordinates with the specified value
    - name: spread (transformation_rule)
      inputs:
        - grid
        - source_cells (coordinates of initial value 3)
        - fillable_value (7)
        - barrier_value (8)
      process:
        # This describes the process needed for the EXPECTED output,
        # which differs from the previous code's implementation.
        # The exact mechanism of restriction is unclear from examples alone.
        - Starts from source_cells.
        - Identifies potentially fillable neighbor cells (value 7).
        - Applies an UNDETERMINED CONSTRAINT check to filter which adjacent 7s are actually filled. (Simple adjacency/reachability via 7s is insufficient).
        - Changes qualified fillable_value cells to source_value (3).
        - Propagation continues from newly changed cells, subject to the same constraint.
        - Stops at grid boundaries.
        - Stops at barrier_value cells (8).
      output:
        - modified grid

  relationships:
    - name: adjacency
      between: cell
      definition: Cells sharing an edge (up, down, left, right).
    - name: reachability_via_fillable
      between: cell (source) and cell (fillable)
      condition: A path exists between the cells consisting only of adjacent fillable_value (7) cells, not crossing barrier_value cells or grid boundaries. (Note: The successful transformation seems to use a more constrained version of reachability than this simple definition).
