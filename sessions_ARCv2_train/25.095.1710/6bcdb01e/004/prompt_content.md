"""
Transforms the grid by attempting a flood fill starting from cells with value 3.
The fill spreads to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) with value 7.
The spread is blocked by cells with value 8 (as they are not value 7) and by the grid boundaries.
Cells initially containing 3 remain 3. Cells initially containing 8 remain 8.
Cells initially containing 7 are changed to 3 if they are reachable from an initial 3 cell
through a path of adjacent 7s, subject to a potentially missing constraint identified
during analysis (standard BFS does not yield the expected results).
This implementation uses the standard BFS flood fill, acknowledging it might be incomplete.
