objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: rows, columns
  - name: cell
    properties:
      - position: (row, column)
      - value: integer (specifically 3, 7, or 8 are key)
  - name: number_3
    properties:
      - role: source_value
      - action_trigger: initiates spread
  - name: number_7
    properties:
      - role: fillable_value
      - state: can be changed to source_value
  - name: number_8
    properties:
      - role: barrier_value
      - action_blocker: stops spread

actions:
  - name: identify_cells
    parameters:
      - grid
      - value
    returns:
      - list of cell coordinates with the specified value
  - name: spread
    inputs:
      - grid
      - source_cells (coordinates of cells with value 3)
      - fillable_value (7)
      - barrier_value (8)
    process:
      - starts from source_cells
      - moves to adjacent (up, down, left, right) cells
      - changes fillable_value cells to source_value (3)
      - stops at grid boundaries
      - stops at barrier_value cells
    output:
      - modified grid

relationships:
  - name: adjacency
    between: cell
    definition: Cells sharing an edge (not just a corner).
  - name: reachability
    between: cell (source) and cell (fillable)
    condition: A path exists between the cells consisting only of adjacent source_value or fillable_value cells, not crossing barrier_value cells or grid boundaries.
