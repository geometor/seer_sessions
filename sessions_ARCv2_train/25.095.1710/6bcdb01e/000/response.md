Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and describe the transformation logic.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 2D grid of integers based on specific rules related to the values within the grid.
-   **Input/Output:** Both input and output are rectangular grids (matrices) filled with single-digit integers.
-   **Key Values:** The numbers 3, 7, and 8 appear to have special roles.
    -   `3`: Seems to be a "source" or "seed" value. Its presence triggers changes in neighboring cells.
    -   `7`: Represents a "fillable" or "target" cell. These cells can be changed to 3 under certain conditions.
    -   `8`: Acts as a "barrier" or "wall". The transformation process seems to be blocked by cells containing 8.
-   **Transformation Process:** The transformation appears to be a "flood fill" or "spreading" process originating from the cells initially containing the value 3. The value 3 spreads outwards into adjacent cells containing 7. This spread continues until it encounters a cell containing 8 or the boundary of the grid. Cells containing 8 remain unchanged, as do the original 3s. Cells initially containing 7 that are not reachable from a 3 without crossing an 8 also remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: rows, columns
  - name: cell
    properties:
      - position: (row, column)
      - value: integer (specifically 3, 7, or 8 are key)
  - name: number_3
    properties:
      - role: source_value
      - action_trigger: initiates spread
  - name: number_7
    properties:
      - role: fillable_value
      - state: can be changed to source_value
  - name: number_8
    properties:
      - role: barrier_value
      - action_blocker: stops spread

actions:
  - name: identify_cells
    parameters:
      - grid
      - value
    returns:
      - list of cell coordinates with the specified value
  - name: spread
    inputs:
      - grid
      - source_cells (coordinates of cells with value 3)
      - fillable_value (7)
      - barrier_value (8)
    process:
      - starts from source_cells
      - moves to adjacent (up, down, left, right) cells
      - changes fillable_value cells to source_value (3)
      - stops at grid boundaries
      - stops at barrier_value cells
    output:
      - modified grid

relationships:
  - name: adjacency
    between: cell
    definition: Cells sharing an edge (not just a corner).
  - name: reachability
    between: cell (source) and cell (fillable)
    condition: A path exists between the cells consisting only of adjacent source_value or fillable_value cells, not crossing barrier_value cells or grid boundaries.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify the coordinates of all cells in the input grid that contain the value 3 (source cells).
3.  Initialize a data structure (like a queue or stack) to keep track of cells from which to spread, initially adding all identified source cell coordinates.
4.  Maintain a set of visited cell coordinates to avoid redundant processing, initially containing the source cell coordinates.
5.  While the data structure is not empty:
    a.  Remove a cell coordinate (current\_row, current\_col) from the structure.
    b.  Consider the four adjacent neighbors (neighbor\_row, neighbor\_col): (current\_row-1, current\_col), (current\_row+1, current\_col), (current\_row, current\_col-1), (current\_row, current\_col+1).
    c.  For each neighbor:
        i.  Check if the neighbor's coordinates are within the grid boundaries.
        ii. Check if the neighbor's coordinates have not already been visited.
        iii. Check if the cell at the neighbor's coordinates in the *input* grid contains the value 7 (fillable value).
        iv. If all the above conditions (i, ii, iii) are true:
            1.  Change the value of the cell at (neighbor\_row, neighbor\_col) in the *output* grid to 3.
            2.  Add the neighbor's coordinates to the data structure.
            3.  Add the neighbor's coordinates to the set of visited cells.
6.  Return the final output grid.
