Its presence triggers changes in neighboring cells.\n    -   `7`: Represents a \"fillable\" or \"target\" cell. These cells can be changed to 3 under certain conditions.\n    -   `8`: Acts as a \"barrier\" or \"wall\". The transformation process seems to be blocked by cells containing 8.\n-   **Transformation Process:** The transformation appears to be a \"flood fill\" or \"spreading\" process originating from the cells initially containing the value 3. The value 3 spreads outwards into adjacent cells containing 7. This spread continues until it encounters a cell containing 8 or the boundary of the grid. Cells containing 8 remain unchanged, as do the original 3s. Cells initially containing 7 that are not reachable from a 3 without crossing an 8 also remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
