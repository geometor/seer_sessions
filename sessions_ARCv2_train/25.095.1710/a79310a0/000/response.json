The output grids have the same dimensions as the input grids and contain the numbers 0 and 2. The number 0 appears to represent the background or empty space, which remains unchanged in position. The number 8 seems to represent an object or a set of objects. In the output, these objects appear to have moved and changed their value to 2. Comparing the input and output grids across the examples reveals a consistent pattern: every cell containing an 8 in the input corresponds to a cell containing a 2 in the output, located exactly one row below the original position.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
