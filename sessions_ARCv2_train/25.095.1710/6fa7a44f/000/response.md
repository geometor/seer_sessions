*   **Perception:**
    *   The input consists of multiple lines, each containing space-separated numbers, representing rows of a grid.
    *   The output also consists of multiple lines of space-separated numbers.
    *   Comparing the input and output in each example, the output appears to be the original input rows followed by the same rows but in reverse order. The content of the rows themselves remains unchanged.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - name: input_grid
        properties:
          - type: list of strings
          - each string represents a row
      - name: output_grid
        properties:
          - type: list of strings
          - derived from input_grid
    actions:
      - name: reverse_rows
        input: input_grid (list of rows)
        output: reversed_input_grid (list of rows in reverse order)
      - name: concatenate_rows
        input: 
          - original_rows (input_grid)
          - reversed_rows (reversed_input_grid)
        output: output_grid (concatenated list)
    relationships:
      - The output_grid is formed by taking the original input_grid rows and appending the reversed_input_grid rows to them.
      - The number of rows in the output is double the number of rows in the input.
      - The content of each individual row remains identical between input and corresponding output sections.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Read the input as a list of lines (rows).
    2.  Create a reversed copy of this list of lines.
    3.  Combine the original list of lines with the reversed list of lines, maintaining the order within each list (original first, then reversed).
    4.  The combined list represents the lines of the output.
