"""
Transforms a 3x3 input grid into a 6x6 output grid by propagating non-zero 
values diagonally downwards and to the right. Each cell (r_out, c_out) in 
the output grid gets its value by tracing diagonally upwards and to the left 
(decrementing both row and column indices) until a cell within the original 
3x3 input grid is found. If the value at this corresponding input cell 
(r_in, c_in) is non-zero, that value is assigned to output_grid[r_out][c_out]. 
If the trace goes out of the 3x3 input grid bounds before finding a non-zero 
value, or if the first encountered value within bounds is zero, the output 
cell's value remains 0.
