Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input:** The input is consistently a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers.
2.  **Output:** The output is consistently a 6x6 grid of single-digit integers.
3.  **Transformation:** The output grid seems to be generated by propagating the non-zero values from the input grid diagonally downwards and to the right.
4.  **Rule for Overlap:** When multiple input values could potentially propagate to the same output cell along different diagonals, the value that originates "closest" (smallest diagonal shift, or traced back diagonally up-left to the nearest non-zero input cell) determines the output cell's value. If tracing back diagonally from an output cell does not encounter a non-zero input cell within the 3x3 bounds, the output cell's value is 0.

**Facts:**

    details: Each cell (r_out, c_out) in the output grid gets its value from a cell (r_in, c_in) in the input grid.

  - name: determine_output_cell_value
    inputs:
      - output_cell_coordinates: (r_out, c_out)
      - input_grid
    output:
      - cell_value
    logic: |
      Iterate backwards diagonally from (r_out, c_out) by an offset k, starting k=0.
      Calculate potential input coordinates (r_in = r_out - k, c_in = c_out - k).
      Check if (r_in, c_in) are valid coordinates within the 3x3 input_grid (0 <= r_in < 3 and 0 <= c_in < 3).
      If valid coordinates are found:
        Retrieve the value 'val' from input_grid[r_in][c_in].
        If 'val' is non-zero, this is the value for output_grid[r_out][c_out]. Stop searching for this output cell.
      If the diagonal trace goes out of input_grid bounds before finding a non-zero value, the output cell value is 0.
  - name: generate_output_grid
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    output:
      - output_grid
    logic: |
      Initialize a 6x6 grid with zeros.
      For each cell (r_out, c_out) in the 6x6 grid:
        Determine its value using the 'determine_output_cell_value' action.
        Assign the determined value to the output grid at (r_out, c_out).
      Return the completed 6x6 output grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize a new 6x6 grid, `output_grid`, filling it with zeros.
2.  Iterate through each cell of the `output_grid` using its row index `r_out` (from 0 to 5) and column index `c_out` (from 0 to 5).
3.  For each cell `(r_out, c_out)` in the `output_grid`:
    a.  Start searching diagonally backwards (up and left) from this cell. Iterate with a diagonal offset `k` starting from 0 and increasing.
    b.  Calculate the corresponding potential input coordinates: `r_in = r_out - k` and `c_in = c_out - k`.
    c.  Check if these input coordinates `(r_in, c_in)` are within the bounds of the original 3x3 input grid (i.e., `0 <= r_in < 3` and `0 <= c_in < 3`).
    d.  If the coordinates `(r_in, c_in)` are within the bounds of the input grid:
        i.  Retrieve the value `value = input_grid[r_in][c_in]`.
        ii. If `value` is not zero, then assign this `value` to the current output cell: `output_grid[r_out][c_out] = value`. Then, stop searching for this specific output cell `(r_out, c_out)` and proceed to the next output cell.
    e.  If the coordinates `(r_in, c_in)` fall outside the input grid bounds (i.e., `r_in` or `c_in` becomes negative), stop the diagonal search for the current output cell `(r_out, c_out)`. The cell retains its initial value of 0.
4.  After iterating through all cells of the `output_grid`, return the completed `output_grid`.
