Okay, let's break down the transformation logic based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Data:** The input consists of multi-line strings, where each line contains space-separated single digits. This structure represents a 2D grid or matrix of numbers.
2.  **Output Data:** The output is also a multi-line string of space-separated digits, forming a larger 2D grid compared to the input grid.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to involve expanding the input grid by adding border elements and duplicating certain elements from the original grid into the new border regions.
4.  **Padding Pattern:**
    *   A new row is added at the top. This row consists of a `0`, followed by the first row of the input, followed by another `0`.
    *   A new row is added at the bottom. This row consists of a `0`, followed by the last row of the input, followed by another `0`.
    *   For each original row in the input, a corresponding row is generated in the output. This generated row starts with the first element of the original row, is followed by the original row itself, and ends with the last element of the original row.
5.  **Dimensionality:** If the input grid has dimensions Height (H) x Width (W), the output grid has dimensions (H+2) x (W+2).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input as a grid of numbers (let's call it `input_grid`). Let `H` be the number of rows and `W` be the number of columns in `input_grid`.
2.  Initialize an empty list called `output_rows` to store the rows of the final output grid.
3.  Create the top border row: Take the first row of `input_grid`, place a `0` before its first element, and place a `0` after its last element. Add this new row to `output_rows`.
4.  Iterate through each row of the `input_grid` (from the first row, index 0, to the last row, index H-1):
    *   For the current `input_row`:
        *   Get the first element of `input_row`.
        *   Get the last element of `input_row`.
        *   Create a new row by placing the first element before `input_row` and the last element after `input_row`.
        *   Add this newly created row to `output_rows`.
5.  Create the bottom border row: Take the last row of `input_grid`, place a `0` before its first element, and place a `0` after its last element. Add this new row to `output_rows`.
6.  Combine all rows in `output_rows` to form the final `output_grid`.
7.  Format the `output_grid` into the required string representation (elements separated by spaces, rows separated by newlines).
