**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of single digits into another 3x3 grid of single digits. By comparing the input and output grids across the examples, it appears the transformation is a spatial rearrangement of the elements within the grid. Specifically, the output grid seems to be a 180-degree rotation of the input grid. The element at the top-left corner moves to the bottom-right, the element at the top-right moves to the bottom-left, the center element stays in place, and so on.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    rows: 3
    columns: 3
    elements:
      type: single digit integer
properties:
  - position:
      location: specified by row and column index within the grid
action:
  - name: rotate
    target: input grid
    angle: 180 degrees
relationship:
  - type: spatial transformation
    description: The output grid is the input grid rotated by 180 degrees. Each element at index (r, c) in the input moves to index (2-r, 2-c) in the output (using 0-based indexing).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

Rotate the input 3x3 grid by 180 degrees to produce the output grid.
