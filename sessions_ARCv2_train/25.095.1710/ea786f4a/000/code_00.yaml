Task: Grid Transformation based on Manhattan Distance Parity

Objects:
  - InputGrid:
      Type: 2D List/Array of Integers
      Properties:
        - rows: Integer (number of rows)
        - columns: Integer (number of columns)
        - cells: List of Lists of Integers
        - background_value: Integer (the non-zero value filling most of the grid)
        - zero_position: Tuple (row_index, column_index) of the '0' cell
  - OutputGrid:
      Type: 2D List/Array of Integers
      Properties:
        - rows: Integer (same as InputGrid)
        - columns: Integer (same as InputGrid)
        - cells: List of Lists of Integers
  - Cell:
      Type: Element within a Grid
      Properties:
        - value: Integer
        - position: Tuple (row_index, column_index)

Relationships:
  - OutputGrid dimensions are identical to InputGrid dimensions.
  - A Cell's value in the OutputGrid depends on its position relative to the InputGrid's zero_position.

Actions:
  - Identify the background_value in the InputGrid.
  - Locate the zero_position in the InputGrid.
  - For each Cell position (r, c) in the target OutputGrid dimensions:
      - Calculate the Manhattan distance between (r, c) and the zero_position.
      - Determine if the Manhattan distance is even or odd.
      - Set the OutputGrid Cell value at (r, c):
          - to '0' if the Manhattan distance is even.
          - to the background_value if the Manhattan distance is odd.

Derived Properties:
  - Manhattan Distance:
      Definition: For two positions (r1, c1) and (r2, c2), the distance is |r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|.
      Usage: Calculated between each potential output cell position and the input zero_position.
  - Parity:
      Definition: Whether an integer is even or odd.
      Usage: Applied to the calculated Manhattan distance.
