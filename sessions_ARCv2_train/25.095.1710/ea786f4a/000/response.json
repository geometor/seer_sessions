All other cells contain a uniform positive integer (e.g., 2, 1, or 3), which acts as a \"background\" value.\n3.  **Output Content:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. It contains cells with the value '0' and cells with the original background value. The '0' from the input grid always corresponds to a '0' in the same position in the output grid. Additional cells in the output grid are also changed to '0'.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation seems to depend on the position of the '0' in the input grid. The cells that become '0' in the output form a pattern related to their distance from the original '0'. Specifically, the pattern resembles cells whose Manhattan distance (sum of absolute differences in row and column coordinates) from the original '0' is an even number.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
