The input grid has a distinct pattern where the top rows contain non-zero numbers, and the remaining rows are filled with zeros. The output grid retains the top non-zero rows from the input and also places a vertically mirrored copy of these non-zero rows at the very bottom, overwriting the original zero rows in those positions. The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "

Determine the number of rows in `TopBlock`, let this be `N`.\n    3.  Create a new grid, `OutputGrid`, with the same dimensions as the input grid.\n    4.

Replace the last `N` rows of the `OutputGrid` with the rows from `MirroredBlock`. Specifically, the first row of `MirroredBlock` replaces row `H-N` of `OutputGrid`, the second row of `MirroredBlock` replaces row `H-N+1`, and so on, until the last row of `MirroredBlock` replaces the last row (`H-1`) of `OutputGrid` (where `H` is the total height of the grid).\n    7.
