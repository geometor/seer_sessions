Task: Value Replacement in Grid

Objects:
  - name: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - rows: integer (number of rows)
      - columns: integer (number of columns)
      - cells: list of Cell objects
  - name: Cell
    properties:
      - row_index: integer
      - column_index: integer
      - value: integer

Relationships:
  - Grid contains Cells.
  - Input Grid maps to Output Grid.
  - Output Grid has the same dimensions as Input Grid.
  - Each Cell in the Input Grid corresponds to a Cell at the same coordinates in the Output Grid.

Actions:
  - Iterate through each Cell in the Input Grid.
  - Check the value of the current Cell.
  - If the value is 7, set the value of the corresponding Cell in the Output Grid to 5.
  - If the value is not 7, set the value of the corresponding Cell in the Output Grid to the same value as the Input Grid Cell.
