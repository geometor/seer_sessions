Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are structured as 2D grids (matrices) containing single-digit non-negative integers.
2.  **Grid Dimensions:** The dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the output grid are identical to the dimensions of the input grid in all examples.
3.  **Value Transformation:** Observing the changes between input and output grids, the primary transformation involves the integer `7`. Specifically, occurrences of the integer `7` in the input grid appear to be replaced by the integer `5` in the corresponding position in the output grid.
4.  **Other Values:** Integers other than `7` (e.g., `1`, `8`) seem to remain unchanged in their respective positions.
5.  **Positional Independence:** The transformation of `7` to `5` does not appear to depend on the position (row or column index) within the grid. It applies universally to all `7`s.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Value Replacement in Grid

Objects:
  - name: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - rows: integer (number of rows)
      - columns: integer (number of columns)
      - cells: list of Cell objects
  - name: Cell
    properties:
      - row_index: integer
      - column_index: integer
      - value: integer

Relationships:
  - Grid contains Cells.
  - Input Grid maps to Output Grid.
  - Output Grid has the same dimensions as Input Grid.
  - Each Cell in the Input Grid corresponds to a Cell at the same coordinates in the Output Grid.

Actions:
  - Iterate through each Cell in the Input Grid.
  - Check the value of the current Cell.
  - If the value is 7, set the value of the corresponding Cell in the Output Grid to 5.
  - If the value is not 7, set the value of the corresponding Cell in the Output Grid to the same value as the Input Grid Cell.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid, identified by its row and column index.
3.  For the current cell, retrieve its integer value.
4.  Check if the retrieved value is equal to 7.
5.  If the value is 7, place the integer 5 in the corresponding cell (same row and column index) of the output grid.
6.  If the value is not 7, place the original value in the corresponding cell of the output grid.
7.  After iterating through all cells, the output grid represents the final transformed result.
