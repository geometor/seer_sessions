Specifically, occurrences of the integer `7` in the input grid appear to be replaced by the integer `5` in the corresponding position in the output grid.\n4.  **Other Values:** Integers other than `7` (e.g., `1`, `8`) seem to remain unchanged in their respective positions.\n5.  **Positional Independence:** The transformation of `7` to `5` does not appear to depend on the position (row or column index) within the grid. It applies universally to all `7`s.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
