*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a 2D grid of numbers. The transformation seems to operate row by row. Observing the examples, the dimensions of the grid remain unchanged. The key difference lies in specific rows. In both examples, rows with even indices (0, 2, ...) are identical in the input and output. Rows with odd indices (1, 3, ...) are modified. The modification applied to the odd rows appears to be a right circular shift of the elements within that row. The last element moves to the beginning, and all other elements shift one position to the right.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - name: grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array of integers
          - has rows and columns
      - name: row
        properties:
          - type: 1D array (list) of integers
          - has an index (position within the grid, starting from 0)
          - contains elements (cells)
      - name: element
        properties:
          - type: integer
          - has a position within a row
    actions:
      - name: right_circular_shift
        description: Moves the last element of a sequence to the first position, shifting all other elements one position to the right.
        applied_to: row
    relationships:
      - description: The transformation is applied conditionally based on the row's index.
        condition: row_index % 2 != 0 (row index is odd)
        action: apply right_circular_shift to the row
      - description: Rows with even indices remain unchanged.
        condition: row_index % 2 == 0 (row index is even)
        action: copy the row directly from input to output
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Process the input grid row by row, using a 0-based index for the rows.
    2.  For each row:
        a.  Determine if the row's index is even or odd.
        b.  If the index is **odd**:
            i.  Take the elements of the current row.
            ii. Perform a right circular shift on these elements: move the last element to the beginning of the row and shift all other elements one position to the right.
            iii. Use this shifted row as the corresponding row in the output grid.
        c.  If the index is **even**:
            i.  Copy the row directly from the input grid to the corresponding row in the output grid without any changes.
    3.  Combine the processed rows to form the final output grid.
