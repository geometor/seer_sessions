Observing the examples, the dimensions of the grid remain unchanged. The key difference lies in specific rows. In both examples, rows with even indices (0, 2, ...) are identical in the input and output. Rows with odd indices (1, 3, ...) are modified. The modification applied to the odd rows appears to be a right circular shift of the elements within that row. The last element moves to the beginning, and all other elements shift one position to the right.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
