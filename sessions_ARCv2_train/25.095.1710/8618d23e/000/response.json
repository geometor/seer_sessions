            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Data:** The input and output are grids (2D arrays) containing single-digit integers (0-9). They are represented textually with space-separated digits per row and newline characters between rows.\n2.  **Dimensionality Change:** The output grid is always larger than the input grid. Specifically, the output grid has one more row and one more column than the input grid.\n3.  **Padding Character:** The digit '9' appears frequently in the output, particularly along the newly added row and column, suggesting it's used as a padding or default value.\n4.  **Structure Preservation/Shift:** Parts of the input grid seem to be copied into the output grid, but not contiguously. There appears to be a split or shift involved.\n5.  **Split Point:** Observing the examples, the input grid seems to be split horizontally. The top part maps to the top-left of the output, and the bottom part maps to the bottom-right of the output, offset by one row and one column. The split occurs exactly halfway down the input grid (e.g., after row 1 for 4 rows, after row 0 for 2 rows, after row 2 for 6 rows).\n6.  **Padding Insertion:** The added row and column, filled mostly with '9's, effectively act as a separator inserted between the mapped top and bottom halves of the original input. The cell at the intersection of this new row and column (at index `[split_row, 0]` relative to the top half, or `[split_row, col]` in the output grid - no wait, the intersection is more complex - it's the cells not covered by the copy operations) remains '9'. The new row is at index `split_row`, and the new column is at index `C` (input columns). The elements `Output[split_row][:]` and `Output[:][C]` are mostly 9s, except where overwritten by the second copy operation. More accurately, the grid is initialized with 9s, and then the two parts are copied over.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
