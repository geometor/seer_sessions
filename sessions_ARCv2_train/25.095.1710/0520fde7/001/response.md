"""
Transforms a 3x7 input grid into a 3x3 output grid based on a comparison rule.

The input grid is conceptually divided into two 3x3 subgrids (left and right)
separated by a central column (index 3, typically containing '5').
The output grid is generated by comparing corresponding cells in the left and
right subgrids. If a cell at position (r, c) has the value 1 in *both* the
left subgrid (input_grid[r][c]) and the right subgrid (input_grid[r][c+4]),
then the corresponding cell in the output grid (output_grid[r][c]) is set to 2.
Otherwise, the output cell is set to 0.
