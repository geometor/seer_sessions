*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input is a grid (matrix) of integers.
    *   The input grid consistently has 3 rows and 7 columns.
    *   The values in the input grid appear to be primarily 0, 1, and 5.
    *   The number 5 consistently occupies the 4th column (index 3), acting as a vertical separator.
    *   The output is also a grid of integers.
    *   The output grid consistently has 3 rows and 3 columns.
    *   The values in the output grid are 0 and 2.
    *   The structure suggests the input grid is divided into two smaller 3x3 grids by the central column of 5s.
    *   The output grid's values seem dependent on the corresponding values in the two 3x3 subgrids derived from the input.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    Objects:
      - InputGrid:
          Properties:
            - rows: 3
            - columns: 7
            - values: integers (0, 1, 5)
            - structure: Contains a central separator column (value 5 at index 3)
      - LeftSubgrid:
          Properties:
            - rows: 3
            - columns: 3
            - source: Columns 0-2 of InputGrid
            - values: integers (0, 1)
      - RightSubgrid:
          Properties:
            - rows: 3
            - columns: 3
            - source: Columns 4-6 of InputGrid
            - values: integers (0, 1)
      - OutputGrid:
          Properties:
            - rows: 3
            - columns: 3
            - values: integers (0, 2)
    Actions:
      - Split: Divide InputGrid into LeftSubgrid and RightSubgrid using the central column (index 3) as a delimiter.
      - Compare: Perform an element-wise comparison between LeftSubgrid and RightSubgrid.
      - Assign: Set the value of an element in OutputGrid based on the comparison result.
    Relationships:
      - Correspondence: Each element at position (row, col) in OutputGrid corresponds to the elements at the same position (row, col) in LeftSubgrid and RightSubgrid.
      - Condition: The value of an element in OutputGrid is determined by a condition applied to the corresponding elements in LeftSubgrid and RightSubgrid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the input grid which has 3 rows and 7 columns.
    2.  Locate the central column (index 3) containing the value 5, which acts as a separator.
    3.  Define the "Left Subgrid" as the first 3 columns (indices 0, 1, 2) of the input grid.
    4.  Define the "Right Subgrid" as the last 3 columns (indices 4, 5, 6) of the input grid.
    5.  Create a new "Output Grid" with the same dimensions as the subgrids (3 rows and 3 columns), initially filled with zeros.
    6.  Iterate through each cell position (row `r`, column `c`) from `r=0` to `2` and `c=0` to `2`.
    7.  For the current cell position (`r`, `c`), compare the value in the Left Subgrid at (`r`, `c`) with the value in the Right Subgrid at (`r`, `c`).
    8.  If the value in the Left Subgrid at (`r`, `c`) is 1 AND the value in the Right Subgrid at (`r`, `c`) is 1, set the value of the Output Grid at position (`r`, `c`) to 2.
    9.  Otherwise (if the condition in step 8 is not met), the value in the Output Grid at position (`r`, `c`) remains 0.
    10. The final Output Grid is the result of the transformation.
