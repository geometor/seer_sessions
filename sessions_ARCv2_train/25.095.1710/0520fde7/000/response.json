Define the \"Right Subgrid\" as the last 3 columns (indices 4, 5, 6) of the input grid.\n    5.  Create a new \"Output Grid\" with the same dimensions as the subgrids (3 rows and 3 columns), initially filled with zeros.\n    6.  Iterate through each cell position (row `r`, column `c`) from `r=0` to `2` and `c=0` to `2`.\n    7.  For the current cell position (`r`, `c`), compare the value in the Left Subgrid at (`r`, `c`) with the value in the Right Subgrid at (`r`, `c`).\n    8.  If the value in the Left Subgrid at (`r`, `c`) is 1 AND the value in the Right Subgrid at (`r`, `c`) is 1, set the value of the Output Grid at position (`r`, `c`) to 2.\n    9.  Otherwise (if the condition in step 8 is not met), the value in the Output Grid at position (`r`, `c`) remains 0.\n    10. The final Output Grid is the result of the transformation."
