The output grid's dimensions (height and width) are exactly double those of the input grid. Each number (or color) present in a cell of the input grid appears as a 2x2 block of the same number in the corresponding scaled position within the output grid. Cells with the value 0 in the input also result in a 2x2 block of 0s in the output. This transformation is consistent across both examples, indicating a pixel scaling or nearest-neighbor upscaling operation by a factor of 2.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
