**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of digits. By observing the input and output pairs, it becomes clear that the transformation involves rearranging the rows of the grid. Specifically, each row appears to shift downwards by one position. The bottom-most row wraps around to become the top-most row in the output grid. The content within each row remains unchanged, only its vertical position is altered.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Objects:
  - name: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array (3x3)
      - content: digits (0, 1, 2)
  - name: Row
    properties:
      - type: 1D array (length 3)
      - content: digits (0, 1, 2)
      - relationship: component of Grid
Relationships:
  - type: positional
    between: [Row, Grid]
    details: Each row has a vertical index (0, 1, 2) within the grid.
Actions:
  - name: Circular Vertical Shift
    target: Grid
    direction: Downwards
    amount: 1 position
    effect: Row at index `i` moves to index `(i + 1) % 3`. The last row (index 2) moves to the first row (index 0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input 3x3 grid.
2.  Identify the three rows of the grid: the top row, the middle row, and the bottom row.
3.  Shift the top row down to become the middle row in the output grid.
4.  Shift the middle row down to become the bottom row in the output grid.
5.  Shift the bottom row up to become the top row in the output grid (wrap-around).
6.  Construct the output grid using these shifted rows.
