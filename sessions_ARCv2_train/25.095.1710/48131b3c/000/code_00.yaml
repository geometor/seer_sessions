task_description: Transform an input grid into an output grid of doubled dimensions based on row swapping and duplication.
input_object:
  type: grid
  properties:
    data_type: integer
    shape: NxN (square)
output_object:
  type: grid
  properties:
    data_type: integer
    shape: 2Nx2N (square)
transformation_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: modify_input
    details: Create a temporary grid by swapping the first row (index 0) and the second row (index 1) of the input grid. All other rows remain in their original positions relative to each other. Let N be the dimension of the input grid. If N < 2, this step has no effect.
  - step: 2
    action: build_intermediate_grid
    details: Create an intermediate grid with dimensions N x 2N. For each row `i` (from 0 to N-1) in the modified input grid, the corresponding row `i` in the intermediate grid is formed by concatenating the modified input grid's row `i` with itself horizontally.
  - step: 3
    action: build_output_grid
    details: Create the final output grid with dimensions 2N x 2N. The top half (rows 0 to N-1) of the output grid is identical to the intermediate grid. The bottom half (rows N to 2N-1) of the output grid is also identical to the intermediate grid (i.e., the intermediate grid is vertically stacked upon itself).
relationships:
  - output_dimensions: are double the input_dimensions (height and width).
  - output_content: derived from input_content via row swapping and duplication.
  - output_structure: exhibits a 2x2 tiling pattern based on a modified version of the input.
