If the input is N x N, the output is 2N x 2N.\n3.  **Row Transformation:** Examining the relationship between input rows and output rows reveals a specific pattern:\n    *   The first row of the output is formed by taking the *second* row of the input and repeating it horizontally twice.\n    *   The second row of the output is formed by taking the *first* row of the input and repeating it horizontally twice.\n    *   Subsequent rows (from index 2 up to N-1) in the *first half* of the output grid (rows 0 to N-1) are formed by taking the corresponding input row (index 2 to N-1) and repeating it horizontally twice.\n4.  **Grid Duplication:** The entire top half of the output grid (rows 0 to N-1) is identical to the bottom half of the output grid (rows N to 2N-1). The pattern generated in the first N rows is simply duplicated vertically.\n5.  **Core Operation:** The fundamental operations are:\n    *   Swapping the first two rows of the input grid.\n    *   Horizontally duplicating each row of the modified input grid.\n    *   Vertically duplicating the resulting grid block.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
