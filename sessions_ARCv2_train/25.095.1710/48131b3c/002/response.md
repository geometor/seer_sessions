**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code correctly identified the output dimension increase (2N x 2N) and the horizontal/vertical duplication pattern present in Example 1. However, it failed on Examples 2 and 3, indicating the rule for generating the content being duplicated was not fully captured. Specifically, the transformation applied to rows with index `i >= 2` was incorrect.

The errors in Examples 2 and 3 reveal that the content of the duplicated block isn't simply derived by swapping the first two rows of the input and then duplicating rows horizontally. Instead, a more complex transformation is needed to create a "base" N x N grid first. This base grid involves:
1.  Swapping the first two rows of the input.
2.  For rows `i >= 2`, deriving a new row by replacing 0s with the primary non-zero digit (`P`) found in the input, and replacing occurrences of `P` with 0.

The final output is then constructed by tiling this N x N base grid in a 2x2 pattern.

The strategy is to:
1.  Refine the perception of the transformation steps, incorporating the rule for rows `i >= 2`.
2.  Use `tool_code` to verify this refined hypothesis against all examples by calculating the primary non-zero digit, constructing the hypothesized base grid, tiling it, and comparing it to the expected output.
3.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the refined understanding.
