            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the output dimension increase (2N x 2N) and the horizontal/vertical duplication pattern present in Example 1. However, it failed on Examples 2 and 3, indicating the rule for generating the content being duplicated was not fully captured. Specifically, the transformation applied to rows with index `i >= 2` was incorrect.\n\nThe errors in Examples 2 and 3 reveal that the content of the duplicated block isn't simply derived by swapping the first two rows of the input and then duplicating rows horizontally. Instead, a more complex transformation is needed to create a \"base\" N x N grid first. This base grid involves:\n1.  Swapping the first two rows of the input.\n2.  For rows `i >= 2`, deriving a new row by replacing 0s with the primary non-zero digit (`P`) found in the input, and replacing occurrences of `P` with 0.\n\nThe final output is then constructed by tiling this N x N base grid in a 2x2 pattern.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Refine the perception of the transformation steps, incorporating the rule for rows `i >= 2`.\n2.  Use `tool_code` to verify this refined hypothesis against all examples by calculating the primary non-zero digit, constructing the hypothesized base grid, tiling it, and comparing it to the expected output.\n3.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the refined understanding.\n\n**Metrics and Hypothesis Verification**\n"
