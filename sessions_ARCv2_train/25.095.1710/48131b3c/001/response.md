```python
import copy # Used for deep copying the input grid to avoid modifying it

"""
Transforms an input square grid (N x N) into an output grid (2N x 2N) based on the following steps:
1. Create a modified version of the input grid: if the grid height (N) is 2 or greater, swap the first row (index 0) with the second row (index 1).
2. Construct an intermediate grid (N x 2N): Each row from the modified grid is duplicated horizontally (concatenated with itself).
3. Construct the final output grid (2N x 2N): The intermediate grid is duplicated vertically (stacked on top of itself).
