"""
Transforms an input 2D grid of integers into an output 1x1 or 2x2 grid based on frequency analysis of subgrids.

The core logic branches based on the input grid size:

1.  **If Grid <= 4x4:**
    - Find all unique non-zero 1x1 elements (numbers).
    - Count their frequencies.
    - Find the minimum frequency.
    - Select the number(s) with this minimum frequency.
    - Tie-break: Choose the largest numerical value among the tied numbers.
    - Output the selected number as a 1x1 grid.

2.  **If Grid > 4x4:**
    - Find all unique non-zero 2x2 subgrids.
    - Record each pattern, its frequency, and all its top-left occurrence coordinates.
    - **If no non-zero 2x2 subgrids exist:** Fall back to the 1x1 logic (Rule 1).
    - **If non-zero 2x2 subgrids exist:**
        - Separate patterns into two groups: those with frequency F=1 and those with F>1.
        - **If there are NO patterns with F>1 (all unique patterns appear only once):**
            - Consider all the F=1 patterns.
            - Tie-break: Select the pattern whose single occurrence is bottom-most (max row index), then right-most (max column index).
            - Output the selected 2x2 pattern.
        - **Else (at least one pattern has F>1):**
            - Consider only the patterns with F>1.
            - Find the minimum frequency among *these* patterns (F>1).
            - Select the pattern(s) with this minimum frequency.
            - Tie-break: For each tied pattern, find its *first* occurrence (top-most, then left-most). Select the pattern whose *first* occurrence is bottom-most (max row index), then left-most (min column index).
            - Output the selected 2x2 pattern.
