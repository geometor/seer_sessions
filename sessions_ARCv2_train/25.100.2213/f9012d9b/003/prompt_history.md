**Perception:**

The task involves analyzing a 2D grid of integers and extracting a smaller pattern, either a single integer (1x1) or a 2x2 grid. The core logic appears to revolve around the frequency of occurrence of subgrids (patterns) within the input grid, specifically focusing on 1x1 and 2x2 non-zero patterns. The choice between outputting a 1x1 or 2x2 pattern seems to depend on whether a unique least frequent 2x2 pattern exists, and potentially on the size of the input grid. When multiple patterns share the same frequency (either minimum or maximum depending on the condition), specific tie-breaking rules based on position or value are needed.

**Facts:**

    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers

  - action: find_frequency
    description: Determine the frequency of each unique subgrid.

    logic: involves comparison of minimum/maximum frequencies and tie-breaking rules.
  - action: apply_tie_breaking
    description: Resolve cases where multiple patterns meet the selection criteria.
    rules:
      - for minimum frequency 2x2 (F=1): select the pattern whose top-left corner occurs bottom-most, then right-most.
      - for minimum frequency 1x1: select the largest numerical value.
      - for maximum frequency 2x2 (F>1, size>4x4): select the pattern whose *first* top-left corner occurrence is bottom-most, then left-most.
relationships:
  - relationship: frequency_determines_output
    description: The frequency (minimum or maximum) of non-zero subgrids (1x1 or 2x2) is the primary factor in determining the output pattern.
  - relationship: size_determines_rule
    description: The dimensions of the input grid can influence which frequency rule (minimum vs maximum) and which pattern size (1x1 vs 2x2) is prioritized.
  - relationship: frequency_value_determines_priority
    description: A minimum frequency of 1 for 2x2 non-zero patterns takes precedence. Otherwise, grid size and other frequency comparisons dictate the logic.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all unique 2x2 subgrids within the input grid that consist solely of non-zero numbers. If no such subgrids exist, proceed directly to step 4a.
2.  Count the frequency of occurrence for each unique non-zero 2x2 subgrid found in step 1. Determine the minimum frequency (`F_min_2x2`) among these counts. Identify the pattern(s) (`P_min_2x2`) associated with this minimum frequency.
3.  If `F_min_2x2` is exactly 1:
    a.  Select the single pattern `P_min_2x2` corresponding to this frequency.
    b.  If there are multiple patterns with frequency 1 (tie), select the one whose top-left corner appears latest in the grid (scan top-to-bottom, then left-to-right; choose the last one encountered).
    c.  Output the selected 2x2 pattern.
4.  If `F_min_2x2` is greater than 1, OR if no non-zero 2x2 subgrids were found in step 1, check the input grid dimensions (Rows x Columns). If Rows <= 4 and Columns <= 4:
    a.  Identify all unique non-zero numbers (1x1 patterns) in the input grid.
    b.  Count the frequency of each unique non-zero number. Determine the minimum frequency (`F_min_1x1`) among these counts. Identify the number(s) (`P_min_1x1`) associated with this minimum frequency.
    c.  Select the number `P_min_1x1` corresponding to the minimum frequency.
    d.  If there are multiple numbers with the same minimum frequency (tie), select the largest numerical value among them.
    e.  Output the selected 1x1 number.
5.  If `F_min_2x2` is greater than 1 AND the input grid dimensions are larger than 4x4 (either Rows > 4 or Columns > 4):
    a.  Using the unique non-zero 2x2 subgrids and their frequencies calculated in steps 1 and 2, determine the maximum frequency (`F_max_2x2`) among them. Identify the pattern(s) (`P_max_2x2`) associated with this maximum frequency.
    b.  Select the pattern `P_max_2x2` corresponding to the maximum frequency.
    c.  If there are multiple patterns with the same maximum frequency (tie), compare their first occurrences in the input grid (scan top-to-bottom, left-to-right). Select the pattern whose first occurrence has the largest row index. If there's still a tie in row index, select the one with the smallest column index among those tied rows.
    d.  Output the selected 2x2 pattern.

"""
Analyzes a 2D grid of integers to extract a specific pattern (1x1 or 2x2) based on the frequency of non-zero subgrids.

The logic proceeds as follows:
1. Find all unique 2x2 subgrids consisting entirely of non-zero numbers and count their frequencies.
2. If any non-zero 2x2 subgrids exist:
   a. Find the minimum frequency (`F_min_2x2`) among them.
   b. If `F_min_2x2` is 1:
      i. Identify all patterns with frequency 1.
      ii. Apply tie-breaking: Select the pattern whose last occurrence (scanning top-to-bottom, left-to-right) is bottom-most, then right-most.
      iii. Output the selected 2x2 pattern.
   c. If `F_min_2x2` is greater than 1:
      i. Check the grid dimensions (Rows x Cols).
      ii. If Rows <= 4 and Cols <= 4: Proceed to step 3 (1x1 analysis).
      iii. If Rows > 4 or Cols > 4:
         - Find the maximum frequency (`F_max_2x2`) among the non-zero 2x2 subgrids.
         - Identify all patterns with this maximum frequency.
         - Apply tie-breaking: Select the pattern whose first occurrence (scanning top-to-bottom, left-to-right) is bottom-most, then left-most.
         - Output the selected 2x2 pattern.
3. If no non-zero 2x2 subgrids exist OR if step 2.c.ii was triggered:
   a. Find all unique non-zero numbers (1x1 patterns) in the grid and count their frequencies.
   b. Find the minimum frequency (`F_min_1x1`) among them.
   c. Identify all numbers with this minimum frequency.
   d. Apply tie-breaking: Select the largest numerical value among the tied numbers.
   e. Output the selected number as a 1x1 grid.

Output Format:
- A single number is returned as [[number]].
- A 2x2 grid is returned as [[row1_val1, row1_val2], [row2_val1, row2_val2]].

**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core task elements (grids, subgrids, frequencies) but misinterpreted the specific conditions and tie-breaking rules, particularly the interaction between grid size and frequency analysis. The code failed on Example 3 because it applied an incorrect logic branch (either the F=1 rule or the Max Frequency rule) instead of the newly discovered rule involving the minimum frequency *among patterns occurring more than once* for larger grids.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Logic:** Incorporate the grid size check (<=4x4 vs >4x4) as the primary branching condition.
2.  **Correct >4x4 Logic:** Implement the frequency analysis for grids >4x4 based on finding the minimum frequency among non-zero 2x2 patterns that appear *more than once*. If all patterns are unique (frequency=1), apply a specific tie-breaker for F=1 cases. Use the "first occurrence bottom-most, then left-most" tie-breaker for the minimum frequency (>1) patterns.
3.  **Correct <=4x4 Logic:** Maintain the logic of finding the minimum frequency 1x1 non-zero number, using the largest value as a tie-breaker.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect this refined logic.

**Example Metrics & Analysis:**

*   **Example 1 (4x4 -> 1x1):**
    *   Code Output: `[[8]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[8]]`
    *   Result: Pass.
    *   Analysis: Grid is 4x4. The logic should be: find min-frequency 1x1 non-zero numbers ({8: 6, 6: 8} -> min freq 6 for number 8). Tie-break (if any) is largest value. Selects 8. The *original* code reached this conclusion via a slightly different path (checking 2x2 min freq > 1 first), but Hypothesis 6 correctly prioritizes the size check.
*   **Example 2 (5x5 -> 2x2):**
    *   Code Output: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`
    *   Result: Pass.
    *   Analysis: Grid is 5x5 (> 4x4). Non-zero 2x2 patterns exist. All have frequency F=3 (> 1). Find min frequency among patterns with F>1 (which is 3). Patterns with F=3 are {pA, pB, pC, pD}. Tie-break using first occurrence (bottom-most, then left-most): pC `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` is selected. Hypothesis 6 logic works.
*   **Example 3 (7x7 -> 2x2):**
    *   Code Output: `[[5, 5], [2, 2]]` (Incorrect - Code used max freq rule)
    *   Expected Output: `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`
    *   Result: Fail.
    *   Analysis: Grid is 7x7 (> 4x4). Non-zero 2x2 patterns exist. Frequencies range from 1 to 6. Patterns with F>1 exist. Find min frequency among patterns with F>1. Frequencies > 1 are {6, 4, 3, 2}. Minimum is 2. Patterns with F=2 are {p5, p6, p8, p9}. Tie-break using first occurrence (bottom-most, then left-most): p8 `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` is selected. Hypothesis 6 logic works. The original code failed because its logic for F_min > 1 on large grids incorrectly used *maximum* frequency instead of the *minimum frequency among those > 1*.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the dimensions (Rows x Columns) of the input grid.
2.  **If Rows <= 4 and Columns <= 4:**
    a.  Identify all unique non-zero numbers (1x1 patterns) in the grid and count their frequencies.
    b.  Find the minimum frequency among these 1x1 patterns.
    c.  Identify all numbers having this minimum frequency.
    d.  If there is a tie (multiple numbers share the minimum frequency), select the number with the largest numerical value.
    e.  Output the selected number as a 1x1 grid.

        iii. **Else (at least one pattern has frequency greater than 1):**
            - From the filtered set (patterns with frequency > 1), find the *minimum* frequency.
            - Identify all patterns from this filtered set that have this minimum frequency.
            - Find the *first* occurrence (coordinate with min row, then min col) for each of these tied patterns.
            - Compare the *first* occurrences: Select the pattern whose first occurrence has the largest row index.
            - If there's still a tie in row index, select the pattern among the tied rows whose first occurrence has the smallest column index.
