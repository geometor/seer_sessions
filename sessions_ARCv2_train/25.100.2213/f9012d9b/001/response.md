"""
Analyzes a 2D grid of integers to extract a specific pattern (1x1 or 2x2) based on the frequency of non-zero subgrids.

The logic proceeds as follows:
1. Find all unique 2x2 subgrids consisting entirely of non-zero numbers and count their frequencies.
2. If any non-zero 2x2 subgrids exist:
   a. Find the minimum frequency (`F_min_2x2`) among them.
   b. If `F_min_2x2` is 1:
      i. Identify all patterns with frequency 1.
      ii. Apply tie-breaking: Select the pattern whose last occurrence (scanning top-to-bottom, left-to-right) is bottom-most, then right-most.
      iii. Output the selected 2x2 pattern.
   c. If `F_min_2x2` is greater than 1:
      i. Check the grid dimensions (Rows x Cols).
      ii. If Rows <= 4 and Cols <= 4: Proceed to step 3 (1x1 analysis).
      iii. If Rows > 4 or Cols > 4:
         - Find the maximum frequency (`F_max_2x2`) among the non-zero 2x2 subgrids.
         - Identify all patterns with this maximum frequency.
         - Apply tie-breaking: Select the pattern whose first occurrence (scanning top-to-bottom, left-to-right) is bottom-most, then left-most.
         - Output the selected 2x2 pattern.
3. If no non-zero 2x2 subgrids exist OR if step 2.c.ii was triggered:
   a. Find all unique non-zero numbers (1x1 patterns) in the grid and count their frequencies.
   b. Find the minimum frequency (`F_min_1x1`) among them.
   c. Identify all numbers with this minimum frequency.
   d. Apply tie-breaking: Select the largest numerical value among the tied numbers.
   e. Output the selected number as a 1x1 grid.

Output Format:
- A single number is returned as [[number]].
- A 2x2 grid is returned as [[row1_val1, row1_val2], [row2_val1, row2_val2]].
