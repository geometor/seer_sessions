            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code successfully implements the logic for the first two examples but fails on the third. A detailed trace analysis reveals that the failure occurs specifically within the tie-breaking logic for grids larger than 4x4 when multiple non-zero 2x2 patterns share the minimum frequency *among those patterns appearing more than once (F>1)*.\n\n*   **Input:** 7x7 grid (> 4x4)\n*   **Logic Branch:** Rule 2.c.ii (Patterns with F>1 exist)\n*   **Minimum Frequency (among F>1):** 2\n*   **Candidate Patterns (F=2):** `[[2,2],[5,5]]`, `[[2,5],[5,5]]`, `[[5,5],[5,2]]`, `[[5,5],[2,5]]`\n*   **Tie-breaker Rule:** Select the candidate whose *first* occurrence has the maximum row index, then the minimum column index.\n*   **First Occurrences:** (1,0), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4)\n*   **Applying Tie-breaker:**\n    *   Maximum row index is 2, corresponding to patterns `[[5,5],[5,2]]` and `[[5,5],[2,5]]`.\n    *   Minimum column index between these two (col 2 vs col 4) is 2.\n    *   **Correct Selection:** `[[5,5],[5,2]]` (Expected Output)\n*   **Code Output:** `[[5,5],[2,5]]` (Incorrect Output)\n\nThe discrepancy confirms that the Natural Language Program and the overall logic structure derived previously are likely correct for the given training examples. The issue is an implementation bug in the tie-breaking comparison within the Python code.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Reiterate the refined Natural Language Program and YAML facts, ensuring clarity, particularly around the specific tie-breaking rules.\n2.  The coder phase must focus on debugging the implementation of the `tie_break_2x2_f_gt_1` rule, ensuring the comparison logic correctly selects the pattern based on the maximum row index and then the minimum column index of the *first* occurrence.\n\n**Metrics & Analysis:**\n\n| Example | Input Size | Rule Applied     | Candidates (Freq)                    | Tie-breaker Candidates (1st Occ) | Tie-breaker Rule             | Expected Output        | Actual Output          | Match |\n| :------ | :--------- | :--------------- | :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :--------------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- | :---- |\n| 1       | 4x4        | Rule 1 (<=4x4) | {8 (6), 6 (8)} -> {8}                | N/A                              | Max Value (8)                | `[[8]]`                | `[[8]]`                | True  |\n| 2       | 5x5        | Rule 2.c.ii (>4x4, F>1) | {pA(3),pB(3),pC(3),pD(3)} -> {all} | pA(0,0),pB(0,2),pC(1,0),pD(1,2)  | Max Row, Min Col (pC)        | `[[1,1],[2,1]]`        | `[[1,1],[2,1]]`        | True  |\n| 3       | 7x7        | Rule 2.c.ii (>4x4, F>1) | {p5(2),p6(2),p8(2),p9(2)} -> {all} | p5(1,0),p6(1,4),p8(2,2),p9(2,4)  | Max Row (p8,p9), Min Col (p8) | `[[5,5],[5,2]]` (p8)   | `[[5,5],[2,5]]` (p9)   | False |\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_elements:\n  - object: input_grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array of integers\n      - dimensions: variable (Rows x Columns)\n      - values: non-negative integers, including 0\n  - object: output_pattern\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array of integers (subgrid)\n      - dimensions: 1x1 or 2x2\n      - source: extracted from input_grid based on frequency rules and grid size\n      - constraint: consists of non-zero numbers from the input\n  - object: subgrid_pattern\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array (1x1 number or 2x2 grid)\n      - constraint: must contain only non-zero numbers to be considered in frequency analysis (for 2x2) or value analysis (for 1x1)\n      - attributes:\n          - value: the number itself (for 1x1) or tuple representation (for 2x2)\n          - frequency: count of occurrences in the input grid\n          - occurrences: list of top-left coordinates (row, col) of each occurrence, sorted primarily by row, secondarily by column.\n          - first_occurrence: the coordinate pair at index 0 of the sorted 'occurrences' list.\n          - last_occurrence: the coordinate pair at the last index of the sorted 'occurrences' list.\nactions:\n  - action: check_grid_size\n    description: Determine if grid dimensions (Rows x Columns) are both <= 4 or if either is > 4.\n  - action: find_1x1_patterns\n    description: Identify unique non-zero numbers, count their frequencies.\n  - action: find_2x2_patterns\n    description: Identify unique 2x2 subgrids containing only non-zero numbers, count their frequencies, and record all occurrence coordinates (sorted).\n  - action: filter_patterns_by_frequency\n    description: Create subsets of 2x2 patterns based on frequency (e.g., frequency = 1, frequency > 1).\n  - action: find_min_frequency\n    description: Find the minimum frequency within a specified set of patterns (e.g., all 1x1, or 2x2 with F>1).\n  - action: select_candidate_patterns\n    description: Identify all patterns matching a target frequency criterion.\n  - action: apply_tie_breaking\n    description: Resolve cases where multiple patterns are candidates after frequency selection, using specific rules based on context.\n    rules:\n      - rule: tie_break_1x1\n        context: Grid <= 4x4, multiple 1x1 patterns share the minimum frequency.\n        logic: Select the pattern (number) with the largest numerical value.\n      - rule: tie_break_2x2_f_eq_1\n        context: Grid > 4x4, all identified non-zero 2x2 patterns have frequency = 1.\n        logic: Select the pattern whose single occurrence ('first_occurrence' and 'last_occurrence' are identical) has the maximum row index, breaking ties with the maximum column index.\n      - rule: tie_break_2x2_f_gt_1\n        context: Grid > 4x4, patterns with frequency > 1 exist, and multiple patterns share the minimum frequency *among those with F>1*.\n        logic: Select the pattern whose 'first_occurrence' coordinate has the maximum row index, breaking ties with the minimum column index.\nrelationships:\n  - relationship: size_determines_primary_logic\n    description: Grid size (<=4x4 vs >4x4) dictates whether the core analysis focuses on 1x1 or 2x2 patterns.\n  - relationship: frequency_filters_candidates\n    description: Frequency analysis identifies the pool of potential output patterns based on specific criteria (min freq for 1x1;

Read the input grid and determine its dimensions (Rows x Columns).\n2.  **If Rows <= 4 and Columns <= 4 (Small Grid Logic):**\n    a.  Find all unique non-zero numbers (1x1 patterns) in the grid.\n    b.  Count the frequency of each unique number.\n    c.  Determine the minimum frequency among these numbers.\n    d.  Identify all numbers that occur with this minimum frequency.\n    e.  Apply the `tie_break_1x1` rule: From the minimum-frequency numbers, select the one with the largest numerical value.\n    f.  Output the selected number as a 1x1 grid (e.g., `[[number]]`).\n3.  **Else (Rows > 4 or Columns > 4) (Large Grid Logic):**\n    a.  Find all unique 2x2 subgrids composed entirely of non-zero numbers.\n    b.  For each unique non-zero 2x2 pattern found:\n        i.  Count its total frequency of occurrence.\n        ii. Record the coordinates (row, col) of the top-left corner for every occurrence.\n        iii. Sort these occurrences first by row index (ascending), then by column index (ascending). Determine the `first_occurrence` (the first element in the sorted list) and `last_occurrence` (the last element).\n    c.  **If no non-zero 2x2 patterns were found:**\n        i.  Default to the Small Grid Logic: Execute steps 2a through 2f.\n    d.  **Else (non-zero 2x2 patterns exist):**\n        i.  Check if any of the found patterns have a frequency greater than 1.\n        ii. **If NO patterns have frequency > 1 (all frequencies are 1):**\n            - Consider all the found (F=1) patterns as candidates.\n            - Apply the `tie_break_2x2_f_eq_1` rule: Select the candidate pattern whose single occurrence has the maximum row index. If there's a tie in row index, select the one among them with the maximum column index.\n            - Output the selected 2x2 pattern.\n        iii. **Else (at least one pattern has frequency > 1):**\n            - Consider only the patterns whose frequency is greater than 1.\n            - Determine the minimum frequency among *this* group (F>1 patterns).\n            - Identify all patterns from this group that have this minimum frequency. These are the candidates.\n            - Apply the `tie_break_2x2_f_gt_1` rule: Select the candidate pattern whose `first_occurrence` has the maximum row index. If there's a tie in row index, select the one among them with the minimum column index.\n            - Output the selected 2x2 pattern."
