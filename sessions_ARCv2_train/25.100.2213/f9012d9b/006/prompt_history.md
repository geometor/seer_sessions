**Perception:**

The task involves analyzing a 2D grid of integers and extracting a smaller pattern, either a single integer (1x1) or a 2x2 grid. The core logic appears to revolve around the frequency of occurrence of subgrids (patterns) within the input grid, specifically focusing on 1x1 and 2x2 non-zero patterns. The choice between outputting a 1x1 or 2x2 pattern seems to depend on whether a unique least frequent 2x2 pattern exists, and potentially on the size of the input grid. When multiple patterns share the same frequency (either minimum or maximum depending on the condition), specific tie-breaking rules based on position or value are needed.

**Facts:**

    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers

  - action: find_frequency
    description: Determine the frequency of each unique subgrid.

    logic: involves comparison of minimum/maximum frequencies and tie-breaking rules.
  - action: apply_tie_breaking
    description: Resolve cases where multiple patterns meet the selection criteria.
    rules:
      - for minimum frequency 2x2 (F=1): select the pattern whose top-left corner occurs bottom-most, then right-most.
      - for minimum frequency 1x1: select the largest numerical value.
      - for maximum frequency 2x2 (F>1, size>4x4): select the pattern whose *first* top-left corner occurrence is bottom-most, then left-most.
relationships:
  - relationship: frequency_determines_output
    description: The frequency (minimum or maximum) of non-zero subgrids (1x1 or 2x2) is the primary factor in determining the output pattern.
  - relationship: size_determines_rule
    description: The dimensions of the input grid can influence which frequency rule (minimum vs maximum) and which pattern size (1x1 vs 2x2) is prioritized.
  - relationship: frequency_value_determines_priority
    description: A minimum frequency of 1 for 2x2 non-zero patterns takes precedence. Otherwise, grid size and other frequency comparisons dictate the logic.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all unique 2x2 subgrids within the input grid that consist solely of non-zero numbers. If no such subgrids exist, proceed directly to step 4a.
2.  Count the frequency of occurrence for each unique non-zero 2x2 subgrid found in step 1. Determine the minimum frequency (`F_min_2x2`) among these counts. Identify the pattern(s) (`P_min_2x2`) associated with this minimum frequency.
3.  If `F_min_2x2` is exactly 1:
    a.  Select the single pattern `P_min_2x2` corresponding to this frequency.
    b.  If there are multiple patterns with frequency 1 (tie), select the one whose top-left corner appears latest in the grid (scan top-to-bottom, then left-to-right; choose the last one encountered).
    c.  Output the selected 2x2 pattern.
4.  If `F_min_2x2` is greater than 1, OR if no non-zero 2x2 subgrids were found in step 1, check the input grid dimensions (Rows x Columns). If Rows <= 4 and Columns <= 4:
    a.  Identify all unique non-zero numbers (1x1 patterns) in the input grid.
    b.  Count the frequency of each unique non-zero number. Determine the minimum frequency (`F_min_1x1`) among these counts. Identify the number(s) (`P_min_1x1`) associated with this minimum frequency.
    c.  Select the number `P_min_1x1` corresponding to the minimum frequency.
    d.  If there are multiple numbers with the same minimum frequency (tie), select the largest numerical value among them.
    e.  Output the selected 1x1 number.
5.  If `F_min_2x2` is greater than 1 AND the input grid dimensions are larger than 4x4 (either Rows > 4 or Columns > 4):
    a.  Using the unique non-zero 2x2 subgrids and their frequencies calculated in steps 1 and 2, determine the maximum frequency (`F_max_2x2`) among them. Identify the pattern(s) (`P_max_2x2`) associated with this maximum frequency.
    b.  Select the pattern `P_max_2x2` corresponding to the maximum frequency.
    c.  If there are multiple patterns with the same maximum frequency (tie), compare their first occurrences in the input grid (scan top-to-bottom, left-to-right). Select the pattern whose first occurrence has the largest row index. If there's still a tie in row index, select the one with the smallest column index among those tied rows.
    d.  Output the selected 2x2 pattern.

"""
Analyzes a 2D grid of integers to extract a specific pattern (1x1 or 2x2) based on the frequency of non-zero subgrids.

The logic proceeds as follows:
1. Find all unique 2x2 subgrids consisting entirely of non-zero numbers and count their frequencies.
2. If any non-zero 2x2 subgrids exist:
   a. Find the minimum frequency (`F_min_2x2`) among them.
   b. If `F_min_2x2` is 1:
      i. Identify all patterns with frequency 1.
      ii. Apply tie-breaking: Select the pattern whose last occurrence (scanning top-to-bottom, left-to-right) is bottom-most, then right-most.
      iii. Output the selected 2x2 pattern.
   c. If `F_min_2x2` is greater than 1:
      i. Check the grid dimensions (Rows x Cols).
      ii. If Rows <= 4 and Cols <= 4: Proceed to step 3 (1x1 analysis).
      iii. If Rows > 4 or Cols > 4:
         - Find the maximum frequency (`F_max_2x2`) among the non-zero 2x2 subgrids.
         - Identify all patterns with this maximum frequency.
         - Apply tie-breaking: Select the pattern whose first occurrence (scanning top-to-bottom, left-to-right) is bottom-most, then left-most.
         - Output the selected 2x2 pattern.
3. If no non-zero 2x2 subgrids exist OR if step 2.c.ii was triggered:
   a. Find all unique non-zero numbers (1x1 patterns) in the grid and count their frequencies.
   b. Find the minimum frequency (`F_min_1x1`) among them.
   c. Identify all numbers with this minimum frequency.
   d. Apply tie-breaking: Select the largest numerical value among the tied numbers.
   e. Output the selected number as a 1x1 grid.

Output Format:
- A single number is returned as [[number]].
- A 2x2 grid is returned as [[row1_val1, row1_val2], [row2_val1, row2_val2]].

**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core task elements (grids, subgrids, frequencies) but misinterpreted the specific conditions and tie-breaking rules, particularly the interaction between grid size and frequency analysis. The code failed on Example 3 because it applied an incorrect logic branch (either the F=1 rule or the Max Frequency rule) instead of the newly discovered rule involving the minimum frequency *among patterns occurring more than once* for larger grids.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Logic:** Incorporate the grid size check (<=4x4 vs >4x4) as the primary branching condition.
2.  **Correct >4x4 Logic:** Implement the frequency analysis for grids >4x4 based on finding the minimum frequency among non-zero 2x2 patterns that appear *more than once*. If all patterns are unique (frequency=1), apply a specific tie-breaker for F=1 cases. Use the "first occurrence bottom-most, then left-most" tie-breaker for the minimum frequency (>1) patterns.
3.  **Correct <=4x4 Logic:** Maintain the logic of finding the minimum frequency 1x1 non-zero number, using the largest value as a tie-breaker.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect this refined logic.

**Example Metrics & Analysis:**

*   **Example 1 (4x4 -> 1x1):**
    *   Code Output: `[[8]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[8]]`
    *   Result: Pass.
    *   Analysis: Grid is 4x4. The logic should be: find min-frequency 1x1 non-zero numbers ({8: 6, 6: 8} -> min freq 6 for number 8). Tie-break (if any) is largest value. Selects 8. The *original* code reached this conclusion via a slightly different path (checking 2x2 min freq > 1 first), but Hypothesis 6 correctly prioritizes the size check.
*   **Example 2 (5x5 -> 2x2):**
    *   Code Output: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`
    *   Result: Pass.
    *   Analysis: Grid is 5x5 (> 4x4). Non-zero 2x2 patterns exist. All have frequency F=3 (> 1). Find min frequency among patterns with F>1 (which is 3). Patterns with F=3 are {pA, pB, pC, pD}. Tie-break using first occurrence (bottom-most, then left-most): pC `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` is selected. Hypothesis 6 logic works.
*   **Example 3 (7x7 -> 2x2):**
    *   Code Output: `[[5, 5], [2, 2]]` (Incorrect - Code used max freq rule)
    *   Expected Output: `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`
    *   Result: Fail.
    *   Analysis: Grid is 7x7 (> 4x4). Non-zero 2x2 patterns exist. Frequencies range from 1 to 6. Patterns with F>1 exist. Find min frequency among patterns with F>1. Frequencies > 1 are {6, 4, 3, 2}. Minimum is 2. Patterns with F=2 are {p5, p6, p8, p9}. Tie-break using first occurrence (bottom-most, then left-most): p8 `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` is selected. Hypothesis 6 logic works. The original code failed because its logic for F_min > 1 on large grids incorrectly used *maximum* frequency instead of the *minimum frequency among those > 1*.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the dimensions (Rows x Columns) of the input grid.
2.  **If Rows <= 4 and Columns <= 4:**
    a.  Identify all unique non-zero numbers (1x1 patterns) in the grid and count their frequencies.
    b.  Find the minimum frequency among these 1x1 patterns.
    c.  Identify all numbers having this minimum frequency.
    d.  If there is a tie (multiple numbers share the minimum frequency), select the number with the largest numerical value.
    e.  Output the selected number as a 1x1 grid.
3.  **Else (Rows > 4 or Columns > 4):**
    a.  Identify all unique 2x2 subgrids within the input grid that consist solely of non-zero numbers. Record each pattern, its frequency, and the list of its top-left corner occurrence coordinates.
    b.  **If no non-zero 2x2 subgrids exist:**
        i.  Execute steps 2a-2e (find the least frequent, largest value 1x1 number and output it).
    c.  **Else (non-zero 2x2 subgrids exist):**
        i.  Filter the identified 2x2 patterns to consider only those with a frequency greater than 1.
        ii. **If NO patterns have frequency greater than 1 (i.e., all unique non-zero 2x2 patterns appear only once):**
            - Consider all the patterns (which all have frequency 1).
            - Find the pattern whose single occurrence coordinate (row, col) has the largest row index.
            - If there's a tie in row index, select the pattern among the tied rows whose occurrence has the largest column index.
            - Output the selected 2x2 pattern.
        iii. **Else (at least one pattern has frequency greater than 1):**
            - From the filtered set (patterns with frequency > 1), find the *minimum* frequency.
            - Identify all patterns from this filtered set that have this minimum frequency.
            - Find the *first* occurrence (coordinate with min row, then min col) for each of these tied patterns.
            - Compare the *first* occurrences: Select the pattern whose first occurrence has the largest row index.
            - If there's still a tie in row index, select the pattern among the tied rows whose first occurrence has the smallest column index.

**General Assessment:**

The previous code attempt successfully solved Examples 1 and 2 but failed on Example 3. The core logic, which branches based on grid size and then analyzes frequencies (1x1 for small grids, 2x2 for large grids), seems fundamentally correct. The failure on Example 3 points specifically to an issue within the handling of the large grid ( > 4x4) scenario where multiple non-zero 2x2 patterns exist with frequencies greater than 1. The error occurred in the tie-breaking phase for selecting among the patterns that share the *minimum* frequency *among those with frequency greater than 1*.

Manual re-tracing of the logic for Example 3 suggests the described Natural Language Program (NLP) correctly identifies the target pattern (`[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`). However, the code produced a different pattern (`[[5, 5], [2, 5]]`) which also shares the same minimum frequency (F=2) but loses the tie-breaker according to the rules (max row, then min col for the *first* occurrence). This discrepancy indicates either a subtle flaw in the code's implementation of the tie-breaker or pattern/occurrence identification, or a misunderstanding in the manual analysis.

**Strategy:**

1.  Maintain the current high-level logic structure (size check first, then frequency analysis).
2.  Refine the description of the tie-breaking rules in the NLP and YAML facts for maximum clarity, ensuring the distinction between the F=1 tie-breaker and the F>1 tie-breaker for large grids is explicit.
3.  Re-verify the exact details of pattern identification, frequency counting, and occurrence tracking for Example 3 to ensure the NLP accurately reflects the process needed.
4.  Emphasize in the documentation (NLP and facts) the specific criteria for each tie-breaker (value for 1x1; last occurrence position for 2x2 F=1; first occurrence position for 2x2 F>1).
5.  The coder phase will need to meticulously debug the implementation of the F>1 tie-breaking logic for large grids.

**Example Metrics & Analysis:**

*   **Example 1 (4x4 -> 1x1):**
    *   Code Output: `[[8]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[8]]`
    *   Result: Pass.
    *   Analysis: Grid is 4x4. Logic: Find min-frequency 1x1 non-zero numbers ({8: 6, 6: 8} -> min freq 6). Candidate: {8}. Output: `[[8]]`. Consistent with NLP.
*   **Example 2 (5x5 -> 2x2):**
    *   Code Output: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`
    *   Result: Pass.
    *   Analysis: Grid is 5x5 (> 4x4). Non-zero 2x2 patterns exist. All have frequency F=3 (> 1). Min frequency among F>1 patterns is 3. Candidates: {`[[2,1],[1,1]]`, `[[1,2],[1,1]]`, `[[1,1],[2,1]]`, `[[1,1],[1,2]]`}. Tie-break using first occurrence (max row, then min col):
        *   `[[2,1],[1,1]]` first occ: (0,0)
        *   `[[1,2],[1,1]]` first occ: (0,2)
        *   `[[1,1],[2,1]]` first occ: (1,0) => pC
        *   `[[1,1],[1,2]]` first occ: (1,2)
        Max row is 1 (pC, last pattern). Min col among row 1 is 0 (pC). Select pC `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`. Consistent with NLP.
*   **Example 3 (7x7 -> 2x2):**
    *   Code Output: `[[5, 5], [2, 5]]` (Incorrect)
    *   Expected Output: `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`
    *   Result: Fail.
    *   Analysis: Grid is 7x7 (> 4x4). Non-zero 2x2 patterns exist. Frequencies > 1 exist {6, 4, 3, 2}. Minimum frequency among F>1 is 2. Candidates with F=2: {`[[2,2],[5,5]]`(p5), `[[2,5],[5,5]]`(p6), `[[5,5],[5,2]]`(p8), `[[5,5],[2,5]]`(p9)}. Tie-break using first occurrence (max row, then min col):
        *   p5 first occ: (1, 0)
        *   p6 first occ: (1, 4)
        *   p8 first occ: (2, 2)
        *   p9 first occ: (2, 4)
        Max row is 2 (p8, p9). Min col among row 2 is 2 (p8). Select p8 `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`. The NLP dictates p8, but the code produced p9.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the dimensions (Rows x Columns) of the input grid.
2.  **If Rows <= 4 and Columns <= 4:**
    a.  Identify all unique non-zero numbers (1x1 patterns) present in the grid.
    b.  Count the frequency of each unique number.
    c.  Find the minimum frequency among these counts.
    d.  Identify all numbers that occur with this minimum frequency.
    e.  From these minimum-frequency numbers, select the one with the largest numerical value (apply `tie_break_1x1`).
    f.  Output the selected number as a 1x1 grid.
3.  **Else (Rows > 4 or Columns > 4):**
    a.  Identify all unique 2x2 subgrids within the input grid that consist solely of non-zero numbers.
    b.  For each unique non-zero 2x2 pattern, count its frequency and record the coordinates (row, col) of the top-left corner of all its occurrences. Determine its `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence`.
    c.  **If no non-zero 2x2 subgrids were found:**
        i.  Execute steps 2a-2f (find the least frequent, largest value 1x1 number and output it).
    d.  **Else (non-zero 2x2 subgrids exist):**
        i.  Separate the found patterns into two groups: those with frequency = 1 (`patterns_f1`) and those with frequency > 1 (`patterns_f_gt1`).
        ii. **If the `patterns_f_gt1` group is empty (all found patterns have frequency 1):**
            - Consider all patterns in `patterns_f1`.
            - Select the pattern whose single occurrence has the maximum row index, breaking ties with the maximum column index (apply `tie_break_2x2_f_eq_1`).
            - Output the selected 2x2 pattern.
        iii. **Else (at least one pattern has frequency > 1):**
            - Consider only the patterns in the `patterns_f_gt1` group.
            - Find the minimum frequency present within this group.
            - Identify all patterns in `patterns_f_gt1` that have this minimum frequency. These are the candidate patterns.
            - From these candidate patterns, select the one whose `first_occurrence` has the maximum row index, breaking ties with the minimum column index (apply `tie_break_2x2_f_gt_1`).
            - Output the selected 2x2 pattern.
