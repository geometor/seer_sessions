            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code attempt successfully solved Examples 1 and 2 but failed on Example 3. The core logic, which branches based on grid size and then analyzes frequencies (1x1 for small grids, 2x2 for large grids), seems fundamentally correct. The failure on Example 3 points specifically to an issue within the handling of the large grid ( > 4x4) scenario where multiple non-zero 2x2 patterns exist with frequencies greater than 1. The error occurred in the tie-breaking phase for selecting among the patterns that share the *minimum* frequency *among those with frequency greater than 1*.\n\nManual re-tracing of the logic for Example 3 suggests the described Natural Language Program (NLP) correctly identifies the target pattern (`[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`). However, the code produced a different pattern (`[[5, 5], [2, 5]]`) which also shares the same minimum frequency (F=2) but loses the tie-breaker according to the rules (max row, then min col for the *first* occurrence). This discrepancy indicates either a subtle flaw in the code's implementation of the tie-breaker or pattern/occurrence identification, or a misunderstanding in the manual analysis.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Maintain the current high-level logic structure (size check first, then frequency analysis).\n2.  Refine the description of the tie-breaking rules in the NLP and YAML facts for maximum clarity, ensuring the distinction between the F=1 tie-breaker and the F>1 tie-breaker for large grids is explicit.\n3.  Re-verify the exact details of pattern identification, frequency counting, and occurrence tracking for Example 3 to ensure the NLP accurately reflects the process needed.\n4.  Emphasize in the documentation (NLP and facts) the specific criteria for each tie-breaker (value for 1x1; last occurrence position for 2x2 F=1; first occurrence position for 2x2 F>1).\n5.  The coder phase will need to meticulously debug the implementation of the F>1 tie-breaking logic for large grids.\n\n**Example Metrics & Analysis:**\n\n*   **Example 1 (4x4 -> 1x1):**\n    *   Code Output: `[[8]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[8]]`\n    *   Result: Pass.\n    *   Analysis: Grid is 4x4. Logic: Find min-frequency 1x1 non-zero numbers ({8: 6, 6: 8} -> min freq 6). Candidate: {8}. Output: `[[8]]`. Consistent with NLP.\n*   **Example 2 (5x5 -> 2x2):**\n    *   Code Output: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`\n    *   Result: Pass.\n    *   Analysis: Grid is 5x5 (> 4x4). Non-zero 2x2 patterns exist. All have frequency F=3 (> 1). Min frequency among F>1 patterns is 3. Candidates: {`[[2,1],[1,1]]`, `[[1,2],[1,1]]`, `[[1,1],[2,1]]`, `[[1,1],[1,2]]`}. Tie-break using first occurrence (max row, then min col):\n        *   `[[2,1],[1,1]]` first occ: (0,0)\n        *   `[[1,2],[1,1]]` first occ: (0,2)\n        *   `[[1,1],[2,1]]` first occ: (1,0) => pC\n        *   `[[1,1],[1,2]]` first occ: (1,2)\n        Max row is 1 (pC, last pattern). Min col among row 1 is 0 (pC). Select pC `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`. Consistent with NLP.\n*   **Example 3 (7x7 -> 2x2):**\n    *   Code Output: `[[5, 5], [2, 5]]` (Incorrect)\n    *   Expected Output: `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`\n    *   Result: Fail.\n    *   Analysis: Grid is 7x7 (> 4x4). Non-zero 2x2 patterns exist. Frequencies > 1 exist {6, 4, 3, 2}. Minimum frequency among F>1 is 2. Candidates with F=2: {`[[2,2],[5,5]]`(p5), `[[2,5],[5,5]]`(p6), `[[5,5],[5,2]]`(p8), `[[5,5],[2,5]]`(p9)}. Tie-break using first occurrence (max row, then min col):\n        *   p5 first occ: (1, 0)\n        *   p6 first occ: (1, 4)\n        *   p8 first occ: (2, 2)\n        *   p9 first occ: (2, 4)\n        Max row is 2 (p8, p9). Min col among row 2 is 2 (p8). Select p8 `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`. The NLP dictates p8, but the code produced p9.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_elements:\n  - object: input_grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array of integers\n      - dimensions: variable (Rows x Columns)\n      - values: non-negative integers, including 0\n  - object: output_pattern\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array of integers (subgrid)\n      - dimensions: 1x1 or 2x2\n      - source: extracted from input_grid based on frequency rules and grid size\n      - constraint: consists of non-zero numbers from the input\n  - object: subgrid_pattern\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array (1x1 number or 2x2 grid)\n      - constraint: must contain only non-zero numbers to be considered in frequency analysis\n      - attributes:\n          - value: the number itself (for 1x1) or tuple representation (for 2x2)\n          - frequency: count of occurrences in the input grid\n          - occurrences: list of top-left coordinates (row, col) of each occurrence\n          - first_occurrence: the coordinate pair in 'occurrences' with the minimum row index, breaking ties with the minimum column index.\n          - last_occurrence: the coordinate pair in 'occurrences' with the maximum row index, breaking ties with the maximum column index.\nactions:\n  - action: check_grid_size\n    description: Determine if grid dimensions (Rows x Columns) are both <= 4 or if either is > 4.\n  - action: find_1x1_patterns\n    description: Identify unique non-zero numbers, count their frequencies.\n  - action: find_2x2_patterns\n    description: Identify unique 2x2 subgrids containing only non-zero numbers, count their frequencies, and record all occurrence coordinates.\n  - action: filter_patterns_by_frequency\n    description: Create subsets of patterns based on frequency (e.g., frequency = 1, frequency > 1).\n  - action: find_min_frequency\n    description: Find the minimum frequency within a specified set of patterns (e.g., all 1x1, or 2x2 with F>1).\n  - action: select_candidate_patterns\n    description: Identify all patterns matching a target frequency.\n  - action: apply_tie_breaking\n    description: Resolve cases where multiple patterns are candidates after frequency selection.\n    rules:\n      - rule: tie_break_1x1\n        condition: Applied when grid <= 4x4 and multiple 1x1 patterns share the minimum frequency.\n        logic: Select the pattern (number) with the largest numerical value.\n      - rule: tie_break_2x2_f_eq_1\n        condition: Applied when grid > 4x4 and all non-zero 2x2 patterns have frequency 1.\n        logic: Select the pattern whose single occurrence ('last_occurrence' is the same as 'first_occurrence' here) has the maximum row index, breaking ties with the maximum column index.\n      - rule: tie_break_2x2_f_gt_1\n        condition: Applied when grid > 4x4, patterns with frequency > 1 exist, and multiple patterns share the minimum frequency *among those with F>1*.\n        logic: Select the pattern whose 'first_occurrence' has the maximum row index, breaking ties with the minimum column index.\nrelationships:\n  - relationship: size_determines_primary_logic\n    description: Grid size (<=4x4 vs >4x4) dictates whether to focus on 1x1 or 2x2 patterns.\n  - relationship: frequency_filters_candidates\n    description: Frequency analysis (minimum overall for 1x1, minimum among F>1 for 2x2, or handling F=1 cases for 2x2) determines the initial set of candidate patterns.\n  - relationship: tie_breaking_selects_final\n    description: Specific tie-breaking rules based on value (1x1) or occurrence position (2x2, differing rules for F=1 vs F>1 scenarios) resolve ambiguity to select the single output pattern.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Determine the dimensions (Rows x Columns) of the input grid.\n2.  **If Rows <= 4 and Columns <= 4:**\n    a.  Identify all unique non-zero numbers (1x1 patterns) present in the grid.\n    b.  Count the frequency of each unique number.\n    c.  Find the minimum frequency among these counts.\n    d.  Identify all numbers that occur with this minimum frequency.\n    e.  From these minimum-frequency numbers, select the one with the largest numerical value (apply `tie_break_1x1`).\n    f.  Output the selected number as a 1x1 grid.\n3.  **Else (Rows > 4 or Columns > 4):**\n    a.  Identify all unique 2x2 subgrids within the input grid that consist solely of non-zero numbers.\n    b.
