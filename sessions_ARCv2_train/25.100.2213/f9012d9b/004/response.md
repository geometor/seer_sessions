**General Assessment:**

The previous code attempt successfully solved Examples 1 and 2 but failed on Example 3. The core logic, which branches based on grid size and then analyzes frequencies (1x1 for small grids, 2x2 for large grids), seems fundamentally correct. The failure on Example 3 points specifically to an issue within the handling of the large grid ( > 4x4) scenario where multiple non-zero 2x2 patterns exist with frequencies greater than 1. The error occurred in the tie-breaking phase for selecting among the patterns that share the *minimum* frequency *among those with frequency greater than 1*.

Manual re-tracing of the logic for Example 3 suggests the described Natural Language Program (NLP) correctly identifies the target pattern (`[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`). However, the code produced a different pattern (`[[5, 5], [2, 5]]`) which also shares the same minimum frequency (F=2) but loses the tie-breaker according to the rules (max row, then min col for the *first* occurrence). This discrepancy indicates either a subtle flaw in the code's implementation of the tie-breaker or pattern/occurrence identification, or a misunderstanding in the manual analysis.

**Strategy:**

1.  Maintain the current high-level logic structure (size check first, then frequency analysis).
2.  Refine the description of the tie-breaking rules in the NLP and YAML facts for maximum clarity, ensuring the distinction between the F=1 tie-breaker and the F>1 tie-breaker for large grids is explicit.
3.  Re-verify the exact details of pattern identification, frequency counting, and occurrence tracking for Example 3 to ensure the NLP accurately reflects the process needed.
4.  Emphasize in the documentation (NLP and facts) the specific criteria for each tie-breaker (value for 1x1; last occurrence position for 2x2 F=1; first occurrence position for 2x2 F>1).
5.  The coder phase will need to meticulously debug the implementation of the F>1 tie-breaking logic for large grids.

**Example Metrics & Analysis:**

*   **Example 1 (4x4 -> 1x1):**
    *   Code Output: `[[8]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[8]]`
    *   Result: Pass.
    *   Analysis: Grid is 4x4. Logic: Find min-frequency 1x1 non-zero numbers ({8: 6, 6: 8} -> min freq 6). Candidate: {8}. Output: `[[8]]`. Consistent with NLP.
*   **Example 2 (5x5 -> 2x2):**
    *   Code Output: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`
    *   Result: Pass.
    *   Analysis: Grid is 5x5 (> 4x4). Non-zero 2x2 patterns exist. All have frequency F=3 (> 1). Min frequency among F>1 patterns is 3. Candidates: {`[[2,1],[1,1]]`, `[[1,2],[1,1]]`, `[[1,1],[2,1]]`, `[[1,1],[1,2]]`}. Tie-break using first occurrence (max row, then min col):
        *   `[[2,1],[1,1]]` first occ: (0,0)
        *   `[[1,2],[1,1]]` first occ: (0,2)
        *   `[[1,1],[2,1]]` first occ: (1,0) => pC
        *   `[[1,1],[1,2]]` first occ: (1,2)
        Max row is 1 (pC, last pattern). Min col among row 1 is 0 (pC). Select pC `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`. Consistent with NLP.
*   **Example 3 (7x7 -> 2x2):**
    *   Code Output: `[[5, 5], [2, 5]]` (Incorrect)
    *   Expected Output: `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`
    *   Result: Fail.
    *   Analysis: Grid is 7x7 (> 4x4). Non-zero 2x2 patterns exist. Frequencies > 1 exist {6, 4, 3, 2}. Minimum frequency among F>1 is 2. Candidates with F=2: {`[[2,2],[5,5]]`(p5), `[[2,5],[5,5]]`(p6), `[[5,5],[5,2]]`(p8), `[[5,5],[2,5]]`(p9)}. Tie-break using first occurrence (max row, then min col):
        *   p5 first occ: (1, 0)
        *   p6 first occ: (1, 4)
        *   p8 first occ: (2, 2)
        *   p9 first occ: (2, 4)
        Max row is 2 (p8, p9). Min col among row 2 is 2 (p8). Select p8 `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`. The NLP dictates p8, but the code produced p9.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the dimensions (Rows x Columns) of the input grid.
2.  **If Rows <= 4 and Columns <= 4:**
    a.  Identify all unique non-zero numbers (1x1 patterns) present in the grid.
    b.  Count the frequency of each unique number.
    c.  Find the minimum frequency among these counts.
    d.  Identify all numbers that occur with this minimum frequency.
    e.  From these minimum-frequency numbers, select the one with the largest numerical value (apply `tie_break_1x1`).
    f.  Output the selected number as a 1x1 grid.
3.  **Else (Rows > 4 or Columns > 4):**
    a.  Identify all unique 2x2 subgrids within the input grid that consist solely of non-zero numbers.
    b.  For each unique non-zero 2x2 pattern, count its frequency and record the coordinates (row, col) of the top-left corner of all its occurrences. Determine its `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence`.
    c.  **If no non-zero 2x2 subgrids were found:**
        i.  Execute steps 2a-2f (find the least frequent, largest value 1x1 number and output it).
    d.  **Else (non-zero 2x2 subgrids exist):**
        i.  Separate the found patterns into two groups: those with frequency = 1 (`patterns_f1`) and those with frequency > 1 (`patterns_f_gt1`).
        ii. **If the `patterns_f_gt1` group is empty (all found patterns have frequency 1):**
            - Consider all patterns in `patterns_f1`.
            - Select the pattern whose single occurrence has the maximum row index, breaking ties with the maximum column index (apply `tie_break_2x2_f_eq_1`).
            - Output the selected 2x2 pattern.
        iii. **Else (at least one pattern has frequency > 1):**
            - Consider only the patterns in the `patterns_f_gt1` group.
            - Find the minimum frequency present within this group.
            - Identify all patterns in `patterns_f_gt1` that have this minimum frequency. These are the candidate patterns.
            - From these candidate patterns, select the one whose `first_occurrence` has the maximum row index, breaking ties with the minimum column index (apply `tie_break_2x2_f_gt_1`).
            - Output the selected 2x2 pattern.
