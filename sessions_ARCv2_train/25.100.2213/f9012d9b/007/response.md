"""
Transforms an input 2D grid of integers into an output 1x1 or 2x2 grid based on frequency analysis and grid size.

Rule Summary:
1.  If Grid <= 4x4: Find the least frequent non-zero 1x1 number. Tie-break using the largest numerical value. Output as 1x1.
2.  If Grid > 4x4:
    a. Find all unique non-zero 2x2 patterns, their frequencies, and occurrence locations (top-left coordinates).
    b. If no such patterns exist, fall back to Rule 1 (1x1 logic).
    c. If patterns exist:
        i. If *all* patterns have frequency 1: Select the pattern whose single occurrence is bottom-most (max row), then right-most (max col). Output as 2x2.
        ii. If *some* patterns have frequency > 1: Consider only patterns with frequency > 1. Find the *minimum* frequency among these. Select the pattern(s) with this minimum frequency. Tie-break using the *first* occurrence (top-most row, then left-most col): select the pattern whose *first* occurrence is bottom-most (max row), then left-most (min col). Output as 2x2.
