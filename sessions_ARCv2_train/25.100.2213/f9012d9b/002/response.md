**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core task elements (grids, subgrids, frequencies) but misinterpreted the specific conditions and tie-breaking rules, particularly the interaction between grid size and frequency analysis. The code failed on Example 3 because it applied an incorrect logic branch (either the F=1 rule or the Max Frequency rule) instead of the newly discovered rule involving the minimum frequency *among patterns occurring more than once* for larger grids.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Logic:** Incorporate the grid size check (<=4x4 vs >4x4) as the primary branching condition.
2.  **Correct >4x4 Logic:** Implement the frequency analysis for grids >4x4 based on finding the minimum frequency among non-zero 2x2 patterns that appear *more than once*. If all patterns are unique (frequency=1), apply a specific tie-breaker for F=1 cases. Use the "first occurrence bottom-most, then left-most" tie-breaker for the minimum frequency (>1) patterns.
3.  **Correct <=4x4 Logic:** Maintain the logic of finding the minimum frequency 1x1 non-zero number, using the largest value as a tie-breaker.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect this refined logic.

**Example Metrics & Analysis:**

*   **Example 1 (4x4 -> 1x1):**
    *   Code Output: `[[8]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[8]]`
    *   Result: Pass.
    *   Analysis: Grid is 4x4. The logic should be: find min-frequency 1x1 non-zero numbers ({8: 6, 6: 8} -> min freq 6 for number 8). Tie-break (if any) is largest value. Selects 8. The *original* code reached this conclusion via a slightly different path (checking 2x2 min freq > 1 first), but Hypothesis 6 correctly prioritizes the size check.
*   **Example 2 (5x5 -> 2x2):**
    *   Code Output: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`
    *   Result: Pass.
    *   Analysis: Grid is 5x5 (> 4x4). Non-zero 2x2 patterns exist. All have frequency F=3 (> 1). Find min frequency among patterns with F>1 (which is 3). Patterns with F=3 are {pA, pB, pC, pD}. Tie-break using first occurrence (bottom-most, then left-most): pC `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` is selected. Hypothesis 6 logic works.
*   **Example 3 (7x7 -> 2x2):**
    *   Code Output: `[[5, 5], [2, 2]]` (Incorrect - Code used max freq rule)
    *   Expected Output: `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`
    *   Result: Fail.
    *   Analysis: Grid is 7x7 (> 4x4). Non-zero 2x2 patterns exist. Frequencies range from 1 to 6. Patterns with F>1 exist. Find min frequency among patterns with F>1. Frequencies > 1 are {6, 4, 3, 2}. Minimum is 2. Patterns with F=2 are {p5, p6, p8, p9}. Tie-break using first occurrence (bottom-most, then left-most): p8 `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` is selected. Hypothesis 6 logic works. The original code failed because its logic for F_min > 1 on large grids incorrectly used *maximum* frequency instead of the *minimum frequency among those > 1*.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the dimensions (Rows x Columns) of the input grid.
2.  **If Rows <= 4 and Columns <= 4:**
    a.  Identify all unique non-zero numbers (1x1 patterns) in the grid and count their frequencies.
    b.  Find the minimum frequency among these 1x1 patterns.
    c.  Identify all numbers having this minimum frequency.

            - Identify all patterns from this filtered set that have this minimum frequency.
            - Find the *first* occurrence (coordinate with min row, then min col) for each of these tied patterns.
            - Compare the *first* occurrences: Select the pattern whose first occurrence has the largest row index.
            - If there's still a tie in row index, select the pattern among the tied rows whose first occurrence has the smallest column index.
            - Output the selected 2x2 pattern.
