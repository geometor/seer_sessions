task_elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: variable (Rows x Columns)
      - values: non-negative integers, including 0
  - object: output_pattern
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (subgrid)
      - dimensions: 1x1 or 2x2
      - source: extracted from input_grid based on frequency rules
      - constraint: consists of non-zero numbers from the input
  - object: subgrid_pattern
    properties:
      - type: 2D array (1x1 or 2x2)
      - constraint: must contain only non-zero numbers to be considered in frequency analysis
      - attributes:
          - frequency: count of occurrences in the input grid
          - occurrences: list of top-left coordinates (row, col)
          - first_occurrence: the occurrence with the smallest row index, then smallest col index
          - last_occurrence: the occurrence with the largest row index, then largest col index
actions:
  - action: check_grid_size
    description: Determine if grid dimensions are <= 4x4 or > 4x4.
  - action: find_1x1_patterns
    description: Identify unique non-zero numbers and their frequencies.
  - action: find_2x2_patterns
    description: Identify unique non-zero 2x2 subgrids, their frequencies, and occurrence locations.
  - action: filter_frequencies
    description: Select a subset of patterns based on frequency criteria (e.g., > 1).
  - action: find_min_frequency
    description: Find the minimum frequency within a set of patterns (1x1 or 2x2).
  - action: select_pattern_set
    description: Identify all patterns matching a specific frequency.
  - action: apply_tie_breaking
    description: Resolve cases where multiple patterns meet the selection criteria.
    rules:
      - rule_1x1_min_freq: Select the pattern (number) with the largest numerical value.
      - rule_2x2_f_gt_1: From the set of patterns tied for the target frequency, select the one whose *first* occurrence is bottom-most (max row), then left-most (min col).
      - rule_2x2_f_eq_1: From the set of patterns tied for frequency 1, select the one whose *single* occurrence is bottom-most (max row), then right-most (max col).
relationships:
  - relationship: size_determines_pattern_type
    description: Grid size (<=4x4 vs >4x4) is the primary factor determining whether to output a 1x1 or 2x2 pattern.
  - relationship: frequency_determines_selection
    description: Frequency analysis (min freq for 1x1, min freq > 1 for 2x2, or F=1 rule for 2x2) guides pattern selection within the size-determined category.
  - relationship: tie_breaking_resolves_ambiguity
    description: Specific tie-breaking rules based on value or occurrence position are used when multiple patterns satisfy frequency criteria.
