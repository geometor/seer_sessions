            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core task elements (grids, subgrids, frequencies) but misinterpreted the specific conditions and tie-breaking rules, particularly the interaction between grid size and frequency analysis. The code failed on Example 3 because it applied an incorrect logic branch (either the F=1 rule or the Max Frequency rule) instead of the newly discovered rule involving the minimum frequency *among patterns occurring more than once* for larger grids.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Logic:** Incorporate the grid size check (<=4x4 vs >4x4) as the primary branching condition.\n2.  **Correct >4x4 Logic:** Implement the frequency analysis for grids >4x4 based on finding the minimum frequency among non-zero 2x2 patterns that appear *more than once*. If all patterns are unique (frequency=1), apply a specific tie-breaker for F=1 cases. Use the \"first occurrence bottom-most, then left-most\" tie-breaker for the minimum frequency (>1) patterns.\n3.  **Correct <=4x4 Logic:** Maintain the logic of finding the minimum frequency 1x1 non-zero number, using the largest value as a tie-breaker.\n4.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect this refined logic.\n\n**Example Metrics & Analysis:**\n\n*   **Example 1 (4x4 -> 1x1):**\n    *   Code Output: `[[8]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[8]]`\n    *   Result: Pass.\n    *   Analysis: Grid is 4x4. The logic should be: find min-frequency 1x1 non-zero numbers ({8: 6, 6: 8} -> min freq 6 for number 8). Tie-break (if any) is largest value. Selects 8. The *original* code reached this conclusion via a slightly different path (checking 2x2 min freq > 1 first), but Hypothesis 6 correctly prioritizes the size check.\n*   **Example 2 (5x5 -> 2x2):**\n    *   Code Output: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`\n    *   Result: Pass.\n    *   Analysis: Grid is 5x5 (> 4x4). Non-zero 2x2 patterns exist. All have frequency F=3 (> 1). Find min frequency among patterns with F>1 (which is 3). Patterns with F=3 are {pA, pB, pC, pD}. Tie-break using first occurrence (bottom-most, then left-most): pC `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` is selected. Hypothesis 6 logic works.\n*   **Example 3 (7x7 -> 2x2):**\n    *   Code Output: `[[5, 5], [2, 2]]` (Incorrect - Code used max freq rule)\n    *   Expected Output: `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`\n    *   Result: Fail.\n    *   Analysis: Grid is 7x7 (> 4x4). Non-zero 2x2 patterns exist. Frequencies range from 1 to 6. Patterns with F>1 exist. Find min frequency among patterns with F>1. Frequencies > 1 are {6, 4, 3, 2}. Minimum is 2. Patterns with F=2 are {p5, p6, p8, p9}. Tie-break using first occurrence (bottom-most, then left-most): p8 `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` is selected. Hypothesis 6 logic works. The original code failed because its logic for F_min > 1 on large grids incorrectly used *maximum* frequency instead of the *minimum frequency among those > 1*.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_elements:\n  - object: input_grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array of integers\n      - dimensions: variable (Rows x Columns)\n      - values: non-negative integers, including 0\n  - object: output_pattern\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array of integers (subgrid)\n      - dimensions: 1x1 or 2x2\n      - source: extracted from input_grid based on frequency rules\n      - constraint: consists of non-zero numbers from the input\n  - object: subgrid_pattern\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array (1x1 or 2x2)\n      - constraint: must contain only non-zero numbers to be considered in frequency analysis\n      - attributes:\n          - frequency: count of occurrences in the input grid\n          - occurrences: list of top-left coordinates (row, col)\n          - first_occurrence: the occurrence with the smallest row index, then smallest col index\n          - last_occurrence: the occurrence with the largest row index, then largest col index\nactions:\n  - action: check_grid_size\n    description: Determine if grid dimensions are <= 4x4 or > 4x4.\n  - action: find_1x1_patterns\n    description: Identify unique non-zero numbers and their frequencies.\n  - action: find_2x2_patterns\n    description: Identify unique non-zero 2x2 subgrids, their frequencies, and occurrence locations.\n  - action: filter_frequencies\n    description: Select a subset of patterns based on frequency criteria (e.g., > 1).\n  - action: find_min_frequency\n    description: Find the minimum frequency within a set of patterns (1x1 or 2x2).\n  - action: select_pattern_set\n    description: Identify all patterns matching a specific frequency.\n  - action: apply_tie_breaking\n    description: Resolve cases where multiple patterns meet the selection criteria.\n    rules:\n      - rule_1x1_min_freq: Select the pattern (number) with the largest numerical value.\n      - rule_2x2_f_gt_1: From the set of patterns tied for the target frequency, select the one whose *first* occurrence is bottom-most (max row), then left-most (min col).\n      - rule_2x2_f_eq_1: From the set of patterns tied for frequency 1, select the one whose *single* occurrence is bottom-most (max row), then right-most (max col).\nrelationships:\n  - relationship: size_determines_pattern_type\n    description: Grid size (<=4x4 vs >4x4) is the primary factor determining whether to output a 1x1 or 2x2 pattern.\n  - relationship: frequency_determines_selection\n    description: Frequency analysis (min freq for 1x1, min freq > 1 for 2x2, or F=1 rule for 2x2) guides pattern selection within the size-determined category.\n  - relationship: tie_breaking_resolves_ambiguity\n    description: Specific tie-breaking rules based on value or occurrence position are used when multiple patterns satisfy frequency criteria.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.
