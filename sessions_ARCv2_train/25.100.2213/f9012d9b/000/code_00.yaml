task_elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 4x4, 5x5, 7x7)
      - values: non-negative integers, including 0
  - object: output_pattern
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (subgrid) or single integer
      - dimensions: 1x1 or 2x2
      - source: extracted or derived from input_grid
      - constraint: appears to consist of non-zero numbers from the input
actions:
  - action: analyze_subgrids
    description: Identify and count occurrences of subgrids within the input grid.
    parameters:
      - size: 1x1 or 2x2
      - constraint: consider only subgrids composed entirely of non-zero numbers
  - action: find_frequency
    description: Determine the frequency of each unique subgrid.
  - action: find_minimum_frequency
    description: Identify the minimum frequency among specified subgrids (e.g., non-zero 1x1, non-zero 2x2).
  - action: find_maximum_frequency
    description: Identify the maximum frequency among specified subgrids (e.g., non-zero 2x2).
  - action: select_pattern
    description: Choose the output pattern based on frequency analysis and grid size.
    logic: involves comparison of minimum/maximum frequencies and tie-breaking rules.
  - action: apply_tie_breaking
    description: Resolve cases where multiple patterns meet the selection criteria.
    rules:
      - for minimum frequency 2x2 (F=1): select the pattern whose top-left corner occurs bottom-most, then right-most.
      - for minimum frequency 1x1: select the largest numerical value.
      - for maximum frequency 2x2 (F>1, size>4x4): select the pattern whose *first* top-left corner occurrence is bottom-most, then left-most.
relationships:
  - relationship: frequency_determines_output
    description: The frequency (minimum or maximum) of non-zero subgrids (1x1 or 2x2) is the primary factor in determining the output pattern.
  - relationship: size_determines_rule
    description: The dimensions of the input grid can influence which frequency rule (minimum vs maximum) and which pattern size (1x1 vs 2x2) is prioritized.
  - relationship: frequency_value_determines_priority
    description: A minimum frequency of 1 for 2x2 non-zero patterns takes precedence. Otherwise, grid size and other frequency comparisons dictate the logic.
