task_elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - cell_type: single digit (0-9)
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - location: (row, column) coordinates (0-based index)
      - value: digit (0-9)
  - object: central_cross
    definition: Cells where row index is 2 OR column index is 2.
    properties:
      - invariant: Cells in the central cross retain their input value (always 7 in examples).
  - object: candidate_cell
    definition: A cell containing the value 7 AND not located in the central_cross.
    properties:
      - subject_to_change: These are the only cells whose values might change.
  - relationship: neighbors
    definition: Cells directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a given cell within grid boundaries.
    role: Influence the output value of candidate_cells.
  - action: transform
    description: Modifies the input grid to produce the output grid based on cell values and locations.
    rule_components:
      - invariance: Cells in the central_cross and cells not containing 7 remain unchanged.
      - modification: Candidate_cells (value 7, outside central_cross) have their value replaced.
      - replacement_logic: The new value seems primarily determined by the values of the input neighbors, likely involving the minimum non-7 neighbor, although the exact rule is not fully resolved by the examples.
