Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 5x5 grids containing single digits (0-9).
2.  **Core Object:** The central element seems to be the digit '7'.
3.  **Invariant Structure:** A central "cross" pattern formed by row index 2 and column index 2 appears invariant across all examples. All cells within this cross (row 2 or column 2) contain the digit 7 in the input and remain 7 in the output.
4.  **Conditional Change:** Changes only occur at cells that contain the digit 7 in the input AND are *not* part of the central invariant cross (i.e., neither row index nor column index is 2).
5.  **Change Mechanism:** For the input 7s located outside the central cross, their value is replaced in the output. The new value appears related to the values of their direct (up, down, left, right - Von Neumann) neighbors in the input grid.
6.  **Neighbor Influence:** The most likely rule involves finding the minimum value among the direct neighbors, potentially excluding neighbors that are also 7. However, applying this rule ("minimum non-7 neighbor") directly doesn't perfectly match all transformations, suggesting a more complex condition or a different rule entirely might be at play, although it matches in some cases (e.g., train_3, cell (3,1)). Other cells that are not 7 remain unchanged.

## Facts

```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - cell_type: single digit (0-9)
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - location: (row, column) coordinates (0-based index)
      - value: digit (0-9)
  - object: central_cross
    definition: Cells where row index is 2 OR column index is 2.
    properties:
      - invariant: Cells in the central cross retain their input value (always 7 in examples).
  - object: candidate_cell
    definition: A cell containing the value 7 AND not located in the central_cross.
    properties:
      - subject_to_change: These are the only cells whose values might change.
  - relationship: neighbors
    definition: Cells directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a given cell within grid boundaries.
    role: Influence the output value of candidate_cells.
  - action: transform
    description: Modifies the input grid to produce the output grid based on cell values and locations.
    rule_components:
      - invariance: Cells in the central_cross and cells not containing 7 remain unchanged.
      - modification: Candidate_cells (value 7, outside central_cross) have their value replaced.
      - replacement_logic: The new value seems primarily determined by the values of the input neighbors, likely involving the minimum non-7 neighbor, although the exact rule is not fully resolved by the examples.

```

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input 5x5 grid.
2.  Identify the central cross structure: all cells located at row index 2 OR column index 2. These cells remain unchanged (their value is always 7 in the examples).
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid that is *not* part of the central cross (i.e., where `r != 2` and `c != 2`).
4.  For each such cell `(r, c)`:
    a.  Check the value `v` of the cell in the input grid: `v = input[r, c]`.
    b.  If `v` is not equal to 7, the cell `(r, c)` in the output grid retains its value `v`.
    c.  If `v` is equal to 7:
        i.  Identify the direct (up, down, left, right) neighbors of cell `(r, c)` within the grid boundaries.
        ii. Find the values of these neighbors in the *input* grid.
        iii. Filter this set of neighbor values to exclude any value that is 7.
        iv. If the filtered set of non-7 neighbor values is not empty, find the minimum value (`min_val`) in this set.
        v.  Replace the value of the cell `(r, c)` in the *output* grid with `min_val`. (Note: This step is based on the most plausible pattern observed, but may not perfectly explain all example transformations, indicating potential subtle variations or alternative rules).
        vi. If the filtered set of non-7 neighbors *is* empty (i.e., all neighbors were 7), the cell `(r, c)` in the output grid retains the value 7.
5.  Return the final output grid.
