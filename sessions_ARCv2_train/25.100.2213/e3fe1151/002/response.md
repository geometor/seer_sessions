## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code, based on the "minimum non-7 neighbor" rule, failed to generalize across the training examples. The invariant parts (central cross, non-7 cells outside the cross) were handled correctly, but the transformation rule for the '7' cells outside the cross was incorrect.

The analysis revealed complex patterns:
1.  The transformation rule for a '7' cell outside the cross seems to depend on its quadrant location (UL, UR, LL, LR relative to the central cross).
2.  The replacement value appears to be drawn from specific locations in the input grid, often, but not always, the corners (`input[0,4]`, `input[4,4]`).
3.  A simple mapping (e.g., LR quadrant always uses `input[0,4]`, others use `input[4,4]`) worked for Example 1 but failed for Examples 2 and 3.
4.  Refinements, such as using an alternate source if the primary source was 7, improved accuracy but still failed to capture the full logic (e.g., Example 3 seems to introduce a third source value, `input[4,1]`).

**Strategy:**
The most structured hypothesis involves quadrant-dependent replacement values derived from specific input cells. While the exact source cell mapping is inconsistent across examples, the best approach is to refine the natural language program to describe this quadrant-based logic using the most frequent source cells (`input[0,4]` and `input[4,4]`) and include the observed exception handling (switching sources if one is 7). This captures the most observed structure, even if it doesn't perfectly fit every case. Further examples would be needed to fully resolve the source mapping logic.

## Metrics

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** 5x5 grid. Contains 11 '7's. 4 '7's outside the central cross. Corners: (7, 0, 0, 5).
- **Output:** 5x5 grid. Matches input except for the 4 '7's outside the cross.
- **Changes:**
    - `input[0,0]=7` -> `output[0,0]=5` (UL Quadrant)
    - `input[1,3]=7` -> `output[1,3]=5` (UR Quadrant)
    - `input[3,1]=7` -> `output[3,1]=5` (LL Quadrant)
    - `input[3,3]=7` -> `output[3,3]=0` (LR Quadrant)
- **Source Values:** Replacement values are 5 (`input[4,4]`) and 0 (`input[0,4]`).
- **Code_00 Result:** Failed. Pixels Off: 4. Score: 32.0. The code used min non-7 neighbor rule (0, 1, 1, 1) instead of (5, 5, 5, 0).

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** 5x5 grid. Contains 11 '7's. 4 '7's outside the central cross. Corners: (8, 3, 2, 2).
- **Output:** 5x5 grid. Matches input except for the 4 '7's outside the cross.
- **Changes:**
    - `input[1,1]=7` -> `output[1,1]=2` (UL Quadrant)
    - `input[1,3]=7` -> `output[1,3]=2` (UR Quadrant)
    - `input[3,1]=7` -> `output[3,1]=3` (LL Quadrant)
    - `input[3,3]=7` -> `output[3,3]=3` (LR Quadrant)
- **Source Values:** Replacement values are 2 (`input[4,4]`) and 3 (`input[0,4]`).
- **Code_00 Result:** Failed. Pixels Off: 4. Score: 32.0. The code used min non-7 neighbor rule (3, 8, 8, 8) instead of (2, 2, 3, 3).

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** 5x5 grid. Contains 11 '7's. 4 '7's outside the central cross. Corners: (7, 5, 3, 7). Note: `input[4,4]=7`.
- **Output:** 5x5 grid. Matches input except for the 4 '7's outside the cross.
- **Changes:**
    - `input[0,0]=7` -> `output[0,0]=5` (UL Quadrant)
    - `input[1,3]=7` -> `output[1,3]=4` (UR Quadrant)
    - `input[3,1]=7` -> `output[3,1]=4` (LL Quadrant)
    - `input[4,4]=7` -> `output[4,4]=4` (LR Quadrant)
- **Source Values:** Replacement values appear to be 5 (`input[0,4]`) and 4 (possibly `input[4,1]`).
- **Code_00 Result:** Failed. Pixels Off: 3. Score: 24.0. The code used min non-7 neighbor rule (4, 3, 4, 3) instead of (5, 4, 4, 4). Note that `output[3,1]=4` matched the code's rule.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input 5x5 grid.
2.  Identify the central cross structure: all cells located at row index 2 OR column index 2. These cells remain unchanged.
3.  Identify cells outside the central cross (row index `r != 2` AND column index `c != 2`) whose input value is *not* 7. These cells also remain unchanged.
4.  Iterate through each remaining cell `(r, c)` (these are cells where `r != 2`, `c != 2`, and `input[r, c] == 7`).
5.  For each such cell `(r, c)`:
    a.  Determine the cell's quadrant:
        *   UL (Top-Left): `r < 2` and `c < 2`
        *   UR (Top-Right): `r < 2` and `c > 2`
        *   LL (Bottom-Left): `r > 2` and `c < 2`
        *   LR (Bottom-Right): `r > 2` and `c > 2`
    b.  Define the primary and alternate source cell coordinates based on the quadrant:
        *   If the quadrant is LR: primary source is `(0, 4)`, alternate source is `(4, 4)`.
        *   If the quadrant is UL, UR, or LL: primary source is `(4, 4)`, alternate source is `(0, 4)`.
    c.  Get the value `v_p` from the primary source cell in the *input* grid: `v_p = input[primary_row, primary_col]`.
    d.  Get the value `v_a` from the alternate source cell in the *input* grid: `v_a = input[alternate_row, alternate_col]`.
    e.  Determine the replacement value:
        *   If `v_p` is not equal to 7, the replacement value is `v_p`.
        *   If `v_p` is equal to 7, the replacement value is `v_a`.
        *   (Assumption: It's assumed based on examples that `v_p` and `v_a` will not both be 7 simultaneously, though if they were, the cell would likely remain 7).
    f.  Update the value of the cell `(r, c)` in the *output* grid with the determined replacement value.
6.  Return the final output grid.
