task_elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - cell_type: single digit (0-9)
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - location: (row, column) coordinates (0-based index)
      - value: digit (0-9)
  - object: central_cross
    definition: Cells where row index is 2 OR column index is 2.
    properties:
      - invariant: Cells in the central cross retain their input value (always 7 in examples).
  - object: candidate_cell
    definition: A cell containing the value 7 AND not located in the central_cross (r!=2 AND c!=2).
    properties:
      - subject_to_change: These are the only cells whose values change.
  - object: quadrants
    definition: Four 2x2 regions defined by the central cross:
      - UL: r < 2 and c < 2
      - UR: r < 2 and c > 2
      - LL: r > 2 and c < 2
      - LR: r > 2 and c > 2
    role: Determine the transformation rule for candidate_cells within them.
  - object: source_cells
    definition: Specific cells in the input grid whose values are used for replacement.
    identified_candidates:
      - primary_lr_source: (0, 4) # Top-Right corner
      - primary_other_source: (4, 4) # Bottom-Right corner
    properties:
      - role: Provide replacement values for candidate_cells based on quadrant.
      - exception: If the primary source cell contains 7, the alternate source cell's value might be used. (Rule needs confirmation/refinement as it doesn't explain all examples perfectly).
  - relationship: invariance
    description: Cells in the central_cross, and cells outside the cross whose value is not 7, remain unchanged.
  - action: transform
    description: Modifies the input grid to produce the output grid.
    rule_components:
      - invariance: Apply invariance relationship.
      - modification: For each candidate_cell (value 7, outside central_cross):
          1. Determine its quadrant (UL, UR, LL, LR).
          2. Identify the primary source cell based on the quadrant (LR -> (0,4), others -> (4,4)).
          3. Identify the alternate source cell (LR -> (4,4), others -> (0,4)).
          4. Get the value `v_p` from the primary source cell in the input grid.
          5. Get the value `v_a` from the alternate source cell in the input grid.
          6. If `v_p` is not 7, set the output cell value to `v_p`.
          7. Else (if `v_p` is 7), set the output cell value to `v_a`.
          8. (Note: This rule explains Ex1 perfectly, most of Ex2, but fails on Ex3, suggesting a more complex source selection or backup rule might exist, possibly involving other cells like input[4,1]).
