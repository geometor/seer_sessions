            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code attempt (Code_01) correctly identified the invariant structures (central cross, non-7 cells outside the cross) and the quadrant-dependent nature of the transformation for the '7' cells outside the cross. It also correctly identified `input[0,4]` and `input[4,4]` as key source cells. However, the logic for choosing between these sources and handling the exception where `input[4,4] == 7` was incomplete, leading to failures in Examples 2 and 3.\n\n**Analysis of Failures:**\n\n1.  **Example 2 Failure:** The LL quadrant cell `(3,1)` was expected to become `3` (`input[0,4]`), but the code assigned `2` (`input[4,4]`). This occurred despite `input[4,4]` not being 7, contradicting the simple primary/alternate switch rule.\n2.  **Example 3 Failures:** When `input[4,4]` was 7, the code switched to using `input[0,4]=5` for the UR, LL, and LR quadrants. However, the expected output was `4` for all these cells. This indicated a third source value was needed when `input[4,4]=7`. Additionally, the UL quadrant *did* correctly use `input[0,4]=5`.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe strategy is to refine the transformation rule by:\n1.  Confirming the invariant elements.\n2.  Identifying the correct set of source cells from the input grid. Based on the analysis, `input[0,4]`, `input[4,4]`, and `input[4,1]` appear to be the necessary sources.\n3.  Developing a conditional logic based on the quadrant of the cell being transformed and the values of the source cells (specifically, whether `input[4,4]` is 7, and the comparison between `input[0,4]` and `input[4,4]` otherwise) that correctly maps to the observed outputs across all three examples.\n\n## Metrics\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   **Sources:** `input[0,4]=0` (S1), `input[4,4]=5` (S2), `input[4,1]=1` (S3). Note `S2 != 7` and `S1 < S2`.\n*   **Code_01 Output:** Perfect match.\n*   **Target Changes:**\n    *   UL (0,0): 7 -> 5 (S2)\n    *   UR (1,3): 7 -> 5 (S2)\n    *   LL (3,1): 7 -> 5 (S2)\n    *   LR (3,3): 7 -> 0 (S1)\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   **Sources:** `input[0,4]=3` (S1), `input[4,4]=2` (S2), `input[4,1]=9` (S3). Note `S2 != 7` and `S1 >= S2`.\n*   **Code_01 Output:** Mismatched `output[3,1]` (produced 2, expected 3). Pixels Off: 1. Score: 8.0.\n*   **Target Changes:**\n    *   UL (1,1): 7 -> 2 (S2)\n    *   UR (1,3): 7 -> 2 (S2)\n    *   LL (3,1): 7 -> 3 (S1)\n    *   LR (3,3): 7 -> 3 (S1)\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   **Sources:** `input[0,4]=5` (S1), `input[4,4]=7` (S2), `input[4,1]=4` (S3). Note `S2 == 7`.\n*   **Code_01 Output:** Mismatched `output[1,3]`, `output[3,1]`, `output[3,3]` (produced 5, expected 4 for all). Pixels Off: 3. Score: 24.0.\n*   **Target Changes:**\n    *   UL (0,0): 7 -> 5 (S1)\n    *   UR (1,3): 7 -> 4 (S3)\n    *   LL (3,1): 7 -> 4 (S3)\n    *   LR (3,3): 7 -> 4 (S3)\n\n## Facts\n\n```yaml\ntask_elements:\n  - object: grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array\n      - dimensions: 5x5\n      - cell_type: single digit (0-9)\n  - object: cell\n    properties:\n      - location: (row, column) coordinates (0-based index)\n      - value: digit (0-9)\n  - object: central_cross\n    definition: Cells where row index is 2 OR column index is 2.\n    properties:\n      - invariant: Cells in the central cross retain their input value.\n  - object: candidate_cell\n    definition: A cell `(r, c)` containing the value 7 AND not located in the central_cross (r!=2 AND c!=2).\n    properties:\n      - subject_to_change: These are the only cells whose values change.\n  - object: quadrants\n    definition: Four 2x2 regions defined by the central cross for candidate_cells:\n      - UL: r < 2 and c < 2\n      - UR: r < 2 and c > 2\n      - LL: r > 2 and c < 2\n      - LR: r > 2 and c > 2\n    role: Determine the transformation rule for candidate_cells within them.\n  - object: source_cells\n    definition: Specific cells in the input grid whose values are used for replacement.\n    identified_sources:\n      - S1: value at `input[0, 4]` (Top-Right corner)\n      - S2: value at `input[4, 4]` (Bottom-Right corner)\n      - S3: value at `input[4, 1]` (Bottom row, second column)\n    role: Provide replacement values for candidate_cells based on conditional logic.\n  - relationship: invariance\n    description: Cells in the central_cross, and cells outside the cross whose value is not 7, remain unchanged.\n  - action: transform\n    description: Modifies the input grid to produce the output grid.\n    rule_components:\n      - invariance: Apply invariance relationship.\n      - modification: For each candidate_cell `(r, c)`:\n          1.

If `S2 == 7`:\n                - If quadrant is UL, output value is `S1`.\n                - If quadrant is UR, LL, or LR, output value is `S3`.\n             b.

Assign the determined output value to `output[r, c]`.\n```\n\n## Natural Language Program\n\n1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input 5x5 grid.\n2.  Identify three source values from the *input* grid:\n    *   `S1 = input[0, 4]`\n    *   `S2 = input[4, 4]`\n    *   `S3 = input[4, 1]`\n3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid.\n4.  Check if the cell `(r, c)` should be modified:\n    *   The cell must be *outside* the central cross (i.e., `r != 2` AND `c != 2`).\n    *   The cell's value in the input grid must be 7 (`input[r, c] == 7`).\n5.  If the cell `(r, c)` does not meet both conditions in step 4, its value in the output grid remains unchanged (it keeps the copied input value).\n6.  If the cell `(r, c)` meets both conditions in step 4 (it's a '7' outside the central cross), determine its replacement value based on the following logic:\n    a.  **Check the value of S2:**\n        i.  **If `S2 == 7`:**\n            *   Determine the quadrant of `(r, c)`:\n                *   If `r < 2` and `c < 2` (UL quadrant), the replacement value is `S1`.\n                *   Otherwise (UR, LL, or LR quadrants), the replacement value is `S3`.\n        ii. **Else (`S2 != 7`):**\n            *   Determine the quadrant of `(r, c)`:\n                *   If `r > 2` and `c > 2` (LR quadrant), the replacement value is `S1`.\n                *   If `r < 2` (UL or UR quadrants), the replacement value is `S2`.\n                *   If `r > 2` and `c < 2` (LL quadrant):\n                    *   Compare `S1` and `S2`:\n                        *   If `S1 < S2`, the replacement value is `S2`.\n                        *   If `S1 >= S2`, the replacement value is `S1`.\n    b.  Update the value of the cell `(r, c)` in the *output* grid with the determined replacement value.\n7.  Return the final output grid."
