task_elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - cell_type: single digit (0-9)
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - location: (row, column) coordinates (0-based index)
      - value: digit (0-9)
  - object: central_cross
    definition: Cells where row index is 2 OR column index is 2.
    properties:
      - invariant: Cells in the central cross retain their input value.
  - object: candidate_cell
    definition: A cell `(r, c)` containing the value 7 AND not located in the central_cross (r!=2 AND c!=2).
    properties:
      - subject_to_change: These are the only cells whose values change.
  - object: quadrants
    definition: Four 2x2 regions defined by the central cross for candidate_cells:
      - UL: r < 2 and c < 2
      - UR: r < 2 and c > 2
      - LL: r > 2 and c < 2
      - LR: r > 2 and c > 2
    role: Determine the transformation rule for candidate_cells within them.
  - object: source_cells
    definition: Specific cells in the input grid whose values are used for replacement.
    identified_sources:
      - S1: value at `input[0, 4]` (Top-Right corner)
      - S2: value at `input[4, 4]` (Bottom-Right corner)
      - S3: value at `input[4, 1]` (Bottom row, second column)
    role: Provide replacement values for candidate_cells based on conditional logic.
  - relationship: invariance
    description: Cells in the central_cross, and cells outside the cross whose value is not 7, remain unchanged.
  - action: transform
    description: Modifies the input grid to produce the output grid.
    rule_components:
      - invariance: Apply invariance relationship.
      - modification: For each candidate_cell `(r, c)`:
          1. Retrieve source values: `S1=input[0,4]`, `S2=input[4,4]`, `S3=input[4,1]`.
          2. Determine quadrant of `(r, c)`.
          3. Apply conditional logic:
             a. If `S2 == 7`:
                - If quadrant is UL, output value is `S1`.
                - If quadrant is UR, LL, or LR, output value is `S3`.
             b. Else (`S2 != 7`):
                - If quadrant is LR, output value is `S1`.
                - If quadrant is UL or UR, output value is `S2`.
                - If quadrant is LL:
                   - If `S1 < S2`, output value is `S2`.
                   - Else (`S1 >= S2`), output value is `S1`.
          4. Assign the determined output value to `output[r, c]`.
