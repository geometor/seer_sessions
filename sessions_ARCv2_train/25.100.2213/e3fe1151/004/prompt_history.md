Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 5x5 grids containing single digits (0-9).
2.  **Core Object:** The central element seems to be the digit '7'.
3.  **Invariant Structure:** A central "cross" pattern formed by row index 2 and column index 2 appears invariant across all examples. All cells within this cross (row 2 or column 2) contain the digit 7 in the input and remain 7 in the output.
4.  **Conditional Change:** Changes only occur at cells that contain the digit 7 in the input AND are *not* part of the central invariant cross (i.e., neither row index nor column index is 2).
5.  **Change Mechanism:** For the input 7s located outside the central cross, their value is replaced in the output. The new value appears related to the values of their direct (up, down, left, right - Von Neumann) neighbors in the input grid.
6.  **Neighbor Influence:** The most likely rule involves finding the minimum value among the direct neighbors, potentially excluding neighbors that are also 7. However, applying this rule ("minimum non-7 neighbor") directly doesn't perfectly match all transformations, suggesting a more complex condition or a different rule entirely might be at play, although it matches in some cases (e.g., train_3, cell (3,1)). Other cells that are not 7 remain unchanged.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input 5x5 grid.
2.  Identify the central cross structure: all cells located at row index 2 OR column index 2. These cells remain unchanged (their value is always 7 in the examples).
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid that is *not* part of the central cross (i.e., where `r != 2` and `c != 2`).
4.  For each such cell `(r, c)`:
    a.  Check the value `v` of the cell in the input grid: `v = input[r, c]`.
    b.  If `v` is not equal to 7, the cell `(r, c)` in the output grid retains its value `v`.
    c.  If `v` is equal to 7:
        i.  Identify the direct (up, down, left, right) neighbors of cell `(r, c)` within the grid boundaries.
        ii. Find the values of these neighbors in the *input* grid.
        iii. Filter this set of neighbor values to exclude any value that is 7.
        iv. If the filtered set of non-7 neighbor values is not empty, find the minimum value (`min_val`) in this set.
        v.  Replace the value of the cell `(r, c)` in the *output* grid with `min_val`. (Note: This step is based on the most plausible pattern observed, but may not perfectly explain all example transformations, indicating potential subtle variations or alternative rules).
        vi. If the filtered set of non-7 neighbors *is* empty (i.e., all neighbors were 7), the cell `(r, c)` in the output grid retains the value 7.
5.  Return the final output grid.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code, based on the "minimum non-7 neighbor" rule, failed to generalize across the training examples. The invariant parts (central cross, non-7 cells outside the cross) were handled correctly, but the transformation rule for the '7' cells outside the cross was incorrect.

The analysis revealed complex patterns:
1.  The transformation rule for a '7' cell outside the cross seems to depend on its quadrant location (UL, UR, LL, LR relative to the central cross).
2.  The replacement value appears to be drawn from specific locations in the input grid, often, but not always, the corners (`input[0,4]`, `input[4,4]`).
3.  A simple mapping (e.g., LR quadrant always uses `input[0,4]`, others use `input[4,4]`) worked for Example 1 but failed for Examples 2 and 3.
4.  Refinements, such as using an alternate source if the primary source was 7, improved accuracy but still failed to capture the full logic (e.g., Example 3 seems to introduce a third source value, `input[4,1]`).

**Strategy:**
The most structured hypothesis involves quadrant-dependent replacement values derived from specific input cells. While the exact source cell mapping is inconsistent across examples, the best approach is to refine the natural language program to describe this quadrant-based logic using the most frequent source cells (`input[0,4]` and `input[4,4]`) and include the observed exception handling (switching sources if one is 7). This captures the most observed structure, even if it doesn't perfectly fit every case. Further examples would be needed to fully resolve the source mapping logic.

## Metrics

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** 5x5 grid. Contains 11 '7's. 4 '7's outside the central cross. Corners: (7, 0, 0, 5).
- **Output:** 5x5 grid. Matches input except for the 4 '7's outside the cross.
- **Changes:**
    - `input[0,0]=7` -> `output[0,0]=5` (UL Quadrant)
    - `input[1,3]=7` -> `output[1,3]=5` (UR Quadrant)
    - `input[3,1]=7` -> `output[3,1]=5` (LL Quadrant)
    - `input[3,3]=7` -> `output[3,3]=0` (LR Quadrant)
- **Source Values:** Replacement values are 5 (`input[4,4]`) and 0 (`input[0,4]`).
- **Code_00 Result:** Failed. Pixels Off: 4. Score: 32.0. The code used min non-7 neighbor rule (0, 1, 1, 1) instead of (5, 5, 5, 0).

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** 5x5 grid. Contains 11 '7's. 4 '7's outside the central cross. Corners: (8, 3, 2, 2).
- **Output:** 5x5 grid. Matches input except for the 4 '7's outside the cross.
- **Changes:**
    - `input[1,1]=7` -> `output[1,1]=2` (UL Quadrant)
    - `input[1,3]=7` -> `output[1,3]=2` (UR Quadrant)
    - `input[3,1]=7` -> `output[3,1]=3` (LL Quadrant)
    - `input[3,3]=7` -> `output[3,3]=3` (LR Quadrant)
- **Source Values:** Replacement values are 2 (`input[4,4]`) and 3 (`input[0,4]`).
- **Code_00 Result:** Failed. Pixels Off: 4. Score: 32.0. The code used min non-7 neighbor rule (3, 8, 8, 8) instead of (2, 2, 3, 3).

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** 5x5 grid. Contains 11 '7's. 4 '7's outside the central cross. Corners: (7, 5, 3, 7). Note: `input[4,4]=7`.
- **Output:** 5x5 grid. Matches input except for the 4 '7's outside the cross.
- **Changes:**
    - `input[0,0]=7` -> `output[0,0]=5` (UL Quadrant)
    - `input[1,3]=7` -> `output[1,3]=4` (UR Quadrant)
    - `input[3,1]=7` -> `output[3,1]=4` (LL Quadrant)
    - `input[4,4]=7` -> `output[4,4]=4` (LR Quadrant)
- **Source Values:** Replacement values appear to be 5 (`input[0,4]`) and 4 (possibly `input[4,1]`).
- **Code_00 Result:** Failed. Pixels Off: 3. Score: 24.0. The code used min non-7 neighbor rule (4, 3, 4, 3) instead of (5, 4, 4, 4). Note that `output[3,1]=4` matched the code's rule.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input 5x5 grid.
2.  Identify the central cross structure: all cells located at row index 2 OR column index 2. These cells remain unchanged.
3.  Identify cells outside the central cross (row index `r != 2` AND column index `c != 2`) whose input value is *not* 7. These cells also remain unchanged.
4.  Iterate through each remaining cell `(r, c)` (these are cells where `r != 2`, `c != 2`, and `input[r, c] == 7`).
5.  For each such cell `(r, c)`:
    a.  Determine the cell's quadrant:
        *   UL (Top-Left): `r < 2` and `c < 2`
        *   UR (Top-Right): `r < 2` and `c > 2`
        *   LL (Bottom-Left): `r > 2` and `c < 2`
        *   LR (Bottom-Right): `r > 2` and `c > 2`
    b.  Define the primary and alternate source cell coordinates based on the quadrant:
        *   If the quadrant is LR: primary source is `(0, 4)`, alternate source is `(4, 4)`.
        *   If the quadrant is UL, UR, or LL: primary source is `(4, 4)`, alternate source is `(0, 4)`.
    c.  Get the value `v_p` from the primary source cell in the *input* grid: `v_p = input[primary_row, primary_col]`.
    d.  Get the value `v_a` from the alternate source cell in the *input* grid: `v_a = input[alternate_row, alternate_col]`.
    e.  Determine the replacement value:

   b. Define primary and alternate source cells based on the quadrant:
      - LR quadrant (r > 2, c > 2): Primary source is (0, 4), Alternate is (4, 4).
      - UL, UR, LL quadrants: Primary source is (4, 4), Alternate is (0, 4).
   c. Get the values v_p and v_a from the primary and alternate source cells in the *input* grid.
   d. Determine the replacement value: If v_p is not 7, use v_p. Otherwise, use v_a.
   e. Update the output grid cell (r, c) with the replacement value.
5. Return the modified output grid.
