## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code attempt (Code_01) correctly identified the invariant structures (central cross, non-7 cells outside the cross) and the quadrant-dependent nature of the transformation for the '7' cells outside the cross. It also correctly identified `input[0,4]` and `input[4,4]` as key source cells. However, the logic for choosing between these sources and handling the exception where `input[4,4] == 7` was incomplete, leading to failures in Examples 2 and 3.

**Analysis of Failures:**

1.  **Example 2 Failure:** The LL quadrant cell `(3,1)` was expected to become `3` (`input[0,4]`), but the code assigned `2` (`input[4,4]`). This occurred despite `input[4,4]` not being 7, contradicting the simple primary/alternate switch rule.
2.  **Example 3 Failures:** When `input[4,4]` was 7, the code switched to using `input[0,4]=5` for the UR, LL, and LR quadrants. However, the expected output was `4` for all these cells. This indicated a third source value was needed when `input[4,4]=7`. Additionally, the UL quadrant *did* correctly use `input[0,4]=5`.

**Strategy:**

The strategy is to refine the transformation rule by:
1.  Confirming the invariant elements.
2.  Identifying the correct set of source cells from the input grid. Based on the analysis, `input[0,4]`, `input[4,4]`, and `input[4,1]` appear to be the necessary sources.
3.  Developing a conditional logic based on the quadrant of the cell being transformed and the values of the source cells (specifically, whether `input[4,4]` is 7, and the comparison between `input[0,4]` and `input[4,4]` otherwise) that correctly maps to the observed outputs across all three examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input 5x5 grid.
2.  Identify three source values from the *input* grid:
    *   `S1 = input[0, 4]`
    *   `S2 = input[4, 4]`
    *   `S3 = input[4, 1]`
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid.
4.  Check if the cell `(r, c)` should be modified:
    *   The cell must be *outside* the central cross (i.e., `r != 2` AND `c != 2`).
    *   The cell's value in the input grid must be 7 (`input[r, c] == 7`).
5.  If the cell `(r, c)` does not meet both conditions in step 4, its value in the output grid remains unchanged (it keeps the copied input value).
6.  If the cell `(r, c)` meets both conditions in step 4 (it's a '7' outside the central cross), determine its replacement value based on the following logic:
    a.  **Check the value of S2:**
        i.  **If `S2 == 7`:**
            *   Determine the quadrant of `(r, c)`:
                *   If `r < 2` and `c < 2` (UL quadrant), the replacement value is `S1`.
                *   Otherwise (UR, LL, or LR quadrants), the replacement value is `S3`.
        ii. **Else (`S2 != 7`):**
            *   Determine the quadrant of `(r, c)`:
                *   If `r > 2` and `c > 2` (LR quadrant), the replacement value is `S1`.
                *   If `r < 2` (UL or UR quadrants), the replacement value is `S2`.
                *   If `r > 2` and `c < 2` (LL quadrant):
                    *   Compare `S1` and `S2`:
                        *   If `S1 < S2`, the replacement value is `S2`.
                        *   If `S1 >= S2`, the replacement value is `S1`.
    b.  Update the value of the cell `(r, c)` in the *output* grid with the determined replacement value.
7.  Return the final output grid.
