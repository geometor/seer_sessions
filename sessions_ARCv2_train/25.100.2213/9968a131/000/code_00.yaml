task_elements:
  - object: input_grid
    description: A 2D array or list of lists containing numbers.
  - object: output_grid
    description: A 2D array derived from the input_grid, having the same dimensions.
  - object: row
    description: A 1D array or list representing a horizontal line of numbers within the grid.
    properties:
      - index: The 1-based position of the row within the grid (e.g., 1st row, 2nd row).
      - parity: Whether the index is odd or even.
  - object: element
    description: A single number within a row.
    properties:
      - value: The numerical value.
      - position: The index of the element within its row.

actions:
  - action: copy_row
    description: Transferring a row directly from the input_grid to the corresponding position in the output_grid without modification.
  - action: right_circular_shift
    description: Modifying a row by moving the last element to the first position and shifting all other elements one position to the right.

relationships:
  - relationship: row_modification_based_on_parity
    description: >
      The transformation applied to a row depends on its index parity.
      Odd-indexed rows (1st, 3rd, etc.) are processed using the `copy_row` action.
      Even-indexed rows (2nd, 4th, etc.) are processed using the `right_circular_shift` action.
  - relationship: grid_structure_preservation
    description: The output_grid maintains the same number of rows and columns as the input_grid.
