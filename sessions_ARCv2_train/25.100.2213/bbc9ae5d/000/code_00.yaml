Input:
  type: sequence
  elements: integers (single digits)
  structure:
    - non_zero_prefix: one or more identical non-zero digits (fill_digit)
    - zero_suffix: zero or more zeros
Output:
  type: list of sequences
  generation: iterative
  first_element: identical to the input sequence
  subsequent_elements: derived by replacing the first '0' with the 'fill_digit' from the previous sequence
Parameters:
  - fill_digit: The non-zero digit found at the beginning of the input sequence.
  - initial_non_zero_count (N): The number of non-zero digits at the start of the input sequence.
  - key_value: The value of the N-th digit (0-indexed: digit at index N-1) in the input sequence. This is the last non-zero digit initially.
  - step_count (k): The number of zero-replacement steps to perform. Determined by the key_value.
Mapping (key_value to step_count):
  1: 2
  2: 3
  5: 4
  7: 2
  8: 2
Relationships:
  - The number of output sequences is step_count + 1.
  - Each step transforms the sequence by replacing the leftmost '0' with the 'fill_digit'.
  - The 'step_count' is derived solely from the 'key_value' using the defined mapping.
