**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves processing a sequence of single-digit integers provided as input. This input sequence consists of one or more occurrences of a specific non-zero digit (let's call it the 'fill digit') at the beginning, followed by zero or more zeros. The transformation generates a series of sequences, starting with the original input sequence. Each subsequent sequence is derived from the previous one by changing the first occurrence of a zero to the 'fill digit'. This process repeats a specific number of times. The core challenge is determining how many times this zero-replacement step should occur. Observation suggests this number of steps (`k`) is not simply the count of zeros but is determined by the *value* of the *last* non-zero digit in the *initial* input sequence, according to a fixed mapping observed across the examples.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
Input:
  type: sequence
  elements: integers (single digits)
  structure:
    - non_zero_prefix: one or more identical non-zero digits (fill_digit)
    - zero_suffix: zero or more zeros
Output:
  type: list of sequences
  generation: iterative
  first_element: identical to the input sequence
  subsequent_elements: derived by replacing the first '0' with the 'fill_digit' from the previous sequence
Parameters:
  - fill_digit: The non-zero digit found at the beginning of the input sequence.
  - initial_non_zero_count (N): The number of non-zero digits at the start of the input sequence.
  - key_value: The value of the N-th digit (0-indexed: digit at index N-1) in the input sequence. This is the last non-zero digit initially.
  - step_count (k): The number of zero-replacement steps to perform. Determined by the key_value.
Mapping (key_value to step_count):
  1: 2
  2: 3
  5: 4
  7: 2
  8: 2
Relationships:
  - The number of output sequences is step_count + 1.
  - Each step transforms the sequence by replacing the leftmost '0' with the 'fill_digit'.
  - The 'step_count' is derived solely from the 'key_value' using the defined mapping.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization**:
    *   Read the input line and convert it into a list of integers (the `initial_sequence`).
    *   Identify the first non-zero integer in the `initial_sequence`; this is the `fill_digit`.
    *   Count the number of non-zero integers at the beginning of the `initial_sequence`; let this count be `N`.
    *   Determine the integer value at the `N`-th position (index `N-1`) of the `initial_sequence`; this is the `key_value`.

2.  **Determine Step Count**:
    *   Based on the `key_value`, find the corresponding number of steps `k` using the rule:
        *   If `key_value` is 1, `k` is 2.
        *   If `key_value` is 2, `k` is 3.
        *   If `key_value` is 5, `k` is 4.
        *   If `key_value` is 7, `k` is 2.
        *   If `key_value` is 8, `k` is 2.

3.  **Generate Output**:
    *   Print the `initial_sequence`.
    *   Make a copy of the `initial_sequence` called `current_sequence`.
    *   Repeat `k` times:
        *   Find the index of the first occurrence of `0` in the `current_sequence`.
        *   If a `0` is found at index `zero_index`:
            *   Update the `current_sequence` by setting the element at `zero_index` to the `fill_digit`.
            *   Print the updated `current_sequence`.
        *   If no `0` is found, stop the repetition early.
