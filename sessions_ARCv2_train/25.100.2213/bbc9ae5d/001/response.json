The sequence starts with one or more identical non-zero digits ('fill_digit') followed by zero or more zeros.\nThe transformation generates a series of sequences:\n1. The first sequence is the original input.\n2. Subsequent sequences are created by iteratively replacing the leftmost '0' with the 'fill_digit'.\n3. The number of replacement steps ('k') is determined by the value of the last non-zero digit in the *initial* input sequence, based on a fixed mapping: {1: 2, 2: 3, 5: 4, 7: 2, 8: 2}.\nThe total number of output sequences is k + 1.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport copy\n\ndef find_first_non_zero_digit(sequence: list[int]) -> int | None:\n    \"\"\"Finds the first non-zero digit in the sequence.\"\"\"\n    for digit in sequence:\n        if digit != 0:\n            return digit\n    return None # Should not happen based on problem description\n\ndef count_initial_non_zeros(sequence: list[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Counts the number of non-zero digits at the beginning of the sequence.\"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    for digit in sequence:\n        if digit != 0:\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            break\n    return count\n\ndef find_first_zero_index(sequence: list[int]) -> int | None:\n    \"\"\"Finds the index of the first zero in the sequence.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        return sequence.index(0)\n    except ValueError:\n        return None # No zero found\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a sequence of lists by iteratively replacing the first zero\n    with the initial non-zero digit, based on a rule determined by the\n    last initial non-zero digit's value.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list containing a single list of integers representing\n                    the input sequence. e.g., [[8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]]\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists, where each inner list represents a step in the\n        transformation sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Assuming the input_grid contains exactly one sequence\n    if not input_grid:\n        return []\n    initial_sequence = input_grid[0]\n    \n    # Initialize the list of output sequences with the input sequence\n    output_sequences = [initial_sequence]\n\n    # --- Initialization Phase ---\n    # Find the 'fill_digit' (the first non-zero digit)\n    fill_digit = find_first_non_zero_digit(initial_sequence)\n    if fill_digit is None:\n         # Handle cases with only zeros or empty input, although examples don't show this\n         return output_sequences \n\n    # Count initial non-zeros to find 'N'\n    n = count_initial_non_zeros(initial_sequence)\n    if n == 0: \n         # Should not happen based on problem description (at least one non-zero)\n         return output_sequences\n\n    # Determine the 'key_value' (the N-th digit, index N-1)\n    # Check if index is valid (e.g., for input like [0, 0, 8])\n    if n > len(initial_sequence):\n         # Invalid input structure based on examples\n         return output_sequences # Or raise an error\n    key_value = initial_sequence[n - 1]\n\n    # --- Determine Step Count (k) ---\n    # Mapping from key_value to the number of steps (k)\n    step_count_map = {\n        1: 2,\n        2: 3,\n        5: 4,\n        7: 2,\n        8: 2,\n    }\n    # Get the number of steps 'k', default to 0 if key_value not in map\n    k = step_count_map.get(key_value, 0) \n    # If key_value is 0, it means initial non-zero count was incorrect or input format differs\n    if key_value == 0:\n        k = 0 # Treat as 0 steps if the N-th digit is unexpectedly 0\n\n    # --- Generate Output Sequences ---\n    # Start with a mutable copy of the initial sequence for transformation\n    current_sequence = list(initial_sequence) # Use list() or copy.copy() for a shallow copy\n\n    # Perform 'k' transformation steps\n    for _ in range(k):\n        # Find the index of the first zero to replace\n        zero_index = find_first_zero_index(current_sequence)\n\n        # If a zero is found\n        if zero_index is not None:\n            # Create a new list for the next state to avoid modifying previous states\n            next_sequence = list(current_sequence) \n            # Replace the zero with the fill_digit\n            next_sequence[zero_index] = fill_digit\n            # Add the new sequence to the output list\n            output_sequences.append(next_sequence)\n            # Update current_sequence for the next iteration\n            current_sequence = next_sequence\n        else:\n            # If no zero is found, stop generating further sequences\n            break\n\n    return output_sequences\n```"
