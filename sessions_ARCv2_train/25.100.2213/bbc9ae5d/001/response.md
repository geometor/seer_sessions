```python
"""
Processes an input sequence of single-digit integers. The sequence starts with one or more identical non-zero digits ('fill_digit') followed by zero or more zeros.
The transformation generates a series of sequences:
1. The first sequence is the original input.
2. Subsequent sequences are created by iteratively replacing the leftmost '0' with the 'fill_digit'.
3. The number of replacement steps ('k') is determined by the value of the last non-zero digit in the *initial* input sequence, based on a fixed mapping: {1: 2, 2: 3, 5: 4, 7: 2, 8: 2}.
The total number of output sequences is k + 1.
