*   **Perception:** The input consists of nine lines, each containing three space-separated integers. These nine lines are implicitly grouped into three blocks of three lines each. The output always consists of one of these three-line blocks. The core task is to identify which of the three input blocks should be selected as the output. By examining the structure of the numbers within each block (treating each block as a 3x3 matrix), the determining factor appears to be matrix symmetry. The first block encountered (reading from top to bottom) that is *not* symmetric is chosen as the output.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    ```yaml
    task_elements:
      - input_lines: A list of 9 strings.
      - numbers: Integers parsed from the input lines.
      - blocks: Three groups, each consisting of 3 input lines.
      - matrix: Each block can be interpreted as a 3x3 matrix of integers.
      - output_block: One of the input blocks selected as the output.
    
    input_structure:
      - format: 9 lines of text.
      - line_content: 3 space-separated integers per line.
      - grouping: Implicitly divided into three blocks (lines 1-3, 4-6, 7-9).
    
    block_properties:
      - representation: Can be viewed as a 3x3 matrix.
      - symmetry: A block is symmetric if the element at row `i`, column `j` is equal to the element at row `j`, column `i` for all `i, j`.
    
    transformation:
      - name: Select First Non-Symmetric Block
      - steps:
          - Parse input into three 3x3 blocks (matrices).
          - Iterate through the blocks in order (Block 1, Block 2, Block 3).
          - For each block, test for symmetry.
          - Select the first block that fails the symmetry test (is non-symmetric).
      - output: The selected non-symmetric block, formatted as 3 lines of text.
    
    relationships:
      - The output is identical to one of the three sequential blocks within the input.
      - The selection depends on the order and the symmetry property of the blocks.
    ```

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Read the 9 lines of the input.
    2.  Group the lines into three blocks: Block 1 (lines 1-3), Block 2 (lines 4-6), and Block 3 (lines 7-9).
    3.  For each block, parse the numbers on its three lines to form a 3x3 matrix of integers.
    4.  Define a condition `is_symmetric` for a 3x3 matrix `M`: `M[i][j]` must equal `M[j][i]` for all row indices `i` and column indices `j` (where indices are 0, 1, 2).
    5.  Check if Block 1 satisfies the `is_symmetric` condition. If it does not, select Block 1 as the result.
    6.  If Block 1 is symmetric, check if Block 2 satisfies the `is_symmetric` condition. If it does not, select Block 2 as the result.
    7.  If both Block 1 and Block 2 are symmetric, select Block 3 as the result (implicitly, Block 3 must be non-symmetric based on the examples).
    8.  Output the three lines corresponding to the selected block.
