## Perception

The input is a small 3x3 grid containing integers (0, 2, 3). The output is a larger 9x9 grid containing integers (0, 3). The structure of the output grid seems directly related to the input grid, suggesting a scaling or tiling operation.

Observing the examples:
- Each cell in the 3x3 input grid appears to correspond to a 3x3 block in the 9x9 output grid.
- If an input cell contains the value 0, the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid is filled entirely with 0s.
- If an input cell contains a non-zero value (like 2 or 3), the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid is filled entirely with 3s. The specific non-zero value (2 or 3) in the input doesn't seem to affect the output block's value, only the fact that it is non-zero.

The transformation rule essentially uses the input grid as a template to construct the output grid, scaling it up by a factor of 3 and mapping the input cell values (zero vs. non-zero) to specific fill values (0 vs. 3) for the corresponding output blocks.

## Facts

```yaml
Input:
  type: grid
  dimensions: 3x3
  cell_values: integers (0, 2, 3)
  role: template grid

Output:
  type: grid
  dimensions: 9x9
  cell_values: integers (0, 3)
  role: scaled grid

Transformation:
  action: scaling and mapping
  scaling_factor: 3 (both dimensions)
  mapping_rule:
    - input_condition: cell value is 0
      output_block_value: 0
    - input_condition: cell value is non-zero (e.g., 2 or 3)
      output_block_value: 3
  process: Each cell in the input grid determines the fill value for a corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid.

Relationships:
  - Each input cell `(r, c)` maps to the output block starting at `(3*r, 3*c)`.
  - The output grid size is determined by the input grid size multiplied by the scaling factor.
  - The content of each 3x3 output block depends solely on whether the corresponding input cell is zero or non-zero.
```

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with dimensions 3 times the height and 3 times the width of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid using its row index `r` (from 0 to height-1) and column index `c` (from 0 to width-1).
3.  Retrieve the value `v` from the input grid at `(r, c)`.
4.  Determine the target fill value for the output block:
    *   If `v` is 0, the `fill_value` is 0.
    *   If `v` is not 0, the `fill_value` is 3.
5.  Calculate the top-left coordinates `(R, C)` for the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid: `R = 3 * r`, `C = 3 * c`.
6.  Fill the 3x3 block in the output grid starting at `(R, C)` with the determined `fill_value`. This means setting the value of `output[i][j]` to `fill_value` for all `i` from `R` to `R+2` and all `j` from `C` to `C+2`.
7.  After iterating through all input cells, return the completed output grid.
