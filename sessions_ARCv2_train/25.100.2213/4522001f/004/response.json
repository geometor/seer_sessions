            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified a scaling relationship (3x3 input to 9x9 output) and a value mapping (non-zero input -> output 3, zero input -> output 0). However, the simple block scaling model implemented in the first code attempt failed to produce the correct output patterns. The execution results provided in the previous step appeared inconsistent both with the expected outputs and the logic of the code itself, suggesting they should be disregarded.\n\nRe-evaluating the `input` and `Expected Output` pairs reveals a different pattern:\n1.  The output grid size is consistently 9x9.\n2.  The output grid contains only 0s and 3s.\n3.  Instead of scaling each input cell to a 3x3 block, the transformation identifies the locations of the *first* and *last* non-zero cells in the input grid (scanning row-major and reverse row-major, respectively).\n4.  These two input locations determine the top-left corners for placing two distinct 4x4 blocks of the value 3 in the output grid.\n5.  The mapping rule is:\n    *   First non-zero input at `(r1, c1)` places a 4x4 block of 3s starting at output `(r1, c1)`.\n    *   Last non-zero input at `(r2, c2)` places a 4x4 block of 3s starting at output `(r2 + 3, c2 + 3)`.\n6.  If there are no non-zero cells, the output is all zeros. If there is only one non-zero cell, it acts as both the first and the last, potentially causing the two 4x4 blocks to overlap.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Discard the previous block scaling model.\n2.  Implement the new hypothesis based on finding the first and last non-zero input cells.\n3.  Define the transformation based on placing two 4x4 blocks of 3s at positions derived from these first/last coordinates using the identified mapping rules `(r, c) -> (r, c)` and `(r, c) -> (r+3, c+3)`.\n4.  Document this new understanding in the facts and natural language program.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example   | Grid        | Dimensions | Colors       | Non-Zero Coords (Input)                  | Output 3s Block Top-Left Coords | Notes                                            |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :--------- | :----------- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |\n| Train 1   | Input       | 3x3        | {0, 2, 3}    | (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)               |                                 | First: (1,1), Last: (2,2)                      |\n|           | Expected    | 9x9        | {0, 3}       |                                          | (1,1), (5,5)                    | Two 4x4 blocks of 3s.                            |\n| Train 2   | Input       | 3x3        | {0, 2, 3}    | (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)               |                                 | First: (0,0), Last: (1,1)                      |\n|           | Expected    | 9x9        | {0, 3}       |                                          | (0,0), (4,4)                    | Two 4x4 blocks of 3s.                            |\n\n**Observations from Metrics:**\n*   Output dimension is always 9x9.\n*   Output palette is always {0, 3}.\n*   The locations of the '3' blocks in the output are not simple scaling but seem tied to the *first* and *last* non-zero positions in the input.\n*   Mapping rule confirmed:\n    *   `first_input(r1, c1)` -> `output_block_1(r1, c1)`\n    *   `last_input(r2, c2)` -> `output_block_2(r2 + 3, c2 + 3)`\n*   The size of the output blocks of '3's is consistently 4x4.\n\n## Facts\n\n```yaml\nInput_Grid:\n  type: object\n  description: A 3x3 grid containing integer values.\n  properties:\n    height: 3\n    width: 3\n    cells:\n      contain: integer values\n      possible_values: [0, 2, 3]\n  derived_properties:\n    first_non_zero_cell:\n      description: Coordinates (row, col) of the first cell with a value != 0, found by scanning row-by-row, then column-by-column.

Create a 9x9 output grid and initialize all its cells to 0.\n2.  Initialize variables `first_nz_coord` and `last_nz_coord` to `None`.\n3.  Iterate through the 3x3 input grid row by row (from `r=0` to 2), and within each row, column by column (from `c=0` to 2).\n    *   If the current cell `(r, c)` contains a non-zero value:\n        *   Update `last_nz_coord` to `(r, c)`.\n        *   If `first_nz_coord` is still `None`, set `first_nz_coord` to `(r, c)`.\n4.  Check if `first_nz_coord` is not `None`. If it is:\n    *   Let `(r1, c1)` be the coordinates stored in `first_nz_coord`.\n    *   Determine the top-left corner `(R1, C1)` for the first 4x4 block as `(r1, c1)`.\n    *   Fill the 4x4 block in the output grid starting at `(R1, C1)` with the value 3. Specifically, set `output[i][j] = 3` for all `i` from `R1` to `R1+3` and all `j` from `C1` to `C1+3`, ensuring boundary checks for the 9x9 grid.\n5.  Check if `last_nz_coord` is not `None`. If it is:\n    *   Let `(r2, c2)` be the coordinates stored in `last_nz_coord`.\n    *   Calculate the top-left corner `(R2, C2)` for the second 4x4 block as `(r2 + 3, c2 + 3)`.\n    *   Fill the 4x4 block in the output grid starting at `(R2, C2)` with the value 3. Specifically, set `output[i][j] = 3` for all `i` from `R2` to `R2+3` and all `j` from `C2` to `C2+3`, ensuring boundary checks for the 9x9 grid.\n6.  Return the completed 9x9 output grid."
