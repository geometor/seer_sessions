The output grid is consistently 4 rows by 4 columns.\n3.  **Value Domain:** The input grids contain the integers 0, 5, and 6. The output grids contain the integers 0 and 4.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves reducing the width of the grid by half while keeping the height the same. This suggests a process that relates the left half of the input grid to the right half to produce the output grid.\n5.  **Core Logic:** Observing the examples, an output cell at position `(r, c)` is set to 4 if and only if the input cell at `(r, c)` (in the left half) *and* the input cell at `(r, c+4)` (in the right half) are both 0. In all other cases, the output cell at `(r, c)` is 0. The input values 5 and 6 seem to function identically in that they prevent the condition (both inputs being 0) from being met.\n\n**Facts**\n\n```yaml\ntask_description: Transform a 4x8 input grid into a 4x4 output grid based on comparing corresponding cells from the left and right halves of the input.\n\ninput_grid:\n  properties:\n    rows: 4\n    columns: 8\n    cell_values: [0, 5, 6]\n  structure:\n    can_be_split_into:\n      - left_half:\n          rows: 4\n          columns: 4\n          indices: (r, c) where 0 <= c < 4\n      - right_half:\n          rows: 4\n          columns: 4\n          indices: (r, c') where 4 <= c' < 8\n\noutput_grid:\n  properties:\n    rows: 4\n    columns: 4\n    cell_values: [0, 4]\n\ntransformation_rule:\n  steps:\n    - conceptually_split: Input grid into 'left_half' (columns 0-3) and 'right_half' (columns 4-7).\n    - iterate: Through each cell position (r, c) from (0, 0) to (3, 3).\n    - compare: The value of the cell 'left_half[r, c]' and 'right_half[r, c]'.\n    - condition:\n        if: left_half[r, c] == 0 AND right_half[r, c] == 0\n        then: output_grid[r, c] = 4\n        else: output_grid[r, c] = 0\n  relationship: The value of output_grid[r, c] depends directly on the values of input_grid[r, c] and input_grid[r, c+4].\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  Initialize an empty 4x4 output grid, filled with zeros.\n2.  Iterate through each row `r` from 0 to 3.\n3.  Inside the row loop, iterate through each column `c` from 0 to 3.\n4.  For the current `(r, c)`, examine the value in the input grid at `(r, c)` (let's call this `left_value`).\n5.  Examine the value in the input grid at `(r, c + 4)` (let's call this `right_value`).\n6.  Check if both `left_value` is 0 AND `right_value` is 0.\n7.  If the condition in step 6 is true, set the value of the output grid at position `(r, c)` to 4.\n8.  If the condition in step 6 is false, the output grid value at `(r, c)` remains 0 (as initialized or explicitly set).\n9.  After iterating through all `(r, c)` positions, return the completed 4x4 output grid."
