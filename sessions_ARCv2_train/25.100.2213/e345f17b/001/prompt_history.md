**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output:** The task takes a grid of numbers as input and produces a smaller grid of numbers as output.
2.  **Grid Dimensions:** The input grid is consistently 4 rows by 8 columns. The output grid is consistently 4 rows by 4 columns.
3.  **Value Domain:** The input grids contain the integers 0, 5, and 6. The output grids contain the integers 0 and 4.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves reducing the width of the grid by half while keeping the height the same. This suggests a process that relates the left half of the input grid to the right half to produce the output grid.
5.  **Core Logic:** Observing the examples, an output cell at position `(r, c)` is set to 4 if and only if the input cell at `(r, c)` (in the left half) *and* the input cell at `(r, c+4)` (in the right half) are both 0. In all other cases, the output cell at `(r, c)` is 0. The input values 5 and 6 seem to function identically in that they prevent the condition (both inputs being 0) from being met.

**Facts**

```yaml
task_description: Transform a 4x8 input grid into a 4x4 output grid based on comparing corresponding cells from the left and right halves of the input.

input_grid:
  properties:
    rows: 4
    columns: 8
    cell_values: [0, 5, 6]
  structure:
    can_be_split_into:
      - left_half:
          rows: 4
          columns: 4
          indices: (r, c) where 0 <= c < 4
      - right_half:
          rows: 4
          columns: 4
          indices: (r, c') where 4 <= c' < 8

output_grid:
  properties:
    rows: 4
    columns: 4
    cell_values: [0, 4]

transformation_rule:
  steps:
    - conceptually_split: Input grid into 'left_half' (columns 0-3) and 'right_half' (columns 4-7).
    - iterate: Through each cell position (r, c) from (0, 0) to (3, 3).
    - compare: The value of the cell 'left_half[r, c]' and 'right_half[r, c]'.
    - condition:
        if: left_half[r, c] == 0 AND right_half[r, c] == 0
        then: output_grid[r, c] = 4
        else: output_grid[r, c] = 0
  relationship: The value of output_grid[r, c] depends directly on the values of input_grid[r, c] and input_grid[r, c+4].
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty 4x4 output grid, filled with zeros.
2.  Iterate through each row `r` from 0 to 3.
3.  Inside the row loop, iterate through each column `c` from 0 to 3.
4.  For the current `(r, c)`, examine the value in the input grid at `(r, c)` (let's call this `left_value`).
5.  Examine the value in the input grid at `(r, c + 4)` (let's call this `right_value`).
6.  Check if both `left_value` is 0 AND `right_value` is 0.
7.  If the condition in step 6 is true, set the value of the output grid at position `(r, c)` to 4.
8.  If the condition in step 6 is false, the output grid value at `(r, c)` remains 0 (as initialized or explicitly set).
9.  After iterating through all `(r, c)` positions, return the completed 4x4 output grid.
