Adjacency is considered horizontal and vertical (not diagonal).\n- The spread continues iteratively until no more 7s adjacent to 3s can be converted.\n- The initial positions of 3s act as the starting points for the spread.\n- Cells containing 8 remain unchanged and block the spread of 3 through them.\n\n## Facts\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array of integers\n      - contains cells\n  - name: cell\n    properties:\n      - position: (row, column)\n      - value: integer (digit)\n  - name: digit_3\n    properties:\n      - role: source\n      - action: spreads_to_neighbors\n  - name: digit_7\n    properties:\n      - role: background\n      - state: potentially_replaceable\n  - name: digit_8\n    properties:\n      - role: barrier\n      - state: blocks_spread\nrelationships:\n  - type: adjacency\n    between: cell\n    definition: Cells sharing a horizontal or vertical edge.\n  - type: transformation\n    input: input_grid\n    output: output_grid\n    rule: fill_from_sources\nactions:\n  - name: fill_from_sources\n    actor: digit_3\n    target: adjacent digit_7 cells\n    constraint: blocked_by_digit_8\n    effect: changes target cell value from 7 to 3\n    condition: continues until no more valid targets exist\n```\n\n## Natural Language Program\n\n1.  **Initialize**: Create a copy of the input grid, which will become the output grid.\n2.  **Identify Sources**: Find the coordinates of all cells in the input grid that initially contain the digit 3.\n3.  **Prepare for Spread**: Create a queue (or similar data structure) and add the coordinates of all identified source cells to it.\n4.  **Spread Loop**: While the queue is not empty:\n    a.  **Get Current Cell**: Remove one cell's coordinates (row, col) from the front of the queue.\n    b.  **Check Neighbors**: Examine the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) of the current cell.\n    c.  **Process Neighbor**: For each valid neighbor (within grid boundaries):\n        i.  **Check if Fillable**: If the neighbor cell in the *output* grid currently contains the digit 7:\n            1.  **Fill**: Change the neighbor cell's value in the output grid to 3.\n            2.  **Add to Queue**: Add the neighbor cell's coordinates to the queue to continue the spread from this new location.\n5.  **Finalize**: Once the queue is empty (meaning no more spreading is possible), the process is complete. The modified grid is the final output."
