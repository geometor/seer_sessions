objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: rows, columns
      - contains cells
  - name: cell
    properties:
      - position: (row, column)
      - value: integer (digit)
  - name: digit_3
    properties:
      - role: source / fill_value
      - behavior: initiates and propagates fill
  - name: digit_7
    properties:
      - role: background / fillable
      - state: potentially_replaceable_by_3
      - constraint: change condition is complex and not fully captured by simple adjacency to 8s; some reachable 7s remain 7.
  - name: digit_8
    properties:
      - role: barrier
      - state: blocks_fill_propagation
      - behavior: remains unchanged
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: cell
    definition: Cells sharing a horizontal or vertical edge.
  - type: transformation
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    rule: iterative_fill_from_sources
actions:
  - name: iterative_fill_from_sources # Best current model, though imperfect
    actor: digit_3 cells (initial and newly formed)
    target: adjacent digit_7 cells
    constraint_1: cannot spread through or into digit_8 cells
    constraint_2: an unknown additional constraint prevents some reachable 7s from changing (current code overfills)
    effect: changes target cell value from 7 to 3
    condition: continues iteratively (like BFS) until no more valid targets can be changed according to the (partially unknown) constraints.
