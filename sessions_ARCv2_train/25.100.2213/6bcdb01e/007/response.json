The fill spreads like a flood fill (specifically, \nusing Breadth-First Search - BFS) to adjacent (horizontally and vertically) cells \nthat contain the digit 7. Cells containing the digit 8 act as immutable barriers, \npreventing the fill from passing through them. The process continues iteratively \nuntil no more '7' cells can be converted to '3' according to the known rules.\n\nNote: Based on comparison with provided examples, this standard flood fill \nimplementation tends to \"overfill\" the grid, converting more '7's to '3's than \nexpected. This suggests an additional, currently unidentified constraint exists \nthat prevents certain reachable '7' cells from changing. The code below implements \nthe understood BFS flood fill mechanism.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a constrained flood fill transformation to the input grid based on BFS.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A 2D list of integers representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A 2D list of integers representing the transformed grid according to the\n        understood (though potentially incomplete) BFS flood fill rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Handle empty grid case\n    if not input_grid or not input_grid[0]:\n        # Return a deep copy to maintain consistency in returning new objects\n        # For empty lists, slicing doesn't create a new object, so deepcopy is safer.\n        return copy.deepcopy(input_grid) \n\n    # Get grid dimensions\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n\n    # Initialize output_grid as a mutable copy of the input grid.\n    # List slicing [:] creates a shallow copy of the outer list, and then \n    # another [:] creates copies of the inner lists.
