"""
Transforms an input grid using a constrained iterative fill process originating from 
cells containing the digit 3. The fill spreads like a flood fill (specifically, 
using Breadth-First Search - BFS) to adjacent (horizontally and vertically) cells 
that contain the digit 7. Cells containing the digit 8 act as immutable barriers, 
preventing the fill from passing through them. The process continues iteratively 
until no more '7' cells can be converted to '3' according to the known rules.

Note: Based on comparison with provided examples, this standard flood fill 
implementation tends to "overfill" the grid, converting more '7's to '3's than 
expected. This suggests an additional, currently unidentified constraint exists 
that prevents certain reachable '7' cells from changing. The code below implements 
the understood BFS flood fill mechanism.
