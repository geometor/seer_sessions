"""
Transforms an input grid by performing a flood fill operation starting from cells containing the digit 3. 
The fill spreads to adjacent (horizontally and vertically) cells containing the digit 7. 
Cells containing the digit 8 act as barriers and block the spread. The spread continues iteratively 
until no more adjacent 7s can be reached from the spreading 3s. 
Note: This implementation represents the described flood fill but may overfill compared to expected 
outputs, indicating a missing constraint in the understanding of the transformation rule.
