objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: rows, columns (consistent between input and output)
      - contains cells
  - name: cell
    properties:
      - position: (row, column)
      - value: integer (digit 3, 7, or 8)
  - name: digit_3
    properties:
      - role: source / fill_value
      - behavior: cells with value 3 initiate and propagate a fill process.
  - name: digit_7
    properties:
      - role: background / fillable
      - state: potentially_replaceable_by_3
      - constraint: Can only be changed to 3 if it is adjacent (horizontally/vertically) to a cell that is already 3 (either from input or previously changed). However, an additional, currently unidentified constraint prevents *some* such adjacent cells from changing.
  - name: digit_8
    properties:
      - role: barrier
      - state: immutable
      - behavior: blocks the propagation of the fill; cells adjacent to 8s cannot be filled *through* the 8, and 8s themselves never change.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: cell
    definition: Cells sharing a horizontal or vertical edge are neighbors.
  - type: transformation
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    rule: constrained_iterative_fill_from_sources
actions:
  - name: constrained_iterative_fill_from_sources
    description: A process resembling flood fill (BFS) originates from initial '3' cells and attempts to spread to adjacent '7' cells.
    actor: digit_3 cells (initial and newly formed)
    target: adjacent digit_7 cells
    constraint_1: Fill cannot propagate into or through digit_8 cells.
    constraint_2: An unknown condition prevents certain reachable '7' cells from being converted to '3', even if adjacent to a '3' and not adjacent to an '8'. Simple BFS overfills the area.
    effect: If all constraints are met, the target cell's value changes from 7 to 3.
    termination: The process continues iteratively until no more '7' cells can be changed according to the full set of constraints.
