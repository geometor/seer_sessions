## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided code implements a standard Breadth-First Search (BFS) flood fill, originating from '3' cells, spreading into adjacent '7' cells, and treating '8' cells as barriers. The execution results confirm this mechanism is partially correct, as the transformation clearly involves this type of spread.

However, the consistent "overfilling" (transforming more '7's to '3's than expected) in both training examples indicates that the simple BFS rule (`if neighbor == 7, change to 3`) is incomplete. There is an additional, more subtle constraint preventing certain reachable '7' cells from changing.

Several hypotheses regarding this constraint were explored (e.g., based on adjacency to '8's in the input, distance, connectivity properties), but none fully explained why specific cells identified in the `mismatched_pixels` metrics remained '7' in the expected output while being changed to '3' by the simple BFS.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Acknowledge the Core Mechanism:** The transformation fundamentally uses a flood-fill-like propagation from '3's into '7's, blocked by '8's. This should remain the basis of the description.
2.  **Isolate the Discrepancy:** The key difference between the code's output and the expected output lies in a subset of '7' cells that are reachable by the flood fill but should *not* change. The exact condition determining this is currently unidentified.
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the Facts and Natural Language Program to accurately describe the observed BFS behavior *and* explicitly state the existence and nature of the discrepancy (the unknown constraint causing overfilling in the current model). Use the detailed metrics to pinpoint the failing cases.
4.  **Maintain Code:** The current Python code represents the best-understood approximation (BFS flood fill). Keep the code but update comments to clearly state its limitations and the observed difference from the target behavior.

## Facts

```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: rows, columns (consistent between input and output)
      - contains cells
  - name: cell
    properties:
      - position: (row, column)
      - value: integer (digit 3, 7, or 8)
      - state: mutable (if 7), immutable (if 3 or 8 from input, or if 8 generally)
  - name: digit_3
    properties:
      - role: source / fill_value
      - behavior: cells with value 3 initiate and iteratively propagate a fill process. Initial 3s remain 3.
  - name: digit_7
    properties:
      - role: background / potentially_fillable
      - state: can change to 3 under specific conditions.
      - condition_1: Must be adjacent (horizontally/vertically) to a cell that is currently 3 (either original or previously filled).
      - condition_2 (Uncertain): There exists an additional constraint, not fully identified, that prevents *some* cells satisfying condition_1 from changing to 3. Simple BFS based only on condition 1 and barrier 8 results in overfilling (see metrics). This constraint might relate to proximity to 8s in the input, local patterns, or other non-trivial properties.
  - name: digit_8
    properties:
      - role: barrier
      - state: immutable
      - behavior: blocks the propagation of the fill; the fill cannot enter or pass through an 8 cell. 8 cells in the input remain 8 in the output.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: cell
    definition: Cells sharing a horizontal or vertical edge are neighbors. Diagonal adjacency is not relevant.
  - type: transformation
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    rule: constrained_iterative_fill_from_sources
actions:
  - name: constrained_iterative_fill_from_sources
    description: A process based on Breadth-First Search (BFS) originates from initial '3' cells. It attempts to spread iteratively to adjacent '7' cells.
    actor: digit_3 cells (initial and newly formed)
    target: adjacent digit_7 cells in the evolving grid state.
    constraint_barrier: Fill cannot propagate into or through digit_8 cells.
    constraint_unknown: An additional rule prevents certain '7' cells, which are reachable via BFS and not blocked by an '8', from changing to '3'. The exact nature of this rule is not determined from the examples.
    effect: If a target '7' cell meets *all* conditions (adjacency to '3', not '8', *and* satisfies the unknown constraint), its value changes to 3.
    termination: The process continues until no more '7' cells can be changed according to the full set of rules (including the unknown constraint).
```

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize**: Create a mutable copy of the `input_grid` called `output_grid`. Initialize a queue (FIFO) data structure.
2.  **Identify Sources**: Iterate through the `input_grid`. For each cell `(r, c)` containing the digit 3, add its coordinates `(r, c)` to the queue.
3.  **Iterative Spreading (BFS)**: While the queue is not empty:
    a.  **Dequeue Cell**: Remove coordinates `(r, c)` from the front of the queue. The cell `output_grid[r][c]` is currently 3.
    b.  **Examine Neighbors**: For each neighbor `(nr, nc)` (adjacent horizontally or vertically) of the cell `(r, c)`:
        i.  **Check Bounds**: Ensure the neighbor `(nr, nc)` is within the grid boundaries.
        ii. **Check Target State**: Check if the neighbor cell `output_grid[nr][nc]` currently contains the digit 7. (This implicitly handles the barrier constraint, as '8's will not be '7').
        iii. **Apply Unknown Constraint**: Determine if the neighbor cell `(nr, nc)` satisfies the additional, currently unidentified condition required for a '7' to change to a '3'. (*Note: This check is the missing piece; simply checking for '7' as in step 3.b.ii leads to the observed overfilling.*)
        iv. **Fill and Enqueue**: If the neighbor `(nr, nc)` is within bounds, is currently '7' (step 3.b.ii), *and* satisfies the unknown constraint (step 3.b.iii):
            1.  Change the value in the output grid: `output_grid[nr][nc] = 3`.
            2.  Add the coordinates `(nr, nc)` to the queue to propagate the fill from this newly changed cell.
4.  **Finalize**: When the queue becomes empty, no more cells can be legally filled according to the full (partially unknown) rules. The current state of `output_grid` is the final result. Return `output_grid`.
