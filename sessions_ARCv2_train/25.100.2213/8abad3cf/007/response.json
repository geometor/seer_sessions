The process involves identifying two source blocks (B1, B2) \nin the input, generating the right block from B1, applying a context-dependent \ntransformation (T) to B2 to get the left block, and combining them.\n\nKey steps:\n1. Identify the least frequent color (lfc) and its minimum row index (r_min) \n   in the input grid.\n2. Calculate potential output height H based on a pattern observed in one \n   example (H = r_min - 1). Note: This height calculation is a hypothesis and \n   is known not to generalize to all provided examples. Correct dimensions \n   (H_out, W_out) ideally need to be observed from the target output.\n3. Determine the widths of the two concatenated blocks (W1 = H, W2 depends on \n   input width and a fixed column offset).\n4. Calculate the starting position (r_start, c_start) for the second source \n   block (B2) based on r_min.\n5. Extract the first source block (B1) from the input grid's top-left.\n6. Generate the right output block (OutputRight) by repeating B1's first row.\n7. Extract the second source block (B2) starting from (r_start, c_start).\n8. Apply a specific transformation T to B2 to create the left output block \n   (OutputLeft). Note: The transformation T is context-dependent; this \n   implementation uses the column swap observed in example 'train_2'.\n9. Horizontally concatenate OutputLeft and OutputRight.\n\nLimitations: This implementation assumes the output height H can be derived using \nthe 'H = r_min - 1' rule and uses the transformation T specific to 'train_2'. \nIt cannot observe the actual target output dimensions or determine the correct \ntransformation T for other instances like 'train_1'.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_least_frequent_color_and_min_row(grid: np.ndarray) -> tuple[int, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the least frequent color (smallest value in case of tie)\n    and its minimum row index in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input NumPy array.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple containing (least_frequent_color, min_row_index).\n        Returns (-1, -1) if the grid is empty or no colors are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    if grid.size == 0:\n        return -1, -1\n\n    counts = Counter(grid.flatten())\n    if not counts: \n        return -1, -1\n        \n    # Find the minimum frequency\n    min_freq = min(counts.values())\n    # Find all colors with that minimum frequency\n    least_frequent_colors = [color for color, freq in counts.items() if freq == min_freq]\n    # Tie-breaking: choose the smallest color value\n    target_color = min(least_frequent_colors)\n\n    # Find all row, col indices where the target color appears\n    indices = np.argwhere(grid == target_color)\n    if indices.size == 0:\n         # This case should ideally not happen if the Counter found the color\n         return target_color, -1 \n\n    # Find the minimum row index among these occurrences\n    min_row_index = np.min(indices[:, 0])\n    return target_color, min_row_index\n\ndef transform_b2_specific_case(block_b2: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the specific transformation T observed in 'train_2':\n    swapping columns 1 and 2 (0-indexed).\n    Returns the block unchanged if it has fewer than 3 columns.\n    \n    Note: This transformation is specific to one observed pattern and may not apply\n    to other task instances.\n\n    Args:\n        block_b2: The NumPy array representing block B2.\n\n    Returns:\n        The transformed NumPy array (OutputLeft for the 'train_2' case).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if B2 is empty or too narrow for the specific swap\n    if block_b2.size == 0 or block_b2.shape[1] < 3:\n        return block_b2.copy() # Return unchanged copy\n\n    transformed_b2 = block_b2.copy()\n    # Swap column 1 (index 1) and column 2 (index 2)\n    transformed_b2[:, [1, 2]] = transformed_b2[:, [2, 1]]\n    return transformed_b2\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:  \n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation logic based on observed patterns, primarily \n    following the rules derived from 'train_2' due to inability to observe \n    target output dimensions or determine the correct transformation T for \n    all cases.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: The input grid as a list of lists.\n\n    Returns:\n        The transformed grid as a list of lists, or an empty list if the\n        derived parameters or extraction steps fail or lead to invalid states.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Handle empty input\n    if not input_grid or not input_grid[0]:\n        return []\n\n    # Convert input to NumPy array for easier slicing and manipulation\n    input_array = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    input_height, input_width = input_array.shape\n\n    # --- Identify Least Frequent Color Info ---\n    lfc, r_min = find_least_frequent_color_and_min_row(input_array)\n    if r_min == -1:\n        # Failed to find the least frequent color or its row\n        return [] \n\n    # --- Determine Dimensions (Hypothesized based on 'train_2') ---\n    # Calculate potential output height H. \n    # !!
