The core issue lies in two key assumptions that are not universally applicable:\n\n1.  **Output Dimension Derivation:** The hypothesis that the output height `H` can be calculated as `r_min - 1` (where `r_min` is the minimum row of the least frequent color) holds for `train_2` (`H=4-1=3`) but fails for `train_1` (predicts `H=2-1=1`, while the actual output height `H_out` is 4). This indicates that the output dimensions (`H_out`, `W_out`) are likely determined by a different rule or are inherent properties of the specific task instance, which must be observed rather than calculated solely from `r_min`.\n2.  **B2 Transformation (T):** The transformation applied to the second input block (`B2`) to produce the left part of the output (`OutputLeft`) is context-dependent. While `train_2` involves swapping columns 1 and 2 of `B2`, `train_1` requires a much more complex, currently undefined transformation (`T1`).\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Acknowledge Variability:** Recognize that `H_out`, `W_out`, and the transformation `T` are not fixed but vary between examples.\n2.  **Observe, Don't Assume:** Base the description on parameters observed directly from the input/output pairs (`H_out`, `W_out`).\n3.  **Parameterize `T`:** Define the transformation `T` as a variable step, describing the specific operation observed for each example (`T_swap_cols` for `train_2`, `T_complex` for `train_1`).\n4.  **Refine Extraction Logic:** Ensure the extraction logic for `B1` and `B2` uses the *observed* `H_out` and calculated `W1`, `W2`, `r_start`, `c_start`.\n5.  **Focus on Structure:** Maintain the general structure: find `lfc`/`r_min`, calculate `r_start`/`c_start`, define `B1`/`B2` sources based on `H_out`/`W_out`, generate `OutputRight` from `B1`, apply `T` to `B2` for `OutputLeft`, concatenate.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Feature                 | `train_1` Input        | `train_1` Output | `train_1` Code Output | `train_2` Input        | `train_2` Output | `train_2` Code Output |\n| :---------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------- | :-------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------- | :-------------------- |\n| Input Dim (h x w)       | 7 x 7                  | -                | -                     | 7 x 4                  | -                | -                     |\n| Output Dim (H_out x W_out)| -                      | 4 x 10           | 1 x 7                 | -                      | 3 x 6            | 3 x 6                 |\n| Least Freq.

Calculate the width of the left block `W2` as `W_out - W1`. Ensure `W2` is not negative.\n3.  **Find Least Frequent Color Location**: Identify the digit (`lfc`) appearing least frequently in the input grid (smallest digit breaks ties). Find the minimum row index (`r_min`) of `lfc`.\n4.  **Determine B2 Start Position**: Calculate the starting row `r_start` for the second block as `r_min - 1`. The starting column `c_start` is fixed at 1.\n5.  **Extract Top-Left Input Block (B1)**: Select the subgrid `B1` from the input grid, starting at row 0, column 0, with dimensions `H_out` x `W1`. Handle cases where `H_out` or `W1` might exceed input dimensions (in which case `B1` might be smaller or empty).\n6.  **Construct Output Right Block**: If `B1` has at least one row, take its first row. Create the `OutputRight` block (size `H_out` x `W1`) by vertically repeating this first row `H_out` times. If `B1` is empty (e.g., `W1=0`), `OutputRight` is an empty block of size `H_out` x 0.\n7.  **Extract Second Input Block (B2)**: Select the subgrid `B2` from the input grid, starting at row `r_start`, column `c_start`, with dimensions `H_out` x `W2`. Carefully handle boundary conditions: if `r_start` is negative, or if `r_start + H_out` exceeds input height, or `c_start + W2` exceeds input width, or if `W2` is zero or less, the extraction might yield an empty block (`H_out` x 0) or be considered invalid depending on exact boundary conditions. Assume valid extraction yields a block of size `H_out` x `W2`.\n8.  **Transform B2 into Output Left Block (Apply T)**: Apply a specific transformation `T` to `B2` to create the `OutputLeft` block (size `H_out` x `W2`). This transformation `T` *depends on the specific problem instance*.\n    *   For the instance shown in `train_1`, apply transformation `T1` (a complex operation specific to this example).\n    *   For the instance shown in `train_2`, apply transformation `T2` (swap the columns at index 1 and index 2 within `B2`, if `W2` is 3 or more).\n    If `B2` is empty, `OutputLeft` is also empty (`H_out` x 0).\n9.  **Combine Output Blocks**: Horizontally concatenate the `OutputLeft` block and the `OutputRight` block, in that order, to form the final output grid of size `H_out` x `W_out`.\n\nThis revised program accurately describes the observed process for both examples while explicitly acknowledging the variability in output dimensions and the transformation rule `T`."
