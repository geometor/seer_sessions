Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output:** The input is a rectangular grid of digits. The output is also a rectangular grid of digits, but generally with different dimensions than the input.
2.  **Color Palette:** The digits (colors) used in the output are a subset of those present in the input.
3.  **Structure:** The output grid appears to be composed of two distinct rectangular blocks concatenated horizontally.
    *   The **right block** seems simpler, often consisting of a single digit repeated to fill its dimensions. Its width appears equal to the output grid's height.
    *   The **left block** seems more complex, derived from a specific region of the input grid, potentially involving transformations like selection or rearrangement. Its width is the total output width minus the width of the right block.
4.  **Block Identification:**
    *   The content of the **right block** seems related to the top-left portion of the input grid. Specifically, it looks like the first row of the top-left subgrid (matching the right block's dimensions) is repeated vertically.
    *   The location of the subgrid used to derive the **left block** seems related to the position of the least frequently occurring digit in the input grid. The transformation applied to this input subgrid to get the left output block varies between the examples (e.g., column swapping in `train_2`, a more complex change in `train_1`).
5.  **Dimensions:** Let the output grid have height `H` and width `W`. The right block seems to have dimensions `H x H`, and the left block has dimensions `H x (W - H)`. The input subgrid used for the right block is `input[0:H, 0:H]`. The input subgrid (`B2`) used for the left block also seems to have height `H` and width `(W - H)`. Its starting row appears related to the minimum row index of the least frequent digit, and its starting column seems fixed (e.g., column index 1).

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Determine Output Grid Parameters**: Observe the output grid to find its height `H` and total width `W`.
2.  **Define Block Dimensions**: Calculate the width of the right block `W1` as `H`, and the width of the left block `W2` as `W - H`.
3.  **Extract Top-Left Input Block (B1)**: Select the subgrid from the input grid starting at row 0, column 0, with height `H` and width `W1`. Call this block `B1`.
4.  **Construct Output Right Block**: Take the first row of `B1`. Create the `OutputRight` block (size `H` x `W1`) by vertically repeating this first row `H` times.
5.  **Locate Second Input Block (B2) Origin**:
    a. Find the digit value (color) that appears least frequently in the entire input grid.
    b. Find the lowest row index (`r_min`) where this least frequent color appears.
    c. Calculate the starting row for `B2` as `r_start = r_min - 1`.
    d. Set the starting column for `B2` as `c_start = 1`.
6.  **Extract Second Input Block (B2)**: Select the subgrid from the input grid starting at row `r_start`, column `c_start`, with height `H` and width `W2`. Call this block `B2`. (Ensure indices stay within input grid bounds).
7.  **Transform B2 into Output Left Block**: Apply a transformation rule to `B2` to create the `OutputLeft` block (size `H` x `W2`). (Note: The exact transformation rule observed differs between examples; one case involves swapping columns 1 and 2 of `B2`).
8.  **Combine Output Blocks**: Concatenate the `OutputLeft` block and the `OutputRight` block horizontally in that order to form the final output grid.
