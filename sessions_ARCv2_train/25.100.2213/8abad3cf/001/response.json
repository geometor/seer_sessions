The 'train_1' example follows\n# significantly different rules for determining dimensions (H, W) and for transforming\n# the second block (B2), indicating this logic is not general across all examples.\n# This implementation attempts to capture the specific pattern observed in 'train_2'.\n\n\"\"\"\nTransform the input grid based on the location of its least frequent color, following a pattern observed in one specific example (train_2).\n\n1. Convert the input list of lists grid to a NumPy array.\n2. Find the color (digit) that appears least frequently in the entire grid. If there's a tie in frequency, choose the smallest color value.\n3. Find the minimum row index (r_min) where this least frequent color first appears.\n4. Determine the height (H) for constructing output blocks, hypothesized as r_min - 1. If H <= 0, the rule is considered inapplicable.\n5. Define the starting column index (c_start) for extracting the second input block (B2) as 1.\n6. Calculate the width (W2) of the second block (B2) as the input grid's width minus c_start.\n7. Set the width (W1) of the first block (B1) equal to H.\n8. Extract the top-left subgrid B1 from the input array, with dimensions H x W1 (input_array[0:H, 0:W1]). Handle boundary conditions.\n9. Create the right part of the output grid (OutputRight) by taking the first row of B1 and repeating it vertically H times. OutputRight has dimensions H x W1.\n10. Define the starting row index (r_start) for extracting B2 as r_min - 1 (which equals H).\n11. Extract the subgrid B2 from the input array, starting at (r_start, c_start) with dimensions H x W2 (input_array[r_start : r_start+H, c_start : c_start+W2]). Handle boundary conditions.\n12. Transform B2 to create the left part of the output grid (OutputLeft). The specific transformation observed in train_2 involves swapping the second and third columns of B2 (0-indexed columns 1 and 2). If B2 has fewer than 3 columns, it remains unchanged.\n13. Horizontally concatenate OutputLeft and OutputRight to form the final output NumPy array.\n14. Convert the final NumPy array back to a list of lists.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_least_frequent_color_and_min_row(grid: np.ndarray) -> tuple[int, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the least frequent color (smallest value in case of tie)\n    and its minimum row index in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input NumPy array.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple containing (least_frequent_color, min_row_index).\n        Returns (-1, -1) if the grid is empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    if grid.size == 0:\n        return -1, -1\n\n    counts = Counter(grid.flatten())\n    if not counts: # Check if counter is empty (e.g., grid was empty)\n        return -1, -1\n        \n    min_freq = min(counts.values())\n    # Get all colors with the minimum frequency\n    least_frequent_colors = [color for color, freq in counts.items() if freq == min_freq]\n    # Tie-breaking: choose the smallest color value\n    target_color = min(least_frequent_colors)\n\n    # Find all indices where the target color appears\n    indices = np.argwhere(grid == target_color)\n    if indices.size == 0:\n         # This case should theoretically not be reached if Counter found the color\n         return target_color, -1 # Indicate color found, but index finding failed\n\n    # Find the minimum row index among these occurrences\n    min_row_index = np.min(indices[:, 0])\n    return target_color, min_row_index\n\ndef transform_b2(block_b2: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms Block B2 by swapping columns 1 and 2 (0-indexed).\n    If the block has fewer than 3 columns, it's returned unchanged.\n\n    Args:\n        block_b2: The NumPy array representing block B2.\n\n    Returns:\n        The transformed NumPy array.\n    \"\"\"\n    transformed_b2 = block_b2.copy()\n    # Check if there are at least 3 columns to perform the swap\n    if transformed_b2.shape[1] >= 3:\n        # Swap column 1 (index 1) and column 2 (index 2)\n        transformed_b2[:, [1, 2]] = transformed_b2[:, [2, 1]]\n    return transformed_b2\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the rules derived primarily from example train_2.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid of digits.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed output grid.
