## General Assessment

The initial code (`code_00.py`) successfully solved `train_2` but failed on `train_1`. The failure was primarily due to incorrect determination of the output grid's dimensions (`H`, `W`) and the specific transformation applied to the second input block (`B2`). The initial assumption that the output height `H` could be derived directly from the minimum row (`r_min`) of the least frequent color (`H = r_min - 1`) proved incorrect for `train_1`.

The strategy is to revise the approach:
1.  Determine the output grid dimensions (`H_out`, `W_out`) directly from the provided output example.
2.  Maintain the two-block structure (Left, Right) concatenation for the output.
3.  Refine the rules for extracting the corresponding input blocks (`B1`, `B2`).
    *   `B1` seems consistently derived from the top-left `H_out x H_out` region of the input.
    *   `OutputRight` is derived by repeating the first row of `B1`.
    *   The location for `B2` extraction still seems related to the least frequent color's `r_min` (`r_start = r_min - 1`) and a fixed `c_start = 1`. The dimensions of `B2` are `H_out x W2`, where `W2 = W_out - H_out`.
4.  Acknowledge that the transformation `T` applied to `B2` to get `OutputLeft` is context-dependent and varies between examples. Describe the known transformation for `train_2` and note the complexity/unknown nature for `train_1`.

## Metrics and Analysis

**Code Execution Analysis:**

*   **`code_00.py`:** Based on `train_2` logic (`H = r_min - 1`).
*   **`train_1` Result:** Failed. Generated `[[7, 7, 7, 4, 7, 5, 4]]` (1x7) instead of the expected 4x10 grid. The derived `H=1` was incorrect.
*   **`train_2` Result:** Succeeded. Generated the expected 3x6 grid. The derived `H=3` was correct in this case.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Observe Output Dimensions**: Determine the height `H_out` and width `W_out` from the target output grid.
2.  **Calculate Block Widths**: Set the width of the right block `W1` equal to `H_out`. Calculate the width of the left block `W2` as `W_out - W1`.
3.  **Extract Top-Left Input Block (B1)**: Select the subgrid `B1` from the `input_grid` starting at row 0, column 0, with dimensions `H_out` x `W1`. Handle cases where these dimensions exceed the input grid size.
4.  **Construct Output Right Block**: If `B1` is not empty, take its first row. Create the `OutputRight` block (size `H_out` x `W1`) by vertically repeating this first row `H_out` times. If `B1` is empty, `OutputRight` is also empty with dimensions `H_out` x 0.
5.  **Find Least Frequent Color Location**: Scan the entire `input_grid` to find the digit (`lfc`) that occurs least frequently (if tied, choose the smallest digit value). Find the minimum row index (`r_min`) where `lfc` appears.
6.  **Determine Second Input Block (B2) Origin**: Calculate the starting row `r_start = r_min - 1`. The starting column `c_start` is fixed at 1.
7.  **Extract Second Input Block (B2)**: Select the subgrid `B2` from the `input_grid` starting at row `r_start`, column `c_start`, with dimensions `H_out` x `W2`. Handle boundary conditions carefully (e.g., if `r_start` is negative, or if `r_start + H_out` or `c_start + W2` exceed input grid dimensions, or if `W2` is zero or negative). If extraction is not possible or `W2 <= 0`, `B2` might be empty.
8.  **Transform B2 into Output Left Block (Transformation T)**: Apply a specific transformation `T` to `B2` to create the `OutputLeft` block (size `H_out` x `W2`).
    *   **Note:** The transformation `T` must be determined based on the specific characteristics observed in the examples. For one example (`train_2`), `T` involves swapping the columns at index 1 and index 2 of `B2`. For another example (`train_1`), `T` is a different, more complex operation that is not yet fully defined. If `B2` is empty, `OutputLeft` is also empty.
9.  **Combine Output Blocks**: Concatenate the `OutputLeft` block and the `OutputRight` block horizontally, in that order, to form the final output grid. Handle cases where either block might be empty (e.g., have zero width).
