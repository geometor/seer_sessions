Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output:** The input is a rectangular grid of digits. The output is also a rectangular grid of digits, but generally with different dimensions than the input.
2.  **Color Palette:** The digits (colors) used in the output are a subset of those present in the input.
3.  **Structure:** The output grid appears to be composed of two distinct rectangular blocks concatenated horizontally.
    *   The **right block** seems simpler, often consisting of a single digit repeated to fill its dimensions. Its width appears equal to the output grid's height.
    *   The **left block** seems more complex, derived from a specific region of the input grid, potentially involving transformations like selection or rearrangement. Its width is the total output width minus the width of the right block.
4.  **Block Identification:**
    *   The content of the **right block** seems related to the top-left portion of the input grid. Specifically, it looks like the first row of the top-left subgrid (matching the right block's dimensions) is repeated vertically.
    *   The location of the subgrid used to derive the **left block** seems related to the position of the least frequently occurring digit in the input grid. The transformation applied to this input subgrid to get the left output block varies between the examples (e.g., column swapping in `train_2`, a more complex change in `train_1`).
5.  **Dimensions:** Let the output grid have height `H` and width `W`. The right block seems to have dimensions `H x H`, and the left block has dimensions `H x (W - H)`. The input subgrid used for the right block is `input[0:H, 0:H]`. The input subgrid (`B2`) used for the left block also seems to have height `H` and width `(W - H)`. Its starting row appears related to the minimum row index of the least frequent digit, and its starting column seems fixed (e.g., column index 1).

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Determine Output Grid Parameters**: Observe the output grid to find its height `H` and total width `W`.
2.  **Define Block Dimensions**: Calculate the width of the right block `W1` as `H`, and the width of the left block `W2` as `W - H`.
3.  **Extract Top-Left Input Block (B1)**: Select the subgrid from the input grid starting at row 0, column 0, with height `H` and width `W1`. Call this block `B1`.
4.  **Construct Output Right Block**: Take the first row of `B1`. Create the `OutputRight` block (size `H` x `W1`) by vertically repeating this first row `H` times.
5.  **Locate Second Input Block (B2) Origin**:
    a. Find the digit value (color) that appears least frequently in the entire input grid.
    b. Find the lowest row index (`r_min`) where this least frequent color appears.
    c. Calculate the starting row for `B2` as `r_start = r_min - 1`.
    d. Set the starting column for `B2` as `c_start = 1`.
6.  **Extract Second Input Block (B2)**: Select the subgrid from the input grid starting at row `r_start`, column `c_start`, with height `H` and width `W2`. Call this block `B2`. (Ensure indices stay within input grid bounds).
7.  **Transform B2 into Output Left Block**: Apply a transformation rule to `B2` to create the `OutputLeft` block (size `H` x `W2`). (Note: The exact transformation rule observed differs between examples; one case involves swapping columns 1 and 2 of `B2`).
8.  **Combine Output Blocks**: Concatenate the `OutputLeft` block and the `OutputRight` block horizontally in that order to form the final output grid.

# Note: The natural language description and the implemented logic below are primarily
# based on reverse-engineering the 'train_2' example. The 'train_1' example follows
# significantly different rules for determining dimensions (H, W) and for transforming
# the second block (B2), indicating this logic is not general across all examples.
# This implementation attempts to capture the specific pattern observed in 'train_2'.

"""
Transform the input grid based on the location of its least frequent color, following a pattern observed in one specific example (train_2).

1. Convert the input list of lists grid to a NumPy array.
2. Find the color (digit) that appears least frequently in the entire grid. If there's a tie in frequency, choose the smallest color value.
3. Find the minimum row index (r_min) where this least frequent color first appears.
4. Determine the height (H) for constructing output blocks, hypothesized as r_min - 1. If H <= 0, the rule is considered inapplicable.
5. Define the starting column index (c_start) for extracting the second input block (B2) as 1.
6. Calculate the width (W2) of the second block (B2) as the input grid's width minus c_start.
7. Set the width (W1) of the first block (B1) equal to H.
8. Extract the top-left subgrid B1 from the input array, with dimensions H x W1 (input_array[0:H, 0:W1]). Handle boundary conditions.
9. Create the right part of the output grid (OutputRight) by taking the first row of B1 and repeating it vertically H times. OutputRight has dimensions H x W1.
10. Define the starting row index (r_start) for extracting B2 as r_min - 1 (which equals H).
11. Extract the subgrid B2 from the input array, starting at (r_start, c_start) with dimensions H x W2 (input_array[r_start : r_start+H, c_start : c_start+W2]). Handle boundary conditions.
12. Transform B2 to create the left part of the output grid (OutputLeft). The specific transformation observed in train_2 involves swapping the second and third columns of B2 (0-indexed columns 1 and 2). If B2 has fewer than 3 columns, it remains unchanged.
13. Horizontally concatenate OutputLeft and OutputRight to form the final output NumPy array.
14. Convert the final NumPy array back to a list of lists.
