"""
Transforms an input grid into an output grid based on a hypothesis derived primarily from the second training example ('train_2').

The transformation involves identifying two blocks in the input grid based on the location of the least frequent color and predefined rules, transforming these blocks, and concatenating them horizontally.

Specifically:
1. Find the least frequent color (digit) in the input grid (smallest value breaks ties).
2. Find the minimum row index (r_min) where this color appears.
3. Hypothesize the output grid's height (H) as r_min - 1. If H <= 0, the transformation is considered inapplicable.
4. Define the width of the right output block (W1) as H.
5. Define the width of the left output block (W2) based on the remaining width of the input grid after a fixed column offset (c_start = 1). W2 = input_width - c_start.
6. The source block for the right output (B1) is the top-left H x W1 subgrid of the input.
7. The right output block (OutputRight) is generated by repeating the first row of B1 vertically H times.
8. The source block for the left output (B2) starts at row r_start = r_min - 1 and column c_start = 1, with dimensions H x W2.
9. The left output block (OutputLeft) is generated by applying a transformation T to B2. Based on 'train_2', T involves swapping columns 1 and 2 of B2 (if B2 has at least 3 columns).
10. The final output is the horizontal concatenation of OutputLeft and OutputRight.

Note: This logic successfully reproduces 'train_2' but fails on 'train_1', indicating that the rules for determining dimensions (H, W_out) and the transformation T for B2 are not universally applicable and likely depend on context not fully captured by this hypothesis. This implementation follows the 'train_2' pattern.
