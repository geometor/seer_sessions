Find the least frequent color (digit) in the input grid (smallest value breaks ties).\n2. Find the minimum row index (r_min) where this color appears.\n3. Hypothesize the output grid's height (H) as r_min - 1. If H <= 0, the transformation is considered inapplicable.\n4. Define the width of the right output block (W1) as H.\n5. Define the width of the left output block (W2) based on the remaining width of the input grid after a fixed column offset (c_start = 1). W2 = input_width - c_start.\n6. The source block for the right output (B1) is the top-left H x W1 subgrid of the input.\n7. The right output block (OutputRight) is generated by repeating the first row of B1 vertically H times.\n8. The source block for the left output (B2) starts at row r_start = r_min - 1 and column c_start = 1, with dimensions H x W2.\n9. The left output block (OutputLeft) is generated by applying a transformation T to B2. Based on 'train_2', T involves swapping columns 1 and 2 of B2 (if B2 has at least 3 columns).\n10. The final output is the horizontal concatenation of OutputLeft and OutputRight.\n\nNote: This logic successfully reproduces 'train_2' but fails on 'train_1', indicating that the rules for determining dimensions (H, W_out) and the transformation T for B2 are not universally applicable and likely depend on context not fully captured by this hypothesis. This implementation follows the 'train_2' pattern.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_least_frequent_color_and_min_row(grid: np.ndarray) -> tuple[int, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the least frequent color (smallest value in case of tie)\n    and its minimum row index in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input NumPy array.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple containing (least_frequent_color, min_row_index).\n        Returns (-1, -1) if the grid is empty or no colors are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    if grid.size == 0:\n        return -1, -1\n\n    counts = Counter(grid.flatten())\n    if not counts: # Check if counter is empty\n        return -1, -1\n        \n    min_freq = min(counts.values())\n    # Get all colors with the minimum frequency\n    least_frequent_colors = [color for color, freq in counts.items() if freq == min_freq]\n    # Tie-breaking: choose the smallest color value\n    target_color = min(least_frequent_colors)\n\n    # Find all indices where the target color appears\n    indices = np.argwhere(grid == target_color)\n    if indices.size == 0:\n         # Should not happen if Counter found the color, but safeguard\n         return target_color, -1 \n\n    # Find the minimum row index among these occurrences\n    min_row_index = np.min(indices[:, 0])\n    return target_color, min_row_index\n\ndef transform_b2_specific(block_b2: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the specific transformation observed in 'train_2' to Block B2:\n    swapping columns 1 and 2 (0-indexed).\n    If the block has fewer than 3 columns, it's returned unchanged.\n\n    Args:\n        block_b2: The NumPy array representing block B2.\n\n    Returns:\n        The transformed NumPy array.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if B2 is empty or has fewer than 3 columns\n    if block_b2.size == 0 or block_b2.shape[1] < 3:\n        return block_b2.copy() # Return a copy to avoid modifying original\n\n    transformed_b2 = block_b2.copy()\n    # Swap column 1 (index 1) and column 2 (index 2)\n    transformed_b2[:, [1, 2]] = transformed_b2[:, [2, 1]]\n    return transformed_b2\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on the rules derived primarily from example 'train_2'.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid of digits.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed output grid.
