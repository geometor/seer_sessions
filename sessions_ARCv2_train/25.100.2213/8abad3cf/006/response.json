            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code execution results confirm the previous analysis: the transformation logic derived solely from `train_2` is not general enough to solve `train_1`. The core discrepancies lie in:\n\n1.  **Output Dimension Determination:** The rule `H_out = r_min - 1` used to determine the output height works for `train_2` but fails for `train_1`. This strongly suggests that the output dimensions (`H_out`, `W_out`) are either intrinsic properties of the specific task instance (and must be observed from the output example) or are determined by a more complex rule not yet identified. The current code cannot \"see\" the example output, hence its failure on `train_1`.\n2.  **Block B2 Transformation (T):** The transformation applied to the input block `B2` to create `OutputLeft` is different in the two examples. The code implemented the column swap observed in `train_2` (`T2`), which is incorrect for `train_1` (`T1`).\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\nThe natural language program and supporting facts must be updated to reflect these observations:\n\n1.  Treat `H_out` and `W_out` as parameters *observed* from the example output, not calculated from `r_min`.\n2.  Define the extraction of input blocks `B1` and `B2` based on these observed `H_out` and calculated `W1 = H_out`, `W2 = W_out - W1`.\n3.  Explicitly state that the transformation `T` applied to `B2` is context-dependent and varies between instances, providing the specific descriptions for `T1` (complex, undefined details) and `T2` (column swap) as observed.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Feature                 | `train_1` Input        | `train_1` Output | `train_1` Code Output | `train_2` Input        | `train_2` Output | `train_2` Code Output | Analysis Notes                                     |\n| :---------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------- | :-------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |\n| Input Dim (h x w)       | 7 x 7                  | -                | -                     | 7 x 4                  | -                | -                     |                                                    |\n| Output Dim (H_out x W_out)| -                      | **4 x 10**       | 1 x 7                 | -                      | **3 x 6**        | 3 x 6                 | Code failed size prediction for train_1.             |\n| Least Freq.

Calculate the width `W2` of the left output block as `W2 = W_out - W1`. Ensure `W2` is not negative.\n3.  **Locate Least Frequent Color**: Identify the digit (`lfc`) that appears least frequently in the entire input grid. If there's a tie in frequency, select the smallest digit value. Find the minimum row index (`r_min`, 0-based) where `lfc` occurs in the input grid.\n4.  **Determine Second Block's Origin**: Calculate the starting row index `r_start` for the second source block `B2` as `r_start = r_min - 1`. The starting column index `c_start` is fixed at 1.\n5.  **Extract First Source Block (B1)**: From the `input_grid`, extract the subgrid `B1` starting at row 0, column 0, with dimensions `H_out` x `W1`. Handle boundary conditions (e.g., if `H_out` or `W1` exceed input dimensions).\n6.  **Generate Right Output Block (OutputRight)**: If `B1` contains any rows, take the first row of `B1`. Create the `OutputRight` block (size `H_out` x `W1`) by vertically repeating this first row `H_out` times. If `B1` is empty (e.g., `W1=0`), `OutputRight` is an empty block of size `H_out` x 0.\n7.  **Extract Second Source Block (B2)**: From the `input_grid`, extract the subgrid `B2` starting at row `r_start`, column `c_start`, with dimensions `H_out` x `W2`. Manage boundary conditions carefully: if `r_start` is negative, if `r_start + H_out` or `c_start + W2` go beyond the input grid's bounds, or if `W2` is zero or less, the result `B2` should be an appropriately sized empty block (e.g., `H_out` x 0).\n8.  **Apply Instance-Specific Transformation (T) to B2**: Transform the extracted block `B2` into the `OutputLeft` block (size `H_out` x `W2`) using a transformation rule `T` that is specific to the particular task instance.\n    *   For the instance represented by `train_1`, apply a specific, complex transformation `T1`.\n    *   For the instance represented by `train_2`, apply transformation `T2`: if `B2` has 3 or more columns (`W2 >= 3`), swap its second and third columns (indices 1 and 2); otherwise, use `B2` as is.\n    If `B2` was empty, `OutputLeft` is also empty (`H_out` x 0).\n9.  **Combine Output Blocks**: Horizontally concatenate the `OutputLeft` block and the `OutputRight` block, in that sequence, to construct the final `output_grid` of size `H_out` x `W_out`."
