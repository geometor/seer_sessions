*   **Perception:** The task takes a square grid of single-digit integers as input and produces a smaller square grid of integers as output. The size of the output grid appears to depend on the size of the input grid. The content of the output grid seems related to a frequently occurring subgrid pattern within the input grid. Specifically, it looks like we need to find the most common square subgrid of a particular size, handle ties by location, and then potentially extract a portion of that subgrid based on the input grid's dimensions.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task: find_most_frequent_subgrid_pattern
    
    objects:
      - input_grid:
          type: 2D array of integers
          properties:
            - dimension (Dim): size of one side (e.g., 4 for 4x4)
            - cells: contain single-digit integers
      - subgrid:
          type: 2D array of integers
          properties:
            - dimension (M): size determined by floor(sqrt(Dim))
            - pattern: the specific values within the subgrid
            - location: top-left (row, col) index within the input_grid
            - frequency: count of occurrences of the pattern in the input_grid
            - index_sum: sum of the row and column index of the location
      - output_grid:
          type: 2D array of integers
          properties:
            - dimension (N): size determined by M and Dim's parity (N=M//2 if Dim is even, N=M if Dim is odd)
            - content: derived from the selected most frequent subgrid pattern
    
    actions:
      - calculate_subgrid_dimension (M): compute floor(sqrt(input_grid.dimension))
      - extract_subgrids: find all M x M subgrids within the input_grid
      - count_frequencies: determine how many times each unique M x M pattern occurs
      - find_max_frequency: identify the highest frequency count
      - filter_most_frequent: select all subgrid patterns that have the max_frequency
      - select_target_pattern (P):
          if only one pattern has max_frequency: select it
          if multiple patterns have max_frequency:
              find all occurrences (locations) for these patterns
              calculate index_sum (row + col) for each occurrence
              select the pattern associated with the occurrence having the maximum index_sum
              (tie-break further using max row index, then max col index if necessary)
      - calculate_output_dimension (N):
          if input_grid.dimension is even: N = M // 2
          if input_grid.dimension is odd: N = M
      - extract_output: take the top-left N x N portion of the selected_target_pattern (P)
    
    relationships:
      - subgrids are parts of the input_grid
      - output_grid is derived from the selected_target_pattern (P)
      - output_grid.dimension depends on subgrid.dimension (M) and input_grid.dimension (Dim)
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the dimension (`Dim`) of the input square grid.
    2.  Calculate the dimension (`M`) for the subgrid search window by taking the floor of the square root of `Dim`.
    3.  Identify all unique `M x M` subgrid patterns present in the input grid and count the frequency of each pattern. Record the top-left location(s) (row, col) for each occurrence of every pattern.
    4.  Find the maximum frequency among all patterns.
    5.  Select the pattern(s) that occur with this maximum frequency.
    6.  If only one pattern has the maximum frequency, designate this pattern as `P`.
    7.  If multiple patterns share the maximum frequency, examine all occurrences (locations) of these tied patterns. Calculate the sum of indices (row + col) for each occurrence. Select the pattern (`P`) corresponding to the occurrence with the highest index sum. (If there's still a tie in index sums, choose the one with the highest row index; if still tied, choose the one with the highest column index).
    8.  Determine the dimension (`N`) of the output grid: if `Dim` (the input dimension) is even, set `N = M // 2`; otherwise (if `Dim` is odd), set `N = M`.
    9.  Construct the output grid by taking the top-left `N x N` portion of the selected pattern `P`.

This function transforms an input square grid of integers into an output square grid.
The transformation involves finding the most frequent square subgrid of a specific size within the input grid.

1.  Determine the dimension (`Dim`) of the input square grid.
2.  Calculate the subgrid dimension (`M`) as floor(sqrt(Dim)).
3.  Extract all M x M subgrids from the input grid, counting the frequency of each unique pattern and recording the top-left location(s) of each occurrence.
4.  Find the maximum frequency among all patterns.
5.  Identify all patterns that occur with this maximum frequency.
6.  If only one pattern has the maximum frequency, select it.
7.  If multiple patterns tie for maximum frequency, select the pattern whose occurrence has the highest index sum (row + col). Use the highest row index, then the highest column index as further tie-breakers.
8.  Determine the output grid dimension (`N`): N = M // 2 if Dim is even, N = M if Dim is odd.
9.  Construct the output grid by taking the top-left N x N portion of the selected pattern.

## General Assessment

The previous transformation rule, based on finding the *most frequent* `M x M` subgrid (where `M = floor(sqrt(Dim))`) and using lexicographical tie-breaking, correctly solved Example 1 but failed on Examples 2 and 3. The subsequent analysis using index sum tie-breaking also failed.

The key issues identified were:
1.  **Selection Criterion:** Relying purely on frequency was incorrect, especially for Example 3 where the expected output pattern was not among the most frequent.
2.  **Tie-breaking:** Lexicographical and simple index-sum tie-breaking rules did not select the correct pattern when multiple candidates existed (Example 2).

The strategy is to revise the pattern selection process. The analysis suggests a multi-stage filtering and tie-breaking approach: prioritizing patterns by the sum of their elements, then by frequency, and finally using a location-based tie-breaker (maximum row index, then maximum column index). The output grid size `N` calculation (based on input dimension parity) and the extraction method (top-left `N x N`) appear consistent across examples once the correct pattern is selected.

## Metrics and Analysis

Metrics were gathered using `tool_code` to analyze the subgrids, frequencies, locations, and sums for each example.

**Example 1:**
*   Dim=4, M=2, N=1 (Dim is even)
*   Patterns: `((8, 6), (6, 8))` (Freq 4, Sum 28), `((6, 8), (8, 6))` (Freq 3, Sum 28), `((6, 0), (8, 6))` (Freq 1, Sum 20), `((0, 6), (6, 8))` (Freq 1, Sum 20)
*   Max Sum = 28. Patterns: `((8, 6), (6, 8))`, `((6, 8), (8, 6))`
*   Max Freq among max-sum = 4. Pattern: `((8, 6), (6, 8))`
*   Selection: `((8, 6), (6, 8))`
*   Output: Top-left 1x1 is `[[8]]`. Matches expected.

**Example 2:**
*   Dim=5, M=2, N=2 (Dim is odd)
*   Patterns: Various, all with Sum=5. Max Sum = 5.
*   Max Freq among max-sum = 3. Tied Patterns (Freq 3): `P1=((1, 1), (1, 2))`, `P2=((1, 1), (2, 1))`, `P3=((1, 2), (1, 1))`, `P4=((2, 1), (1, 1))`
*   Tie-breaking (Max Row, Max Col Location):
    *   P1 Max Loc: (3, 3)
    *   P2 Max Loc: (3, 2)
    *   P3 Max Loc: (2, 3)
    *   P4 Max Loc: (2, 2)
    *   Comparing locations using (row, col) max: (3, 3) wins. Belongs to P1. **Wait, previous thought process used Max Row, Min Col, which selected P2. Let's re-verify Max Row, Max Col.**
    *   Max Row is 3 (P1, P2). Comparing (3,3) and (3,2). Max Col is 3. Location (3,3) wins. Belongs to P1=`((1, 1), (1, 2))`.
*   Selection: `((1, 1), (1, 2))`
*   Output: Top-left 2x2 is `[[1, 1], [1, 2]]`. **Does NOT match expected `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`**. My previous derivation that "Max Row, Max Col" worked was incorrect, it seems "Max Row, Min Col" worked for Ex2. Let's stick with "Max Row, Max Col" for now as it seemed necessary for Ex3. The failure here needs reconsideration.

**Example 3:**
*   Dim=7, M=2, N=2 (Dim is odd)
*   Patterns: Various sums. Max Sum = 17.
*   Max Sum Patterns (Sum 17, Freq 3): `P_2555=((2, 5), (5, 5))`, `P_5255=((5, 2), (5, 5))`, `P_5525=((5, 5), (2, 5))`, `P_5552=((5, 5), (5, 2))`
*   Max Freq among max-sum = 3. All four patterns remain tied.
*   Tie-breaking (Max Row, Max Col Location):
    *   P_2555 Max Loc: (4, 1)
    *   P_5255 Max Loc: (4, 2)
    *   P_5525 Max Loc: (5, 1)
    *   P_5552 Max Loc: (5, 2)
    *   Comparing locations using (row, col) max: (5, 2) wins. Belongs to P_5552=`((5, 5), (5, 2))`.
*   Selection: `((5, 5), (5, 2))`
*   Output: Top-left 2x2 is `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`. Matches expected.

**Revisiting Example 2 Failure:**
The rule "Max Sum -> Max Freq -> Max Row, Max Col Location" failed for Example 2, selecting P1 `((1, 1), (1, 2))` instead of the expected P2 `((1, 1), (2, 1))`. P1 won the location tie-break with (3,3) over P2's (3,2).

What if the location tie-breaker is different?
*   Max Row, Min Col: Selects P2 (loc 3,2). Works for Ex2. Fails Ex3 (selects P_5525 at loc 5,1).
*   Min Row, Min Col: Selects P4 (loc 0,0). Fails Ex2.
*   Min Row, Max Col: Selects P3 (loc 0,3). Fails Ex2.

It seems impossible to find a *single* location tie-breaking rule (based on min/max row/col) that works for both Ex2 and Ex3 within the "Max Sum -> Max Freq" framework.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** Could the tie-breaking involve the pattern itself?
Let's re-examine the tie in Ex2 (Patterns P1, P2, P3, P4 all have Max Sum 5, Max Freq 3):
P1=`((1, 1), (1, 2))`
P2=`((1, 1), (2, 1))` - Expected
P3=`((1, 2), (1, 1))`
P4=`((2,
