"""
This function transforms an input square grid of integers into an output square grid.
The transformation involves finding the most frequent square subgrid of a specific size within the input grid.

1.  Determine the dimension (`Dim`) of the input square grid.
2.  Calculate the subgrid dimension (`M`) as floor(sqrt(Dim)).
3.  Extract all M x M subgrids from the input grid, counting the frequency of each unique pattern and recording the top-left location(s) of each occurrence.
4.  Find the maximum frequency among all patterns.
5.  Identify all patterns that occur with this maximum frequency.
6.  If only one pattern has the maximum frequency, select it.
7.  If multiple patterns tie for maximum frequency, select the pattern whose occurrence has the highest index sum (row + col). Use the highest row index, then the highest column index as further tie-breakers.
8.  Determine the output grid dimension (`N`): N = M // 2 if Dim is even, N = M if Dim is odd.
9.  Construct the output grid by taking the top-left N x N portion of the selected pattern.
