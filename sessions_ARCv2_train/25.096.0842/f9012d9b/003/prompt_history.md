*   **Perception:** The task takes a square grid of single-digit integers as input and produces a smaller square grid of integers as output. The size of the output grid appears to depend on the size of the input grid. The content of the output grid seems related to a frequently occurring subgrid pattern within the input grid. Specifically, it looks like we need to find the most common square subgrid of a particular size, handle ties by location, and then potentially extract a portion of that subgrid based on the input grid's dimensions.

*   **Facts:**

    objects:
      - input_grid:
          type: 2D array of integers
          properties:
            - dimension (Dim): size of one side (e.g., 4 for 4x4)
            - cells: contain single-digit integers
      - subgrid:
          type: 2D array of integers
          properties:
            - dimension (M): size determined by floor(sqrt(Dim))
            - pattern: the specific values within the subgrid
            - location: top-left (row, col) index within the input_grid
            - frequency: count of occurrences of the pattern in the input_grid
            - index_sum: sum of the row and column index of the location
      - output_grid:
          type: 2D array of integers
          properties:
            - dimension (N): size determined by M and Dim's parity (N=M//2 if Dim is even, N=M if Dim is odd)
            - content: derived from the selected most frequent subgrid pattern
    
    actions:
      - calculate_subgrid_dimension (M): compute floor(sqrt(input_grid.dimension))
      - extract_subgrids: find all M x M subgrids within the input_grid
      - count_frequencies: determine how many times each unique M x M pattern occurs
      - find_max_frequency: identify the highest frequency count
      - filter_most_frequent: select all subgrid patterns that have the max_frequency
      - select_target_pattern (P):
          if only one pattern has max_frequency: select it
          if multiple patterns have max_frequency:
              find all occurrences (locations) for these patterns
              calculate index_sum (row + col) for each occurrence
              select the pattern associated with the occurrence having the maximum index_sum
              (tie-break further using max row index, then max col index if necessary)
      - calculate_output_dimension (N):
          if input_grid.dimension is even: N = M // 2
          if input_grid.dimension is odd: N = M
      - extract_output: take the top-left N x N portion of the selected_target_pattern (P)
    
    relationships:
      - subgrids are parts of the input_grid
      - output_grid is derived from the selected_target_pattern (P)
      - output_grid.dimension depends on subgrid.dimension (M) and input_grid.dimension (Dim)

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the dimension (`Dim`) of the input square grid.
    2.  Calculate the dimension (`M`) for the subgrid search window by taking the floor of the square root of `Dim`.
    3.  Identify all unique `M x M` subgrid patterns present in the input grid and count the frequency of each pattern. Record the top-left location(s) (row, col) for each occurrence of every pattern.
    4.  Find the maximum frequency among all patterns.
    5.  Select the pattern(s) that occur with this maximum frequency.
    6.  If only one pattern has the maximum frequency, designate this pattern as `P`.
    7.  If multiple patterns share the maximum frequency, examine all occurrences (locations) of these tied patterns. Calculate the sum of indices (row + col) for each occurrence. Select the pattern (`P`) corresponding to the occurrence with the highest index sum. (If there's still a tie in index sums, choose the one with the highest row index; if still tied, choose the one with the highest column index).
    8.  Determine the dimension (`N`) of the output grid: if `Dim` (the input dimension) is even, set `N = M // 2`; otherwise (if `Dim` is odd), set `N = M`.
    9.  Construct the output grid by taking the top-left `N x N` portion of the selected pattern `P`.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial hypothesis, based on Example 1, involved finding the most frequent `M x M` subgrid (where `M = floor(sqrt(Dim))`), using the maximum index sum of any occurrence as a tie-breaker, and extracting the top-left `N x N` portion (where `N = M // 2` if Dim is even, `N = M` if Dim is odd).

Testing against Examples 2 and 3 revealed inaccuracies:
1.  **Example 2 Failure:** The max index sum tie-breaker selected the wrong pattern among those with maximum frequency.
2.  **Example 3 Failure:** The max index sum tie-breaker selected the wrong pattern. Furthermore, the *expected* output pattern in Example 3 did not even have the maximum frequency found in the input grid.

Several alternative hypotheses were tested:
*   Tie-breaking frequency ties using min/max index sum of first/last occurrences.
*   Tie-breaking frequency ties using lexicographical order of the pattern tuples.
*   Selecting the pattern found at the location with the overall maximum index sum (regardless of frequency).
*   Calculating `M` using `ceil(sqrt(Dim))` instead of `floor`.

The hypothesis that correctly solved Examples 1 and 2 was:
1.  Calculate `M = floor(sqrt(Dim))`.
2.  Find all `M x M` patterns and their frequencies.
3.  Identify the maximum frequency (`max_freq`).
4.  Select the set `S` of patterns with `count == max_freq`.
5.  If `len(S) > 1`, choose the pattern `P` from `S` that is lexicographically smallest. Otherwise, `P` is the single pattern in `S`.
6.  Calculate `N = M // 2` if Dim is even, else `N = M`.
7.  Output the top-left `N x N` portion of `P`.

This hypothesis still fails Example 3. The expected pattern `((5,5),(5,2))` has frequency 3, while the maximum frequency is 4. The hypothesis selects `((2,2),(2,2))` (lexicographically smallest among freq 4 patterns).

**Strategy:**
Refine the description based on the "Max Frequency, Lexicographical Tie-break" hypothesis, as it provides the best fit for the first two examples. Explicitly note the failure in Example 3 and the contradiction where the expected pattern is not among the most frequent, suggesting a more complex selection rule or a conditional modification for certain inputs might be necessary.
