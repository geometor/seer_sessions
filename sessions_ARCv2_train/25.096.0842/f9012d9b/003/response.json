Determining the input grid dimension `Dim`.\n2. Calculating the subgrid dimension `M = floor(sqrt(Dim))`.\n3. Finding all unique `M x M` subgrid patterns within the input grid and counting their frequencies.\n4. Identifying the maximum frequency (`max_freq`) among all patterns.\n5. Selecting all patterns that occur with `max_freq`.\n6. If multiple patterns tie for the maximum frequency, choosing the pattern that is lexicographically smallest (treating patterns as tuples of tuples).\n7. Determining the output grid dimension `N`: `N = M // 2` if `Dim` is even, otherwise `N = M`.\n8. Constructing the output grid by taking the top-left `N x N` portion of the selected pattern.\n\nNote: This rule correctly explains examples 1 and 2. Example 3 deviates, as its expected output derives from a pattern that is *not* among the most frequent in the input grid according to this rule.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _extract_and_count_subgrids(grid: list[list[int]], m: int) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Extracts all M x M subgrids, counts their frequencies, and records locations.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input 2D list of integers.\n        m: The dimension of the subgrids to extract.\n\n    Returns:\n        A dictionary where keys are tuple representations of subgrid patterns\n        and values are dictionaries containing 'count'.\n        Example: { ((1,2),(3,4)): {'count': 2} } \n        (Locations are not needed for this specific hypothesis but kept in internal thought process)\n    \"\"\"\n    dim = len(grid)\n    pattern_data = defaultdict(lambda: {'count': 0}) # Simplified for this hypothesis\n\n    # Basic validation\n    if m <= 0 or m > dim: \n        return {}\n\n    # Iterate through possible top-left corners of M x M subgrids\n    for r in range(dim - m + 1):\n        for c in range(dim - m + 1):\n            # Extract the M x M subgrid\n            subgrid_rows = []\n            for i in range(m):\n                # Extract row segment for the subgrid\n                subgrid_rows.append(tuple(grid[r + i][c : c + m]))\n            \n            # Use the tuple of row tuples as the pattern key\n            pattern_tuple = tuple(subgrid_rows)\n            \n            # Update count\n            pattern_data[pattern_tuple]['count'] += 1\n            \n    return dict(pattern_data) # Convert back to regular dict\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
