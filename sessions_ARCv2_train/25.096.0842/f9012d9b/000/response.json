The size of the output grid appears to depend on the size of the input grid. The content of the output grid seems related to a frequently occurring subgrid pattern within the input grid. Specifically, it looks like we need to find the most common square subgrid of a particular size, handle ties by location, and then potentially extract a portion of that subgrid based on the input grid's dimensions.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
