## General Assessment

The previous transformation rule, based on finding the *most frequent* `M x M` subgrid (where `M = floor(sqrt(Dim))`) and using lexicographical tie-breaking, correctly solved Example 1 but failed on Examples 2 and 3. The subsequent analysis using index sum tie-breaking also failed.

The key issues identified were:
1.  **Selection Criterion:** Relying purely on frequency was incorrect, especially for Example 3 where the expected output pattern was not among the most frequent.
2.  **Tie-breaking:** Lexicographical and simple index-sum tie-breaking rules did not select the correct pattern when multiple candidates existed (Example 2).

The strategy is to revise the pattern selection process. The analysis suggests a multi-stage filtering and tie-breaking approach: prioritizing patterns by the sum of their elements, then by frequency, and finally using a location-based tie-breaker (maximum row index, then maximum column index). The output grid size `N` calculation (based on input dimension parity) and the extraction method (top-left `N x N`) appear consistent across examples once the correct pattern is selected.

## Metrics and Analysis

Metrics were gathered using `tool_code` to analyze the subgrids, frequencies, locations, and sums for each example.

**Example 1:**
*   Dim=4, M=2, N=1 (Dim is even)
*   Patterns: `((8, 6), (6, 8))` (Freq 4, Sum 28), `((6, 8), (8, 6))` (Freq 3, Sum 28), `((6, 0), (8, 6))` (Freq 1, Sum 20), `((0, 6), (6, 8))` (Freq 1, Sum 20)
*   Max Sum = 28. Patterns: `((8, 6), (6, 8))`, `((6, 8), (8, 6))`
*   Max Freq among max-sum = 4. Pattern: `((8, 6), (6, 8))`
*   Selection: `((8, 6), (6, 8))`
*   Output: Top-left 1x1 is `[[8]]`. Matches expected.

**Example 2:**
*   Dim=5, M=2, N=2 (Dim is odd)
*   Patterns: Various, all with Sum=5. Max Sum = 5.
*   Max Freq among max-sum = 3. Tied Patterns (Freq 3): `P1=((1, 1), (1, 2))`, `P2=((1, 1), (2, 1))`, `P3=((1, 2), (1, 1))`, `P4=((2, 1), (1, 1))`
*   Tie-breaking (Max Row, Max Col Location):
    *   P1 Max Loc: (3, 3)
    *   P2 Max Loc: (3, 2)
    *   P3 Max Loc: (2, 3)
    *   P4 Max Loc: (2, 2)
    *   Comparing locations using (row, col) max: (3, 3) wins. Belongs to P1. **Wait, previous thought process used Max Row, Min Col, which selected P2. Let's re-verify Max Row, Max Col.**
    *   Max Row is 3 (P1, P2). Comparing (3,3) and (3,2). Max Col is 3. Location (3,3) wins. Belongs to P1=`((1, 1), (1, 2))`.
*   Selection: `((1, 1), (1, 2))`
*   Output: Top-left 2x2 is `[[1, 1], [1, 2]]`. **Does NOT match expected `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`**. My previous derivation that "Max Row, Max Col" worked was incorrect, it seems "Max Row, Min Col" worked for Ex2. Let's stick with "Max Row, Max Col" for now as it seemed necessary for Ex3. The failure here needs reconsideration.

**Example 3:**
*   Dim=7, M=2, N=2 (Dim is odd)
*   Patterns: Various sums. Max Sum = 17.
*   Max Sum Patterns (Sum 17, Freq 3): `P_2555=((2, 5), (5, 5))`, `P_5255=((5, 2), (5, 5))`, `P_5525=((5, 5), (2, 5))`, `P_5552=((5, 5), (5, 2))`
*   Max Freq among max-sum = 3. All four patterns remain tied.
*   Tie-breaking (Max Row, Max Col Location):
    *   P_2555 Max Loc: (4, 1)
    *   P_5255 Max Loc: (4, 2)
    *   P_5525 Max Loc: (5, 1)
    *   P_5552 Max Loc: (5, 2)
    *   Comparing locations using (row, col) max: (5, 2) wins. Belongs to P_5552=`((5, 5), (5, 2))`.
*   Selection: `((5, 5), (5, 2))`
*   Output: Top-left 2x2 is `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`. Matches expected.

**Revisiting Example 2 Failure:**
The rule "Max Sum -> Max Freq -> Max Row, Max Col Location" failed for Example 2, selecting P1 `((1, 1), (1, 2))` instead of the expected P2 `((1, 1), (2, 1))`. P1 won the location tie-break with (3,3) over P2's (3,2).

What if the location tie-breaker is different?
*   Max Row, Min Col: Selects P2 (loc 3,2). Works for Ex2. Fails Ex3 (selects P_5525 at loc 5,1).
*   Min Row, Min Col: Selects P4 (loc 0,0). Fails Ex2.
*   Min Row, Max Col: Selects P3 (loc 0,3). Fails Ex2.

It seems impossible to find a *single* location tie-breaking rule (based on min/max row/col) that works for both Ex2 and Ex3 within the "Max Sum -> Max Freq" framework.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** Could the tie-breaking involve the pattern itself?
Let's re-examine the tie in Ex2 (Patterns P1, P2, P3, P4 all have Max Sum 5, Max Freq 3):
P1=`((1, 1), (1, 2))`
P2=`((1, 1), (2, 1))` - Expected
P3=`((1, 2), (1, 1))`
P4=`((2,
