"""
Transforms an input square grid of integers into an output square grid by:
1. Determining the input grid dimension `Dim`.
2. Calculating the subgrid dimension `M = floor(sqrt(Dim))`.
3. Finding all unique `M x M` subgrid patterns within the input grid and counting their frequencies.
4. Identifying the maximum frequency (`max_freq`) among all patterns.
5. Selecting all patterns that occur with `max_freq`.
6. If multiple patterns tie for the maximum frequency, choosing the pattern that is lexicographically smallest (treating patterns as tuples of tuples).
7. Determining the output grid dimension `N`: `N = M // 2` if `Dim` is even, otherwise `N = M`.
8. Constructing the output grid by taking the top-left `N x N` portion of the selected pattern.

Note: This rule correctly explains examples 1 and 2. Example 3 deviates, as its expected output derives from a pattern that is *not* among the most frequent in the input grid according to this rule.
