This suggests a scaling factor of 3 in both height and width.\n3.  **Block Structure:** The output grid appears to be composed of 3x3 blocks, where each block corresponds to a single cell in the input grid. The block at output rows `3*r` to `3*r+2` and columns `3*c` to `3*c+2` seems related to the input cell at `(r, c)`.\n4.  **Value Mapping:** The content of each 3x3 output block seems determined by the *value* of the corresponding input cell.\n    *   An input value of `0` consistently results in a 3x3 output block filled entirely with `0`s.\n    *   An input value of `3` consistently results in a 3x3 output block filled entirely with `3`s.\n    *   An input value of `2` consistently results in a specific 3x3 output block:\n        "
