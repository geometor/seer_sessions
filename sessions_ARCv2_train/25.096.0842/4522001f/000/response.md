Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids of single digits.
2.  **Dimensionality Change:** The input grid is 3x3, and the output grid is 9x9. This suggests a scaling factor of 3 in both height and width.
3.  **Block Structure:** The output grid appears to be composed of 3x3 blocks, where each block corresponds to a single cell in the input grid. The block at output rows `3*r` to `3*r+2` and columns `3*c` to `3*c+2` seems related to the input cell at `(r, c)`.
4.  **Value Mapping:** The content of each 3x3 output block seems determined by the *value* of the corresponding input cell.
    *   An input value of `0` consistently results in a 3x3 output block filled entirely with `0`s.
    *   An input value of `3` consistently results in a 3x3 output block filled entirely with `3`s.
    *   An input value of `2` consistently results in a specific 3x3 output block:
        
```
        3 3 0
        3 3 0
        3 3 0
        ```

5.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation involves replacing each input cell with a predefined 3x3 pattern determined by the input cell's value. The position of the input cell dictates the position of the corresponding 3x3 block in the larger output grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new 9x9 grid, initially empty or filled with a default value (like 0).
2.  For each cell in the 3x3 input grid, located at row `r` (from 0 to 2) and column `c` (from 0 to 2):
    a.  Read the integer value `v` from the input cell `input[r][c]`.
    b.  Determine the 3x3 pattern corresponding to the value `v`:
        i.  If `v` is 0, the pattern is a 3x3 grid of 0s.
        ii. If `v` is 3, the pattern is a 3x3 grid of 3s.
        iii. If `v` is 2, the pattern is `[[3, 3, 0], [3, 3, 0], [3, 3, 0]]`.
    c.  Calculate the top-left corner `(R, C)` of the corresponding block in the output grid: `R = 3 * r`, `C = 3 * c`.
    d.  Copy the determined 3x3 pattern into the output grid, starting at position `(R, C)` and filling the block up to `(R+2, C+2)`.
3.  Return the completed 9x9 output grid.
