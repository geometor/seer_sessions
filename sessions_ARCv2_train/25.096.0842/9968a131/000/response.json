Some rows remain identical, while others are modified.\n4.  **Pattern based on Row Index:** In both examples, rows with even indices (0, 2, ...) in the input grid appear unchanged in the output grid. Rows with odd indices (1, 3, ...) are transformed.\n5.  **Transformation Type:** For the rows that *are* changed (odd-indexed rows), the transformation appears to be a right circular shift (or rotation) of the elements within that row. The last element moves to the first position, and all other elements shift one position to the right.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
