task_description: Modifies specific rows of a 2D integer grid based on their index.
elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - content: single-digit integers
  - object: row
    properties:
      - type: 1D array (list) of integers
      - property: index (position within the grid, 0-based)
      - property: elements (the integers in the row)
  - object: index
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - property: parity (even or odd)

actions:
  - name: iterate_rows
    actor: system
    target: input_grid
    purpose: Process each row individually.
  - name: check_parity
    actor: system
    target: row_index
    purpose: Determine if the row index is even or odd.
  - name: copy_row
    actor: system
    source: input_row
    destination: output_row
    condition: Row index is even.
  - name: rotate_row_right
    actor: system
    target: input_row
    result: modified_row (stored in output_row)
    condition: Row index is odd.
    details: The last element becomes the first, others shift right.

relationships:
  - type: containment
    parent: grid
    child: row
  - type: determination
    condition: row_index_parity
    action: copy_row (if even) or rotate_row_right (if odd)
