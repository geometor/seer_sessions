Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are structured as 2D grids (or matrices) of single-digit integers.
2.  **Dimensionality:** The dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the output grid are identical to the input grid in both examples.
3.  **Row-based Transformation:** The changes between input and output seem to occur row by row. Some rows remain identical, while others are modified.
4.  **Pattern based on Row Index:** In both examples, rows with even indices (0, 2, ...) in the input grid appear unchanged in the output grid. Rows with odd indices (1, 3, ...) are transformed.
5.  **Transformation Type:** For the rows that *are* changed (odd-indexed rows), the transformation appears to be a right circular shift (or rotation) of the elements within that row. The last element moves to the first position, and all other elements shift one position to the right.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Modifies specific rows of a 2D integer grid based on their index.
elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - content: single-digit integers
  - object: row
    properties:
      - type: 1D array (list) of integers
      - property: index (position within the grid, 0-based)
      - property: elements (the integers in the row)
  - object: index
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - property: parity (even or odd)

actions:
  - name: iterate_rows
    actor: system
    target: input_grid
    purpose: Process each row individually.
  - name: check_parity
    actor: system
    target: row_index
    purpose: Determine if the row index is even or odd.
  - name: copy_row
    actor: system
    source: input_row
    destination: output_row
    condition: Row index is even.
  - name: rotate_row_right
    actor: system
    target: input_row
    result: modified_row (stored in output_row)
    condition: Row index is odd.
    details: The last element becomes the first, others shift right.

relationships:
  - type: containment
    parent: grid
    child: row
  - type: determination
    condition: row_index_parity
    action: copy_row (if even) or rotate_row_right (if odd)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the row's index (starting from 0).
2.  For each row, check if its index is even or odd.
3.  If the row index is even, copy the row directly from the input grid to the corresponding row in the output grid without any changes.
4.  If the row index is odd, perform a right circular shift on the elements of the row: move the last element to the first position and shift all other elements one position to the right. Place this modified row in the corresponding row of the output grid.
5.  The final output grid consists of these processed rows.
