Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input is consistently a grid of numbers with 3 rows and 6 columns.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output is consistently a grid of numbers with 3 rows and 3 columns.
3.  **Number Values:** The input grids contain the numbers 0, 3, and 4. The output grids contain the numbers 0 and 6.
4.  **Transformation:** There appears to be a spatial relationship between the input and output. The 3x6 input grid seems to be processed in a way that collapses or combines information into the smaller 3x3 output grid.
5.  **Core Logic:** By comparing the input and output grids positionally, it seems the output grid's value at a specific coordinate `(row, col)` depends on the values at `(row, col)` and `(row, col + 3)` in the input grid. Specifically, if the value at `(row, col)` in the input is 4 OR the value at `(row, col + 3)` is 3, the corresponding output value at `(row, col)` becomes 6. Otherwise, it is 0.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
task_description: Map a 3x6 input grid to a 3x3 output grid based on specific value conditions.
components:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 3
      columns: 6
      cell_values: [0, 3, 4]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 3
      columns: 3
      cell_values: [0, 6]
relationships:
  - type: spatial_mapping
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    details: The output grid corresponds spatially to the left half (first 3 columns) of the input grid.
actions:
  - name: determine_output_cell_value
    inputs:
      - input_grid_cell_left: Value at input_grid[row][col]
      - input_grid_cell_right: Value at input_grid[row][col + 3]
    output:
      - output_grid_cell: Value at output_grid[row][col]
    condition: >
      IF input_grid_cell_left is 4 OR input_grid_cell_right is 3
      THEN output_grid_cell is 6
      ELSE output_grid_cell is 0.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty 3x3 output grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell of the output grid, using row index `r` (from 0 to 2) and column index `c` (from 0 to 2).
3.  For the current cell `(r, c)` in the output grid:
    a.  Get the value from the input grid at the same position `(r, c)`. Let's call this `left_value`.
    b.  Get the value from the input grid at the position shifted three columns to the right, `(r, c + 3)`. Let's call this `right_value`.
    c.  Check if `left_value` is equal to 4 OR `right_value` is equal to 3.
    d.  If the condition in step (c) is true, set the value of the output grid cell `(r, c)` to 6.
    e.  Otherwise (if the condition is false), set the value of the output grid cell `(r, c)` to 0.
4.  Return the completed 3x3 output grid.
