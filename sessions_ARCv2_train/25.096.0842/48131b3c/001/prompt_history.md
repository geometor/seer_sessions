Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input:** The input is a square grid of integers. Each grid contains exactly two distinct integer values: zero (0) and one non-zero integer (e.g., 7, 8, 4). The size of the input grid varies across examples (2x2, 3x3, 4x4).
2.  **Output:** The output is also a square grid of integers, containing the same two distinct integer values as the input grid.
3.  **Dimensions:** The output grid's dimensions (height and width) are exactly double the dimensions of the corresponding input grid. If the input is HxW, the output is 2Hx2W.
4.  **Pattern:** The output grid appears to be constructed by taking a transformed version of the input grid and tiling it in a 2x2 arrangement.
5.  **Transformation within Tiling:** The core transformation seems to involve swapping the roles of the zero and the non-zero number present in the input grid. A temporary grid is created where every 0 in the input becomes the non-zero number, and every non-zero number in the input becomes 0. This temporary grid is then used as the tile to create the larger output grid.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D list or array of integers
      - shape: square (H x H)
      - contains: two distinct integers (zero and one non-zero value 'N')
  - name: intermediate_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D list or array of integers
      - shape: same as input_grid (H x H)
      - derivation: created by swapping 0 and N in the input_grid
  - name: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D list or array of integers
      - shape: square (2H x 2H)
      - derivation: created by tiling the intermediate_grid in a 2x2 pattern

actions:
  - name: identify_non_zero
    input: input_grid
    output: the non-zero integer value 'N'
  - name: swap_values
    input: input_grid, non_zero_value 'N'
    output: intermediate_grid
    description: Iterate through each cell of the input_grid. If the cell value is 0, set the corresponding cell in the intermediate_grid to N. If the cell value is N, set the corresponding cell in the intermediate_grid to 0.
  - name: tile_grid
    input: intermediate_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Create a new grid with dimensions double that of the intermediate_grid. Fill the output_grid by repeating the intermediate_grid twice horizontally and twice vertically.

relationships:
  - output_grid dimensions are double the input_grid dimensions.
  - output_grid values are determined by a 2x2 tiling of the intermediate_grid.
  - intermediate_grid is derived from input_grid by swapping the zero and non-zero values.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
3.  Identify the unique non-zero integer value ('N') present in the input grid.
4.  Create a new intermediate grid with the same dimensions (H x W) as the input grid.
5.  Iterate through each cell (at row `r`, column `c`) of the input grid:
    *   If the value in the input grid at `input_grid[r][c]` is 0, set the value in the intermediate grid at `intermediate_grid[r][c]` to 'N'.
    *   If the value in the input grid at `input_grid[r][c]` is 'N', set the value in the intermediate grid at `intermediate_grid[r][c]` to 0.
6.  Create the final output grid with dimensions (2H x 2W).
7.  Populate the output grid by tiling the intermediate grid: For each cell (at row `r`, column `c`) in the output grid, its value is determined by the cell in the intermediate grid at `intermediate_grid[r % H][c % W]`.
8.  Return the output grid.
