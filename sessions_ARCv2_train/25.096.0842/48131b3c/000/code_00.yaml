objects:
  - name: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D list or array of integers
      - shape: square (H x H)
      - contains: two distinct integers (zero and one non-zero value 'N')
  - name: intermediate_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D list or array of integers
      - shape: same as input_grid (H x H)
      - derivation: created by swapping 0 and N in the input_grid
  - name: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D list or array of integers
      - shape: square (2H x 2H)
      - derivation: created by tiling the intermediate_grid in a 2x2 pattern

actions:
  - name: identify_non_zero
    input: input_grid
    output: the non-zero integer value 'N'
  - name: swap_values
    input: input_grid, non_zero_value 'N'
    output: intermediate_grid
    description: Iterate through each cell of the input_grid. If the cell value is 0, set the corresponding cell in the intermediate_grid to N. If the cell value is N, set the corresponding cell in the intermediate_grid to 0.
  - name: tile_grid
    input: intermediate_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Create a new grid with dimensions double that of the intermediate_grid. Fill the output_grid by repeating the intermediate_grid twice horizontally and twice vertically.

relationships:
  - output_grid dimensions are double the input_grid dimensions.
  - output_grid values are determined by a 2x2 tiling of the intermediate_grid.
  - intermediate_grid is derived from input_grid by swapping the zero and non-zero values.
