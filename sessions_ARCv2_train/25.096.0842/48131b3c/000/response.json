Each grid contains exactly two distinct integer values: zero (0) and one non-zero integer (e.g., 7, 8, 4). The size of the input grid varies across examples (2x2, 3x3, 4x4).\n2.  **Output:** The output is also a square grid of integers, containing the same two distinct integer values as the input grid.\n3.  **Dimensions:** The output grid's dimensions (height and width) are exactly double the dimensions of the corresponding input grid. If the input is HxW, the output is 2Hx2W.\n4.  **Pattern:** The output grid appears to be constructed by taking a transformed version of the input grid and tiling it in a 2x2 arrangement.\n5.  **Transformation within Tiling:** The core transformation seems to involve swapping the roles of the zero and the non-zero number present in the input grid. A temporary grid is created where every 0 in the input becomes the non-zero number, and every non-zero number in the input becomes 0. This temporary grid is then used as the tile to create the larger output grid.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
