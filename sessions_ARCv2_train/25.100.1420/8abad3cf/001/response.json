            "text": "*perception:*\nThe input is a 2D grid of integers. The output is also a 2D grid of integers, typically smaller than the input. The transformation seems to involve identifying a specific region within the input grid, extracting it, and then rotating it. The region appears to be defined by the elements that are *not* the most frequent element in the input grid. The rotation applied is 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n\n*facts:*\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: input_grid\n    type: 2D list of integers\n  - name: output_grid\n    type: 2D list of integers\n  - name: most_frequent_element\n    type: integer\n    description: The integer that appears most often in the input_grid.\n  - name: target_subgrid\n    type: 2D list of integers\n    description: The smallest rectangular subgrid within input_grid containing all elements not equal to the most_frequent_element.\n\nactions:\n  - name: find_most_frequent_element\n    input: input_grid\n    output: most_frequent_element\n  - name: identify_target_subgrid_bounds\n    input: input_grid, most_frequent_element\n    output: min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col\n    description: Find the top-left and bottom-right corners of the target_subgrid.\n  - name: extract_subgrid\n    input: input_grid, min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col\n    output: target_subgrid\n  - name: rotate_subgrid\n    input: target_subgrid\n    output: rotated_subgrid\n    description: Rotate the target_subgrid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n\nrelationships:\n  - The output_grid is the result of rotating the target_subgrid.\n  - The target_subgrid contains all elements from the input_grid that are different from the most_frequent_element.\n  - The dimensions of the output_grid depend on the dimensions of the target_subgrid after rotation.\n```\n\n*natural_language_program:*\n1. Determine the most frequent integer value within the input grid.\n2. Identify the coordinates of all cells in the input grid that do *not* contain the most frequent integer.\n3. Find the minimum bounding box (smallest rectangle) that encloses all these identified cells.\n4. Extract the subgrid defined by this bounding box from the input grid.\n5. Rotate the extracted subgrid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n6. The resulting rotated subgrid is the output grid.\n\n*python_code:*\n```python\n\"\"\"\nTransforms the input grid by finding the most frequent element, identifying the \nbounding box of all other elements, extracting this subgrid, and rotating it \n90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the subgrid containing non-most-frequent elements, extracts it, \n    rotates it 90 degrees counter-clockwise, and returns the result.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input 2D grid of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed 2D grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to a numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n\n    # Find the most frequent element\n    # Flatten the grid, count element occurrences, and find the most common one\n    counts = Counter(grid.flatten())\n    # Handle cases where the grid might be empty or have multiple most frequent elements (takes the first one)\n    if not counts:\n        return [] # Return empty list for empty input\n    most_frequent_element = counts.most_common(1)[0][0]\n\n    # Find the indices of elements *not* equal to the most frequent element\n    non_frequent_indices = np.argwhere(grid != most_frequent_element)\n\n    # If all elements are the same, there's nothing to extract/rotate\n    if non_frequent_indices.size == 0:\n         # Determine behavior for grids with only one type of element.\n         # Based on examples, seems like it should return an empty grid or handle based on specific rules not fully clear yet.\n         # Let's return an empty grid for now.\n         return []\n\n\n    # Determine the bounding box of these elements\n    min_row = np.min(non_frequent_indices[:, 0])\n    max_row = np.max(non_frequent_indices[:, 0])\n    min_col = np.min(non_frequent_indices[:, 1])\n    max_col = np.max(non_frequent_indices[:, 1])\n\n    # Extract the subgrid defined by the bounding box\n    # Note: slicing includes the start index but excludes the end index, so add 1 to max values\n    subgrid = grid[min_row : max_row + 1, min_col : max_col + 1]\n\n    # Rotate the extracted subgrid 90 degrees counter-clockwise\n    # k=1 specifies one counter-clockwise rotation\n    rotated_subgrid = np.rot90(subgrid, k=1)\n\n    # Convert the resulting numpy array back to a list of lists\n    output_grid = rotated_subgrid.tolist()\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
