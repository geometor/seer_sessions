**INSTRUCTIONS**

above is an example pair for a task

this is your opportunity to perceive the underlying logic that transforms the
input into the output

respond with the following deliverables:

- your perception of the elements of the task
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, actions performed on them, and the relationships between them
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.


your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a conversation*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are 2D grids (matrices) of integers.
    *   The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the dimensions of the input grid.
    *   The transformation operates on a row-by-row basis.
    *   A distinction is made between rows based on their index (position) within the grid. Rows with even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) appear unchanged. Rows with odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) are modified.
    *   For rows with odd indices, the modification consists of a right circular shift of the elements within that row. The last element moves to the first position, and all other elements shift one position to the right.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    input_object: grid_of_integers
    output_object: grid_of_integers
    properties:
      - grid_dimensions: preserved
      - element_type: integer
    actions:
      - name: conditional_row_modification
        condition: row_index is odd
        transformation: right_circular_shift
        target: elements_within_the_row
      - name: identity_transformation
        condition: row_index is even
        target: row
    relationships:
      - input_row[i] maps to output_row[i]
      - transformation_depends_on: row_index_parity
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the row index (starting from 0).
    2.  Check if the current row index is even or odd.
    3.  If the row index is even, copy the row directly from the input to the corresponding row in the output grid.
    4.  If the row index is odd, perform a right circular shift on the elements of the input row: move the last element to the first position and shift all other elements one position to the right. Place the resulting shifted row into the corresponding row of the output grid.
    5.  Return the completed output grid.
