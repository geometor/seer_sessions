*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are 2D grids (matrices) of integers.
    *   The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the dimensions of the input grid.
    *   The transformation operates on a row-by-row basis.
    *   A distinction is made between rows based on their index (position) within the grid. Rows with even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) appear unchanged. Rows with odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) are modified.
    *   For rows with odd indices, the modification consists of a right circular shift of the elements within that row. The last element moves to the first position, and all other elements shift one position to the right.

*   **Facts:**

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the row index (starting from 0).
    2.  Check if the current row index is even or odd.
    3.  If the row index is even, copy the row directly from the input to the corresponding row in the output grid.
    4.  If the row index is odd, perform a right circular shift on the elements of the input row: move the last element to the first position and shift all other elements one position to the right. Place the resulting shifted row into the corresponding row of the output grid.
    5.  Return the completed output grid.
