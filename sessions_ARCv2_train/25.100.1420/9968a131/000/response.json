Rows with even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) appear unchanged. Rows with odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) are modified.\n    *   For rows with odd indices, the modification consists of a right circular shift of the elements within that row. The last element moves to the first position, and all other elements shift one position to the right.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
