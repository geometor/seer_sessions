task_description: Analyze the input grid based on the frequencies and connectivity of its two non-zero colors to determine the output grid.
observations:
  - Grids contain integers, with 0 typically acting as a background or ignored color.
  - All training examples feature exactly two unique non-zero colors.
  - The output grid size is either 1x1 or 2x2.
properties:
  - colors: The set of unique non-zero integer values in the grid.
  - frequency: The count of each non-zero color.
  - connectivity: Whether cells of the minimum color (defined by frequency/value) are orthogonally adjacent.
  - c_min: The non-zero color identified as 'minimum' based on frequency (lower) or value (lower if frequencies tied).
  - c_max: The non-zero color identified as 'maximum' based on frequency (higher) or value (higher if frequencies tied).
rules:
  - rule_1x1:
      condition: Frequencies of the two non-zero colors differ AND c_min cells are not connected.
      output: '[[c_min]]'
  - rule_2x2_diff_freq:
      condition: Frequencies of the two non-zero colors differ AND c_min cells are connected.
      output: '[[c_max, c_max], [c_min, c_max]]'
  - rule_2x2_tied_freq:
      condition: Frequencies of the two non-zero colors are tied.
      output: '[[c_max, c_max], [c_max, c_min]]'
uncertainty:
  - The execution report showed discrepancies for train_2 and train_3 compared to the expected output and the logic of the previous code attempt. The refined hypothesis assumes the report was faulty for those cases and relies on the logic matching the expected outputs.
