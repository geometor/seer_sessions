**INSTRUCTIONS**

You are the 'Dreamer' agent. A previous attempt to solve the ARC task using a generated `transform` function failed or produced incorrect results for some examples.

Review the following:
1.  The original task pairs.
2.  The previously generated code.
3.  The execution report showing inputs, expected outputs, and the actual (incorrect) outputs from the code.

Identify why the code failed. Was the initial hypothesis incorrect? Was the implementation flawed? Did it miss an edge case or pattern visible in other examples?

Respond with the following deliverables:

- A concise analysis of the failure points based on the report.
- A refined hypothesis and natural language program describing the corrected or improved transformation rule.
- An updated YAML block documenting key facts, incorporating insights from the failed examples.

**Original Task Pairs:**

## train_1

**input:**
```
8 6 0 6
6 8 6 8
8 6 8 6
6 8 6 8
```


**output:**
```
8
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
2 1 2 1 2
1 1 1 1 1
2 1 2 1 2
0 0 1 1 1
0 0 2 1 2
```


**output:**
```
1 1
2 1
```


## train_3

**input:**
```
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
5 5 5 5 5 5 5
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
5 5 5 5 5 0 0
2 2 5 2 2 0 0
```


**output:**
```
5 5
5 2
```

 

**Previous Code:**
```python
import math
import copy
from collections import Counter

def transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
    """
    Transforms the input grid based on the following hypothesized rule:

    1. Analyze frequencies of the two non-zero colors present.
    2. Determine the 'minimum' color (C_min) and 'maximum' color (C_max):
       - If frequencies differ, C_min has lower frequency, C_max has higher frequency.
       - If frequencies are tied, C_min has lower value, C_max has higher value.
    3. Check if any C_min cells are adjacent (N,S,E,W) to other C_min cells in the grid.
    4. Determine output size and content:
       - If frequencies differ AND C_min cells are NOT connected, output is 1x1: [[C_min]].
       - Otherwise (frequencies tied OR C_min cells are connected), output is 2x2:
         - If frequencies differed: [[C_max, C_max], [C_min, C_max]]
         - If frequencies were tied: [[C_max, C_max], [C_max, C_min]]
