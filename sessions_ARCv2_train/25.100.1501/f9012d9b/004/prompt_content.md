**INSTRUCTIONS**

You are the 'Dreamer' agent. A previous attempt to solve the ARC task using a generated `transform` function failed or produced incorrect results for some examples.

Review the following:
1.  The original task pairs.
2.  The previously generated code.
3.  The execution report showing inputs, expected outputs, and the actual (incorrect) outputs from the code.

Identify why the code failed. Was the initial hypothesis incorrect? Was the implementation flawed? Did it miss an edge case or pattern visible in other examples?

Respond with the following deliverables:

- A concise analysis of the failure points based on the report.
- A refined hypothesis and natural language program describing the corrected or improved transformation rule.
- An updated YAML block documenting key facts, incorporating insights from the failed examples.

**Original Task Pairs:**

## train_1

**input:**
```
8 6 0 6
6 8 6 8
8 6 8 6
6 8 6 8
```


**output:**
```
8
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
2 1 2 1 2
1 1 1 1 1
2 1 2 1 2
0 0 1 1 1
0 0 2 1 2
```


**output:**
```
1 1
2 1
```


## train_3

**input:**
```
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
5 5 5 5 5 5 5
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
5 5 5 5 5 0 0
2 2 5 2 2 0 0
```


**output:**
```
5 5
5 2
```

 

**Previous Code:**
```python
"""
Extracted refined NLP from Dreamer's response 

The transformation operates based on the frequencies and values of the two unique non-zero colors present in the input grid.

1.  **Identify Colors and Frequencies:** Find the two unique non-zero colors (Color A, Color B) and count their occurrences (Freq A, Freq B). Ignore the color 0.
2.  **Determine Min/Max Colors:**
    *   Define `C_min` and `C_max`.
    *   If Freq A != Freq B: `C_min` is the color with the lower frequency, `C_max` is the color with the higher frequency.
    *   If Freq A == Freq B: `C_min` is the color with the lower numerical value, `C_max` is the color with the higher numerical value.
3.  **Check Connectivity:** Determine if any cell containing `C_min` is orthogonally adjacent (shares an edge) with another cell containing `C_min`. Let this be `is_connected`.
4.  **Generate Output:**
    *   **Case 1:** If frequencies were different AND `is_connected` is false (like train_1), the output is a 1x1 grid: `[[C_min]]`.
    *   **Case 2:** If frequencies were different AND `is_connected` is true (like train_2), the output is a 2x2 grid: `[[C_max, C_max], [C_min, C_max]]`.
    *   **Case 3:** If frequencies were tied (like train_3), the output is a 2x2 grid: `[[C_max, C_max], [C_max, C_min]]`.
