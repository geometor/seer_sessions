task_description: Analyze the input grid based on the frequencies of its two non-zero colors to determine the output grid.
observations:
  - Grids contain integers, with 0 typically acting as a background or ignored color.
  - All training examples feature exactly two unique non-zero colors.
  - The output grid size is either 1x1 or 2x2.
properties:
  - colors: The set of unique non-zero integer values in the grid.
  - frequency: The count of each non-zero color.
  - frequency_difference: The absolute difference between the frequencies of the two non-zero colors.
  - c_min: The non-zero color identified as 'minimum' based on frequency (lower) or value (lower if frequencies tied).
  - c_max: The non-zero color identified as 'maximum' based on frequency (higher) or value (higher if frequencies tied).
rules:
  - rule_1x1:
      condition: frequency_difference == 1.
      output: '[[c_min]]'
  - rule_2x2_diff_freq:
      condition: frequency_difference > 1 (and frequencies differ).
      output: '[[c_max, c_max], [c_min, c_max]]'
  - rule_2x2_tied_freq:
      condition: frequency_difference == 0 (frequencies are tied).
      output: '[[c_max, c_max], [c_max, c_min]]'
uncertainty:
  - Assumes exactly two non-zero colors will be present in test cases.
  - Previous execution reports for train_2 and train_3 seemed inconsistent with the code's logic, potentially indicating issues beyond the hypothesis itself, but the refined hypothesis now matches all expected training outputs.
