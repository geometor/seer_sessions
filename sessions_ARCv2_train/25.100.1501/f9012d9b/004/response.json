            "text": "**Analysis of Failure:**\n\n1.  **Identical Failure:** The execution report for the second attempt (`code_00.py`) is identical to the first attempt's report, despite the code accurately implementing the refined hypothesis (based on connectivity). Both attempts failed on `train_2` and `train_3` in the same way.\n2.  **Train_2 Failure:** The code produced `2`, while `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` was expected. Re-analysis shows that based on the previous hypothesis (differing frequencies + *connectivity* of `c_min`), the predicted output *should* be `[[2]]` because the `c_min` (color 2) cells are *not* connected. This means the code was likely executing the previous hypothesis correctly, but the hypothesis itself was flawed because it didn't match the expected output for `train_2`. The reported output `2` aligns with the flawed hypothesis, not the desired outcome.\n3.  **Train_3 Failure:** The code produced `[[2, 2], [5, 2]]`, while `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` was expected. The previous hypothesis (tied frequencies) correctly predicts the expected output `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`. The reported output `[[2, 2], [5, 2]]` contradicts both the hypothesis and the expected output, suggesting either an execution error or that the specific pattern for tied frequencies in the code was implemented incorrectly, despite appearing correct in the source.\n4.  **Root Cause:** The primary issue was the incorrect hypothesis regarding the role of `c_min` connectivity in determining the output size (1x1 vs 2x2) for cases with differing frequencies. The rule derived from train_1 (output `[[c_min]]` if not connected) did not apply correctly to train_2. The execution report discrepancies further confused the analysis, but the core problem seems to be the hypothesis itself.\n\n**Refined Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation is determined by analyzing the frequencies of the two unique non-zero colors in the input grid.\n\n1.  **Identify Colors and Frequencies:** Find the two unique non-zero colors (Color A, Color B) and count their occurrences (Freq A, Freq B). Ignore the color 0. Assume exactly two non-zero colors exist based on examples.\n2.  **Determine Min/Max Colors (`C_min`, `C_max`):**\n    *   If Freq A != Freq B: `C_min` is the color with the lower frequency, `C_max` is the color with the higher frequency.\n    *   If Freq A == Freq B: `C_min` is the color with the lower numerical value, `C_max` is the color with the higher numerical value.\n3.  **Calculate Frequency Difference:** Compute the absolute difference: `diff = abs(Freq A - Freq B)`.\n4.  **Generate Output Grid:**\n    *   **Case 1 (Difference is 1):** If `diff == 1`, the output is a 1x1 grid containing the minimum frequency color: `[[C_min]]`. (Matches train_1)\n    *   **Case 2 (Difference > 1):** If `diff > 1` (and frequencies are not tied), the output is a 2x2 grid arranged as: `[[C_max, C_max], [C_min, C_max]]`. (Matches train_2)\n    *   **Case 3 (Frequencies Tied):** If `diff == 0` (frequencies are tied), the output is a 2x2 grid arranged as: `[[C_max, C_max], [C_max, C_min]]`. (Matches train_3)\n\n**Updated YAML Facts:**\n\n"
