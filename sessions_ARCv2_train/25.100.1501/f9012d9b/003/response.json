Ignore the color 0.\n2.  **Determine Min/Max Colors:**\n    *   Define `C_min` and `C_max`.\n    *   If Freq A != Freq B: `C_min` is the color with the lower frequency, `C_max` is the color with the higher frequency.\n    *   If Freq A == Freq B: `C_min` is the color with the lower numerical value, `C_max` is the color with the higher numerical value.\n3.  **Check Connectivity:** Determine if any cell containing `C_min` is orthogonally adjacent (shares an edge) with another cell containing `C_min`. Let this be `is_connected`.\n4.  **Generate Output:**\n    *   **Case 1:** If frequencies were different AND `is_connected` is false (like train_1), the output is a 1x1 grid: `[[C_min]]`.\n    *   **Case 2:** If frequencies were different AND `is_connected` is true (like train_2), the output is a 2x2 grid: `[[C_max, C_max], [C_min, C_max]]`.\n    *   **Case 3:** If frequencies were tied (like train_3), the output is a 2x2 grid: `[[C_max, C_max], [C_max, C_min]]`.\n\"\"\"\nimport math\nimport copy\nfrom collections import Counter # Using standard library Counter for frequency counting\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on the refined hypothesized rule, analyzing\n    frequencies and connectivity of the two non-zero colors.\n    \"\"\"\n    height = len(input_grid)\n    if height == 0:\n        return []\n    width = len(input_grid[0])\n    if width == 0:\n        return [[] for _ in range(height)]\n\n    # --- Implement refined transformation logic here ---\n\n    # Step 1: Identify Colors and Frequencies (ignoring 0)\n    color_counts = Counter()\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            color = input_grid[r][c]\n            if color != 0:\n                color_counts[color] += 1\n\n    non_zero_colors = list(color_counts.keys())\n\n    # The logic derived relies on exactly two non-zero colors, as seen in examples.\n    # If this condition isn't met, the behavior is undefined by the examples.\n    # Returning an empty grid is a safe default.\n    if len(non_zero_colors) != 2:\n        # Consider adding specific handling if test cases include 0 or 1 non-zero colors.\n        return []\n\n    color_a = non_zero_colors[0]\n    color_b = non_zero_colors[1]\n    freq_a = color_counts[color_a]\n    freq_b = color_counts[color_b]\n\n    # Step 2: Determine C_min and C_max\n    c_min = -1\n    c_max = -1\n    frequencies_tied = False\n\n    if freq_a != freq_b:\n        # Frequencies differ: C_min has lower frequency\n        if freq_a < freq_b:\n            c_min = color_a\n            c_max = color_b\n        else:\n            c_min = color_b\n            c_max = color_a\n    else:\n        # Frequencies are tied: C_min has lower numerical value\n        frequencies_tied = True\n        if color_a < color_b:\n            c_min = color_a\n            c_max = color_b\n        else:\n            c_min = color_b\n            c_max = color_a\n\n    # Step 3: Check Connectivity of C_min\n    is_connected = False\n    min_color_coords = []\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            if input_grid[r][c] == c_min:\n                min_color_coords.append((r, c))\n\n    # Check adjacency for each C_min cell\n    for r, c in min_color_coords:\n        # Define orthogonal neighbors (North, South, East, West)\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            # Check if neighbor is within grid bounds\n            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                # Check if neighbor also has the C_min color\n                if input_grid[nr][nc] == c_min:\n                    is_connected = True\n                    break # Found a connection for this cell, no need to check other neighbors\n        if is_connected:\n            break # Found connection anywhere in the grid, no need to check other C_min cells\n\n    # Step 4: Generate Output based on the rules\n    output_grid = []\n    if not frequencies_tied and not is_connected:\n        # Case 1: Frequencies differ AND C_min is not connected (train_1)\n        output_grid = [[c_min]]\n    else:\n        # Case 2 or 3: Frequencies tied OR (Frequencies differ AND C_min is connected)\n        if not frequencies_tied:\n             # Case 2: Frequencies differ AND C_min is connected (train_2)\n             # Output: [[C_max, C_max], [C_min, C_max]]\n             output_grid = [[c_max, c_max], [c_min, c_max]]\n        else:\n             # Case 3: Frequencies are tied (train_3)\n             # Output: [[C_max, C_max], [C_max, C_min]]\n             output_grid = [[c_max, c_max], [c_max, c_min]]\n\n    # --- End refined transformation logic ---\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
