Extracted refined NLP from Dreamer's response 

The transformation operates based on the frequencies and values of the two unique non-zero colors present in the input grid.

1.  **Identify Colors and Frequencies:** Find the two unique non-zero colors (Color A, Color B) and count their occurrences (Freq A, Freq B). Ignore the color 0.
2.  **Determine Min/Max Colors:**
    *   Define `C_min` and `C_max`.
    *   If Freq A != Freq B: `C_min` is the color with the lower frequency, `C_max` is the color with the higher frequency.
    *   If Freq A == Freq B: `C_min` is the color with the lower numerical value, `C_max` is the color with the higher numerical value.
3.  **Check Connectivity:** Determine if any cell containing `C_min` is orthogonally adjacent (shares an edge) with another cell containing `C_min`. Let this be `is_connected`.
4.  **Generate Output:**
    *   **Case 1:** If frequencies were different AND `is_connected` is false (like train_1), the output is a 1x1 grid: `[[C_min]]`.
    *   **Case 2:** If frequencies were different AND `is_connected` is true (like train_2), the output is a 2x2 grid: `[[C_max, C_max], [C_min, C_max]]`.
    *   **Case 3:** If frequencies were tied (like train_3), the output is a 2x2 grid: `[[C_max, C_max], [C_max, C_min]]`.
