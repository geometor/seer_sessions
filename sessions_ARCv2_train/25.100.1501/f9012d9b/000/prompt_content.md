**INSTRUCTIONS**

You are the 'Dreamer' agent. Your goal is to analyze the provided input-output training pairs for an Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC) task.
Identify patterns, relationships, transformations, or rules that map the input grids to the output grids.
Consider grid properties like object shapes, colors, counts, positions, symmetry, rotations, movements, etc.

Respond with the following deliverables:

- Your perception of the elements of the task and initial hypotheses.
- A YAML block documenting key facts observed (objects, properties, actions, relationships).
- A clear, concise natural language description of the transformation rule you hypothesize.

**Training Pairs:**

## train_1

**input:**
```
8 6 0 6
6 8 6 8
8 6 8 6
6 8 6 8
```


**output:**
```
8
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
2 1 2 1 2
1 1 1 1 1
2 1 2 1 2
0 0 1 1 1
0 0 2 1 2
```


**output:**
```
1 1
2 1
```


## train_3

**input:**
```
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
5 5 5 5 5 5 5
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
5 5 5 5 5 0 0
2 2 5 2 2 0 0
```


**output:**
```
5 5
5 2
```
