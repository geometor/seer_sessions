**INSTRUCTIONS**

You are the 'Coder' agent. You have received an analysis and a natural language program from the 'Dreamer'.
Your task is to translate the natural language program into a Python `transform` function.

- Follow the template provided below exactly.
- Implement the logic described in the natural language program.
- Use standard Python lists for grid representation (list of lists of ints).
- Basic math/utility libraries (like `math`, `copy`) are available, but avoid complex dependencies like `numpy` or `pandas` unless absolutely necessary for the core logic.
- Add comments within the function to explain the steps.
- Ensure the function signature matches `def transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`.
- Output *only* the complete Python code block.

**Dreamer's Analysis and Program:**
```
Subgrid counts:
[[8 6]
 [6 8]]
   Count: 4
---
[[6 0]
 [8 6]]
   Count: 1
---
[[0 6]
 [6 8]]
   Count: 1
---
[[6 8]
 [8 6]]
   Count: 3
---

Unique subgrids (count = 1):
[[6 0]
 [8 6]]
[[0 6]
 [6 8]]

```

*   There are two unique 2x2 subgrids in train_1. This doesn't lead directly to the output 8.

**Hypothesis - Grid "Noise" Removal:**
What if the task involves identifying a primary pattern and removing noise (represented by 0s or maybe minority colors)?

*   **train_1:** Pattern is checkerboard 8s and 6s. The 0 is noise. The checkerboard pattern is made of `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]` repeating (mostly). The colors involved are 8 and 6. Output is 8. Why 8? Maybe the top-left color of the dominant pattern? Or the less frequent color (8)?
*   **train_2:** Pattern is alternating vertical stripes 2, 1, 2, 1, 2 and 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 etc. The 0s are noise. The dominant colors are 1 and 2. Output `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`. Contains both 1 and 2.
*   **train_3:** Pattern involves 2s and 5s, maybe `[[2, 2, 5], [2, 2, 5]]` blocks separated by 5s. The 0s are noise. Dominant colors are 2 and 5. Output `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`. Contains both 5 and 2.

**Refined Hypothesis - Subgrid Identification based on Frequency:**

1.  **Identify Candidate Subgrids:** Look at all possible 2x2 subgrids within the input grid.
2.  **Filter Subgrids:** Ignore any 2x2 subgrid that contains the color 0.
3.  **Count Frequencies:** Count the occurrences of the remaining (non-zero) 2x2 subgrids.
4.  **Select Output:**
    *   **If there is a *single* most frequent non-zero 2x2 subgrid:** The output is that subgrid.
    *   **If there is a *tie* for the most frequent non-zero 2x2 subgrid:** The output is the one among the tied subgrids that appears *last* (lowest row index, then highest column index in case of row tie) in the input grid.
    *   **If *no* 2x2 subgrid appears more than once (after filtering 0s):** Special case? Maybe related to train_1?
    *   **What about train_1's 1x1 output?** Maybe if the "winning" subgrid under the above rules has a simple structure (e.g., checkerboard of two colors), the output simplifies further? Or maybe the 1x1 output happens under different conditions?

Let's re-test this hypothesis:

*   **train_1:**
    *   Input: `[[8, 6, 0, 6], [6, 8, 6, 8], [8, 6, 8, 6], [6, 8, 6, 8]]`
    *   Non-zero 2x2 subgrids and counts:
        *   `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]`: Count 4 (at 0,0; 1,2; 2,3; 3,0 - wait, need tool)
        *   `[[6, 8], [8, 6]]`: Count 3 (at 1,0; 2,1; 3,2 - wait, need tool)
