Ignore the color 0. Assume exactly two non-zero colors exist based on examples.\n2.  **Determine Min/Max Colors (`C_min`, `C_max`):**\n    *   If Freq A != Freq B: `C_min` is the color with the lower frequency, `C_max` is the color with the higher frequency.\n    *   If Freq A == Freq B: `C_min` is the color with the lower numerical value, `C_max` is the color with the higher numerical value.\n3.  **Calculate Frequency Difference:** Compute the absolute difference: `diff = abs(Freq A - Freq B)`.\n4.  **Generate Output Grid:**\n    *   **Case 1 (Difference is 1):** If `diff == 1`, the output is a 1x1 grid containing the minimum frequency color: `[[C_min]]`. (Matches train_1)\n    *   **Case 2 (Difference > 1):** If `diff > 1` (and frequencies are not tied), the output is a 2x2 grid arranged as: `[[C_max, C_max], [C_min, C_max]]`. (Matches train_2)\n    *   **Case 3 (Frequencies Tied):** If `diff == 0` (frequencies are tied), the output is a 2x2 grid arranged as: `[[C_max, C_max], [C_max, C_min]]`.
