*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are grids (matrices) of single-digit integers.
    *   The dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the input grid are preserved in the output grid.
    *   Changes occur row by row. Some rows remain identical between input and output, while others are modified.
    *   In the examples provided, the modification specifically happens on the odd-indexed rows (row 1, row 3, etc., using 0-based indexing).
    *   The modification appears to be a circular shift or rotation of the elements within the affected rows. Specifically, it looks like a right circular shift by one position.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - grid:
          description: A 2D array of single-digit integers.
          properties:
            - rows: A list of row objects.
            - dimensions: [height, width]
      - row:
          description: A 1D array (list) of single-digit integers representing a horizontal line in the grid.
          properties:
            - elements: A list of integer elements.
            - index: The 0-based vertical position of the row within the grid.
      - element:
          description: A single integer digit within a row.
          properties:
            - value: The integer value.
            - position: The 0-based horizontal index within the row.
    actions:
      - rotate_right:
          description: Performs a circular shift of elements in a row one position to the right. The last element becomes the first.
          target: row
          condition: Applies only if the row's index is odd.
    relationships:
      - grid_contains_rows: A grid is composed of multiple rows.
      - row_contains_elements: A row is composed of multiple elements.
      - transformation_modifies_rows: The overall task transforms the input grid by potentially modifying individual rows based on their index.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the row's index (starting from 0).
    2.  For each row, check if its index is odd.
    3.  If the row index is odd, perform a right circular shift on the elements of that row by one position (move the last element to the first position, and shift all other elements one position to the right).
    4.  If the row index is even, leave the row unchanged.
    5.  Construct the output grid using the processed rows (either modified or unchanged).
