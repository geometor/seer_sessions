Some rows remain identical between input and output, while others are modified.\n    *   In the examples provided, the modification specifically happens on the odd-indexed rows (row 1, row 3, etc., using 0-based indexing).\n    *   The modification appears to be a circular shift or rotation of the elements within the affected rows. Specifically, it looks like a right circular shift by one position.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
