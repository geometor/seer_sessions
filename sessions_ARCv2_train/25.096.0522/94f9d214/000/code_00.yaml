Task: Grid Transformation

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Dimensions: 8x4
  Cell_Values: [0, 1, 3]
  Structure: Conceptually divisible into two 4x4 subgrids (Top: rows 0-3, Bottom: rows 4-7)

Output:
  Type: Grid
  Dimensions: 4x4
  Cell_Values: [0, 2]

Transformation:
  Action: Compare corresponding cells from the Top and Bottom subgrids of the input.
  Rule:
    - For each coordinate (row `r`, column `c`) from 0 to 3:
      - Let `top_val` be the value at Input[r][c].
      - Let `bottom_val` be the value at Input[r+4][c].
      - If `top_val` is 0 AND `bottom_val` is 0:
        - The Output[r][c] value is 2.
      - Otherwise:
        - The Output[r][c] value is 0.
  Relationship: The output grid is generated cell by cell based on the comparison of vertically aligned cells in the input grid.
