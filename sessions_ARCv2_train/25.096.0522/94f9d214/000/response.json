            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input is always an 8x4 grid of digits. The digits observed are 0, 1, and 3.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output is always a 4x4 grid of digits. The digits observed are 0 and 2.\n3.  **Dimensionality Change:** The height of the grid is halved from 8 rows to 4 rows, while the width remains the same (4 columns).\n4.  **Implicit Input Division:** The 8x4 input grid can be naturally viewed as two stacked 4x4 subgrids. Let's call the top 4x4 grid `Top` (rows 0-3) and the bottom 4x4 grid `Bottom` (rows 4-7).\n5.  **Cell-wise Operation:** The output grid's dimensions match the dimensions of the `Top` and `Bottom` subgrids. This suggests that each cell in the output grid `O[r][c]` might be derived from the corresponding cells in the input subgrids, namely `Top[r][c]` and `Bottom[r][c]`.\n6.  **Value Transformation:** The input values (0, 1, 3) are transformed into output values (0, 2). The value `1` and `3` in the input seem to result in `0` in the output under most conditions. The value `2` only appears in the output. Observing the examples, the output value `2` appears specifically when the corresponding cell in the `Top` subgrid is `0` *and* the corresponding cell in the `Bottom` subgrid is `0`. In all other cases (combinations involving 1 or 3, or combinations of 0 with 1 or 3), the output cell value is `0`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

If both are 0, set the value of the output grid at position `(r, c)` to 2.\n7.  If the condition in step 5 is not met (i.e., at least one of the values is not 0), the output grid value at `(r, c)` remains 0.\n8.  Return the completed 4x4 output grid."
