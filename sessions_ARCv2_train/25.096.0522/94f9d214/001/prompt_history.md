Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input is always an 8x4 grid of digits. The digits observed are 0, 1, and 3.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output is always a 4x4 grid of digits. The digits observed are 0 and 2.
3.  **Dimensionality Change:** The height of the grid is halved from 8 rows to 4 rows, while the width remains the same (4 columns).
4.  **Implicit Input Division:** The 8x4 input grid can be naturally viewed as two stacked 4x4 subgrids. Let's call the top 4x4 grid `Top` (rows 0-3) and the bottom 4x4 grid `Bottom` (rows 4-7).
5.  **Cell-wise Operation:** The output grid's dimensions match the dimensions of the `Top` and `Bottom` subgrids. This suggests that each cell in the output grid `O[r][c]` might be derived from the corresponding cells in the input subgrids, namely `Top[r][c]` and `Bottom[r][c]`.
6.  **Value Transformation:** The input values (0, 1, 3) are transformed into output values (0, 2). The value `1` and `3` in the input seem to result in `0` in the output under most conditions. The value `2` only appears in the output. Observing the examples, the output value `2` appears specifically when the corresponding cell in the `Top` subgrid is `0` *and* the corresponding cell in the `Bottom` subgrid is `0`. In all other cases (combinations involving 1 or 3, or combinations of 0 with 1 or 3), the output cell value is `0`.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Dimensions: 8x4
  Cell_Values: [0, 1, 3]
  Structure: Conceptually divisible into two 4x4 subgrids (Top: rows 0-3, Bottom: rows 4-7)

Output:
  Type: Grid
  Dimensions: 4x4
  Cell_Values: [0, 2]

Transformation:
  Action: Compare corresponding cells from the Top and Bottom subgrids of the input.
  Rule:
    - For each coordinate (row `r`, column `c`) from 0 to 3:
      - Let `top_val` be the value at Input[r][c].
      - Let `bottom_val` be the value at Input[r+4][c].
      - If `top_val` is 0 AND `bottom_val` is 0:
        - The Output[r][c] value is 2.
      - Otherwise:
        - The Output[r][c] value is 0.
  Relationship: The output grid is generated cell by cell based on the comparison of vertically aligned cells in the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Divide the 8x4 input grid into two 4x4 subgrids: the `Top` subgrid (rows 0-3) and the `Bottom` subgrid (rows 4-7).
2.  Create a new 4x4 output grid, initialized with zeros.
3.  Iterate through each cell position `(r, c)` from `r=0` to `3` and `c=0` to `3`.
4.  For the current position `(r, c)`, get the value `top_val` from `Top[r][c]` and the value `bottom_val` from `Bottom[r][c]`.
5.  Check if both `top_val` and `bottom_val` are equal to 0.
6.  If both are 0, set the value of the output grid at position `(r, c)` to 2.
7.  If the condition in step 5 is not met (i.e., at least one of the values is not 0), the output grid value at `(r, c)` remains 0.
8.  Return the completed 4x4 output grid.
