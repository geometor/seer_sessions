```python
"""
Transforms an input grid of 0s and 1s into an output grid of 0s and 2s.
The transformation involves two main steps:
1. Value Replacement: All 1s in the input grid are replaced with 2s.
2. Row Appending: A specific subset of rows from the modified grid (with 1s replaced by 2s) is appended to the bottom of the grid. The number of rows appended is ceil(H/2) and they are selected starting from row index floor(H/3), where H is the original height of the input grid.

    Args:
