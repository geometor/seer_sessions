objects:
  - Input Grid: A 2D array of integers (0 or 1).
    properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W
      - cells: containing values 0 or 1
  - Output Grid: A 2D array of integers (0 or 2).
    properties:
      - height: H + ceil(H/2)
      - width: W
      - cells: containing values 0 or 2
  - Modified Grid: An intermediate 2D array derived from Input Grid.
    properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W
      - cells: containing values 0 or 2 (where input 1s become 2s)
  - Appended Row Slice: A contiguous subset of rows selected from the Modified Grid.
    properties:
      - count: `num_appended = ceil(H/2)`
      - source_start_index: `start = floor(H/3)` in Modified Grid
      - source_end_index: `end = min(start + num_appended, H)` in Modified Grid
      - content: Rows from Modified Grid index `start` up to (but not including) index `end`.

actions:
  - Value Replacement: Change cell value 1 to 2 across the entire Input Grid to create the Modified Grid.
  - Row Slicing: Select a contiguous block of rows from the Modified Grid based on calculated start index and count.
  - Vertical Concatenation: Append the selected Row Slice to the bottom of the Modified Grid to form the Output Grid.

relationships:
  - The Output Grid is formed by vertically stacking the Modified Grid on top of the Appended Row Slice.
  - The Modified Grid is derived from the Input Grid by applying the Value Replacement action to all cells.
  - The Appended Row Slice is selected from the Modified Grid using indices determined by the Input Grid's height (H).
  - The height of the Output Grid is the height of the Modified Grid plus the height (count) of the Appended Row Slice.
  - The width of the Output Grid is the same as the width of the Input Grid and Modified Grid.
