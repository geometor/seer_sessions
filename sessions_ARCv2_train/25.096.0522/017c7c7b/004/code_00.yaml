objects:
  - Input Grid: A 2D array of integers (0 or 1).
    properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W
      - cells: containing values 0 or 1
  - Output Grid: A 2D array of integers (0 or 2).
    properties:
      - height: H + ceil(H/2)
      - width: W
      - cells: containing values 0 or 2
  - Modified Grid: An intermediate 2D array derived from Input Grid.
    properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W
      - cells: containing values 0 or 2 (1s replaced by 2s)
      - has_consecutive_identical_rows: Boolean flag indicating if any row `i` is identical to row `i+1`.
  - Appended Rows: A subset of rows from the Modified Grid.
    properties:
      - count: ceil(H/2)
      - source_start_index: Calculated based on H and `has_consecutive_identical_rows`.
      - source_end_index: min(source_start_index + count, H)
      - selected_rows: Rows from Modified Grid sliced from `source_start_index` to `source_end_index`.

actions:
  - Value Replacement: Change cell value 1 to 2 in the Input Grid to create the Modified Grid.
  - Check Consecutive Rows: Iterate through the Modified Grid (from row 0 to H-2) and compare row `i` with row `i+1` to set `has_consecutive_identical_rows`.
  - Calculate Start Index:
      If `has_consecutive_identical_rows` is True, set `source_start_index = 0`.
      Otherwise, set `source_start_index = floor(H / 3)`.
  - Row Selection: Select a slice of `count` rows from the Modified Grid, starting at `source_start_index` and ending before `source_end_index`.
  - Vertical Concatenation: Append the `selected_rows` to the bottom of the Modified Grid to form the Output Grid.

relationships:
  - The Output Grid is formed by vertically stacking the Modified Grid on top of the Appended Rows.
  - The Modified Grid is derived from the Input Grid by applying the Value Replacement action.
  - The selection of Appended Rows depends on the height (H) and whether the Modified Grid contains consecutive identical rows.
