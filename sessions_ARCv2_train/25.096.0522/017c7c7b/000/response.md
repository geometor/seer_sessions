*   **Perception of Elements:** The task involves transforming a 2D grid of binary digits (0 and 1) into a larger 2D grid containing digits 0 and 2. The transformation involves both changing cell values and altering the grid's dimensions by appending rows.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - Input Grid: A 2D array of integers (0 or 1).
        properties:
          - height: H
          - width: W
          - cells: containing values 0 or 1
      - Output Grid: A 2D array of integers (0 or 2).
        properties:
          - height: H + ceil(H/2)
          - width: W
          - cells: containing values 0 or 2
      - Modified Grid: An intermediate 2D array derived from Input Grid.
        properties:
          - height: H
          - width: W
          - cells: containing values 0 or 2 (1s replaced by 2s)
      - Appended Rows: A subset of rows from the Modified Grid.
        properties:
          - count: ceil(H/2)
          - source_indices: from floor(H/3) up to (floor(H/3) + ceil(H/2) - 1) in Modified Grid

    actions:
      - Value Replacement: Change cell value 1 to 2.
      - Row Selection: Identify specific rows from the Modified Grid based on input height H.
      - Vertical Concatenation: Append the selected rows to the bottom of the Modified Grid.

    relationships:
      - The Output Grid is formed by vertically stacking the Modified Grid on top of the Appended Rows.
      - The Modified Grid is derived from the Input Grid by applying the Value Replacement action to all cells.
      - The Appended Rows are selected from the middle section of the Modified Grid. The exact indices depend on the input height H.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Read the input grid and determine its height (H) and width (W).
    2.  Create a new grid, called the "modified grid," with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    3.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid:
        *   If the cell value is 1, set the corresponding cell value in the modified grid to 2.
        *   If the cell value is 0, set the corresponding cell value in the modified grid to 0.
    4.  Calculate the number of rows to append: `num_appended_rows = ceil(H / 2)`.
    5.  Calculate the starting row index for the rows to append from the modified grid: `start_index = floor(H / 3)`.
    6.  Select the sequence of `num_appended_rows` rows from the modified grid, starting from `start_index`. Call this sequence "appended rows".
    7.  Construct the final output grid by vertically concatenating the complete modified grid with the "appended rows" sequence below it. The output grid will have dimensions `(H + num_appended_rows) x W`.
