```python
"""
Transforms an input grid of 0s and 1s into an output grid of 0s and 2s.
The transformation involves two main steps:
1. Value Replacement: All 1s in the input grid are replaced with 2s to create a modified grid.
2. Row Appending: A specific slice of rows from the modified grid is appended to its bottom. 
   - The number of rows to append is ceil(H/2).
   - The starting index for the slice is 0 if the modified grid contains any two consecutive identical rows; otherwise, it's floor(H/3).
   - The slice runs from the calculated starting index up to min(start_index + ceil(H/2), H).
