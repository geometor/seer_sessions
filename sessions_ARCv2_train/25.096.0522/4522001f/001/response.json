Initialize a 9x9 output grid with zeros.\n2. Find the location of the digit '2' (assuming at most one).\n3. Find all locations of the digit '3'. Determine the 'anchor' location, which is the top-leftmost '3'.\n4. Based on the anchor '3' location, select a placement pattern for two 4x4 blocks of '3's in the output grid. One block corresponds to the input '3's, and the other corresponds to the input '2'.\n    - If the anchor '3' is at (0,0) in the input:\n        - The '3' block starts at (0,0) in the output.\n        - The '2' block starts at (4,4) in the output.\n    - If the anchor '3' is at (1,2) in the input:\n        - The '3' block starts at (5,5) in the output.\n        - The '2' block starts at (1,1) in the output.\n5.
