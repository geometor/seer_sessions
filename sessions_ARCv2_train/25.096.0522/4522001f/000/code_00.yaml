task_description: "Transform a 3x3 input grid into a 9x9 output grid based on the location of specific digits."

input_grid:
  properties:
    - dimensions: 3x3
    - cell_values: Digits 0, 2, 3

output_grid:
  properties:
    - dimensions: 9x9
    - cell_values: Digits 0, 3
    - background_value: 0
    - contains: Up to two distinct 4x4 blocks of digit 3.

objects:
  - name: input_digit_2
    properties:
      - value: 2
      - location: (r2, c2) in the input grid (assuming at most one instance)
    actions:
      - triggers_placement: of a 4x4 block of 3s in the output.
  - name: input_digit_3
    properties:
      - value: 3
      - locations: One or more (r, c) in the input grid.
    actions:
      - triggers_placement: of a 4x4 block of 3s in the output.
      - determines_pattern: The location of the top-leftmost '3' (anchor) influences the placement of both blocks.
  - name: output_block_3
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x4
      - fill_value: 3
      - count: up to 2 per output grid.
      - placement: Determined by a specific pattern based on the input.

relationships:
  - type: conditional_placement
    details: "The placement pattern for the 4x4 blocks depends on the anchor location of input digit '3'."
    patterns:
      - name: pattern_A
        condition: "Input '3' anchor is at (0,0)."
        placement:
          - block_for_3: Top-left at (0,0) in output.
          - block_for_2: Top-left at (4,4) in output (if '2' exists).
      - name: pattern_B
        condition: "Input '3' anchor is at (1,2)."
        placement:
          - block_for_3: Top-left at (5,5) in output.
          - block_for_2: Top-left at (1,1) in output (if '2' exists).

assumptions:
  - The input grid contains at most one digit '2'.
  - If both '2' and '3' are present, two blocks are generated.
  - If only one type ('2' or '3') is present, potentially only one block is generated according to the determined pattern. (Requires more examples to confirm).
