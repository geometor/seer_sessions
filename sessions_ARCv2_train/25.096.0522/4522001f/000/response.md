Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid containing digits 0, 2, and 3.
2.  **Output:** A 9x9 grid containing digits 0 and 3.
3.  **Transformation:** The output grid's structure seems determined by the presence and location of the digits '2' and '3' in the input grid.
4.  **Key Features:**
    *   The output grid is significantly larger than the input (3x3 -> 9x9).
    *   Input '0' seems to map to output '0' as a background/default value.
    *   Both input '2' and input '3' cause 4x4 blocks of '3's to appear in the output grid.
    *   There appear to be two distinct 4x4 blocks of '3's generated in the output if both '2' and '3' are present in the input.
    *   The specific placement of these two 4x4 blocks in the 9x9 output grid depends on the location of the input digits. Specifically, the location of the top-leftmost '3' seems to dictate which overall placement pattern is used.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: "Transform a 3x3 input grid into a 9x9 output grid based on the location of specific digits."

input_grid:
  properties:
    - dimensions: 3x3
    - cell_values: Digits 0, 2, 3

output_grid:
  properties:
    - dimensions: 9x9
    - cell_values: Digits 0, 3
    - background_value: 0
    - contains: Up to two distinct 4x4 blocks of digit 3.

objects:
  - name: input_digit_2
    properties:
      - value: 2
      - location: (r2, c2) in the input grid (assuming at most one instance)
    actions:
      - triggers_placement: of a 4x4 block of 3s in the output.
  - name: input_digit_3
    properties:
      - value: 3
      - locations: One or more (r, c) in the input grid.
    actions:
      - triggers_placement: of a 4x4 block of 3s in the output.
      - determines_pattern: The location of the top-leftmost '3' (anchor) influences the placement of both blocks.
  - name: output_block_3
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x4
      - fill_value: 3
      - count: up to 2 per output grid.
      - placement: Determined by a specific pattern based on the input.

relationships:
  - type: conditional_placement
    details: "The placement pattern for the 4x4 blocks depends on the anchor location of input digit '3'."
    patterns:
      - name: pattern_A
        condition: "Input '3' anchor is at (0,0)."
        placement:
          - block_for_3: Top-left at (0,0) in output.
          - block_for_2: Top-left at (4,4) in output (if '2' exists).
      - name: pattern_B
        condition: "Input '3' anchor is at (1,2)."
        placement:
          - block_for_3: Top-left at (5,5) in output.
          - block_for_2: Top-left at (1,1) in output (if '2' exists).

assumptions:
  - The input grid contains at most one digit '2'.
  - If both '2' and '3' are present, two blocks are generated.
  - If only one type ('2' or '3') is present, potentially only one block is generated according to the determined pattern. (Requires more examples to confirm).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize a 9x9 output grid filled with the digit 0.
2.  Scan the 3x3 input grid to find the location(s) of the digit '3'.
3.  If one or more '3's are found, identify the coordinate (r3, c3) of the top-leftmost '3' (the anchor). If no '3' is found, proceed to step 6.
4.  Scan the 3x3 input grid to find the location (r2, c2) of the digit '2'. If no '2' is found, set a flag indicating its absence.
5.  Determine the placement pattern based on the anchor coordinate (r3, c3) identified in step 3:
    *   **If (r3, c3) is (0,0):**
        *   Draw a 4x4 block of '3's in the output grid starting at position (0,0).
        *   If '2' was found in step 4, draw a second 4x4 block of '3's in the output grid starting at position (4,4).
    *   **If (r3, c3) is (1,2
