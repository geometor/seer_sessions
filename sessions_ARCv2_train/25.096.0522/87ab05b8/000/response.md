Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** Both input and output are 4x4 grids containing single digits.
2.  **Grid Structure:** The transformation appears to operate on 2x2 blocks or quadrants within the 4x4 grid.
3.  **Key Values:** The digits '2' and '6' seem particularly important in determining the output. The output grid consists only of '2's and '6's.
4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The output grid seems to be constructed by examining specific regions (quadrants) of the input grid and applying a rule based on the content of those regions. Specifically, the presence or absence of the digit '2' in an input quadrant dictates the value used to fill the corresponding output quadrant.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - dimensions: 4x4
      - cell_content: digits
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - dimensions: 4x4
      - cell_content: digits (specifically '2' or '6')
structure:
  - division: The 4x4 input grid is conceptually divided into four non-overlapping 2x2 quadrants.
    quadrants:
      - top_left: rows 0-1, columns 0-1
      - top_right: rows 0-1, columns 2-3
      - bottom_left: rows 2-3, columns 0-1
      - bottom_right: rows 2-3, columns 2-3
transformation:
  - type: conditional_fill
  - based_on: quadrant_content
  - condition_digit: 2
  - fill_digits:
      if_present: 2
      if_absent: 6
relationships:
  - rule: Each 2x2 quadrant in the output grid corresponds directly to the 2x2 quadrant in the same position within the input grid.
  - dependency: The content of an output quadrant depends solely on whether the digit '2' exists within the corresponding input quadrant.
action:
  - name: process_quadrant
    steps:
      - identify the input quadrant
      - check for the presence of the digit '2' within it
      - determine the fill digit for the output quadrant ('2' if '2' was present, '6' otherwise)
      - fill the corresponding output quadrant with the determined digit
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty 4x4 output grid.
2.  Divide the 4x4 input grid into four 2x2 quadrants: top-left (rows 0-1, cols 0-1), top-right (rows 0-1, cols 2-3), bottom-left (rows 2-3, cols 0-1), and bottom-right (rows 2-3, cols 2-3).
3.  For each input quadrant:
    a.  Examine all four cells within the current input quadrant.
    b.  Check if the digit '2' is present in any of these four cells.
    c.  If the digit '2' is found within the input quadrant, fill the corresponding 2x2 quadrant in the output grid entirely with the digit '2'.
    d.  If the digit '2' is *not* found within the input quadrant, fill the corresponding 2x2 quadrant in the output grid entirely with the digit '6'.
4.  Return the completed 4x4 output grid.
