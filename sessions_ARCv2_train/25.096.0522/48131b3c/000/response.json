Let's call the input grid `I` and its dimension `N`. The output grid is also a square grid, but with dimensions `2N x 2N`.\n\nThe core transformation involves creating an intermediate pattern grid `P` of the same size as the input grid `I`. This pattern `P` is derived from `I` through specific row manipulations:\n1.  The first two rows of `P` are the first two rows of `I`, but swapped.\n2.  The subsequent rows of `P` (from index 2 to N-1) are generated by transforming the corresponding rows of `I`. This transformation involves swapping the roles of `0` and the non-zero digit `d`: where `I` has a `0`, `P` has `d`; where `I` has `d`, `P` has `0`.\n\nFinally, the output grid is constructed by tiling this intermediate pattern grid `P` four times in a 2x2 arrangement (`P P / P P`).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
