task_elements:
  - object: Input Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - shape: square (N x N)
      - content: contains 0 and one unique non-zero digit (d)
  - object: Output Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - shape: square (2N x 2N)
      - relation_to_input: derived by tiling a transformed pattern
  - object: Intermediate Pattern Grid (P)
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - shape: square (N x N)
      - relation_to_input: derived from Input Grid through row operations
      - generation_rule:
          - step_1: Swap row 0 and row 1 of Input Grid
          - step_2: Transform rows 2 to N-1 of Input Grid element-wise (0 becomes d, d becomes 0)
  - property: Non-zero Digit (d)
    description: The unique digit in the Input Grid that is not 0. Used in the transformation rule for rows 2 to N-1.
actions:
  - name: Identify Non-zero Digit
    input: Input Grid
    output: Non-zero digit (d)
  - name: Swap Rows
    input: Input Grid (rows 0 and 1)
    output: First two rows of Intermediate Pattern Grid
  - name: Transform Row Elements
    input: Input Grid (rows 2 to N-1), Non-zero digit (d)
    output: Rows 2 to N-1 of Intermediate Pattern Grid
    rule: For element I[i, j] (where i >= 2), P[i, j] = d if I[i, j] == 0, else P[i, j] = 0
  - name: Tile Grid
    input: Intermediate Pattern Grid (P)
    output: Output Grid
    rule: Arrange P in a 2x2 layout [P, P; P, P]
relationships:
  - The Output Grid size is double the Input Grid size in both dimensions.
  - The Output Grid is composed entirely of four identical copies of the Intermediate Pattern Grid.
  - The Intermediate Pattern Grid's structure depends directly on the Input Grid's rows and the non-zero digit.
