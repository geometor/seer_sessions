Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

## Perception

The input is always a square grid containing the digit `0` and one other non-zero digit. Let's call the input grid `I` and its dimension `N`. The output grid is also a square grid, but with dimensions `2N x 2N`.

The core transformation involves creating an intermediate pattern grid `P` of the same size as the input grid `I`. This pattern `P` is derived from `I` through specific row manipulations:
1.  The first two rows of `P` are the first two rows of `I`, but swapped.
2.  The subsequent rows of `P` (from index 2 to N-1) are generated by transforming the corresponding rows of `I`. This transformation involves swapping the roles of `0` and the non-zero digit `d`: where `I` has a `0`, `P` has `d`; where `I` has `d`, `P` has `0`.

Finally, the output grid is constructed by tiling this intermediate pattern grid `P` four times in a 2x2 arrangement (`P P / P P`).

## Facts

task_elements:
  - object: Input Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers

      - content: contains 0 and one unique non-zero digit (d)
  - object: Output Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - shape: square (2N x 2N)
      - relation_to_input: derived by tiling a transformed pattern
  - object: Intermediate Pattern Grid (P)
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - shape: square (N x N)
      - relation_to_input: derived from Input Grid through row operations
      - generation_rule:
          - step_1: Swap row 0 and row 1 of Input Grid
          - step_2: Transform rows 2 to N-1 of Input Grid element-wise (0 becomes d, d becomes 0)
  - property: Non-zero Digit (d)
    description: The unique digit in the Input Grid that is not 0. Used in the transformation rule for rows 2 to N-1.
actions:
  - name: Identify Non-zero Digit
    input: Input Grid
    output: Non-zero digit (d)
  - name: Swap Rows
    input: Input Grid (rows 0 and 1)
    output: First two rows of Intermediate Pattern Grid
  - name: Transform Row Elements
    input: Input Grid (rows 2 to N-1), Non-zero digit (d)
    output: Rows 2 to N-1 of Intermediate Pattern Grid
    rule: For element I[i, j] (where i >= 2), P[i, j] = d if I[i, j] == 0, else P[i, j] = 0
  - name: Tile Grid
    input: Intermediate Pattern Grid (P)
    output: Output Grid
    rule: Arrange P in a 2x2 layout [P, P; P, P]
relationships:
  - The Output Grid size is double the Input Grid size in both dimensions.
  - The Output Grid is composed entirely of four identical copies of the Intermediate Pattern Grid.
  - The Intermediate Pattern Grid's structure depends directly on the Input Grid's rows and the non-zero digit.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Analyze Input:** Receive the input grid `I` (size N x N). Identify the unique non-zero digit `d` present in the grid.
2.  **Initialize Pattern:** Create a new empty grid `P` of the same dimensions as the input grid (N x N).
3.  **Process First Two Rows:**
    *   Copy row 1 of the input grid `I` to row 0 of the pattern grid `P`.
    *   Copy row 0 of the input grid `I` to row 1 of the pattern grid `P`.
4.  **Process Remaining Rows:** For each row index `i` from 2 up to N-1:
    *   For each column index `j` from 0 up to N-1:
        *   Examine the element `I[i, j]` in the input grid.
        *   If `I[i, j]` is 0, set the corresponding element `P[i, j]` in the pattern grid to the non-zero digit `d`.
        *   If `I[i, j]` is `d`, set the corresponding element `P[i, j]` in the pattern grid to 0.
5.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid (size 2N x 2N) by tiling the completed pattern grid `P` in a 2x2 arrangement. Place `P` in the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right quadrants of the output grid.
6.  **Return Output:** Return the constructed 2N x 2N output grid.
