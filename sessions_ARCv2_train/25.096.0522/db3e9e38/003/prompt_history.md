Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.    **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) of integers. The dimensions seem to remain consistent between input and output for each example.
2.  **Key Input Feature:** The input grids contain mostly zeros but have a distinct vertical line composed of the number 7.
3.  **Output Pattern:** The output grids also contain zeros, 7s, and a new number, 8. The 7s and 8s form a pattern that seems to originate from the location of the input line of 7s but expands outwards. The original line of 7s in the input is not directly preserved, except potentially the topmost '7'.
4.  **Propagation:** The pattern in the output looks like a wave or propagation spreading from a starting point. The values alternate between 7 and 8 as the pattern spreads.
5.  **Starting Point:** Comparing the two examples, the pattern seems to consistently start from the *topmost* '7' found in the input grid.
6.  **Alternating Values:** Cells adjacent (orthogonally) to a '7' in the output pattern become '8', and cells adjacent to an '8' become '7', provided they haven't been filled yet. This suggests a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or similar layer-by-layer expansion where the value depends on the value of the cell from which it's expanding.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Grid value propagation based on seed location

Objects:
  - Input_Grid:
      Type: 2D integer array
      Contains: Background value (0), Seed value (7)
      Structure: Primarily background values with one or more occurrences of the seed value, often forming a vertical line.
  - Output_Grid:
      Type: 2D integer array
      Dimensions: Same as Input_Grid
      Contains: Background value (0), Propagation values (7, 8)
      Structure: A pattern of alternating propagation values expanding from a specific point, replacing original values.
  - Seed_Cell:
      Identification: The topmost cell in the Input_Grid containing the Seed value (7).
      Properties: Row index, Column index, Value (7).
  - Propagation_Pattern:
      Values: Alternating sequence (7, 8, 7, 8, ...)
      Mechanism: Spreads outwards orthogonally (up, down, left, right) from the Seed_Cell.

Relationships:
  - Origin: The Propagation_Pattern in the Output_Grid originates from the Seed_Cell identified in the Input_Grid.
  - Overwrite: The Propagation_Pattern overwrites the initial content (0s or other 7s from the input) of the Output_Grid cells it covers.
  - Adjacency_Rule: Orthogonally adjacent cells in the Propagation_Pattern have alternating values (if one is 7, its newly filled neighbors are 8, and vice-versa).

Action:
  - Find_Seed: Locate the row and column of the topmost Seed value (7) in the Input_Grid.
  - Initialize_Output: Create an Output_Grid of the same size as the Input_Grid, filled with the background value (0).
  - Propagate:
      Starting_Condition: Place the Seed value (7) at the Seed_Cell location in the Output_Grid.
      Process: Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the Seed_Cell.
      Rule: For each cell visited, assign the alternating value (8 if current is 7, 7 if current is 8) to its unvisited orthogonal neighbors within the grid boundaries. Mark neighbors as visited and add them to the BFS queue.
      Termination: Continue until the BFS queue is empty.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid, `output_grid`, with the same dimensions as the `input_grid`, and initialize all its cells to 0.
2.  Scan the `input_grid` row by row, then column by column, to find the coordinates `(seed_row, seed_col)` of the first cell encountered that contains the value 7.
3.  If no cell with the value 7 is found in the `input_grid`, return the initialized `output_grid`.
4.  If a seed cell `(seed_row, seed_col)` is found:
    a.  Initialize a queue data structure for Breadth-First Search (BFS).
    b.  Initialize a data structure (e.g., a set of coordinate tuples or a boolean grid) called `visited` to keep track of cells that have been assigned a value and added to the queue.
    c.  Set the value of `output_grid[seed_row][seed_col]` to 7.
    d.  Add the tuple `(seed_row, seed_col, 7)` representing (row, column, value) to the queue.
    e.  Add the coordinates `(seed_row, seed_col)` to `visited`.
    f.  While the queue is not empty:
        i.   Dequeue the next element `(current_row, current_col, current_value)`.
        ii.  Determine the `next_value` for neighbors: if `current_value` is 7, `next_value` is 8; otherwise, `next_value` is 7.
        iii. Consider the four orthogonal neighbors: `(current_row - 1, current_col)`, `(current_row + 1, current_col)`, `(current_row, current_col - 1)`, `(current_row, current_col + 1)`.
        iv.  For each neighbor `(neighbor_row, neighbor_col)`:
             1. Check if `(neighbor_row, neighbor_col)` is within the valid bounds of the grid.
             2. Check if `(neighbor_row, neighbor_col)` has *not* been marked as `visited`.
             3. If both checks pass:
                 *   Set `output_grid[neighbor_row][neighbor_col]` to `next_value`.
                 *   Mark `(neighbor_row, neighbor_col)` as `visited`.
                 *   Enqueue the tuple `(neighbor_row, neighbor_col, next_value)`.
5.  Return the completed `output_grid`.

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis identified a BFS-like propagation pattern originating from a single seed (the topmost '7'). However, the test results clearly show this is incorrect, as the generated pattern covers the entire grid instead of the limited, specific pattern in the expected output. The key discrepancy lies in the initialization and the extent of the propagation.

The failed outputs suggest that the propagation rule (alternating 7s and 8s based on neighbors) might be correct, but the starting condition needs refinement. The original '7' cells in the input seem to remain '7' in the output, acting as fixed points or the initial layer of the propagation. The propagation should likely start from *all* input '7' locations simultaneously.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-analyze Initialization:** Instead of finding only the topmost '7', identify *all* cells containing '7' in the input grid.
2.  **Modify BFS Setup:** Initialize the output grid by placing '7' at all identified input '7' locations. Add all these locations to the initial BFS queue and the visited set.
3.  **Run BFS:** Execute the BFS as before, propagating outwards from *all* initial seeds, alternating between 8 and 7 for subsequent layers based on the value of the cell being expanded from.

**Metrics:**

Let's gather metrics for the failed examples using code execution.

Task: Grid value propagation from multiple seed locations

Objects:
  - Input_Grid:
      Type: 2D integer array
      Contains: Background value (0), Seed value (7)
      Structure: Primarily background values with one or more occurrences of the seed value.
  - Output_Grid:
      Type: 2D integer array
      Dimensions: Same as Input_Grid
      Contains: Background value (0), Propagation values (7, 8)
      Structure: A pattern of alternating propagation values expanding outwards from all initial seed locations.
  - Seed_Cells:
      Identification: All cells in the Input_Grid containing the Seed value (7).
      Properties: Set of (Row index, Column index) tuples. Value (7).
  - Propagation_Pattern:
      Values: Alternating sequence (7, 8, 7, 8, ...) based on the value of the source cell.
      Mechanism: Spreads outwards orthogonally (up, down, left, right) simultaneously from all Seed_Cells via Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Relationships:
  - Origin: The Propagation_Pattern in the Output_Grid originates from *all* Seed_Cells identified in the Input_Grid.
  - Overwrite: The Propagation_Pattern overwrites the initial background content (0s) of the Output_Grid cells it covers during propagation.
  - Fixed_Seeds: Cells corresponding to the Seed_Cells in the Input_Grid are assigned the value 7 in the Output_Grid and are not overwritten during propagation.
  - Adjacency_Rule: During propagation, orthogonally adjacent cells added to the pattern have alternating values (if the source cell is 7, its newly filled neighbors are 8; if the source is 8, its newly filled neighbors are 7).

Action:
  - Find_Seeds: Locate the row and column of *all* cells containing the Seed value (7) in the Input_Grid.
  - Initialize_Output: Create an Output_Grid of the same size as the Input_Grid, filled with the background value (0).
  - Initialize_Propagation:
      - Initialize a BFS queue.
      - Initialize a `visited` data structure (e.g., set or boolean grid).
      - For each seed cell `(seed_row, seed_col)` found:
          - Set `Output_Grid[seed_row][seed_col]` to 7.
          - Add `(seed_row, seed_col)` to `visited`.
          - Add `(seed_row, seed_col, 7)` to the BFS queue.
  - Propagate:
      - While the BFS queue is not empty:
          - Dequeue `(current_row, current_col, current_value)`.
          - Determine `next_value` (8 if `current_value` is 7, 7 if `current_value` is 8).
          - For each orthogonal neighbor `(neighbor_row, neighbor_col)`:
              - If the neighbor is within bounds and has not been visited:
                  - Set `Output_Grid[neighbor_row][neighbor_col]` to `next_value`.
                  - Mark `(neighbor_row, neighbor_col)` as visited.
                  - Enqueue `(neighbor_row, neighbor_col, next_value)`.
      - Termination: Continue until the BFS queue is empty.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid, `output_grid`, with the same dimensions as the `input_grid`, and initialize all its cells to 0.
2.  Initialize an empty list called `seed_locations` to store the coordinates of cells containing the value 7.
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the `input_grid`. If `input_grid[r][c]` is 7, add the tuple `(r, c)` to `seed_locations`.
4.  If `seed_locations` is empty, return the initialized `output_grid`.
5.  Initialize a queue data structure for Breadth-First Search (BFS).
6.  Initialize a data structure (e.g., a set of coordinate tuples or a boolean grid) called `visited` to keep track of processed cells.
7.  For each `(seed_row, seed_col)` in `seed_locations`:
    a.  Set the value of `output_grid[seed_row][seed_col]` to 7.
    b.  Add the coordinates `(seed_row, seed_col)` to `visited`.
    c.  Add the tuple `(seed_row, seed_col, 7)` representing (row, column, value) to the BFS queue.
8.  While the queue is not empty:
    a.  Dequeue the next element `(current_row, current_col, current_value)`.
    b.  Determine the `next_value` for neighbors: if `current_value` is 7, `next_value` is 8; otherwise (`current_value` is 8), `next_value` is 7.
    c.  Consider the four orthogonal neighbors: `(current_row - 1, current_col)`, `(current_row + 1, current_col)`, `(current_row, current_col - 1)`, `(current_row, current_col + 1)`.
    d.  For each neighbor `(neighbor_row, neighbor_col)`:
        i.   Check if `(neighbor_row, neighbor_col)` is within the valid bounds of the grid.
        ii.  Check if `(neighbor_row, neighbor_col)` has *not* been marked as `visited`.
        iii. If both checks pass:
             *   Set `output_grid[neighbor_row][neighbor_col]` to `next_value`.
             *   Mark `(neighbor_row, neighbor_col)` as `visited`.
             *   Enqueue the tuple `(neighbor_row, neighbor_col, next_value)`.
9.  Return the completed `output_grid`.
