Task: Grid value propagation based on Manhattan distance from a seed, limited by distance between extremal seeds.

Objects:
  - Input_Grid:
      Type: 2D integer array
      Contains: Background value (0), Seed marker value (7)
      Structure: Primarily background values with one or more occurrences of the seed marker value, typically forming a vertical line.
  - Output_Grid:
      Type: 2D integer array
      Dimensions: Same as Input_Grid
      Contains: Background value (0), Propagation values (7, 8)
      Structure: A pattern of alternating propagation values forming a diamond shape centered on the Seed_Cell location, replacing original values up to a certain distance limit.
  - Seed_Cell:
      Identification: The cell in the Input_Grid containing the Seed marker value (7) with the minimum row index (topmost). If multiple 7s exist in the minimum row, the one with the minimum column index is chosen (though examples only show one per row).
      Properties: Row index (seed_row), Column index (seed_col), Value (7).
  - Limit_Cell:
      Identification: The cell in the Input_Grid containing the Seed marker value (7) with the maximum row index (bottommost). If multiple 7s exist in the maximum row, the one with the maximum column index is chosen (though examples only show one per row).
      Properties: Row index (limit_row), Column index (limit_col), Value (7).
  - Max_Distance:
      Calculation: The Manhattan distance between the Seed_Cell and the Limit_Cell. `max_dist = abs(seed_row - limit_row) + abs(seed_col - limit_col)`.
  - Propagation_Pattern:
      Values: Determined by Manhattan distance (`dist`) from the Seed_Cell. Value is 7 if `dist` is even, 8 if `dist` is odd.
      Mechanism: Applied to all cells `(r, c)` in the Output_Grid where the Manhattan distance `dist = abs(r - seed_row) + abs(c - seed_col)` is less than or equal to `Max_Distance`.

Relationships:
  - Origin: The center of the Propagation_Pattern in the Output_Grid is the Seed_Cell identified in the Input_Grid.
  - Limit: The extent of the Propagation_Pattern is determined by the Max_Distance calculated from the Input_Grid.
  - Value Assignment: The value (7 or 8) at a cell within the pattern depends on the parity of its Manhattan distance from the Seed_Cell.
  - Overwrite: The Propagation_Pattern overwrites the initial background value (0) of the Output_Grid cells it covers. Cells outside the Max_Distance remain 0.

Action:
  - Find_Extremal_Seeds: Locate the coordinates `(seed_row, seed_col)` of the topmost Seed marker value (7) and `(limit_row, limit_col)` of the bottommost Seed marker value (7) in the Input_Grid.
  - Handle_No_Seed: If no Seed marker value (7) is found, return an Output_Grid of the same size filled with the background value (0).
  - Calculate_Max_Distance: Compute the Manhattan distance `max_dist` between `(seed_row, seed_col)` and `(limit_row, limit_col)`.
  - Initialize_Output: Create an Output_Grid of the same size as the Input_Grid, filled with the background value (0).
  - Populate_Pattern: Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the Output_Grid:
      - Calculate the Manhattan distance `dist` from `(seed_row, seed_col)` to `(r, c)`.
      - If `dist <= max_dist`:
          - Assign 7 to `Output_Grid[r][c]` if `dist` is even.
          - Assign 8 to `Output_Grid[r][c]` if `dist` is odd.
