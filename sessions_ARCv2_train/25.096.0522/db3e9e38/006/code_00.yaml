Task: Grid value propagation based on seed location and column parity within distance limit

Objects:
  - Input_Grid:
      Type: 2D integer array
      Contains: Background value (0), Seed marker (7)
      Structure: Primarily background values with one or more occurrences of the seed marker, typically forming a vertical line.
  - Output_Grid:
      Type: 2D integer array
      Dimensions: Same as Input_Grid
      Contains: Background value (0), Propagation values (7, 8)
      Structure: A diamond-like pattern of alternating propagation values expanding from a specific point, replacing original values within a calculated boundary.
  - Seed_Cell:
      Identification: The topmost (first encountered in row-major scan) cell in the Input_Grid containing the Seed marker (7).
      Properties: Row index (seed_row), Column index (seed_col).
  - Limit_Cell:
      Identification: The bottommost (last encountered in row-major scan) cell in the Input_Grid containing the Seed marker (7).
      Properties: Row index (limit_row), Column index (limit_col).
      Note: If only one '7' exists, Limit_Cell is the same as Seed_Cell.
  - Propagation_Boundary:
      Type: Manhattan Distance
      Calculation: `max_dist = abs(seed_row - limit_row) + abs(seed_col - limit_col)`
  - Propagation_Pattern:
      Values: 7 or 8
      Rule: Determined by the column parity relative to the Seed_Cell's column index.
      Condition: Applies only to cells within the Propagation_Boundary.

Relationships:
  - Origin: The Propagation_Pattern in the Output_Grid originates conceptually from the Seed_Cell.
  - Boundary_Definition: The extent of the Propagation_Pattern is limited by the Manhattan distance (`max_dist`) between the Seed_Cell and the Limit_Cell.
  - Value_Assignment: For a cell `(r, c)` within the Propagation_Boundary (i.e., `manhattan_distance((r, c), Seed_Cell) <= max_dist`), its value in the Output_Grid is 7 if `abs(c - seed_col)` is even, and 8 if `abs(c - seed_col)` is odd.
  - Background: Cells outside the Propagation_Boundary retain the Background value (0).
  - Overwrite: The Propagation_Pattern overwrites the initial content (0s or input 7s) of the Output_Grid cells it covers.

Action:
  - Find_Extremal_Seeds: Scan the Input_Grid to find the coordinates of the Seed_Cell `(seed_row, seed_col)` and the Limit_Cell `(limit_row, limit_col)`. Handle the case where no '7' is found or only one '7' is found.
  - Calculate_Max_Distance: Compute the Manhattan distance `max_dist` between Seed_Cell and Limit_Cell.
  - Initialize_Output: Create an Output_Grid of the same size as the Input_Grid, filled with the background value (0).
  - Apply_Pattern: Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the grid:
      - Calculate current Manhattan distance: `dist = abs(r - seed_row) + abs(c - seed_col)`.
      - If `dist <= max_dist`:
          - Calculate column distance: `col_dist = abs(c - seed_col)`.
          - If `col_dist % 2 == 0`: set `Output_Grid[r][c] = 7`.
          - Else (`col_dist % 2 == 1`): set `Output_Grid[r][c] = 8`.
  - Return_Output: Provide the completed Output_Grid.
