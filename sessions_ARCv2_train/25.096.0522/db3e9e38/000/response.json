            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.    **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) of integers. The dimensions seem to remain consistent between input and output for each example.\n2.  **Key Input Feature:** The input grids contain mostly zeros but have a distinct vertical line composed of the number 7.\n3.  **Output Pattern:** The output grids also contain zeros, 7s, and a new number, 8. The 7s and 8s form a pattern that seems to originate from the location of the input line of 7s but expands outwards. The original line of 7s in the input is not directly preserved, except potentially the topmost '7'.\n4.  **Propagation:** The pattern in the output looks like a wave or propagation spreading from a starting point. The values alternate between 7 and 8 as the pattern spreads.\n5.  **Starting Point:** Comparing the two examples, the pattern seems to consistently start from the *topmost* '7' found in the input grid.\n6.  **Alternating Values:** Cells adjacent (orthogonally) to a '7' in the output pattern become '8', and cells adjacent to an '8' become '7', provided they haven't been filled yet. This suggests a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or similar layer-by-layer expansion where the value depends on the value of the cell from which it's expanding.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Scan the `input_grid` row by row, then column by column, to find the coordinates `(seed_row, seed_col)` of the first cell encountered that contains the value 7.\n3.  If no cell with the value 7 is found in the `input_grid`, return the initialized `output_grid`.\n4.  If a seed cell `(seed_row, seed_col)` is found:\n    a.  Initialize a queue data structure for Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n    b.  Initialize a data structure (e.g., a set of coordinate tuples or a boolean grid) called `visited` to keep track of cells that have been assigned a value and added to the queue.\n    c.  Set the value of `output_grid[seed_row][seed_col]` to 7.\n    d.  Add the tuple `(seed_row, seed_col, 7)` representing (row, column, value) to the queue.\n    e.  Add the coordinates `(seed_row, seed_col)` to `visited`.\n    f.  While the queue is not empty:\n        i.   Dequeue the next element `(current_row, current_col, current_value)`.\n        ii.  Determine the `next_value` for neighbors: if `current_value` is 7, `next_value` is 8; otherwise, `next_value` is 7.\n        iii. Consider the four orthogonal neighbors: `(current_row - 1, current_col)`, `(current_row + 1, current_col)`, `(current_row, current_col - 1)`, `(current_row, current_col + 1)`.\n        iv.  For each neighbor `(neighbor_row, neighbor_col)`:\n             1. Check if `(neighbor_row, neighbor_col)` is within the valid bounds of the grid.\n             2. Check if `(neighbor_row, neighbor_col)` has *not* been marked as `visited`.\n             3.
