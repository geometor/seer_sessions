Task: Grid value propagation based on seed location

Objects:
  - Input_Grid:
      Type: 2D integer array
      Contains: Background value (0), Seed value (7)
      Structure: Primarily background values with one or more occurrences of the seed value, often forming a vertical line.
  - Output_Grid:
      Type: 2D integer array
      Dimensions: Same as Input_Grid
      Contains: Background value (0), Propagation values (7, 8)
      Structure: A pattern of alternating propagation values expanding from a specific point, replacing original values.
  - Seed_Cell:
      Identification: The topmost cell in the Input_Grid containing the Seed value (7).
      Properties: Row index, Column index, Value (7).
  - Propagation_Pattern:
      Values: Alternating sequence (7, 8, 7, 8, ...)
      Mechanism: Spreads outwards orthogonally (up, down, left, right) from the Seed_Cell.

Relationships:
  - Origin: The Propagation_Pattern in the Output_Grid originates from the Seed_Cell identified in the Input_Grid.
  - Overwrite: The Propagation_Pattern overwrites the initial content (0s or other 7s from the input) of the Output_Grid cells it covers.
  - Adjacency_Rule: Orthogonally adjacent cells in the Propagation_Pattern have alternating values (if one is 7, its newly filled neighbors are 8, and vice-versa).

Action:
  - Find_Seed: Locate the row and column of the topmost Seed value (7) in the Input_Grid.
  - Initialize_Output: Create an Output_Grid of the same size as the Input_Grid, filled with the background value (0).
  - Propagate:
      Starting_Condition: Place the Seed value (7) at the Seed_Cell location in the Output_Grid.
      Process: Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the Seed_Cell.
      Rule: For each cell visited, assign the alternating value (8 if current is 7, 7 if current is 8) to its unvisited orthogonal neighbors within the grid boundaries. Mark neighbors as visited and add them to the BFS queue.
      Termination: Continue until the BFS queue is empty.
