Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

### Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input:** A single string containing space-separated single digits. The sequence starts with one or more instances of the same non-zero digit, followed by zero or more zeros.
2.  **Output:** Multiple lines of space-separated single digits.
    *   The first line of the output is always identical to the input string.
    *   Each subsequent line is derived from the previous line.
    *   The transformation involves changing one '0' digit to the non-zero digit found at the beginning of the sequence in each step.
    *   The process starts by changing the first '0' encountered after the initial block of non-zero digits.
    *   The number of transformation steps (and thus the number of output lines beyond the first) varies between examples and depends on the input sequence.
3.  **Transformation Logic:** The core action is the progressive replacement of zeros with the initial non-zero digit. The key is to determine *how many* zeros are replaced. By analyzing the number of initial non-zero digits (N), the number of zeros (Z), and the total length (L=N+Z), a pattern emerges for the number of transformation steps (C).
    *   If the initial count of non-zero digits (N) is greater than the count of zeros (Z), all zeros are replaced (C=Z).
    *   Otherwise (if N <= Z), the process continues until the total count of the non-zero digit reaches a target value, calculated as `floor(L / 2) + N - 1`. The number of steps C is then `target_N - N`.

### Facts


```yaml
Objects:
  - Input_Sequence:
      type: List[int]
      description: A sequence of single digits derived from the input string.
  - Output_Sequences:
      type: List[List[int]]
      description: A list containing multiple sequences of digits, representing the lines of the output.

Properties:
  - dominant_digit (d):
      type: int
      description: The non-zero digit present at the beginning of the Input_Sequence.
  - initial_non_zero_count (N):
      type: int
      description: The number of occurrences of 'd' at the start of the Input_Sequence.
  - zero_count (Z):
      type: int
      description: The number of zeros in the Input_Sequence.
  - total_length (L):
      type: int
      description: The total number of digits in the Input_Sequence (L = N + Z).
  - target_non_zero_count (target_N):
      type: int
      description: The final number of 'd' digits present in the last Output_Sequence line. Calculated based on N, Z, and L.
  - transformation_steps (C):
      type: int
      description: The number of zeros replaced (C = target_N - N). Also, the number of output lines minus one.

Relationships:
  - L = N + Z
  - if N > Z:
      target_N = L
  - if N <= Z:
      target_N = floor(L / 2) + N - 1  # Using integer division for floor
  - C = target_N - N
  - Output_Sequences[0] == Input_Sequence
  - For i from 1 to C:
      Output_Sequences[i] is derived from Output_Sequences[i-1] by changing the digit at index (N + i - 1) from 0 to 'd'.

Actions:
  - Parse: Convert the input string into Input_Sequence (list of integers).
  - Identify: Determine 'd', 'N', 'Z', 'L' from Input_Sequence.
  - Calculate: Compute 'target_N' using the conditional logic based on N, Z, L. Compute 'C'.
  - Generate:
    - Initialize Output_Sequences with Input_Sequence.
    - Iterate 'C' times:
      - Copy the last sequence in Output_Sequences.
      - Modify the copy by changing the digit at index (N + current_step) to 'd'.
      - Append the modified copy to Output_Sequences.
  - Format: Convert each sequence in Output_Sequences back to a space-separated string for the final output.
```


### Natural Language Program

1.  Read the input string and parse it into a list of integers (let's call it `current_sequence`).
2.  Add `current_sequence` as the first line of the result.
3.  Identify the first digit in `current_sequence`; this is the `dominant_digit`.
4.  Count the number of initial occurrences of the `dominant_digit` (let this be `N`).
5.  Count the number of zeros in `current_sequence` (let this be `Z`).
6.  Calculate the total length `L = N + Z`.
7.  Determine the target number of `dominant_digit`s (`target_N`) for the final state:
    *   If `N` is greater than `Z`, set `target_N` to `L`.
    *   Otherwise (if `N` is less than or equal to `Z`), set `target_N` to `(L // 2) + N - 1` (using integer division for floor).
8.  Calculate the number of transformation steps required: `C = target_N - N`.
9.  Iterate `C` times (from step `i = 0` to `C-1`):
    a.  Find the index to modify: `index = N + i`.
    b.  Change the digit in `current_sequence` at the calculated `index` from 0 to the `dominant_digit`.
    c.  Add a copy of the modified `current_sequence` as the next line of the result.
10. Format the collected result lines into the required output string format (multiple lines of space-separated digits).
```python
import math

"""
The transformation takes a single sequence of digits as input. This sequence starts with N repetitions of a non-zero digit 'd', followed by Z zeros. 
The output consists of multiple sequences. 
The first output sequence is identical to the input sequence. 
Subsequent sequences are generated iteratively. In each step, the next zero in the sequence (starting from the position immediately after the initial block of 'd's) is replaced by 'd'. 
This process continues for a specific number of steps, C.
The number of steps C is determined as follows:
1. Calculate the total length L = N + Z.
2. Determine the target count of the dominant digit 'd' (target_N) in the final sequence:
   - If N > Z, target_N = L (all zeros are replaced).
   - If N <= Z, target_N = floor(L / 2) + N - 1.
3. The number of transformation steps (zeros to replace) is C = target_N - N.
The final output contains C+1 sequences (the initial one plus the C transformed ones).
