"""
The transformation takes a single sequence of digits as input. This sequence starts with N repetitions of a non-zero digit 'd', followed by Z zeros. 
The output consists of multiple sequences. 
The first output sequence is identical to the input sequence. 
Subsequent sequences are generated iteratively. In each step, the next zero in the sequence (starting from the position immediately after the initial block of 'd's) is replaced by 'd'. 
This process continues for a specific number of steps, C.
The number of steps C is determined as follows:
1. Calculate the total length L = N + Z.
2. Determine the target count of the dominant digit 'd' (target_N) in the final sequence:
   - If N > Z, target_N = L (all zeros are replaced).
   - If N <= Z, target_N = floor(L / 2) + N - 1.
3. The number of transformation steps (zeros to replace) is C = target_N - N.
The final output contains C+1 sequences (the initial one plus the C transformed ones).
