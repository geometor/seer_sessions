Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

### Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input:** A single string containing space-separated single digits. The sequence starts with one or more instances of the same non-zero digit, followed by zero or more zeros.
2.  **Output:** Multiple lines of space-separated single digits.
    *   The first line of the output is always identical to the input string.
    *   Each subsequent line is derived from the previous line.
    *   The transformation involves changing one '0' digit to the non-zero digit found at the beginning of the sequence in each step.
    *   The process starts by changing the first '0' encountered after the initial block of non-zero digits.
    *   The number of transformation steps (and thus the number of output lines beyond the first) varies between examples and depends on the input sequence.
3.  **Transformation Logic:** The core action is the progressive replacement of zeros with the initial non-zero digit. The key is to determine *how many* zeros are replaced. By analyzing the number of initial non-zero digits (N), the number of zeros (Z), and the total length (L=N+Z), a pattern emerges for the number of transformation steps (C).
    *   If the initial count of non-zero digits (N) is greater than the count of zeros (Z), all zeros are replaced (C=Z).
    *   Otherwise (if N <= Z), the process continues until the total count of the non-zero digit reaches a target value, calculated as `floor(L / 2) + N - 1`. The number of steps C is then `target_N - N`.

### Facts


```yaml
Objects:
  - Input_Sequence:
      type: List[int]
      description: A sequence of single digits derived from the input string.
  - Output_Sequences:
      type: List[List[int]]
      description: A list containing multiple sequences of digits, representing the lines of the output.

Properties:
  - dominant_digit (d):
      type: int
      description: The non-zero digit present at the beginning of the Input_Sequence.
  - initial_non_zero_count (N):
      type: int
      description: The number of occurrences of 'd' at the start of the Input_Sequence.
  - zero_count (Z):
      type: int
      description: The number of zeros in the Input_Sequence.
  - total_length (L):
      type: int
      description: The total number of digits in the Input_Sequence (L = N + Z).
  - target_non_zero_count (target_N):
      type: int
      description: The final number of 'd' digits present in the last Output_Sequence line. Calculated based on N, Z, and L.
  - transformation_steps (C):
      type: int
      description: The number of zeros replaced (C = target_N - N). Also, the number of output lines minus one.

Relationships:
  - L = N + Z
  - if N > Z:
      target_N = L
  - if N <= Z:
      target_N = floor(L / 2) + N - 1  # Using integer division for floor
  - C = target_N - N
  - Output_Sequences[0] == Input_Sequence
  - For i from 1 to C:
      Output_Sequences[i] is derived from Output_Sequences[i-1] by changing the digit at index (N + i - 1) from 0 to 'd'.

Actions:
  - Parse: Convert the input string into Input_Sequence (list of integers).
  - Identify: Determine 'd', 'N', 'Z', 'L' from Input_Sequence.
  - Calculate: Compute 'target_N' using the conditional logic based on N, Z, L. Compute 'C'.
  - Generate:
    - Initialize Output_Sequences with Input_Sequence.
    - Iterate 'C' times:
      - Copy the last sequence in Output_Sequences.
      - Modify the copy by changing the digit at index (N + current_step) to 'd'.
      - Append the modified copy to Output_Sequences.
  - Format: Convert each sequence in Output_Sequences back to a space-separated string for the final output.
```


### Natural Language Program

1.  Read the input string and parse it into a list of integers (let's call it `current_sequence`).
2.  Add `current_sequence` as the first line of the result.
3.  Identify the first digit in `current_sequence`; this is the `dominant_digit`.
4.  Count the number of initial occurrences of the `dominant_digit` (let this be `N`).
5.  Count the number of zeros in `current_sequence` (let this be `Z`).
6.  Calculate the total length `L = N + Z`.
7.  Determine the target number of `dominant_digit`s (`target_N`) for the final state:
    *   If `N` is greater than `Z`, set `target_N` to `L`.
    *   Otherwise (if `N` is less than or equal to `Z`), set `target_N` to `(L // 2) + N - 1` (using integer division for floor).
8.  Calculate the number of transformation steps required: `C = target_N - N`.
9.  Iterate `C` times (from step `i = 0` to `C-1`):
    a.  Find the index to modify: `index = N + i`.
    b.  Change the digit in `current_sequence` at the calculated `index` from 0 to the `dominant_digit`.
    c.  Add a copy of the modified `current_sequence` as the next line of the result.
10. Format the collected result lines into the required output string format (multiple lines of space-separated digits).
