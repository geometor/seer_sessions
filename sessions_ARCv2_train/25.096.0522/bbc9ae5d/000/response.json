The sequence starts with one or more instances of the same non-zero digit, followed by zero or more zeros.\n2.  **Output:** Multiple lines of space-separated single digits.\n    *   The first line of the output is always identical to the input string.\n    *   Each subsequent line is derived from the previous line.\n    *   The transformation involves changing one '0' digit to the non-zero digit found at the beginning of the sequence in each step.\n    *   The process starts by changing the first '0' encountered after the initial block of non-zero digits.\n    *   The number of transformation steps (and thus the number of output lines beyond the first) varies between examples and depends on the input sequence.\n3.  **Transformation Logic:** The core action is the progressive replacement of zeros with the initial non-zero digit. The key is to determine *how many* zeros are replaced. By analyzing the number of initial non-zero digits (N), the number of zeros (Z), and the total length (L=N+Z), a pattern emerges for the number of transformation steps (C).\n    *   If the initial count of non-zero digits (N) is greater than the count of zeros (Z), all zeros are replaced (C=Z).\n    *   Otherwise (if N <= Z), the process continues until the total count of the non-zero digit reaches a target value, calculated as `floor(L / 2) + N - 1`. The number of steps C is then `target_N - N`.\n\n### Facts\n\n"
