Objects:
  - Input_Sequence:
      type: List[int]
      description: A sequence of single digits derived from the input string.
  - Output_Sequences:
      type: List[List[int]]
      description: A list containing multiple sequences of digits, representing the lines of the output.

Properties:
  - dominant_digit (d):
      type: int
      description: The non-zero digit present at the beginning of the Input_Sequence.
  - initial_non_zero_count (N):
      type: int
      description: The number of occurrences of 'd' at the start of the Input_Sequence.
  - zero_count (Z):
      type: int
      description: The number of zeros in the Input_Sequence.
  - total_length (L):
      type: int
      description: The total number of digits in the Input_Sequence (L = N + Z).
  - target_non_zero_count (target_N):
      type: int
      description: The final number of 'd' digits present in the last Output_Sequence line. Calculated based on N, Z, and L.
  - transformation_steps (C):
      type: int
      description: The number of zeros replaced (C = target_N - N). Also, the number of output lines minus one.

Relationships:
  - L = N + Z
  - if N > Z:
      target_N = L
  - if N <= Z:
      target_N = floor(L / 2) + N - 1  # Using integer division for floor
  - C = target_N - N
  - Output_Sequences[0] == Input_Sequence
  - For i from 1 to C:
      Output_Sequences[i] is derived from Output_Sequences[i-1] by changing the digit at index (N + i - 1) from 0 to 'd'.

Actions:
  - Parse: Convert the input string into Input_Sequence (list of integers).
  - Identify: Determine 'd', 'N', 'Z', 'L' from Input_Sequence.
  - Calculate: Compute 'target_N' using the conditional logic based on N, Z, L. Compute 'C'.
  - Generate:
    - Initialize Output_Sequences with Input_Sequence.
    - Iterate 'C' times:
      - Copy the last sequence in Output_Sequences.
      - Modify the copy by changing the digit at index (N + current_step) to 'd'.
      - Append the modified copy to Output_Sequences.
  - Format: Convert each sequence in Output_Sequences back to a space-separated string for the final output.
