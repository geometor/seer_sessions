Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

### Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input:** A single string containing space-separated single digits. The sequence starts with one or more instances of the same non-zero digit, followed by zero or more zeros.
2.  **Output:** Multiple lines of space-separated single digits.
    *   The first line of the output is always identical to the input string.
    *   Each subsequent line is derived from the previous line.
    *   The transformation involves changing one '0' digit to the non-zero digit found at the beginning of the sequence in each step.
    *   The process starts by changing the first '0' encountered after the initial block of non-zero digits.
    *   The number of transformation steps (and thus the number of output lines beyond the first) varies between examples and depends on the input sequence.
3.  **Transformation Logic:** The core action is the progressive replacement of zeros with the initial non-zero digit. The key is to determine *how many* zeros are replaced. By analyzing the number of initial non-zero digits (N), the number of zeros (Z), and the total length (L=N+Z), a pattern emerges for the number of transformation steps (C).
    *   If the initial count of non-zero digits (N) is greater than the count of zeros (Z), all zeros are replaced (C=Z).
    *   Otherwise (if N <= Z), the process continues until the total count of the non-zero digit reaches a target value, calculated as `floor(L / 2) + N - 1`. The number of steps C is then `target_N - N`.

### Facts


```yaml
Objects:
  - Input_Sequence:
      type: List[int]
      description: A sequence of single digits derived from the input string.
  - Output_Sequences:
      type: List[List[int]]
      description: A list containing multiple sequences of digits, representing the lines of the output.

Properties:
  - dominant_digit (d):
      type: int
      description: The non-zero digit present at the beginning of the Input_Sequence.
  - initial_non_zero_count (N):
      type: int
      description: The number of occurrences of 'd' at the start of the Input_Sequence.
  - zero_count (Z):
      type: int
      description: The number of zeros in the Input_Sequence.
  - total_length (L):
      type: int
      description: The total number of digits in the Input_Sequence (L = N + Z).
  - target_non_zero_count (target_N):
      type: int
      description: The final number of 'd' digits present in the last Output_Sequence line. Calculated based on N, Z, and L.
  - transformation_steps (C):
      type: int
      description: The number of zeros replaced (C = target_N - N). Also, the number of output lines minus one.

Relationships:
  - L = N + Z
  - if N > Z:
      target_N = L
  - if N <= Z:
      target_N = floor(L / 2) + N - 1  # Using integer division for floor
  - C = target_N - N
  - Output_Sequences[0] == Input_Sequence
  - For i from 1 to C:
      Output_Sequences[i] is derived from Output_Sequences[i-1] by changing the digit at index (N + i - 1) from 0 to 'd'.

Actions:
  - Parse: Convert the input string into Input_Sequence (list of integers).
  - Identify: Determine 'd', 'N', 'Z', 'L' from Input_Sequence.
  - Calculate: Compute 'target_N' using the conditional logic based on N, Z, L. Compute 'C'.
  - Generate:
    - Initialize Output_Sequences with Input_Sequence.
    - Iterate 'C' times:
      - Copy the last sequence in Output_Sequences.
      - Modify the copy by changing the digit at index (N + current_step) to 'd'.
      - Append the modified copy to Output_Sequences.
  - Format: Convert each sequence in Output_Sequences back to a space-separated string for the final output.
```


### Natural Language Program

1.  Read the input string and parse it into a list of integers (let's call it `current_sequence`).
2.  Add `current_sequence` as the first line of the result.
3.  Identify the first digit in `current_sequence`; this is the `dominant_digit`.
4.  Count the number of initial occurrences of the `dominant_digit` (let this be `N`).
5.  Count the number of zeros in `current_sequence` (let this be `Z`).
6.  Calculate the total length `L = N + Z`.
7.  Determine the target number of `dominant_digit`s (`target_N`) for the final state:
    *   If `N` is greater than `Z`, set `target_N` to `L`.
    *   Otherwise (if `N` is less than or equal to `Z`), set `target_N` to `(L // 2) + N - 1` (using integer division for floor).
8.  Calculate the number of transformation steps required: `C = target_N - N`.
9.  Iterate `C` times (from step `i = 0` to `C-1`):
    a.  Find the index to modify: `index = N + i`.
    b.  Change the digit in `current_sequence` at the calculated `index` from 0 to the `dominant_digit`.
    c.  Add a copy of the modified `current_sequence` as the next line of the result.
10. Format the collected result lines into the required output string format (multiple lines of space-separated digits).
```python
import math

"""
The transformation takes a single sequence of digits as input. This sequence starts with N repetitions of a non-zero digit 'd', followed by Z zeros. 
The output consists of multiple sequences. 
The first output sequence is identical to the input sequence. 
Subsequent sequences are generated iteratively. In each step, the next zero in the sequence (starting from the position immediately after the initial block of 'd's) is replaced by 'd'. 
This process continues for a specific number of steps, C.
The number of steps C is determined as follows:
1. Calculate the total length L = N + Z.
2. Determine the target count of the dominant digit 'd' (target_N) in the final sequence:
   - If N > Z, target_N = L (all zeros are replaced).
   - If N <= Z, target_N = floor(L / 2) + N - 1.
3. The number of transformation steps (zeros to replace) is C = target_N - N.
The final output contains C+1 sequences (the initial one plus the C transformed ones).

The transformation processes a sequence of single digits provided as a space-separated string.
The sequence typically starts with N repetitions of a non-zero digit 'd', followed by Z zeros.
The output consists of multiple lines (strings), representing the sequence at different stages.
The first output line is identical to the input sequence.
Subsequent lines are generated iteratively by replacing zeros with the dominant digit 'd'.
In each step, the zero at the position immediately following the previously modified position (or the initial block of 'd's) is changed to 'd'.
This process continues for a specific number of steps, C.

The number of steps C is determined as follows:
1. Identify N (initial count of 'd'), Z (count of zeros), and L (total length).
2. Calculate the number of steps C:
   - If N > Z, then C = Z (all zeros are replaced).

3. Ensure C is non-negative and does not exceed the number of available zeros (C = max(0, min(C, Z))).
The final output contains C + 1 lines: the initial sequence plus the C transformed sequences, formatted as strings.

## Assessment and Strategy

**General Assessment:**
The primary issue identified is a `TypeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'strip'`, occurring within the `parse_input_string` function. This strongly suggests that the `transform` function, despite being type-hinted to accept a string (`input_str: str`), is being called with a list object by the testing environment. The core transformation logic (calculating the number of steps `C` based on `N`, `Z`, `L`) appears consistent with the examples when manually checked.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Input Handling:** Modify the beginning of the `transform` function to gracefully handle inputs that might already be lists (e.g., `list[int]` or `list[str]`) in addition to the expected `str` format. If the input is a string, proceed with parsing. If it's a list, bypass parsing and use it directly, ensuring elements are integers if necessary.
2.  **Verification:** Use `tool_code` to systematically calculate N (initial non-zero count), Z (zero count), L (length), and the expected number of transformation steps C (output lines - 1) for each training example to confirm the derived rules:
    *   If N > Z, C = Z.
    *   If N <= Z, C = (L // 2) - 1.
3.  **Refinement:** Update the YAML facts and the natural language program to accurately reflect the confirmed logic and the necessary input handling flexibility.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's verify N, Z, L, and the expected C for each example.

```
**Metrics Summary:**
The calculated `Expected C` using the rules (if N > Z, C = Z; else C = L // 2 - 1) perfectly matches the `Actual C` derived from the number of output lines in every training example. This confirms the transformation step calculation logic is correct. The primary focus remains fixing the input type handling.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
Objects:
  - Input_Data:
      type: Union[str, List[int], List[str]]
      description: Input sequence, potentially as a space-separated string or a pre-parsed list.
  - Input_Sequence:
      type: List[int]
      description: The sequence of digits derived from Input_Data, used for processing.
  - Output_Sequences:
      type: List[List[int]]
      description: A list storing the initial sequence and all transformed sequences as lists of integers.
  - Formatted_Output:
      type: List[str]
      description: The final output, where each sequence from Output_Sequences is formatted as a space-separated string.

Properties:
  - dominant_digit (d):
      type: int
      description: The non-zero digit present at the beginning of Input_Sequence.
  - initial_non_zero_count (N):
      type: int
      description: The number of occurrences of 'd' at the start of Input_Sequence.
  - zero_count (Z):
      type: int
      description: The total number of zeros in Input_Sequence.
  - total_length (L):
      type: int
      description: The total number of digits in Input_Sequence (L = N + Z).
  - transformation_steps (C):
      type: int
      description: The number of zeros to replace. Calculated based on N, Z, L.

Relationships:
  - L = N + Z (typically holds true for valid inputs)
  - Calculation of C:
    - if N > Z: C = Z
    - if N <= Z: C = (L // 2) - 1
  - Constraints on C: C = max(0, min(C, Z)) # Ensure C is non-negative and doesn't exceed available zeros.
  - Output_Sequences[0] == Input_Sequence
  - For i from 1 to C:
      Output_Sequences[i] is derived from a copy of Output_Sequences[i-1] by changing the digit at index (N + i - 1) from 0 to 'd'.

Actions:
  - Input_Normalization:
      description: Check the type of Input_Data. If it's a string, parse it into Input_Sequence (List[int]). If it's a list, use it directly (ensure elements are integers). Handle potential errors.
  - Analyze: Determine 'd', 'N', 'Z', 'L' from Input_Sequence.
  - Calculate_Steps: Compute 'C' using the conditional logic based on N, Z, L, applying constraints.
  - Generate_Transformations:
    - Initialize Output_Sequences with a copy of Input_Sequence.
    - Create a working copy of Input_Sequence.
    - Iterate 'C' times (from step index `i = 0` to `C-1`):
      - Calculate the target index: `idx = N + i`.
      - If `idx` is valid and `working_copy[idx]` is 0:
          - Modify `working_copy[idx]` to 'd'.
          - Append a new copy of `working_copy` to Output_Sequences.
      - Else (index invalid or not zero), break the loop.
  - Format_Output: Convert each sequence in Output_Sequences into a space-separated string for Formatted_Output.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Receive Input:** Accept the input data, which might be a single string of space-separated digits or potentially an already parsed list of digits (as strings or integers).
2.  **Normalize Input:**
    *   If the input is a string, parse it into a list of integers (`Input_Sequence`). Handle potential non-digit characters or empty strings gracefully.
    *   If the input is a list, ensure its elements are integers and use it as `Input_Sequence`.
    *   If normalization fails or results in an empty sequence, return an empty list or handle appropriately.
3.  **Initialize Output:** Create a list (`Output_Sequences`) to store the results. Add a copy of the initial `Input_Sequence` as the first element.
4.  **Analyze Sequence:**
    *   Identify the first non-zero digit (`dominant_digit`, `d`).
    *   Count the number of initial consecutive occurrences of `d` (`N`).
    *   Count the total number of zeros (`Z`).
    *   Determine the total length of the sequence (`L`).
    *   Handle edge cases like all-zero sequences (where C will be 0).
5.  **Calculate Transformation Steps:**
    *   Determine the number of steps (`C`) based on `N`, `Z`, and `L`:
        *   If `N` is greater than `Z`, set `C = Z`.
        *   If `N` is less than or equal to `Z`, set `C = (L // 2) - 1` (using integer division).
    *   Adjust `C`: Ensure `C` is not negative (`max(0, C)`) and does not exceed the number of available zeros (`min(C, Z)`).
6.  **Generate Transformations:**
    *   Create a mutable copy of `Input_Sequence` (let's call it `working_sequence`).
    *   Loop `C` times, using a step counter `i` from 0 to `C-1`:
        a.  Calculate the index to modify: `index = N + i`.
        b.  Check if `index` is within the bounds of `working_sequence` and if the element at `working_sequence[index]` is 0.
        c.  If the conditions in (b) are met:
            i.  Change the digit at `working_sequence[index]` to `dominant_digit`.
            ii. Append a *new copy* of the current state of `working_sequence` to `Output_Sequences`.
        d.  If the conditions in (b) are *not* met (e.g., index out of bounds, or the element is not zero), stop the transformation loop prematurely.
7.  **Format Output:** Convert each list of integers in `Output_Sequences` into a space-separated string.
8.  **Return Result:** Return the list of formatted strings.
