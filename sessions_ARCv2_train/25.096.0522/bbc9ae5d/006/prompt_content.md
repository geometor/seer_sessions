"""
The transformation processes a sequence of single digits provided as a space-separated string.
The sequence typically starts with N repetitions of a non-zero digit 'd', followed by Z zeros.
The output consists of multiple lines (strings), representing the sequence at different stages.
The first output line is identical to the input sequence.
Subsequent lines are generated iteratively by replacing zeros with the dominant digit 'd'.
In each step, the zero at the position immediately following the previously modified position (or the initial block of 'd's) is changed to 'd'.
This process continues for a specific number of steps, C.

The number of steps C is determined as follows:
1. Identify N (initial count of 'd'), Z (count of zeros), and L (total length).
2. Calculate the number of steps C:
   - If N > Z, then C = Z (all zeros are replaced).
   - If N <= Z, then C = (L // 2) - 1 (integer division for floor).
3. Ensure C is non-negative and does not exceed the number of available zeros (C = max(0, min(C, Z))).
The final output contains C + 1 lines: the initial sequence plus the C transformed sequences, formatted as strings.
