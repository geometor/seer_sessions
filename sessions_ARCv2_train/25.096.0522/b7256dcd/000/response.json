            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of numbers. The grid dimensions are preserved in each example (5x5 for train_1, 6x4 for train_2).\n2.  **Color Palette:** The numbers likely represent colors. The dominant color is `7` (background/neutral). Color `6` appears frequently and is the primary subject of transformations. Colors `1`, `3`, and `4` act as \"active\" colors or sources.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The central logic revolves around how the color `6` changes based on its adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n4.  **Source Color Behavior:** The active colors (`1`, `3`, `4`) seem to influence adjacent `6`s. If they successfully influence a `6`, the original source color cell turns into the background color `7`. If they are not adjacent to any `6`, they also turn into `7`.\n5.  **Connected Components:** Groups of connected `6`s (sharing horizontal or vertical borders) seem to behave as a single unit when determining their transformation.\n6.  **Conditional Rule for `6`:**\n    *   If a component of `6`s is adjacent to exactly one unique active color (non-`6`, non-`7`), all `6`s in that component adopt that active color.\n    *   If a component of `6`s is *not* adjacent to any active color (i.e., only adjacent to `7`s or other `6`s within the same component), its fate depends on whether the color `4` exists anywhere in the *input* grid:\n        *   If `4` exists in the input grid (as seen in train_1), these isolated `6`s change to `4`.\n        *   If `4` does *not* exist in the input grid (as seen in train_2), these isolated `6`s remain unchanged (`6`).\n7.  **Background Stability:** The background color `7` generally remains unchanged, unless it replaces a source color cell (`1`, `3`, or `4`).\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Identify all connected components of cells with the value `6` in the input grid, using 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).\n3.  Determine if the color `4` exists anywhere in the input grid. Store this information (e.g., `input_contains_4`).\n4.  Create a set to store the coordinates of \"used\" source cells (initially empty).\n5.  For each identified component of `6`s:\n    a.  Find all unique non-`6`, non-`7` colors that are present in cells directly adjacent (4-way) to any cell within this component. Let this set of unique adjacent source colors be `S`.\n    b.  If `S` contains exactly one color, `c`:\n        i.  Change the value of all cells belonging to this component to `c` in the output grid.\n        ii. Find the coordinates of the source cell(s) with color `c` that were adjacent to this component and add them to the \"used\" source cells set.\n    c.  If `S` is empty (the component is only adjacent to `7`s or other `6`s in the same component):\n        i.  If `input_contains_4` is true, change the value of all cells belonging to this component to `4` in the output grid.\n        ii. If `input_contains_4` is false, leave the cells in this component unchanged (they remain `6`) in the output grid.\n    d.  If `S` contains more than one unique color, leave the cells in this component unchanged (`6`) in the output grid.\n6.  Iterate through all cells in the input grid that contain a source color (`1`, `3`, or `4`):\n    a.  If the coordinates of this cell are in the \"used\" source cells set, change its value to `7` in the output grid.\n    b.  If the coordinates of this cell are *not* in the \"used\" source cells set, change its value to `7` in the output grid.\n7.  The final state of the output grid represents the result of the transformation."
