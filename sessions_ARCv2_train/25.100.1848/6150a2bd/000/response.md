Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to discern the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both structured as grids (or matrices) of numbers.
*   Each grid consists of rows and columns containing integer values.
*   The examples provided (`train_1` and `train_2`) show 3x3 grids.
*   The transformation appears to reposition the elements within the grid without changing their values.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array (matrix) of integers
    properties:
      - rows: 3
      - columns: 3
      - cells: contain integer values
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array (matrix) of integers
    properties:
      - rows: 3
      - columns: 3
      - cells: contain integer values derived from the input grid
actions:
  - action: reposition_elements
    description: The elements from the input grid are moved to new positions in the output grid.
relationships:
  - relationship: grid_rotation
    description: The output grid appears to be a 180-degree rotation of the input grid.
    evidence:
      - In train_1: The element at input[0][0] (value 5) moves to output[2][2]. The element at input[0][1] (value 5) moves to output[2][1]. The element at input[0][2] (value 2) moves to output[2][0]. The element at input[1][0] (value 1) moves to output[1][2], and so on. This pattern matches a 180-degree rotation (flip both horizontally and vertically).
      - In train_2: The same pattern holds. Input[0][0] (value 3) moves to output[2][2]. Input[0][2] (value 8) moves to output[2][0]. Input[2][0] (value 5) moves to output[0][2].

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input grid.
2.  Determine the dimensions of the input grid (number of rows `N` and number of columns `M`).
3.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions (`N` rows, `M` columns).
4.  For each element in the input grid at position `[row][col]`:
    *   Place this element into the output grid at position `[N - 1 - row][M - 1 - col]`.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
