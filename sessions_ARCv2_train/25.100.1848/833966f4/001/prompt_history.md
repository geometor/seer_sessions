```


**output:**
```

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves rearranging a sequence of single-digit numbers. The input is presented as a vertical list of numbers, and the output is also a vertical list of numbers. Comparing the input and output sequences reveals a specific pattern of element swapping. Both examples show a list of 5 numbers. The first two numbers are swapped, and the fourth and fifth numbers are swapped, while the middle number (at index 2) remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_list
    type: list
    properties:
      - elements: single-digit integers
      - length: 5 (based on examples)
  - name: output_list
    type: list
    properties:
      - elements: single-digit integers (derived from input)
      - length: 5 (same as input)

actions:
  - name: swap_elements
    parameters:
      - list: input_list
      - index1: integer
      - index2: integer
    effects:
      - modifies: list order

relationships:
  - type: positional_mapping
    description: |
      The element at input index 0 moves to output index 1.
      The element at input index 1 moves to output index 0.
      The element at input index 2 stays at output index 2.
      The element at input index 3 moves to output index 4.
      The element at input index 4 moves to output index 3.
  - type: transformation_rule
    applies_to: input_list
    results_in: output_list
    logic: |
      Swap the first pair of elements (indices 0 and 1).
      Keep the middle element (index 2) in place.
      Swap the last pair of elements (indices 3 and 4).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input list of five numbers.
2.  Swap the number at the first position (index 0) with the number at the second position (index 1).
3.  Leave the number at the third position (index 2) unchanged.
4.  Swap the number at the fourth position (index 3) with the number at the fifth position (index 4).
5.  Return the rearranged list as the output.
