*   **Perception:** The input is a 3x3 grid containing single-digit integers. The grid includes zeros and one specific non-zero digit repeated multiple times. The output is a sequence (list) containing all the non-zero digits found in the input grid. The order of elements in the output sequence appears consistent with scanning the input grid row by row, from left to right.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - input_grid:
          type: 2D array of integers
          properties:
            - size: 3x3 (in examples)
            - contains: cells
      - output_sequence:
          type: 1D array (list) of integers
          properties:
            - elements: derived from input_grid
      - cell:
          type: grid element
          properties:
            - value: integer (0 or a non-zero digit)
      - non_zero_number:
          type: integer
          properties:
            - value: > 0
    actions:
      - scan: Iterate through the input_grid.
      - filter: Select cells based on their value.
      - collect: Gather selected values into the output_sequence.
    relationships:
      - output_sequence contains all non_zero_number values present in the input_grid.
      - The order of elements in output_sequence corresponds to finding non_zero_number values during a row-by-row, left-to-right scan of the input_grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an empty list to store the output sequence.
    2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from top to bottom.
    3.  For each row, iterate through each cell (number), from left to right.
    4.  If the value of the current cell is not zero, append this value to the output sequence.
    5.  Return the final output sequence.
