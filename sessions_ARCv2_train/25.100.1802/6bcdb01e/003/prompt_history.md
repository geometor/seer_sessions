## Perception

1.  **Data Format:** The input and output are grids (2D arrays or matrices) containing single-digit integer values.
2.  **Grid Dimensions:** The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the dimensions of the input grid for each example.
3.  **Values:** The grids primarily contain the numbers 7 and 8. The number 3 also appears, both in the input and more extensively in the output.
4.  **Transformation Pattern:** Many grid cells retain their original value from input to output. The primary change involves the value 7 being replaced by the value 3 in certain locations. The value 8 appears unchanged between input and output.
5.  **Origin of Change:** The new 3s in the output seem to originate or spread from the locations where 3s were present in the input.
6.  **Spread Mechanism:** The value 3 appears to "flood fill" or propagate into adjacent (up, down, left, right) cells.
7.  **Propagation Rules:**
    *   The fill only replaces cells containing the value 7.
    *   The fill does not replace cells containing the value 8. 8s act as barriers.
    *   The fill does not extend beyond the grid boundaries.
    *   The propagation seems iterative: a 7 changed to a 3 can then cause its adjacent 7s to change to 3 in the next step, until no more 7s are adjacent to any 3s.

## Facts


```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      description: A 2D array of integer values.
      properties:
        - rows: Number of rows.
        - columns: Number of columns.
        - cells: Individual elements within the grid.
  - cell:
      description: An element within the grid at a specific position.
      properties:
        - row_index: The vertical position (0-based).
        - column_index: The horizontal position (0-based).
        - value: The integer contained in the cell (e.g., 3, 7, 8).
relationships:
  - adjacency: Cells sharing an edge (up, down, left, right) are adjacent.
  - boundary: The edges of the grid define its limits.
  - barrier: Cells with value 8 prevent the propagation of value 3.
properties:
  - fill_value: The value 3, which spreads.
  - target_value: The value 7, which can be replaced by the fill_value.
  - barrier_value: The value 8, which blocks the spread.
actions:
  - identify_initial_fill_cells: Find all cells in the input grid with the fill_value (3).
  - propagate_fill: Iteratively change adjacent target_value (7) cells to the fill_value (3), starting from the initial fill cells and continuing from newly filled cells.
  - respect_barriers: Do not change cells with the barrier_value (8).
  - respect_boundaries: Do not attempt to fill outside the grid limits.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a direct copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all cells in the input grid that contain the value 3. Maintain a list or set of coordinates for these "active" 3-cells.
3.  Start an iterative process:
    a.  Create an empty list for newly changed cells in the current iteration.
    b.  For each active 3-cell coordinate identified in the previous step (or the initial identification):
        i.  Examine its adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right).
        ii. For each neighbor within the grid boundaries:
            *   If the neighbor cell in the *output* grid currently contains the value 7:
                *   Change the value of this neighbor cell in the *output* grid to 3.
                *   Add the coordinates of this newly changed cell to the list for the current iteration.
    c.  Replace the list of active 3-cells with the list of newly changed cells from this iteration.
    d.  If no cells were changed in this iteration (the list of newly changed cells is empty), stop the process.
    e.  Otherwise, repeat from step 3a.
4.  The final state of the output grid is the result of the transformation.

Okay, the metrics confirm the visual inspection:
- The number of 8s remains constant from input to output (correct).
- The number of 3s increases significantly from input to output.
- The number of 7s decreases correspondingly.
- The `transformed` output (from the previous code) has far more 3s and far fewer 7s than the `expected` output, confirming the overfilling.
- The pixel difference counts (14 for Ex1, 6 for Ex2) match the report.

The revised hypothesis about directional propagation (down/horizontal, not up) seems plausible. Let's refine the facts and the natural language program based on this.

**Refined Hypothesis Check:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Initial 3s at `(5, 0)` and `(5, 1)`.
    *   Downward/Horizontal Spread from `(5, 0)`: Changes `(6, 0)`? No, `(6,0)` is 7 in input and output. Why? Ah, maybe propagation *only* occurs if the cell *below* the source 3 is a 7? Let's re-evaluate.
    *   Looking at `(5,1)` in input 1. It's a 3. Below it is `(6,1)` which is 7. In the output `(6,1)` is 7. This contradicts the "downward propagation" idea.
    *   Looking at `(3, 1)` in input 2. It's a 3. Below it is `(4, 1)`, also a 3. To its right is `(3, 2)` which is 7. In output `(3, 2)` is 7. This seems wrong.
    *   Let's look at `(3, 1)` in input 2 again. It's a 3. To its left is `(3, 0)` which is 7. Output `(3, 0)` is 3. Okay. To its right is `(3, 2)`=7. Output `(3, 2)`=7. Above is `(2, 1)`=7. Output `(2, 1)`=3. Okay. Below is `(4, 1)`=3. Okay.
    *   Now look at `(4, 1)` in input 2. It's a 3. To its left is `(4, 0)`=7. Output `(4, 0)`=7. To its right is `(4, 2)`=7. Output `(4, 2)`=7. Above is `(3, 1)`=3. Below is out of bounds.

This is confusing. The simple directional flood fill isn't quite right either.

**Let's rethink the propagation source.** What if only the *original* 3s in the input act as sources, and they 'paint' adjacent 7s, but these newly painted 3s *do not* propagate further?

*   **Hypothesis 3: Single-step propagation from original sources.**
    *   Identify all cells with 3 in the *input*.
    *   For each *original* 3, check its neighbors (up, down, left, right).
    *   If a neighbor is 7 in the *input*, change it to 3 in the *output*.
    *   All other cells retain their input value.

Let's test Hypothesis 3:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Original 3s: `(5, 0)`, `(5, 1)`
    *   Neighbors of `(5, 0)`: `(4, 0)`=7 -> 3, `(6, 0)`=7 -> 3, `(5, 1)`=3 (ignore).
    *   Neighbors of `(5, 1)`: `(4, 1)`=7 -> 3, `(6, 1)`=7 -> 3, `(5, 0)`=3 (ignore), `(5, 2)`=7 -> 3.
    *   Output grid (initially copy of input):
        *   `output[4][0] = 3`
        *   `output[6][0] = 3`
        *   `output[4][1] = 3`
        *   `output[6][1] = 3`
        *   `output[5][2] = 3`
    *   Resulting Grid:
        
```
        8 7 7 8 7 8 7
        7 8 8 7 7 7 8
        7 7 7 7 7 7 7
        7 7 7 7 7 7 8
        3 3 7 7 7 8 7  <- (4,0)=3, (4,1)=3
        3 3 3 7 8 7 7  <- (5,2)=3
        3 3 7 8 7 7 7  <- (6,0)=3, (6,1)=3
        ```

    *   This doesn't match the expected output either. There's still propagation happening beyond the immediate neighbors.

**Let's reconsider the first attempt (Flood Fill) and the specific differences.**

*   **Example 1 Diff:**
    *   `transformed[0][4]`=3, `expected[0][4]`=7. Why did the code fill upwards to `(0,4)`? The path seems to be `(5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1)` (blocked by 8) but also `(5,0) -> (4,0) -> (3,0) -> (2,0) -> (1,0)`=7 (change to 3) -> `(0,0)`=8 (block) AND `(1,0)` -> `(1,1)`=8 (block) ... Wait, the path seems complex.
    *   Let's trace the expected output's 3s back to the source 3s `(5,0)` and `(5,1)` ensuring we only cross 7s or other 3s, and are blocked by 8s.
    *   Expected `(3,0)` is 3. Path: `(5,0) -> (4,0)` (is 7 in input) -> `(3,0)` (is 7 in input). Valid path.
    *   Expected `(1,3)` is 3. Path: `(5,1) -> (5,2)` (is 7) -> `(5,3)` (is 7) -> `(4,3)` (is 7) -> `(3,3)` (is 7) -> `(2,3)` (is 7) -> `(1,3)` (is 7). Valid path.
    *   Expected `(1,4)` is 3. Path: `(1,3)` (now 3) -> `(1,4)` (is 7). Valid path.
    *   Expected `(1,5)` is 3. Path: `(1,4)` (now 3) -> `(1,5)` (is 7). Valid path.
    *   Expected `(2,5)` is 3. Path: `(1,5)` (now 3) -> `(2,5)` (is 7). Valid path.
    *   Expected `(3,5)` is 3. Path: `(2,5)` (now 3) -> `(3,5)` (is 7). Valid path.
    *   Expected `(3,6)` is 8. Blocked. Correct.
    *   Expected `(4,6)` is 7. It's adjacent to `(3,6)`=8 and `(5,6)`=7. Is `(5,6)` connected to a 3? `(5,6)` -> `(5,5)`=8. Blocked. So `(4,6)` should remain 7. Correct.
    *   Expected `(0,1)` is 7. Neighbors are `(0,0)`=8, `(0,2)`=7, `(1,1)`=8. `(0,2)` neighbours are `(0,1)`=7, `(0,3)`=8, `(1,2)`=8. It seems `(0,1)` and `(0,2)` are isolated from the 3s by 8s. They should remain 7. Correct.
    *   Expected `(0,4)` is 7. Neighbors `(0,3)`=8, `(0,5)`=8, `(1,4)`=3. Why didn't `(1,4)` (which is 3) change `(0,4)`?

*   **Hypothesis 4: Gravity.** Maybe the 3s only spread if they have "support" below them? Or maybe 7s only change if they are adjacent to a 3 *and* there is a path of 7s or 3s downwards from the 7 to the bottom edge or another 3? No, that seems overly complex.

*   **Revisit Directional Propagation (Hypothesis 2):**
    *   What if the initial code's BFS implementation was subtly wrong for this task?
    *   The code uses a single queue and adds any changed 7 to the queue. This standard BFS explores in all directions equally.
    *   Let's reconsider the idea: "3 propagates downwards and horizontally, but not upwards".
    *   How to implement this? When exploring neighbors of cell `(r, c)`, only consider `(r+1, c)` (down), `(r, c-1)` (left), and `(r, c+1)` (right). Do *not* consider `(r-1, c)` (up).

Let's test this refined Hypothesis 2 (Down/Horizontal BFS):

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Queue starts with `(5, 0), (5, 1)`.
    *   Process `(5, 0)`: Neighbors (down, left, right): `(6, 0)`=7 -> change to 3, add `(6, 0)` to queue. `(5, -1)` (out). `(5, 1)`=3 (ignore).
    *   Process `(5, 1)`: Neighbors: `(6, 1)`=7 -> change to 3, add `(6, 1)`. `(5, 0)`=3 (ignore). `(5, 2)`=7 -> change to 3, add `(5, 2)`.
    *   Process `(6, 0)`: Neighbors: `(7, 0)` (out). `(6, -1)` (out). `(6, 1)`=3 (now 3).
    *   Process `(6, 1)`: Neighbors: `(7, 1)` (out). `(6, 0)`=3 (now 3). `(6, 2)`=7 -> change to 3, add `(6, 2)`.
    *   Process `(5, 2)`: Neighbors: `(6, 2)`=3 (now 3). `(5, 1)`=3. `(5, 3)`=7 -> change to 3, add `(5, 3)`.
    *   Process `(6, 2)`: Neighbors: `(7, 2)` (out). `(6, 1)`=3. `(6, 3)`=8 (block).
    *   Process `(5, 3)`: Neighbors: `(6, 3)`=8 (block). `(5, 2)`=3. `(5, 4)`=8 (block).
    *   Queue is empty.
    *   Resulting Grid (Changes marked):
        
```
        8 7 7 8 7 8 7
        7 8 8 7 7 7 8
        7 7 7 7 7 7 7
        7 7 7 7 7 7 8
        7 7 7 7 7 8 7
        3 3 3* 7 8 7 7  <- (5,2)=3
        3* 3* 3* 8 7 7 7  <- (6,0)=3, (6,1)=3, (6,2)=3
        ```

    *   Still doesn't match. It changes *fewer* cells than expected.

**What if the propagation rule depends on the *relative position* to the *original* source 3s?**

*   **Hypothesis 5: Gravity/Support relative to Original Sources.** A cell `(r, c)` containing 7 changes to 3 if and only if:
    1.  It is adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a cell `(nr, nc)` which is either an *original* 3 from the input grid OR has already been changed to 3 by this rule.
    2.  The cell `(r, c)` is NOT blocked by an 8.
    3.  There exists at least one *original* source 3 at `(sr, sc)` such that `r >= sr` (the cell is at the same row or lower than the source).

Let's test Hypothesis 5:

*   **Implementation Idea:** Perform a standard flood fill (like the original code), but *after* the fill is complete, iterate through the output grid. Any cell `(r, c)` that is now 3, check if there exists *any* original 3 at `(sr, sc)` in the *input* grid where `r >= sr`. If no such original 3 exists, revert the cell `(r, c)` back to 7.

Let's apply this logic to the `transformed` output from the initial code (which performed a full flood fill).

*   **Example 1:** Original 3s are in row 5 (`(5,0)`, `(5,1)`).
    *   `transformed1` has 3s in rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
    *   Check cells changed to 3 in rows 1, 2, 3, 4. The rule `r >= sr` requires `r >= 5`. Since `1 < 5`, `2 < 5`, `3 < 5`, `4 < 5`, all 3s in these rows should be reverted to 7.
    *   Rows 5 and 6 have `r >= 5`, so 3s in these rows remain 3 (if they were changed from 7 during the flood fill or were originally 3).
    *   Let's apply this reversion to `transformed1`:
        
```
        [8, 7, 7, 8, 7*, 8, 7]  # 3 reverted to 7 (row 0 < 5)
        [7*, 8, 8, 7*, 7*, 7*, 8]  # 3s reverted to 7 (row 1 < 5)
        [7*, 7*, 7*, 7*, 7*, 7*, 7*] # 3s reverted to 7 (row 2 < 5)
        [7*, 7*, 7*, 7*, 7*, 7*, 8]  # 3s reverted to 7 (row 3 < 5)
        [7*, 7*, 7*, 7*, 7*, 8, 7]  # 3s reverted to 7 (row 4 < 5)
        [3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 7, 7]  # 3s remain (row 5 >= 5)
        [3, 3, 3, 8, 7, 7, 7]  # 3s remain (row 6 >= 5)
        ```

    *   This STILL doesn't match `expected1`. `expected1` has 3s in rows 1, 3, 4, 5. Hypothesis 5 is wrong.

**Let's simplify. Look only at Example 2.**

*   Input:
    
```
    7 8 7 8 7
    8 7 7 7 8
    7 7 7 7 7
    7 3 7 7 8  <- Original 3 at (3, 1)
    7 3 7 8 7  <- Original 3 at (4, 1)
    ```

*   Expected Output:
    
```
    7 8 7 8 7
    8 3 3 3 8  <- Row 1 changes
    7 3 7 3 7  <- Row 2 changes
    3 3 3 3 8  <- Row 3 changes
    7 3 7 8 7  <- Row 4 no changes (except original 3)
    ```

*   The cells changed are `(1,1)`, `(1,2)`, `(1,3)`, `(2,1)`, `(2,3)`, `(3,0)`, `(3,2)`, `(3,3)`.
*   Original 3s are at `(3,1)` and `(4,1)`.
*   Notice that changes happen *above* the original 3s. `(1,1)`, `(1,2)`, `(1,3)`, `(2,1)`, `(2,3)` are all in rows above row 3. This invalidates Hypothesis 5 (gravity constraint `r >= sr`).

**Back to Basics - Flood Fill with a Twist?**

Maybe the flood fill starts *only* from the original 3s, but the propagation rule is different? What if a 7 only changes if it's adjacent to a 3 *and* that 3 is "stable"? What makes a 3 stable?

Consider the concept of "connected components" of 7s. The 8s divide the grid into regions of 7s (and potentially 3s). The initial 3s exist within or adjacent to some of these regions.

*   **Hypothesis 6: Region-based Fill.**
    1.  Identify connected components of cells containing 7 or 3 in the input grid, where connectivity is defined by adjacency (up, down, left, right) and movement is blocked by 8s.
    2.  For each such component:
        *   Check if the component contains at least one *original* 3 from the input grid.
        *   If it does, change *all* 7s within that component to 3s in the output grid.
        *   If it does not contain an original 3, all 7s within that component remain 7s in the output grid.
    3.  Cells that were originally 8 remain 8. Cells that were originally 3 remain 3.

Let's test Hypothesis 6:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Original 3s: `(5, 0), (5, 1)`.
    *   Component 1: Contains `(5,0), (5,1)` and all reachable 7s. Let's trace:
        *   From `(5,0)`: `(4,0), (6,0)`
        *   From `(5,1)`: `(4,1), (6,1), (5,2)`
        *   From `(4,0)`: `(3,0)`
        *   From `(6,0)`: `(6,1)` (already visited)
        *   From `(4,1)`: `(3,1)`
        *   From `(6,1)`: `(6,0), (6,2)`
        *   From `(5,2)`: `(4,2), (6,2), (5,3)`
        *   ... keep going, avoiding 8s ...
        *   This component seems to include: `(5,0), (5,1), (4,0), (6,0), (4,1), (6,1), (5,2), (3,0), (3,1), (6,2), (4,2), (5,3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,3), (1,1)`=8(stop), `(1,2)`=8(stop), `(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,4)`=7, `(3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)`. Also `(5,4)`=8(stop), `(6,3)`=8(stop), `(5,6)`=7, `(4,6)`=7, `(3,6)`=7, `(2,6)`=7, `(1,6)`=8(stop). Also `(6,4), (6,5), (6,6)`. Seems complex to trace manually. Let's use the `expected1` output to guide. All the cells that are 3 in `expected1` *should* belong to the component containing the original 3s. All cells that are 7 in `expected1` should belong to components *not* containing original 3s (or be isolated 7s).
        *   `expected1` 3s: `(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)`. Are these all connected via 7s/3s in the input, avoiding 8s? Yes, seems plausible. Let's check a 7 in the output: `(0,1)`=7. Neighbors: `(0,0)`=8, `(1,1)`=8, `(0,2)`=7. Path from `(0,1)` or `(0,2)` cannot reach `(5,0)` or `(5,1)` without crossing an 8. So this component {`(0,1), (0,2)`} does not contain an original 3. They remain 7. Looks consistent. Check `(0,4)`=7. Neighbors: `(0,3)`=8, `(0,5)`=8, `(1,4)`=3(in output). `(1,4)` is 7 in input. Does `(1,4)` connect to `(5,0)/(5,1)`? Yes, path: `(1,4)->(2,4)->(3,4)->(3,3)->(3,2)->(3,1)->(4,1)->(5,1)`. Okay, so `(1,4)` is in the component. Therefore, if Hypothesis 6 is right, `(1,4)` should become 3. It does in `expected1`. Now, why does `(0,4)` remain 7? Because it cannot reach the component containing the original 3s. Path `(0,4)->(1,4)` is blocked by rule definition (only connect via 7s or *original* 3s?). Let's refine:
    *   **Hypothesis 6 (Refined):**
        1.  Identify connected components of cells containing only the value 7 in the *input* grid. Connectivity is up, down, left, right. 8s are barriers.
        2.  For each component of 7s:
            *   Check if any cell in the component is adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a cell containing an *original* 3 in the *input* grid.
            *   If yes, change *all* 7s in this component to 3s in the output grid.
            *   If no, all 7s in this component remain 7s.
        3.  Original 3s remain 3. Original 8s remain 8.

*   **Test Hypothesis 6 (Refined) on Example 1:**
    *   Original 3s: `(5,0), (5,1)`.
    *   Component A: {`(0,1), (0,2)`}. Neighbors include `(0,0)`=8, `(1,1)`=8, `(1,2)`=8, `(0,3)`=8. No cell in this component is adjacent to an original 3. -> Remains 7. Correct.
    *   Component B: {`(0,4), (0,6)`}. Neighbors include `(0,3)`=8, `(0,5)`=8, `(1,4)`=7, `(1,6)`=8. Cell `(1,4)` is part of Component C (see below). `(0,4)` is not adjacent to an original 3. `(0,6)` is not adjacent to an original 3. -> This component remains 7. Correct.
    *   Component C: The large central region of 7s. Includes `(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,0)...(2,6), (3,0)...(3,6), (4,0)...(4,4), (4,6), (5,2), (5,3), (5,6), (6,0)...(6,2), (6,4)...(6,6)`.
        *   Is any cell here adjacent to `(5,0)` or `(5,1)`?
        *   Yes, `(4,0)` is adjacent to `(5,0)`.
        *   Yes, `(6,0)` is adjacent to `(5,0)`.
        *   Yes, `(4,1)` is adjacent to `(5,1)`.
        *   Yes, `(6,1)` is adjacent to `(5,1)`.
        *   Yes, `(5,2)` is adjacent to `(5,1)`.
        *   Since this component is adjacent to original 3s, *all* 7s in it should change to 3.
    *   Let's construct the output based on this:
        *   Component A remains 7.
        *   Component B remains 7.
        *   Component C changes to 3.
        *   Original 3s remain 3.
        *   Original 8s remain 8.
        
```
        8 7 7 8 7 8 7  <- Component A & B remain 7
        7 8 8 3 3 3 8  <- Component C changes to 3
        3 3 3 3 3 3 3  <- Component C changes to 3
        3 3 3 3 3 3 8  <- Component C changes to 3
        3 3 3 3 3 8 7  <- Component C changes to 3, except (4,6) which is Component C
        3 3 3 3 8 7 7  <- Original 3s, (5,2),(5,3) are Comp C -> 3. (5,6) is Comp C -> 3. (5,4)=8.
        3 3 3 8 3 3 3  <- Component C changes to 3
        ```

        Okay, tracing the component manually is error-prone. Let's re-examine `expected1`:
        
```
        8 7 7 8 7 8 7
        7 8 8 3 3 3 8
        7 7 7 3 7 3 7  <- Note (2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(2,4),(2,6) are 7!
        3 3 3 3 3 3 8  <- Note (3,0),(3,1),(3,2) are 3!
        7 7 7 3 7 8 7
        3 3 3 3 8 7 7
        7 7 7 8 7 7 7
        ```

        Hypothesis 6 (Refined) predicted *all* of component C would become 3, but the expected output shows many 7s remaining *within* what seemed like that component (e.g., `(2,0), (2,1), (2,2)`). This invalidates Hypothesis 6.

**Final attempt: Back to Flood Fill (Hypothesis 1), but maybe the definition of "adjacent" or "barrier" is different?**

*   What if 8s are not absolute barriers, but just slow things down? No, they seem absolute.
*   What if connectivity is diagonal? No, examples usually stick to ortho.
*   What if the *number* of adjacent 3s matters? No clear pattern.

Let's trust the original code's structure (BFS flood fill from original 3s) but reconsider the condition for changing a 7 to a 3.

Look at the `expected1` output vs the `transformed1` (overfilled) output.
Where did `transformed1` put a 3, but `expected1` kept a 7?
- `(0,4)`: T=3, E=7. Neighbors in E: (0,3)=8, (0,5)=8, (1,4)=3.
- `(1,0)`: T=3, E=7. Neighbors in E: (0,0)=8, (2,0)=7, (1,1)=8.
- `(2,0)`: T=3, E=7. Neighbors in E: (1,0)=7, (3,0)=3, (2,1)=7.
- `(2,1)`: T=3, E=7. Neighbors in E: (1,1)=8, (3,1)=3, (2,0)=7, (2,2)=7.
- `(2,2)`: T=3, E=7. Neighbors in E: (1,2)=8, (3,2)=3, (2,1)=7, (2,3)=3.
- `(2,4)`: T=3, E=7. Neighbors in E: (1,4)=3, (3,4)=3, (2,3)=3, (2,5)=3.
- `(2,6)`: T=3, E=7. Neighbors in E: (1,6)=8, (3,6)=8, (2,5)=3.
- `(4,0)`: T=3, E=7. Neighbors in E: (3,0)=3, (5,0)=3, (4,1)=7.
- `(4,1)`: T=3, E=7. Neighbors in E: (3,1)=3, (5,1)=3, (4,0)=7, (4,2)=7.
- `(4,2)`: T=3, E=7. Neighbors in E: (3,2)=3, (5,2)=3, (4,1)=7, (4,3)=3.
- `(4,4)`: T=3, E=7. Neighbors in E: (3,4)=3, (5,4)=8, (4,3)=3, (4,5)=8.
- `(4,6)`: T=3, E=7. Neighbors in E: (3,6)=8, (5,6)=7, (4,5)=8.
- `(6,0)`: T=3, E=7. Neighbors in E: (5,0)=3, (6,1)=7.
- `(6,1)`: T=3, E=7. Neighbors in E: (5,1)=3, (6,0)=7, (6,2)=7.
- `(6,2)`: T=3, E=7. Neighbors in E: (5,2)=3, (6,1)=7, (6,3)=8.

It seems the standard flood fill (BFS) used in the initial code correctly identifies *all* cells that *can* be reached by a '3' signal propagating through '7's from the original '3's, without crossing '8's. However, the task doesn't change *all* reachable '7's. It changes only a subset.

Which subset? Let's revisit Example 2.
Input:

```
7 8 7 8 7
8 7 7 7 8
7 7 7 7 7
7 3 7 7 8  (3,1)
7 3 7 8 7  (4,1)
```

Output:

```
7 8 7 8 7
8 3 3 3 8
7 3 7 3 7
3 3 3 3 8
7 3 7 8 7
```

Consider the cell `(2,2)`=7. In the output, it's 7. Neighbors in output: `(1,2)`=3, `(3,2)`=3, `(2,1)`=3, `(2,3)`=3. It's completely surrounded by 3s (or original 7s that became 3s), yet it remains 7. This strongly contradicts any simple flood fill or connectivity rule.

What if the rule is about the *shape* or pattern? The number 3 looks like it might be filling areas that are somewhat "contained" or "below" the source?

Consider the original 3s as sources of something "falling".
Maybe a 7 changes to 3 if it's adjacent to a 3 (original or changed## General Assessment

The previous code implemented a standard flood fill algorithm where the value 3 replaced adjacent 7s, blocked by 8s. The execution results show this approach is partially correct but results in **overfilling** – too many 7s are changed to 3s compared to the expected output.

Specifically, the code transformed 14 more pixels than expected in Example 1 and 6 more pixels in Example 2. Examining the differences between the transformed and expected outputs reveals that the 3s propagated upwards and sometimes further horizontally than they should have.

The strategy is to refine the propagation rule. The initial hypothesis assumed omnidirectional spread (up, down, left, right). The new evidence suggests a directional constraint. The most likely constraint is that the fill primarily propagates **downwards** and **horizontally** from the source 3s or newly filled 3s, but **not upwards**.
