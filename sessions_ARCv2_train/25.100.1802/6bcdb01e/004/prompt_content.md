"""
Applies a directional flood fill transformation to a 2D grid.
The transformation starts from cells with the value 3 (fill_value).
The fill propagates only downwards and horizontally (left/right) into 
adjacent cells containing the value 7 (target_value).
Propagation is blocked by cells containing the value 8 (barrier_value) 
and the grid boundaries.
The fill does not propagate upwards.
Newly filled cells (7s changed to 3s) can also propagate the fill 
downwards and horizontally in subsequent steps.
