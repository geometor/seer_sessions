objects:
  - grid:
      description: A 2D array of integer values.
      properties:
        - rows: Number of rows.
        - columns: Number of columns.
        - cells: Individual elements within the grid.
  - cell:
      description: An element within the grid at a specific position (row, column).
      properties:
        - row_index: The vertical position (0-based).
        - column_index: The horizontal position (0-based).
        - value: The integer contained in the cell (e.g., 3, 7, 8).
relationships:
  - adjacency: Cells sharing an edge (up, down, left, right) are adjacent.
  - boundary: The edges of the grid define its limits.
  - barrier: Cells with value 8 prevent the propagation/transformation of adjacent cells.
  - connectivity: The ability to trace a path between cells via adjacent cells meeting specific value criteria (e.g., path of 7s).
properties:
  - fill_value: The value 3.
  - target_value: The value 7.
  - barrier_value: The value 8.
  - source_cells: The set of cells containing the fill_value (3) in the input grid.
actions:
  - identify_source_cells: Find all cells in the input grid with the fill_value (3).
  - identify_reachable_target_cells: Find all cells initially containing the target_value (7) that are connected to at least one source_cell via a path of adjacent cells, where the path cells contain only the target_value (7) or fill_value (3) in the input grid, and the path does not cross a barrier_value (8). This is effectively what an omnidirectional flood fill finds.
  - apply_unknown_constraint: Filter the set of reachable_target_cells based on an as-yet unidentified condition. Some reachable target cells are *not* changed to the fill_value in the final output.
  - generate_output: Create the output grid by copying the input grid, then changing only the subset of reachable_target_cells that satisfy the unknown constraint from target_value (7) to fill_value (3).
