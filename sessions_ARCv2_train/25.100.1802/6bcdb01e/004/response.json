            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous attempt used a directional flood fill (down, left, right), which proved less accurate than the initial omnidirectional flood fill. The directional fill failed to change several '7' cells that *should* have been changed according to the expected output (primarily cells above the initial '3's). The omnidirectional fill (from the first analysis stage) changed too many '7' cells.\n\nThis indicates that the transformation *is* a form of flood fill originating from the '3' cells and propagating through '7' cells, blocked by '8's. However, there's an additional constraint: not all reachable '7' cells are ultimately changed to '3'.\n\nComparing the results of the first omnidirectional fill attempt (`transformed1` / `transformed2` generated during the thought process for the previous response) with the `expected` outputs reveals the specific cells that were incorrectly changed by the simple flood fill. There must be a condition that prevents these specific cells from changing or reverts them after an initial fill. Attempts to define this condition based on \"stability,\" \"drainage,\" \"downward connectivity,\" or \"dual connectivity\" failed to consistently explain the examples (particularly cell `(2,2)` in Example 2 remaining 7 despite being reachable and surrounded by cells that become 3).\n\nGiven the difficulty in identifying the precise constraint, the strategy is to revert to the omnidirectional flood fill as the core mechanism, as it correctly identifies the *superset* of cells that *could* change. The challenge remains to define the exact rule for which cells within this superset actually make the final change.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's analyze the differences, focusing on the *first* (omnidirectional) code attempt's output compared to the expected output, as this highlights the cells that should *not* have been filled.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\n*   Input Grid (7x7)\n*   Expected Output Grid (7x7)\n*   Omni-Fill Output Grid (7x7) - Generated by `code_00.py` from the previous round's *first* execution.\n*   **Cells where Input=7, Expected=7, Omni-Fill=3 (Incorrectly Filled):**\n    *   (0,4)\n    *   (1,0)\n    *   (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,4), (2,6)\n    *   (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,4), (4,6)\n    *   (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n    *   Total: 16 cells.
