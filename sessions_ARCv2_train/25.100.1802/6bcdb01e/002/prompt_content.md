"""
Flood fill transformation:
1. Copy the input grid to create the output grid.
2. Identify all cells initially containing the value 3 (fill_value).
3. Use a queue-based iterative process (like Breadth-First Search) to propagate the fill_value (3).
4. In each step, check the neighbors (up, down, left, right) of the cells currently containing the fill_value.
5. If a neighbor cell contains the target_value (7) and is within the grid boundaries, change its value to the fill_value (3) and add it to the queue for further propagation in the next iteration.
6. Cells with the barrier_value (8) block the propagation; they are neither changed nor allow propagation through them.
7. Continue the process until the queue is empty, meaning no more target_value cells are adjacent to fill_value cells.
