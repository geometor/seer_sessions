Identify all 'target' cells (value 7) that are reachable from any source cell.\n3. Reachability means a path exists between a source cell and a target cell consisting only of adjacent (up, down, left, right) cells that are either sources (3) or targets (7) in the input grid. Cells with value 8 act as barriers and block paths.\n4. Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n5. Change the value of all identified reachable target cells from 7 to 3 in the output grid.\n\nNOTE: This implementation reflects the analysis that a standard flood fill correctly identifies a superset of cells to change. However, comparison with examples shows that an additional, currently unknown, constraint prevents *some* of these reachable 7s from actually changing. This code implements the flood fill but lacks the unknown filtering step, and will thus produce the same over-filled result as the initial omni-directional attempt analyzed previously.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_reachable_target_cells(grid: list[list[int]], source_value: int, target_value: int, barrier_value: int) -> set[tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all cells with target_value reachable from cells with source_value,\n    moving only through target_value or source_value cells and avoiding barrier_value cells.\n    Uses Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input 2D list of integers.\n        source_value: The value of source cells (e.g., 3).\n        target_value: The value of target cells (e.g., 7).\n        barrier_value: The value of barrier cells (e.g., 8).\n\n    Returns:\n        A set of (row, col) tuples representing the coordinates of reachable target cells.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not grid or not grid[0]:\n        return set()\n\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    \n    queue = deque()\n    # Keep track of visited cells (r, c) to avoid cycles and redundant work\n    # Includes sources, barriers, and visited targets.\n    visited = set() \n    # Store coordinates of reachable target cells\n    reachable_targets = set() \n\n    # Initialize the queue with source cells and mark barriers as visited\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == source_value:\n                # Start BFS from source cells\n                if (r, c) not in visited:\n                    queue.append((r, c))\n                    visited.add((r, c))\n            elif grid[r][c] == barrier_value:\n                # Barriers cannot be entered or traversed\n                 visited.add((r, c))\n\n    # Define neighbor directions (up, down, left, right)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n    # Perform BFS to find all reachable target cells\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n\n            # Check if the neighbor is within grid boundaries\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                # Check if the neighbor has not been visited yet\n                if (nr, nc) not in visited:\n                    neighbor_value = grid[nr][nc]\n                    # Check if the neighbor is a target cell (7)\n                    if neighbor_value == target_value:\n                        # Mark as visited\n                        visited.add((nr, nc))\n                        # Add to queue for further exploration\n                        queue.append((nr, nc))\n                        # Record it as a reachable target cell\n                        reachable_targets.add((nr, nc))\n                    # Note: If a neighbor is a source cell (3), it would have been\n                    # added to visited during initialization or earlier in BFS.\n                    # If it's a barrier (8), it was added to visited initially.\n                    # Other values are ignored as they block traversal unless visited.\n                    \n    return reachable_targets\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a flood fill transformation based on reachability from '3' cells\n    through '7' cells, blocked by '8' cells.\n\n    Note: This implementation identifies all reachable '7's but lacks the\n    unknown filtering step observed in the examples.
