"""
Transformation Rule (Inferred):
1. Identify all 'source' cells (value 3) in the input grid.
2. Identify all 'target' cells (value 7) that are reachable from any source cell.
3. Reachability means a path exists between a source cell and a target cell consisting only of adjacent (up, down, left, right) cells that are either sources (3) or targets (7) in the input grid. Cells with value 8 act as barriers and block paths.
4. Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
5. Change the value of all identified reachable target cells from 7 to 3 in the output grid.

NOTE: This implementation reflects the analysis that a standard flood fill correctly identifies a superset of cells to change. However, comparison with examples shows that an additional, currently unknown, constraint prevents *some* of these reachable 7s from actually changing. This code implements the flood fill but lacks the unknown filtering step, and will thus produce the same over-filled result as the initial omni-directional attempt analyzed previously.
