Identify all cells initially containing the value 3 (fill_value).\n3. Use a queue-based iterative process (like Breadth-First Search) to propagate the fill_value (3).\n4. In each step, check the neighbors (up, down, left, right) of the cells currently containing the fill_value.\n5. If a neighbor cell contains the target_value (7) and is within the grid boundaries, change its value to the fill_value (3) and add it to the queue for further propagation in the next iteration.\n6. Cells with the barrier_value (8) block the propagation; they are neither changed nor allow propagation through them.\n7. Continue the process until the queue is empty, meaning no more target_value cells are adjacent to fill_value cells.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a flood fill transformation where the value 3 propagates\n    into adjacent cells containing 7, stopping at cells containing 8\n    or the grid boundaries.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A 2D list of integers representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A 2D list of integers representing the transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not input_grid or not input_grid[0]:\n        return []\n\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n\n    # Initialize output_grid as a deep copy of the input grid\n    output_grid = copy.deepcopy(input_grid)\n\n    # Define the values\n    fill_value = 3\n    target_value = 7\n    barrier_value = 8\n\n    # Initialize a queue for BFS (Breadth-First Search) propagation\n    # Store coordinates (row, col) of cells to process\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Find initial fill cells (value 3) and add them to the queue\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if output_grid[r][c] == fill_value:\n                # Add initial 3s to the queue to start propagation\n                queue.append((r, c))\n                # No need to mark initial 3s as processed, they won't be changed\n\n    # Define neighbor directions (up, down, left, right)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n    # Perform the flood fill using BFS\n    processed_target_cells = set() # Keep track of 7s added to queue to avoid cycles\n\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n\n            # Check if the neighbor is within grid boundaries\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                # Check if the neighbor is a target cell (value 7)\n                # and hasn't been added to the queue yet\n                if output_grid[nr][nc] == target_value and (nr, nc) not in processed_target_cells:\n                    # Change the target cell to the fill value\n                    output_grid[nr][nc] = fill_value\n                    # Add the newly filled cell to the queue for further propagation\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n                    # Mark this cell as processed\n                    processed_target_cells.add((nr, nc))\n                # Note: barrier_value (8) cells implicitly stop propagation\n                # as they don't match target_value.\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
