The number 3 also appears, both in the input and more extensively in the output.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** Many grid cells retain their original value from input to output. The primary change involves the value 7 being replaced by the value 3 in certain locations. The value 8 appears unchanged between input and output.\n5.  **Origin of Change:** The new 3s in the output seem to originate or spread from the locations where 3s were present in the input.\n6.  **Spread Mechanism:** The value 3 appears to \"flood fill\" or propagate into adjacent (up, down, left, right) cells.\n7.  **Propagation Rules:**\n    *   The fill only replaces cells containing the value 7.\n    *   The fill does not replace cells containing the value 8. 8s act as barriers.\n    *   The fill does not extend beyond the grid boundaries.\n    *   The propagation seems iterative: a 7 changed to a 3 can then cause its adjacent 7s to change to 3 in the next step, until no more 7s are adjacent to any 3s.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
