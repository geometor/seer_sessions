objects:
  - grid:
      description: A 2D array of integer values.
      properties:
        - rows: Number of rows.
        - columns: Number of columns.
        - cells: Individual elements within the grid.
  - cell:
      description: An element within the grid at a specific position.
      properties:
        - row_index: The vertical position (0-based).
        - column_index: The horizontal position (0-based).
        - value: The integer contained in the cell (e.g., 3, 7, 8).
relationships:
  - adjacency: Cells sharing an edge (up, down, left, right) are adjacent.
  - boundary: The edges of the grid define its limits.
  - barrier: Cells with value 8 prevent the propagation of value 3.
properties:
  - fill_value: The value 3, which spreads.
  - target_value: The value 7, which can be replaced by the fill_value.
  - barrier_value: The value 8, which blocks the spread.
actions:
  - identify_initial_fill_cells: Find all cells in the input grid with the fill_value (3).
  - propagate_fill: Iteratively change adjacent target_value (7) cells to the fill_value (3), starting from the initial fill cells and continuing from newly filled cells.
  - respect_barriers: Do not change cells with the barrier_value (8).
  - respect_boundaries: Do not attempt to fill outside the grid limits.
