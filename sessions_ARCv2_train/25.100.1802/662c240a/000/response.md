*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input data consists of 9 lines, each containing three space-separated integers.
    *   The input can be conceptually divided into three contiguous blocks of 3 lines each (Lines 1-3, 4-6, 7-9).
    *   The output data consists of exactly one of these 3-line blocks.
    *   Each 3-line block in the input appears to be constructed using only two distinct integer values among the nine integers present in that block.
    *   The core task is to identify which of the three input blocks should be selected as the output.
    *   The selection logic seems based on the frequency distribution of the two unique integers within each block. Specifically, the target block has one integer appearing 5 times and the other 4 times.
    *   A tie-breaking rule is necessary when multiple blocks satisfy this frequency condition. The tie-breaker appears to involve the sum of the two unique integers characterising the block.

    Actions:
      - Parse: Convert input text lines into lists of integers.
      - Group: Divide the 9 input Lines into 3 Blocks.
      - Analyze Block:
          - Identify the 2 UniqueIntegers within a Block's 9 integers.
          - Calculate the FrequencyCounts for these UniqueIntegers.
          - Determine if FrequencyCounts match the target pattern {5, 4}.
          - Calculate the UniqueIntegerSum for the block.
      - Filter: Identify all Blocks where IsTargetFrequency is true.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Divide the 9 input lines into three blocks: Block 1 (lines 1-3), Block 2 (lines 4-6), and Block 3 (lines 7-9).
    2.  For each block, determine the two unique integer values present across its three lines (total 9 integers).
    3.  For each block, count the occurrences of each of its two unique integers.
    4.  Identify all blocks where one unique integer appears exactly 5 times and the other unique integer appears exactly 4 times.
    5.  If exactly one block satisfies condition (4), select that block.
    6.  If multiple blocks satisfy condition (4), calculate the sum of the two unique integers for each of these blocks. Select the block for which this sum is the largest.
    7.  Output the three lines corresponding to the selected block.
