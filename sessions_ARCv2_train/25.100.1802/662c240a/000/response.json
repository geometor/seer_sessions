Specifically, the target block has one integer appearing 5 times and the other 4 times.\n    *   A tie-breaking rule is necessary when multiple blocks satisfy this frequency condition. The tie-breaker appears to involve the sum of the two unique integers characterising the block.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
