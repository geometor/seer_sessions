"""
The transformation rule selects one of three contiguous 3x3 blocks from a 9x3 input grid. 
The selection criteria are based on the frequency distribution of the two unique integer values within each block.

1.  Divide the 9x3 input grid into three 3x3 blocks (rows 1-3, 4-6, 7-9).
2.  For each 3x3 block:
    a.  Identify the two unique integer values present among its 9 integers.
    b.  Count the occurrences of each unique integer.
    c.  Determine if one integer appears exactly 5 times and the other appears exactly 4 times. Mark this block as a "candidate" if it meets this frequency condition.
    d.  Calculate the sum of the two unique integers for the block.
3.  Identify all candidate blocks from step 2c.
4.  If there is only one candidate block, select it as the output.
5.  If there are multiple candidate blocks, select the candidate block where the sum of its two unique integers (calculated in step 2d) is the largest.
6.  Return the selected 3x3 block.
