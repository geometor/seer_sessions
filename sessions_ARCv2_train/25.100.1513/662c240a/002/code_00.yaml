Grid:
  - Type: Input
    Properties:
      - Dimensions: Variable (e.g., 16x16)
      - Background_Color: Black (0)
      - Objects: Represented by contiguous groups of non-background pixels.
        Properties:
          - Color: Integer value > 0
          - Size: Pixel count
          - Contiguous: True (by definition of an object/component)
  - Type: Output
    Properties:
      - Dimensions: Same as input
      - Background_Color: Black (0)
      - Objects: A subset of the input objects.
Transformation:
  Action: Color-based Filtering
  Rule_Steps:
    - Step 1: Identify Target Color
      - Method: Calculate the total number of pixels for each non-background color present in the input grid.
      - Selection: The target color is the one with the highest total pixel count. (Handle ties if necessary - though not observed yet, typically keep all tied colors or apply a secondary rule like lowest color index). Assuming no ties for now or keep all tied.
    - Step 2: Filter Objects
      - Method: Create an output grid of the same size, filled with the background color.
      - Selection: Copy only the pixels from the input grid that belong to any object whose color matches the identified target color. Preserve their original locations and color.
  Preserved_Properties:
    - Grid dimensions
    - Position of objects matching the target color
    - Shape of objects matching the target color
    - Color of objects matching the target color
  Removed_Elements:
    - All non-background pixels whose color does not match the target color.
