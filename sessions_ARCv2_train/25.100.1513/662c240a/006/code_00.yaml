Grid:
  - Type: Input
    Properties:
      - Dimensions: Variable (e.g., 16x16)
      - Background_Color: Black (0)
      - Pixels: Each pixel has a color value (integer).
      - Non-Background_Pixels: Pixels with color > 0.
  - Type: Output
    Properties:
      - Dimensions: Same as input
      - Background_Color: Black (0)
      - Pixels: A subset of the input non-background pixels, plus background pixels.
Transformation:
  Action: Color Frequency Filtering
  Rule_Steps:
    - Step 1: Calculate Color Frequencies
      - Method: Count the total number of occurrences (pixels) for each distinct non-background color present in the input grid.
      - Exclude: Background color (0) is ignored in this count.
    - Step 2: Identify Target Color(s)
      - Method: Determine the maximum count among all non-background colors calculated in Step 1.
      - Selection: The target color(s) are all non-background colors that achieve this maximum count. Handle cases with no non-background colors (output is all background).
    - Step 3: Filter Pixels
      - Method: Create an output grid of the same size, initialized entirely with the background color.
      - Selection: Iterate through the input grid. If a pixel's color is one of the identified target colors, copy its color and position to the output grid. Otherwise, the corresponding output pixel remains the background color.
  Preserved_Properties:
    - Grid dimensions
    - Position of pixels matching the target color(s)
    - Color of pixels matching the target color(s)
  Removed_Elements:
    - All non-background pixels whose color does not match the target color(s).
    - All background pixels remain background unless replaced by a target color pixel.
