Grid:
  - Type: Input
    Dimensions: 16x16 (rows x columns)
    Background_Color: Black (0)
    Objects:
      - Object_1:
          Type: Shape
          Shape_Type: Rectangle (diagonal)
          Color: Blue (1)
          Contiguous: True
          Pixel_Count: 36 (approximate visual estimate - requires precise count)
          Description: Largest contiguous object in the grid.
      - Object_2:
          Type: Pixels
          Color: Red (2)
          Contiguous: False (appears as scattered groups/individuals)
          Pixel_Count: 9 (approximate visual estimate)
          Description: Smaller noise elements.
      - Object_3:
          Type: Pixels
          Color: Green (3)
          Contiguous: False (appears as scattered groups/individuals)
          Pixel_Count: 1 (approximate visual estimate)
          Description: Smaller noise elements.
  - Type: Output
    Dimensions: 16x16 (rows x columns)
    Background_Color: Black (0)
    Objects:
      - Object_1:
          Type: Shape
          Shape_Type: Rectangle (diagonal)
          Color: Blue (1)
          Contiguous: True
          Pixel_Count: 36 (same as input Object_1)
          Description: The single remaining object, identical to the largest object from the input.
Transformation:
  Action: Object Isolation / Filtering
  Rule: Identify all contiguous groups of non-background pixels in the input. Determine the group with the largest number of pixels. Create an output grid of the same size, initially filled with the background color, and place only the pixels corresponding to the largest identified group from the input into the output grid at their original locations.
  Preserved_Properties:
    - Grid dimensions
    - Position of the largest object
    - Shape of the largest object
    - Color of the largest object
  Removed_Elements:
    - All non-background pixels not part of the largest contiguous object.
    - Original background pixels replaced by the largest object remain replaced.
