The blue pixels form a large, solid, diagonally oriented rectangular shape. The red and green pixels appear as smaller, scattered groups or individual pixels, seemingly disconnected from the main blue shape and from each other.\n\nThe output image retains only the blue rectangular shape from the input, maintaining its exact position, size, shape, and color. All other pixels (red, green, and the original black background pixels not covered by the blue shape) are replaced with the black background color.\n\nThe core transformation appears to be an object isolation process. Specifically, it identifies the largest contiguous object (the blue rectangle in this case) and filters out all other smaller objects or \"noise\" pixels, preserving only the largest object against a clean background.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
