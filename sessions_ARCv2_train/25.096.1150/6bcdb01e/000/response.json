Cells with the value 3 in the input grid also remain unchanged (value 3) in the output grid.\n6.  **Spatial Relationship:** The change from 7 to 3 appears to depend on the spatial arrangement and connectivity. Specifically, it seems related to the proximity or reachability from cells initially containing the value 3. The 7s that change to 3s seem to form connected regions (horizontally and vertically adjacent) that include or touch the original 3s. The 8s seem to act as barriers, blocking this transformation or connection.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
