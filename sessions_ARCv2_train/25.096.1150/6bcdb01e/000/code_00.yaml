task_description: Apply a flood fill transformation starting from '3' cells.
elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - content: cells containing numerical digits (3, 7, 8)
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - type: grid element
      - value: integer (3, 7, or 8)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
      - adjacency: connected horizontally or vertically to neighboring cells
relationships:
  - type: connectivity
    description: Cells with value 7 can be connected horizontally or vertically to other cells with value 7 or 3.
  - type: barrier
    description: Cells with value 8 block connectivity and are not changed.
actions:
  - action: identify_seeds
    input: input_grid
    output: list of coordinates for cells with value 3
    description: Find all cells initially containing the value 3.
  - action: flood_fill
    input: input_grid, seed_coordinates
    output: modified_grid
    description: >
      Starting from the seed cells (value 3), change the value of all reachable
      adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically) that contain the value 7 to 3.
      This process continues recursively/iteratively through newly changed cells.
      Cells with value 8 are barriers and stop the fill.
  - action: copy_unchanged
    input: input_grid
    output: partial_output_grid
    description: >
      Copy cells with values 3 and 8 from the input grid to the output grid
      at their original positions. Copy cells with value 7 that were *not*
      reached by the flood_fill.
transformation:
  - step: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: Identify all 'seed' cells in the input grid (those with value 3).
  - step: Perform a flood fill starting from the seed cells.
  - step: >
      The fill propagates horizontally and vertically to adjacent cells.
      If a cell contains 7, change its value to 3 in the output grid and continue the fill from this cell.
  - step: The fill cannot enter or pass through cells containing 8.
  - step: Cells that were initially 3 or 8 remain unchanged.
  - step: Cells that were initially 7 but were not reached by the flood fill remain 7.
