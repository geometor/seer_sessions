Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both inputs and outputs are 2D grids (matrices) containing numerical digits.
2.  **Grid Dimensions:** The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the dimensions of the input grid in each example.
3.  **Cell Values:** The grids contain the digits 3, 7, and 8.
4.  **Key Transformation:** The primary change observed is that some cells with the value 7 in the input grid are changed to the value 3 in the output grid.
5.  **Value Persistence:** Cells with the value 8 in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid. Cells with the value 3 in the input grid also remain unchanged (value 3) in the output grid.
6.  **Spatial Relationship:** The change from 7 to 3 appears to depend on the spatial arrangement and connectivity. Specifically, it seems related to the proximity or reachability from cells initially containing the value 3. The 7s that change to 3s seem to form connected regions (horizontally and vertically adjacent) that include or touch the original 3s. The 8s seem to act as barriers, blocking this transformation or connection.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Apply a flood fill transformation starting from '3' cells.
elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - content: cells containing numerical digits (3, 7, 8)
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - type: grid element
      - value: integer (3, 7, or 8)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
      - adjacency: connected horizontally or vertically to neighboring cells
relationships:
  - type: connectivity
    description: Cells with value 7 can be connected horizontally or vertically to other cells with value 7 or 3.
  - type: barrier
    description: Cells with value 8 block connectivity and are not changed.
actions:
  - action: identify_seeds
    input: input_grid
    output: list of coordinates for cells with value 3
    description: Find all cells initially containing the value 3.
  - action: flood_fill
    input: input_grid, seed_coordinates
    output: modified_grid
    description: >
      Starting from the seed cells (value 3), change the value of all reachable
      adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically) that contain the value 7 to 3.
      This process continues recursively/iteratively through newly changed cells.
      Cells with value 8 are barriers and stop the fill.
  - action: copy_unchanged
    input: input_grid
    output: partial_output_grid
    description: >
      Copy cells with values 3 and 8 from the input grid to the output grid
      at their original positions. Copy cells with value 7 that were *not*
      reached by the flood_fill.
transformation:
  - step: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: Identify all 'seed' cells in the input grid (those with value 3).
  - step: Perform a flood fill starting from the seed cells.
  - step: >
      The fill propagates horizontally and vertically to adjacent cells.
      If a cell contains 7, change its value to 3 in the output grid and continue the fill from this cell.
  - step: The fill cannot enter or pass through cells containing 8.
  - step: Cells that were initially 3 or 8 remain unchanged.
  - step: Cells that were initially 7 but were not reached by the flood fill remain 7.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Identify the locations (row, column coordinates) of all cells in the input grid that contain the value 3. These are the starting points ("seeds") for the transformation.
3.  Maintain a list or queue of locations to process, initially populated with the seed locations identified in step 2.
4.  While there are locations left to process:
    a.  Select a location from the list.
    b.  Examine its four adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right), if they exist within the grid boundaries.
    c.  For each neighbor:
        i.  If the neighbor cell in the *input* grid contains the value 7 AND its corresponding cell in the *output* grid currently contains 7 (meaning it hasn't been processed/changed yet):
            1.  Change the value of this neighbor cell in the *output* grid to 3.
            2.  Add the location of this neighbor cell to the list of locations to process.
5.  The final state of the output grid is the result of the transformation. (Cells initially containing 3 or 8, and 7s not reachable from the initial 3s via a path of 7s, retain their original values).
