The properties of this component (its bounding box, size, and maximum value) determine the structure and content of the output grid.\n4.  **Core Logic:** The process seems to be:\n    *   Find the single connected component of non-zero cells in the input (using orthogonal adjacency).\n    *   Determine the component's bounding box (`min_row`, `min_col`, `max_row`, `max_col`), height (`h`), and width (`w`).\n    *   Calculate a size parameter `s = h * w`.\n    *   Find the maximum numerical value (`max_val`) within the component.\n    *   Create an empty 9x9 output grid.\n    *   Draw two squares in the output grid, both filled with `max_val`.\n        *   The first square has its top-left corner at `(min_row, min_col)` and size `s x s`.\n        *   The second square has its top-left corner at `(min_row + s, min_col + s)` and size `s x s`.\n    *   Ensure drawing stays within the 9x9 output grid boundaries.\n\n**Fact Specification:**\n\n"

If there are no non-zero cells, output a 9x9 grid filled with zeros and stop.\n3.  Select one non-zero cell and find the connected component it belongs to, considering only non-zero cells and orthogonal connections (up, down, left, right).\n4.  Determine the minimum row (`min_r`), maximum row (`max_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), and maximum column (`max_c`) coordinates occupied by the cells in this component (this defines the bounding box).\n5.  Calculate the height (`h`) of the bounding box as `max_r - min_r + 1`.\n6.  Calculate the width (`w`) of the bounding box as `max_c - min_c + 1`.\n7.  Calculate a size factor `s = h * w`.\n8.  Find the maximum integer value (`max_val`) present in any cell belonging to the identified component.\n9.  Create a 9x9 output grid and initialize all its cells to zero.\n10. Draw the first square: For each cell `(r, c)` in the output grid where `min_r <= r < min_r + s` and `min_c <= c < min_c + s`, set the cell's value to `max_val`. (Ensure `r` and `c` remain within the 0-8 range).\n11. Draw the second square: For each cell `(r, c)` in the output grid where `min_r + s <= r < min_r + s + s` and `min_c + s <= c < min_c + s + s`, set the cell's value to `max_val`. (Ensure `r` and `c` remain within the 0-8 range).\n12. Output the final 9x9 grid."
