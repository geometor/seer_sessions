      - cell_type: integer
      - cell_range: non-negative
  - element: non_zero_component
    properties:
      - source: input_grid
      - definition: A group of connected non-zero cells (orthogonal adjacency). Assumed to be a single component per input.
      - attributes:
          - bounding_box: [min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col]
          - height: number of rows in bounding box
          - width: number of columns in bounding box
          - max_value: the maximum integer value within the component cells
          - derived_size: height * width
objects:
  - object: input_grid
    description: The source 3x3 numerical grid.
  - object: non_zero_component
    description: The identified connected block of non-zero values in the input grid.
  - object: output_grid
    description: The target 9x9 numerical grid.
  - object: generated_square
    description: A square shape drawn onto the output grid. Two such squares are generated.
    properties:
      - fill_value: max_value from the non_zero_component
      - size: derived_size x derived_size (from non_zero_component)
      - position: determined by the non_zero_component's bounding_box top-left corner and derived_size.
relationships:
  - type: determination
    from: non_zero_component
    to: generated_square properties (fill_value, size, position)
  - type: composition
    from: generated_square (two instances)
    to: output_grid (squares are drawn onto the initially zero grid)
