"""
Transforms a 3x3 input grid into a 9x9 output grid based on a connected component of non-zero values.

1. Find the connected component of non-zero cells in the 3x3 input grid (using orthogonal adjacency).
2. Determine the bounding box (min/max row/col), height (h), width (w), and the maximum value (max_val) within this component.
3. Calculate a size factor 's' as h * w.
4. Create an empty 9x9 output grid filled with zeros.
5. Draw two squares onto the output grid, both filled with max_val:
   - The first square has its top-left corner at (min_row, min_col) and size s x s.
   - The second square has its top-left corner at (min_row + s, min_col + s) and size s x s.
6. Ensure drawing operations stay within the 9x9 grid boundaries.
7. If the input grid contains only zeros, return a 9x9 grid of zeros.
