Find the connected component of non-zero cells in the 3x3 input grid (using orthogonal adjacency).\n2. Determine the bounding box (min/max row/col), height (h), width (w), and the maximum value (max_val) within this component.\n3. Calculate a size factor 's' as h * w.\n4. Create an empty 9x9 output grid filled with zeros.\n5. Draw two squares onto the output grid, both filled with max_val:\n   - The first square has its top-left corner at (min_row, min_col) and size s x s.\n   - The second square has its top-left corner at (min_row + s, min_col + s) and size s x s.\n6. Ensure drawing operations stay within the 9x9 grid boundaries.\n7. If the input grid contains only zeros, return a 9x9 grid of zeros.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _find_connected_component(grid: list[list[int]]) -> tuple[set[tuple[int, int]], int, int, int, int, int] | None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first connected component of non-zero cells and its properties.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple containing:\n        - set of (row, col) tuples representing the component cells.\n        - min_row\n        - min_col\n        - max_row\n        - max_col\n        - max_value within the component\n        Returns None if no non-zero cells are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    visited = set()\n    component_cells = set()\n    start_node = None\n    max_val = 0\n\n    # Find the first non-zero cell to start the search\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] != 0:\n                start_node = (r, c)\n                break\n        if start_node:\n            break\n\n    if not start_node:\n        return None # No non-zero cells found\n\n    # Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the connected component\n    queue = collections.deque([start_node])\n    visited.add(start_node)\n    min_r, min_c = start_node\n    max_r, max_c = start_node\n\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if cell is non-zero (redundant if starting correctly, but safe)\n        if grid[r][c] == 0:\n             continue # Should not happen if started from non-zero and only explore non-zeros\n\n        component_cells.add((r, c))\n        max_val = max(max_val, grid[r][c])\n        min_r = min(min_r, r)\n        min_c = min(min_c, c)\n        max_r = max(max_r, r)\n        max_c = max(max_c, c)\n\n        # Explore neighbors (orthogonal)\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] != 0 and (nr, nc) not in visited:\n                visited.add((nr, nc))\n                queue.append((nr, nc))\n                \n    if not component_cells: # Should not happen if start_node was found\n         return None\n\n    return component_cells, min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c, max_val\n\n\ndef _draw_square(grid: list[list[int]], top_r: int, top_c: int, size: int, value: int):\n    \"\"\"Draws a square of 'value' onto the grid within bounds.\"\"\"\n    grid_size = len(grid) # Assuming square grid for output (9x9)\n    for r in range(top_r, top_r + size):\n        for c in range(top_c, top_c + size):\n            # Check bounds before drawing\n            if 0 <= r < grid_size and 0 <= c < grid_size:\n                grid[r][c] = value\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the rules based on the non-zero component.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_rows, output_cols = 9, 9\n    # Initialize output_grid with zeros\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(output_cols)] for _ in range(output_rows)]\n\n    # Find the connected component and its properties\n    component_info = _find_connected_component(input_grid)\n\n    # If no component found (all zeros), return the empty output grid\n    if component_info is None:\n        return output_grid\n\n    component_cells, min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c, max_val = component_info\n\n    # Calculate height, width, and size factor 's'\n    height = max_r - min_r + 1\n    width = max_c - min_c + 1\n    size_factor_s = height * width\n\n    # Draw the first square\n    _draw_square(output_grid, min_r, min_c, size_factor_s, max_val)\n\n    # Draw the second square, offset by 's'\n    _draw_square(output_grid, min_r + size_factor_s, min_c + size_factor_s, size_factor_s, max_val)\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
