"""
Selects a 3-line block from a 9-line input based on the sum of the numbers in the first line modulo 4.

1. Read the 9 lines of the input grid.
2. Identify the three integers (`n1`, `n2`, `n3`) in the first row (`input_grid[0]`).
3. Calculate the sum `S = n1 + n2 + n3`.
4. Calculate the remainder `M = S % 4`.
5. Determine the starting row index for the output block based on `M`:
   - If `M` is 0, the starting index is 0 (Block 1).
   - If `M` is 1, the starting index is 6 (Block 3).
   - If `M` is 2, the starting index is 6 (Block 3).
   - If `M` is 3, the starting index is 3 (Block 2).
6. Extract the 3 rows from the input grid starting at the determined index (rows `index` to `index + 2`).
7. Return these 3 extracted rows as the output grid.
