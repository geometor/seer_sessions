Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output consist of multiple lines. Each line contains three space-separated single-digit integers.
2.  **Input Structure:** The input consistently has 9 lines. These 9 lines can be naturally grouped into three contiguous blocks of 3 lines each (Block 1: lines 1-3, Block 2: lines 4-6, Block 3: lines 7-9).
3.  **Output Structure:** The output consistently has 3 lines.
4.  **Transformation:** The output is always one of the three blocks identified in the input. The task is to determine the rule for selecting which block becomes the output.
5.  **Selection Key:** Comparing the examples, the block selected doesn't follow a simple positional sequence (e.g., always first, always last). The selection seems dependent on the content of the input, specifically the numbers in the very first line of the input.

**Analysis of Selection Rule:**

Let the first line of the input be `[n1, n2, n3]`.
Let `S = n1 + n2 + n3`.
Let `M = S mod 4`.

*   **Example 1:** First line `2 2 2`. S = 6. M = 6 mod 4 = 2. Output is Block 3 (lines 7-9).
*   **Example 2:** First line `1 5 5`. S = 11. M = 11 mod 4 = 3. Output is Block 2 (lines 4-6).
*   **Example 3:** First line `8 8 4`. S = 20. M = 20 mod 4 = 0. Output is Block 1 (lines 1-3).
*   **Example 4:** First line `8 9 8`. S = 25. M = 25 mod 4 = 1. Output is Block 3 (lines 7-9).

This reveals a consistent mapping:
*   M = 0 -> Select Block 1
*   M = 1 -> Select Block 3
*   M = 2 -> Select Block 3
*   M = 3 -> Select Block 2

**Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  Input:
    Type: Text block
    Structure: 9 lines, each with 3 space-separated integers (0-9).
    Grouping: Can be viewed as 3 consecutive blocks (Block 1: lines 1-3, Block 2: lines 4-6, Block 3: lines 7-9).
  Output:
    Type: Text block
    Structure: 3 lines, each with 3 space-separated integers.
    Origin: A direct copy of one of the three blocks from the input.

Transformation:
  Action: Select one block from the input.
  Selection_Basis:
    Source: The first line of the input.
    Calculation:
      1. Read the three integers from the first line.
      2. Calculate their sum (S).
      3. Compute the remainder when S is divided by 4 (M = S mod 4).
    Mapping (M to Block Index):
      0: Block 1 (lines 1-3)
      1: Block 3 (lines 7-9)
      2: Block 3 (lines 7-9)
      3: Block 2 (lines 4-6)
  Result: Output the selected 3-line block.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the 9 lines of the input text.
2.  Identify the three integers (`n1`, `n2`, `n3`) on the first line.
3.  Calculate the sum `S = n1 + n2 + n3`.
4.  Calculate the remainder `M = S % 4`.
5.  Determine the starting line index for the output block based on `M`:
    *   If `M` is 0, the starting line index is 0 (Block 1).
    *   If `M` is 1, the starting line index is 6 (Block 3).
    *   If `M` is 2, the starting line index is 6 (Block 3).
    *   If `M` is 3, the starting line index is 3 (Block 2).
6.  Extract the 3 lines from the input starting at the determined index (i.e., lines `index` to `index + 2`).
7.  Output these 3 extracted lines.
