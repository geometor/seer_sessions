Each line contains three space-separated single-digit integers.\n2.  **Input Structure:** The input consistently has 9 lines. These 9 lines can be naturally grouped into three contiguous blocks of 3 lines each (Block 1: lines 1-3, Block 2: lines 4-6, Block 3: lines 7-9).\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output consistently has 3 lines.\n4.  **Transformation:** The output is always one of the three blocks identified in the input. The task is to determine the rule for selecting which block becomes the output.\n5.  **Selection Key:** Comparing the examples, the block selected doesn't follow a simple positional sequence (e.g., always first, always last). The selection seems dependent on the content of the input, specifically the numbers in the very first line of the input.\n\n**Analysis of Selection Rule:**\n\nLet the first line of the input be `[n1, n2, n3]`.\nLet `S = n1 + n2 + n3`.\nLet `M = S mod 4`.\n\n*   **Example 1:** First line `2 2 2`. S = 6. M = 6 mod 4 = 2. Output is Block 3 (lines 7-9).\n*   **Example 2:** First line `1 5 5`. S = 11. M = 11 mod 4 = 3. Output is Block 2 (lines 4-6).\n*   **Example 3:** First line `8 8 4`. S = 20. M = 20 mod 4 = 0. Output is Block 1 (lines 1-3).\n*   **Example 4:** First line `8 9 8`. S = 25. M = 25 mod 4 = 1. Output is Block 3 (lines 7-9).\n\nThis reveals a consistent mapping:\n*   M = 0 -> Select Block 1\n*   M = 1 -> Select Block 3\n*   M = 2 -> Select Block 3\n*   M = 3 -> Select Block 2\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
