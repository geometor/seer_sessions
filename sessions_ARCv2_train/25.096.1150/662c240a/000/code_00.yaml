Data:
  Input:
    Type: Text block
    Structure: 9 lines, each with 3 space-separated integers (0-9).
    Grouping: Can be viewed as 3 consecutive blocks (Block 1: lines 1-3, Block 2: lines 4-6, Block 3: lines 7-9).
  Output:
    Type: Text block
    Structure: 3 lines, each with 3 space-separated integers.
    Origin: A direct copy of one of the three blocks from the input.

Transformation:
  Action: Select one block from the input.
  Selection_Basis:
    Source: The first line of the input.
    Calculation:
      1. Read the three integers from the first line.
      2. Calculate their sum (S).
      3. Compute the remainder when S is divided by 4 (M = S mod 4).
    Mapping (M to Block Index):
      0: Block 1 (lines 1-3)
      1: Block 3 (lines 7-9)
      2: Block 3 (lines 7-9)
      3: Block 2 (lines 4-6)
  Result: Output the selected 3-line block.
