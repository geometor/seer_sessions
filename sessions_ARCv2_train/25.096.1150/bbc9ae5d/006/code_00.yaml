objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - contains non-zero integers potentially followed by zeros
      - has a total length L
      - has a first element (fill_digit) if L > 0
      - may contain zero elements (value 0)
  - name: output_states
    type: list of lists of integers
    properties:
      - stores the sequence state at each step (initial + R replacements)
      - the first state is a copy of the input_sequence
      - subsequent states are generated iteratively
      - the total number of states is R + 1, where R = (L + 2) // 3
  - name: fill_digit
    type: integer
    properties:
      - derived from the first element of the input_sequence
      - used to replace zeros
  - name: zero_element
    type: integer (value 0)
    properties:
      - placeholder targeted for replacement
actions:
  - name: get_input_sequence
    input: none (assumed available as list[int])
    output: input_sequence
  - name: identify_fill_digit
    input: input_sequence
    output: fill_digit
  - name: calculate_replacement_steps
    input: length L of input_sequence
    output: number of replacements R = (L + 2) // 3
  - name: iterative_replacement
    input: current_sequence_state (list), fill_digit
    output: next_sequence_state (list)
    process: find the index of the first zero, replace it with fill_digit
  - name: format_output
    input: list of sequence states (list of lists of integers)
    output: single string with each state formatted and newline-separated
relationships:
  - The number of replacement steps (R) depends on the length (L) of the input_sequence.
  - Each output state (after the first) is the result of applying the iterative_replacement action to the previous state.
  - The replacement process uses the fill_digit identified from the initial input_sequence.
