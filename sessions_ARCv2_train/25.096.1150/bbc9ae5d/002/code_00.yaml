objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers # Updated: Input is directly a list
    properties:
      - contains one or more non-zero integers, potentially followed by zeros
      - has a total length L
      - has a first element (fill_digit)
      - may contain zero elements (value 0)
  - name: output_lines
    type: list of strings # Each string represents a sequence state
    properties:
      - the first line represents the initial input_sequence, formatted as a string
      - subsequent lines show the state after each replacement step
      - the total number of lines is R + 1, where R = (L + 2) // 3
  - name: fill_digit
    type: integer
    properties:
      - derived from the first element of the input_sequence
      - used to replace zero_elements
  - name: zero_element
    type: integer (value 0)
    properties:
      - placeholder targeted for replacement
actions:
  - name: receive_input # Updated: No parsing needed
    input: list of integers
    output: input_sequence (list of integers)
  - name: identify_fill_digit
    input: input_sequence
    output: fill_digit
  - name: calculate_replacement_steps
    input: length L of input_sequence
    output: number of replacements R = (L + 2) // 3
  - name: iterative_replacement
    input: current_sequence (list), fill_digit
    output: next_sequence (list)
    process: find the index of the first zero_element, replace it with fill_digit
  - name: format_sequence_to_string # Renamed for clarity
    input: list of integers
    output: space-separated string
relationships:
  - The number of replacement steps (R) depends on the length (L) of the input_sequence via R = (L + 2) // 3.
  - Each output line string (after the first) represents the state of the sequence after applying the iterative_replacement action to the sequence state from the previous line.
  - The replacement process uses the fill_digit identified from the initial input_sequence.
  - The process generates exactly R+1 sequence states (including the initial one).
