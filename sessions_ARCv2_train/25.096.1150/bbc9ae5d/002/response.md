## General Assessment

The error message `'list' object has no attribute 'split'` consistently occurs across all examples. This strongly indicates that the `transform` function, designed to accept a *string* as input and parse it internally, is instead receiving a *list* of integers directly from the testing environment.

The core logic identified previously (iterative replacement of the leftmost zero with the first element's value, repeated `R = (L + 2) // 3` times) appears fundamentally sound based on the input/output pairs. The error stems purely from a mismatch in the expected input type.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  Modify the `transform` function signature and internal logic to accept a `list[int]` as input directly, removing the initial string parsing step (`parse_input_string`).
2.  Retain the rest of the transformation logic, including calculating `L` and `R`, identifying the `fill_digit`, performing iterative replacements, and formatting the final output sequence lists into strings.

## Metrics and Verification

Let's verify the relationship between input length (L) and the number of replacement steps (R) required. The hypothesized formula is `R = (L + 2) // 3`. The total number of output lines should be `R + 1`.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]`
    *   L = 6
    *   Expected R = (6 + 2) // 3 = 8 // 3 = 2
    *   Expected Output Lines = 2 + 1 = 3.
    *   Actual Output Lines = 3. **Matches.**
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   L = 8
    *   Expected R = (8 + 2) // 3 = 10 // 3 = 3
    *   Expected Output Lines = 3 + 1 = 4.
    *   Actual Output Lines = 4. **Matches.**
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   L = 10
    *   Expected R = (10 + 2) // 3 = 12 // 3 = 4
    *   Expected Output Lines = 4 + 1 = 5.
    *   Actual Output Lines = 5. **Matches.**
*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: `[7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   L = 6
    *   Expected R = (6 + 2) // 3 = 8 // 3 = 2
    *   Expected Output Lines = 2 + 1 = 3.
    *   Actual Output Lines = 3. **Matches.**
*   **Example 5:**
    *   Input: `[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   L = 6
    *   Expected R = (6 + 2) // 3 = 8 // 3 = 2
    *   Expected Output Lines = 2 + 1 = 3.
    *   Actual Output Lines = 3. **Matches.**

The calculation for the number of replacement steps `R` based on the input length `L` holds true for all provided examples. The core transformation logic appears correct; only the input handling needs adjustment.

## Facts


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers # Updated: Input is directly a list
    properties:
      - contains one or more non-zero integers, potentially followed by zeros
      - has a total length L
      - has a first element (fill_digit)
      - may contain zero elements (value 0)
  - name: output_lines
    type: list of strings # Each string represents a sequence state
    properties:
      - the first line represents the initial input_sequence, formatted as a string
      - subsequent lines show the state after each replacement step
      - the total number of lines is R + 1, where R = (L + 2) // 3
  - name: fill_digit
    type: integer
    properties:
      - derived from the first element of the input_sequence
      - used to replace zero_elements
  - name: zero_element
    type: integer (value 0)
    properties:
      - placeholder targeted for replacement
actions:
  - name: receive_input # Updated: No parsing needed
    input: list of integers
    output: input_sequence (list of integers)
  - name: identify_fill_digit
    input: input_sequence
    output: fill_digit
  - name: calculate_replacement_steps
    input: length L of input_sequence
    output: number of replacements R = (L + 2) // 3
  - name: iterative_replacement
    input: current_sequence (list), fill_digit
    output: next_sequence (list)
    process: find the index of the first zero_element, replace it with fill_digit
  - name: format_sequence_to_string # Renamed for clarity
    input: list of integers
    output: space-separated string
relationships:
  - The number of replacement steps (R) depends on the length (L) of the input_sequence via R = (L + 2) // 3.
  - Each output line string (after the first) represents the state of the sequence after applying the iterative_replacement action to the sequence state from the previous line.
  - The replacement process uses the fill_digit identified from the initial input_sequence.
  - The process generates exactly R+1 sequence states (including the initial one).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Receive** the input as a list of integers, let's call it `current_sequence`.
2.  **Determine** the total length `L` of `current_sequence`. Handle the edge case where `L` is 0 (return an empty string or handle as appropriate).
3.  **Calculate** the number of replacement steps `R` using the formula `R = (L + 2) // 3` (integer division).
4.  **Identify** the `fill_digit` by taking the first element of `current_sequence`.
5.  **Initialize** an empty list to store the output sequences (as lists of integers).
6.  **Add** a copy of the initial `current_sequence` to the list of output sequences.
7.  **Repeat** the following `R` times:
    a.  **Find** the index of the first occurrence of `0` in the `current_sequence`.
    b.  If a `0` is found at `index_zero`:
        i.  **Create** a copy of the `current_sequence`.
        ii. **Update** the element at `index_zero` in the copied sequence to be the `fill_digit`.
        iii. **Set** `current_sequence` to this updated copied sequence (this becomes the sequence for the *next* iteration).
        iv. **Add** the newly updated sequence (the copy created in step 7.b.i, now modified) to the list of output sequences.
    c.  If no `0` is found, **stop** the loop (all possible replacements within the `R` steps have been made).
8.  **Convert** each sequence (list of integers) stored in the output sequences list into a space-separated string.
9.  **Join** these strings with newline characters to produce the final multi-line output string.
