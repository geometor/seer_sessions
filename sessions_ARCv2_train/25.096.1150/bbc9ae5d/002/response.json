            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe error message `'list' object has no attribute 'split'` consistently occurs across all examples. This strongly indicates that the `transform` function, designed to accept a *string* as input and parse it internally, is instead receiving a *list* of integers directly from the testing environment.\n\nThe core logic identified previously (iterative replacement of the leftmost zero with the first element's value, repeated `R = (L + 2) // 3` times) appears fundamentally sound based on the input/output pairs. The error stems purely from a mismatch in the expected input type.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  Modify the `transform` function signature and internal logic to accept a `list[int]` as input directly, removing the initial string parsing step (`parse_input_string`).\n2.  Retain the rest of the transformation logic, including calculating `L` and `R`, identifying the `fill_digit`, performing iterative replacements, and formatting the final output sequence lists into strings.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nLet's verify the relationship between input length (L) and the number of replacement steps (R) required. The hypothesized formula is `R = (L + 2) // 3`. The total number of output lines should be `R + 1`.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]`\n    *   L = 6\n    *   Expected R = (6 + 2) // 3 = 8 // 3 = 2\n    *   Expected Output Lines = 2 + 1 = 3.\n    *   Actual Output Lines = 3. **Matches.**\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   L = 8\n    *   Expected R = (8 + 2) // 3 = 10 // 3 = 3\n    *   Expected Output Lines = 3 + 1 = 4.\n    *   Actual Output Lines = 4. **Matches.**\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   L = 10\n    *   Expected R = (10 + 2) // 3 = 12 // 3 = 4\n    *   Expected Output Lines = 4 + 1 = 5.\n    *   Actual Output Lines = 5. **Matches.**\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: `[7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   L = 6\n    *   Expected R = (6 + 2) // 3 = 8 // 3 = 2\n    *   Expected Output Lines = 2 + 1 = 3.\n    *   Actual Output Lines = 3. **Matches.**\n*   **Example 5:**\n    *   Input: `[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   L = 6\n    *   Expected R = (6 + 2) // 3 = 8 // 3 = 2\n    *   Expected Output Lines = 2 + 1 = 3.\n    *   Actual Output Lines = 3. **Matches.**\n\nThe calculation for the number of replacement steps `R` based on the input length `L` holds true for all provided examples. The core transformation logic appears correct; only the input handling needs adjustment.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
