Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

### Perception of the Elements

1.  **Input:** The input is a single string containing space-separated integers. It always starts with one or more non-zero integers, followed by zero or more zeros.
2.  **Output:** The output consists of multiple lines. Each line is also a string of space-separated integers.
3.  **Relationship:** The first line of the output is identical to the input string. Each subsequent line is derived from the previous line by changing the leftmost '0' to the first non-zero digit found in the original input.
4.  **Transformation Process:** The transformation seems to be an iterative process of "filling" the zeros from left to right using a specific digit.
5.  **Fill Digit:** The digit used for filling is consistently the *first* digit encountered in the input string.
6.  **Number of Steps:** The process generates a specific number of output lines (including the initial input line). Let's call the number of *replacement* steps `R` (total lines = `R + 1`). Observing the examples:
    *   train\_1: Input length L=6, R=2 replacements.
    *   train\_2: Input length L=8, R=3 replacements.
    *   train\_3: Input length L=10, R=4 replacements.
    *   train\_4: Input length L=6, R=2 replacements.
    *   train\_5: Input length L=6, R=2 replacements.
    The number of replacements `R` appears to be determined by the total length `L` of the input sequence, specifically `R = ceil(L / 3)`, or calculated using integer division as `R = (L + 2) // 3`.
7.  **Termination:** The process performs exactly `R` replacement steps, generating `R+1` lines in total.

### Facts

objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - contains non-zero integers followed by zeros
      - has a total length L
      - has a first non-zero digit (fill_digit)
      - has Z zeros
  - name: output_lines
    type: list of strings (each representing a sequence of integers)
    properties:
      - the first line matches the input_sequence string representation
      - subsequent lines are generated iteratively
      - the total number of lines is R + 1, where R = (L + 2) // 3
  - name: fill_digit
    type: integer
    properties:
      - derived from the first element of the input_sequence
      - used to replace zeros
  - name: zero_element
    type: integer (value 0)
    properties:
      - placeholder to be replaced
actions:
  - name: parse_input
    input: input string
    output: input_sequence (list of integers)
  - name: identify_fill_digit
    input: input_sequence
    output: fill_digit
  - name: calculate_replacement_steps
    input: length L of input_sequence
    output: number of replacements R = (L + 2) // 3
  - name: iterative_replacement
    input: current_sequence (list), fill_digit
    output: next_sequence (list)
    process: find the index of the first zero, replace it with fill_digit
  - name: format_output
    input: list of integers
    output: space-separated string
relationships:
  - The number of replacement steps (R) depends on the length (L) of the input_sequence.
  - Each output line (after the first) is the result of applying the iterative_replacement action to the sequence represented by the previous line.
  - The replacement process uses the fill_digit identified from the initial input_sequence.
```


### Natural Language Program

1.  **Read** the input string and **parse** it into a list of integers, let's call it `current_sequence`.
2.  **Determine** the total length `L` of `current_sequence`.
3.  **Calculate** the number of replacement steps `R` using the formula `R = (L + 2) // 3` (integer division, equivalent to ceiling of L/3).
4.  **Identify** the `fill_digit` by taking the first element of `current_sequence`.
5.  **Initialize** an empty list to store the output lines.
6.  **Format** the initial `current_sequence` into a space-separated string and **add** it to the output lines list.
7.  **Repeat** the following `R` times:
    a.  **Find** the index of the first occurrence of `0` in the `current_sequence`.
    b.  If a `0` is found at `index_zero`:
        i.  **Create** a copy of `current_sequence`.
        ii. **Update** the element at `index_zero` in the copied sequence to be the `fill_digit`.
        iii. **Set** `current_sequence` to this updated copied sequence.
        iv. **Format** the new `current_sequence` into a space-separated string and **add** it to the output lines list.
    c.  If no `0` is found (i.e., all zeros have already been replaced within the R steps), stop the loop early. (This condition might not be strictly necessary if `Z >= R` always holds for the calculated R, but it's safe to include).
8.  **Print** each string in the output lines list, each on a new line.

## General Assessment

The provided code failed execution across all examples with the error `'list' object has no attribute 'split'`. This clearly indicates a discrepancy between the expected input type in the `transform` function (designed for a `string`) and the actual input type provided during testing (which was a `list` of integers).

The core transformation logic identified previously (iterative replacement of the leftmost zero with the first element's value) appears sound based on the input/output pairs. The number of replacement steps calculation (`R = (L + 2) // 3`) also seems consistent with the examples.

The strategy to resolve this is straightforward:
1.  Modify the `transform` function to accept a `list[int]` as its primary input instead of a `str`.
2.  Remove the initial string parsing step (`parse_string_to_list`) as it's no longer needed.
3.  Ensure the rest of the logic correctly operates on the input list.
4.  Adjust the final output formatting to join the generated string representations of the sequence states.

## Metrics Gathering

The code execution failed before any meaningful metrics could be gathered about the transformation process itself. However, analyzing the provided examples yields the following:

| Example   | Input List                    | Length (L) | First Element (Fill Digit) | Zeros | Calculated Steps (R = (L+2)//3) | Output Lines | Matches R+1? |

| train\_4 | `[7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`          | 6          | 7                          | 5     | (6+2)//3 = 2                    | 3            | Yes          |
| train\_5 | `[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`          | 6          | 1                          | 4     | (6+2)//3 = 2                    | 3            | Yes          |

The formula `R = (L + 2) // 3` correctly predicts the number of *replacement steps* needed, resulting in `R + 1` total output lines, which matches all training examples.

      - the total number of states is R + 1, where R = (L + 2) // 3
  - name: fill_digit
    type: integer
    properties:
      - derived from the first element of the input_sequence
      - used to replace zeros
  - name: zero_element
    type: integer (value 0)
    properties:
      - placeholder targeted for replacement
actions:
  - name: get_input_sequence
    input: none (assumed available as list[int])
    output: input_sequence
  - name: identify_fill_digit
    input: input_sequence
    output: fill_digit
  - name: calculate_replacement_steps
    input: length L of input_sequence
    output: number of replacements R = (L + 2) // 3
  - name: iterative_replacement
    input: current_sequence_state (list), fill_digit
    output: next_sequence_state (list)
    process: find the index of the first zero, replace it with fill_digit
  - name: format_output
    input: list of sequence states (list of lists of integers)
    output: single string with each state formatted and newline-separated
relationships:
  - The number of replacement steps (R) depends on the length (L) of the input_sequence.
  - Each output state (after the first) is the result of applying the iterative_replacement action to the previous state.
  - The replacement process uses the fill_digit identified from the initial input_sequence.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Receive** the input as a `list` of integers, let's call it `initial_sequence`.
2.  **Determine** the total length `L` of `initial_sequence`. Handle the case of an empty list (return an empty string or appropriate default).
3.  **Calculate** the number of replacement steps `R` using the formula `R = (L + 2) // 3` (integer division).
4.  **Identify** the `fill_digit` by taking the first element of `initial_sequence`.
5.  **Initialize** an empty list, `output_states`, to store the sequence state at each step (as lists of integers).
6.  **Create** a working copy of the `initial_sequence`, let's call it `current_sequence`.
7.  **Add** a copy of the `current_sequence` (the initial state) to `output_states`.
8.  **Repeat** the following `R` times:
    a.  **Find** the index (`index_zero`) of the first occurrence of `0` in the `current_sequence`.
    b.  If `index_zero` is found (is not None):
        i.  **Modify** `current_sequence` by replacing the element at `index_zero` with the `fill_digit`.
        ii. **Add** a *copy* of the modified `current_sequence` to `output_states`.
    c.  If `index_zero` is not found (no zeros left), **stop** the loop (break).
9.  **Convert** each list in `output_states` into a space-separated string.
10. **Join** these formatted strings with newline characters (`\n`) to create the final output string.
11. **Return** the final output string.
