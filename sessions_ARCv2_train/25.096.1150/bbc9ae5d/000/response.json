            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n### Perception of the Elements\n\n1.  **Input:** The input is a single string containing space-separated integers. It always starts with one or more non-zero integers, followed by zero or more zeros.\n2.  **Output:** The output consists of multiple lines. Each line is also a string of space-separated integers.\n3.  **Relationship:** The first line of the output is identical to the input string. Each subsequent line is derived from the previous line by changing the leftmost '0' to the first non-zero digit found in the original input.\n4.  **Transformation Process:** The transformation seems to be an iterative process of \"filling\" the zeros from left to right using a specific digit.\n5.  **Fill Digit:** The digit used for filling is consistently the *first* digit encountered in the input string.\n6.  **Number of Steps:** The process generates a specific number of output lines (including the initial input line). Let's call the number of *replacement* steps `R` (total lines = `R + 1`). Observing the examples:\n    *   train\\_1: Input length L=6, R=2 replacements.\n    *   train\\_2: Input length L=8, R=3 replacements.\n    *   train\\_3: Input length L=10, R=4 replacements.\n    *   train\\_4: Input length L=6, R=2 replacements.\n    *   train\\_5: Input length L=6, R=2 replacements.\n    The number of replacements `R` appears to be determined by the total length `L` of the input sequence, specifically `R = ceil(L / 3)`, or calculated using integer division as `R = (L + 2) // 3`.\n7.  **Termination:** The process performs exactly `R` replacement steps, generating `R+1` lines in total.\n\n### Facts\n\n"
