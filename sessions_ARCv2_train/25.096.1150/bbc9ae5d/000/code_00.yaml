objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - contains non-zero integers followed by zeros
      - has a total length L
      - has a first non-zero digit (fill_digit)
      - has Z zeros
  - name: output_lines
    type: list of strings (each representing a sequence of integers)
    properties:
      - the first line matches the input_sequence string representation
      - subsequent lines are generated iteratively
      - the total number of lines is R + 1, where R = (L + 2) // 3
  - name: fill_digit
    type: integer
    properties:
      - derived from the first element of the input_sequence
      - used to replace zeros
  - name: zero_element
    type: integer (value 0)
    properties:
      - placeholder to be replaced
actions:
  - name: parse_input
    input: input string
    output: input_sequence (list of integers)
  - name: identify_fill_digit
    input: input_sequence
    output: fill_digit
  - name: calculate_replacement_steps
    input: length L of input_sequence
    output: number of replacements R = (L + 2) // 3
  - name: iterative_replacement
    input: current_sequence (list), fill_digit
    output: next_sequence (list)
    process: find the index of the first zero, replace it with fill_digit
  - name: format_output
    input: list of integers
    output: space-separated string
relationships:
  - The number of replacement steps (R) depends on the length (L) of the input_sequence.
  - Each output line (after the first) is the result of applying the iterative_replacement action to the sequence represented by the previous line.
  - The replacement process uses the fill_digit identified from the initial input_sequence.
