objects:
  - name: input_string
    type: string
    properties:
      - contains space-separated integers
      - represents the initial state of the sequence
  - name: sequence_state
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - derived by parsing the input_string or from a previous state
      - has a total length L
      - potentially contains zero elements
  - name: fill_digit
    type: integer
    properties:
      - derived from the first element of the initial sequence_state
      - used to replace zeros
  - name: zero_element
    type: integer (value 0)
    properties:
      - placeholder targeted for replacement
  - name: output_string
    type: string
    properties:
      - contains multiple lines separated by newlines
      - each line is a space-separated string representation of a sequence_state
      - the first line represents the initial state
      - subsequent lines represent states after replacements
      - total number of lines is R + 1, where R = (length L + 2) // 3
actions:
  - name: parse_string_to_list
    input: input_string
    output: initial sequence_state (list of integers)
  - name: identify_fill_digit
    input: initial sequence_state
    output: fill_digit
  - name: calculate_replacement_steps
    input: length L of sequence_state
    output: number of replacements R = (L + 2) // 3
  - name: iterative_replacement
    input: current_sequence_state (list), fill_digit
    output: next_sequence_state (list)
    process: find index of first zero, replace it with fill_digit, return new list copy
  - name: format_list_to_string
    input: sequence_state (list of integers)
    output: space-separated string representation
  - name: generate_output_string
    input: list of sequence_states (each a list of integers)
    output: final output_string (newline-separated)
relationships:
  - The number of replacement steps (R) depends on the length (L) of the sequence derived from the input_string.
  - Each output line string (after the first) corresponds to a sequence_state resulting from applying the iterative_replacement action to the previous state.
  - The replacement process uses the fill_digit identified from the initial sequence_state.
