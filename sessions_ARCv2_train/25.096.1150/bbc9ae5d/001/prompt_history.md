Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

### Perception of the Elements

1.  **Input:** The input is a single string containing space-separated integers. It always starts with one or more non-zero integers, followed by zero or more zeros.
2.  **Output:** The output consists of multiple lines. Each line is also a string of space-separated integers.
3.  **Relationship:** The first line of the output is identical to the input string. Each subsequent line is derived from the previous line by changing the leftmost '0' to the first non-zero digit found in the original input.
4.  **Transformation Process:** The transformation seems to be an iterative process of "filling" the zeros from left to right using a specific digit.
5.  **Fill Digit:** The digit used for filling is consistently the *first* digit encountered in the input string.
6.  **Number of Steps:** The process generates a specific number of output lines (including the initial input line). Let's call the number of *replacement* steps `R` (total lines = `R + 1`). Observing the examples:
    *   train\_1: Input length L=6, R=2 replacements.
    *   train\_2: Input length L=8, R=3 replacements.
    *   train\_3: Input length L=10, R=4 replacements.
    *   train\_4: Input length L=6, R=2 replacements.
    *   train\_5: Input length L=6, R=2 replacements.
    The number of replacements `R` appears to be determined by the total length `L` of the input sequence, specifically `R = ceil(L / 3)`, or calculated using integer division as `R = (L + 2) // 3`.
7.  **Termination:** The process performs exactly `R` replacement steps, generating `R+1` lines in total.

### Facts


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - contains non-zero integers followed by zeros
      - has a total length L
      - has a first non-zero digit (fill_digit)
      - has Z zeros
  - name: output_lines
    type: list of strings (each representing a sequence of integers)
    properties:
      - the first line matches the input_sequence string representation
      - subsequent lines are generated iteratively
      - the total number of lines is R + 1, where R = (L + 2) // 3
  - name: fill_digit
    type: integer
    properties:
      - derived from the first element of the input_sequence
      - used to replace zeros
  - name: zero_element
    type: integer (value 0)
    properties:
      - placeholder to be replaced
actions:
  - name: parse_input
    input: input string
    output: input_sequence (list of integers)
  - name: identify_fill_digit
    input: input_sequence
    output: fill_digit
  - name: calculate_replacement_steps
    input: length L of input_sequence
    output: number of replacements R = (L + 2) // 3
  - name: iterative_replacement
    input: current_sequence (list), fill_digit
    output: next_sequence (list)
    process: find the index of the first zero, replace it with fill_digit
  - name: format_output
    input: list of integers
    output: space-separated string
relationships:
  - The number of replacement steps (R) depends on the length (L) of the input_sequence.
  - Each output line (after the first) is the result of applying the iterative_replacement action to the sequence represented by the previous line.
  - The replacement process uses the fill_digit identified from the initial input_sequence.
```


### Natural Language Program

1.  **Read** the input string and **parse** it into a list of integers, let's call it `current_sequence`.
2.  **Determine** the total length `L` of `current_sequence`.
3.  **Calculate** the number of replacement steps `R` using the formula `R = (L + 2) // 3` (integer division, equivalent to ceiling of L/3).
4.  **Identify** the `fill_digit` by taking the first element of `current_sequence`.
5.  **Initialize** an empty list to store the output lines.
6.  **Format** the initial `current_sequence` into a space-separated string and **add** it to the output lines list.
7.  **Repeat** the following `R` times:
    a.  **Find** the index of the first occurrence of `0` in the `current_sequence`.
    b.  If a `0` is found at `index_zero`:
        i.  **Create** a copy of `current_sequence`.
        ii. **Update** the element at `index_zero` in the copied sequence to be the `fill_digit`.
        iii. **Set** `current_sequence` to this updated copied sequence.
        iv. **Format** the new `current_sequence` into a space-separated string and **add** it to the output lines list.
    c.  If no `0` is found (i.e., all zeros have already been replaced within the R steps), stop the loop early. (This condition might not be strictly necessary if `Z >= R` always holds for the calculated R, but it's safe to include).
8.  **Print** each string in the output lines list, each on a new line.
