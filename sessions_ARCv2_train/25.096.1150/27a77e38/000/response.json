All other cells remain unchanged.\n4.  **Target Cell:** The modified cell is always located in the *last* row of the grid. Its column index appears to be the *middle* column of the grid.\n5.  **Target Value:** The new value placed in the target cell seems determined by the numbers present in the grid *above* the row of 5s. Specifically, it's the digit that appears most frequently in that top section. If multiple digits share the highest frequency, the smallest of those digits is chosen.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
