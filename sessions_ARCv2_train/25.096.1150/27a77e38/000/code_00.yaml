task_elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of single-digit integers.
    properties:
      - rows: Variable number.
      - columns: Variable number.
      - structure: Contains a distinct row composed entirely of '5's, separating an upper block of varied digits from a lower block of '0's.

derived_elements:
  - object: five_row
    description: The row within the grid where all elements are the digit 5.
    properties:
      - index: The row number where the five_row is located.
  - object: upper_subgrid
    description: The subgrid containing all rows above the five_row.
    properties:
      - contents: A 2D array of digits.
      - dimensions: rows = index of five_row, columns = original grid columns.
  - object: target_value
    description: The digit to be placed in the modified cell.
    calculation: The digit that occurs most frequently within the upper_subgrid. In case of a frequency tie, the smallest digit among the tied ones is chosen.
  - object: target_cell
    description: The single cell in the grid that is modified.
    properties:
      - row_index: The index of the last row in the grid.
      - column_index: The index of the middle column of the grid (floor(number_of_columns / 2)).

actions:
  - action: identify_five_row
    description: Locate the row index containing only 5s.
  - action: extract_upper_subgrid
    description: Create a subgrid from rows 0 up to (but not including) the five_row.
  - action: calculate_digit_frequencies
    description: Count the occurrences of each digit (0-9) within the upper_subgrid.
  - action: determine_target_value
    description: Find the digit with the maximum frequency in the upper_subgrid, using the smallest digit as a tie-breaker.
  - action: determine_target_column
    description: Calculate the middle column index based on the grid's width.
  - action: determine_target_row
    description: Identify the index of the last row of the grid.
  - action: modify_grid
    description: Create the output grid by copying the input grid and updating the value of the target_cell (at target_row, target_column) to the target_value.

relationships:
  - relationship: five_row_separates_grid
    description: The five_row acts as a delimiter between the upper_subgrid and the lower zero rows.
  - relationship: upper_subgrid_determines_value
    description: The frequency analysis of digits within the upper_subgrid determines the target_value.
  - relationship: grid_dimensions_determine_column
    description: The width of the grid determines the target_column (middle column).
  - relationship: grid_dimensions_determine_row
    description: The height of the grid determines the target_row (last row).
