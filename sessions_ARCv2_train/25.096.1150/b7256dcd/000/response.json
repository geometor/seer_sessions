Regions of '6's change their value based on a single, unique neighbouring non-6, non-7 value.\n    2.  Some of the original \"source\" numbers (non-6, non-7) are changed to '7', either because they successfully influenced a region of '6's or because they were isolated (surrounded by '7's).\n*   Connectivity (specifically 4-way adjacency) is crucial for defining regions of '6's and determining influence.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
