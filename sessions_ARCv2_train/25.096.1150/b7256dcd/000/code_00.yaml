elements:
  - object: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: variable (height x width), preserved in transformation
  - object: Cell
    properties:
      - coordinates: (row, column)
      - value: integer
      - neighbors: adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)
  - object: Number (Value)
    properties:
      - role: specific roles based on value
        - 7: Background/Default (mostly stable)
        - 6: Mutable (changes based on context)
        - Others (1, 3, 4,...): Potential Sources/Influencers
  - object: Component
    properties:
      - type: Connected group of cells
      - criteria: cells have value '6', connected via 4-way adjacency
      - border_cells: cells adjacent to the component but not part of it
      - border_values: values of border_cells, filtered (non-6, non-7)

actions:
  - name: Identify_6_Components
    input: Input Grid
    output: Set of Components (each a set of cell coordinates)
  - name: Determine_Component_Fate
    input: Input Grid, Component
    process:
      - Find border_cells for the Component.
      - Get border_values (non-6, non-7) from border_cells in Input Grid.
      - If exactly one unique value 'v' exists in border_values:
        - Mark Component cells to become 'v'.
        - Identify source cells (border cells with value 'v').
    output: Updated values for component cells, Set of source cell coordinates
  - name: Update_Sources_And_Isolated
    input: Input Grid, Output Grid (partially updated), Set of source_cells
    process:
      - Iterate through Input Grid cells (r, c).
      - If input[r, c] is non-6, non-7:
        - If (r, c) is in source_cells, set output[r, c] = 7.
        - Else if all neighbors of input[r, c] are 7, set output[r, c] = 7.
    output: Final Output Grid

relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    between: Cells (4-way: up, down, left, right)
  - type: Membership
    between: Cell, Component
  - type: Influence
    from: Source Cell (non-6, non-7)
    to: Adjacent Component of 6s
