"""
Transforms a 2D grid based on the following rules:
1. Identifies connected components of cells with the value '6'.
2. For each '6' component, it examines the values of adjacent cells (neighbors).
3. If exactly one unique value 'v' (other than '6' or '7') exists among the neighbors, all cells in that '6' component are changed to 'v' in the output grid. The neighboring cells with value 'v' that caused this change are marked as 'source cells'.
4. After processing all '6' components, the grid is scanned again.
5. Any cell whose original value was not '6' or '7' is changed to '7' in the output grid if:
    a. It was marked as a 'source cell' in step 3.
    b. Or, if all of its neighbors in the original input grid had the value '7' (i.e., it was isolated by '7's).
6. Cells with the value '7' generally remain unchanged, as do '6' components that did not meet the condition in step 3.
