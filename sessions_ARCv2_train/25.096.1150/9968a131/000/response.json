Rows at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) remain identical to the input.\n    *   For the modified (odd-indexed) rows, the transformation involves a right circular shift of a specific segment of three consecutive elements.\n    *   The starting position of this 3-element segment seems dependent on the value of the first element in that specific row.\n        *   In `train_1`, the odd rows start with `7`, and the segment shifted is at indices `[1, 2, 3]`.\n        *   In `train_2`, the odd rows start with `5`, and the segment shifted is at indices `[0, 1, 2]`.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
