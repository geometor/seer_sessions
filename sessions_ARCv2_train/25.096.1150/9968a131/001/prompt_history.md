*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   The input and output are structured as grids (matrices) of single-digit integers.
    *   The dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the grid remain unchanged between input and output.
    *   The transformation operates on a row-by-row basis.
    *   A key pattern observed is that only rows at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) are modified. Rows at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) remain identical to the input.
    *   For the modified (odd-indexed) rows, the transformation involves a right circular shift of a specific segment of three consecutive elements.
    *   The starting position of this 3-element segment seems dependent on the value of the first element in that specific row.
        *   In `train_1`, the odd rows start with `7`, and the segment shifted is at indices `[1, 2, 3]`.
        *   In `train_2`, the odd rows start with `5`, and the segment shifted is at indices `[0, 1, 2]`.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the row index (starting from 0).
    3.  For each row:
        a.  Check if the row index is odd.
        b.  If the row index is even, copy the input row directly to the corresponding row in the output grid.
        c.  If the row index is odd:
            i.  Examine the value of the first element (at index 0) of the current input row.
            ii. If the first element's value is 7:
                - Identify the segment of elements at indices 1, 2, and 3.
                - Perform a right circular shift on this 3-element segment: the element at index 3 moves to index 1, the element at index 1 moves to index 2, and the element at index 2 moves to index 3.
                - Construct the output row by keeping the element at index 0 the same and placing the shifted segment at indices 1, 2, and 3, followed by any remaining elements (if the row is longer than 4 elements).
            iii.If the first element's value is 5:
                - Identify the segment of elements at indices 0, 1, and 2.
                - Perform a right circular shift on this 3-element segment: the element at index 2 moves to index 0, the element at index 0 moves to index 1, and the element at index 1 moves to index 2.
                - Construct the output row by placing the shifted segment at indices 0, 1, and 2, followed by the remaining elements from index 3 onwards.
            iv. Copy the newly constructed or modified row to the corresponding row in the output grid.
    4.  Return the completed output grid.
