In the examples, they are 3x3 grids.\n2.  **Grid Cells:** Each cell contains a single digit (0-9). The digit '0' appears to represent an empty or background state. Non-zero digits represent distinct \"colors\" or \"objects\".\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation seems to operate column by column. Within each column, non-zero digits \"propagate\" or \"fall\" downwards, filling any '0' cells below them. This propagation continues until the bottom of the grid is reached or another non-zero digit is encountered in that column. The original non-zero digits remain in their positions.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
