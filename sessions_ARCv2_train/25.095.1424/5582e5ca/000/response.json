The output is also a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, but all elements within the output grid are identical. This suggests an aggregation or selection operation on the input grid to determine a single value, which is then used to populate the entire output grid. Comparing the input and output grids across the examples reveals that the value used to fill the output grid is the digit that appears most frequently in the corresponding input grid.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
