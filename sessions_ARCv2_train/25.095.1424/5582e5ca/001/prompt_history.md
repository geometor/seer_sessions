## train_1

**input:**
```
6 8 9
1 8 1
9 4 9
```


**output:**
```
9 9 9
9 9 9
9 9 9
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
4 4 8
6 4 3
6 3 0
```


**output:**

4 4 4
4 4 4
```


## train_3

**input:**
```

*   **Perception:** The input is consistently a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. The output is also a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, but all elements within the output grid are identical. This suggests an aggregation or selection operation on the input grid to determine a single value, which is then used to populate the entire output grid. Comparing the input and output grids across the examples reveals that the value used to fill the output grid is the digit that appears most frequently in the corresponding input grid.

```yaml
    task_elements:
      - object: input_grid
        type: grid
        rows: 3
        columns: 3
        cell_type: integer (single digit)
        description: The source data for the transformation.
      - object: output_grid
        type: grid
        rows: 3
        columns: 3
        cell_type: integer (single digit)
        property: uniform_value
        description: The result of the transformation, filled with a single value derived from the input.
      - object: derived_value
        type: integer (single digit)
        description: The single value used to populate the output grid.
    relationships:
      - type: derivation
        from: input_grid
        to: derived_value
        rule: The derived_value is the integer that occurs most frequently within the input_grid.
      - type: population
        from: derived_value
        to: output_grid
        rule: All cells in the output_grid are set to the derived_value.
    actions:
      - action: count_frequencies
        on: input_grid
        description: Determine the count of each unique digit within the input grid.
      - action: find_mode
        on: frequencies
        output: derived_value
        description: Identify the digit with the highest frequency count.
      - action: generate_output
        using: derived_value
        output: output_grid
        description: Create a 3x3 grid where every cell contains the derived_value.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Examine the input 3x3 grid of digits.
    2.  Count the occurrences of each unique digit (0 through 9) present in the input grid.
    3.  Identify the digit that has the highest frequency (the mode).
    4.  Construct a new 3x3 grid.
    5.  Fill every cell of the new grid with the most frequent digit found in step 3.
    6.  Output the newly constructed grid.
