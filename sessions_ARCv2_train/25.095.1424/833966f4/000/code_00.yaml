Output:
  Type: List
  Length: 5
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Source: Same elements as input, reordered

  Action: Swap elements based on position
  Details:
    - Swap the element at index 0 with the element at index 1.
    - Keep the element at index 2 in its original position.
    - Swap the element at index 3 with the element at index 4.
Relationships:
  - Input and Output lists contain the same set of elements.
  - The transformation depends on the index (position) of the elements within the list.
