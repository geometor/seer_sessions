## train_1

**input:**
```
4 4 4 4 4 4
8 8 8 8 8 8
```


**output:**
```
4 8 4 8 4 8
8 4 8 4 8 4
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9
```


**output:**
```
3 9 3 9 3 9
9 3 9 3 9 3
```

## Perception

The input consists of two lines, each containing a sequence of identical numbers separated by spaces. The length of the sequence appears consistent within an example.

The output also consists of two lines.
1.  The first output line is generated by alternating the number from the first input line and the number from the second input line, starting with the number from the first input line. The length of this output line matches the length of the input lines.
2.  The second output line is generated by alternating the number from the second input line and the number from the first input line, starting with the number from the second input line. The length of this output line also matches the length of the input lines.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Interleave numbers from two input lines

Input:
  - object: Input Data
    properties:
      - format: Two lines of text
      - content: Each line contains a sequence of identical numbers separated by spaces.
      - structure:
          - line_1: Represents the first sequence (e.g., '4 4 4 4 4 4')
          - line_2: Represents the second sequence (e.g., '8 8 8 8 8 8')
    attributes:
      - number_1: The unique number present in line_1 (e.g., 4)
      - number_2: The unique number present in line_2 (e.g., 8)
      - sequence_length: The count of numbers in each input line (e.g., 6)

Output:
  - object: Output Data
    properties:
      - format: Two lines of text
      - content: Each line contains a sequence of alternating numbers derived from the input.
      - structure:
          - output_line_1: Result of interleaving number_1 and number_2, starting with number_1.
          - output_line_2: Result of interleaving number_2 and number_1, starting with number_2.
    attributes:
      - length: Matches the sequence_length of the input lines.

Relationships:
  - output_line_1 is generated by taking number_1, then number_2, then number_1, and so on, for the determined sequence_length.
  - output_line_2 is generated by taking number_2, then number_1, then number_2, and so on, for the determined sequence_length.

Actions:
  - Parse: Extract the unique number from each input line (number_1, number_2).
  - Determine: Find the count of numbers in an input line (sequence_length).
  - Generate: Construct the two output lines by alternating the extracted numbers according to the specified starting number and sequence length.
  - Format: Join the generated numbers with spaces to form the output lines.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Read the two lines of input.
2.  From the first input line, identify the unique number (let's call it `num1`) and count how many times it appears (let's call this `count`).
3.  From the second input line, identify the unique number (let's call it `num2`).
4.  Generate the first output line: Create a sequence of length `count` by alternating `num1` and `num2`, starting with `num1`. Join these numbers with spaces.
5.  Generate the second output line: Create a sequence of length `count` by alternating `num2` and `num1`, starting with `num2`. Join these numbers with spaces.
6.  Output the two generated lines.
