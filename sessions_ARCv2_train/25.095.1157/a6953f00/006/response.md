**General Assessment:**

The error `invalid literal for int() with base 10: '...'` across all training examples indicates a mismatch between the data type returned by the `transform` function and the data type expected by the evaluation environment. The function currently returns a formatted string representation of the 2x2 grid (e.g., `"8 2\n4 7"`), while the testing harness appears to expect a nested list or array of integers (e.g., `[[8, 2], [4, 7]]`). The core logic for identifying the correct 2x2 subgrid based on the input grid width's parity seems correct and consistent with the examples.

**Strategy:**

The strategy is to modify the `transform` function to return the extracted 2x2 subgrid as a nested list of integers (`List[List[int]]`) instead of formatting it into a string. This involves removing the final string formatting step and directly returning the computed subgrid data structure.

**Metrics and Analysis:**

Let's verify the input processing and expected output structure for each example:

*   **Train 1:**
    *   Input Grid (parsed): `[[7, 5, 8, 2], [8, 0, 4, 7], [1, 6, 4, 7], [8, 9, 6, 9]]`
    *   Number of Columns (N): 4 (Even)
    *   Calculated `start_col`: N - 2 = 2
    *   Extracted Elements (Indices): `grid[0][2]`, `grid[0][3]`, `grid[1][2]`, `grid[1][3]`
    *   Extracted Values: 8, 2, 4, 7
    *   Expected Output Structure: `[[8, 2], [4, 7]]`
    *   Current Code Output: `"8 2\n4 7"` (Causes Error)

*   **Train 2:**
    *   Input Grid (parsed): `[[0, 7, 9], [5, 6, 5], [3, 7, 9]]`
    *   Number of Columns (N): 3 (Odd)
    *   Calculated `start_col`: 0
    *   Extracted Elements (Indices): `grid[0][0]`, `grid[0][1]`, `grid[1][0]`, `grid[1][1]`
    *   Extracted Values: 0, 7, 5, 6
    *   Expected Output Structure: `[[0, 7], [5, 6]]`
    *   Current Code Output: `"0 7\n5 6"` (Causes Error)

*   **Train 3:**
    *   Input Grid (parsed): `[[5, 8, 8, 9, 2], [8, 0, 5, 6, 5], [7, 7, 2, 2, 9], [5, 5, 1, 7, 4], [3, 3, 8, 7, 7]]`
    *   Number of Columns (N): 5 (Odd)
    *   Calculated `start_col`: 0
    *   Extracted Elements (Indices): `grid[0][0]`, `grid[0][1]`, `grid[1][0]`, `grid[1][1]`
    *   Extracted Values: 5, 8, 8, 0
    *   Expected Output Structure: `[[5, 8], [8, 0]]`
    *   Current Code Output: `"5 8\n8 0"` (Causes Error)

The analysis confirms the selection logic is sound, but the final output format needs correction.

**Updated Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a 2D grid of integers (assume it's already parsed, e.g., into a list of lists or NumPy array).
2.  Check if the input grid has at least 2 rows and 2 columns. If not, handle the error case (e.g., return an empty list or raise an error, depending on exact requirements).
3.  Determine the number of columns (`N`) in the input grid.
4.  Calculate the starting column index (`start_col`) for the output subgrid:
    *   If `N` is even, set `start_col = N - 2`.
    *   If `N` is odd, set `start_col = 0`.
5.  Extract the 2x2 subgrid from the input grid by taking the elements at:
    *   Row 0, Column `start_col`
    *   Row 0, Column `start_col + 1`
    *   Row 1, Column `start_col`
    *   Row 1, Column `start_col + 1`
6.  Construct a new 2x2 grid (e.g., a list of lists: `[[val_00, val_01], [val_10, val_11]]`) using the extracted values.
7.  Return this 2x2 grid structure as the result.
