Many cells contain the digit 0, while others contain a single non-zero digit (e.g., 7 in example 1, 2 in example 2, 8 in example 3, 1 in example 4).\n\nThe output is a sequence of integers. The length of the output sequence corresponds to the number of non-zero elements present in the input grid. The values in the output sequence are the non-zero digits found in the input grid.\n\nThe transformation appears to involve extracting the non-zero elements from the input grid and forming an output sequence with them. The order of elements in the output sequence seems to follow a standard reading order (row by row, left to right) of the non-zero elements in the input grid.\n\n## Documented Facts\n\n"
