task_elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array (list of lists)
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - element_type: integer
      - content: contains zero and non-zero single-digit integers

  - object: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: 1D array (list)
      - element_type: integer
      - content: derived from non-zero elements of input_grid

relations:
  - type: derivation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_sequence
    details: The output sequence consists of all non-zero integer values found within the input grid.

  - type: order_correspondence
    element1: non-zero values in input_grid (scanned row-major)
    element2: elements in output_sequence
    details: The order of elements in the output sequence matches the order in which the corresponding non-zero values appear when scanning the input grid row by row, from left to right.

  - type: cardinality_correspondence
    element1: count of non-zero values in input_grid
    element2: length of output_sequence
    details: The number of elements in the output sequence is equal to the total count of non-zero values in the input grid.

actions:
  - name: scan_grid
    input: input_grid
    details: Iterate through the cells of the grid, typically row by row, left to right.
  - name: filter_non_zero
    input: cell_value
    output: cell_value (if non-zero) or nothing (if zero)
    details: Check if the value in a cell is not equal to zero.
  - name: collect_values
    input: non-zero_values
    output: output_sequence
    details: Append the identified non-zero values, in the order they were encountered during the scan, to form the final output sequence.
