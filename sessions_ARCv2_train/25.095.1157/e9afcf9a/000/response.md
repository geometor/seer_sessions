**Perception:**

The input consists of two lines. Each line contains a sequence of the same number repeated multiple times, separated by spaces. The output also consists of two lines, each containing a sequence of numbers separated by spaces. The length of the sequences in the output lines is the same as the length of the sequences in the input lines.

The first output line is generated by alternating the number from the first input line and the number from the second input line, starting with the number from the first input line.

The second output line is generated by alternating the number from the second input line and the number from the first input line, starting with the number from the second input line.

**Facts:**

relationships:
  - type: Transformation
    description: The input numbers and sequence length are used to generate the output lines.
  - type: Patterning
    description: Output lines are formed by alternating Number1 and Number2.
    details:
      - First output line pattern starts with Number1 (Number1, Number2, Number1, ...).
      - Second output line pattern starts with Number2 (Number2, Number1, Number2, ...).
actions:
  - action: Parse Input
    steps:
      - Read the first line to identify Number1 and SequenceLength.
      - Read the second line to identify Number2.
  - action: Generate Output Line 1
    steps:
      - Create a sequence of length SequenceLength.
      - Fill the sequence by alternating Number1 and Number2, starting with Number1.
      - Format the sequence as space-separated numbers.
  - action: Generate Output Line 2
    steps:
      - Create a sequence of length SequenceLength.
      - Fill the sequence by alternating Number2 and Number1, starting with Number2.
      - Format the sequence as space-separated numbers.
  - action: Format Output
    steps:
      - Combine the generated Output Line 1 and Output Line 2, separated by a newline character.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the first line of the input. Extract the first number encountered (let this be `num1`) and count the total number of elements in this line (let this be `length`).
2.  Read the second line of the input. Extract the first number encountered (let this be `num2`).
3.  Create the first output line: Iterate `length` times. For even positions (0, 2, 4,...), use `num1`. For odd positions (1, 3, 5,...), use `num2`. Join these numbers with spaces.
4.  Create the second output line: Iterate `length` times. For even positions (0, 2, 4,...), use `num2`. For odd positions (1, 3, 5,...), use `num1`. Join these numbers with spaces.
5.  Output the first created line, followed by a newline, followed by the second created line.
