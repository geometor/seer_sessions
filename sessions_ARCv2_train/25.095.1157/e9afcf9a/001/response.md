```python
"""
Reads two lines of input, each containing the same number repeated.
Extracts the number from the first line (num1), the number from the second line (num2),
and the length of the sequences (length).
Generates two output lines:
1.  Alternates num1 and num2 for 'length' elements, starting with num1.
2.  Alternates num2 and num1 for 'length' elements, starting with num2.
Returns the two generated lines as a list of lists.
