"""
Transforms a 3x3 input grid containing 0s and 2s into a single integer output (1 or 7). 
The transformation rule is based on the count of adjacent (horizontal or vertical) pairs of '2's.
- If the count of adjacent '2' pairs is 1, 2, or 3, the output is 7.
- If the count is 0 or 4 or more, the output is 1.
