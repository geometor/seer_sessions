Task: Grid pattern analysis based on adjacency count
Input:
  Type: 2D Grid
  Dimensions: 3x3
  Cell_Values: Integer (0 or 2)
  Objects:
    - name: grid_cell
      properties:
        - value: 0 or 2
        - position: (row, column) coordinates
Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a side (horizontal or vertical connection). Diagonal connection does not count.
  - Adjacent Pair: An instance where two adjacent cells both contain the value '2'.
Transformation_Rule: The output is determined by the total count of adjacent pairs of '2's within the grid.
  - Count Calculation:
      1. Iterate through grid cells, checking for horizontal adjacent pairs (cell[r, c] == 2 and cell[r, c+1] == 2).
      2. Iterate through grid cells, checking for vertical adjacent pairs (cell[r, c] == 2 and cell[r+1, c] == 2).
      3. Sum the counts from steps 1 and 2 to get the total `adjacent_pairs_count`.
  - Output Determination:
      - If `adjacent_pairs_count` is 1, 2, or 3: Output is 7
      - If `adjacent_pairs_count` is 0 or 4 or more: Output is 1
Output:
  Type: Integer
  Possible_Values: 1 or 7
