```python
"""
Applies a downward propagation transformation to each column of a 2D integer grid independently.

1. Creates a new grid, `output_grid`, initially identical to the `input_grid`.
2. Iterates through each column `j` of the `input_grid` (from left to right).
3. For each column `j`, initializes a variable `last_non_zero_value` to 0.
4. Iterates through the rows `i` of the current column `j` (from top to bottom).
5. Examines the value of the cell at `input_grid[i][j]`.
6. If `input_grid[i][j]` is not zero, updates `last_non_zero_value` to this value. The corresponding cell `output_grid[i][j]` remains unchanged (it already holds the correct non-zero value).
7. If `input_grid[i][j]` is zero:
    a. Checks if `last_non_zero_value` is currently non-zero (meaning a non-zero value was encountered previously in this column scan).
    b. If `last_non_zero_value` is non-zero, updates the cell `output_grid[i][j]` to `last_non_zero_value`.
    c. If `last_non_zero_value` is zero, `output_grid[i][j]` retains its initial zero value.
8. After processing all cells in all columns, returns the `output_grid`.
