task_elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array (list of lists)
      - cell_type: integer
      - role: input_grid (source)
      - role: output_grid (result)
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer
      - state:
          - zero (empty/fillable)
          - non_zero (source/preserved)
      - position: defined by row and column index
actions:
  - action: initialize_output
    description: Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - action: process_columns
    description: Iterate through each column of the grid independently.
    parameters:
      - direction: left-to-right (e.g., column index 0 to N-1)
  - action: scan_column_downwards
    description: Iterate through rows within the current column.
    parameters:
      - direction: top-to-bottom (e.g., row index 0 to M-1)
  - action: track_last_non_zero
    description: Maintain the value of the most recently encountered non-zero cell in the current column scan *from the input grid*. Initialize to zero for each column.
  - action: update_tracker
    description: If the current cell in the *input grid* is non-zero, update the tracked value.
  - action: fill_zero_cell
    description: If the current cell in the *input grid* is zero AND a non-zero value has been tracked for this column, set the corresponding cell in the *output grid* to the tracked value.
relationships:
  - relationship: column_independence
    description: The transformation logic applied to one column does not affect other columns.
  - relationship: downward_dependency
    description: The value of a zero cell in the output grid depends on the non-zero cells located *above* it in the same column of the *input* grid.
    constraints: Only the *most recent* non-zero value encountered during the downward scan influences subsequent zero cells below it.
