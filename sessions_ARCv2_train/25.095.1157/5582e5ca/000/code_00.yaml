task_elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - cell_content: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - cell_content: single-digit integer (0-9)
      - uniformity: all cells contain the same digit
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    rule: The digit used to fill the output_grid is determined by the digit(s) that appear most frequently in the input_grid.
    tie_breaking: If multiple digits have the same highest frequency, the largest of these digits is chosen.
actions:
  - action: analyze_frequency
    target: input_grid
    purpose: count occurrences of each digit
  - action: determine_mode
    input: frequency counts
    output: the digit(s) with the highest frequency
  - action: resolve_ties
    input: mode digit(s)
    output: the single largest digit if there are multiple modes
  - action: construct_output
    input: determined digit
    output: output_grid (filled with the determined digit)
