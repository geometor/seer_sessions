task_type: sequence transformation
input_structure:
  - type: text
  - lines: 2
  - content_per_line: sequence of identical numbers separated by spaces
  - properties:
      - number_in_line_1: N1
      - number_in_line_2: N2
      - sequence_length: L (same for both lines)
output_structure:
  - type: text
  - lines: 2
  - content_per_line: sequence of alternating numbers (N1 and N2) separated by spaces
  - properties:
      - sequence_length: L (same as input)
transformation_details:
  - action: interleaving
  - source_elements:
      - number_from_input_line_1 (N1)
      - number_from_input_line_2 (N2)
  - output_line_1_pattern: N1 N2 N1 N2 ... (length L)
  - output_line_2_pattern: N2 N1 N2 N1 ... (length L)
relationships:
  - output line 1 is generated by alternating input numbers, starting with the number from input line 1.
  - output line 2 is generated by alternating input numbers, starting with the number from input line 2.
