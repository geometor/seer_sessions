**Perception:**

The input consists of two lines, each containing a sequence of identical numbers. The output also consists of two lines, derived from the input numbers. The output lines are formed by interleaving the numbers from the two input lines. The first output line starts with the number from the first input line, alternating with the number from the second input line. The second output line starts with the number from the second input line, alternating with the number from the first input line. The length of the sequences remains the same.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: sequence transformation
input_structure:
  - type: text
  - lines: 2
  - content_per_line: sequence of identical numbers separated by spaces
  - properties:
      - number_in_line_1: N1
      - number_in_line_2: N2
      - sequence_length: L (same for both lines)
output_structure:
  - type: text
  - lines: 2
  - content_per_line: sequence of alternating numbers (N1 and N2) separated by spaces
  - properties:
      - sequence_length: L (same as input)
transformation_details:
  - action: interleaving
  - source_elements:
      - number_from_input_line_1 (N1)
      - number_from_input_line_2 (N2)
  - output_line_1_pattern: N1 N2 N1 N2 ... (length L)
  - output_line_2_pattern: N2 N1 N2 N1 ... (length L)
relationships:
  - output line 1 is generated by alternating input numbers, starting with the number from input line 1.
  - output line 2 is generated by alternating input numbers, starting with the number from input line 2.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the two lines of input.
2.  Identify the number present in the first input line (let's call it `num1`).
3.  Identify the number present in the second input line (let's call it `num2`).
4.  Determine the length of the sequence (number of elements) in the input lines (let's call it `length`).
5.  Generate the first output line: Create a sequence of length `length` by alternating `num1` and `num2`, starting with `num1`. Join these numbers with spaces.
6.  Generate the second output line: Create a sequence of length `length` by alternating `num2` and `num1`, starting with `num2`. Join these numbers with spaces.
7.  Output the two generated lines.
