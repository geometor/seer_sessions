task_type: sequence transformation
input_structure:
  - type: collection (e.g., list of lists, assumed compatible with len() and indexing)
  - elements: 2 sequences (rows)
  - properties_per_sequence:
      - contains identical numerical elements
      - has a specific length (L)
  - constraints:
      - Both sequences must have the same length (L > 0).
      - Both sequences must not be empty.
input_elements:
  - number_from_sequence_1: N1 (the single unique number in the first sequence)
  - number_from_sequence_2: N2 (the single unique number in the second sequence)
  - sequence_length: L
output_structure:
  - type: collection (matching input type, e.g., list of lists)
  - elements: 2 sequences (rows)
  - properties_per_sequence:
      - contains alternating N1 and N2
      - has the same length L as the input sequences
transformation_action: interleaving
output_sequence_1_definition:
  - Starts with N1.
  - Alternates N1 and N2 for L elements.
  - Pattern: N1, N2, N1, N2, ...
output_sequence_2_definition:
  - Starts with N2.
  - Alternates N2 and N1 for L elements.
  - Pattern: N2, N1, N2, N1, ...
relationships:
  - The output sequences' length is identical to the input sequences' length.
  - The elements of the output sequences are exclusively the unique elements from the two input sequences.
  - The pattern of alternation in the two output sequences is offset by one position.
