Input:
  type: Grid (NumPy Array)
  data_type: integer
  dimensions: NxM (3x3 in examples)
  properties: Contains numerical values.
Output:
  type: Grid (NumPy Array)
  data_type: integer
  dimensions: NxM (same as input)
  properties: Contains the same numerical values as the input, but rearranged.
Transformation:
  type: Spatial Rotation
  details: Rotate the input grid by 180 degrees.
  library_function: numpy.rot90(input_array, k=2)
Relationships:
  - The output grid is the result of rotating the input grid 180 degrees around its center.
  - The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the dimensions of the input grid.
  - The multiset of values in the output grid is identical to the multiset of values in the input grid.
