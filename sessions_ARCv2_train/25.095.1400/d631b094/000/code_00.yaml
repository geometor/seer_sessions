Task: Extract Non-Zero Elements in Grid Scan Order

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Dimensions: 3x3
  Element_Type: Integer
  Properties:
    - Cells contain single-digit integers.
    - Zero (0) represents a background or ignored value.
    - Non-zero integers represent significant values.

Output:
  Type: Sequence
  Element_Type: Integer
  Properties:
    - Contains only the non-zero integers from the input grid.
    - The order of elements is determined by the grid scan order.

Transformation:
  Action: Scan Grid
  Details: Iterate through the grid cells row by row, from top to bottom. Within each row, iterate from left to right.
  Action: Filter Elements
  Details: Identify and select cells containing non-zero integer values.
  Action: Collect Elements
  Details: Gather the selected non-zero integers.
  Action: Order Elements
  Details: Arrange the collected integers into a sequence based on the order they were encountered during the grid scan.
  Action: Format Output
  Details: Present the ordered sequence of non-zero integers, typically separated by spaces.

Relationships:
  - The output sequence length is equal to the count of non-zero elements in the input grid.
  - The value of each element in the output sequence corresponds directly to a non-zero value in the input grid.
  - The position of an element in the output sequence is determined by its position in the row-major scan of the input grid relative to other non-zero elements.
