The digit `0` appears to represent an empty or background state, while non-zero digits represent significant values or objects within the grid. The output is a sequence of these non-zero digits. The transformation involves extracting the non-zero digits from the input grid and arranging them into a linear sequence. The order of the digits in the output sequence corresponds to a standard reading order of the grid: left-to-right, then top-to-bottom (row-major order).\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
