**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input consists of a 3x3 grid containing single-digit integers. The digit `0` appears to represent an empty or background state, while non-zero digits represent significant values or objects within the grid. The output is a sequence of these non-zero digits. The transformation involves extracting the non-zero digits from the input grid and arranging them into a linear sequence. The order of the digits in the output sequence corresponds to a standard reading order of the grid: left-to-right, then top-to-bottom (row-major order).

Task: Extract Non-Zero Elements in Grid Scan Order

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Dimensions: 3x3
  Element_Type: Integer
  Properties:
    - Cells contain single-digit integers.
    - Zero (0) represents a background or ignored value.
    - Non-zero integers represent significant values.

Output:
  Type: Sequence
  Element_Type: Integer
  Properties:
    - Contains only the non-zero integers from the input grid.
    - The order of elements is determined by the grid scan order.

Transformation:
  Action: Scan Grid
  Details: Iterate through the grid cells row by row, from top to bottom. Within each row, iterate from left to right.
  Action: Filter Elements
  Details: Identify and select cells containing non-zero integer values.
  Action: Collect Elements
  Details: Gather the selected non-zero integers.
  Action: Order Elements
  Details: Arrange the collected integers into a sequence based on the order they were encountered during the grid scan.
  Action: Format Output
  Details: Present the ordered sequence of non-zero integers, typically separated by spaces.

Relationships:
  - The output sequence length is equal to the count of non-zero elements in the input grid.
  - The value of each element in the output sequence corresponds directly to a non-zero value in the input grid.
  - The position of an element in the output sequence is determined by its position in the row-major scan of the input grid relative to other non-zero elements.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, starting from the top row (row 0) and proceeding to the bottom row (row 2).
2.  Within each row, iterate through each column, starting from the leftmost column (column 0) and proceeding to the rightmost column (column 2).
3.  For each cell encountered during this iteration, check if the value stored in the cell is non-zero.
4.  If the cell's value is non-zero, append this value to a list or sequence.
5.  After iterating through all cells in the grid, format the collected sequence of non-zero values into the output string, separating consecutive values with a single space.
