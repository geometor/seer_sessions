Task: Grid Connectivity Classification

Input:
  Type: 2D Grid
  Dimensions: 3x3
  Cell_Values:
    - 0: Represents open space
    - 2: Represents barriers or walls

Output:
  Type: Single Digit Integer
  Possible_Values:
    - 1: Corresponds to a specific connectivity state of '0' cells
    - 7: Corresponds to a different connectivity state of '0' cells

Relationship:
  Rule: The output value is determined by the number of connected components formed by the cells containing the value '0'.
  Connectivity_Definition: Cells are considered connected if they share an edge (up, down, left, or right - Von Neumann neighborhood). Diagonal adjacency does not count as connected.
  Condition_for_Output_1: If all '0' cells in the grid form a single connected component. This also includes the case where there are no '0' cells (vacuously true) or only one '0' cell.
  Condition_for_Output_7: If the '0' cells form two or more distinct connected components.

Examples_Analysis:
  - train_1, train_5, train_6: All '0' cells are connected into one group -> Output 1
  - train_2, train_3, train_4: The '0' cells are separated by '2's into multiple distinct groups -> Output 7
