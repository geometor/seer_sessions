The values observed are exclusively 0 and 2.\n2.  **Output:** The output is always a single numerical digit. The observed outputs are 1 and 7.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to depend on the spatial arrangement of the '0' values within the input grid. The '2' values seem to act as barriers or separators. The core logic seems related to whether the '0' cells form a single contiguous region or multiple separate regions.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Diagonal adjacency does not count as connected.\n  Condition_for_Output_1: If all '0' cells in the grid form a single connected component. This also includes the case where there are no '0' cells (vacuously true) or only one '0' cell.\n  Condition_for_Output_7: If the '0' cells form two or more distinct connected components.\n\nExamples_Analysis:\n  - train_1, train_5, train_6: All '0' cells are connected into one group -> Output 1\n  - train_2, train_3, train_4: The '0' cells are separated by '2's into multiple distinct groups -> Output 7\n```"
