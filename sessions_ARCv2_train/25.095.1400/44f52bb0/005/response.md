"""
Transforms a 3x3 grid based on the connectivity of its '0' and '2' cells.

The transformation rule depends on two derived properties:
1. C0_4way: The number of connected components formed by '0' cells, using 4-way adjacency (Von Neumann neighborhood).
2. C2_8way: The number of connected components formed by '2' cells, using 8-way adjacency (Moore neighborhood).

The output is determined as follows:
- If C2_8way is not equal to 1, the output is 1.
- If C2_8way is equal to 1:
    - If C0_4way is equal to 4, the output is 1.
    - If C0_4way is not equal to 4, the output is 7.
