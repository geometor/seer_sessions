## train_1

**input:**
```
0 2 0
7 0 8
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 2 0
7 2 8
7 2 8
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
0 0 6
0 4 0

0 4 6
3 4 6
```


## train_3

**input:**
```
4 0 0

Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output:** Both are 3x3 grids containing single digits.
*   **Cells:** Each grid position holds a single digit.
*   **Values:** The digits seem to represent different states. '0' appears to be a background or empty state. Non-zero digits (2, 7, 8, 6, 4, 3) seem to represent filled states or objects.
*   **Transformation:** The change from input to output involves filling '0' cells based on the non-zero values above them within the same column. Non-zero values seem to propagate downwards, filling any '0' cells below them until they hit another non-zero value or the bottom of the grid.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      size: 3x3
      cells:
        - type: cell
          properties:
            value: integer (0-9)
            position: [row, column]
  - type: number
    properties:
      value: integer (1-9)
      role: represents a filled state or object
  - type: zero
    properties:
      value: 0
      role: represents an empty state or background

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Cells are arranged in rows and columns.
  - type: vertical_dependency
    description: The value of a '0' cell in the output depends on the non-zero values located directly above it in the same column in the input.

actions:
  - name: fill_downwards
    actor: non-zero number
    target: zero cells below in the same column
    effect: Changes the value of the target zero cells to the value of the actor non-zero number.
    condition: The cells between the actor and the target (inclusive) must all be zeros in the original input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each column of the grid from left to right (column index `c` from 0 to 2).
3.  Within each column, iterate through the rows from top to bottom (row index `r` from 0 to 2).
4.  Maintain a variable `last_non_zero_value` for the current column, initialized to 0 before starting the row iteration for that column.
5.  For each cell `(r, c)`:
    *   If the value of the cell `(r, c)` in the *input* grid is non-zero, update `last_non_zero_value` to this value.
    *   If the value of the cell `(r, c)` in the *input* grid is zero *and* `last_non_zero_value` is not zero, set the value of the cell `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to `last_non_zero_value`.
6.  After processing all cells, the output grid contains the transformed result.
