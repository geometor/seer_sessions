## train_1

**input:**
```
6 8 9
1 8 1
9 4 9
```


**output:**
```
9 9 9
9 9 9
9 9 9
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
4 4 8
6 4 3
6 3 0
```


**output:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 4
4 4 4
```


## train_3

**input:**
```
4 6 9
6 4 1
8 8 6
```


**output:**
```
6 6 6
6 6 6
6 6 6
```

Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input:** The input is consistently a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers.
*   **Output:** The output is also consistently a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. A key characteristic of the output grid is that all its elements are identical.
*   **Transformation:** The core task seems to involve analyzing the frequency distribution of the numbers within the input grid to determine the single, uniform value that populates the output grid.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
Input:
  type: grid
  rows: 3
  columns: 3
  elements:
    type: integer
    range: 0-9
Output:
  type: grid
  rows: 3
  columns: 3
  elements:
    type: integer
    range: 0-9
    property: all elements are identical
Transformation:
  action: determine_fill_value
  based_on: frequency of numbers in the input grid
  result: a single integer value
Action:
  name: create_output_grid
  using: fill_value determined from input
  properties:
    - dimensions match input grid dimensions
    - all cells contain the determined fill_value
Relationship:
  - The value used to fill the output grid is the number that appears most frequently (the mode) in the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid of numbers.
2.  Count the occurrences of each distinct number within the input grid.
3.  Identify the number that has the highest frequency (the mode).
4.  Determine the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the input grid.
5.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
6.  Fill every cell of the new output grid with the most frequent number identified in step 3.
7.  Return the filled output grid.
