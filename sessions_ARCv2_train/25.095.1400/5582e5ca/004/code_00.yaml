Input:
  type: numpy.ndarray # Confirmed type
  shape: [3, 3]       # Based on examples
  elements:
    type: integer
    range: 0-9
Output:
  type: numpy.ndarray # Assumed consistent with input type
  shape: [3, 3]       # Matches input shape
  elements:
    type: integer
    range: 0-9
    property: all elements are identical
Transformation:
  action: determine_fill_value
  based_on: frequency of numbers (mode) in the input grid
  input_source: all elements of the input numpy.ndarray
  result: a single integer value (the mode)
Action:
  name: create_output_grid
  using: mode value determined from input
  properties:
    - dimensions match input grid dimensions (shape)
    - all cells contain the determined mode value
    - type matches input type (numpy.ndarray)
Relationship:
  - The value used to fill the output grid is the number that appears most frequently (the mode) across all elements of the input NumPy array.
  - If there are ties for the mode, the specific tie-breaking rule is not demonstrated by the examples, but standard libraries like `collections.Counter.most_common(1)` typically return one of the modes consistently.
Edge_Cases: # Based on typical programming considerations
  - Handling of empty input array (size 0) needs clarification, though not present in examples.
