objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list
    description: A sequence of single-digit integers derived from the input string, one number per line.
    properties:
      - order: significant
      - element_type: integer
      - length: variable (denoted as 'n')
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list
    description: A sequence containing largely the same numbers as the input_sequence but potentially reordered at the ends.
    properties:
      - order: significant
      - element_type: integer
      - length: same as input_sequence ('n')
  - name: first_pair
    type: tuple
    description: The elements at index 0 and index 1 of the input_sequence. Relevant if n >= 2.
  - name: last_pair
    type: tuple
    description: The elements at index n-2 and index n-1 of the input_sequence. Relevant if n >= 4.
  - name: middle_elements
    type: list
    description: The elements of the input_sequence between index 1 and index n-2. Relevant if n >= 4. These elements retain their original relative positions.

actions:
  - name: parse_input
    description: Convert the multi-line input string into a list of integers.
  - name: copy_sequence
    description: Create a mutable copy of the input sequence to serve as the basis for the output sequence.
  - name: swap_first_pair
    description: If the sequence length (n) is 2 or greater, swap the elements at index 0 and index 1 in the copied sequence.
  - name: swap_last_pair
    description: If the sequence length (n) is 4 or greater, swap the elements at index n-2 and index n-1 in the copied sequence.
  - name: format_output
    description: Convert the modified sequence back into a multi-line string, one number per line.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The first pair of elements is swapped, and the last pair of elements is swapped, provided the sequence is long enough. Middle elements are unchanged.
  - type: condition
    description: The swap of the first pair occurs only if n >= 2.
  - type: condition
    description: The swap of the last pair occurs only if n >= 4.
  - type: identity
    description: If n < 2, output_sequence is identical to input_sequence.
  - type: identity
    description: If n = 2 or n = 3, only the first pair is swapped. Middle elements (if any, i.e., at index 1 for n=3) remain unchanged relative to the swap.
  - type: correspondence
    description: If n >= 4, elements from input index 2 to n-3 map directly to output indices 2 to n-3.
