            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis suggested a transformation rule involving swapping all adjacent pairs. However, the provided code (`code_00.py`) implements a different rule: swapping only the *first* two elements and the *last* two elements of the sequence, conditional on the sequence length (at least 2 elements for the first swap, at least 4 elements for the last swap).\n\nThe execution results reported in the prompt indicate a failure for Example 1, showing `[1, 9, 8, 6]` as the output instead of the expected `[0, 9, 1, 8, 6]`. However, manually tracing `code_00.py` with the input `[9, 0, 1, 6, 8]` yields `[0, 9, 1, 8, 6]`, which *matches* the expected output. The code also correctly produces the output for Example 2.\n\nTherefore, it appears there might be an error in the reported execution results for Example 1. The current code (`code_00.py`) seems to correctly capture the transformation rule demonstrated by *both* examples. The strategy is to proceed with the understanding that the transformation involves swapping the first and last pairs, and update the documentation accordingly.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's re-evaluate the provided code (`code_00.py`) against the examples.\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Sequence: `[9, 0, 1, 6, 8]` (Length: 5)\n*   Expected Output Sequence: `[0, 9, 1, 8, 6]`\n*   Code (`code_00.py`) Execution Trace:\n    *   Initial sequence: `[9, 0, 1, 6, 8]`\n    *   Swap first pair (indices 0, 1): `[0, 9, 1, 6, 8]`\n    *   Swap last pair (indices 3, 4): `[0, 9, 1, 8, 6]`\n*   Predicted Output Sequence (`code_00.py`): `[0, 9, 1, 8, 6]`\n*   Match: Yes\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Sequence: `[4, 3, 6, 2, 8]` (Length: 5)\n*   Expected Output Sequence: `[3, 4, 6, 8, 2]`\n*   Code (`code_00.py`) Execution Trace:\n    *   Initial sequence: `[4, 3, 6, 2, 8]`\n    *   Swap first pair (indices 0, 1): `[3, 4, 6, 2, 8]`\n    *   Swap last pair (indices 3, 4): `[3, 4, 6, 8, 2]`\n*   Predicted Output Sequence (`code_00.py`): `[3, 4, 6, 8, 2]`\n*   Match: Yes\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
