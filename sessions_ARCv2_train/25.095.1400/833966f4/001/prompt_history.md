**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task takes a multi-line string as input, where each line contains a single digit. The output is also a multi-line string containing the same digits as the input, but rearranged. The core operation appears to be a reordering of the input sequence. By comparing the input and output sequences in both examples, a pattern emerges: adjacent pairs of numbers are swapped. For instance, the first number swaps places with the second, the third swaps with the fourth, and so on. If the input sequence contains an odd number of elements, the last element remains in its position relative to the preceding swapped pairs.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list
    description: A sequence of single-digit numbers derived from the input string, one number per line.
    properties:
      - order: significant
      - element_type: integer (single digit)
      - length: variable (can be odd or even)
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list
    description: A sequence containing the same numbers as the input_sequence but reordered.
    properties:
      - order: significant
      - element_type: integer (single digit)
      - length: same as input_sequence
  - name: number_pair
    type: tuple
    description: Two adjacent numbers from the input_sequence being processed together.
  - name: last_element
    type: integer
    description: The final number in the input_sequence, relevant only if the sequence length is odd.

actions:
  - name: parse_input
    description: Convert the multi-line input string into a list of integers.
  - name: iterate_in_pairs
    description: Process the input_sequence by taking elements two at a time (index 0 & 1, index 2 & 3, etc.).
  - name: swap_pair
    description: Reverse the order of the two elements within a number_pair.
  - name: append_to_output
    description: Add the processed pair (swapped) or the single last_element to the output_sequence.
  - name: handle_odd_length
    description: If the input_sequence has an odd number of elements, append the last_element directly to the output_sequence after processing all pairs.
  - name: format_output
    description: Convert the output_sequence back into a multi-line string, one number per line.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: Elements are reordered by swapping adjacent pairs.
  - type: correspondence
    description: The element at input index `2k` moves to output index `2k+1`.
  - type: correspondence
    description: The element at input index `2k+1` moves to output index `2k`.
  - type: condition
    description: If the length of input_sequence is odd, the element at the last index `n-1` remains at the relative end position in the output_sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input string and parse it into a list of integers, maintaining the original order.
2.  Initialize an empty list to store the output sequence.
3.  Iterate through the input list using an index that increments by 2 in each step (e.g., 0, 2, 4...).
4.  In each iteration, check if there is a next element (i.e., if the current index + 1 is within the bounds of the input list).
5.  If a next element exists:
    *   Take the element at the current index and the element at the next index (index + 1) as a pair.
    *   Append the element from the next index (index + 1) to the output list first.
    *   Then, append the element from the current index to the output list.
6.  If a next element does *not* exist (this happens only when the list has an odd number of elements and the loop is at the last element):
    *   Append the element at the current index (the last element) directly to the output list.
7.  After iterating through the entire input list, convert the output list back into a multi-line string format, with each number on a new line.
8.  Return the formatted string.
