def transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
    """
    Transforms the input sequence by swapping adjacent pairs of numbers.
    The input is expected as a list of lists (grid), where each inner list
    contains a single number, representing a single column format derived
    from a multi-line string input where each line has one number.
    The transformation logic operates on the sequence formed by these numbers.
    Adjacent pairs (index 0 & 1, 2 & 3, etc.) are swapped in the sequence.
    If the sequence has an odd number of elements, the last element remains
    in its relative position after all preceding pairs are swapped.
    The output is returned in the same single-column grid format.
