objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list
    description: A sequence of single-digit numbers derived from the input string, one number per line.
    properties:
      - order: significant
      - element_type: integer (single digit)
      - length: variable (denoted as 'n')
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list
    description: A sequence containing the same numbers as the input_sequence but potentially reordered.
    properties:
      - order: significant
      - element_type: integer (single digit)
      - length: same as input_sequence ('n')
  - name: first_pair
    type: tuple
    description: The elements at index 0 and index 1 of the input_sequence. Relevant if n >= 2.
  - name: last_pair
    type: tuple
    description: The elements at index n-2 and index n-1 of the input_sequence. Relevant if n >= 4.
  - name: middle_elements
    type: list
    description: Elements between the first_pair and last_pair (indices 2 to n-3). These remain in their original positions relative to each other.

actions:
  - name: parse_input
    description: Convert the multi-line input string into a list of integers.
  - name: check_length
    description: Determine the length 'n' of the input_sequence.
  - name: copy_sequence
    description: Create a mutable copy of the input_sequence to store the transformations.
  - name: swap_first_pair
    description: If n >= 2, swap the elements at index 0 and 1 in the copied sequence.
  - name: swap_last_pair
    description: If n >= 4, swap the elements at index n-2 and n-1 in the copied sequence.
  - name: format_output
    description: Convert the transformed sequence back into a multi-line string, one number per line.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The first two elements are swapped, and the last two elements are swapped. Middle elements remain in place.
  - type: conditional_swap
    description: Elements at input indices 0 and 1 are swapped if n >= 2.
  - type: conditional_swap
    description: Elements at input indices n-2 and n-1 are swapped if n >= 4.
  - type: identity
    description: Elements at input indices k (where 2 <= k <= n-3) map directly to output index k.
