## train_1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0
0 5 6 0
0 8 3 0
0 0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
5 0 0 6
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
8 0 0 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0
0 3 4 0
0 7 6 0
0 0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
3 0 0 4
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
7 0 0 6
```

Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Input and Output Structure:** Both input and output are represented as 4x4 grids containing single-digit integers.
2.  **Input Pattern:** The non-zero numbers in the input grids are consistently located within the central 2x2 subgrid (rows 1 and 2, columns 1 and 2, using 0-based indexing). The border cells (row 0, row 3, column 0, column 3) are always zero.
3.  **Output Pattern:** The non-zero numbers in the output grids are located at the four corners (positions (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3)). All other cells in the output grid are zero.
4.  **Value Preservation:** The non-zero numerical values themselves are preserved from the input to the output. Their positions change.
5.  **Positional Mapping:** There's a clear mapping from the positions within the central 2x2 input subgrid to the corner positions in the output grid:
    *   The value at input `(1, 1)` moves to output `(0, 0)`.
    *   The value at input `(1, 2)` moves to output `(0, 3)`.
    *   The value at input `(2, 1)` moves to output `(3, 0)`.
    *   The value at input `(2, 2)` moves to output `(3, 3)`.

    type: grid
    properties:
      - rows: 4
      - columns: 4
      - cells: contain single-digit integers
      - structure: non-zero values located only at the four corners (indices (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3)); all other cells are zero.
  - name: central_subgrid
    type: subgrid
    location: extracted from input_grid at rows 1-2 and columns 1-2
    properties:
      - contains the four non-zero values from the input_grid
relationships:
  - type: mapping
    from: central_subgrid elements
    to: output_grid corner elements
    details:
      - input_grid[1][1] maps to output_grid[0][0]
      - input_grid[1][2] maps to output_grid[0][3]
      - input_grid[2][1] maps to output_grid[3][0]
      - input_grid[2][2] maps to output_grid[3][3]
actions:
  - name: identify_central_values
    actor: transformation process
    object: input_grid
    result: extracts the four values from the central 2x2 subgrid.
  - name: initialize_output
    actor: transformation process
    result: creates a 4x4 grid filled entirely with zeros.
  - name: place_values_in_corners
    actor: transformation process
    object: output_grid
    details: places the extracted central values into the corresponding corner positions of the initialized output grid based on the defined mapping.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize a new 4x4 output grid, filling all cells with the value 0.
2.  Identify the four values located in the central 2x2 subgrid of the input grid (at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2)).
3.  Place the value from input grid position (1,1) into the output grid position (0,0).
4.  Place the value from input grid position (1,2) into the output grid position (0,3).
5.  Place the value from input grid position (2,1) into the output grid position (3,0).
6.  Place the value from input grid position (2,2) into the output grid position (3,3).
7.  The resulting output grid is the final output.
