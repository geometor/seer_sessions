The grid dimensions vary across examples (4x4, 3x3, 5x5).\n    *   The output is consistently a 2x2 grid of single-digit integers.\n    *   The output grid appears to be a subgrid extracted from the input grid.\n    *   The specific 2x2 subgrid selected seems to depend on the dimensions of the input grid. In examples 2 and 3 (3x3 and 5x5 inputs), the output is the top-left 2x2 corner. In example 1 (4x4 input), the output is the 2x2 subgrid formed by the first two rows and the last two columns.\n\n*   **Facts YAML:**\n    "
