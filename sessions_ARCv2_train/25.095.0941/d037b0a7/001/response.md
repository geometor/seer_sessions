```python
import numpy as np
import copy

"""
Repeatedly iterate through the input grid, propagating non-zero values downwards into zero cells. 
Specifically, if a cell at (r, c) is 0 and the cell directly above it at (r-1, c) is non-zero, 
the cell at (r, c) takes the value of the cell above it. 
This process repeats until a full pass over the grid results in no changes.
