Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input:** The input is consistently a 3x3 grid containing integers. The integers observed are only 0 and 2.
2.  **Output:** The output is always a single integer, either 1 or 7.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation rule appears to depend on the spatial arrangement of the '2's within the 3x3 grid. There seems to be a specific property of the grid pattern that determines whether the output is 1 or 7.
4.  **Pattern Analysis:**
    *   Inputs resulting in output '1' (`train_1`, `train_5`, `train_6`) all exhibit vertical symmetry. That is, the first column is identical to the third column.
    *   Inputs resulting in output '7' (`train_2`, `train_3`, `train_4`) do *not* exhibit this vertical symmetry. The first column differs from the third column.
5.  **Hypothesis:** The core logic seems to be a check for vertical symmetry within the input grid. If the grid is vertically symmetrical (column 0 equals column 2), the output is 1; otherwise, the output is 7.

## Facts


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D list (3x3) of integers
    properties:
      - cells: contain values 0 or 2
      - columns: three distinct vertical columns (indexed 0, 1, 2)
      - rows: three distinct horizontal rows (indexed 0, 1, 2)
      - vertical_symmetry: a boolean property indicating if column 0 is identical to column 2
  - name: output_value
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: can be 1 or 7

relationships:
  - type: determines
    subject: input_grid's vertical_symmetry property
    object: output_value's value
    rule: If vertical_symmetry is true, output_value is 1, otherwise it is 7.

actions:
  - name: check_vertical_symmetry
    input: input_grid
    steps:
      - Compare the elements of column 0 with the corresponding elements of column 2.
      - Return true if all corresponding elements are equal, false otherwise.
  - name: determine_output
    input: result of check_vertical_symmetry
    steps:
      - If the result is true, set output_value to 1.
      - If the result is false, set output_value to 7.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the 3x3 input grid.
2.  Extract the first column (column index 0) and the third column (column index 2).
3.  Compare the first column element by element with the third column.
4.  If the first column is identical to the third column (i.e., `grid[0][0] == grid[0][2]`, `grid[1][0] == grid[1][2]`, and `grid[2][0] == grid[2][2]`), then output the integer `1`.
5.  Otherwise (if the columns are not identical), output the integer `7`.
