            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe code implementing the \"extract bottom-right subgrid\" hypothesis correctly solved Example 1 but failed Examples 2 and 3. This confirms that simple positional rules are insufficient for this task.\n\nPrevious attempts focused on finding the *most* frequent subgrid, potentially with tie-breakers. However, Example 1's output ('8') is less frequent than '6', and Example 3's output (`[[5,5],[5,2]]`) is less frequent than several other 2x2 grids. This strongly suggests that maximizing frequency is not the primary goal, or at least not the only one.\n\nThe tie-breaking scenario in Example 2 also remains unresolved by simple positional or sum-based rules.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Acknowledge Failure:** The core logic based on maximizing frequency and simple positional/value tie-breakers seems flawed for this task. Hypotheses like \"earliest/latest occurrence\", \"min/max sum of coordinates\", \"min/max sum of elements\", \"bottom-right corner\" do not work across all examples.\n2.  **Reconsider Significance:** Instead of just frequency, perhaps the *significance* of a pattern matters. How could significance be measured? Maybe related to minimizing errors if the input grid were tiled by the pattern (as hinted by Ex 1)? Or related to the pattern's structure or symmetry?\n3.  **Complex Tie-breaking:** If frequency *is* involved, the tie-breaker must be more complex than previously tested, potentially involving the spatial distribution of occurrences or relationships between the tied patterns.\n4.  **Path Forward:** Given the persistent failures of common pattern-finding heuristics, a correct solution is not obvious. The \"Pattern Completion / Noise Reduction\" idea derived from Example 1 seems the most plausible direction but requires a more sophisticated implementation (defining \"best pattern\", \"mismatch\", and the selection rule based on mismatches). Since this is complex to formulate without more examples or insights, we will revert to documenting the \"most frequent + latest occurrence\" hypothesis, explicitly stating its known limitations based on the test results, as it represents a structured (though incorrect) approach.\n\n**Metrics Analysis**\n\nCode execution is not required. Manual analysis and previous execution results have sufficiently demonstrated the failure of the \"bottom-right corner\" hypothesis for Examples 2 and 3.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
