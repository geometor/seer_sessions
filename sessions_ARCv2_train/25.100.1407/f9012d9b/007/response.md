"""
Identify the subgrid pattern that appears most frequently in the input grid, matching a predetermined output size (1x1 for 4x4 inputs, 2x2 for 5x5 or 7x7 inputs). If multiple patterns share the highest frequency, select the pattern whose last occurrence (maximum row index, then maximum column index) is latest in the grid. Note: This rule is known to fail on the provided training examples but represents a standard frequency-based approach.
