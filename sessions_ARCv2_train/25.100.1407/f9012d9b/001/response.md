Identify the subgrid pattern that appears most frequently in the input grid, matching a predetermined output size (1x1 for 4x4 inputs, 2x2 for 5x5 or 7x7 inputs). If multiple patterns share the highest frequency, select the pattern whose first occurrence (minimum row index, then minimum column index) is earliest in the grid.
