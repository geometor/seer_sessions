The rule must incorporate other factors or use a different tie-breaking mechanism. Example 3, in particular, suggests that strict maximum frequency might not even be required.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Re-analyze the relationship between the most frequent subgrids and the actual target output in each example using detailed metrics.\n2.  Focus on the tie-breaking scenario in Example 2 to find a rule that selects the correct subgrid.\n3.  Investigate why Examples 1 and 3 deviate from the \"most frequent\" principle.\n4.  Formulate a new hypothesis that attempts to reconcile these observations, possibly involving different tie-breaking criteria or considering factors beyond frequency and simple position.\n\n**Metrics Analysis (Code Execution Results)**\n\n"
