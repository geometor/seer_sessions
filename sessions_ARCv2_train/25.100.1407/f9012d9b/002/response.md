**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous attempt using the "most frequent subgrid + earliest occurrence tie-breaker" failed on all three training examples.
*   Example 1 failed because the output ('8') was not the most frequent digit ('6').
*   Example 2 failed the tie-breaker; the code picked the grid with the earliest occurrence, but the target grid occurred later.
*   Example 3 failed because the output grid (`[[5,5],[5,2]]`) was not among the most frequent (frequency 3 vs max frequency 4).

This indicates that simple frequency combined with simple positional tie-breakers (earliest/latest) is not the correct logic. The rule must incorporate other factors or use a different tie-breaking mechanism. Example 3, in particular, suggests that strict maximum frequency might not even be required.

**Strategy:**
1.  Re-analyze the relationship between the most frequent subgrids and the actual target output in each example using detailed metrics.
2.  Focus on the tie-breaking scenario in Example 2 to find a rule that selects the correct subgrid.
3.  Investigate why Examples 1 and 3 deviate from the "most frequent" principle.
4.  Formulate a new hypothesis that attempts to reconcile these observations, possibly involving different tie-breaking criteria or considering factors beyond frequency and simple position.

**Metrics Analysis (Code Execution Results)**


```python
# tool_code
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter, defaultdict

# Helper function (assuming it's available/defined as in previous steps)
def get_subgrids_with_locations(grid: np.ndarray, height: int, width: int) -> list[tuple[tuple[tuple[int, ...]], tuple[int, int]]]:
    """Extracts subgrids and their top-left coordinates."""
    subgrids = []
    grid_height, grid_width = grid.shape
    if height <= 0 or width <= 0
