task_description: Find a specific subgrid within a larger input grid and output it.
input_properties:
  - type: grid
  - elements: single digits (0-9)
  - size: variable (e.g., 4x4, 5x5, 7x7 observed)
output_properties:
  - type: grid
  - elements: single digits (0-9)
  - size: smaller than input (e.g., 1x1, 2x2 observed)
  - relationship_to_input: appears to be a subgrid extracted based on complex criteria.
observations:
  - output_size_correlation: Output size seems correlated with input size (4x4->1x1, 5x5->2x2, 7x7->2x2).
  - frequency_inconsistency: The output grid is NOT always the most frequent subgrid of its size in the input (fails Ex1, Ex3).
  - tie_breaker_inconsistency: Simple positional tie-breakers (earliest/latest occurrence) for most frequent subgrids do NOT consistently select the target output (fails Ex2).
  - pattern_completion_hypothesis: Example 1 suggests a potential rule involving finding a best-fit tiling pattern, identifying errors/mismatches, and using the pattern's expected value at the mismatch location.
  - specific_location_hypothesis: Example 1 target '8' is at corners (0,0) and (3,3). Bottom-right corner element works for Ex1 but fails Ex2, Ex3.
failed_hypotheses:
  - Most frequent subgrid.
  - Most frequent subgrid + earliest occurrence tie-breaker.
  - Most frequent subgrid + latest occurrence tie-breaker.
  - Most frequent subgrid + min/max sum of coordinates tie-breaker.
  - Subgrid at top-left corner.
  - Subgrid at bottom-right corner (works Ex1 only).
