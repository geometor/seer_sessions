The maximum frequency is 4, achieved by five different 2x2 subgrids. The target output `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` only occurs 3 times (e.g., at (2,2)).\n    *   This completely invalidates the hypothesis: \"Find the most frequent subgrid matching the output dimensions, use tie-breaking if necessary\".\n\n*   **Re-evaluating the Task:** There must be a different relationship.\n    *   Could it be related to noise or errors? In example 1, the grid is almost perfectly tiled by `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]`, except for one cell (0 at (0,2)). The output is 8.\n    *   In example 3, the grid is almost tiled by `[[2, 2, 5], [2, 2, 5], [5, 5, 5]]` if you ignore the last two columns/rows. The output is `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`.\n    *   Maybe the task is about finding the largest \"almost\" repeating pattern and extracting something from it?\n\n*   **Hypothesis: Pattern Completion / Noise Reduction:**\n    *   **Example 1:** Input 4x4, Output 1x1. The grid is mostly composed of `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]`. The single '0' seems like an error. If we assume the most frequent 2x2 pattern is the \"true\" underlying pattern, that's `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]`. How do we get the 1x1 output '8' from this? Maybe the most frequent element *within* the most frequent pattern? Here, 8 and 6 both appear twice. Tie-breaking? Top-left element? That's 8. Matches output.\n    *   **Example 3:** Input 7x7, Output 2x2. Can we find a dominant repeating pattern? The top-left 5x5 seems highly repetitive with 2s and 5s. The last two rows/columns introduce 0s and look different.\n        *   Consider 3x3 blocks:\n            *   `[[2, 2, 5], [2, 2, 5], [5, 5, 5]]` occurs at (0,0), (0,3), (1,0), (1,3).

No obvious connection.\n    *   This \"dominant pattern based on divisors\" idea doesn't seem to work either.\n\n*   **Final Hypothesis Attempt:** The process involves finding the subgrid W (matching output dimensions) that maximizes a score. The score is based on how \"well\" the input grid can be explained by repetitions of W, potentially allowing for some noise/mismatches. The subgrid W with the highest score is the output.\n    *   How to define \"well explained\"? Maybe minimize the number of cells *not* covered by an instance of W? Or minimize the number of mismatched cells if tiled? The tiling idea failed earlier.\n    *   Let's go back to the \"most frequent subgrid matching output dimensions\" idea, but reconsider the tie-breaking. What haven't we tried?\n    *   Maybe the tie-breaker involves the sum of elements? (Failed in Ex 2).\n    *   Maybe the tie-breaker involves the sum of the *coordinates* of its occurrences?\n        *   **Ex 2:** Freq=3 for A, B, C, D.\n            *   A occurs at (0,0), (0,2), (2,2). Sum of coords = (0+0)+(0+2)+(2+2) = 0+2+4 = 6.\n            *   B occurs at (0,1), (0,3), (2,3). Sum of coords = (0+1)+(0+3)+(2+3) = 1+3+5 = 9.\n            *   C occurs at (1,0), (1,2), (3,2). Sum of coords = (1+0)+(1+2)+(3+2) = 1+3+5 = 9.\n            *   D occurs at (1,1), (1,3), (3,3). Sum of coords = (1+1)+(1+3)+(3+3) = 2+4+6 = 12.\n            *   Lowest sum is 6 (A). Highest sum is 12 (D). Middle sums are 9 (B, C). Output is C. How to break tie between B and C?\n                *   Use previous tie-breakers on B and C: Last occurrence? C(3,2) > B(2,3). Select C. MATCHES!\n                *   Let's test this combined rule.\n\n    *   **Combined Hypothesis:**\n        1. Find all unique subgrids W matching the output dimensions.\n        2. Count the frequency of each W.\n        3. Identify the maximum frequency F_max.\n        4. Select all subgrids W_max that have frequency F_max.\n        5. If only one W_max exists, that is the output.\n        6. If multiple W_max exist, calculate a tie-breaking score for each W_max: Sum of (r+c) for all top-left occurrence coordinates (r, c).\n        7. Select all subgrids W_tie1 that have the minimum tie-breaking score.\n        8. If only one W_tie1 exists, that is the output.\n        9. If multiple W_tie1 exist, apply a second tie-breaker: Select the subgrid W_tie2 whose last occurrence (max r, then max c) is maximal among W_tie1. This W_tie2 is the output.\n\n    *   **Test on Example 1:**\n        1. Output 1x1. Subgrids are digits.\n        2. Freq: 6 (9), 8 (6), 0 (1).\n        3. F_max = 9.\n        4. W_max = {6}.\n        5. Only one W_max. Output should be 6. Actual output is 8. FAIL.\n\n    *   **Test on Example 3:**\n        1. Output 2x2.\n        2. Freq: Max freq F_max = 4.\n        3. W_max = { `[[2,2],[2,2]]`, `[[2,5],[2,5]]`, `[[5,2],[5,2]]`, `[[2,2],[5,5]]`, `[[5,5],[2,2]]` }.\n        4. Calculate tie-breaker score (sum of r+c for occurrences):\n            *   `[[2,2],[2,2]]`: (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3) -> Sums: 0, 3, 3, 6. Total = 12.\n            *   `[[2,5],[2,5]]`: (0,1), (0,4), (3,1), (3,4) -> Sums: 1, 4, 4, 7. Total = 16.\n            *   `[[5,2],[5,2]]`: (0,2), (0,5), (3,2), (3,5) -> Sums: 2, 5, 5, 8. Total = 20.\n            *   `[[2,2],[5,5]]`: (1,0), (1,3), (4,0), (4,3) -> Sums: 1, 4, 4, 7. Total = 16.\n            *   `[[5,5],[2,2]]`: (2,0), (2,3), (5,0), (5,3) -> Sums: 2, 5, 5, 8. Total = 20.\n        5. Minimum score is 12 for `[[2, 2], [2, 2]]`.\n        6. W_tie1 = { `[[2, 2], [2, 2]]` }.\n        7. Only one W_tie1. Output should be `[[2, 2], [2, 2]]`. Actual output is `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`. FAIL.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The relationship is not simply the most frequent subgrid with tie-breaking rules based on position or sum of coordinates. The examples seem deliberately constructed to break simple frequency/position rules. Example 1 outputting 8 when 6 is most frequent is key. Example 3 outputting a grid that occurs less frequently than others is also key.\n\n*   Let's reconsider the \"noise reduction\" or \"pattern completion\" idea. What if the algorithm tries to find the \"simplest\" grid (composed of repeating blocks) that is \"closest\" to the input?\n    *   Ex 1: Input `[[8,6,0,6],[6,8,6,8],[8,6,8,6],[6,8,6,8]]`. Output 8. A grid of all 8s has 10 differences. A grid of all 6s has 7 differences. A grid tiled by `[[8,6],[6,8]]` (i.e., `[[8,6,8,6],[6,8,6,8],[8,6,8,6],[6,8,6,8]]`) has 1 difference (the 0). This seems the \"closest\" simple pattern. How to get 8 from the pattern `[[8,6],[6,8]]`? Top-left?\n    *   Ex 3: Input 7x7. Output `[[5,5],[5,2]]`. Can we tile the 7x7 grid with `[[5,5],[5,2]]` somehow to minimize differences? This seems complex.\n\n*   **Focus on Example 1 again.** Input 4x4, Output 8. Why 8?\n    *   It's present in 3/4 corners.\n    *   It's present in 3/4 center 2x2 cells.\n    *   It's the top-left element of the most frequent 2x2 subgrid.\n    *   It's the element at (0,0).\n    *   It's the element at (3,3).\n    *   Let's assume the rule is: Find the most frequent 2x2 subgrid. Output its top-left element.\n        *   Ex 1: Most frequent 2x2 is `[[8,6],[6,8]]`. Top-left is 8. Matches Output 8 (1x1).\n        *   Ex 2: Most frequent 2x2s are A, B, C, D (freq 3). Tie. How to break tie? If we use the \"lowest sum of coords\" tie-breaker, we get A=`[[2,1],[1,1]]`. If we use the \"last occurrence\" tie-breaker, we get D=`[[1,1],[1,2]]`. If we take the top-left element of A, we get 2. If we take the top-left of D, we get 1. Neither matches the output `[[1,1],[2,1]]`. This hypothesis fails too.\n\n*   **Final Final Hypothesis:** Find the subgrid W, with the same dimensions as the output, that appears **most frequently** in the input grid. If there are multiple subgrids with the same highest frequency, choose the one that appears **last** in the input grid (scan row by row, then column by column, find the highest row index, then highest column index for the top-left corner).\n    *   **Ex 1:** Output 1x1. Find most frequent digit. It's '6' (9 times). '8' is 6 times. Output should be 6. Actual=8. FAIL.\n    *   **Ex 2:** Output 2x2. Find most frequent 2x2. Tie between A, B, C, D (freq 3). Last occurrences: A(2,2), B(2,3), C(3,2), D(3,3). Choose D based on last occurrence (3,3). Output is D=`[[1,1],[1,2]]`. Actual=C=`[[1,1],[2,1]]`. FAIL.\n    *   **Ex 3:** Output 2x2. Find most frequent 2x2. Tie between 5 grids (freq 4). Last occurrences: `... [[5,5],[2,2]]` at (5,3). Choose `[[5,5],[2,2]]`. Actual=`[[5,5],[5,2]]`. FAIL.\n\nIt seems my analysis methods (frequency, position tie-breakers) are insufficient. There must be a different logic. Perhaps related to symmetry, specific locations (center, corners), or a transformation based on neighboring cells? Given the constraints, I will propose the \"most frequent subgrid + last occurrence tie-breaker\" as it was derived logically, even though it failed on the examples. It's possible there's an error in my manual application or calculation, or the examples have a more complex rule. Let's trust the calculation for Ex 3.\n\nRecalculating Ex 2 tie-breaker:\nMost frequent (3): A, B, C, D.\nLast Occurrences: A(2,2), B(2,3), C(3,2), D(3,3).\nMax (r,c) is (3,3), corresponding to D = `[[1,1],[1,2]]`. Output is C=`[[1,1],[2,1]]`. This hypothesis is definitely wrong for Ex 2.\n\nMaybe the tie-breaker is lowest row, then lowest column (first occurrence)?\nEx 2: First Occurrences: A(0,0), B(0,1), C(1,0), D(1,1). Min (r,c) is (0,0), corresponding to A = `[[2,1],[1,1]]`. Output is C. Wrong again.\n\nLet's try the hypothesis from the ARC tutorial: Find the subgrid W (size of output) that minimizes the number of different subgrids of that size.\nEx 2: 5x5 input, 2x2 output. Total 4x4=16 subgrids.\nUnique subgrids we found: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H (8 unique subgrids).\nIf the output was A, it covers positions (0,0), (0,2), (2,2). 3 covered. 13 remain.\nIf the output was C = `[[1,1],[2,1]]`, it occurs at (1,0), (1,2), (3,2).\nThis doesn't seem right either.\n\nLet's assume the hypothesis: **Find the subgrid W (dimensions of output) that occurs most frequently. Use the subgrid that appears earliest (minimum row, then minimum column) as a tie-breaker.**\nEx 1: Most frequent digit '6'. Occurs first at (0,1). Output=8. FAIL.\nEx 2: Most frequent 2x2 A,B,C,D. Earliest is A at (0,0). Output=C. FAIL.\nEx 3: Most frequent 2x2 `[[2,2],[2,2]]` etc. Earliest is `[[2,2],[2,2]]` at (0,0). Output=`[[5,5],[5,2]]`. FAIL.\n\nOkay, I am unable to find a consistent rule based on frequency and simple positional tie-breakers. The examples contradict these simple hypotheses. The most likely rule involves finding the most frequent sub-pattern matching the output size, but the tie-breaking rule is non-obvious (not first/last occurrence, not smallest/largest sum, not lexicographical).\n\nGiven the failure of standard approaches, let's propose the most frequent + earliest occurrence tie-breaker as a guess, acknowledging its failure on the test cases, as it's a common pattern.Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Data:** The input is a grid (matrix) of single-digit integers. The grid sizes vary across examples (4x4, 5x5, 7x7).\n2.  **Output Data:** The output is also a grid of single-digit integers, but significantly smaller than the input (1x1, 2x2, 2x2). The output seems to be a sub-pattern or a summary derived from the input.\n3.  **Transformation Goal:** The core task appears to be identifying a specific subgrid within the input grid based on some criteria and presenting that subgrid as the output. The criteria likely involve finding recurring patterns.\n\n**Analysis & Hypothesis Development:**\n\n*   A common approach in such tasks is to look for repeating subgrids within the input. The size of the subgrid to look for seems to match the dimensions of the output grid.\n*   **Hypothesis:** The output grid is the subgrid of the same dimensions that appears most frequently within the input grid.\n*   **Testing Hypothesis:**\n    *   **Example 1 (Input 4x4, Output 1x1):** We look for the most frequent 1x1 subgrid (digit). Counts: 6 (9 times), 8 (6 times), 0 (1 time). The most frequent is '6'. The output is '8'. This contradicts the simple frequency hypothesis.\n    *   **Example 2 (Input 5x5, Output 2x2):** We look for the most frequent 2x2 subgrid. Calculation shows four subgrids (`[[2,1],[1,1]]`, `[[1,2],[1,1]]`, `[[1,1],[2,1]]`, `[[1,1],[1,2]]`) appear with the maximum frequency (3 times). The output is `[[1,1],[2,1]]`, which is one of these four. This suggests frequency is involved, but a tie-breaking rule is needed.\n    *   **Example 3 (Input 7x7, Output 2x2):** We look for the most frequent 2x2 subgrid. Calculation shows five subgrids appear with the maximum frequency (4 times). The output `[[5,5],[5,2]]` appears only 3 times, less than the maximum frequency. This contradicts the frequency hypothesis again.\n\n*   **Revised Thinking:** The most frequent subgrid hypothesis (even with tie-breakers) doesn't consistently fit all examples. Example 1 and Example 3 are particularly problematic for this rule. Example 1 selects a less frequent digit, and Example 3 selects a subgrid that isn't the most frequent. There might be a more complex pattern recognition involved, possibly related to noise reduction, pattern completion, or selecting a pattern based on its location or properties beyond simple frequency.\n\n*   **Alternative Hypothesis (Positional):** Maybe the output is simply the subgrid located at a specific position (e.g., top-left, bottom-right)?\n    *   Top-left: Ex1->8 (match), Ex2->`[[2,1],[1,1]]` (no match), Ex3->`[[2,2],[2,2]]` (no match).\n    *   Bottom-right: Ex1->8 (match), Ex2->`[[1,1],[1,2]]` (no match), Ex3->`[[0,0],[0,0]]` (no match). This also fails.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Analysis:** A simple, universally applicable rule based on frequency or fixed position isn't immediately apparent. The examples seem designed to challenge these straightforward approaches. However, the core idea likely revolves around identifying a representative or significant subgrid"
