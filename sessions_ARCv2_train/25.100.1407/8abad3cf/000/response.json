The key is to select the right input rows, identify columns based on content within those rows, potentially rearrange/select elements from those columns, and assemble them (with repetition/padding) into the output grid.\n\n*   **Final Logic Formulation:**\n    1.  Determine the relevant slice of the input grid (a subset of rows).\n        *   T1: Rows 1-4. (Output height is 4).\n        *   T2: Rows 3-5. (Output height is 3).\n        *   Rule: Find rows containing the least frequent non-background digit(s). Take these rows and potentially some adjacent rows (like the one above the first target row if it's monochromatic?). Or maybe just take a fixed number of rows (H_out) starting from the row containing the first instance of the rarest digit? Or starting from row 1? Needs clarification, but for now, assume rows 1 to H_out for T1 and rows 3 to 3+H_out-1 for T2. Let's assume the slice height is fixed for the task (4 for T1, 3 for T2). For T1, the slice is rows 1-4. For T2, the slice is rows 3-5.\n    2.  Identify \"key\" digits within this slice:\n        *   The most frequent digit (MFD). (T1: 7, T2: 7)\n        *   The second most frequent digit (SMFD). (T1: 4, T2: N/A within slice?)\n        *   The \"unique\" or least frequent digit(s) (LFD). (T1: 1, 5; T2: 6)\n    3.  Identify representative columns within the slice:\n        *   `C_MFD`: A column containing only MFD. (T1: Col 5 -> [7,7,7,7], T2: Col 0 -> [7,7,7])\n        *   `C_SMFD`: A column containing only SMFD. (T1: Col 0 -> [4,4,4,4], T2: N/A)\n        *   `C_LFD1`: Column containing the primary LFD. (T1: Col 2 -> [7,1,7,4], T2: Col 1 -> [7,6,6])\n        *   `C_LFD2`: Column containing another LFD (if applicable). (T1: Col 6 -> [5,5,7,5], T2: N/A)\n    4.  Determine the \"padding\" digit (PD) if needed. (T2: 9). This seems to be a digit present prominently outside the chosen slice.\n    5.  Determine the output dimensions (H_out, W_out). H_out is the slice height. W_out seems fixed (10 for T1, 6 for T2).\n    6.  Construct the output columns using elements from the representative input columns (C_MFD, C_SMFD, C_LFD1, C_LFD2) and potentially the padding digit (PD). The exact construction involves specific indexing and repetition rules derived from the examples.\n        *   T1: Columns 0-9 constructed using C7, C4, C1, C5 based on specific index combinations and repetition.\n        *   T2: Columns 0-5 constructed using C7, C6, and C9 (padding column `[9,9,9]`) based on specific index combinations and repetition.\n\n*   **Structuring the Output:**\n    *   Perception: Input is a grid, output is a grid with different dimensions. The transformation involves selecting a horizontal slice of the input, identifying columns within that slice based on the digits they contain, and rearranging/selecting elements from those columns, potentially padding/repeating them, to form the columns of the output grid.\n    *   Facts (YAML): Focus on objects (grid, slice, columns, digits), properties (dimensions, frequency, location, values), and actions (select slice, identify digits, find columns, extract elements, rearrange, repeat, construct output).\n    *   Natural Language Program: Describe the steps outlined in \"Final Logic Formulation\".## Perception\n\nThe user provided two examples (`train_1`, `train_2`) of a task transforming an input grid of digits into an output grid of digits.\n\n1.  **Grid Transformation:** The core task is transforming an input grid into an output grid.\n2.  **Dimension Change:** The dimensions (height and width) of the grid change between input and output.\n    *   `train_1`: 7x7 input -> 4x10 output\n    *   `train_2`: 7x4 input -> 3x6 output\n3.  **Content Preservation/Rearrangement:** The digits present in the output grid are also present in the input grid, but they are significantly rearranged. New digits do not appear to be introduced, except potentially through a padding mechanism determined by the input.\n4.  **Slice Selection:** The transformation seems to focus on a specific horizontal slice (subset of rows) from the input grid. The height of the output grid corresponds to the height of this slice.\n    *   `train_1`: Output height is 4. The relevant input slice appears to be rows 1-4.\n    *   `train_2`: Output height is 3. The relevant input slice appears to be rows 3-5.\n5.  **Column Identification:** Within the selected input slice, specific columns are identified based on the digits they contain. Key columns seem to be those containing:\n    *   Only the most frequent digit within the slice.\n    *   Only the second most frequent digit within the slice (if applicable).\n    *   A unique or rare digit within the slice.\n6.  **Output Construction:** The output grid is constructed column by column. Each output column is derived from:\n    *   Elements of the identified input columns (potentially rearranged or selected based on index).\n    *   Repetition of previously constructed columns.\n    *   Potentially padding with a digit determined from the input (often a digit prominent outside the selected slice).\n7.  **Key Digits:** The process relies on identifying digits based on their frequency or uniqueness within the selected input slice.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
