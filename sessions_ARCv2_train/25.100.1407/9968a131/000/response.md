Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids (matrices) of single-digit integers.
*   **Dimensions:** The dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the output grid are identical to the input grid.
*   **Row-Based Transformation:** The changes seem to occur independently within specific rows. Comparing input and output grids, some rows are identical, while others are modified.
*   **Index Dependency:** The modification appears to depend on the row's position (index).
    *   In `train_1` (4x4 grid), rows 0 and 2 (even indices) are unchanged. Rows 1 and 3 (odd indices) are modified.
    *   In `train_2` (6x6 grid), rows 0, 2, and 4 (even indices) are unchanged. Rows 1, 3, and 5 (odd indices) are modified.
*   **Modification Pattern:** Let's examine the modified rows (odd indices):
    *   `train_1`, Row 1: Input `7 8 3 7` becomes Output `7 7 8 3`. This is a cyclic right shift of the row elements (`7` moves from last to first, `7`->`7`, `8`->`8`, `3`->`3`).
    *   `train_1`, Row 3: Input `7 8 3 7` becomes Output `7 7 8 3`. Same cyclic right shift.
    *   `train_2`, Row 1: Input `5 0 7 7 7 7` becomes Output `7 5 0 7 7 7`. This is also a cyclic right shift (`7` moves from last to first, `5`->`5`, `0`->`0`, etc.).
    *   `train_2`, Rows 3 & 5: Same pattern as Row 1.
*   **Consistent Rule:** The rule seems consistent: Even-indexed rows (0, 2, 4...) are copied directly from input to output. Odd-indexed rows (1, 3, 5...) undergo a cyclic right shift of their elements.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation

Input:
  type: grid
  content: integers

Output:
  type: grid
  content: integers
  properties:
    - same_dimensions_as_input

Objects:
  - name: grid_row
    properties:
      - index: integer (0-based)
      - elements: list of integers
      - index_parity: derived (even or odd)

Relationships:
  - output_grid_row depends_on input_grid_row
  - transformation_rule depends_on grid_row.index_parity

Actions:
  - name: process_grid
    steps:
      - iterate through each input_grid_row with its index
      - check index_parity
      - if index_parity is even:
          action: copy_row_to_output
      - if index_parity is odd:
          action: apply_cyclic_right_shift
          target: input_grid_row.elements
          result: transformed_row_elements
          action: place_transformed_row_in_output

Transformations:
  - name: copy_row_to_output
    input: input_grid_row
    output: output_grid_row (identical to input)
  - name: apply_cyclic_right_shift
    input: list_of_elements
    output: new_list_of_elements
    description: The last element becomes the first element, and all preceding elements shift one position to the right. (e.g., [a, b, c, d] becomes [d, a, b, c])
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the row index (starting from 0).
3.  For each row:
    a.  Check if the row index is even (0, 2, 4, ...).
    b.  If the index is even, copy the input row directly to the corresponding row in the output grid.
    c.  If the index is odd (1, 3, 5, ...), perform a cyclic right shift on the elements of the input row: move the last element to the first position and shift all other elements one position to the right. Place this modified row into the corresponding row of the output grid.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
