            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids (matrices) of single-digit integers.\n*   **Dimensions:** The dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the output grid are identical to the input grid.\n*   **Row-Based Transformation:** The changes seem to occur independently within specific rows. Comparing input and output grids, some rows are identical, while others are modified.\n*   **Index Dependency:** The modification appears to depend on the row's position (index).\n    *   In `train_1` (4x4 grid), rows 0 and 2 (even indices) are unchanged. Rows 1 and 3 (odd indices) are modified.\n    *   In `train_2` (6x6 grid), rows 0, 2, and 4 (even indices) are unchanged. Rows 1, 3, and 5 (odd indices) are modified.\n*   **Modification Pattern:** Let's examine the modified rows (odd indices):\n    *   `train_1`, Row 1: Input `7 8 3 7` becomes Output `7 7 8 3`. This is a cyclic right shift of the row elements (`7` moves from last to first, `7`->`7`, `8`->`8`, `3`->`3`).\n    *   `train_1`, Row 3: Input `7 8 3 7` becomes Output `7 7 8 3`. Same cyclic right shift.\n    *   `train_2`, Row 1: Input `5 0 7 7 7 7` becomes Output `7 5 0 7 7 7`. This is also a cyclic right shift (`7` moves from last to first, `5`->`5`, `0`->`0`, etc.).\n    *   `train_2`, Rows 3 & 5: Same pattern as Row 1.\n*   **Consistent Rule:** The rule seems consistent: Even-indexed rows (0, 2, 4...) are copied directly from input to output. Odd-indexed rows (1, 3, 5...) undergo a cyclic right shift of their elements.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
