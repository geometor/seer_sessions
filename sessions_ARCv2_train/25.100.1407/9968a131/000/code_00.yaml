Task: Grid Transformation

Input:
  type: grid
  content: integers

Output:
  type: grid
  content: integers
  properties:
    - same_dimensions_as_input

Objects:
  - name: grid_row
    properties:
      - index: integer (0-based)
      - elements: list of integers
      - index_parity: derived (even or odd)

Relationships:
  - output_grid_row depends_on input_grid_row
  - transformation_rule depends_on grid_row.index_parity

Actions:
  - name: process_grid
    steps:
      - iterate through each input_grid_row with its index
      - check index_parity
      - if index_parity is even:
          action: copy_row_to_output
      - if index_parity is odd:
          action: apply_cyclic_right_shift
          target: input_grid_row.elements
          result: transformed_row_elements
          action: place_transformed_row_in_output

Transformations:
  - name: copy_row_to_output
    input: input_grid_row
    output: output_grid_row (identical to input)
  - name: apply_cyclic_right_shift
    input: list_of_elements
    output: new_list_of_elements
    description: The last element becomes the first element, and all preceding elements shift one position to the right. (e.g., [a, b, c, d] becomes [d, a, b, c])
