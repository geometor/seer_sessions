"""
Transforms an input grid based on analysis of its 2x2 subgrids (patterns).

The process involves:
1.  Identify all unique 2x2 patterns, their frequencies, and the sum of their elements.
2.  Find the maximum sum (MaxS) among all patterns.
3.  Filter to keep only patterns with sum = MaxS.
4.  Among these, find the maximum frequency (MaxF).
5.  Filter again to keep only patterns with sum = MaxS and frequency = MaxF.
6.  If exactly one pattern remains, output a 1x1 grid containing its top-left element.
7.  If multiple patterns remain (a tie), select one using a tie-breaking rule:
    Maximize the bottom-left element, then the top-right, then the top-left.
    Output the selected 2x2 pattern.
