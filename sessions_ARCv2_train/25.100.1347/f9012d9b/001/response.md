```python
"""
Transforms an input grid based on the analysis of its 2x2 subgrids (patterns).

The process involves:
1. Identifying all unique 2x2 patterns and their frequencies.
2. Calculating the sum of elements for each unique pattern.
3. Selecting patterns with the maximum sum.
4. Among those, selecting patterns with the maximum frequency.
5. If a unique pattern remains, output its top-left element.
6. If multiple patterns remain (tie), output the pattern selected by a specific tie-breaking rule (lexicographically largest flattened pattern used as a placeholder, though known to be imperfect for provided examples).
