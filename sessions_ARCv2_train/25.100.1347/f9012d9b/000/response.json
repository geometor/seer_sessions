            "text": "The code execution reveals the following:\n\n*   **train_1:** The most frequent 2x2 pattern is `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]`. The output is `8`. This *could* be the top-left element of the most frequent pattern.\n*   **train_2:** The code output shows the lexicographically smallest among the most frequent patterns is `[[1, 1], [1, 2]]`. However, the expected output is `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`. My manual calculation identified `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` as the lexicographically smallest. Let me re-check the manual sorting:\n    *   P1: [2, 1, 1, 1]\n    *   P2: [1, 2, 1, 1]\n    *   P3: [1, 1, 2, 1]\n    *   P4: [1, 1, 1, 2]\n    Comparing P3 and P4: [1, 1, 2, 1] vs [1, 1, 1, 2]. The third element determines the order: 2 > 1, so P4 is smaller.\n    The code is correct: `[[1, 1], [1, 2]]` (P4) is lexicographically smaller than `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` (P3).\n    So, the hypothesis that the output is the lexicographically smallest most frequent 2x2 pattern is incorrect for train_2. The output for train_2 is `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` (P3). Why P3?\n\n*   **train_3:** The code identifies 5 patterns tied for the most frequent (4 times). The lexicographically smallest is `[[2, 2], [2, 2]]`. The expected output is `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`. The hypothesis is incorrect for train_3 as well.\n\n**Let's reconsider the tie-breaking mechanism.**\nMaybe the tie isn't broken by lexicographical order. How else could `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` be chosen in train_2?\nThe tied patterns were:\n*   `P1 = [[2, 1], [1, 1]]`\n*   `P2 = [[1, 2], [1, 1]]`\n*   `P3 = [[1, 1], [2, 1]]` (Output)\n*   `P4 = [[1, 1], [1, 2]]`\nTheir first occurrences:\n*   P1: (0,0)\n*   P2: (0,1)\n*   P3: (1,0) -> Row 1, Col 0\n*   P4: (1,1)\nWhat if the tie is broken by the location of the *first* occurrence, selecting the pattern whose first occurrence has the smallest row index, and then the smallest column index?\n*   Row 0: P1 (0,0), P2 (0,1)\n*   Row 1: P3 (1,0), P4 (1,1)\nThe patterns starting in Row 0 are P1 and P2. Between these, P1 at (0,0) comes first. If this rule were used, the output would be P1 `[[2, 1], [1, 1]]`. Still doesn't match train_2's output `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`.\n\n**Revisiting train_1:**\nInput: 4x4, Output: 8.\nMost frequent 2x2 is `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]`. How to get 8? Top-left?\nIf the output *size* is determined by something else? What if the task involves identifying a specific N x N pattern (not necessarily 2x2) that repeats most often?\nAnd what if the output format changes? In train_1, it's a single number; in train_2 and train_3, it's a 2x2 grid.\n\n**Hypothesis 2: Output is the most frequent NxN pattern, N=2**\n*   **train_1:** Most frequent 2x2 is `P1 = [[8, 6], [6, 8]]`. Output is `8`. How is `8` derived? Maybe the output is the top-left element *only if* the most frequent pattern is unique?\n*   **train_2:** Tied most frequent 2x2 patterns. Output is `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`. This is one of the tied patterns (P3). Why P3? Not lexicographically smallest, not first occurrence. What's special about P3?\n*   **train_3:** Tied most frequent 2x2 patterns. Output is `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`. This output pattern doesn't even appear in the list of most frequent patterns calculated by the code. Let me manually check if `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` exists and how often.\n    "

Matches.\n*   **train_2:** Tied most frequent patterns (P1, P2, P3, P4). Output is `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` (P3). This rule requires a tie-breaker to select P3. What could it be? Not lexicographical smallest, not first occurrence. Maybe based on the sum of elements (all are 5)? Maybe based on position of *last* occurrence?\n    *   P1 last: (2,2) `[[2, 1], [1, 1]]`\n    *   P2 last: (2,3) `[[1, 2], [1, 1]]`\n    *   P3 last: (3,2) `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` -> Latest occurrence?\n    *   P4 last: (3,3) `[[1, 1], [1, 2]]`\n    P4 occurs last.

Matches.\n*   **train_2:**\n    P1 `[[2, 1], [1, 1]]` Sum=5 (Freq 3)\n    P2 `[[1, 2], [1, 1]]` Sum=5 (Freq 3)\n    P3 `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` Sum=5 (Freq 3)\n    P4 `[[1, 1], [1, 2]]` Sum=5 (Freq 3)\n    `[[2, 1], [0, 0]]` Sum=3 (Freq 1)\n    `[[1, 2], [0, 1]]` Sum=4 (Freq 1)\n    `[[1, 1], [1, 1]]` Sum=4 (Freq 1)\n    `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]` Sum=0 (Freq 1)\n    `[[0, 1], [0, 2]]` Sum=3 (Freq 1)\n    Highest sum is 5. Patterns P1, P2, P3, P4 all have sum 5 and frequency 3. They are tied for highest sum AND highest frequency. Tie-breaker needed for P3 `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`. Let's try the \"smallest row, then smallest col index of first occurrence\" tie-breaker again.\n    P1 (0,0), P2 (0,1), P3 (1,0), P4 (1,1). P1 occurs first. This would select P1 `[[2, 1], [1, 1]]`. Doesn't match output P3.\n    What if the tie-breaker is lexicographical smallest among the tied patterns?\n    P1: [2, 1, 1, 1]\n    P2: [1, 2, 1, 1]\n    P3: [1, 1, 2, 1]\n    P4: [1, 1, 1, 2] -> Smallest\n    This selects P4 `[[1, 1], [1, 2]]`. Doesn't match output P3.\n*   **train_3:**\n    Patterns with freq 4:\n    `[[2, 2], [2, 2]]` Sum=8\n    `[[2, 5], [2, 5]]` Sum=14\n    `[[5, 2], [5, 2]]` Sum=14\n    `[[2, 2], [5, 5]]` Sum=14\n    `[[5, 5], [2, 2]]` Sum=14\n    Patterns with freq 3:\n    `[[2, 5], [5, 5]]` Sum=17\n    `[[5, 2], [5, 5]]` Sum=17\n    `[[5, 5], [2, 5]]` Sum=17\n    `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` Sum=17 -> Output Pattern!\n    Highest sum is 17. All patterns with sum 17 have frequency 3.\n    Rule: Find all 2x2 patterns. Select the one(s) with the maximum sum. Among these, select the one(s) with the maximum frequency. If there is a unique pattern remaining, output its top-left element (like train_1, although sum wasn't strictly needed there). If ties remain (like train_2, train_3), output the pattern itself, using a tie-breaker.\n    Let's refine for train_1: Max sum is 28 (P1, P4). Max freq among these is 4 (P1). Unique pattern P1 remains. Output top-left `8`. Matches.\n    Let's refine for train_2: Max sum is 5 (P1, P2, P3, P4). Max freq among these is 3 (all of them). Tied patterns remain (P1, P2, P3, P4). Output the pattern itself. Tie-breaker needed for P3 `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`.\n    Let's refine for train_3: Max sum is 17. Patterns with sum 17 are `[[2, 5], [5, 5]]`, `[[5, 2], [5, 5]]`, `[[5, 5], [2, 5]]`, `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`. Max frequency among these is 3 (all of them). Tied patterns remain. Output the pattern itself. Tie-breaker needed for `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`.\n\n    What is the tie-breaker? It selects P3 in train_2 and `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` in train_3.\n    Train_2 Tied Patterns (Sum 5, Freq 3):\n    P1=`[[2, 1], [1, 1]]` @ (0,0) First Occ\n    P2=`[[1, 2], [1, 1]]` @ (0,1)\n    P3=`[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` @ (1,0) -> Output\n    P4=`[[1, 1], [1, 2]]` @ (1,1)\n    Train_3 Tied Patterns (Sum 17, Freq 3):\n    Pa=`[[2, 5], [5, 5]]` @ (1,1) First Occ\n    Pb=`[[5, 2], [5, 5]]` @ (1,4)\n    Pc=`[[5, 5], [2, 5]]` @ (2,1)\n    Pd=`[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` @ (2,4) -> Output\n    Let's check first occurrences carefully for T3.\n    Pa @ (1,1), (1,4), (4,1) -> First (1,1)\n    Pb @ (1,4) -> No, (1,4) is `[[2, 5], [5, 5]]` (Pa). Pb=`[[5, 2], [5, 5]]` occurs at (2,4) and (4,4). First (2,4).\n    Pc=`[[5, 5], [2, 5]]` occurs at (2,1), (2,4), (5,1). First (2,1).\n    Pd=`[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` occurs at (2,4), (5,3). First (2,4).\n\n    Tie-breaker is not first occurrence (P1 in T2, Pa in T3).\n    Tie-breaker is not lexicographical smallest (P4 in T2, Pa `[2, 5, 5, 5]` in T3).\n    Tie-breaker is not last occurrence?\n    T2 Last: P1(2,2), P2(2,3), P3(3,2), P4(3,3) -> P4 chosen. No.\n    T3 Last: Pa(4,1), Pb(4,4), Pc(5,1), Pd(5,3) -> Pc chosen. No.\n\n    Could the tie-breaker be the pattern that occurs at the location (row, col) that has the largest row index, then the largest col index amongst the first occurrences?\n    T2 First Occurrences: P1(0,0), P2(0,1), P3(1,0), P4(1,1). Max row is 1 (P3, P4). Max col among these is 1 (P4). Selects P4. No.\n\n    Could the tie-breaker be the pattern whose *first occurrence* position (r, c) yields the maximum value of r * grid_width + c?\n    T2: width=5. P1(0,0)->0. P2(0,1)->1. P3(1,0)->5. P4(1,1)->6. Selects P4. No.\n\n    This is tricky. The selection rule for ties is elusive. But the overall approach seems promising:\n    1. Find all unique 2x2 subpatterns and their frequencies.\n    2. Calculate the sum of elements for each unique pattern.\n    3. Find the maximum sum (max_S).\n    4. Filter patterns to keep only those with sum = max_S.\n    5. Find the maximum frequency (max_F) among the filtered patterns.\n    6. Filter again to keep only patterns with sum = max_S AND frequency = max_F.\n    7. If a unique pattern remains, output its top-left element.\n    8. If multiple patterns remain (tie), output the selected pattern itself based on an unknown tie-breaking rule.\n\n    The unknown tie-breaker selected P3 `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` in T2 and Pd `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` in T3 from their respective tied sets.\n    T2 Tied Set: {P1, P2, P3, P4}\n    T3 Tied Set: {Pa, Pb, Pc, Pd}\n\n    What distinguishes P3 and Pd?\n    P3: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`\n    Pd: `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`\n\n    Maybe the tie-breaker involves comparing the patterns directly, like finding the one that is lexicographically largest?\n    T2: P1[2,1,1,1], P2[1,2,1,1], P3[1,1,2,1], P4[1,1,1,2]. Largest is P1. No.\n    T3: Pa[2,5,5,5], Pb[5,2,5,5], Pc[5,5,2,5], Pd[5,5,5,2]. Largest is Pd. Yes!\n\n    **Hypothesis 6 (Refined):**\n    1. Find all unique 2x2 subpatterns and their frequencies.\n    2. Calculate the sum of elements for each unique pattern.\n    3. Find the maximum sum (max_S).\n    4. Filter patterns to keep only those with sum = max_S.\n    5. Find the maximum frequency (max_F) among the filtered patterns.\n    6. Filter again to keep only patterns with sum = max_S AND frequency = max_F.\n    7. If a unique pattern remains, output its top-left element.\n    8. If multiple patterns remain (tie), flatten each pattern row-wise and select the one that is lexicographically largest. Output this selected pattern.\n\n    Let's test:\n    *   **train_1:** Max sum=28 (P1, P4). Max freq among these=4 (P1). Unique pattern P1 remains. Output top-left `8`. Matches.\n    *   **train_2:** Tied patterns {P1, P2, P3, P4}. Flatten: P1[2,1,1,1], P2[1,2,1,1], P3[1,1,2,1], P4[1,1,1,2]. Lexicographically largest is P1 `[[2, 1], [1, 1]]`. Output should be `[[2, 1], [1, 1]]`. But the example output is `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` (P3). Hypothesis fails.\n\n    Maybe lexicographically smallest tie-breaker? Selects P4. No.\n\n    I am stuck on the tie-breaker. Let's assume the selection process (max sum, then max freq) is correct and describe it. The tie-breaker remains unclear.\n\n    Let's assume the examples are correct and the rule is \"select P3\" in T2 and \"select Pd\" in T3. Is there *any* common property?\n\n    P3: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`\n    Pd: `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`\n\n    Maybe compare based on the diagonal elements? Or anti-diagonal?\n    P3: diag=(1,1), anti=(1,2)\n    Pd: diag=(5,2), anti=(5,5)\n\n    Consider the tied sets again.\n    T2: P1=`[[2, 1], [1, 1]]`, P2=`[[1, 2], [1, 1]]`, P3=`[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`, P4=`[[1, 1], [1, 2]]`\n    T3: Pa=`[[2, 5], [5, 5]]`, Pb=`[[5, 2], [5, 5]]`, Pc=`[[5, 5], [2, 5]]`, Pd=`[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`\n\n    What if the tie-breaker uses the first occurrence location? Select the pattern whose first occurrence (r,c) minimizes c (column index), and then minimizes r (row index)?\n    T2 First Occ: P1(0,0), P2(0,1), P3(1,0), P4(1,1). Min col is 0 (P1, P3). Min row among these is 0 (P1). Selects P1. No.\n\n    Maximize c, then maximize r?\n    T2 First Occ: P1(0,0), P2(0,1), P3(1,0), P4(1,1). Max col is 1 (P2, P4). Max row among these is 1 (P4). Selects P4. No.\n\n    Maximize r, then maximize c? (This was tested before - selects P4). No.\n    Minimize r, then minimize c? (This was tested before - selects P1). No.\n\n    Let's stick to the general idea: find the 2x2 pattern(s) that are maximal according to some criteria (sum, frequency). If unique result -> top-left. If multiple results -> output the pattern based on some tie-breaker. The exact criteria (max sum -> max freq) and the tie-breaker are the core issues. But this frame seems the most plausible.## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Input Data:** The input is a rectangular grid (matrix) of single-digit non-negative integers. The grid dimensions vary across examples.\n2.  **Output Data:** The output is either a single integer (train_1) or a smaller rectangular grid of integers (train_2, train_3 - specifically 2x2).\n3.  **Core Task:** The task seems to involve identifying a specific 2x2 pattern within the input grid based on certain criteria and then deriving the output from that pattern.\n4.  **Key Transformation:** The transformation involves scanning the input grid for all possible 2x2 subgrids (patterns), evaluating these patterns based on properties like frequency of occurrence and sum of elements, and selecting a final pattern or element.\n5.  **Pattern Identification:** The process appears to prioritize patterns based on the sum of their elements (selecting the maximum sum) and then their frequency (selecting the maximum frequency among those with the maximum sum).\n6.  **Output Determination:**\n    *   If the selection process yields a *unique* 2x2 pattern, the output seems to be the top-left element of that pattern (as seen in train_1).\n    *   If the selection process results in a *tie* (multiple patterns satisfy the criteria), the output is one of the tied 2x2 patterns itself (as seen in train_2 and train_3).\n7.  **Tie-breaking:** A specific, currently unidentified, rule is used to select *which* pattern to output when a tie occurs after considering sum and frequency. Common tie-breakers like lexicographical order (smallest or largest) or position of first/last occurrence do not consistently explain the selection in the provided examples.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
