Input:
  type: grid
  description: A rectangular grid of single-digit integers (0-9).
  properties:
    - rows: integer
    - columns: integer
    - elements: integer digits

Output:
  type: grid or integer
  description: Either a single integer or a small grid of integers.
  properties:
    - case_single: Represents a single element derived from the input.
    - case_grid: Represents a 2x2 subgrid derived from the input.

Transformation:
  action: analyze_subgrids
  object: 2x2 subgrids (patterns) within the input grid.
  steps:
    - identify: Find all unique 2x2 patterns and their frequency.
    - calculate: Compute the sum of elements for each unique 2x2 pattern.
    - filter_sum: Select pattern(s) with the maximum sum.
    - filter_frequency: Among selected patterns, select pattern(s) with the maximum frequency.
  decision_point:
    condition: Number of patterns remaining after filtering.
    branches:
      - if_unique:
          action: extract_element
          source: The unique remaining 2x2 pattern.
          element: Top-left corner.
          result: Single integer output.
      - if_multiple:
          action: tie_break
          source: The set of tied 2x2 patterns.
          rule: An undetermined tie-breaking rule selects one pattern.
          result: 2x2 grid output (the selected pattern).

Relationships:
  - Input grid contains multiple overlapping 2x2 subgrids.
  - Each 2x2 subgrid has properties: frequency, sum of elements.
  - The output is derived from the 2x2 subgrid(s) that maximize sum, then frequency.
  - Output format (single element vs. 2x2 grid) depends on whether the selection process yields a unique pattern or a tie.
