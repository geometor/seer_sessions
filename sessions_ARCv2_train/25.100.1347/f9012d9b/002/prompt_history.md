Selected pattern for train_2: [[np.int64(1), np.int64(1)], [np.int64(1), np.int64(2)]]

```
The code execution reveals the following:

*   **train_1:** The most frequent 2x2 pattern is `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]`. The output is `8`. This *could* be the top-left element of the most frequent pattern.
*   **train_2:** The code output shows the lexicographically smallest among the most frequent patterns is `[[1, 1], [1, 2]]`. However, the expected output is `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`. My manual calculation identified `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` as the lexicographically smallest. Let me re-check the manual sorting:
    *   P1: [2, 1, 1, 1]
    *   P2: [1, 2, 1, 1]
    *   P3: [1, 1, 2, 1]
    *   P4: [1, 1, 1, 2]
    Comparing P3 and P4: [1, 1, 2, 1] vs [1, 1, 1, 2]. The third element determines the order: 2 > 1, so P4 is smaller.
    The code is correct: `[[1, 1], [1, 2]]` (P4) is lexicographically smaller than `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` (P3).
    So, the hypothesis that the output is the lexicographically smallest most frequent 2x2 pattern is incorrect for train_2. The output for train_2 is `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` (P3). Why P3?

*   **train_3:** The code identifies 5 patterns tied for the most frequent (4 times). The lexicographically smallest is `[[2, 2], [2, 2]]`. The expected output is `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`. The hypothesis is incorrect for train_3 as well.

**Let's reconsider the tie-breaking mechanism.**
Maybe the tie isn't broken by lexicographical order. How else could `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` be chosen in train_2?
The tied patterns were:
*   `P1 = [[2, 1], [1, 1]]`
*   `P2 = [[1, 2], [1, 1]]`
*   `P3 = [[1, 1], [2, 1]]` (Output)
*   `P4 = [[1, 1], [1, 2]]`
Their first occurrences:
*   P1: (0,0)
*   P2: (0,1)
*   P3: (1,0) -> Row 1, Col 0
*   P4: (1,1)
What if the tie is broken by the location of the *first* occurrence, selecting the pattern whose first occurrence has the smallest row index, and then the smallest column index?
*   Row 0: P1 (0,0), P2 (0,1)
*   Row 1: P3 (1,0), P4 (1,1)
The patterns starting in Row 0 are P1 and P2. Between these, P1 at (0,0) comes first. If this rule were used, the output would be P1 `[[2, 1], [1, 1]]`. Still doesn't match train_2's output `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`.

**Revisiting train_1:**
Input: 4x4, Output: 8.
Most frequent 2x2 is `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]`. How to get 8? Top-left?
If the output *size* is determined by something else? What if the task involves identifying a specific N x N pattern (not necessarily 2x2) that repeats most often?
And what if the output format changes? In train_1, it's a single number; in train_2 and train_3, it's a 2x2 grid.

**Hypothesis 2: Output is the most frequent NxN pattern, N=2**
*   **train_1:** Most frequent 2x2 is `P1 = [[8, 6], [6, 8]]`. Output is `8`. How is `8` derived? Maybe the output is the top-left element *only if* the most frequent pattern is unique?
*   **train_2:** Tied most frequent 2x2 patterns. Output is `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`. This is one of the tied patterns (P3). Why P3? Not lexicographically smallest, not first occurrence. What's special about P3?
*   **train_3:** Tied most frequent 2x2 patterns. Output is `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`. This output pattern doesn't even appear in the list of most frequent patterns calculated by the code. Let me manually check if `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` exists and how often.
    
```
    2 2 5 2 2 5 2
    2 2 5 2 2 5 2
    5 5 5 5 5 5 5
    2 2 5 2 2 5 2
    2 2 5 2 2 5 2
    5 5 5 5 5 0 0
    2 2 5 2 2 0 0
    ```

    *   (2,1): `[[5, 5], [2, 5]]`
    *   (2,4): `[[5, 5], [2, 5]]`
    *   (5,0): `[[5, 5], [2, 2]]`
    *   (5,3): `[[5, 5], [2, 2]]`
    The pattern `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` does not appear in the input grid.

**This invalidates the "most frequent 2x2 subgrid" hypothesis completely.**

**Let's step back.**
Maybe the process involves finding *all* distinct 2x2 patterns, and then doing something with them?

*   **train_1:** Patterns: `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]`, `[[0, 6], [6, 8]]`, `[[6, 8], [8, 6]]`, `[[6, 8], [6, 8]]`, `[[8, 6], [8, 6]]`.
*   **train_2:** Patterns: `[[2, 1], [1, 1]]`, `[[1, 2], [1, 1]]`, `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`, `[[1, 1], [1, 2]]`, `[[2, 1], [0, 0]]`, `[[1, 2], [0, 1]]`, `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`, `[[0, 1], [0, 2]]`, `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`, `[[1, 1], [1, 1]]` (appears at (2,2), (3,2)). Oh, wait, my manual listing missed one. `[[1, 1], [1, 1]]` occurs once.
*   **train_3:** Many patterns.

What if the operation is finding the 2x2 pattern that is "maximally different" or "minimally different" from its neighbors? Or a pattern located at a specific position?

Could the task be about finding the 2x2 subgrid that is "most unique" based on its content compared to other 2x2 subgrids?

Let's reconsider train_1: Output is 8.
Input:

```
8 6 0 6
6 8 6 8
8 6 8 6
6 8 6 8
```

Subgrids:
`[[8, 6], [6, 8]]` (x3)
`[[0, 6], [6, 8]]` (x1)
`[[6, 8], [8, 6]]` (x2 - at (1,0) and (1,2))
`[[8, 6], [6, 8]]` (x3)
`[[6, 8], [6, 8]]` (x1 - at (0,1))
`[[8, 6], [8, 6]]` (x1 - at (2,1))
`[[6, 8], [6, 8]]` (x1 - at (0,1), (1,1), (3,1)) -> appears 3 times
`[[8, 6], [8, 6]]` (x1 - at (2,1))
Let's recalculate frequencies carefully.
(0,0): `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]` = P1
(0,1): `[[6, 0], [8, 6]]` = P2 -> No, `[[6, 0], [8, 6]]` -> wait, `[[6, 0], [8, 6]]` doesn't exist. It's `[[6, 0], [8, 6]]`. Ah, `[[6, 0], [8, 6]]` is wrong. `[[6, 0], [8, 6]]` is not a subgrid. Indices must be consecutive.
(0,1): `[[6, 0], [8, 6]]` -> no. Position (0,1) is `[[6, 0], [8, 6]]`. No, `[[6, 0], [8, 6]]`. No, `[[6, 0], [8, 6]]`. It's `[[6, 0], [8, 6]]`. Ok, the grid is:
`8 6 0 6`
`6 8 6 8`
`8 6 8 6`
`6 8 6 8`
(0,0): `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]` - P1
(0,1): `[[6, 0], [8, 6]]` - P2
(0,2): `[[0, 6], [6, 8]]` - P3
(1,0): `[[6, 8], [8, 6]]` - P4
(1,1): `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]` - P1
(1,2): `[[6, 8], [8, 6]]` - P4
(2,0): `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]` - P1
(2,1): `[[6, 8], [8, 6]]` - P4 -> No, (2,1) is `[[6, 8], [8, 6]]`. Wait. `[[6, 8], [8, 6]]` again? No. `[[6, 8], [8, 6]]`. Check row 2, col 1: `[[6, 8], [8, 6]]`. No, grid[2][1] is 6, grid[2][2] is 8, grid[3][1] is 8, grid[3][2] is 6. So (2,1) is `[[6, 8], [8, 6]]`. P4 again.
(2,2): `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]` - P1 -> No, (2,2) is `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]`. Yes, P1 again.

Frequencies:
P1: `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]` - 4 times ((0,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2)) -> wait, (2,0) is `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]`, (2,2) is `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]`. Let's use the code result.
Code for train_1: `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]` is most frequent. (Code should be correct).
How is 8 derived from `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]`? Top-left? Sum? Max? Most frequent element within the pattern (8)?

**Hypothesis 3: Find the most frequent 2x2 pattern. If unique, output its top-left element. If tied, output the pattern itself (using some tie-breaker).**

*   **train_1:** Most frequent is `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]` (unique). Output top-left: `8`. Matches.
*   **train_2:** Tied most frequent patterns (P1, P2, P3, P4). Output is `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` (P3). This rule requires a tie-breaker to select P3. What could it be? Not lexicographical smallest, not first occurrence. Maybe based on the sum of elements (all are 5)? Maybe based on position of *last* occurrence?
    *   P1 last: (2,2) `[[2, 1], [1, 1]]`
    *   P2 last: (2,3) `[[1, 2], [1, 1]]`
    *   P3 last: (3,2) `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` -> Latest occurrence?
    *   P4 last: (3,3) `[[1, 1], [1, 2]]`
    P4 occurs last. Doesn't work.

Let's look at the numbers themselves. Maybe 0 has a special meaning (background?).
In train_3, the output `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` contains 5 and 2. The input grid is dominated by 2 and 5.
What if we look at the 3x3 neighbourhood?
Or perhaps the pattern size isn't fixed at 2x2?

Consider patterns of other sizes.
*   **train_1:** Output 8. Any single number most frequent? 6 is (8 times), 8 is (7 times), 0 is (1 time). Doesn't help.
*   **train_2:** Output `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`. Numbers 1, 2. Input has 0, 1, 2.
*   **train_3:** Output `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`. Numbers 5, 2. Input has 0, 2, 5.

**Hypothesis 4: Find the most frequent *non-background* number (assuming 0 is background). Extract a pattern related to it.** This doesn't work for train_1 (6 is most frequent, output is 8).

**Let's reconsider train_3:**
Input:

```
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
5 5 5 5 5 5 5
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
5 5 5 5 5 0 0
2 2 5 2 2 0 0
```

Output:

```
5 5
5 2
```

Could the output be related to a specific location? Center? Corners? No obvious relation.
What if the output pattern is constructed, not extracted?

Imagine sliding a 2x2 window. For each position, calculate some property. Find the position where this property is maximized/minimized. Then extract the 2x2 grid at that location?
What property? Sum? Number of unique elements? Frequency of elements?

Let's look at the output patterns again:
`8`
`[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`
`[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`

Is there a relationship *between* the examples? No, likely independent transformations.

**Hypothesis 5: Find the most frequent 3x3 pattern?**
*   **train_1:** 4x4 grid. Only four 3x3 patterns.
    *   Top-left: `[[8, 6, 0], [6, 8, 6], [8, 6, 8]]`
    *   Top-right: `[[6, 0, 6], [8, 6, 8], [6, 8, 6]]`
    *   Bottom-left: `[[6, 8, 6], [8, 6, 8], [6, 8, 6]]`
    *   Bottom-right: `[[8, 6, 8], [6, 8, 6], [8, 6, 8]]`
    None repeat. Doesn't seem helpful.

What if we look for the largest "solid" rectangle of the most frequent non-zero number?
*   **train_1:** Most frequent non-zero is 6. Largest rectangle of 6s? Just individual cells. Second most frequent is 8. Largest rectangle of 8s? Just individual cells.
*   **train_2:** Most frequent non-zero is 1 (13 times). Largest rectangle of 1s? A 1x5 row `1 1 1 1 1` at row 1. Also a 2x2 block `[[1, 1], [1, 1]]` at (2,2).
*   **train_3:** Most frequent non-zero is 2 (20 times). Second is 5 (19 times). Largest rectangle of 2s? Several 2x2 blocks `[[2, 2], [2, 2]]`. Largest rectangle of 5s? A 1x7 row `5 5 5 5 5 5 5` at row 2. Also a 3x1 column `[[5], [5], [5]]` at col 2. Also `[[5, 5], [5, 5]]` at (5,0), (5,3).

This doesn't lead directly to the outputs.

Let's return to **Hypothesis 3**: Find the most frequent 2x2 pattern. If unique, output its top-left element. If tied, output the pattern itself (using some tie-breaker).

*   **train_1:** Unique most frequent `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]`. Output top-left `8`. Matches.
*   **train_2:** Tied most frequent (P1, P2, P3, P4). Output `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` (P3). Tie-breaker needed.
*   **train_3:** Tied most frequent (5 patterns, including `[[2, 2], [2, 2]]`, `[[2, 5], [2, 5]]`, etc.). Output `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`. This output is not one of the most frequent patterns. Hypothesis 3 fails here.

What if the output is always the 2x2 pattern, but for train_1 the pattern is `[[8]]`? No, that doesn't make sense.

Maybe the concept of "most frequent" needs refinement. Weighted by position? Only consider patterns not containing 0?

Let's analyze the structure/patterns again.
*   **train_1:** Looks like a checkerboard attempt with errors (0).
*   **train_2:** Row of 1s, columns alternate 2/1 somewhat. Ends with 0s.
*   **train_3:** Rows/columns of 2s and 5s. Row of 5s. Ends with 0s.

Could the task be to find the "dominant" 2x2 pattern *excluding* a specific background color (maybe 0, maybe the most frequent color overall)?

Let's try finding the most frequent 2x2 pattern *excluding* those containing 0.
*   **train_1:** Input does contain 0. Pattern P3 `[[0, 6], [6, 8]]` contains 0. Pattern P2 `[[6, 0], [8, 6]]` contains 0.
    Patterns without 0: P1 `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]` (4 times), P4 `[[6, 8], [8, 6]]` (2 times).
    Most frequent non-zero pattern is P1. Unique. Rule: Output top-left. -> 8. Matches.
*   **train_2:** Input contains 0.
    Patterns containing 0: `[[2, 1], [0, 0]]`, `[[1, 2], [0, 1]]`, `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`, `[[0, 1], [0, 2]]`. Frequencies are 1 each.
    Patterns without 0: P1, P2, P3, P4 (all freq 3), `[[1, 1], [1, 1]]` (freq 1), `[[2,1],[1,1]]` (freq 3), `[[1,2],[1,1]]` (freq 3), `[[1,1],[2,1]]` (freq 3), `[[1,1],[1,2]]` (freq 3), `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`(freq 3), `[[1,1],[1,1]]` (freq 1).
    The tied most frequent patterns (P1, P2, P3, P4) do not contain 0. Frequency is 3.
    Rule: Tie occurs. Output the pattern itself. Need tie-breaker for P3 `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`.
*   **train_3:** Input contains 0.
    Patterns containing 0: `[[5, 5], [5, 0]]`, `[[5, 5], [0, 0]]`, `[[2, 5], [5, 0]]`, `[[5, 0], [2, 0]]`, `[[5, 0], [0, 0]]`, `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`, `[[2, 2], [0, 0]]`, `[[2, 0], [2, 0]]`, `[[5, 2], [0, 0]]`. Frequencies are 1 each.
    Most frequent patterns overall had freq 4. Let's check if they contain 0.
    `((2, 2), (2, 2))` - No 0. Freq 4.
    `((2, 5), (2, 5))` - No 0. Freq 4.
    `((5, 2), (5, 2))` - No 0. Freq 4.
    `((2, 2), (5, 5))` - No 0. Freq 4.
    `((5, 5), (2, 2))` - No 0. Freq 4.
    All 5 tied most frequent patterns have frequency 4 and do not contain 0.
    Rule: Tie occurs. Output the pattern itself. Need tie-breaker for `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`. But this pattern is NOT one of the tied most frequent ones! Its frequency must be lower than 4. Let's find its frequency.

    print(f"Frequency of {target_pattern}: {count}")
```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
Frequency of ((5, 5), (5, 2)): 3

```
Okay, the output pattern `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` only occurs 3 times. The maximum frequency is 4. This hypothesis is still incorrect for train_3.

**Final attempt: What if the output relates to the pattern that has the *maximum sum*?**
*   **train_1:**
    P1 `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]` Sum=28 (Freq 4)
    P2 `[[6, 0], [8, 6]]` Sum=20 (Freq 1)
    P3 `[[0, 6], [6, 8]]` Sum=20 (Freq 1)
    P4 `[[6, 8], [8, 6]]` Sum=28 (Freq 2)
    Highest sum is 28, associated with P1 and P4. P1 is more frequent. If we select the most frequent pattern among those with the highest sum, it's P1. Output top-left -> 8. Matches.
*   **train_2:**
    P1 `[[2, 1], [1, 1]]` Sum=5 (Freq 3)
    P2 `[[1, 2], [1, 1]]` Sum=5 (Freq 3)
    P3 `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` Sum=5 (Freq 3)
    P4 `[[1, 1], [1, 2]]` Sum=5 (Freq 3)
    `[[2, 1], [0, 0]]` Sum=3 (Freq 1)
    `[[1, 2], [0, 1]]` Sum=4 (Freq 1)
    `[[1, 1], [1, 1]]` Sum=4 (Freq 1)
    `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]` Sum=0 (Freq 1)
    `[[0, 1], [0, 2]]` Sum=3 (Freq 1)
    Highest sum is 5. Patterns P1, P2, P3, P4 all have sum 5 and frequency 3. They are tied for highest sum AND highest frequency. Tie-breaker needed for P3 `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`. Let's try the "smallest row, then smallest col index of first occurrence" tie-breaker again.
    P1 (0,0), P2 (0,1), P3 (1,0), P4 (1,1). P1 occurs first. This would select P1 `[[2, 1], [1, 1]]`. Doesn't match output P3.
    What if the tie-breaker is lexicographical smallest among the tied patterns?
    P1: [2, 1, 1, 1]
    P2: [1, 2, 1, 1]
    P3: [1, 1, 2, 1]
    P4: [1, 1, 1, 2] -> Smallest
    This selects P4 `[[1, 1], [1, 2]]`. Doesn't match output P3.
*   **train_3:**
    Patterns with freq 4:
    `[[2, 2], [2, 2]]` Sum=8
    `[[2, 5], [2, 5]]` Sum=14
    `[[5, 2], [5, 2]]` Sum=14
    `[[2, 2], [5, 5]]` Sum=14
    `[[5, 5], [2, 2]]` Sum=14
    Patterns with freq 3:
    `[[2, 5], [5, 5]]` Sum=17
    `[[5, 2], [5, 5]]` Sum=17
    `[[5, 5], [2, 5]]` Sum=17
    `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` Sum=17 -> Output Pattern!
    Highest sum is 17. All patterns with sum 17 have frequency 3.
    Rule: Find all 2x2 patterns. Select the one(s) with the maximum sum. Among these, select the one(s) with the maximum frequency. If there is a unique pattern remaining, output its top-left element (like train_1, although sum wasn't strictly needed there). If ties remain (like train_2, train_3), output the pattern itself, using a tie-breaker.
    Let's refine for train_1: Max sum is 28 (P1, P4). Max freq among these is 4 (P1). Unique pattern P1 remains. Output top-left `8`. Matches.
    Let's refine for train_2: Max sum is 5 (P1, P2, P3, P4). Max freq among these is 3 (all of them). Tied patterns remain (P1, P2, P3, P4). Output the pattern itself. Tie-breaker needed for P3 `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`.
    Let's refine for train_3: Max sum is 17. Patterns with sum 17 are `[[2, 5], [5, 5]]`, `[[5, 2], [5, 5]]`, `[[5, 5], [2, 5]]`, `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`. Max frequency among these is 3 (all of them). Tied patterns remain. Output the pattern itself. Tie-breaker needed for `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`.

    What is the tie-breaker? It selects P3 in train_2 and `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` in train_3.
    Train_2 Tied Patterns (Sum 5, Freq 3):
    P1=`[[2, 1], [1, 1]]` @ (0,0) First Occ
    P2=`[[1, 2], [1, 1]]` @ (0,1)
    P3=`[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` @ (1,0) -> Output
    P4=`[[1, 1], [1, 2]]` @ (1,1)
    Train_3 Tied Patterns (Sum 17, Freq 3):
    Pa=`[[2, 5], [5, 5]]` @ (1,1) First Occ
    Pb=`[[5, 2], [5, 5]]` @ (1,4)
    Pc=`[[5, 5], [2, 5]]` @ (2,1)
    Pd=`[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` @ (2,4) -> Output
    Let's check first occurrences carefully for T3.
    Pa @ (1,1), (1,4), (4,1) -> First (1,1)
    Pb @ (1,4) -> No, (1,4) is `[[2, 5], [5, 5]]` (Pa). Pb=`[[5, 2], [5, 5]]` occurs at (2,4) and (4,4). First (2,4).
    Pc=`[[5, 5], [2, 5]]` occurs at (2,1), (2,4), (5,1). First (2,1).
    Pd=`[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` occurs at (2,4), (5,3). First (2,4).

    Tie-breaker is not first occurrence (P1 in T2, Pa in T3).
    Tie-breaker is not lexicographical smallest (P4 in T2, Pa `[2, 5, 5, 5]` in T3).
    Tie-breaker is not last occurrence?
    T2 Last: P1(2,2), P2(2,3), P3(3,2), P4(3,3) -> P4 chosen. No.
    T3 Last: Pa(4,1), Pb(4,4), Pc(5,1), Pd(5,3) -> Pc chosen. No.

    Could the tie-breaker be the pattern that occurs at the location (row, col) that has the largest row index, then the largest col index amongst the first occurrences?
    T2 First Occurrences: P1(0,0), P2(0,1), P3(1,0), P4(1,1). Max row is 1 (P3, P4). Max col among these is 1 (P4). Selects P4. No.

    Could the tie-breaker be the pattern whose *first occurrence* position (r, c) yields the maximum value of r * grid_width + c?
    T2: width=5. P1(0,0)->0. P2(0,1)->1. P3(1,0)->5. P4(1,1)->6. Selects P4. No.

    This is tricky. The selection rule for ties is elusive. But the overall approach seems promising:
    1. Find all unique 2x2 subpatterns and their frequencies.
    2. Calculate the sum of elements for each unique pattern.
    3. Find the maximum sum (max_S).
    4. Filter patterns to keep only those with sum = max_S.
    5. Find the maximum frequency (max_F) among the filtered patterns.
    6. Filter again to keep only patterns with sum = max_S AND frequency = max_F.
    7. If a unique pattern remains, output its top-left element.
    8. If multiple patterns remain (tie), output the selected pattern itself based on an unknown tie-breaking rule.

    The unknown tie-breaker selected P3 `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` in T2 and Pd `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` in T3 from their respective tied sets.
    T2 Tied Set: {P1, P2, P3, P4}
    T3 Tied Set: {Pa, Pb, Pc, Pd}

    What distinguishes P3 and Pd?
    P3: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`
    Pd: `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`

    Maybe the tie-breaker involves comparing the patterns directly, like finding the one that is lexicographically largest?
    T2: P1[2,1,1,1], P2[1,2,1,1], P3[1,1,2,1], P4[1,1,1,2]. Largest is P1. No.
    T3: Pa[2,5,5,5], Pb[5,2,5,5], Pc[5,5,2,5], Pd[5,5,5,2]. Largest is Pd. Yes!

    **Hypothesis 6 (Refined):**
    1. Find all unique 2x2 subpatterns and their frequencies.
    2. Calculate the sum of elements for each unique pattern.
    3. Find the maximum sum (max_S).
    4. Filter patterns to keep only those with sum = max_S.
    5. Find the maximum frequency (max_F) among the filtered patterns.
    6. Filter again to keep only patterns with sum = max_S AND frequency = max_F.
    7. If a unique pattern remains, output its top-left element.
    8. If multiple patterns remain (tie), flatten each pattern row-wise and select the one that is lexicographically largest. Output this selected pattern.

    Let's test:
    *   **train_1:** Max sum=28 (P1, P4). Max freq among these=4 (P1). Unique pattern P1 remains. Output top-left `8`. Matches.
    *   **train_2:** Tied patterns {P1, P2, P3, P4}. Flatten: P1[2,1,1,1], P2[1,2,1,1], P3[1,1,2,1], P4[1,1,1,2]. Lexicographically largest is P1 `[[2, 1], [1, 1]]`. Output should be `[[2, 1], [1, 1]]`. But the example output is `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` (P3). Hypothesis fails.

    Maybe lexicographically smallest tie-breaker? Selects P4. No.

    I am stuck on the tie-breaker. Let's assume the selection process (max sum, then max freq) is correct and describe it. The tie-breaker remains unclear.

    Let's assume the examples are correct and the rule is "select P3" in T2 and "select Pd" in T3. Is there *any* common property?

    P3: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`
    Pd: `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`

    Maybe compare based on the diagonal elements? Or anti-diagonal?
    P3: diag=(1,1), anti=(1,2)
    Pd: diag=(5,2), anti=(5,5)

    Consider the tied sets again.
    T2: P1=`[[2, 1], [1, 1]]`, P2=`[[1, 2], [1, 1]]`, P3=`[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`, P4=`[[1, 1], [1, 2]]`
    T3: Pa=`[[2, 5], [5, 5]]`, Pb=`[[5, 2], [5, 5]]`, Pc=`[[5, 5], [2, 5]]`, Pd=`[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`

    What if the tie-breaker uses the first occurrence location? Select the pattern whose first occurrence (r,c) minimizes c (column index), and then minimizes r (row index)?
    T2 First Occ: P1(0,0), P2(0,1), P3(1,0), P4(1,1). Min col is 0 (P1, P3). Min row among these is 0 (P1). Selects P1. No.

    Maximize c, then maximize r?
    T2 First Occ: P1(0,0), P2(0,1), P3(1,0), P4(1,1). Max col is 1 (P2, P4). Max row among these is 1 (P4). Selects P4. No.

    Maximize r, then maximize c? (This was tested before - selects P4). No.
    Minimize r, then minimize c? (This was tested before - selects P1). No.

    Let's stick to the general idea: find the 2x2 pattern(s) that are maximal according to some criteria (sum, frequency). If unique result -> top-left. If multiple results -> output the pattern based on some tie-breaker. The exact criteria (max sum -> max freq) and the tie-breaker are the core issues. But this frame seems the most plausible.## Perception of Elements

1.  **Input Data:** The input is a rectangular grid (matrix) of single-digit non-negative integers. The grid dimensions vary across examples.
2.  **Output Data:** The output is either a single integer (train_1) or a smaller rectangular grid of integers (train_2, train_3 - specifically 2x2).
3.  **Core Task:** The task seems to involve identifying a specific 2x2 pattern within the input grid based on certain criteria and then deriving the output from that pattern.
4.  **Key Transformation:** The transformation involves scanning the input grid for all possible 2x2 subgrids (patterns), evaluating these patterns based on properties like frequency of occurrence and sum of elements, and selecting a final pattern or element.
5.  **Pattern Identification:** The process appears to prioritize patterns based on the sum of their elements (selecting the maximum sum) and then their frequency (selecting the maximum frequency among those with the maximum sum).
6.  **Output Determination:**
    *   If the selection process yields a *unique* 2x2 pattern, the output seems to be the top-left element of that pattern (as seen in train_1).
    *   If the selection process results in a *tie* (multiple patterns satisfy the criteria), the output is one of the tied 2x2 patterns itself (as seen in train_2 and train_3).
7.  **Tie-breaking:** A specific, currently unidentified, rule is used to select *which* pattern to output when a tie occurs after considering sum and frequency. Common tie-breakers like lexicographical order (smallest or largest) or position of first/last occurrence do not consistently explain the selection in the provided examples.

```yaml
Input:
  type: grid
  description: A rectangular grid of single-digit integers (0-9).
  properties:
    - rows: integer
    - columns: integer
    - elements: integer digits

Output:
  type: grid or integer
  description: Either a single integer or a small grid of integers.
  properties:
    - case_single: Represents a single element derived from the input.
    - case_grid: Represents a 2x2 subgrid derived from the input.

Transformation:
  action: analyze_subgrids
  object: 2x2 subgrids (patterns) within the input grid.
  steps:
    - identify: Find all unique 2x2 patterns and their frequency.
    - calculate: Compute the sum of elements for each unique 2x2 pattern.
    - filter_sum: Select pattern(s) with the maximum sum.
    - filter_frequency: Among selected patterns, select pattern(s) with the maximum frequency.
  decision_point:
    condition: Number of patterns remaining after filtering.
    branches:
      - if_unique:
          action: extract_element
          source: The unique remaining 2x2 pattern.
          element: Top-left corner.
          result: Single integer output.
      - if_multiple:
          action: tie_break
          source: The set of tied 2x2 patterns.
          rule: An undetermined tie-breaking rule selects one pattern.
          result: 2x2 grid output (the selected pattern).

Relationships:
  - Input grid contains multiple overlapping 2x2 subgrids.
  - Each 2x2 subgrid has properties: frequency, sum of elements.
  - The output is derived from the 2x2 subgrid(s) that maximize sum, then frequency.
  - Output format (single element vs. 2x2 grid) depends on whether the selection process yields a unique pattern or a tie.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Define a "pattern" as a 2x2 subgrid of numbers from the input grid.
2.  Iterate through all possible top-left corner positions in the input grid to identify all unique 2x2 patterns present.
3.  For each unique pattern, calculate its frequency (how many times it appears in the input grid).
4.  For each unique pattern, calculate the sum of its four elements.
5.  Determine the maximum sum (MaxS) found among all unique patterns.
6.  Create a candidate set of patterns containing only those unique patterns whose sum equals MaxS.
7.  From this candidate set, determine the maximum frequency (MaxF) present.
8.  Refine the candidate set, keeping only patterns that have frequency equal to MaxF.
9.  **Check the size of the final candidate set:**
    a.  If the set contains exactly one pattern: The output is the single integer value located at the top-left corner of this unique pattern.
    b.  If the set contains multiple patterns (a tie): Apply a specific tie-breaking rule (currently unknown, but observed to select `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` in train_2 and `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` in train_3 from their respective tied sets) to choose one pattern. The output is this chosen 2x2 pattern itself.
