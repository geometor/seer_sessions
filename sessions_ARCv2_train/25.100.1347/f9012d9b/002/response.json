            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous hypothesis correctly identified the core logic for Example 1 (unique maximal pattern -> top-left element) and Example 3 (tied maximal patterns -> output pattern). However, it failed on Example 2 because the placeholder tie-breaking rule (lexicographically largest flattened pattern) was incorrect.\n\nThe results show that the pattern selection process involves maximizing the sum, then maximizing the frequency. When ties occur, a specific tie-breaking rule based on the *content* of the patterns themselves is needed, rather than their occurrence position or simple lexicographical order.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the tie-breaking rule based on the observed selections in the tied cases (Example 2 and Example 3) and update the natural language program and documentation accordingly.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Size: 4x4\n*   Output Size: 1x1 (single element)\n*   Patterns found: Yes\n*   Max Sum: 28 (Patterns `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]`, `[[6, 8], [8, 6]]`)\n*   Max Frequency among Max Sum: 4 (Pattern `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]`)\n*   Result: Unique pattern `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]` found.\n*   Rule Applied: Output top-left element (8).\n*   Code Output: `[[8]]` (Correctly represents the single element).\n*   Matches Expected: Yes.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Size: 5x5\n*   Output Size: 2x2\n*   Patterns found: Yes\n*   Max Sum: 5 (Patterns `[[2, 1], [1, 1]]`, `[[1, 2], [1, 1]]`, `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`, `[[1, 1], [1, 2]]`)\n*   Max Frequency among Max Sum: 3 (All four patterns listed above)\n*   Result: Tie among 4 patterns.\n*   Rule Applied: Tie-breaker selects one pattern.\n*   Expected Selection: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`\n*   Code Output (using old tie-breaker): `[[2, 1], [1, 1]]`\n*   Matches Expected: No. **Tie-breaker refinement needed.**\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input Size: 7x7\n*   Output Size: 2x2\n*   Patterns found: Yes\n*   Max Sum: 17 (Patterns `[[2, 5], [5, 5]]`, `[[5, 2], [5, 5]]`, `[[5, 5], [2, 5]]`, `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`)\n*   Max Frequency among Max Sum: 3 (All four patterns listed above)\n*   Result: Tie among 4 patterns.\n*   Rule Applied: Tie-breaker selects one pattern.\n*   Expected Selection: `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`\n*   Code Output (using old tie-breaker): `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`\n*   Matches Expected: Yes. (The previous incorrect tie-breaker happened to work here).\n\n**Tie-breaker Analysis (Confirmed):**\nBased on the required selections (`[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` for Ex2, `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` for Ex3), the tie-breaker prioritizes maximizing elements in the order: Bottom-Left, then Top-Right, then Top-Left. (Bottom-right is implicitly determined if needed).\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Represent a pattern `[[a, b], [c, d]]` where `a` is top-left, `b` is top-right, `c` is bottom-left, and `d` is bottom-right.\n2.  Iterate through all possible top-left corner positions `(r, c)` in the input grid such that `r+1` and `c+1` are within bounds, identifying all unique 2x2 patterns.\n3.  For each unique pattern, calculate its frequency (the total number of times it appears in the input grid).\n4.  For each unique pattern, calculate the sum of its four elements (`a + b + c + d`).\n5.  Determine the maximum sum (MaxS) found across all unique patterns.\n6.  Create a first candidate set containing only those unique patterns whose sum equals MaxS.\n7.  From this first candidate set, determine the maximum frequency (MaxF) present among them.\n8.  Create a final candidate set, keeping only the patterns from the first candidate set that also have frequency equal to MaxF.\n9.  **Check the size of the final candidate set:**\n    a.  If the set contains exactly one pattern `[[a, b], [c, d]]`: The output is a 1x1 grid containing the value of the top-left element, `[[a]]`.\n    b.  If the set contains multiple patterns (a tie): Select the single winning pattern from the set by comparing the patterns based on their elements in the following order of priority:\n        i.  Choose the pattern(s) with the highest value for the bottom-left element (`c`).\n        ii.
