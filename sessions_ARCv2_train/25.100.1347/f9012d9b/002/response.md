## General Assessment

The previous hypothesis correctly identified the core logic for Example 1 (unique maximal pattern -> top-left element) and Example 3 (tied maximal patterns -> output pattern). However, it failed on Example 2 because the placeholder tie-breaking rule (lexicographically largest flattened pattern) was incorrect.

The results show that the pattern selection process involves maximizing the sum, then maximizing the frequency. When ties occur, a specific tie-breaking rule based on the *content* of the patterns themselves is needed, rather than their occurrence position or simple lexicographical order.

The strategy is to refine the tie-breaking rule based on the observed selections in the tied cases (Example 2 and Example 3) and update the natural language program and documentation accordingly.

## Metrics and Analysis

**Example 1:**
*   Input Size: 4x4
*   Output Size: 1x1 (single element)
*   Patterns found: Yes
*   Max Sum: 28 (Patterns `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]`, `[[6, 8], [8, 6]]`)
*   Max Frequency among Max Sum: 4 (Pattern `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]`)
*   Result: Unique pattern `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]` found.
*   Rule Applied: Output top-left element (8).
*   Code Output: `[[8]]` (Correctly represents the single element).
*   Matches Expected: Yes.

**Example 2:**
*   Input Size: 5x5
*   Output Size: 2x2
*   Patterns found: Yes
*   Max Sum: 5 (Patterns `[[2, 1], [1, 1]]`, `[[1, 2], [1, 1]]`, `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`, `[[1, 1], [1, 2]]`)
*   Max Frequency among Max Sum: 3 (All four patterns listed above)
*   Result: Tie among 4 patterns.
*   Rule Applied: Tie-breaker selects one pattern.
*   Expected Selection: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`
*   Code Output (using old tie-breaker): `[[2, 1], [1, 1]]`
*   Matches Expected: No. **Tie-breaker refinement needed.**

**Example 3:**
*   Input Size: 7x7
*   Output Size: 2x2
*   Patterns found: Yes
*   Max Sum: 17 (Patterns `[[2, 5], [5, 5]]`, `[[5, 2], [5, 5]]`, `[[5, 5], [2, 5]]`, `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`)
*   Max Frequency among Max Sum: 3 (All four patterns listed above)
*   Result: Tie among 4 patterns.
*   Rule Applied: Tie-breaker selects one pattern.
*   Expected Selection: `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`
*   Code Output (using old tie-breaker): `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`
*   Matches Expected: Yes. (The previous incorrect tie-breaker happened to work here).

**Tie-breaker Analysis (Confirmed):**
Based on the required selections (`[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` for Ex2, `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` for Ex3), the tie-breaker prioritizes maximizing elements in the order: Bottom-Left, then Top-Right, then Top-Left. (Bottom-right is implicitly determined if needed).

## YAML Facts


```yaml
Input:
  type: grid
  description: A rectangular grid of single-digit integers (0-9).
  properties:
    - rows: integer
    - columns: integer
    - elements: integer digits

Output:
  type: grid
  description: >
    Either a 1x1 grid containing a single integer or a 2x2 grid
    of integers derived from the input.
  properties:
    - case_single: Represents a single element derived from the input, wrapped in a 1x1 grid.
    - case_grid: Represents a 2x2 subgrid derived from the input.

Transformation:
  action: analyze_subgrids
  object: 2x2 subgrids (patterns) within the input grid.
  steps:
    - identify: Find all unique 2x2 patterns and their frequency.
    - calculate: Compute the sum of elements for each unique 2x2 pattern.
    - filter_sum: Select pattern(s) with the maximum sum.
    - filter_frequency: Among selected patterns, select pattern(s) with the maximum frequency.
  decision_point:
    condition: Number of patterns remaining after filtering.
    branches:
      - if_unique:
          action: extract_element
          source: The unique remaining 2x2 pattern.
          element: Top-left corner value.
          result: 1x1 grid containing the element.
      - if_multiple:
          action: tie_break
          source: The set of tied 2x2 patterns.
          rule: >
            Select the single pattern from the tied set by comparing them based on
            element values in a specific priority order:
            1. Maximize the Bottom-Left element.
            2. If ties remain, maximize the Top-Right element.
            3. If ties remain, maximize the Top-Left element.
            (The Bottom-Right element comparison is usually not needed).
          result: The selected 2x2 grid.

Relationships:
  - Input grid contains multiple overlapping 2x2 subgrids.
  - Each 2x2 subgrid has properties: frequency, sum of elements.
  - The output is derived from the 2x2 subgrid(s) that maximize sum, then frequency.
  - Output format (1x1 vs. 2x2 grid) depends on whether the selection process yields a unique pattern or a tie.
  - Tie-breaking depends on comparing the content of the tied patterns element by element in priority order (BL, TR, TL).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Define a "pattern" as a 2x2 subgrid of numbers extracted from the input grid. Represent a pattern `[[a, b], [c, d]]` where `a` is top-left, `b` is top-right, `c` is bottom-left, and `d` is bottom-right.
2.  Iterate through all possible top-left corner positions `(r, c)` in the input grid such that `r+1` and `c+1` are within bounds, identifying all unique 2x2 patterns.
3.  For each unique pattern, calculate its frequency (the total number of times it appears in the input grid).
4.  For each unique pattern, calculate the sum of its four elements (`a + b + c + d`).
5.  Determine the maximum sum (MaxS) found across all unique patterns.
6.  Create a first candidate set containing only those unique patterns whose sum equals MaxS.
7.  From this first candidate set, determine the maximum frequency (MaxF) present among them.
8.  Create a final candidate set, keeping only the patterns from the first candidate set that also have frequency equal to MaxF.
9.  **Check the size of the final candidate set:**
    a.  If the set contains exactly one pattern `[[a, b], [c, d]]`: The output is a 1x1 grid containing the value of the top-left element, `[[a]]`.
    b.  If the set contains multiple patterns (a tie): Select the single winning pattern from the set by comparing the patterns based on their elements in the following order of priority:
        i.  Choose the pattern(s) with the highest value for the bottom-left element (`c`).
        ii. If there is still a tie, choose the pattern(s) among the remaining ones with the highest value for the top-right element (`b`).
        iii.If there is still a tie, choose the pattern among the remaining ones with the highest value for the top-left element (`a`). (This should resolve any remaining ties based on the problem constraints).
        The output is the selected 2x2 winning pattern `[[a, b], [c, d]]`.
