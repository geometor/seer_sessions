Rows 0 and 2 remain the same.\n    *   In `train_2`, rows 1, 3, and 5 are changed. Rows 0, 2, and 4 remain the same.\n4.  **Pattern of Change:** The rows being modified are the odd-indexed rows (1, 3, 5, ...).\n5.  **Nature of Change:** Let's examine the transformation within the modified rows:\n    *   `train_1`, Row 1: `[7, 8, 3, 7]` becomes `[7, 7, 8, 3]`\n    *   `train_1`, Row 3: `[7, 8, 3, 7]` becomes `[7, 7, 8, 3]`\n    *   `train_2`, Row 1: `[5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]` becomes `[7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7]`\n    *   `train_2`, Row 3: `[5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]` becomes `[7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7]`\n    *   `train_2`, Row 5: `[5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]` becomes `[7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7]`\n    *   In all cases, the elements within the modified row appear to undergo a right circular shift. The last element moves to the first position, and all other elements shift one position to the right.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
