Objects:
  - Grid: A 2D array of numbers.
    Properties:
      - rows: Number of rows.
      - columns: Number of columns.
      - content: A list of Rows.
  - Row: A 1D array (list) of numbers within the Grid.
    Properties:
      - index: The 0-based position of the row within the Grid (0, 1, 2, ...).
      - elements: The list of numbers in the row.
      - length: The number of elements (equal to Grid columns).
  - Number: Integer values within the grid cells.

Relationships:
  - Grid contains Rows.
  - Row contains Numbers (as elements).
  - Rows have an order defined by their index.

Actions:
  - Identify Rows based on their index property.
  - Select Rows where the index is odd (index % 2 == 1).
  - Perform a right circular shift on the elements of the selected Rows.
    - Definition: The last element becomes the first, and all other elements shift one position to the right.
  - Keep Rows where the index is even (index % 2 == 0) unchanged.
  - Construct the Output Grid using the modified and unchanged Rows.
