Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both inputs and outputs are 2D grids (matrices) containing single-digit integers.
2.  **Grid Dimensions:** The dimensions of the input grid are preserved in the output grid. `train_1` is 4x4, and `train_2` is 6x6.
3.  **Observed Change:** Comparing inputs and outputs, it's clear that only certain rows are modified.
    *   In `train_1`, rows 1 and 3 (0-indexed) are changed. Rows 0 and 2 remain the same.
    *   In `train_2`, rows 1, 3, and 5 are changed. Rows 0, 2, and 4 remain the same.
4.  **Pattern of Change:** The rows being modified are the odd-indexed rows (1, 3, 5, ...).
5.  **Nature of Change:** Let's examine the transformation within the modified rows:
    *   `train_1`, Row 1: `[7, 8, 3, 7]` becomes `[7, 7, 8, 3]`
    *   `train_1`, Row 3: `[7, 8, 3, 7]` becomes `[7, 7, 8, 3]`
    *   `train_2`, Row 1: `[5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]` becomes `[7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7]`
    *   `train_2`, Row 3: `[5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]` becomes `[7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7]`
    *   `train_2`, Row 5: `[5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]` becomes `[7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7]`
    *   In all cases, the elements within the modified row appear to undergo a right circular shift. The last element moves to the first position, and all other elements shift one position to the right.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Objects:
  - Grid: A 2D array of numbers.
    Properties:
      - rows: Number of rows.
      - columns: Number of columns.
      - content: A list of Rows.
  - Row: A 1D array (list) of numbers within the Grid.
    Properties:
      - index: The 0-based position of the row within the Grid (0, 1, 2, ...).
      - elements: The list of numbers in the row.
      - length: The number of elements (equal to Grid columns).
  - Number: Integer values within the grid cells.

Relationships:
  - Grid contains Rows.
  - Row contains Numbers (as elements).
  - Rows have an order defined by their index.

Actions:
  - Identify Rows based on their index property.
  - Select Rows where the index is odd (index % 2 == 1).
  - Perform a right circular shift on the elements of the selected Rows.
    - Definition: The last element becomes the first, and all other elements shift one position to the right.
  - Keep Rows where the index is even (index % 2 == 0) unchanged.
  - Construct the Output Grid using the modified and unchanged Rows.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the row's index (starting from 0).
2.  For each row, check if its index is odd.
3.  If the row index is odd, perform a right circular shift on the elements of that row: move the last element to the first position and shift all other elements one position to the right.
4.  If the row index is even, keep the row unchanged.
5.  Assemble the potentially modified rows into the output grid, maintaining the original order.
