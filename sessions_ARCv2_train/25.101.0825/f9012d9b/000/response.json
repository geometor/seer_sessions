            "text": "## Perception\n\nThe task involves identifying a specific subgrid within a larger input grid and outputting that subgrid. The key seems to lie in using the block of white pixels (color 0) present in the input grid.\n\n1.  **Identifying the Template Size:** The input grid contains a distinct region composed solely of white pixels (value 0). The dimensions (height H, width W) of the bounding box of these white pixels define the size of the subgrid we are looking for.\n2.  **Identifying the Target Pattern:** The output grid corresponds to a subgrid of size HxW found within the input grid. This target subgrid is *not* the block of white pixels itself.\n3.  **Selection Rule:** The crucial step is determining *which* HxW subgrid (that isn't the white block) is the correct output.\n    *   In `train_1`, the white block is 1x1. The output `8` is the first non-white 1x1 subgrid encountered when scanning the input top-to-bottom, left-to-right.\n    *   In `train_2`, the white block is 2x2. The output pattern `1 1 / 2 1` occurs multiple times in the input. The instance chosen is the one that appears first in reading order (`input[1:3, 2:4]`).\n    *   In `train_3`, the white block is 2x2. The output pattern `5 5 / 5 2` occurs multiple times. The instance chosen is the one that appears first in reading order (`input[2:4, 0:2]`).\n    *   The challenge lies in identifying *which pattern* (`8` in train_1, `1 1 / 2 1` in train_2, `5 5 / 5 2` in train_3) is the target pattern *before* finding its first occurrence. The rule for selecting the target pattern is not immediately obvious (e.g., it's not simply the first HxW block encountered, nor the most frequent). However, once the target pattern is identified, the rule seems to be \"output the first occurrence of this pattern\".\n\n## Facts\n\n"
