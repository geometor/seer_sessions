task_elements:
  - Input Grid: A 2D array of pixels (integers 0-9).
  - White Block: A contiguous rectangular subgrid within the input grid consisting solely of white pixels (value 0).
  - Output Grid: A 2D array of pixels, representing a subgrid extracted from the input grid.

properties:
  - White Block defines Template Size:
      object: White Block
      property: dimensions (height H, width W)
      role: Defines the dimensions of the target Output Grid.
  - Output Grid is an Input Subgrid:
      object: Output Grid
      property: content
      relationship: Is identical to a specific HxW subgrid found within the Input Grid.
  - Output Grid is not the White Block:
      object: Output Grid
      relationship: Is distinct from the White Block found in the Input Grid.
  - Selection Ambiguity:
      property: Target Pattern Selection
      description: The specific HxW pattern chosen as the Output Grid is not determined by simple rules like 'first encountered', 'most frequent', 'at (0,0)', etc. based on the provided examples.
  - First Occurrence Rule:
      property: Output Grid Location
      description: Once the correct target pattern P (of size HxW) is identified, the Output Grid corresponds to the first instance of P found when scanning the Input Grid top-to-bottom, left-to-right.

derived_facts:
  - Template Height (H): Determined by the height of the White Block's bounding box.
  - Template Width (W): Determined by the width of the White Block's bounding box.

example_specific_facts:
  - train_1:
      White Block: 1x1 at (0, 2). H=1, W=1.
      Target Pattern: 8.
      Output Location: (0, 0). (First occurrence of '8').
  - train_2:
      White Block: 2x2 at (3, 0). H=2, W=2.
      Target Pattern: [[1, 1], [2, 1]].
      Output Location: (1, 2). (First occurrence of the target pattern).
  - train_3:
      White Block: 2x2 at (5, 5). H=2, W=2.
      Target Pattern: [[5, 5], [5, 2]].
      Output Location: (2, 0). (First occurrence of the target pattern).
