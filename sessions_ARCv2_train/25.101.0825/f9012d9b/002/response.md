## General Assessment

The previous attempt correctly identified the role of the white block in defining the template size (H x W) and that the output is the first occurrence of a specific target pattern of that size found within the input. However, the rule used to *select* the target pattern ('choose the pattern whose first occurrence is top-leftmost') was incorrect, leading to failures on examples 2 and 3.

The analysis revealed a plausible new hypothesis for selecting the target pattern:
1. Identify the template size (H x W) from the white block.
2. Find all unique HxW patterns in the input grid that contain *no* white pixels. Let k be the count of such unique patterns.
3. If k > 1, sort these unique patterns lexicographically.
4. If k equals H * W, select the lexicographically *smallest* pattern as the target.
5. If k does not equal H * W, select the lexicographically *largest* pattern as the target.
6. The final output is the subgrid corresponding to the *first* occurrence (in top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan order) of the selected target pattern within the input grid.

This hypothesis successfully explains all three training examples. The strategy is to implement this refined logic for selecting the target pattern.

## Metrics and Verification

The following metrics were gathered using code execution to verify the refined hypothesis against the training examples.

```
**Correction:** The code execution reveals an error in the previous manual analysis for Example 2. The hypothesis "If k == H*W, select smallest; else select largest" correctly predicts Example 1 and Example 3, but it *incorrectly* predicts Example 2.

*   **Example 1:** k=2, HW=1. k!=HW. Predict Largest: `((8,),)`. Correct.
*   **Example 2:** k=4, HW=4. k==HW. Predict Smallest: `((1, 1), (1, 2))`. Incorrect. Actual target is `((1, 1), (2, 1))`.
*   **Example 3:** k=9, HW=4. k!=HW. Predict Largest: `((5, 5), (5, 2))`. Correct.

The hypothesis needs further refinement. Let's re-examine Example 2 where it failed.

Ex 2: k=4 (no white pixels), HW=4. Patterns sorted: `P4'`, `P3`, `P2'`, `P1'`. (Using P notation from manual analysis, primes denote slight difference if `1,2` vs `2,1` changed order).
Sorted List: `[((1,1),(1,2)), ((1,1),(2,1)), ((1,2),(1,1)), ((2,1),(1,1))]`
Smallest (index 0): `((1,1),(1,2))`
Largest (index 3): `((2,1),(1,1))`
Actual Target (index 1): `((1,1),(2,1))`

Why is the pattern at index 1 selected when k=HW? It's not the smallest or largest. Perhaps the rule depends on the *index* or *position* within the sorted list?

Maybe the rule is: Select the pattern at index `(Wr + Wc) % k`?
Ex 1: W=(0,2). k=2. (0+2)%2 = 0. Select index 0 (Smallest = `[[6]]`). Fails.
Ex 2: W=(3,0). k=4. (3+0)%4 = 3. Select index 3 (Largest = `[[2,1],[1,1]]`). Fails.
Ex 3: W=(5,5). k=9. (5+5)%9 = 1. Select index 1 (`[[2,2],[5,5]]`). Fails.

Let's revert to the core observation: White block gives size HxW. Output is the first occurrence of the target pattern. The selection rule remains elusive.

Given the failure of the complex hypothesis, let's reconsider simpler possibilities or potential misinterpretations of the examples. The most robust part is finding the white block for H, W and finding the first occurrence of the *correct* pattern. The selection is the key.

Could the selection relate to the *colors* present in the white block's neighborhood?
Ex 1: W @ (0,2). Neighbors have 6, 8. Target is 8.
Ex 2: W @ (3,0). Neighbors have {1,2} and {1}. Target has {1,2}.
Ex 3: W @ (5,5). Neighbors have {5,2} and {5,2}. Target has {5,2}.

Hypothesis attempt: Identify H,W. Find all unique non-white HxW patterns {P1..Pk}. Find the set of colors C_adj present in the immediate adjacent (Up, Down, Left, Right) neighbors of the white block. Select the pattern Pi whose color set C_i is "closest" or "most similar" to C_adj?
Ex 1: C_adj = {6, 8}. P1=`[[6]]`, C1={6}. P2=`[[8]]`, C2={8}. Both C1 and C2 are subsets of C_adj. How to break tie? Largest pixel value? Select P2=`[[8]]`. OK.
Ex 2: C_adj = {1, 2}. Candidates P1-P4 have C_i={1,2}. All match exactly. Tie. How to break tie? Smallest lexicographical pattern? P3=`[[1,1],[2,1]]`. OK.
Ex 3: C_adj = {2, 5}. Candidates P1-P9.
   P1 {2}, P2 {2,5}, P3 {2,5}, P4 {2,5}, P5 {2,5}, P6 {2,5}, P7 {2,5}, P8 {2,5}, P9 {2,5}.
   P1 is dissimilar. P2-P9 all match C_adj={2,5}. Tie. Break tie with smallest lexicographical pattern? P1=`[[2,2],[2,2]]` -> smallest overall, but doesn't match C_adj. Smallest *among those that match*? P2=`[[2,5],[2,5]]`. Fails (Target is P9). Break tie with largest lexicographical pattern among those that match? P9=`[[5,5],[5,2]]`. OK.

Revised Hypothesis:
1. Find white block -> H, W. Find its adjacent cells' colors C_adj.
2. Find all unique HxW patterns P_i containing no white pixels. Find their color sets C_i.
3. Filter the patterns to keep only those P_i where C_i is a subset of or equal to C_adj. (Or maybe C_i has largest intersection with C_adj?) Let the filtered set be {F1, ..., Fm}.
4. If m=1, target = F1.
5. If m>1, sort {F1, ..., Fm} lexicographically.
6. Apply a tie-breaking rule based on example index or some other property:
    - If Ex 1 or Ex 3 property: Target = Fm (Largest).
    - If Ex 2 property: Target = F1 (Smallest).
7. Find the first occurrence of Target.

This seems overly complex and reliant on tweaking the tie-breaker.

Let's stick to the simplest description pending further insight: The white block defines the template size, and the output is the first occurrence of a specific pattern selected by an unknown rule. The previous code failed because its selection rule was wrong.

## Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - Input Grid: A 2D array of pixels (integers 0-9).
  - White Block: A contiguous rectangular subgrid within the input grid consisting solely of white pixels (value 0).
  - Candidate Pattern: Any subgrid of the Input Grid with the same dimensions (H x W) as the White Block's bounding box.
  - Target Pattern: The specific Candidate Pattern that appears in the Output Grid.
  - Output Grid: A 2D array of pixels identical to the Target Pattern.

properties:
  - Template Definition:
      object: White Block
      property: Bounding box dimensions (H, W).
      role: Define the required height H and width W for Candidate Patterns and the Output Grid.
  - Pattern Selection:
      object: Input Grid
      action: Identify all unique Candidate Patterns (size HxW) that do not consist entirely of white pixels.
      result: A set of potential Target Patterns {P1, P2, ...}.
      uncertainty: The rule for selecting the specific Target Pattern P_target from this set is not definitively determined by simple properties (e.g., first occurrence, frequency, lexicographical order, adjacency to white block).
  - Output Generation:
      object: Target Pattern (P_target)
      action: Find the first location (top-left corner (r, c), scanning top-to-bottom, left-to-right) where P_target appears in the Input Grid.
      result: The Output Grid is the HxW subgrid extracted from the Input Grid at location (r, c).

derived_facts:
  - Template Height (H): Height of the White Block's bounding box.
  - Template Width (W): Width of the White Block's bounding box.
  - Output Location: Determined by the first occurrence of the (correctly identified) Target Pattern.

example_specific_facts:
  - train_1:
      White Block: 1x1. H=1, W=1.
      Candidate Patterns (non-white): ((8,)), ((6,))
      Target Pattern: ((8,))
      Output Location: (0, 0). (First occurrence of ((8,))).
  - train_2:
      White Block: 2x2. H=2, W=2.
      Candidate Patterns (non-white, no zeros): {((1,1),(1,2)), ((1,1),(2,1)), ((1,2),(1,1)), ((2,1),(1,1))}
      Target Pattern: ((1, 1), (2, 1))
      Output Location: (1, 0). (First occurrence of ((1, 1), (2, 1))). Note: The initial analysis incorrectly stated the output location was (1,2). Code analysis confirms first occurrence is (1,0).
  - train_3:
      White Block: 2x2. H=2, W=2.
      Candidate Patterns (non-white, no zeros): {((2,2),(2,2)), ((2,5),(2,5)), ..., ((5,5),(5,2))} (9 total)
      Target Pattern: ((5, 5), (5, 2))
      Output Location: (2, 2). (First occurrence of ((5, 5), (5, 2))). Note: The initial analysis incorrectly stated the output location was (2,0). Code analysis confirms first occurrence is (2,2).

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Template Size:** Locate the bounding box of all white (0) pixels in the input grid. Let its dimensions be Height (H) and Width (W).
2.  **Identify Candidate Patterns:** Scan the input grid and find all unique HxW subgrids that do *not* consist entirely of white pixels.
3.  **Select Target Pattern:** Apply a selection rule (currently undetermined from examples, requires further insight) to choose one specific pattern (P_target) from the unique candidate patterns identified in step 2.
4.  **Find First Occurrence:** Scan the input grid (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) to find the first location (top-left corner coordinates) where the selected Target Pattern (P_target) appears.
5.  **Extract Output:** Return the HxW subgrid from the input grid starting at the location found in step 4.
