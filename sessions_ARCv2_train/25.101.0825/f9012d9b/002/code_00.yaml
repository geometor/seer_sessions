task_elements:
  - Input Grid: A 2D array of pixels (integers 0-9).
  - White Block: A contiguous rectangular subgrid within the input grid consisting solely of white pixels (value 0).
  - Candidate Pattern: Any subgrid of the Input Grid with the same dimensions (H x W) as the White Block's bounding box.
  - Target Pattern: The specific Candidate Pattern that appears in the Output Grid.
  - Output Grid: A 2D array of pixels identical to the Target Pattern.

properties:
  - Template Definition:
      object: White Block
      property: Bounding box dimensions (H, W).
      role: Define the required height H and width W for Candidate Patterns and the Output Grid.
  - Pattern Selection:
      object: Input Grid
      action: Identify all unique Candidate Patterns (size HxW) that do not consist entirely of white pixels.
      result: A set of potential Target Patterns {P1, P2, ...}.
      uncertainty: The rule for selecting the specific Target Pattern P_target from this set is not definitively determined by simple properties (e.g., first occurrence, frequency, lexicographical order, adjacency to white block).
  - Output Generation:
      object: Target Pattern (P_target)
      action: Find the first location (top-left corner (r, c), scanning top-to-bottom, left-to-right) where P_target appears in the Input Grid.
      result: The Output Grid is the HxW subgrid extracted from the Input Grid at location (r, c).

derived_facts:
  - Template Height (H): Height of the White Block's bounding box.
  - Template Width (W): Width of the White Block's bounding box.
  - Output Location: Determined by the first occurrence of the (correctly identified) Target Pattern.

example_specific_facts:
  - train_1:
      White Block: 1x1. H=1, W=1.
      Candidate Patterns (non-white): ((8,)), ((6,))
      Target Pattern: ((8,))
      Output Location: (0, 0). (First occurrence of ((8,))).
  - train_2:
      White Block: 2x2. H=2, W=2.
      Candidate Patterns (non-white, no zeros): {((1,1),(1,2)), ((1,1),(2,1)), ((1,2),(1,1)), ((2,1),(1,1))}
      Target Pattern: ((1, 1), (2, 1))
      Output Location: (1, 0). (First occurrence of ((1, 1), (2, 1))). Note: The initial analysis incorrectly stated the output location was (1,2). Code analysis confirms first occurrence is (1,0).
  - train_3:
      White Block: 2x2. H=2, W=2.
      Candidate Patterns (non-white, no zeros): {((2,2),(2,2)), ((2,5),(2,5)), ..., ((5,5),(5,2))} (9 total)
      Target Pattern: ((5, 5), (5, 2))
      Output Location: (2, 2). (First occurrence of ((5, 5), (5, 2))). Note: The initial analysis incorrectly stated the output location was (2,0). Code analysis confirms first occurrence is (2,2).
