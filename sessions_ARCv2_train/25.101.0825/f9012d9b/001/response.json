Identify the rectangular bounding box encompassing all white (0) pixels in the input grid. Determine its height (H) and width (W). This defines the template size.\n2. Identify a specific target HxW pattern (P_target) from the input grid. This pattern is not the all-white pattern. (The rule for selecting P_target from multiple candidate patterns is not definitively determined from the provided examples).\n3. Scan the input grid from top-to-bottom, then left-to-right, examining all possible HxW subgrids.\n4. Find the first subgrid encountered during the scan whose pixel pattern exactly matches the identified target pattern (P_target).\n5. Return this first matching subgrid as the output grid.\n\nNOTE: The implementation below uses a placeholder rule for step 2 ('select the non-white pattern whose first occurrence is top-leftmost'), which is known to be incorrect for some examples (train_2, train_3). The correct selection rule remains elusive based solely on the provided training data.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Helper function to find the bounding box of all pixels of a specific color\ndef find_color_bbox(grid: np.ndarray, color: int) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the minimum bounding box containing all pixels of the given color.\n    Returns (min_row, min_col, height, width) or None if color not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = np.where(grid == color)\n    if rows.size == 0:\n        return None\n    min_row, max_row = np.min(rows), np.max(rows)\n    min_col, max_col = np.min(cols), np.max(cols)\n    height = max_row - min_row + 1\n    width = max_col - min_col + 1\n    return min_row, min_col, height, width\n\n# Helper function to extract a subgrid\ndef extract_subgrid(grid: np.ndarray, r: int, c: int, h: int, w: int) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Extracts a subgrid of size h x w starting at (r, c).\"\"\"\n    # Ensure bounds are valid before slicing\n    if r + h > grid.shape[0] or c + w > grid.shape[1]:\n        # This case should ideally not be reached if loops are correct\n        return np.array([[]]) \n    return grid[r:r+h, c:c+w]\n\n# Helper function to check if a grid contains only a specific color\ndef is_solid_color(grid: np.ndarray, color: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Checks if all elements in the grid are equal to the given color.\"\"\"\n    if grid.size == 0: # Handle empty subgrids if they occur\n        return False\n    return np.all(grid == color)\n\n# Helper function to convert numpy array to tuple for dict keys\ndef grid_to_tuple(grid: np.ndarray) -> tuple:\n    \"\"\"Converts a numpy array (grid) to a hashable tuple of tuples.\"\"\"\n    return tuple(map(tuple, grid))\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:  \n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation based on finding a white template block,\n    identifying a target pattern based on that block's size using a placeholder rule, \n    and finding the first occurrence of that target pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_array = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    grid_h, grid_w = input_array.shape\n\n    # 1.
