## Perception

The task involves identifying a specific subgrid within a larger input grid and outputting that subgrid. The key seems to lie in using the block of white pixels (color 0) present in the input grid.

1.  **Identifying the Template Size:** The input grid contains a distinct region composed solely of white pixels (value 0). The dimensions (height H, width W) of the bounding box of these white pixels define the size of the subgrid we are looking for.
2.  **Identifying the Target Pattern:** The output grid corresponds to a subgrid of size HxW found within the input grid. This target subgrid is *not* the block of white pixels itself.
3.  **Selection Rule:** The crucial step is determining *which* HxW subgrid (that isn't the white block) is the correct output.
    *   In `train_1`, the white block is 1x1. The output `8` is the first non-white 1x1 subgrid encountered when scanning the input top-to-bottom, left-to-right.
    *   In `train_2`, the white block is 2x2. The output pattern `1 1 / 2 1` occurs multiple times in the input. The instance chosen is the one that appears first in reading order (`input[1:3, 2:4]`).
    *   In `train_3`, the white block is 2x2. The output pattern `5 5 / 5 2` occurs multiple times. The instance chosen is the one that appears first in reading order (`input[2:4, 0:2]`).
    *   The challenge lies in identifying *which pattern* (`8` in train_1, `1 1 / 2 1` in train_2, `5 5 / 5 2` in train_3) is the target pattern *before* finding its first occurrence. The rule for selecting the target pattern is not immediately obvious (e.g., it's not simply the first HxW block encountered, nor the most frequent). However, once the target pattern is identified, the rule seems to be "output the first occurrence of this pattern".

## Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - Input Grid: A 2D array of pixels (integers 0-9).
  - White Block: A contiguous rectangular subgrid within the input grid consisting solely of white pixels (value 0).
  - Output Grid: A 2D array of pixels, representing a subgrid extracted from the input grid.

properties:
  - White Block defines Template Size:
      object: White Block
      property: dimensions (height H, width W)
      role: Defines the dimensions of the target Output Grid.
  - Output Grid is an Input Subgrid:
      object: Output Grid
      property: content
      relationship: Is identical to a specific HxW subgrid found within the Input Grid.
  - Output Grid is not the White Block:
      object: Output Grid
      relationship: Is distinct from the White Block found in the Input Grid.
  - Selection Ambiguity:
      property: Target Pattern Selection
      description: The specific HxW pattern chosen as the Output Grid is not determined by simple rules like 'first encountered', 'most frequent', 'at (0,0)', etc. based on the provided examples.
  - First Occurrence Rule:
      property: Output Grid Location
      description: Once the correct target pattern P (of size HxW) is identified, the Output Grid corresponds to the first instance of P found when scanning the Input Grid top-to-bottom, left-to-right.

derived_facts:
  - Template Height (H): Determined by the height of the White Block's bounding box.
  - Template Width (W): Determined by the width of the White Block's bounding box.

example_specific_facts:
  - train_1:
      White Block: 1x1 at (0, 2). H=1, W=1.
      Target Pattern: 8.
      Output Location: (0, 0). (First occurrence of '8').
  - train_2:
      White Block: 2x2 at (3, 0). H=2, W=2.
      Target Pattern: [[1, 1], [2, 1]].
      Output Location: (1, 2). (First occurrence of the target pattern).
  - train_3:
      White Block: 2x2 at (5, 5). H=2, W=2.
      Target Pattern: [[5, 5], [5, 2]].
      Output Location: (2, 0). (First occurrence of the target pattern).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the rectangular bounding box encompassing all white (0) pixels in the input grid. Determine its height (H) and width (W).
2.  Identify the specific HxW pattern (P_target) that constitutes the output grid based on a currently undetermined selection rule (this rule needs further refinement based on more examples or insights, as simple frequency or positional rules fail).
3.  Scan the input grid from top-to-bottom, then left-to-right, examining all possible HxW subgrids.
4.  Find the first subgrid encountered during the scan whose pixel pattern exactly matches the identified target pattern (P_target).
5.  Return this first matching subgrid as the output grid.
