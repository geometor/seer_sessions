Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

1. Identify the rectangular bounding box encompassing all white (0) pixels in the input grid. Determine its height (H) and width (W). This defines the template size.
2. Identify a specific target HxW pattern (P_target) from the input grid. This pattern is not the all-white pattern. (The rule for selecting P_target from multiple candidate patterns is not definitively determined from the provided examples).
3. Scan the input grid from top-to-bottom, then left-to-right, examining all possible HxW subgrids.
4. Find the first subgrid encountered during the scan whose pixel pattern exactly matches the identified target pattern (P_target).
5. Return this first matching subgrid as the output grid.

NOTE: The implementation below uses a placeholder rule for step 2 ('select the non-white pattern whose first occurrence is top-leftmost'), which is known to be incorrect for some examples (train_2, train_3). The correct selection rule remains elusive based solely on the provided training data.
