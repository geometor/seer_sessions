task_elements:
  - Input Grid: A 2D array of pixels (integers 0-9).
  - White Block: A contiguous rectangular subgrid within the Input Grid consisting solely of white pixels (value 0).
  - Candidate Pattern: Any HxW subgrid of the Input Grid, where H and W are the dimensions of the White Block's bounding box, that contains *no* white pixels.
  - Target Pattern: The specific Candidate Pattern selected by the transformation rule.
  - Output Grid: A 2D array of pixels identical to the Target Pattern.

properties:
  - Template Definition:
      object: White Block
      property: Bounding box dimensions (H, W).
      role: Define the required height H and width W for Candidate Patterns and the Output Grid.
  - Candidate Identification:
      object: Input Grid
      action: Identify all unique Candidate Patterns (size HxW, no white pixels).
      result: A set of unique Candidate Patterns {P1, P2, ..., Pk}.
  - Candidate Sorting:
      object: Set of unique Candidate Patterns
      action: Sort the patterns lexicographically.
      result: An ordered list S = [S0, S1, ..., S(k-1)].
  - Target Selection Rule:
      condition: Compare k (count of unique candidates) with H * W (template area).
      rule_1: If k == H * W, the Target Pattern is S1 (the second pattern in the sorted list).
      rule_2: If k != H * W, the Target Pattern is S(k-1) (the last pattern / lexicographically largest).
  - Output Generation:
      object: Target Pattern
      action: Find the first location (top-left corner (r, c), scanning top-to-bottom, left-to-right) where the Target Pattern appears in the Input Grid.
      result: The Output Grid is the HxW subgrid extracted from the Input Grid at location (r, c).

derived_facts:
  - Template Height (H): Height of the White Block's bounding box.
  - Template Width (W): Width of the White Block's bounding box.
  - Candidate Count (k): Number of unique HxW subgrids in the Input Grid containing no white pixels.
  - Target Pattern Index: Determined by the Target Selection Rule (either 1 or k-1).
  - Output Location: Determined by the first occurrence of the selected Target Pattern.

      White Block: H=1, W=1. HW=1.
      Candidates (k=2): [ ((6,),), ((8,)) ] (Sorted)
      k != HW. Rule selects index k-1 = 1.

      White Block: H=2, W=2. HW=4.
      Candidates (k=9): [ ..., ((5,5),(5,2)) ] (Sorted)

      Target Pattern: S8 = ((5, 5), (5, 2))
      Output Location: (2, 2).
