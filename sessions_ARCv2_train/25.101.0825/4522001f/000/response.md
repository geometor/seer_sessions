*   **Perception**: The task involves transforming a small input grid into a larger output grid. The output grid's dimensions are exactly three times the input grid's dimensions in both height and width. This suggests a scaling operation where each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a 3x3 block of pixels in the output grid. Observing the color changes, most input pixel colors directly determine the color of their corresponding 3x3 block in the output. However, there's a specific exception: red (2) pixels in the input result in a 3x3 block of white (0) pixels in the output. All other colors seem to map directly (e.g., green input -> green block, white input -> white block).

```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    transformation: scaling_with_color_replacement
    input_grid:
      description: A small grid (e.g., 3x3).
      elements: Pixels with colors including white (0), red (2), green (3).
    output_grid:
      description: A larger grid, dimensions are 3 times the input grid dimensions.
      elements: Pixels with colors including white (0) and green (3). Red (2) is absent.
      derivation: Based on scaling the input grid.
    scaling_factor: 3
    pixel_mapping:
      rule: Each input pixel at (r, c) maps to a 3x3 block in the output grid starting at (r*3, c*3).
      color_rule:
        - condition: Input pixel color is red (2).
          action: Corresponding output 3x3 block is filled with white (0).
        - condition: Input pixel color is not red (2).
          action: Corresponding output 3x3 block is filled with the input pixel's color.
    objects:
      - type: pixel
        properties: color, grid_location
      - type: block (3x3)
        properties: color, grid_location (top-left corner)
        relationship: Derived from a single input pixel.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Determine the height `H` and width `W` of the input grid.
    2.  Create a new output grid with height `3 * H` and width `3 * W`. Initialize all its pixels to white (0).
    3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid using its row index `r` (from 0 to `H-1`) and column index `c` (from 0 to `W-1`).
    4.  Let `input_color` be the color of the input pixel at `(r, c)`.
    5.  Define the target 3x3 block in the output grid: the pixels from row `r * 3` to `r * 3 + 2` and column `c * 3` to `c * 3 + 2`.
    6.  If `input_color` is red (2), leave the target 3x3 block in the output grid as white (0).
    7.  If `input_color` is *not* red (2), fill all pixels in the target 3x3 block in the output grid with `input_color`.
    8.  Return the completed output grid.
