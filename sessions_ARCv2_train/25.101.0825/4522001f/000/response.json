            "text": "*   **Perception**: The task involves transforming a small input grid into a larger output grid. The output grid's dimensions are exactly three times the input grid's dimensions in both height and width. This suggests a scaling operation where each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a 3x3 block of pixels in the output grid. Observing the color changes, most input pixel colors directly determine the color of their corresponding 3x3 block in the output. However, there's a specific exception: red (2) pixels in the input result in a 3x3 block of white (0) pixels in the output. All other colors seem to map directly (e.g., green input -> green block, white input -> white block).\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
