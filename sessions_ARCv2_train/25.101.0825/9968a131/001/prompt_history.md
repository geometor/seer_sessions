Okay, analyzing the provided training examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** Both examples use rectangular grids of different sizes (4x4 and 6x6).
*   **Colors:** The colors involved are orange (7), green (3), azure (8), white (0), and gray (5). The background or default color seems less relevant than specific foreground patterns.
*   **Patterns:** The transformation appears to operate on a row-by-row basis. Changes occur only in rows containing specific two-pixel adjacent sequences.
*   **Transformations:**
    *   In `train_1`, rows containing the sequence `8 3` (azure, green) are modified. Specifically, `7 8 3 7` becomes `7 7 8 3`.
    *   In `train_2`, rows containing the sequence `5 0` (gray, white) are modified. Specifically, `5 0 7 7 7 7` becomes `7 5 0 7 7 7`.
*   **Action:** In both cases, the modification involves inserting the color orange (7) immediately before the identified two-pixel sequence. The row is then truncated from the right if the insertion increases its length beyond the original width.
*   **Triggers:** The transformation is triggered by the presence of *either* the `8 3` sequence *or* the `5 0` sequence. If multiple triggers exist in a row, the transformation applies only to the first (leftmost) occurrence. Rows without either sequence remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Row-based pattern modification via color insertion.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  shape: Variable (e.g., 4x4, 6x6)
  color_palette: [0, 3, 5, 7, 8] # white, green, gray, orange, azure

objects:
  - type: horizontal_sequence
    name: trigger_sequence_1
    value: [8, 3] # azure, green
  - type: horizontal_sequence
    name: trigger_sequence_2
    value: [5, 0] # gray, white
  - type: color
    name: inserted_color
    value: 7 # orange

transformation_logic:
  scope: row-based
  rule:
    - find_first_occurrence: Identify the leftmost instance of either trigger_sequence_1 or trigger_sequence_2 within each row.
    - conditional_action: If a trigger sequence is found at index `i`:
        action: insert_color
        color_to_insert: inserted_color (7)
        position: Immediately before the found sequence (at index `i`).
        post_action: truncate_row
        detail: Ensure the modified row retains the original input row width by removing elements from the right end if necessary.
    - else: If no trigger sequence is found in a row, keep the row unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Define two trigger sequences: Sequence A is `[azure (8), green (3)]` and Sequence B is `[gray (5), white (0)]`.
2.  Define the insertion color as `orange (7)`.
3.  Process each row of the input grid independently.
4.  For the current row, search for the first occurrence (leftmost position) of Sequence A and the first occurrence of Sequence B.
5.  Determine which sequence, if any, appears earliest (at the lowest index) in the row.
6.  If neither sequence is found in the row, keep the row as it is and proceed to the next row.
7.  If one or both sequences are found, identify the sequence that starts at the lowest index (`i`).
8.  Construct a new row by taking the elements of the original row from the beginning up to index `i`, appending the `orange (7)` color, and then appending the rest of the original row starting from index `i`.
9.  Truncate the newly constructed row from the right side so that its length matches the original width of the input grid.
10. Replace the original row with this modified, truncated row.
11. After processing all rows, the resulting grid is the output.
