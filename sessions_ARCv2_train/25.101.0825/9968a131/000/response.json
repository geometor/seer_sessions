The background or default color seems less relevant than specific foreground patterns.\n*   **Patterns:** The transformation appears to operate on a row-by-row basis. Changes occur only in rows containing specific two-pixel adjacent sequences.\n*   **Transformations:**\n    *   In `train_1`, rows containing the sequence `8 3` (azure, green) are modified. Specifically, `7 8 3 7` becomes `7 7 8 3`.\n    *   In `train_2`, rows containing the sequence `5 0` (gray, white) are modified. Specifically, `5 0 7 7 7 7` becomes `7 5 0 7 7 7`.\n*   **Action:** In both cases, the modification involves inserting the color orange (7) immediately before the identified two-pixel sequence. The row is then truncated from the right if the insertion increases its length beyond the original width.\n*   **Triggers:** The transformation is triggered by the presence of *either* the `8 3` sequence *or* the `5 0` sequence. If multiple triggers exist in a row, the transformation applies only to the first (leftmost) occurrence. Rows without either sequence remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Define the insertion color as `orange (7)`.\n3.  Process each row of the input grid independently.\n4.  For the current row, search for the first occurrence (leftmost position) of Sequence A and the first occurrence of Sequence B.\n5.  Determine which sequence, if any, appears earliest (at the lowest index) in the row.\n6.  If neither sequence is found in the row, keep the row as it is and proceed to the next row.\n7.  If one or both sequences are found, identify the sequence that starts at the lowest index (`i`).\n8.  Construct a new row by taking the elements of the original row from the beginning up to index `i`, appending the `orange (7)` color, and then appending the rest of the original row starting from index `i`.\n9.  Truncate the newly constructed row from the right side so that its length matches the original width of the input grid.\n10. Replace the original row with this modified, truncated row.\n11. After processing all rows, the resulting grid is the output."
