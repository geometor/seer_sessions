task_description: Row-based pattern modification via color insertion.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  shape: Variable (e.g., 4x4, 6x6)
  color_palette: [0, 3, 5, 7, 8] # white, green, gray, orange, azure

objects:
  - type: horizontal_sequence
    name: trigger_sequence_1
    value: [8, 3] # azure, green
  - type: horizontal_sequence
    name: trigger_sequence_2
    value: [5, 0] # gray, white
  - type: color
    name: inserted_color
    value: 7 # orange

transformation_logic:
  scope: row-based
  rule:
    - find_first_occurrence: Identify the leftmost instance of either trigger_sequence_1 or trigger_sequence_2 within each row.
    - conditional_action: If a trigger sequence is found at index `i`:
        action: insert_color
        color_to_insert: inserted_color (7)
        position: Immediately before the found sequence (at index `i`).
        post_action: truncate_row
        detail: Ensure the modified row retains the original input row width by removing elements from the right end if necessary.
    - else: If no trigger sequence is found in a row, keep the row unchanged.
