            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task transformation.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are square grids (5x5 in the examples).\n2.  **Central Cross:** Each input grid has a central cross shape (middle row and middle column) composed entirely of orange (7) pixels. This central cross remains unchanged in the output grid.\n3.  **Quadrants:** The central cross divides the grid into four 2x2 quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR).\n4.  **Pixel Changes:** Changes only occur within these four quadrants. Specifically, only pixels that are initially orange (7) *within* these quadrants (i.e., not part of the central cross) are modified. All other pixels (non-orange pixels and the orange pixels on the central cross) retain their original color.\n5.  **Color Replacement:** The orange (7) pixels within the quadrants are replaced by one of two \"source\" colors derived from specific locations in the input grid.\n6.  **Source Color Locations:** The two primary locations seem to be the Top-Right (TR) corner and the Bottom-Right (BR) corner of the input grid.\n7.  **Source Color Exception:** If the Bottom-Right corner pixel is orange (7), its value is not used directly. Instead, the value of the pixel diagonally adjacent towards the Top-Left (at index `[N-2, N-2]`, assuming 0-based indexing and N=grid dimension) is used as the second source color.\n8.  **Quadrant Assignment:** The two derived source colors (let's call them `Color_TR` from the TR corner and `Color_BR` from the BR corner/alternative) are assigned to the four quadrants based on a specific rule. This rule appears to depend on whether the alternative location was used for the BR source color.\n    *   If the standard BR corner value was used: TL and TR quadrants use `Color_BR`; BR quadrant uses `Color_TR`; BL quadrant uses `Color_BR` if `Color_TR < Color_BR`, otherwise it uses `Color_TR`.\n    *   If the alternative BR source value was used (because the BR corner was orange): TL quadrant uses `Color_TR`; the other three quadrants (TR, BL, BR) use `Color_BR`.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Define the Top-Right corner coordinates `P_TR = [0, N-1]`, the Bottom-Right corner coordinates `P_BR = [N-1, N-1]`, and the alternative coordinates `P_Alt = [N-2, N-2]`.\n3.  Get the color value `V_TR` from the input grid at `P_TR`.\n4.  Get the color value `V_BR_raw` from the input grid at `P_BR`.\n5.  Determine if the alternative source must be used: set `use_alt` to true if `V_BR_raw` is orange (7), otherwise set it to false.\n6.  Determine the final second source color `V_BR`: if `use_alt` is true, `V_BR` is the color at `P_Alt`; otherwise, `V_BR` is `V_BR_raw`.\n7.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n8.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the grid.\n9.  Check if the current cell `(r, c)` is an orange (7) pixel that is *not* on the central cross (i.e., `Input[r, c] == 7` and `r != center` and `c != center`).\n10. If it is such a pixel, determine its quadrant:\n    *   Top-Left (TL) if `r < center` and `c < center`.\n    *   Top-Right (TR) if `r < center` and `c > center`.\n    *   Bottom-Left (BL) if `r > center` and `c < center`.\n    *   Bottom-Right (BR) if `r > center` and `c > center`.\n11. Determine the replacement color based on the `use_alt` flag and the quadrant:\n    *   If `use_alt` is true:\n        *   If the quadrant is TL, the replacement color is `V_TR`.\n        *   Otherwise (quadrant is TR, BL, or BR), the replacement color is `V_BR`.\n    *   If `use_alt` is false:\n        *   If the quadrant is TL or TR, the replacement color is `V_BR`.\n        *   If the quadrant is BR, the replacement color is `V_TR`.\n        *   If the quadrant is BL, the replacement color is `V_BR` if `V_TR < V_BR`, otherwise it is `V_TR`.\n12. Update the output grid at `(r, c)` with the determined replacement color.\n13. If the pixel at `(r, c)` did not meet the condition in step 9 (i.e., it was on the central cross or wasn't orange), its value in the output grid remains unchanged from the input.\n14. After checking all cells, return the final output grid."
