GridProperties:
  - type: square grid (NxN, N=5 in examples)
  - center_row: N // 2
  - center_col: N // 2

Objects:
  - name: CentralCross
    pixels: cells (r, c) where r == center_row or c == center_col
    color: orange (7)
    invariant: true
  - name: QuadrantPixels
    pixels: cells (r, c) where r != center_row and c != center_col
    properties: Belong to one of four quadrants (TL, TR, BL, BR) based on r, c relative to center_row, center_col.

SourcePoints:
  - name: P_TR # Top-Right Corner
    location: [0, N-1]
  - name: P_BR # Bottom-Right Corner
    location: [N-1, N-1]
  - name: P_Alt # Alternative for P_BR
    location: [N-2, N-2]

DerivedValues:
  - name: V_TR # Value from P_TR
    value: Input[P_TR]
  - name: V_BR_raw # Raw value from P_BR
    value: Input[P_BR]
  - name: use_alt # Flag indicating if P_Alt is used
    value: (V_BR_raw == 7)
  - name: V_BR # Final second source value
    value: Input[P_Alt] if use_alt else V_BR_raw

TransformationRule:
  - name: PixelUpdate
    target: QuadrantPixels with color orange (7)
    action: Replace color based on quadrant and source values (V_TR, V_BR) and use_alt flag.
    condition: Input[r,c] == 7 and r != center_row and c != center_col
    logic:
      - If use_alt is true:
          - TL quadrant pixels change to V_TR
          - TR, BL, BR quadrant pixels change to V_BR
      - If use_alt is false:
          - TL, TR quadrant pixels change to V_BR
          - BR quadrant pixels change to V_TR
          - BL quadrant pixels change to V_BR if V_TR < V_BR else V_TR
  - name: PixelKeep
    target: All other pixels (CentralCross orange pixels, non-orange QuadrantPixels)
    action: Keep original color.

Relationships:
  - Quadrants are defined by the CentralCross.
  - Transformation depends on values at specific corner locations (P_TR, P_BR) or an alternative location (P_Alt).
  - The assignment of source colors (V_TR, V_BR) to quadrants depends on whether the alternative location was used.
  - The assignment for the BL quadrant when the alternative is not used depends on the numerical comparison between V_TR and V_BR.
