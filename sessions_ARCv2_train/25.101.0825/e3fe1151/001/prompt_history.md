Okay, let's break down the task transformation.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are square grids (5x5 in the examples).
2.  **Central Cross:** Each input grid has a central cross shape (middle row and middle column) composed entirely of orange (7) pixels. This central cross remains unchanged in the output grid.
3.  **Quadrants:** The central cross divides the grid into four 2x2 quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR).
4.  **Pixel Changes:** Changes only occur within these four quadrants. Specifically, only pixels that are initially orange (7) *within* these quadrants (i.e., not part of the central cross) are modified. All other pixels (non-orange pixels and the orange pixels on the central cross) retain their original color.
5.  **Color Replacement:** The orange (7) pixels within the quadrants are replaced by one of two "source" colors derived from specific locations in the input grid.
6.  **Source Color Locations:** The two primary locations seem to be the Top-Right (TR) corner and the Bottom-Right (BR) corner of the input grid.
7.  **Source Color Exception:** If the Bottom-Right corner pixel is orange (7), its value is not used directly. Instead, the value of the pixel diagonally adjacent towards the Top-Left (at index `[N-2, N-2]`, assuming 0-based indexing and N=grid dimension) is used as the second source color.
8.  **Quadrant Assignment:** The two derived source colors (let's call them `Color_TR` from the TR corner and `Color_BR` from the BR corner/alternative) are assigned to the four quadrants based on a specific rule. This rule appears to depend on whether the alternative location was used for the BR source color.
    *   If the standard BR corner value was used: TL and TR quadrants use `Color_BR`; BR quadrant uses `Color_TR`; BL quadrant uses `Color_BR` if `Color_TR < Color_BR`, otherwise it uses `Color_TR`.
    *   If the alternative BR source value was used (because the BR corner was orange): TL quadrant uses `Color_TR`; the other three quadrants (TR, BL, BR) use `Color_BR`.

**Facts:**


```yaml
GridProperties:
  - type: square grid (NxN, N=5 in examples)
  - center_row: N // 2
  - center_col: N // 2

Objects:
  - name: CentralCross
    pixels: cells (r, c) where r == center_row or c == center_col
    color: orange (7)
    invariant: true
  - name: QuadrantPixels
    pixels: cells (r, c) where r != center_row and c != center_col
    properties: Belong to one of four quadrants (TL, TR, BL, BR) based on r, c relative to center_row, center_col.

SourcePoints:
  - name: P_TR # Top-Right Corner
    location: [0, N-1]
  - name: P_BR # Bottom-Right Corner
    location: [N-1, N-1]
  - name: P_Alt # Alternative for P_BR
    location: [N-2, N-2]

DerivedValues:
  - name: V_TR # Value from P_TR
    value: Input[P_TR]
  - name: V_BR_raw # Raw value from P_BR
    value: Input[P_BR]
  - name: use_alt # Flag indicating if P_Alt is used
    value: (V_BR_raw == 7)
  - name: V_BR # Final second source value
    value: Input[P_Alt] if use_alt else V_BR_raw

TransformationRule:
  - name: PixelUpdate
    target: QuadrantPixels with color orange (7)
    action: Replace color based on quadrant and source values (V_TR, V_BR) and use_alt flag.
    condition: Input[r,c] == 7 and r != center_row and c != center_col
    logic:
      - If use_alt is true:
          - TL quadrant pixels change to V_TR
          - TR, BL, BR quadrant pixels change to V_BR
      - If use_alt is false:
          - TL, TR quadrant pixels change to V_BR
          - BR quadrant pixels change to V_TR
          - BL quadrant pixels change to V_BR if V_TR < V_BR else V_TR
  - name: PixelKeep
    target: All other pixels (CentralCross orange pixels, non-orange QuadrantPixels)
    action: Keep original color.

Relationships:
  - Quadrants are defined by the CentralCross.
  - Transformation depends on values at specific corner locations (P_TR, P_BR) or an alternative location (P_Alt).
  - The assignment of source colors (V_TR, V_BR) to quadrants depends on whether the alternative location was used.
  - The assignment for the BL quadrant when the alternative is not used depends on the numerical comparison between V_TR and V_BR.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the dimensions of the input grid, N x N. Calculate the center row and column index (`center = N // 2`).
2.  Define the Top-Right corner coordinates `P_TR = [0, N-1]`, the Bottom-Right corner coordinates `P_BR = [N-1, N-1]`, and the alternative coordinates `P_Alt = [N-2, N-2]`.
3.  Get the color value `V_TR` from the input grid at `P_TR`.
4.  Get the color value `V_BR_raw` from the input grid at `P_BR`.
5.  Determine if the alternative source must be used: set `use_alt` to true if `V_BR_raw` is orange (7), otherwise set it to false.
6.  Determine the final second source color `V_BR`: if `use_alt` is true, `V_BR` is the color at `P_Alt`; otherwise, `V_BR` is `V_BR_raw`.
7.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
8.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the grid.
9.  Check if the current cell `(r, c)` is an orange (7) pixel that is *not* on the central cross (i.e., `Input[r, c] == 7` and `r != center` and `c != center`).
10. If it is such a pixel, determine its quadrant:
    *   Top-Left (TL) if `r < center` and `c < center`.
    *   Top-Right (TR) if `r < center` and `c > center`.
    *   Bottom-Left (BL) if `r > center` and `c < center`.
    *   Bottom-Right (BR) if `r > center` and `c > center`.
11. Determine the replacement color based on the `use_alt` flag and the quadrant:
    *   If `use_alt` is true:
        *   If the quadrant is TL, the replacement color is `V_TR`.
        *   Otherwise (quadrant is TR, BL, or BR), the replacement color is `V_BR`.
    *   If `use_alt` is false:
        *   If the quadrant is TL or TR, the replacement color is `V_BR`.
        *   If the quadrant is BR, the replacement color is `V_TR`.
        *   If the quadrant is BL, the replacement color is `V_BR` if `V_TR < V_BR`, otherwise it is `V_TR`.
12. Update the output grid at `(r, c)` with the determined replacement color.
13. If the pixel at `(r, c)` did not meet the condition in step 9 (i.e., it was on the central cross or wasn't orange), its value in the output grid remains unchanged from the input.
14. After checking all cells, return the final output grid.
