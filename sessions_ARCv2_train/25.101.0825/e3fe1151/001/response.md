"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rules:
1. Identifies a central cross made of orange (7) pixels. This cross remains unchanged.
2. Divides the grid into four quadrants (TL, TR, BL, BR) around the central cross.
3. Identifies two source colors: 
    - V_TR from the top-right corner [0, N-1].
    - V_BR determined by the bottom-right corner [N-1, N-1]:
        - If the bottom-right pixel is orange (7), V_BR is taken from the pixel at [N-2, N-2].
        - Otherwise, V_BR is the value of the bottom-right pixel itself.
4. Iterates through pixels within the four quadrants (not on the central cross).
5. If a quadrant pixel is orange (7), it is replaced according to these rules:
    - If V_BR was determined using the alternative location ([N-2, N-2]):
        - TL quadrant orange pixels change to V_TR.
        - TR, BL, BR quadrant orange pixels change to V_BR.
    - If V_BR was determined using the standard bottom-right corner:
        - TL, TR quadrant orange pixels change to V_BR.
        - BR quadrant orange pixels change to V_TR.
        - BL quadrant orange pixels change to V_BR if V_TR < V_BR, otherwise to V_TR.
6. All other pixels (central cross orange pixels, non-orange quadrant pixels) retain their original color.
