            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code implements a standard 8-directional flood fill (BFS) algorithm, starting from green (3) pixels and spreading into adjacent orange (7) pixels, treating azure (8) pixels as barriers. The execution results clearly show this algorithm does not match the expected outputs for the training examples. The algorithm consistently fills *more* orange pixels than expected (23 extra in Ex1, 9 extra in Ex2).\n\nThis indicates the true transformation rule involves additional constraints not captured by the simple flood fill. The azure barriers likely play a more complex role than simply being impassable, or the connectivity/spread rule itself is different (e.g., restrictions on diagonal movement, influence of neighboring barriers). Notably, some orange pixels adjacent only to other orange/green pixels in the input remain orange in the output (e.g., Ex1(2,4), Ex2(2,2)), which contradicts the standard flood fill logic.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1. Acknowledge the failure of the standard 8-way flood fill model.\n2. Analyze the input/output pairs to refine observations about which orange pixels *do* change vs. which *do not*.\n3. Reformulate the natural language program to describe the observed transformation accurately, even if the precise algorithm/constraint remains elusive. Focus on describing the *outcome* (a specific subset of reachable orange becomes green) rather than an incorrect mechanism (standard flood fill).\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe metrics derived from the code execution in the previous step accurately quantify the discrepancy:\n\n*   **Train 1:**\n    *   Input: 37 Orange, 10 Azure, 2 Green\n    *   Expected Output: 23 Orange, 10 Azure, 16 Green (14 Orange -> Green)\n    *   Code Output (8-way Fill): 0 Orange, 10 Azure, 39 Green (37 Orange -> Green)\n    *   Difference (Code vs Expected): 23 pixels incorrect (all are Orange incorrectly changed to Green).\n*   **Train 2:**\n    *   Input: 17 Orange, 6 Azure, 2 Green\n    *   Expected Output: 9 Orange, 6 Azure, 10 Green (8 Orange -> Green)\n    *   Code Output (8-way Fill): 0 Orange, 6 Azure, 19 Green (17 Orange -> Green)\n    *   Difference (Code vs Expected): 9 pixels incorrect (all are Orange incorrectly changed to Green).\n\nThis confirms the over-filling issue with the standard 8-way flood fill approach.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n3.  Determine the set of orange (7) pixel locations that should change to green (3) based on the following principle: An orange pixel changes to green if and only if it belongs to the specific 'fill zone' defined by the initial green seeds and constrained by the azure barriers according to the task's unique rules.\n4.  *Constraint Definition (Inferred but Uncertain)*: The 'fill zone' includes the initial green seeds and expands outwards 8-directionally through adjacent orange pixels. However, the expansion is limited by a rule that prevents filling certain orange pixels, even if connected to the seeds via other orange/green pixels. This limitation seems related to the proximity or configuration of azure barriers, but is not simply blocking direct paths or filling only cells without any azure neighbors. Standard flood fill does not correctly identify this zone.\n5.  For every orange (7) pixel location identified in step 3 as belonging to the 'fill zone':\n    a.
