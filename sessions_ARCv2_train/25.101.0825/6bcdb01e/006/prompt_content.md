```python
"""
Performs a constrained color spreading operation, visually similar to a flood fill.
The transformation starts from all initial green (3) pixels ('seeds').
It spreads in 8 directions (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) into
adjacent orange (7) pixels ('fillable area'). Azure (8) pixels act as
impassable barriers, blocking the spread.

Orange pixels that are deemed 'reachable' from the initial green seeds,
following the specific rules of connectivity and barrier interaction for this task,
are changed to green (3). Initial green pixels, azure pixels, and orange pixels
that are not reachable according to the task's specific rules remain unchanged.

NOTE: Standard 8-directional flood fill algorithms (like the one implemented below)
have been observed to produce outputs that differ from the provided training examples
for this task (specifically, they tend to fill *more* orange pixels than expected).
This suggests the actual transformation rule involves additional constraints or
modifications to the standard flood fill behavior that are not yet fully captured.
This implementation represents the closest standard algorithm based on visual inspection.
