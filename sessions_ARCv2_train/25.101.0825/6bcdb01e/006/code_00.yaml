Grid:
  - Type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  - Dimensions: Input and output grids have the same dimensions for each example. (Ex1: 7x7, Ex2: 5x5)
Pixels:
  - Types:
    - Orange (7): Represents potentially fillable area. A specific subset changes to green.
    - Azure (8): Represents barriers. Always remain unchanged. They inhibit the spread of green in a way more complex than simple blocking.
    - Green (3): Represents initial seeds. Always remain unchanged. Act as the source for the color change.
  - Counts (Ex1 Input): Orange=37, Azure=10, Green=2
  - Counts (Ex1 Output): Orange=23, Azure=10, Green=16
  - Counts (Ex2 Input): Orange=17, Azure=6, Green=2
  - Counts (Ex2 Output): Orange=9, Azure=6, Green=10
Objects:
  - Seeds: Initial green (3) pixels.
  - Barriers: Azure (8) pixels.
  - Fillable_Area: Regions of orange (7) pixels.
Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Transformation involves spatial relationships (likely 8-directional), but the exact rules are complex.
  - Reachability: Green color spreads from seeds to a subset of orange pixels considered 'reachable' under specific, non-standard constraints.
Transformation:
  - Type: Constrained Color Spreading
  - Source Color: Green (3)
  - Target Color: Green (3)
  - Affected Pixels: A specific subset of Orange (7) pixels.
  - Rule: Orange (7) pixels change to Green (3) if they meet specific criteria related to connectivity to an initial Green (3) seed pixel. This connectivity seems to be based on 8-directional adjacency through Orange or Green pixels but is constrained by the presence and configuration of Azure (8) barriers in a way that prevents some otherwise reachable Orange pixels from changing. Standard flood fill algorithms do not capture this constraint correctly.
  - Changes (Ex1): 14 specific Orange pixels changed to Green.
  - Changes (Ex2): 8 specific Orange pixels changed to Green.
  - Invariants: Azure (8) pixels, initial Green (3) pixels, and a subset of Orange (7) pixels (those not meeting the specific reachability/constraint criteria) remain unchanged.
