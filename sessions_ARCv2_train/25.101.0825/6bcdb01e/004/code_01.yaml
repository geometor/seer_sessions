Grid:
  - Type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  - Dimensions: Input and output grids have the same dimensions for each example. (Ex1: 7x7, Ex2: 5x5)
Pixels:
  - Types:
    - Orange (7): Represents potentially fillable area. Some change to green, some remain orange.
    - Azure (8): Represents barriers. Always remain unchanged. They appear to block the spread of green.
    - Green (3): Represents initial seeds. Always remain unchanged. Act as the source for the color change.
  - Counts (Ex1 Input): Orange=37, Azure=10, Green=2
  - Counts (Ex1 Output): Orange=23, Azure=10, Green=16
  - Counts (Ex2 Input): Orange=17, Azure=6, Green=2
  - Counts (Ex2 Output): Orange=9, Azure=6, Green=10
Objects:
  - Seeds: Initial green (3) pixels.
  - Barriers: Azure (8) pixels.
  - Fillable_Area: Regions of orange (7) pixels.
Relationships:
  - Adjacency: The transformation likely involves adjacency (potentially 8-directional), but the exact rules governing interaction, especially near barriers, are unclear from standard algorithms.
  - Reachability: Green color spreads from seeds to a subset of reachable orange pixels.
Transformation:
  - Type: Constrained Color Spreading / Flood Fill
  - Source Color: Green (3)
  - Target Color: Green (3)
  - Affected Pixels: A subset of Orange (7) pixels.
  - Rule: Orange (7) pixels change to Green (3) if they are reachable from an initial Green (3) seed pixel. The exact conditions defining 'reachability' and the influence of Azure (8) barriers are not fully captured by standard 8-way or 4-way flood fill, as these algorithms over-fill compared to the expected output. The transformation appears to be deterministic based on the input configuration.
  - Changes (Ex1): 14 Orange pixels changed to Green.
  - Changes (Ex2): 8 Orange pixels changed to Green.
  - Invariants: Azure (8) pixels, initial Green (3) pixels, and a specific subset of Orange (7) pixels remain unchanged. The standard 8-way flood fill incorrectly changed an additional 23 Orange pixels in Ex1 and 9 Orange pixels in Ex2.
