            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous attempt used a standard 8-directional flood fill algorithm (BFS) starting from green pixels (3), spreading into adjacent orange pixels (7), and treating azure pixels (8) as non-fillable barriers. The code execution based on this logic resulted in outputs that significantly differed from the expected outputs provided in the training examples. Specifically, the code filled many more orange pixels with green than shown in the expected outputs.\n\nThis discrepancy indicates that the transformation rule is more complex than a simple flood fill or that the initial interpretation of how the barriers (azure pixels) function was incorrect. Attempts to deduce alternative rules (e.g., 4-way fill, fills conditional on neighbor counts or types, stricter diagonal movement) also failed to consistently reproduce the expected outputs across both examples.\n\nGiven the difficulty in matching the examples with standard algorithms, the strategy is to:\n1.  Re-affirm the basic elements: Green (3) starts the fill, Orange (7) is the fillable medium, Azure (8) inhibits the fill.\n2.  Acknowledge the discrepancy: Note that a standard 8-way flood fill (as implemented previously and manually traced) produces results inconsistent with the provided `train_1` and `train_2` expected outputs.\n3.  Hypothesize the *intended* rule: Despite the discrepancies, the visual pattern strongly suggests a flood-fill-like mechanism. The 8-way fill remains the most plausible *intended* base algorithm. The natural language program will describe this mechanism.\n4.  Refine Observations: Document the observed input->output transformation based *purely* on the examples, capturing the pixel counts accurately. This provides ground truth for evaluating any proposed rule.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe following metrics were gathered from the provided examples and the failed code execution attempt.\n\n*code_execution:*\n"
