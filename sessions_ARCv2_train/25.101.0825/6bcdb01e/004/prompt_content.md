"""
Performs an 8-directional flood fill operation starting from green (3) pixels.
The fill spreads into adjacent orange (7) pixels. Azure (8) pixels act as
barriers, blocking the spread. Orange pixels reachable from the initial green
seeds via a path of orange or green pixels, without crossing an azure pixel,
are changed to green in the output. Initial green, azure, and unreachable
orange pixels remain unchanged.
