            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code execution failed, producing outputs with significantly more green pixels than expected. The generated output suggested that the flood fill spread much further than intended, potentially ignoring the azure barrier pixels. However, the code logic itself seemed to correctly implement an 8-way flood fill originating from green pixels, propagating only through orange pixels, and implicitly stopping at azure barriers (since they are not orange).\n\nMy manual trace of the 8-way flood fill logic also seemed to contradict the *expected* output (e.g., predicting cell `(0, 1)` in Example 1 should be filled, while the expected output shows it as orange). This suggests a potential misunderstanding of the core rule, an issue with the provided examples/expected outputs, or a flaw in the previous code execution/reporting.\n\nGiven the inconsistencies, the most robust approach is to refine the understanding based on the *expected* input-output transformation, assuming the examples are correct. The core concept appears to be a conditional fill originating from green (3), spreading into orange (7), and limited by azure (8). The exact condition or mechanism by which azure limits the spread needs clarification. Since simple 4-way or 8-way flood fill (as initially coded and traced) doesn't perfectly match the expected output, the rule must be more nuanced. However, without a clear alternative rule emerging consistently from the examples, the best strategy is to describe the most likely intended mechanism - flood fill - while acknowledging the observed discrepancies require a potentially more complex rule or condition not yet fully captured. We will stick to the standard 8-way flood fill as the primary hypothesis for now, assuming there might have been an error in the previous execution or my trace.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's re-evaluate the examples and expected outputs.\n"
