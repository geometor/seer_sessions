Grid:
  - Type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  - Dimensions: Input and output grids have the same dimensions for each example. (Ex1: 7x7, Ex2: 5x5)
Pixels:
  - Types:
    - Orange (7): Represents potentially fillable area. Some change to green, some remain orange.
    - Azure (8): Represents barriers. Always remain unchanged. They appear to block the spread of green.
    - Green (3): Represents initial seeds. Always remain unchanged. Act as the source for the color change.
  - Counts (Ex1 Input): Orange=37, Azure=10, Green=2
  - Counts (Ex1 Output): Orange=23, Azure=10, Green=16 (14 Orange became Green)
  - Counts (Ex2 Input): Orange=17, Azure=6, Green=2
  - Counts (Ex2 Output): Orange=9, Azure=6, Green=10 (8 Orange became Green)
Objects:
  - Seeds: Contiguous blocks of initial green (3) pixels.
  - Barriers: Contiguous blocks or individual azure (8) pixels.
  - Fillable_Area: Regions of orange (7) pixels.
Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share an edge or a corner (8-directional connectivity seems most likely based on pattern spread, though requires confirmation).
  - Reachability: An orange pixel is reachable from a seed pixel if there is a path between them consisting only of adjacent orange or seed pixels, without passing through an azure pixel.
Transformation:
  - Type: Conditional Color Spreading / Flood Fill
  - Source Color: Green (3)
  - Target Color: Green (3)
  - Affected Pixels: Orange (7)
  - Rule: Orange (7) pixels change to Green (3) if they are reachable from an initial Green (3) seed pixel via a path of adjacent (8-directional) Orange (7) or Green (3) pixels, without the path crossing any Azure (8) pixel.
  - Constraint: The exact mechanism by which Azure (8) pixels block the fill needs confirmation. Simple blocking (cannot enter an Azure cell) appears insufficient to explain the exact boundaries in the expected output. However, the standard flood fill model is the current best hypothesis.
  - Invariants: Azure (8) pixels, initial Green (3) pixels, and unreachable/unfilled Orange (7) pixels remain unchanged.
