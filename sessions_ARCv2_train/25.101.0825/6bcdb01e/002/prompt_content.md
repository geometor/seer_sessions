def transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
    """
    Performs a flood fill operation on the input grid.

    The flood fill starts from all initial green (3) pixels. It spreads
    in 8 directions (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) to adjacent
    orange (7) pixels. Azure (8) pixels act as barriers and block the spread.
    Orange pixels reachable from the initial green seeds without crossing
    an azure barrier are changed to green. Initial green pixels, azure pixels,
    and unreachable orange pixels remain unchanged.

    Args:
        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input 2D grid.

    Returns:
        A list of lists representing the transformed 2D grid.
