Azure (8) pixels act as\nimpassable barriers, blocking the spread.\n\nOrange pixels that are deemed 'reachable' from the initial green seeds,\nfollowing the specific rules of connectivity and barrier interaction for this task,\nare changed to green (3). Initial green pixels, azure pixels, and orange pixels\nthat are not reachable according to the task's specific rules remain unchanged.\n\nNOTE: Standard 8-directional flood fill algorithms (like the one implemented below)\nhave been observed to produce outputs that differ from the provided training examples\nfor this task (specifically, they tend to fill *more* orange pixels than expected).\nThis suggests the actual transformation rule involves additional constraints or\nmodifications to the standard flood fill behavior that are not yet fully captured.\nThis implementation represents the closest standard algorithm based on visual inspection.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport copy\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define color constants for clarity\nORANGE = 7\nGREEN = 3\nAZURE = 8\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on an 8-directional flood fill rule,\n    acknowledging potential discrepancies with expected task behavior.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input 2D grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed 2D grid.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Get grid dimensions\n    height = len(input_grid)\n    if height == 0:\n        return []\n    width = len(input_grid[0])\n    if width == 0:\n        # Return grid of empty rows matching input height if width is 0\n        return [[] for _ in range(height)] \n\n    # Initialize output_grid as a deep copy to modify\n    output_grid = copy.deepcopy(input_grid)\n\n    # Initialize queue for Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n    queue = deque()\n    # Keep track of visited cells ((row, col) tuples) to avoid cycles and redundant work\n    visited = set()\n\n    # Find initial green seed pixels.\n    # Add their locations to the queue to start the BFS and mark them as visited.\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            if input_grid[r][c] == GREEN:\n                seed_location = (r, c)\n                # Ensure seeds are not added multiple times if they are adjacent\n                # and already processed during this initial scan.\n                if seed_location not in visited:\n                    queue.append(seed_location)\n                    visited.add(seed_location)\n\n    # Define the 8 possible relative offsets for neighbors (including diagonals)\n    directions = [\n        (-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1),  # Above row (NW, N, NE)\n        (0, -1),          (0, 1),   # Current row (W, E)\n        (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)    # Below row (SW, S, SE)\n    ]\n\n    # Perform the flood fill using BFS\n    while queue:\n        # Get the current location (pixel) from the front of the queue\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Explore neighbors in all 8 directions\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            # Calculate neighbor coordinates\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            neighbor_location = (nr, nc)\n\n            # Check 1: Is the neighbor within the grid boundaries?\n            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                # Check 2: Has the neighbor already been visited?\n                if neighbor_location not in visited:\n                    # Check 3: Is the neighbor an orange pixel (fillable) in the *original* input grid?\n                    # Azure pixels (barriers) and already green pixels (initial or filled) will fail this check.\n                    if input_grid[nr][nc] == ORANGE:\n                        # If checks pass, this is a valid pixel to fill:\n                        # 1.
