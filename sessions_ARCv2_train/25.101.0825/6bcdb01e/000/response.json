The core transformation appears to be a color-spreading or flood-fill mechanism. The green pixels present in the input act as starting points or \"seeds\". This green color spreads outwards into adjacent orange pixels. The azure pixels act as barriers, preventing the spread of the green color. The spread considers adjacency in all 8 directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal). Orange pixels that are reachable from the initial green pixels without crossing an azure barrier are changed to green in the output. Pixels that were initially green or azure remain unchanged, as do orange pixels that are not reachable from the initial green seeds due to barriers or simple disconnection.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Some change to green.\n    - Azure (8): Represents barriers. They remain unchanged and block the fill.\n    - Green (3): Represents the initial seeds for the fill. They remain unchanged.\nObjects:\n  - Seeds: Initial green (3) pixels.\n  - Barriers: Azure (8) pixels.\n  - Fillable_Area: Orange (7) pixels.\nRelationships:\n  - Adjacency: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share an edge or a corner (8-directional connectivity).\n  - Reachability: An orange pixel is reachable from a seed pixel if there is a path between them consisting only of adjacent orange or seed pixels, without passing through an azure pixel.\nAction:\n  - Type: Flood Fill / Color Spread\n  - Start Points: All initial green (3) pixels.\n  - Fill Color: Green (3).\n  - Fillable Pixels: Orange (7) pixels.\n  - Termination: The fill stops at grid boundaries, azure (8) pixels, or when all reachable orange pixels have been filled.\nTransformation:\n  - Rule: Identify all orange (7) pixels reachable from any initial green (3) pixel via 8-directional adjacent orange paths, without crossing any azure (8) pixel. Change these reachable orange pixels to green (3).\n  - Invariant: Azure (8) pixels, initial green (3) pixels, and unreachable orange (7) pixels remain unchanged.\n```"

Identify all locations (coordinates) of the initial green (3) pixels in the input grid. These are the starting points for the fill.\n3.  Create a list or queue of locations to visit, initially populated with the locations of the green seed pixels.\n4.  Create a set or grid to keep track of visited locations to avoid redundant processing. Add the initial green seed locations to the visited set.\n5.  While the list of locations to visit is not empty:\n    a.  Remove a location (current\\_row, current\\_col) from the list.\n    b.  Examine all 8 neighbors (neighbor\\_row, neighbor\\_col) of the current location.\n    c.  For each neighbor:\n        i.  Check if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries.\n        ii. Check if the neighbor has already been visited.\n        iii. Check if the neighbor's color in the *input* grid is orange (7).\n        iv. If the neighbor is within bounds, not visited, and is orange (7):\n            1.  Change the color of this neighbor pixel in the *output* grid to green (3).\n            2.  Add the neighbor's location to the list of locations to visit.\n            3.  Mark the neighbor's location as visited.\n6.  Return the modified output grid."
