Grid:
  - Type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  - Dimensions: Same for input and output in each example.
Pixels:
  - Types:
    - Orange (7): Represents the fillable area. Some change to green.
    - Azure (8): Represents barriers. They remain unchanged and block the fill.
    - Green (3): Represents the initial seeds for the fill. They remain unchanged.
Objects:
  - Seeds: Initial green (3) pixels.
  - Barriers: Azure (8) pixels.
  - Fillable_Area: Orange (7) pixels.
Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share an edge or a corner (8-directional connectivity).
  - Reachability: An orange pixel is reachable from a seed pixel if there is a path between them consisting only of adjacent orange or seed pixels, without passing through an azure pixel.
Action:
  - Type: Flood Fill / Color Spread
  - Start Points: All initial green (3) pixels.
  - Fill Color: Green (3).
  - Fillable Pixels: Orange (7) pixels.
  - Termination: The fill stops at grid boundaries, azure (8) pixels, or when all reachable orange pixels have been filled.
Transformation:
  - Rule: Identify all orange (7) pixels reachable from any initial green (3) pixel via 8-directional adjacent orange paths, without crossing any azure (8) pixel. Change these reachable orange pixels to green (3).
  - Invariant: Azure (8) pixels, initial green (3) pixels, and unreachable orange (7) pixels remain unchanged.
