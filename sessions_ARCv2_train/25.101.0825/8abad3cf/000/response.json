            "text": "**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming an input grid of colored pixels into a smaller or differently shaped output grid. The transformation seems to rearrange pixels based on their color, count, and potentially their original spatial properties, creating rectangular blocks in the output.\n\n1.  **Color Analysis:** The input grid contains multiple colors. The frequency (count) of each color appears important.\n2.  **Dominant Color:** In both examples, one color is significantly more frequent than others (Orange). This color acts as a background or filler in the output.\n3.  **Special Colors:**\n    *   Some colors appear only once (Blue in train_1). This 'pixel color' seems to have a special role.\n    *   Other non-dominant colors ('block colors') have counts greater than 1.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output consists of solid rectangular blocks, potentially with a single pixel placed, arranged horizontally, and separated by columns filled with the dominant color.\n5.  **Block Dimensions:** The dimensions of the output blocks seem related to the input counts of the corresponding colors. Specifically, the width of a block for a color `C` with `N` pixels appears to be `floor(sqrt(N))`. The height of all blocks is uniform and depends on the number of non-dominant colors.\n6.  **Arrangement Logic:** The horizontal arrangement (order) of the blocks and the pixel color seems to depend on the color indices and whether a single pixel color exists in the input. Gaps filled with the dominant color are inserted between these elements.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify three types of colors:\n    a.  The 'dominant color': the color that appears most frequently.\n    b.  The 'pixel color': any color that appears exactly once (there will be at most one such color).\n    c.  The 'block colors': all other colors (not dominant, count > 1).\n3.  Calculate the height `H` for the output grid: `H` is the count of block colors, plus 1 if a pixel color exists, plus 1 more.\n4.  For each block color, calculate its corresponding width `W` by taking the integer part of the square root of its pixel count in the input. These colors will form solid rectangular blocks of size `H x W` in the output.\n5.  Determine the horizontal arrangement order of the pixel color (if present) and the block colors:\n    a.  If a pixel color exists, sort the block colors by their color index number in *descending* order. The final arrangement order is: the pixel color first, followed by the sorted block colors.\n    b.  If no pixel color exists, sort the block colors by their color index number in *ascending* order. This is the final arrangement order.\n6.  Calculate the total width `W_total` for the output grid. This is the sum of the widths `W` for all block colors, plus 1 (for the pixel color's column if it exists), plus 1 for each gap needed between adjacent elements in the arrangement (i.e., number of elements minus 1).\n7.  Create a new grid of size `H x W_total`, initially filled entirely with the dominant color.\n8.  Place the elements (pixel color and block color rectangles) into the output grid according to the determined arrangement order, from left to right:\n    a.  If the element is the pixel color, place its color at row `H-1` in the current column. Advance the current column position by 1.\n    b.  If the element is a block color, fill the rectangle of size `H x W` starting at row 0 in the current column with its color. Advance the current column position by `W`.\n    c.  After placing an element (unless it's the very last one), skip the next column (leave it filled with the dominant color) to create a gap. Advance the current column position by 1.\n9.  The resulting grid is the final output."
