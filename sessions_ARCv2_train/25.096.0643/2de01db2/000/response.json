The transformation appears to operate row by row independently.\n2.  **Key Objects:** The primary objects are the numbers within each row. The number 0 seems to play a special role, often acting as a background or fill value. Non-zero numbers are the active elements.\n3.  **Row Properties:** Within each row, the frequency of each non-zero number seems important. The relative positions of numbers are also critical.\n4.  **Transformation Nature:** The transformation modifies the numbers within each row based on the content of that row. It looks like a filtering or mapping process based on identifying a specific \"primary\" number for each row. Zeros in the input are replaced by the primary number, and occurrences of the primary number in the input are replaced by zero. Other distinct non-zero numbers in the input are also replaced by the primary number.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
