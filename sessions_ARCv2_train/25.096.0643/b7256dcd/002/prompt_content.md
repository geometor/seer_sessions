"""
Transforms a 2D grid of integers based on connected components of non-7 values.

The transformation logic identifies connected components (using 4-directional adjacency) 
of identical numbers, excluding the number 7 which acts as a background. 
The transformation applied to each component depends on its original value and its size 
(number of cells).

Rules:
1. Cells with the value 7 remain unchanged.
2. Isolated non-6 numbers (components of size 1) are changed to 7.
3. Components of the number 6 are transformed based on their size:
    - Size 1: Remains 6.
    - Size 2: Changed to 3.
    - Size 3: Remains 6.
    - Size 4: Changed to 1.
    - Size 5: Changed to 4.
    - Other sizes (if any occur): Remain 6 (based on observed patterns and default assumption).
4. Other components (non-6 value, size > 1) retain their original value (though not explicitly seen in examples, this is the default).
