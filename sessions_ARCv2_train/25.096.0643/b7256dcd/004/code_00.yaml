elements:
  - element: Grid
    properties:
      - rows: integer
      - columns: integer
      - cells: list of list of integers
  - element: Cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - row_index: integer
      - column_index: integer
      - is_background: boolean (true if value is 7)
  - element: Component
    properties:
      - cells: list of Cell objects (represented by row, col tuples)
      - value: integer (the common value of cells in the component, must not be 7)
      - size: integer (number of cells in the component)
      - neighbor_cells: set of Cell objects (adjacent cells not in the component)
      - neighbor_count: integer (number of unique neighbor cells)
      - connectivity: 4-directional (horizontal and vertical adjacency)

actions:
  - action: Identify Components and Neighbors
    description: Scan the input grid to find connected regions of cells sharing the same non-7 value. Use 4-directional adjacency. For each component, identify all unique adjacent cells that are not part of the component.
    inputs:
      - input_grid: Grid
    outputs:
      - components: list of Component objects (each including value, size, cells, neighbor_count)

  - action: Determine Transformation Value
    description: Calculate the new value for a component based on its original value, size, and neighbor count according to the transformation rules.
    inputs:
      - component: Component
    outputs:
      - new_value: integer

  - action: Apply Transformation
    description: Update the value of all cells within a component in the output grid to the determined new value.
    inputs:
      - component: Component
      - new_value: integer
      - output_grid: Grid
    outputs:
      - updated_output_grid: Grid

transformation_rules:
  - rule: Background Preservation
    condition: Cell value is 7.
    action: Keep cell value as 7 in the output.
  - rule: Isolated Non-6 Transformation
    condition: Component value is NOT 6 AND Component size is 1.
    action: Change the value of the component's cell(s) to 7.
  - rule: Default Non-6 Preservation
    condition: Component value is NOT 6 AND Component size is > 1.
    action: Keep the original value of the component's cells.
  - rule: Value 6 Transformation (Size/Neighbor Dependent)
    condition: Component value IS 6.
    sub_rules:
      - condition: Component size is 2.
        action: Change the value of the component's cells to 3.
      - condition: Component size is 4 AND Component neighbor_count is 5.
        action: Keep the value 6.
      - condition: Component size is 4 AND Component neighbor_count is 6.
        action: Change the value of the component's cells to 1.
      - condition: Component size is 5.
        action: Change the value of the component's cells to 4.
      - condition: Otherwise (covers size 1, size 3, other size 4 neighbor counts, sizes > 5).
        action: Keep the value 6.

relationships:
  - relationship: Adjacency
    description: Cells are adjacent if they share an edge (horizontally or vertically).
  - relationship: Component Membership
    description: A cell belongs to a component if it shares the same non-7 value as other cells in the component and is connected to them through a path of adjacent cells with that same value.
  - relationship: Neighborship
    description: A cell is a neighbor of a component if it is adjacent to at least one cell in the component but is not part of the component itself.
