            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the core concept of transforming connected components based on value and size. However, it failed on the second training example (`train_2`) because the transformation rule for components with value 6 was oversimplified. Specifically, the code assumed a single output value for all size 4 components of value 6, whereas the training data shows two different outcomes for size 4 components, requiring a more nuanced rule.\n\nThe analysis revealed discrepancies in the transformation of two different components of value 6, both of size 4, in `train_2`. One transformed to 6 (remained unchanged), and the other transformed to 1. The key difference identified through systematic component analysis (using `tool_code`) was the number of unique neighbouring cells (cells adjacent to the component but not part of it).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Component Analysis:** Enhance the component identification process to include calculating the number of unique neighbouring cells for each component.\n2.  **Update Transformation Rules:** Modify the rules, particularly for components with value 6, to incorporate the neighbour count as a condition, especially for size 4 components. Ensure rules for other sizes (like 1 and 3) are explicitly handled or correctly fall under a default case.\n3.  **Revise YAML Facts:** Update the `Component` properties and `transformation_rules` to reflect the dependency on neighbour count.\n4.  **Rewrite Natural Language Program:** Adjust the program steps to include neighbour counting and the refined conditional logic for transformations.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics were gathered using `tool_code` to systematically identify components, their sizes, values, and neighbour counts in both training examples.\n\n**Train 1 Analysis:**\n\n*   Component 1: Value=6, Size=2, Neighbors=4 -> Output Value: 3\n*   Component 2: Value=3, Size=1, Neighbors=3 -> Output Value: 7\n*   Component 3: Value=4, Size=1, Neighbors=4 -> Output Value: 7\n*   Component 4: Value=6, Size=5, Neighbors=6 -> Output Value: 4\n\n**Train 2 Analysis:**\n\n*   Component 1: Value=6, Size=4, Neighbors=5 -> Output Value: 6\n*   Component 2: Value=3, Size=1, Neighbors=3 -> Output Value: 7\n*   Component 3: Value=1, Size=1, Neighbors=3 -> Output Value: 7\n*   Component 4: Value=6, Size=4, Neighbors=6 -> Output Value: 1\n\nThese metrics confirm that isolated non-6 numbers become 7. For value 6: size 2 becomes 3, size 5 becomes 4. Crucially, for value 6 and size 4, the outcome depends on the neighbour count: 5 neighbours results in 6, while 6 neighbours results in 1.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

If the cell `(r, c)` has already been visited or its value is 7, skip to the next cell.\n5.  If the cell `(r, c)` is unvisited and not 7, initiate a search (e.g., Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) to identify the connected component it belongs to:\n    a.  Store the `component_value` (value at `input_grid[r][c]`).\n    b.  Initialize an empty list `current_component_cells` to store `(row, col)` tuples of cells in this component.\n    c.  Initialize an empty set `neighbor_cells` to store `(row, col)` tuples of unique neighbour cells.\n    d.  Initialize a queue/stack for the search, starting with `(r, c)`. Mark `(r, c)` as visited.\n    e.  While the search queue/stack is not empty:\n        i.  Get the current cell `(curr_r, curr_c)`.\n        ii.
