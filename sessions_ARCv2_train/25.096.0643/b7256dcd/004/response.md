## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code correctly identified the core concept of transforming connected components based on value and size. However, it failed on the second training example (`train_2`) because the transformation rule for components with value 6 was oversimplified. Specifically, the code assumed a single output value for all size 4 components of value 6, whereas the training data shows two different outcomes for size 4 components, requiring a more nuanced rule.

The analysis revealed discrepancies in the transformation of two different components of value 6, both of size 4, in `train_2`. One transformed to 6 (remained unchanged), and the other transformed to 1. The key difference identified through systematic component analysis (using `tool_code`) was the number of unique neighbouring cells (cells adjacent to the component but not part of it).

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Component Analysis:** Enhance the component identification process to include calculating the number of unique neighbouring cells for each component.
2.  **Update Transformation Rules:** Modify the rules, particularly for components with value 6, to incorporate the neighbour count as a condition, especially for size 4 components. Ensure rules for other sizes (like 1 and 3) are explicitly handled or correctly fall under a default case.
3.  **Revise YAML Facts:** Update the `Component` properties and `transformation_rules` to reflect the dependency on neighbour count.
4.  **Rewrite Natural Language Program:** Adjust the program steps to include neighbour counting and the refined conditional logic for transformations.

## Metrics

Metrics were gathered using `tool_code` to systematically identify components, their sizes, values, and neighbour counts in both training examples.

**Train 1 Analysis:**

*   Component 1: Value=6, Size=2, Neighbors=4 -> Output Value: 3
*   Component 2: Value=3, Size=1, Neighbors=3 -> Output Value: 7
*   Component 3: Value=4, Size=1, Neighbors=4 -> Output Value: 7
*   Component 4: Value=6, Size=5, Neighbors=6 -> Output Value: 4

**Train 2 Analysis:**

*   Component 1: Value=6, Size=4, Neighbors=5 -> Output Value: 6
*   Component 2: Value=3, Size=1, Neighbors=3 -> Output Value: 7
*   Component 3: Value=1, Size=1, Neighbors=3 -> Output Value: 7
*   Component 4: Value=6, Size=4, Neighbors=6 -> Output Value: 1

These metrics confirm that isolated non-6 numbers become 7. For value 6: size 2 becomes 3, size 5 becomes 4. Crucially, for value 6 and size 4, the outcome depends on the neighbour count: 5 neighbours results in 6, while 6 neighbours results in 1.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Create a `visited` grid of the same dimensions as the input, initially all `False`, to track processed cells.
3.  Iterate through each cell (`r`, `c`) of the `input_grid`.
4.  If the cell `(r, c)` has already been visited or its value is 7, skip to the next cell.
5.  If the cell `(r, c)` is unvisited and not 7, initiate a search (e.g., Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) to identify the connected component it belongs to:
    a.  Store the `component_value` (value at `input_grid[r][c]`).
    b.  Initialize an empty list `current_component_cells` to store `(row, col)` tuples of cells in this component.
    c.  Initialize an empty set `neighbor_cells` to store `(row, col)` tuples of unique neighbour cells.
    d.  Initialize a queue/stack for the search, starting with `(r, c)`. Mark `(r, c)` as visited.
    e.  While the search queue/stack is not empty:
        i.  Get the current cell `(curr_r, curr_c)`.
        ii. Add `(curr_r, curr_c)` to `current_component_cells`.
        iii. Examine its four neighbours (up, down, left, right).
        iv. For each neighbour `(next_r, next_c)`:
            *   Check if the neighbour is within the grid boundaries.
            *   If the neighbour is within bounds:
                *   If the neighbour has the same `component_value` and has not been visited: Mark it as visited and add it to the search queue/stack.
                *   If the neighbour has a different value (including 7): Add `(next_r, next_c)` to the `neighbor_cells` set.
6.  Once the search completes for the component:
    a.  Calculate `component_size` = number of cells in `current_component_cells`.
    b.  Calculate `neighbor_count` = number of unique cells in `neighbor_cells`.
7.  Determine the `new_value` for the component based on its `component_value`, `component_size`, and `neighbor_count`:
    a.  If `component_value` is not 6:
        *   If `component_size` is 1, set `new_value` to 7.
        *   Else (size > 1), set `new_value` to `component_value`.
    b.  If `component_value` is 6:
        *   If `component_size` is 2, set `new_value` to 3.
        *   Else if `component_size` is 4 and `neighbor_count` is 5, set `new_value` to 6.
        *   Else if `component_size` is 4 and `neighbor_count` is 6, set `new_value` to 1.
        *   Else if `component_size` is 5, set `new_value` to 4.
        *   Else (covers size 1, size 3, other size 4 combinations, sizes > 5), set `new_value` to 6.
8.  Iterate through all `(cell_r, cell_c)` in `current_component_cells` and update `output_grid[cell_r][cell_c]` to `new_value`.
9.  After iterating through all cells of the `input_grid`, return the `output_grid`.
