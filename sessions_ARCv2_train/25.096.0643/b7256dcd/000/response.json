The number 7 seems to function as a background or neutral element, remaining unchanged. The core logic involves identifying contiguous blocks (horizontally or vertically adjacent) of the same number (other than 7) and then modifying the numbers within those blocks based on two factors: the original number in the block and the size (number of cells) of the block.\n\nSpecifically:\n1.  Isolated non-6 numbers (components of size 1) are changed to 7.\n2.  Components composed of the number 6 are transformed based on their size:\n    *   Size 1: Remain 6.\n    *   Size 2: Change to 3.\n    *   Size 3: Remain 6.\n    *   Size 4: Change to 1.\n    *   Size 5: Change to 4.\n3.  All cells originally containing 7 remain 7.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Create a `visited` grid of the same dimensions, initially all `False`, to keep track of cells already processed as part of a component.\n3.  Iterate through each cell (`r`, `c`) of the input grid.\n4.  If the cell `(r, c)` has already been visited or its value is 7, continue to the next cell.\n5.  If the cell `(r, c)` has not been visited and its value is not 7, start a search (e.g., Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) from this cell to find its connected component:\n    a.  Initialize a list `current_component_cells` to store the coordinates of cells in the component.\n    b.  Initialize a queue or stack for the search, starting with `(r, c)`.\n    c.  Mark `(r, c)` as visited.\n    d.  Store the `component_value` (the value at `input_grid[r][c]`).\n    e.  While the search queue/stack is not empty:\n        i.  Dequeue/pop a cell `(curr_r, curr_c)`.\n        ii. Add `(curr_r, curr_c)` to `current_component_cells`.\n        iii. Examine its four neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n        iv. For each valid neighbor `(next_r, next_c)` that is within grid bounds, has not been visited, and has the same `component_value` as the starting cell:\n            *   Mark `(next_r, next_c)` as visited.\n            *   Enqueue/push `(next_r, next_c)`.\n6.  Once the search is complete for the current component, determine its `component_size` (the number of cells in `current_component_cells`).\n7.  Determine the `new_value` for the cells in this component based on the `component_value` and `component_size`:\n    a.  If `component_value` is not 6 and `component_size` is 1, set `new_value` to 7.\n    b.  If `component_value` is 6:\n        *   If `component_size` is 1, set `new_value` to 6.\n        *   If `component_size` is 2, set `new_value` to 3.\n        *   If `component_size` is 3, set `new_value` to 6.\n        *   If `component_size` is 4, set `new_value` to 1.\n        *   If `component_size` is 5, set `new_value` to 4.\n        *   Otherwise (for other sizes, if applicable), set `new_value` to the original `component_value` (6).\n    c.  Otherwise (if `component_value` is not 6 and `component_size` > 1), set `new_value` to the original `component_value`.\n8.  Iterate through all cell coordinates `(cell_r, cell_c)` stored in `current_component_cells` and update the `output_grid[cell_r][cell_c]` with the calculated `new_value`.\n9.  After iterating through all cells in the input grid, the `output_grid` contains the final transformed result. Return the `output_grid`."
