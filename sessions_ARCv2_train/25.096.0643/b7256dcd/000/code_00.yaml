elements:
  - element: Grid
    properties:
      - rows: integer
      - columns: integer
      - cells: list of list of integers
  - element: Cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - row_index: integer
      - column_index: integer
      - is_background: boolean (true if value is 7)
  - element: Component
    properties:
      - cells: list of Cell objects
      - value: integer (the common value of cells in the component, must not be 7)
      - size: integer (number of cells in the component)
      - connectivity: 4-directional (horizontal and vertical adjacency)

actions:
  - action: Identify Components
    description: Scan the input grid to find connected regions of cells sharing the same non-7 value. Use 4-directional adjacency.
    inputs:
      - input_grid: Grid
    outputs:
      - components: list of Component objects

  - action: Transform Component
    description: Apply a specific value transformation to all cells within a component based on its original value and size.
    inputs:
      - component: Component
    outputs:
      - new_value: integer

transformation_rules:
  - rule: Background Preservation
    condition: Cell value is 7.
    action: Keep cell value as 7 in the output.
  - rule: Isolated Non-6 Transformation
    condition: Component size is 1 AND component value is NOT 6.
    action: Change the value of the component's cell to 7.
  - rule: Size-Based Transformation for Value 6
    condition: Component value IS 6.
    sub_rules:
      - condition: Component size is 1.
        action: Keep the value 6.
      - condition: Component size is 2.
        action: Change the value of the component's cells to 3.
      - condition: Component size is 3.
        action: Keep the value 6.
      - condition: Component size is 4.
        action: Change the value of the component's cells to 1.
      - condition: Component size is 5.
        action: Change the value of the component's cells to 4.
      # Note: Assumes no other sizes for value 6 components appear or they remain unchanged.
  - rule: Default Component Preservation
    condition: Applies if no other rule matches a component (e.g., non-6 component with size > 1).
    action: Keep the original value of the component's cells. (Though not observed in examples).

relationships:
  - relationship: Adjacency
    description: Cells are adjacent if they share an edge (horizontally or vertically).
  - relationship: Component Membership
    description: A cell belongs to a component if it shares the same non-7 value as other cells in the component and is connected to them through a path of adjacent cells with that same value.
