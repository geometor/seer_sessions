task: Grid Transformation with Row Manipulation and Tiling

input_elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: N rows, M columns (variable)
      - colors: Contains a background color (consistently 0) and exactly one non-zero foreground color.

output_elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: 2*N rows, 2*M columns (derived from input)

transformation_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: identify_colors
    input: input grid
    outputs:
      - background_color: integer (value is 0)
      - foreground_color: integer (the unique non-zero value)
    details: Scan the input grid to find the unique non-zero integer.

  - step: 2
    action: create_intermediate_grid
    input:
      - input grid
      - background_color
      - foreground_color
    output: intermediate grid (T)
    properties:
       - dimensions: N rows, M columns (same as input)
    details:
      - Initialize T as an N x M grid.
      - If N < 2, T is a copy of the input grid.
      - If N >= 2:
        - Row 1 of T is set to Row 2 of the input grid.
        - Row 2 of T is set to Row 1 of the input grid.
        - For each subsequent row index `i` (from 2 up to N-1):
          - Get Row `i+1` from the input grid.
          - Create Row `i+1` for T by iterating through the input row's elements:
            - If an element equals `background_color`, replace it with `foreground_color`.
            - If an element equals `foreground_color`, replace it with `background_color`.
          - Assign the transformed row to Row `i+1` of T.

  - step: 3
    action: tile_grid
    input: intermediate grid (T)
    output: final output grid
    details:
      - Create the final output grid with dimensions (2*N) x (2*M).
      - Tile the intermediate grid T twice horizontally and twice vertically to fill the output grid.
      - The output grid is composed of four copies of T arranged as:
          T T
          T T

relationships:
  - Output grid dimensions are double the input grid dimensions.
  - The output grid is a 2x2 tiling of the intermediate grid T.
  - The intermediate grid T is derived from the input grid by swapping the first two rows and applying a color-swap transformation (background <-> foreground) to all subsequent rows (rows 3 to N).
