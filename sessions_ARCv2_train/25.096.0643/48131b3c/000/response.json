For an input of N rows and M columns, the output is 2N rows and 2M columns.\n4.  **Pattern Repetition:** The output grid appears to be constructed by repeating a smaller pattern four times, arranged in a 2x2 configuration.\n5.  **Core Transformation:** The repeated pattern in the output is not identical to the input grid but seems closely related. Comparing the input rows to the rows within one quadrant of the output suggests a rearrangement of the input rows. Specifically, the first two rows of the input grid appear to be swapped in the repeating pattern, while any subsequent rows retain their original relative order.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```"
