Even-indexed rows (0, 2, ...) seem unchanged, while odd-indexed rows (1, 3, ...) are modified.\n    *   In the odd-indexed rows, the elements undergo a specific rearrangement. Comparing the input and output for these rows suggests a circular shift. Specifically, it looks like a right circular shift by one position: the last element moves to the first position, and all other elements shift one position to the right. Let's re-verify:\n        *   Train 1, Row 1: `[7, 8, 3, 7]` -> `[7, 7, 8, 3]` (Right shift: last element `7` moves to front, `7, 8, 3` shift right -> `[7, 7, 8, 3]`. Correct.)\n        *   Train 2, Row 1: `[5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]` -> `[7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7]` (Right shift: last element `7` moves to front, `5, 0, 7, 7, 7` shift right -> `[7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7]`. Correct.)\n    *   The transformation rule is consistent across both examples.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
