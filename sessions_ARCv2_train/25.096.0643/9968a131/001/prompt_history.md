*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are 2D grids (matrices) of integers.
    *   The transformation preserves the dimensions of the grid.
    *   The transformation appears to operate independently on each row.
    *   A distinction is made between rows based on their index (position). Even-indexed rows (0, 2, ...) seem unchanged, while odd-indexed rows (1, 3, ...) are modified.
    *   In the odd-indexed rows, the elements undergo a specific rearrangement. Comparing the input and output for these rows suggests a circular shift. Specifically, it looks like a right circular shift by one position: the last element moves to the first position, and all other elements shift one position to the right. Let's re-verify:
        *   Train 1, Row 1: `[7, 8, 3, 7]` -> `[7, 7, 8, 3]` (Right shift: last element `7` moves to front, `7, 8, 3` shift right -> `[7, 7, 8, 3]`. Correct.)
        *   Train 2, Row 1: `[5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]` -> `[7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7]` (Right shift: last element `7` moves to front, `5, 0, 7, 7, 7` shift right -> `[7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7]`. Correct.)
    *   The transformation rule is consistent across both examples.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - object: grid
        description: A 2D array of integers representing the input and output.
        properties:
          - rows: A list of rows.
          - dimensions: height (number of rows) and width (number of columns).
      - object: row
        description: A 1D array (list) of integers within the grid.
        properties:
          - index: The 0-based position of the row within the grid (0, 1, 2, ...).
          - elements: The list of integer values in the row.
          - parity: Whether the row index is even or odd.
      - object: element
        description: An integer value within a row.
        properties:
          - value: The integer number.
          - position: The 0-based index within the row.
    actions:
      - name: process_grid
        input: input_grid
        output: output_grid
        steps:
          - Iterate through each row of the input_grid, keeping track of the row_index.
          - Check the parity of the row_index.
          - If row_index is even: Copy the row directly to the output_grid at the same row_index.
          - If row_index is odd: Perform a right circular shift on the elements of the row and place the result in the output_grid at the same row_index.
      - name: right_circular_shift
        input: row_elements (list of integers)
        output: shifted_row_elements (list of integers)
        description: Moves the last element to the first position and shifts all other elements one position to the right.
        example: [a, b, c, d] -> [d, a, b, c]
    relationships:
      - The transformation of a row depends on its index (parity).
      - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, along with its row index (starting from 0).
    3.  For each row:
        a.  Check if the row index is odd (e.g., 1, 3, 5, ...).
        b.  If the row index is odd:
            i.  Perform a right circular shift on the elements of the current row by one position. (Take the last element and move it to the beginning, shifting all other elements one step to the right).
            ii. Place this shifted row into the corresponding row index of the output grid.
        c.  If the row index is even (e.g., 0, 2, 4, ...):
            i.  Copy the current row directly from the input grid.
            ii. Place this original row into the corresponding row index of the output grid.
    4.  Return the completed output grid.
