The output uses colors 0 and 3. Color 2 from the input seems to be disregarded or treated the same as 3 in terms of determining *where* things happen, but the *output* color is consistently 3 for the drawn shapes.\n3.  **Transformation Nature:** The transformation involves scaling and pattern placement. It's not a simple cell-by-cell mapping or a standard image processing filter. It identifies features in the input (locations of non-zero cells) and uses them to place larger, predefined shapes in the output.\n4.  **Key Feature:** The core logic seems dependent on the spatial extent of the non-zero cells in the input, specifically the top-leftmost non-zero cell.\n5.  **Output Structure:** The output consists of a background color (0) and two distinct, non-overlapping 4x4 squares filled with color 3. The position of these squares is determined by the input.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Scan the input 3x3 grid to find all cells containing a value other than 0.\n3.  Keep track of the row and column indices for each non-zero cell found.\n4.  If no non-zero cells are found, return the 0-filled 9x9 grid.\n5.  If non-zero cells exist, find the minimum row index (`min_r`) and the minimum column index (`min_c`) among them. This pair `(min_r, min_c)` represents the coordinates of the top-leftmost non-zero cell.\n6.  Calculate the top-left coordinate for the first 4x4 square: `(row1, col1) = (min_r, min_c)`.\n7.  Calculate the top-left coordinate for the second 4x4 square: `(row2, col2) = (min_r + 4, min_c + 4)`.\n8.  Fill the 4x4 block of cells in the target grid starting at `(row1, col1)` with the value 3. This modifies cells from row `row1` to `row1 + 3` and column `col1` to `col1 + 3`.\n9.  Fill the 4x4 block of cells in the target grid starting at `(row2, col2)` with the value 3. This modifies cells from row `row2` to `row2 + 3` and column `col2` to `col2 + 3`.\n10. Return the final 9x9 target grid."
