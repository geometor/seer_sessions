task_type: grid_transformation
input_grid:
  properties:
    size: 3x3
    cell_values: [0, 2, 3] # Observed values
    purpose: Defines placement parameters for output shapes based on non-zero cell locations.
output_grid:
  properties:
    size: 9x9
    cell_values: [0, 3] # Observed values
    background_color: 0
    purpose: Displays shapes based on input parameters.
transformation:
  actions:
    - Identify non-zero cells in the input grid.
    - Determine the minimum row (min_r) and minimum column (min_c) coordinates among non-zero cells.
    - Initialize a 9x9 grid with the background color (0).
    - Draw two shapes onto the output grid.
  shapes:
    - type: square
      size: 4x4
      color: 3
      count: 2
  placement_rules:
    - square_1_top_left: (min_r, min_c)
    - square_2_top_left: (min_r + 4, min_c + 4)
  relationships:
    - The location of the top-leftmost non-zero input cell dictates the absolute position of both output squares.
    - The specific values (2 or 3) of non-zero input cells do not affect the output color (always 3) or shape size (always 4x4), only their presence matters for determining min_r and min_c.
    - The two output squares have a fixed relative position (offset by +4 rows, +4 columns).
