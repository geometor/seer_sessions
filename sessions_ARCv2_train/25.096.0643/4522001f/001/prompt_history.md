Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The task takes a 3x3 grid of integers as input and produces a 9x9 grid of integers as output.
2.  **Color Palette:** The input uses colors (integers) 0, 2, and 3. The output uses colors 0 and 3. Color 2 from the input seems to be disregarded or treated the same as 3 in terms of determining *where* things happen, but the *output* color is consistently 3 for the drawn shapes.
3.  **Transformation Nature:** The transformation involves scaling and pattern placement. It's not a simple cell-by-cell mapping or a standard image processing filter. It identifies features in the input (locations of non-zero cells) and uses them to place larger, predefined shapes in the output.
4.  **Key Feature:** The core logic seems dependent on the spatial extent of the non-zero cells in the input, specifically the top-leftmost non-zero cell.
5.  **Output Structure:** The output consists of a background color (0) and two distinct, non-overlapping 4x4 squares filled with color 3. The position of these squares is determined by the input.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
input_grid:
  properties:
    size: 3x3
    cell_values: [0, 2, 3] # Observed values
    purpose: Defines placement parameters for output shapes based on non-zero cell locations.
output_grid:
  properties:
    size: 9x9
    cell_values: [0, 3] # Observed values
    background_color: 0
    purpose: Displays shapes based on input parameters.
transformation:
  actions:
    - Identify non-zero cells in the input grid.
    - Determine the minimum row (min_r) and minimum column (min_c) coordinates among non-zero cells.
    - Initialize a 9x9 grid with the background color (0).
    - Draw two shapes onto the output grid.
  shapes:
    - type: square
      size: 4x4
      color: 3
      count: 2
  placement_rules:
    - square_1_top_left: (min_r, min_c)
    - square_2_top_left: (min_r + 4, min_c + 4)
  relationships:
    - The location of the top-leftmost non-zero input cell dictates the absolute position of both output squares.
    - The specific values (2 or 3) of non-zero input cells do not affect the output color (always 3) or shape size (always 4x4), only their presence matters for determining min_r and min_c.
    - The two output squares have a fixed relative position (offset by +4 rows, +4 columns).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a target 9x9 grid and fill it entirely with the value 0.
2.  Scan the input 3x3 grid to find all cells containing a value other than 0.
3.  Keep track of the row and column indices for each non-zero cell found.
4.  If no non-zero cells are found, return the 0-filled 9x9 grid.
5.  If non-zero cells exist, find the minimum row index (`min_r`) and the minimum column index (`min_c`) among them. This pair `(min_r, min_c)` represents the coordinates of the top-leftmost non-zero cell.
6.  Calculate the top-left coordinate for the first 4x4 square: `(row1, col1) = (min_r, min_c)`.
7.  Calculate the top-left coordinate for the second 4x4 square: `(row2, col2) = (min_r + 4, min_c + 4)`.
8.  Fill the 4x4 block of cells in the target grid starting at `(row1, col1)` with the value 3. This modifies cells from row `row1` to `row1 + 3` and column `col1` to `col1 + 3`.
9.  Fill the 4x4 block of cells in the target grid starting at `(row2, col2)` with the value 3. This modifies cells from row `row2` to `row2 + 3` and column `col2` to `col2 + 3`.
10. Return the final 9x9 target grid.
