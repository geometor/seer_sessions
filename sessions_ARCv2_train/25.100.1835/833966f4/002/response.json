            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous attempt correctly identified that the transformation involves rearranging elements within the sequence but misinterpreted the specific swapping pattern. The initial hypothesis assumed a simple adjacent pairwise swap iterating from the beginning (`(0,1)`, `(2,3)`, etc.). However, the results show this leads to incorrect outputs, particularly affecting elements after the first pair in sequences of length greater than 3.\n\nThe analysis of the failed examples reveals a different pattern: the swap occurs specifically for the first pair (indices 0 and 1) and the last pair (indices `n-2` and `n-1`), where `n` is the length of the sequence. If the sequence has an odd number of elements, the middle element (at index `n // 2`) remains untouched relative to these swaps. This revised hypothesis successfully explains both training examples.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  Modify the transformation logic to implement the newly identified pattern:\n    *   Swap elements at index 0 and 1.\n    *   If the sequence length `n` is greater than 2, swap elements at index `n-2` and `n-1`.\n2.  Update the Natural Language Program and Facts documentation to reflect this refined understanding.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's analyze the differences between the expected output and the output generated by the previous code (`code_00.py`).\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[9, 0, 1, 6, 8]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[0, 9, 1, 8, 6]`\n    *   `code_00.py` Output: `[0, 9, 6, 1, 8]`\n    *   Difference: Elements at index 2 and 3 are swapped incorrectly (`1, 8` vs `6, 1`). The element at index 4 is also misplaced relative to the expected output.\n    *   Number of misplaced elements: 3 (at indices 2, 3, 4).\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[4, 3, 6, 2, 8]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[3, 4, 6, 8, 2]`\n    *   `code_00.py` Output: `[3, 4, 2, 6, 8]`\n    *   Difference: Elements at index 2 and 3 are swapped incorrectly (`6, 8` vs `2, 6`). The element at index 4 is also misplaced relative to the expected output.\n    *   Number of misplaced elements: 3 (at indices 2, 3, 4).\n\nThe metrics provided (`Pixels Off: 3`) align with the observation that three elements end up in incorrect positions in both examples when using the simple adjacent pairwise swap logic.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
