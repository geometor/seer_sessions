"""
Transforms the input sequence by swapping adjacent pairs of elements.

The input is treated as a 1D sequence of integers. The transformation iterates 
through the sequence, taking elements at indices (0, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5), etc. 
For each pair of indices (i, i+1) considered, if both indices are valid within 
the sequence bounds, the elements at these positions are swapped. If the sequence 
has an odd number of elements, the last element remains in its position as it 
does not form a complete pair starting from index 0 with a step of 2.

Note: This implementation follows the natural language description. However, 
for train_1 ([9, 0, 1, 6, 8]), this logic produces [0, 9, 6, 1, 8], 
whereas the example output is [0, 9, 1, 8, 6]. This suggests a potential 
discrepancy between the example and the derived rule. The code implements 
the derived rule (standard adjacent pairwise swap).
