Task: Reorder sequence elements

Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      type: List[int]
      description: A vertical sequence of single-digit integers.
  - OutputSequence:
      type: List[int]
      description: A vertical sequence of single-digit integers derived from the input.
  - Element:
      type: int
      description: A single-digit integer within the sequence.
  - Pair:
      type: Tuple[int, int]
      description: Two adjacent elements in the sequence, identified by indices (i, i+1).

Properties:
  - InputSequence.length: The number of elements in the input.
  - OutputSequence.length: The number of elements in the output.
  - Relationship: InputSequence.length == OutputSequence.length
  - Relationship: The set of elements in InputSequence is the same as the set of elements in OutputSequence.

Actions:
  - Iterate: Process the InputSequence based on element index.
  - IdentifyPairs: Group elements into adjacent pairs starting from index 0 (e.g., index 0 & 1, index 2 & 3, ...).
  - Swap: Exchange the positions of the two elements within an identified pair.

Relationships:
  - The OutputSequence is generated by applying the Swap action to identified adjacent Pairs in the InputSequence.
  - Pairs are formed starting from the beginning of the sequence (index 0).
  - If the InputSequence has an odd length, the final element is not part of a pair and is not swapped, remaining in its relative position after preceding swaps.
