The output is also a sequence of single-digit integers, again presented vertically. The number of integers in the output sequence is identical to the number in the input sequence. The specific integers present in the output are the same as those in the input, indicating that the transformation involves rearranging the order of the input integers, not changing their values or adding/removing any.\n\nObserving the examples:\n*   In `train_1`, the input `[9, 0, 1, 6, 8]` becomes `[0, 9, 1, 8, 6]`. The first pair (9, 0) is swapped to (0, 9). The middle element (1) remains in place. The last pair (6, 8) is swapped to (8, 6).\n*   In `train_2`, the input `[4, 3, 6, 2, 8]` becomes `[3, 4, 6, 8, 2]`. The first pair (4, 3) is swapped to (3, 4). The middle element (6) remains in place. The last pair (2, 8) is swapped to (8, 2).\n\nThe pattern appears to be swapping adjacent pairs of elements. We take elements at indices (0, 1) and swap them, then take elements at indices (2, 3) and swap them, and so on. If there's an odd number of elements, the last element remains in its original position relative to the swaps performed before it.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
