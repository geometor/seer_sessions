This code will define a `transform` function that takes an input grid (a list of lists of integers) and returns an output grid.\n2.  **Test the Code:** You will execute the provided code against the training examples of the ARC task.  This includes:\n    *   Running the `transform` function with the input grid.\n    *   Comparing the transformed output with the expected output grid.\n    *   Handling any errors (syntax errors, runtime exceptions).\n    *   Capturing any print statements (standard output) from the code.\n3.  **Analyze Results:**  You will analyze the test results, identifying:\n    *   Successful transformations (where the output matches the expected output).\n    *   Failed transformations (where the output does not match).\n    *   Specific errors encountered during execution.\n4.  **Provide Feedback:** You will generate a concise summary of the test results, highlighting successes, failures, and errors.\n5.  **Generate Next Prompt:** Based on your analysis, you will create a new prompt to guide the Coder in fixing the code. This prompt should include:\n    *   A summary of the analysis.\n    *   The previous prompt that generated the code.\n    *   Clear instructions for improvement.\n\nYou are a crucial part of an iterative process, helping the Coder converge on a correct solution.

  "task_context_content": "# TASK\n\nOur tasks are from ARC-AGI (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus)\nEach task contains a set input-output examples.\nSEER will analyze the examples to derive a natural language description of the\ncontext and transformations, then use this to develop a python function to\nperform the transformation.\nWe will verify the function on all the example input-output pairs, if\nsuccessful, we will use the function to transform the test input into the final\noutput. \n\nARC inputs and outputs are grids (2d arrays) where each cell is a value of\nthe integers 0-9.\nA grid can be any height or width between 1 x 1 and 30 x 30.\nGrid values represent colors using this mapping:\n\n```\nCOLOR_MAP = {\n    0: (238, 238, 238),  # white\n    1: (30, 147, 255),  # blue\n    2: (220, 50, 40),  # red\n    3: (79, 204, 48),  # green\n    4: (230, 200, 0),  # yellow\n    5: (85, 85, 85),  # gray\n    6: (229, 58, 163),  # magenta\n    7: (230, 120, 20),  # orange\n    8: (135, 216, 241),  # azure\n    9: (146, 18, 49),  # maroon\n}\n```\n\nWe will refer to cells as pixels.\nUse the color name when referring to the value.\n\n# Priors\nARC-AGI is explicitly designed to compare artificial intelligence with human\nintelligence. To do this, ARC-AGI explicitly lists the priors knowledge human\nhave to provide a fair ground for comparing AI systems. These core knowledge\npriors are ones that humans naturally possess, even in childhood.\n\n## Objectness\n- Objects persist and cannot appear or disappear without reason. \n- An object can be considered a contiguous block of one or more pixels of the same color.\n- Objects can interact or not depending on the circumstances.\n\n## Goal-directedness\n- Objects can be animate or inanimate.\n- Some objects are \"agents\" - they have intentions and they pursue goals.  \n\n## Numbers & counting\n- Objects can be counted or sorted by their shape, appearance, or movement using\n  basic mathematics like addition, subtraction, and comparison.\n\n## Basic geometry & topology\n- Objects can be shapes like rectangles, triangles, and circles which can be\n  mirrored, rotated, translated, deformed, combined, repeated, etc. Differences\n  in distances can be detected.\n- Adjacency is very important - side by side and diagonal\n\nARC-AGI avoids a reliance on any information that isn't part of these priors,\nfor example acquired or cultural knowledge, like language."
