**General Assessment:**

The second attempt (code_01) used a rule based on adjacent '7's within the reachable region `R` to determine which '7's should be preserved. The results show this was also incorrect, preserving far too many '7's compared to the expected output (14 errors in Ex1, 8 in Ex2). The core issue remains the accurate identification of the "hole" preservation rule.

The analysis suggests that both previous attempts (2x2 block check on input, adjacent '7' check) failed to capture the specific conditions under which a '7' within the reachable region `R` remains a '7'.

A new hypothesis is proposed:
1. Identify the reachable region `R` from '3's, avoiding '8's.
2. Initialize the output grid from the input.
3. Iterate through the grid. For each cell `(r, c)` that is originally '7' and within `R`:
    a. Tentatively change its value to '3' in the output grid.
    b. Check if this change *completes* a 2x2 block of '3's ending at `(r, c)` (i.e., `output[r-1:r+1, c-1:c+1]` are all '3's), **AND** if the corresponding 2x2 block in the *input* grid contained only non-'8' values, **AND** if all four cells of the block belong to region `R`.
    c. If all these conditions (2x2 of '3's created in output, valid input block, all in R) are met, revert the change, setting `output[r][c]` back to '7'.

This revised hypothesis focuses on preventing the formation of specific 2x2 blocks of '3's during the transformation process.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Boundaries and Sources:** Locate all cells with value '8' (boundaries) and value '3' (sources) in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Reachable Region (R):** Find the set `R` containing all grid cells `(r, c)` that satisfy:
    *   The input value `input_grid[r][c]` is not '8'.
    *   There exists a path from at least one source '3' cell to `(r, c)` consisting only of adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) whose input values are not '8'. Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all source '3' cells.
3.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create an output grid, making a deep copy of the input grid.
4.  **Apply Transformation with Hole Prevention:** Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the grid (e.g., row by row, column by column).
    a.  Check if the current cell `(r, c)` is within the determined region `R` *and* its value in the input grid `input_grid[r][c]` is '7'.
    b.  If both conditions in (a) are true:
        i.  Tentatively set the corresponding cell in the output grid to '3': `output_grid[r][c] = 3`.
        ii. Check if this change *completed* a "forbidden" 2x2 block ending at `(r, c)`. A block is forbidden if:
            *   The cell is not in the first row or first column (`r > 0` and `c > 0`).
            *   All four cells forming the 2x2 block ending at `(r, c)` in the **output grid** now have the value '3' (i.e., `output_grid[r-1][c-1]`, `output_grid[r-1][c]`, `output_grid[r][c-1]`, and `output_grid[r][c]` are all '3').
            *   All four corresponding cells in the **input grid** had non-'8' values.
            *   All four corresponding cells belong to the region `R`.
        iii. If all conditions for a forbidden 2x2 block are met, revert the change: set `output_grid[r][c]` back to '7'.
5.  **Finalize Output:** The output grid, after iterating through all cells and applying the tentative fill and potential reversion, is the final result. Cells not modified in step 4 retain their initial values from the input grid (handled by the initial deep copy).
