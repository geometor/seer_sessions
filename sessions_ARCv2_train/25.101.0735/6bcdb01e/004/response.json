            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe second attempt (code_01) used a rule based on adjacent '7's within the reachable region `R` to determine which '7's should be preserved. The results show this was also incorrect, preserving far too many '7's compared to the expected output (14 errors in Ex1, 8 in Ex2). The core issue remains the accurate identification of the \"hole\" preservation rule.\n\nThe analysis suggests that both previous attempts (2x2 block check on input, adjacent '7' check) failed to capture the specific conditions under which a '7' within the reachable region `R` remains a '7'.\n\nA new hypothesis is proposed:\n1. Identify the reachable region `R` from '3's, avoiding '8's.\n2. Initialize the output grid from the input.\n3. Iterate through the grid. For each cell `(r, c)` that is originally '7' and within `R`:\n    a. Tentatively change its value to '3' in the output grid.\n    b. Check if this change *completes* a 2x2 block of '3's ending at `(r, c)` (i.e., `output[r-1:r+1, c-1:c+1]` are all '3's), **AND** if the corresponding 2x2 block in the *input* grid contained only non-'8' values, **AND** if all four cells of the block belong to region `R`.\n    c. If all these conditions (2x2 of '3's created in output, valid input block, all in R) are met, revert the change, setting `output[r][c]` back to '7'.\n\nThis revised hypothesis focuses on preventing the formation of specific 2x2 blocks of '3's during the transformation process.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nMetrics for the code_01 attempt (adjacent '7' rule):\n"
