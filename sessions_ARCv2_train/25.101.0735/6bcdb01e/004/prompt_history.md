**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** Both input and output are grids (matrices) of single-digit integers.
2.  **Grid Size:** The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged from input to output (7x7 for `train_1`, 5x5 for `train_2`).
3.  **Values:** The grids contain primarily the digits 3, 7, and 8.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to involve changing some '7' cells to '3' cells. The '8' cells and the initial '3' cells seem to act as constraints or starting points.
5.  **Role of Numbers:**
    *   `8`: Acts as an impenetrable boundary or wall. These cells never change value.
    *   `3`: Acts as a starting "seed" or source for a change. Input '3's generally remain '3' or are part of a larger '3' region in the output.
    *   `7`: Represents a "fillable" or potentially changeable state. Some '7's are changed to '3's based on their relationship to the initial '3's and the '8' boundaries.
6.  **Pattern:** The change seems related to connectivity. A connected region is formed based on the initial '3's and the fillable '7's, bounded by the '8's. Cells within this region are potentially changed to '3'. However, not all '7's within this connected region change; some remain '7', forming "holes" or unchanged areas within the affected region.

**YAML Facts:**

    condition: The exact condition for changing a '7' to a '3' within the component is complex and seems to depend on the cell's position relative to boundaries and potentially other cells within the component, leaving some '7's unchanged ("holes").

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid. Create an output grid, initially identical to the input.
2.  Identify all cells in the input grid that contain the value '8'. These are immutable walls. The corresponding cells in the output grid will also be '8'.
3.  Identify all cells in the input grid that contain the value '3'. These are the "source" cells.
4.  Determine the connected region `R` consisting of all non-'8' cells that are reachable from at least one source '3' cell by moving only through adjacent non-'8' cells.
5.  Modify the output grid based on region `R`:
    a.  For any cell `(r, c)` that is *not* in region `R`, its value in the output grid remains the same as its input value (it will be either an '8' or a '7' that wasn't reachable from a '3').
    b.  For any cell `(r, c)` that *is* in region `R`:
        i.  If the input value `input[r][c]` was '3', the output value `output[r][c]` is '3'.
        ii. If the input value `input[r][c]` was '7', apply a specific rule to determine if the output should be '3' or remain '7'. This rule appears to change most '7's in `R` to '3', but preserves certain '7's as '7' (creating "holes"), potentially based on their local neighbourhood configuration or distance from the region's boundary (further investigation needed to specify the exact rule for these exceptions). A likely candidate rule is that a '7' remains '7' only if it is sufficiently "interior" within the region R, meaning it's not adjacent to any '8' wall or grid boundary, although the precise definition might be more complex. All other '7's in R become '3'.

**General Assessment:**

The provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying a connected region `R` reachable from initial '3' cells (avoiding '8' walls) and then changing most '7's within this region to '3's. It incorporates a specific rule to preserve some '7's as "holes", based on whether they form the bottom-right corner of a 2x2 block of non-'8' cells entirely contained within `R`.

The comparison between the transformed output and the expected output reveals significant discrepancies (17 errors in Example 1, 7 errors in Example 2). The code correctly identifies the intended 'holes' in some cases (`(2,4)`, `(4,4)` in Ex1; `(2,2)` in Ex2) but incorrectly preserves other '7's that should have become '3' (e.g., `(2,5)`, `(3,5)` in Ex1 based on trace). It also incorrectly changes some '7's near the region boundary or adjacent to '8's to '3' when they should have remained '7' (e.g., `(2,0)`, `(2,1)`, `(2,2)` in Ex1).

This indicates that the rule for identifying "holes" (cells that remain '7' within the connected region) is not accurately captured by the current 2x2 block condition. The rule is likely more complex or subtly different. The overall strategy of finding a connected region `R` and modifying '7's within it seems correct, but the precise condition for modification vs. preservation needs refinement.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Verify Region R:** Double-check the implementation and results of the connected region finding (`find_connected_region`) to ensure it accurately identifies all non-'8' cells reachable from the initial '3's. (Visual inspection suggests it's likely correct, but worth confirming).
2.  **Analyze Hole Characteristics:** Focus on the specific cells that remain '7' in the *expected* output (`(2,4)`, `(4,4)` in Ex1; `(2,2)` in Ex2) versus those '7's within R that *do* change to '3'. Compare their local neighborhoods (beyond just the 2x2 block ending there), their position relative to '8' boundaries, and their position within region R.
3.  **Refine Hole Rule:** Formulate a new hypothesis for the rule that distinguishes 'hole' cells from 'filled' cells within region R, consistent with both examples. This might involve different local patterns (e.g., 3x3), distance from boundaries, or connectivity properties *within* R.
4.  **Update NL Program and Code:** Modify the natural language program and the corresponding code logic to reflect the refined rule.

**Metrics:**

Let's quantify the differences for each example.

    output_value: 7
    condition: |
      The exact condition is complex and not fully determined by the current 2x2 rule.
      The current hypothesis (implemented in the tested code) is:
      A cell (r, c) that was originally '7' and is in R remains '7' IF
      r > 0 and c > 0, AND
      the 2x2 block ending at (r, c) had all non-8 input values, AND
      all 4 cells of this 2x2 block belong to region R.
      However, this rule leads to discrepancies with the expected output, indicating it's incomplete or incorrect.
  - action: preserve_value
    description: Cells retain their input value.
    target:
      - All cells with input value '8'.
      - All cells with input value '3' (within or outside R).
      - All cells with input value '7' that are *not* in region R.
      - Cells identified by the secondary_transformation (hole_preservation) rule.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Boundaries and Sources:** Locate all cells with value '8' (boundaries) and value '3' (sources) in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Reachable Region (R):** Find the set `R` containing all grid cells `(r, c)` that satisfy:
    *   The input value `input[r][c]` is not '8'.
    *   There exists a path from at least one source '3' cell to `(r, c)` consisting only of adjacent cells whose input values are not '8'.
3.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create an output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
4.  **Apply Primary Fill:** Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` in the grid. If `(r, c)` is within the region `R` *and* `input[r][c]` is '7', change the value in the `output_grid[r][c]` to '3'.
5.  **Apply Hole Preservation (Refined Rule Needed):** Identify a specific subset of cells modified in step 4 that should be reverted back to '7'. The precise rule for identifying these "holes" is the main challenge.
    *   **Current Flawed Hypothesis (from code):** A cell `(r, c)` processed in step 4 is reverted to '7' if `r > 0`, `c > 0`, the 2x2 block ending at `(r, c)` (`(r-1,c-1)` to `(r,c)`) contained only non-'8' values in the *input* grid, and all four cells of that block belong to region `R`.
    *   **Observation:** This 2x2 rule correctly identifies some required '7' holes but incorrectly preserves others that should be '3' according to the examples. Therefore, this rule needs significant refinement or replacement.
6.  **Finalize Output:** The output grid contains:
    *   Original '8' values.
    *   Original '3' values (sources).
    *   Original '7' values that were outside region `R`.
    *   Value '3' for cells that were originally '7', inside `R`, and *not* identified as holes by the (correct but currently unknown) preservation rule.
    *   Value '7' for cells identified as holes by the preservation rule (originally '7', inside `R`).

Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

1.  **Identify Boundaries and Sources:** Locate all cells with value '8' (boundaries) and value '3' (sources) in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Reachable Region (R):** Find the set `R` containing all grid cells `(r, c)` that satisfy:
    *   The input value `input_grid[r][c]` is not '8'.
    *   There exists a path from at least one source '3' cell to `(r, c)` consisting only of adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) whose input values are not '8'.
3.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create an output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
4.  **Apply Transformation:** Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` in the grid.
    a.  If the cell `(r, c)` is *not* part of the reachable region `R`, its value in the output grid remains the same as its input value.
    b.  If the cell `(r, c)` *is* part of the reachable region `R`:
        i.  If the input value `input_grid[r][c]` is '3', the output value `output_grid[r][c]` remains '3'.
        ii. If the input value `input_grid[r][c]` is '7', determine the output value based on adjacent cells:
            - Check all 4 adjacent neighbors `(nr, nc)` of `(r, c)`.
            - If *at least one* neighbor `(nr, nc)` exists such that:
                1) It is within the grid boundaries.
                2) Its input value `input_grid[nr][nc]` is '7'.
                3) It is also part of the reachable region `R`.
            - Then, the cell `(r, c)` retains its value '7' in the output grid (it forms part of a "hole" or preserved '7' cluster).
            - Otherwise (if no such adjacent neighbor exists), the cell's value is changed to '3' in the output grid.
5.  **Finalize Output:** The resulting grid after applying these rules is the final output.
