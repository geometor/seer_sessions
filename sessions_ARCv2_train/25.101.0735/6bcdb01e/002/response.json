            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying a connected region `R` reachable from initial '3' cells (avoiding '8' walls) and then changing most '7's within this region to '3's. It incorporates a specific rule to preserve some '7's as \"holes\", based on whether they form the bottom-right corner of a 2x2 block of non-'8' cells entirely contained within `R`.\n\nThe comparison between the transformed output and the expected output reveals significant discrepancies (17 errors in Example 1, 7 errors in Example 2). The code correctly identifies the intended 'holes' in some cases (`(2,4)`, `(4,4)` in Ex1; `(2,2)` in Ex2) but incorrectly preserves other '7's that should have become '3' (e.g., `(2,5)`, `(3,5)` in Ex1 based on trace). It also incorrectly changes some '7's near the region boundary or adjacent to '8's to '3' when they should have remained '7' (e.g., `(2,0)`, `(2,1)`, `(2,2)` in Ex1).\n\nThis indicates that the rule for identifying \"holes\" (cells that remain '7' within the connected region) is not accurately captured by the current 2x2 block condition. The rule is likely more complex or subtly different. The overall strategy of finding a connected region `R` and modifying '7's within it seems correct, but the precise condition for modification vs. preservation needs refinement.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Verify Region R:** Double-check the implementation and results of the connected region finding (`find_connected_region`) to ensure it accurately identifies all non-'8' cells reachable from the initial '3's. (Visual inspection suggests it's likely correct, but worth confirming).\n2.  **Analyze Hole Characteristics:** Focus on the specific cells that remain '7' in the *expected* output (`(2,4)`, `(4,4)` in Ex1; `(2,2)` in Ex2) versus those '7's within R that *do* change to '3'. Compare their local neighborhoods (beyond just the 2x2 block ending there), their position relative to '8' boundaries, and their position within region R.\n3.  **Refine Hole Rule:** Formulate a new hypothesis for the rule that distinguishes 'hole' cells from 'filled' cells within region R, consistent with both examples. This might involve different local patterns (e.g., 3x3), distance from boundaries, or connectivity properties *within* R.\n4.  **Update NL Program and Code:** Modify the natural language program and the corresponding code logic to reflect the refined rule.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's quantify the differences for each example.\n\n"
