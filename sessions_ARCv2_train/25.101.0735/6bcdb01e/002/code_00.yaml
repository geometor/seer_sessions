task_elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: matrix
      - content: single-digit integers (3, 7, 8)
      - size: variable, consistent between input and output
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - value: 3, 7, or 8
      - role:
        - 8: boundary/wall (static, blocks connectivity)
        - 3: seed/source (initiates change, remains 3)
        - 7: fillable/changeable state
relationships:
  - type: connectivity
    description: Cells are connected to their 4 adjacent neighbours (up, down, left, right). Connectivity is blocked by cells with value 8.
  - type: region
    id: R
    description: The set of all non-8 cells reachable from any initial '3' cell via paths of adjacent non-8 cells.
actions:
  - action: identify_region_R
    description: Perform a search (e.g., BFS) starting from all input cells with value '3' to find the connected component R, constrained by '8' cells and grid boundaries.
  - action: primary_transformation
    description: Change the value of all input '7' cells that belong to region R to '3'.
    target: Cells within R with input value 7.
    output_value: 3
  - action: secondary_transformation (hole_preservation)
    description: Revert specific cells within R back to '7' based on a local pattern rule.
    target: A subset of cells modified by the primary_transformation.
    output_value: 7
    condition: |
      The exact condition is complex and not fully determined by the current 2x2 rule.
      The current hypothesis (implemented in the tested code) is:
      A cell (r, c) that was originally '7' and is in R remains '7' IF
      r > 0 and c > 0, AND
      the 2x2 block ending at (r, c) had all non-8 input values, AND
      all 4 cells of this 2x2 block belong to region R.
      However, this rule leads to discrepancies with the expected output, indicating it's incomplete or incorrect.
  - action: preserve_value
    description: Cells retain their input value.
    target:
      - All cells with input value '8'.
      - All cells with input value '3' (within or outside R).
      - All cells with input value '7' that are *not* in region R.
      - Cells identified by the secondary_transformation (hole_preservation) rule.
