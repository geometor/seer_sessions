**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** Both input and output are grids (matrices) of single-digit integers.
2.  **Grid Size:** The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged from input to output (7x7 for `train_1`, 5x5 for `train_2`).
3.  **Values:** The grids contain primarily the digits 3, 7, and 8.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to involve changing some '7' cells to '3' cells. The '8' cells and the initial '3' cells seem to act as constraints or starting points.
5.  **Role of Numbers:**
    *   `8`: Acts as an impenetrable boundary or wall. These cells never change value.
    *   `3`: Acts as a starting "seed" or source for a change. Input '3's generally remain '3' or are part of a larger '3' region in the output.
    *   `7`: Represents a "fillable" or potentially changeable state. Some '7's are changed to '3's based on their relationship to the initial '3's and the '8' boundaries.
6.  **Pattern:** The change seems related to connectivity. A connected region is formed based on the initial '3's and the fillable '7's, bounded by the '8's. Cells within this region are potentially changed to '3'. However, not all '7's within this connected region change; some remain '7', forming "holes" or unchanged areas within the affected region.

**YAML Facts:**

```
yaml
task_elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: matrix
      - content: single-digit integers (3, 7, 8)
      - size: variable (e.g., 7x7, 5x5), consistent between input and output
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - value: 3, 7, or 8
      - role:
        - 8: boundary/wall (static)
        - 3: seed/source (initiates change)
        - 7: fillable/changeable state
relationships:
  - type: connectivity
    description: Cells are connected to their 4 adjacent neighbours (up, down, left, right).
  - type: boundary
    description: Connectivity is blocked by cells with value 8.
actions:
  - action: identify_component
    description: Find the connected component of non-8 cells that includes at least one initial '3' cell.
  - action: modify_value
    description: Change the value of certain '7' cells within the identified component to '3'.
    condition: The exact condition for changing a '7' to a '3' within the component is complex and seems to depend on the cell's position relative to boundaries and potentially other cells within the component, leaving some '7's unchanged ("holes").

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid. Create an output grid, initially identical to the input.
2.  Identify all cells in the input grid that contain the value '8'. These are immutable walls. The corresponding cells in the output grid will also be '8'.
3.  Identify all cells in the input grid that contain the value '3'. These are the "source" cells.
4.  Determine the connected region `R` consisting of all non-'8' cells that are reachable from at least one source '3' cell by moving only through adjacent non-'8' cells.
5.  Modify the output grid based on region `R`:
    a.  For any cell `(r, c)` that is *not* in region `R`, its value in the output grid remains the same as its input value (it will be either an '8' or a '7' that wasn't reachable from a '3').
    b.  For any cell `(r, c)` that *is* in region `R`:
        i.  If the input value `input[r][c]` was '3', the output value `output[r][c]` is '3'.
        ii. If the input value `input[r][c]` was '7', apply a specific rule to determine if the output should be '3' or remain '7'. This rule appears to change most '7's in `R` to '3', but preserves certain '7's as '7' (creating "holes"), potentially based on their local neighbourhood configuration or distance from the region's boundary (further investigation needed to specify the exact rule for these exceptions). A likely candidate rule is that a '7' remains '7' only if it is sufficiently "interior" within the region R, meaning it's not adjacent to any '8' wall or grid boundary, although the precise definition might be more complex. All other '7's in R become '3'.
