            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe latest code (`code_02`) implemented a rule attempting to preserve '7's by preventing the formation of 2x2 blocks of '3's under specific conditions (input block was non-'8' and within the reachable region `R`). This significantly improved the result for Example 2 (down to 4 errors) but still produced 15 errors for Example 1.\n\nAnalysis of the errors reveals two primary issues:\n1.  **Boundary Handling:** The `if r > 0 and c > 0` check inherently prevents the 2x2 rule from applying to cells in the first row or column. The expected output shows some '7's should be preserved even near boundaries (e.g., `(1,0)`, `(2,0)`, `(4,0)`, `(6,0)` in Ex1; `(2,0)`, `(4,0)`, `(0,2)`, `(2,4)` in Ex2). The current rule incorrectly converts these to '3'.\n2.  **Incorrect Reversions:** The rule seems to be reverting some cells back to '7' when they should remain '3' (e.g., `(3,1)`, `(3,2)`, `(3,3)`, `(3,4)`, `(3,5)`, `(5,2)`, `(4,3)` in Ex1). This suggests the condition for reverting (forming a 2x2 block of 3s in the output) might be too broad or interacting unexpectedly due to the single-pass processing order.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\nAdopt a two-pass approach to decouple the initial fill from the hole preservation:\n1.  **Pass 1 (Initial Fill):** Determine region `R`. Create an intermediate grid where all '7's within `R` are changed to '3'. All other cells (original '3's, '8's, '7's outside R) retain their input values.\n2.  **Pass 2 (Hole Identification):** Create the final output grid, initially copying the intermediate grid. Iterate through the *intermediate* grid. For each cell `(r, c)` that corresponds to an *original* '7' within region `R`, check if it forms the bottom-right corner of a 2x2 block that meets the criteria *based on the intermediate grid and input conditions*. If the conditions are met, revert the value in the *final output grid* at `(r, c)` to '7'.\n\nThis ensures the 2x2 check operates on a consistent state (the fully filled intermediate grid) and avoids order-dependent issues. The boundary condition `r > 0 and c > 0` needs to be applied correctly within this check.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nMetrics for the `code_02` attempt (prevent 2x2 block of 3s):\n\n*code_execution:*\n"
