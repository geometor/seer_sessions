Identify Boundaries and Sources: Locate all cells with value '8' (boundaries) and value '3' (sources) in the input grid.\n2.  Determine Reachable Region (R): Find the set `R` containing all grid cells `(r, c)` that satisfy:\n    *   The input value `input_grid[r][c]` is not '8'.\n    *   There exists a path from at least one source '3' cell to `(r, c)` consisting only of adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) whose input values are not '8'. Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all source '3' cells.\n3.  Initialize Output Grid: Create an output grid, making a deep copy of the input grid.\n4.  Apply Transformation with Hole Prevention: Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the grid (e.g., row by row, column by column).\n    a.  Check if the current cell `(r, c)` is within the determined region `R` *and* its value in the input grid `input_grid[r][c]` is '7'.\n    b.  If both conditions in (a) are true:\n        i.  Tentatively set the corresponding cell in the output grid to '3': `output_grid[r][c] = 3`.\n        ii. Check if this change *completed* a \"forbidden\" 2x2 block ending at `(r, c)`. A block is forbidden if:\n            *   The cell is not in the first row or first column (`r > 0` and `c > 0`).\n            *   All four cells forming the 2x2 block ending at `(r, c)` in the **output grid** now have the value '3' (i.e., `output_grid[r-1][c-1]`, `output_grid[r-1][c]`, `output_grid[r][c-1]`, and `output_grid[r][c]` are all '3').\n            *   All four corresponding cells in the **input grid** had non-'8' values.\n            *   All four corresponding cells belong to the region `R`.\n        iii. If all conditions for a forbidden 2x2 block are met, revert the change: set `output_grid[r][c]` back to '7'.\n5.  Finalize Output: The output grid, after iterating through all cells and applying the tentative fill and potential reversion, is the final result. Cells not modified in step 4 retain their initial values from the input grid (handled by the initial deep copy).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport copy\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_connected_region(grid: list[list[int]], sources: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> set[tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the connected region of non-8 cells reachable from source cells using BFS.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input grid.\n        sources: A list of (row, col) tuples representing the starting '3' cells.\n\n    Returns:\n        A set of (row, col) tuples representing the connected region R.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    region_r = set()\n    queue = deque()\n    visited = set()\n\n    # Initialize queue and visited set with sources that are not '8'\n    for r, c in sources:\n        if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols and grid[r][c] != 8:\n            if (r, c) not in visited:\n                visited.add((r, c))\n                queue.append((r, c))\n                # Add sources to region R immediately if they are valid\n                region_r.add((r, c))\n\n    # BFS to find all reachable non-8 cells\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        # No need to add here, added when dequeued if source or when added to queue\n\n        # Explore neighbors (up, down, left, right)\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n\n            # Check bounds\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                # Check if neighbor is not visited and not an '8' wall\n                if (nr, nc) not in visited and grid[nr][nc] != 8:\n                    visited.add((nr, nc))\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n                    # Add valid neighbors to region R as they are found\n                    region_r.add((nr, nc))\n                    \n    return region_r\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    if rows == 0:\n        return []\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n    if cols == 0:\n        return [[] for _ in range(rows)]\n\n    # initialize output_grid as a deep copy of input_grid\n    output_grid = copy.deepcopy(input_grid)\n\n    # Find initial '3' source cells\n    sources = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r][c] == 3:\n                sources.append((r, c))\n\n    # Determine the connected region R reachable from sources, avoiding '8's\n    region_r = find_connected_region(input_grid, sources)\n\n    # Iterate through the grid and apply transformation rules\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Consider only cells that are originally '7' and within the reachable region R\n            if input_grid[r][c] == 7 and (r, c) in region_r:\n                # Tentatively change the cell to '3' in the output\n                output_grid[r][c] = 3\n\n                # Check for the 2x2 hole condition (preventing 2x2 blocks of 3s under certain conditions)\n                is_hole = False\n                if r > 0 and c > 0:\n                    # Coordinates of the 2x2 block ending at (r, c)\n                    tl, tc, bl, br = (r -
