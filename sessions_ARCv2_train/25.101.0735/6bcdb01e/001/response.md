Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

1.  Identify the connected region `R` of all non-'8' cells reachable from any initial '3' cell by moving only through adjacent non-'8' cells (up, down, left, right).
2.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` in the grid.
4.  If the cell `(r, c)` belongs to the identified region `R` and its value in the input grid is '7':
    a. Check if the 2x2 block ending at `(r, c)` (i.e., cells `(r-1, c-1)`, `(r-1, c)`, `(r, c-1)`, and `(r, c)`) satisfies the following conditions:
        i.   The cell is not in the first row or first column (`r > 0` and `c > 0`).
        ii.  All four cells in the 2x2 block had non-'8' values in the input grid.
        iii. All four cells in the 2x2 block belong to the connected region `R`.
    b. If all conditions in step 4a are met, the cell `(r, c)` retains its value '7' in the output grid (it forms a "hole").
    c. Otherwise (if the cell is on the border, or the 2x2 block contains an '8', or any cell in the 2x2 block is outside region `R`), the cell's value is changed to '3' in the output grid.
5.  Cells not in region `R` (original '8's or '7's/ '3's not reachable from an initial '3') retain their original values.
6.  Initial '3' cells within region `R` also retain their value '3'.
