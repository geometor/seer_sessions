Identify the connected region `R` of all non-'8' cells reachable from any initial '3' cell by moving only through adjacent non-'8' cells (up, down, left, right).\n2.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` in the grid.\n4.  If the cell `(r, c)` belongs to the identified region `R` and its value in the input grid is '7':\n    a. Check if the 2x2 block ending at `(r, c)` (i.e., cells `(r-1, c-1)`, `(r-1, c)`, `(r, c-1)`, and `(r, c)`) satisfies the following conditions:\n        i.   The cell is not in the first row or first column (`r > 0` and `c > 0`).\n        ii.  All four cells in the 2x2 block had non-'8' values in the input grid.\n        iii. All four cells in the 2x2 block belong to the connected region `R`.\n    b. If all conditions in step 4a are met, the cell `(r, c)` retains its value '7' in the output grid (it forms a \"hole\").\n    c. Otherwise (if the cell is on the border, or the 2x2 block contains an '8', or any cell in the 2x2 block is outside region `R`), the cell's value is changed to '3' in the output grid.\n5.  Cells not in region `R` (original '8's or '7's/ '3's not reachable from an initial '3') retain their original values.\n6.  Initial '3' cells within region `R` also retain their value '3'.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_connected_region(grid: list[list[int]], sources: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> set[tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the connected region of non-8 cells reachable from source cells using BFS.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input grid.\n        sources: A list of (row, col) tuples representing the starting '3' cells.\n\n    Returns:\n        A set of (row, col) tuples representing the connected region R.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    region_r = set()\n    queue = deque()\n    visited = set()\n\n    # Initialize queue and visited set with sources that are not '8'\n    for r, c in sources:\n        if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols and grid[r][c] != 8:\n            if (r, c) not in visited:\n                visited.add((r, c))\n                queue.append((r, c))\n                region_r.add((r, c))\n\n    # BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Explore neighbors (up, down, left, right)\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n\n            # Check bounds\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                # Check if neighbor is not visited, not an '8'\n                if (nr, nc) not in visited and grid[nr][nc] != 8:\n                    visited.add((nr, nc))\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n                    region_r.add((nr, nc))\n\n    return region_r\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    Identifies a connected region R from '3' sources avoiding '8's.\n    Changes '7's in R to '3's, unless they form a specific 2x2 pattern\n    of non-'8' cells entirely within R.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    if rows == 0:\n        return []\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n    if cols == 0:\n        return [[] for _ in range(rows)]\n\n    # Initialize output_grid as a deep copy of input_grid\n    output_grid = copy.deepcopy(input_grid)\n\n    # Find initial '3' source cells\n    sources = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r][c] == 3:\n                sources.append((r, c))\n\n    # Find the connected region R\n    region_r = find_connected_region(input_grid, sources)\n\n    # Iterate through the grid and apply transformation rules\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Check if the cell is a '7' within the connected region R\n            if (r, c) in region_r and input_grid[r][c] == 7:\n                # Check the 2x2 block condition (Hypothesis 9) for keeping it '7'\n                is_hole = False\n                if r > 0 and c > 0:\n                    # Define the coordinates of the 2x2 block ending at (r, c)\n                    tl, tc, bl, br = (r - 1, c - 1), (r - 1, c), (r, c - 1), (r, c)\n\n                    # Check if all cells in the block are non-8 in the input\n                    # (input[br] is known to be 7, hence non-8)\n                    if (input_grid[tl[0]][tl[1]] != 8 and\n                            input_grid[tc[0]][tc[1]] != 8 and\n                            input_grid[bl[0]][bl[1]] != 8):\n\n                        # Check if all cells in the block are within region R\n                        # (br is known to be in region_r)\n                        if (tl in region_r and\n                                tc in region_r and\n                                bl in region_r):\n                            is_hole = True\n\n                # If it's not a hole, change it to '3'\n                if not is_hole:\n                    output_grid[r][c] = 3\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
