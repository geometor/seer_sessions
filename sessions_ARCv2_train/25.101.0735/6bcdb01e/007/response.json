Identify Boundaries and Sources: Locate all cells with value '8' (boundaries) and value '3' (sources) in the input grid.\n2.  Determine Reachable Region (R): Find the set `R` containing all grid cells `(r, c)` reachable from any source '3' cell via paths of adjacent non-'8' cells, using a Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n3.  Create Intermediate Grid (Initial Fill):\n    a.  Create a new grid, `intermediate_grid`, as a deep copy of the `input_grid`.\n    b.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` in the `intermediate_grid`.\n    c.  If the cell `(r, c)` is within region `R` *and* its value in the `input_grid` was '7', set `intermediate_grid[r][c] = 3`. (Otherwise, it retains its copied value).\n4.  Create Final Output Grid (Hole Preservation):\n    a.  Create the `output_grid` as a deep copy of the `intermediate_grid`.\n    b.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` in the grid.\n    c.  Check if this cell `(r, c)` was originally a '7' in the `input_grid` *and* belongs to region `R`.\n    d.  If both conditions in (c) are true, check the \"hole preservation\" rule:\n        i.  Verify that the cell is not in the first row or first column (`r > 0` and `c > 0`).\n        ii. Define the 2x2 block ending at `(r, c)` using coordinates: `tl=(r-1,c-1)`, `tc=(r-1,c)`, `bl=(r,c-1)`, `br=(r,c)`.\n        iii. Check if *all four* cells in this 2x2 block have the value '3' in the `intermediate_grid`.\n        iv. Check if *all four* corresponding cells in the `input_grid` had non-'8' values.\n        v. Check if *all four* corresponding cells belong to the region `R`.\n        vi. If *all* conditions (i) through (v) are met, then this cell forms a \"hole\": set `output_grid[r][c] = 7` (reverting it from the '3' in the intermediate grid).\n5.  Finalize: The `output_grid`, after checking all relevant cells for potential reversion in step 4, is the final result.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport copy\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_connected_region(grid: list[list[int]], sources: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> set[tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the connected region of non-8 cells reachable from source cells using BFS.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input grid.\n        sources: A list of (row, col) tuples representing the starting '3' cells.\n\n    Returns:\n        A set of (row, col) tuples representing the connected region R.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    region_r = set()\n    queue = deque()\n    visited = set()\n\n    # Initialize queue and visited set with sources that are not '8'\n    for r, c in sources:\n        if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols and grid[r][c] != 8:\n            if (r, c) not in visited:\n                visited.add((r, c))\n                queue.append((r, c))\n                # Add sources to region R immediately if they are valid\n                region_r.add((r, c))\n\n    # BFS to find all reachable non-8 cells\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        # Add current cell to region (if not already added as a source)\n        region_r.add((r,c))\n\n        # Explore neighbors (up, down, left, right)\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n\n            # Check bounds\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                # Check if neighbor is not visited and not an '8' wall\n                if (nr, nc) not in visited and grid[nr][nc] != 8:\n                    visited.add((nr, nc))\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n                    # Add valid neighbors to region R as they are found and added to queue\n                    region_r.add((nr, nc))\n\n    return region_r\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    if rows == 0:\n        return []\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n    if cols == 0:\n        return [[] for _ in range(rows)]\n\n    # 1.
