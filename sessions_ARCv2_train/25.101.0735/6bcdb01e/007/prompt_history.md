**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** Both input and output are grids (matrices) of single-digit integers.
2.  **Grid Size:** The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged from input to output (7x7 for `train_1`, 5x5 for `train_2`).
3.  **Values:** The grids contain primarily the digits 3, 7, and 8.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to involve changing some '7' cells to '3' cells. The '8' cells and the initial '3' cells seem to act as constraints or starting points.
5.  **Role of Numbers:**
    *   `8`: Acts as an impenetrable boundary or wall. These cells never change value.
    *   `3`: Acts as a starting "seed" or source for a change. Input '3's generally remain '3' or are part of a larger '3' region in the output.
    *   `7`: Represents a "fillable" or potentially changeable state. Some '7's are changed to '3's based on their relationship to the initial '3's and the '8' boundaries.
6.  **Pattern:** The change seems related to connectivity. A connected region is formed based on the initial '3's and the fillable '7's, bounded by the '8's. Cells within this region are potentially changed to '3'. However, not all '7's within this connected region change; some remain '7', forming "holes" or unchanged areas within the affected region.

**YAML Facts:**

    condition: The exact condition for changing a '7' to a '3' within the component is complex and seems to depend on the cell's position relative to boundaries and potentially other cells within the component, leaving some '7's unchanged ("holes").

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid. Create an output grid, initially identical to the input.
2.  Identify all cells in the input grid that contain the value '8'. These are immutable walls. The corresponding cells in the output grid will also be '8'.
3.  Identify all cells in the input grid that contain the value '3'. These are the "source" cells.
4.  Determine the connected region `R` consisting of all non-'8' cells that are reachable from at least one source '3' cell by moving only through adjacent non-'8' cells.
5.  Modify the output grid based on region `R`:
    a.  For any cell `(r, c)` that is *not* in region `R`, its value in the output grid remains the same as its input value (it will be either an '8' or a '7' that wasn't reachable from a '3').
    b.  For any cell `(r, c)` that *is* in region `R`:
        i.  If the input value `input[r][c]` was '3', the output value `output[r][c]` is '3'.
        ii. If the input value `input[r][c]` was '7', apply a specific rule to determine if the output should be '3' or remain '7'. This rule appears to change most '7's in `R` to '3', but preserves certain '7's as '7' (creating "holes"), potentially based on their local neighbourhood configuration or distance from the region's boundary (further investigation needed to specify the exact rule for these exceptions). A likely candidate rule is that a '7' remains '7' only if it is sufficiently "interior" within the region R, meaning it's not adjacent to any '8' wall or grid boundary, although the precise definition might be more complex. All other '7's in R become '3'.

**General Assessment:**

The provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying a connected region `R` reachable from initial '3' cells (avoiding '8' walls) and then changing most '7's within this region to '3's. It incorporates a specific rule to preserve some '7's as "holes", based on whether they form the bottom-right corner of a 2x2 block of non-'8' cells entirely contained within `R`.

The comparison between the transformed output and the expected output reveals significant discrepancies (17 errors in Example 1, 7 errors in Example 2). The code correctly identifies the intended 'holes' in some cases (`(2,4)`, `(4,4)` in Ex1; `(2,2)` in Ex2) but incorrectly preserves other '7's that should have become '3' (e.g., `(2,5)`, `(3,5)` in Ex1 based on trace). It also incorrectly changes some '7's near the region boundary or adjacent to '8's to '3' when they should have remained '7' (e.g., `(2,0)`, `(2,1)`, `(2,2)` in Ex1).

This indicates that the rule for identifying "holes" (cells that remain '7' within the connected region) is not accurately captured by the current 2x2 block condition. The rule is likely more complex or subtly different. The overall strategy of finding a connected region `R` and modifying '7's within it seems correct, but the precise condition for modification vs. preservation needs refinement.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Verify Region R:** Double-check the implementation and results of the connected region finding (`find_connected_region`) to ensure it accurately identifies all non-'8' cells reachable from the initial '3's. (Visual inspection suggests it's likely correct, but worth confirming).
2.  **Analyze Hole Characteristics:** Focus on the specific cells that remain '7' in the *expected* output (`(2,4)`, `(4,4)` in Ex1; `(2,2)` in Ex2) versus those '7's within R that *do* change to '3'. Compare their local neighborhoods (beyond just the 2x2 block ending there), their position relative to '8' boundaries, and their position within region R.
3.  **Refine Hole Rule:** Formulate a new hypothesis for the rule that distinguishes 'hole' cells from 'filled' cells within region R, consistent with both examples. This might involve different local patterns (e.g., 3x3), distance from boundaries, or connectivity properties *within* R.
4.  **Update NL Program and Code:** Modify the natural language program and the corresponding code logic to reflect the refined rule.

**Metrics:**

Let's quantify the differences for each example.

    condition: |
      The exact condition is complex and not fully determined by the current 2x2 rule.
      The current hypothesis (implemented in the tested code) is:
      A cell (r, c) that was originally '7' and is in R remains '7' IF
      r > 0 and c > 0, AND
      the 2x2 block ending at (r, c) had all non-8 input values, AND
      all 4 cells of this 2x2 block belong to region R.
      However, this rule leads to discrepancies with the expected output, indicating it's incomplete or incorrect.
  - action: preserve_value
    description: Cells retain their input value.
    target:
      - All cells with input value '8'.
      - All cells with input value '3' (within or outside R).
      - All cells with input value '7' that are *not* in region R.
      - Cells identified by the secondary_transformation (hole_preservation) rule.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Boundaries and Sources:** Locate all cells with value '8' (boundaries) and value '3' (sources) in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Reachable Region (R):** Find the set `R` containing all grid cells `(r, c)` that satisfy:
    *   The input value `input[r][c]` is not '8'.
    *   There exists a path from at least one source '3' cell to `(r, c)` consisting only of adjacent cells whose input values are not '8'.
3.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create an output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
4.  **Apply Primary Fill:** Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` in the grid. If `(r, c)` is within the region `R` *and* `input[r][c]` is '7', change the value in the `output_grid[r][c]` to '3'.
5.  **Apply Hole Preservation (Refined Rule Needed):** Identify a specific subset of cells modified in step 4 that should be reverted back to '7'. The precise rule for identifying these "holes" is the main challenge.
    *   **Current Flawed Hypothesis (from code):** A cell `(r, c)` processed in step 4 is reverted to '7' if `r > 0`, `c > 0`, the 2x2 block ending at `(r, c)` (`(r-1,c-1)` to `(r,c)`) contained only non-'8' values in the *input* grid, and all four cells of that block belong to region `R`.
    *   **Observation:** This 2x2 rule correctly identifies some required '7' holes but incorrectly preserves others that should be '3' according to the examples. Therefore, this rule needs significant refinement or replacement.
6.  **Finalize Output:** The output grid contains:
    *   Original '8' values.
    *   Original '3' values (sources).
    *   Original '7' values that were outside region `R`.
    *   Value '3' for cells that were originally '7', inside `R`, and *not* identified as holes by the (correct but currently unknown) preservation rule.
    *   Value '7' for cells identified as holes by the preservation rule (originally '7', inside `R`).

2.  **Determine Reachable Region (R):** Find the set `R` containing all grid cells `(r, c)` that satisfy:

    *   There exists a path from at least one source '3' cell to `(r, c)` consisting only of adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) whose input values are not '8'.
3.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create an output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
4.  **Apply Transformation:** Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` in the grid.
    a.  If the cell `(r, c)` is *not* part of the reachable region `R`, its value in the output grid remains the same as its input value.
    b.  If the cell `(r, c)` *is* part of the reachable region `R`:
        i.  If the input value `input_grid[r][c]` is '3', the output value `output_grid[r][c]` remains '3'.
        ii. If the input value `input_grid[r][c]` is '7', determine the output value based on adjacent cells:
            - Check all 4 adjacent neighbors `(nr, nc)` of `(r, c)`.
            - If *at least one* neighbor `(nr, nc)` exists such that:
                1) It is within the grid boundaries.
                2) Its input value `input_grid[nr][nc]` is '7'.
                3) It is also part of the reachable region `R`.
            - Then, the cell `(r, c)` retains its value '7' in the output grid (it forms part of a "hole" or preserved '7' cluster).
            - Otherwise (if no such adjacent neighbor exists), the cell's value is changed to '3' in the output grid.
5.  **Finalize Output:** The resulting grid after applying these rules is the final output.

**General Assessment:**

The second attempt (code_01) used a rule based on adjacent '7's within the reachable region `R` to determine which '7's should be preserved. The results show this was also incorrect, preserving far too many '7's compared to the expected output (14 errors in Ex1, 8 in Ex2). The core issue remains the accurate identification of the "hole" preservation rule.

The analysis suggests that both previous attempts (2x2 block check on input, adjacent '7' check) failed to capture the specific conditions under which a '7' within the reachable region `R` remains a '7'.

A new hypothesis is proposed:
1. Identify the reachable region `R` from '3's, avoiding '8's.
2. Initialize the output grid from the input.
3. Iterate through the grid. For each cell `(r, c)` that is originally '7' and within `R`:
    a. Tentatively change its value to '3' in the output grid.
    b. Check if this change *completes* a 2x2 block of '3's ending at `(r, c)` (i.e., `output[r-1:r+1, c-1:c+1]` are all '3's), **AND** if the corresponding 2x2 block in the *input* grid contained only non-'8' values, **AND** if all four cells of the block belong to region `R`.
    c. If all these conditions (2x2 of '3's created in output, valid input block, all in R) are met, revert the change, setting `output[r][c]` back to '7'.

This revised hypothesis focuses on preventing the formation of specific 2x2 blocks of '3's during the transformation process.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Boundaries and Sources:** Locate all cells with value '8' (boundaries) and value '3' (sources) in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Reachable Region (R):** Find the set `R` containing all grid cells `(r, c)` that satisfy:
    *   The input value `input_grid[r][c]` is not '8'.
    *   There exists a path from at least one source '3' cell to `(r, c)` consisting only of adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) whose input values are not '8'. Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all source '3' cells.
3.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create an output grid, making a deep copy of the input grid.
4.  **Apply Transformation with Hole Prevention:** Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the grid (e.g., row by row, column by column).
    a.  Check if the current cell `(r, c)` is within the determined region `R` *and* its value in the input grid `input_grid[r][c]` is '7'.
    b.  If both conditions in (a) are true:
        i.  Tentatively set the corresponding cell in the output grid to '3': `output_grid[r][c] = 3`.
        ii. Check if this change *completed* a "forbidden" 2x2 block ending at `(r, c)`. A block is forbidden if:
            *   The cell is not in the first row or first column (`r > 0` and `c > 0`).
            *   All four cells forming the 2x2 block ending at `(r, c)` in the **output grid** now have the value '3' (i.e., `output_grid[r-1][c-1]`, `output_grid[r-1][c]`, `output_grid[r][c-1]`, and `output_grid[r][c]` are all '3').
            *   All four corresponding cells in the **input grid** had non-'8' values.
            *   All four corresponding cells belong to the region `R`.
        iii. If all conditions for a forbidden 2x2 block are met, revert the change: set `output_grid[r][c]` back to '7'.
5.  **Finalize Output:** The output grid, after iterating through all cells and applying the tentative fill and potential reversion, is the final result. Cells not modified in step 4 retain their initial values from the input grid (handled by the initial deep copy).

**General Assessment:**

The latest code (`code_02`) implemented a rule attempting to preserve '7's by preventing the formation of 2x2 blocks of '3's under specific conditions (input block was non-'8' and within the reachable region `R`). This significantly improved the result for Example 2 (down to 4 errors) but still produced 15 errors for Example 1.

Analysis of the errors reveals two primary issues:
1.  **Boundary Handling:** The `if r > 0 and c > 0` check inherently prevents the 2x2 rule from applying to cells in the first row or column. The expected output shows some '7's should be preserved even near boundaries (e.g., `(1,0)`, `(2,0)`, `(4,0)`, `(6,0)` in Ex1; `(2,0)`, `(4,0)`, `(0,2)`, `(2,4)` in Ex2). The current rule incorrectly converts these to '3'.
2.  **Incorrect Reversions:** The rule seems to be reverting some cells back to '7' when they should remain '3' (e.g., `(3,1)`, `(3,2)`, `(3,3)`, `(3,4)`, `(3,5)`, `(5,2)`, `(4,3)` in Ex1). This suggests the condition for reverting (forming a 2x2 block of 3s in the output) might be too broad or interacting unexpectedly due to the single-pass processing order.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

Adopt a two-pass approach to decouple the initial fill from the hole preservation:
1.  **Pass 1 (Initial Fill):** Determine region `R`. Create an intermediate grid where all '7's within `R` are changed to '3'. All other cells (original '3's, '8's, '7's outside R) retain their input values.
2.  **Pass 2 (Hole Identification):** Create the final output grid, initially copying the intermediate grid. Iterate through the *intermediate* grid. For each cell `(r, c)` that corresponds to an *original* '7' within region `R`, check if it forms the bottom-right corner of a 2x2 block that meets the criteria *based on the intermediate grid and input conditions*. If the conditions are met, revert the value in the *final output grid* at `(r, c)` to '7'.

This ensures the 2x2 check operates on a consistent state (the fully filled intermediate grid) and avoids order-dependent issues. The boundary condition `r > 0 and c > 0` needs to be applied correctly within this check.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Boundaries and Sources:** Locate all cells with value '8' (boundaries) and value '3' (sources) in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Reachable Region (R):** Find the set `R` containing all grid cells `(r, c)` reachable from any source '3' cell via paths of adjacent non-'8' cells, using a Breadth-First Search (BFS).
3.  **Create Intermediate Grid (Initial Fill):**
    a.  Create a new grid, `intermediate_grid`, as a deep copy of the `input_grid`.
    b.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` in the `intermediate_grid`.
    c.  If the cell `(r, c)` is within region `R` *and* its value in the `input_grid` was '7', set `intermediate_grid[r][c] = 3`. (Otherwise, it retains its copied value).
4.  **Create Final Output Grid (Hole Preservation):**
    a.  Create the `output_grid` as a deep copy of the `intermediate_grid`.
    b.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` in the grid.
    c.  Check if this cell `(r, c)` was originally a '7' in the `input_grid` *and* belongs to region `R`.
    d.  If both conditions in (c) are true, check the "hole preservation" rule:
        i.  Verify that the cell is not in the first row or first column (`r > 0` and `c > 0`).
        ii. Define the 2x2 block ending at `(r, c)` using coordinates: `tl=(r-1,c-1)`, `tc=(r-1,c)`, `bl=(r,c-1)`, `br=(r,c)`.
        iii. Check if *all four* cells in this 2x2 block have the value '3' in the `intermediate_grid`.
        iv. Check if *all four* corresponding cells in the `input_grid` had non-'8' values.
        v. Check if *all four* corresponding cells belong to the region `R`.
        vi. If *all* conditions (i) through (v) are met, then this cell forms a "hole": set `output_grid[r][c] = 7` (reverting it from the '3' in the intermediate grid).
5.  **Finalize:** The `output_grid`, after checking all relevant cells for potential reversion in step 4, is the final result.
