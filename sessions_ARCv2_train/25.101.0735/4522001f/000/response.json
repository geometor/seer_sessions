This suggests an upscaling or pattern generation process based on the input.\n2.  **Input Symbols:**\n    *   `0`: Appears to represent a background or empty state.\n    *   `2`: Seems to act as a central reference point or marker within the input grid. Its position is key.\n    *   `3`: Appears to represent contextual elements or triggers located relative to the '2'. Their positions relative to '2' dictate the output pattern.\n3.  **Output Pattern:** The output consists of blocks (specifically 4x4 blocks) filled with the value '3', placed on a background of '0's. The number and placement of these blocks depend on the input configuration.\n4.  **Transformation Logic:** The core logic involves identifying the '2', then for each '3' in the input, determining its position relative to the '2'. This relative position maps to a specific location in the larger 9x9 output grid where a 4x4 block of '3's is drawn.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

Find the row and column coordinates, `(r2, c2)`, of the cell containing the value 2 in the 3x3 input grid.\n3.  Examine each cell `(r, c)` in the 3x3 input grid.\n4.

Using the determined `(start_row, start_col)`, fill a 4x4 area in the target grid with the value 3.

After checking all cells in the input grid, the target 9x9 grid represents the final output."
