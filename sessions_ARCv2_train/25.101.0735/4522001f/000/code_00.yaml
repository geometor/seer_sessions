task_description: Generate a 9x9 output grid based on patterns indicated in a 3x3 input grid.

elements:
  - object: InputGrid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - cells: contain values 0, 2, or 3
  - object: OutputGrid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x9
      - cells: contain values 0 or 3
  - object: MarkerCell
    properties:
      - represents: reference point in InputGrid
      - value: 2
      - coordinates: (r2, c2)
  - object: ContextCell
    properties:
      - represents: trigger elements in InputGrid
      - value: 3
      - coordinates: (r, c)
      - relative_coordinates: (dr, dc) = (r - r2, c - c2) ; calculated relative to MarkerCell
  - object: BackgroundCell
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - represents: empty space in InputGrid and OutputGrid
  - object: PatternBlock
    properties:
      - value: 3
      - dimensions: 4x4
      - location: placed in OutputGrid based on ContextCell's relative_coordinates

actions:
  - name: InitializeOutput
    actor: System
    input: None
    output: 9x9 OutputGrid filled with 0s
  - name: LocateMarker
    actor: System
    input: InputGrid
    output: coordinates (r2, c2) of the cell with value 2
  - name: IdentifyContext
    actor: System
    input: InputGrid
    output: list of coordinates (r, c) for cells with value 3
  - name: CalculateRelativePosition
    actor: System
    input: ContextCell coordinates (r, c), MarkerCell coordinates (r2, c2)
    output: relative coordinates (dr, dc)
  - name: MapPositionToOutputBlock
    actor: System
    input: relative coordinates (dr, dc)
    output: top-left starting coordinates (start_row, start_col) for a PatternBlock in OutputGrid
    details: |
      Specific mapping rules:
      (-1, -1) or (-1, 0) -> (0, 0)
      (0, 1) or (1, 0) -> (1, 1)
      (0, -1) -> (4, 4)
      (1, 1) -> (5, 5)
  - name: DrawPatternBlock
    actor: System
    input: OutputGrid, starting coordinates (start_row, start_col)
    output: Modified OutputGrid with a 4x4 block of 3s placed

relationships:
  - type: determines
    subject: InputGrid configuration (positions of 2 and 3s)
    object: OutputGrid pattern (placement of 4x4 blocks of 3s)
  - type: relative_to
    subject: ContextCell position
    object: MarkerCell position
  - type: maps_to
    subject: Relative position of ContextCell
    object: Starting position of PatternBlock in OutputGrid
