## Perception of Elements

The task involves transforming a grid of digits.
- **Input:** A rectangular grid (matrix) composed of single digits.
- **Output:** A grid of the same dimensions as the input.
- **Transformation:** The transformation appears to operate row by row. Some rows remain unchanged, while others are modified. The modification seems specific to rows at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...).

objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - type: matrix
      - content: single digits
      - rows: list of rows
      - columns: list of columns
      - dimensions: rows x columns (M x N)
  - name: row
    properties:
      - type: list of digits
      - index: integer (0-based)
      - length: N (number of columns in the grid)
  - name: cell
    properties:
      - type: single digit
      - position: (row_index, column_index)
      - value: integer (0-9)

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of its index (starting from 0).
4.  For each row:
    a.  Check if the row index is even (0, 2, 4, ...).
    b.  If the index is even, copy the row directly from the input grid to the corresponding row in the output grid.
    c.  If the index is odd (1, 3, 5, ...):
        i.  Perform a right cyclic shift on the elements of the row by one position. (The last element moves to the first position, and all other elements shift one position to the right).
        ii. Place the resulting shifted row into the corresponding row of the output grid.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
