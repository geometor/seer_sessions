            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code, based on observations from the first example, successfully captured some aspects of the transformation (invariance of the central cross and non-7 cells, basic symmetric replacement). However, it failed on examples 1 and 3, indicating that both the primary rule (when the symmetric cell is not 7) and the fallback rule (when the symmetric cell is 7) were either incomplete or incorrect.\n\nThe primary failure points are:\n1.  **Base Rule Exception:** The rule `output[r,c] = input[sr,sc]` when `input[sr,sc] != 7` is incorrect for the target cell `(3,3)` in Example 1. The output should be 0, but the symmetric value is 8. The correct source appears to be `input[1,0]`.\n2.  **Fallback Rule Complexity:** The simple fallback rule (`r<2 -> input[4,0]`, `r>2 -> input[0,4]`) derived from Example 2 is insufficient. Examples 1 and 3 require different source cells depending on the specific target cell coordinates when the symmetric cell is also 7. The source selection appears to involve specific corner cells (`input[0,4]`, `input[4,0]`, `input[4,4]`) and potentially an inner cell (`input[3,3]`), with a complex decision logic based on the target cell's location and possibly the values at these potential source cells.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Gather Metrics:** Quantify the errors of the original code using `code_execution` to confirm the number and location of incorrect pixels.\n2.  **Refine Rules:** Develop a more detailed rule set based on analyzing all three examples simultaneously.\n    *   Modify the base rule to handle the `(3,3)` exception.\n    *   Develop a comprehensive fallback rule that maps each specific target cell outside the cross (`(0,0), (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,4)`) to its correct source cell or a sequence of source cells to check when `input[sr,sc] == 7`.\n3.  **Update YAML and NL Program:** Document the revised understanding accurately. Hypothesis 9 from the thought process seems the most promising, although it still had minor discrepancies. We will formulate the NL program based on the most robust hypothesis derived (Hypothesis 9, despite known minor flaws, as it correctly explains the most cases across all examples).\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nUsing the provided results from the previous execution to quantify the errors:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Failed. 3 pixels off.\n    *   `O[1,3]`: Expected 5, Got 0. (Fallback Error)\n    *   `O[3,1]`: Expected 5, Got 0. (Fallback Error)\n    *   `O[3,3]`: Expected 0, Got 8. (Base Rule Error)\n*   **Example 2:** Succeeded. 0 pixels off.\n*   **Example 3:** Failed. 4 pixels off.\n    *   `O[0,0]`: Expected 5, Got 3. (Fallback Error)\n    *   `O[1,3]`: Expected 4, Got 3. (Fallback Error)\n    *   `O[3,1]`: Expected 4, Got 5. (Fallback Error)\n    *   `O[4,4]`: Expected 4, Got 5. (Fallback Error)\n\nThis confirms the previous code failed significantly on the fallback rule (`sym_val == 7`) and had one identified exception to the base rule (`sym_val != 7`).\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
