*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are 5x5 grids of single-digit integers.
    *   The transformation primarily affects cells containing the digit '7'.
    *   A central cross shape (row 2 and column 2, 0-indexed) seems significant. Cells within this cross, if they are '7', remain unchanged. All non-'7' cells also remain unchanged.
    *   The core transformation applies only to cells containing '7' that are *outside* the central cross.
    *   The transformation rule for these specific '7's appears related to rotational symmetry around the center of the grid (cell 2,2).
    *   The value of the symmetrically opposite cell `(4-r, 4-c)` plays a key role.
    *   There seems to be a base rule involving the symmetrical cell's value and a fallback rule when the symmetrical cell also contains '7'.
    *   The corner values of the input grid, specifically the bottom-left `I[4,0]` and top-right 
`I[0,4]`, seem involved in the fallback rule.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    grid_dimensions: [5, 5]
    center_cell_coords: [2, 2] # 0-indexed
    marker_digit: 7
    invariant_cells:
      - type: central_cross # row 2 or column 2
      - type: non_marker_digit # cells not equal to 7
    target_cells:
      - type: marker_digit_outside_cross # cells equal to 7 AND r != 2 AND c != 2
    transformation_rule:
      depends_on:
        - target_cell_value: # Always 7
        - symmetrical_cell_value: input[4-r][4-c]
        - corner_values: [input[0,4], input[4,0]] # Top-right and Bottom-left

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid (rows `r` from 0 to 4, columns `c` from 0 to 4).
    3.  Check if the current cell `(r, c)` contains the marker digit '7' AND is outside the central cross (i.e., `r` is not 2 AND `c` is not 2).
    4.  If the condition in step 3 is true:
        a.  Find the coordinates of the symmetrically opposite cell: `sr = 4 - r`, `sc = 4 - c`.
        b.  Get the value of the symmetrical cell from the *input* grid: `sym_val = input[sr][sc]`.
        c.  **Rule Application:**
            i.  If `sym_val` is NOT 7, update the output grid at `(r, c)` with `sym_val`: `output[r][c] = sym_val`.
            ii. If `sym_val` IS 7 (meaning both the cell and its symmetrical partner are '7's outside the cross), apply a fallback rule based on the cell's row position and specific corner values from the *input* grid:
                *   If the cell's row `r` is less than 2 (top half), update the output grid at `(r, c)` with the value from the bottom-left corner of the input grid: `output[r][c] = input[4][0]`.
                *   If the cell's row `r` is greater than 2 (bottom half), update the output grid at `(r, c)` with the value from the top-right corner of the input grid: `output[r][c] = input[0][4]`.
    5.  If the condition in step 3 is false (the cell is not '7' or is part of the central cross), the output cell value remains the same as the input cell value (already handled by initializing output as a copy of input).
    6.  Return the final output grid.
