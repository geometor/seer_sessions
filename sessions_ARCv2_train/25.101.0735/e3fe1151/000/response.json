Cells within this cross, if they are '7', remain unchanged. All non-'7' cells also remain unchanged.\n    *   The core transformation applies only to cells containing '7' that are *outside* the central cross.\n    *   The transformation rule for these specific '7's appears related to rotational symmetry around the center of the grid (cell 2,2).\n    *   The value of the symmetrically opposite cell `(4-r, 4-c)` plays a key role.\n    *   There seems to be a base rule involving the symmetrical cell's value and a fallback rule when the symmetrical cell also contains '7'.\n    *   The corner values of the input grid, specifically the bottom-left `I[4,0]` and top-right "

Check if the current cell `(r, c)` contains the marker digit '7' AND is outside the central cross (i.e., `r` is not 2 AND `c` is not 2).\n    4.  If the condition in step 3 is true:\n        a.  Find the coordinates of the symmetrically opposite cell: `sr = 4 - r`, `sc = 4 - c`.\n        b.

If `sym_val` IS 7 (meaning both the cell and its symmetrical partner are '7's outside the cross), apply a fallback rule based on the cell's row position and specific corner values from the *input* grid:\n                *   If the cell's row `r` is less than 2 (top half), update the output grid at `(r, c)` with the value from the bottom-left corner of the input grid: `output[r][c] = input[4][0]`.\n                *   If the cell's row `r` is greater than 2 (bottom half), update the output grid at `(r, c)` with the value from the top-right corner of the input grid: `output[r][c] = input[0][4]`.\n    5.
