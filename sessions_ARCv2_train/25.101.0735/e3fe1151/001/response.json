Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the input grid.\n3. Identify 'target' cells: cells containing the digit '7' that are outside the central cross (i.e., r != 2 and c != 2).\n4. For each target cell:\n    a. Find the symmetrically opposite cell coordinates (sr = 4 - r, sc = 4 - c).\n    b. Get the value of the symmetrical cell from the *input* grid (sym_val = input[sr][sc]).\n    c. If sym_val is NOT 7, update the output grid at (r, c) with sym_val.\n    d. If sym_val IS 7 (fallback rule):\n        i. If the target cell's row r is less than 2 (top half), update the output grid at (r, c) with the value from the input grid's bottom-left corner (input[4][0]).\n        ii. If the target cell's row r is greater than 2 (bottom half), update the output grid at (r, c) with the value from the input grid's top-right corner (input[0][4]).\n5. Cells that are not target cells (i.e., not '7' or are on the central cross) remain unchanged.\n6.
