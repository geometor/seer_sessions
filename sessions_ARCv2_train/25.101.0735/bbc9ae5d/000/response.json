These sequences typically start with one or more identical non-zero digits, followed by zero or more zeros.\n\nThe output consists of multiple lines. Each line is also a sequence of space-separated integers.\nThe first line of the output is always identical to the input line.\nSubsequent lines are generated iteratively. In each step, the leftmost remaining '0' in the sequence is replaced by the *first* digit found in the original input sequence.\nThe number of lines generated in the output seems to depend on the total number of integers in the input sequence (`L`). Specifically, the number of output lines appears to be the ceiling of `L / 2`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
