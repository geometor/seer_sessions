"""
Transforms an input 2D grid into an output 2D grid with different dimensions.

The transformation involves:
1. Calculating the dimensions of the output grid based on the input grid's columns.
   - Output rows: O_rows = floor(input_cols / 2) + 1
   - Output cols: O_cols = input_cols + O_rows - 1
2. Dividing the output grid horizontally into two parts: O1 (left) and O2 (right).
   - O2 width: O2_cols = O_rows
   - O1 width: O1_cols = input_cols - 1
3. Constructing the right part (O2):
   - Select the first O_rows elements from the first row of the input grid.
   - Tile this slice vertically O_rows times to form O2.
4. Constructing the left part (O1):
   - Extract a subgrid 'S' from the input grid: Rows from (input_rows - O_rows) to input_rows, Columns from 1 to input_cols. S has dimensions O_rows x O1_cols.
   - Transform S into O1. The exact transformation requires further refinement, as simple rotations/flips did not match the examples consistently. As a placeholder, this implementation uses a specific rotation based on partial analysis (rot90 ccw of a *different* subgrid that worked for train_2, adapted here). This is likely incorrect and needs revision.
   * Correction based on thought process: The rot90(ccw) hypothesis applied to S=I[bottom_rows, left_cols] seemed most promising for train_2, despite dimension issues. Let's code that specific hypothesis for S1 = I[(I_rows - O_rows):I_rows, 0:O1_cols].
   * Further Correction: Since rot90 changes dimensions MxN -> NxM, and O1 must be O_rows x O1_cols, this approach fails for non-square cases. Sticking to the NLP derived S = I[(I_rows - O_rows):I_rows, 1:I_cols] and returning it untransformed as a placeholder until a better transformation is found.
5. Concatenating O1 and O2 horizontally to form the final output grid.
