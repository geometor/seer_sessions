If all elements on the main diagonal are identical (monochromatic):\n   a. The output is a 1x1 grid containing that identical element value.\n3. If the elements on the main diagonal are not all identical:\n   a. Identify all unique 2x2 subgrids present in the input grid.\n   b. For each unique 2x2 subgrid, count its total number of occurrences (frequency).\n   c. For each unique 2x2 subgrid, find the coordinates (row, column) of the top-left corner of its first occurrence (scanning row by row, then column by column).\n   d. Determine the maximum frequency achieved by any 2x2 subgrid.\n   e. Select the 2x2 subgrid that has this maximum frequency.\n   f. If multiple subgrids share the maximum frequency, select the one whose first occurrence has the smallest row index.\n   g. If there is still a tie (same maximum frequency and same minimum row index), select the one among them with the smallest column index.\n   h. The selected 2x2 subgrid is the output.\n\n(Note: This implements Hypothesis A from the analysis, which fits train_1 and train_2 but may not fully explain train_3).\n\"\"\"\n\ndef get_main_diagonal(grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"Extracts the main diagonal elements from a grid.\"\"\"\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    size = min(rows, cols)\n    return [grid[i][i] for i in range(size)]\n\ndef is_monochromatic(sequence: list[int]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Checks if all elements in a sequence are the same.\"\"\"\n    if not sequence:\n        return True # An empty sequence can be considered monochromatic\n    first_element = sequence[0]\n    return all(element == first_element for element in sequence)\n\ndef get_subgrid(grid: list[list[int]], r: int, c: int, height: int, width: int) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"Extracts a subgrid of specified size starting at (r, c).\"\"\"\n    return [row[c:c+width] for row in grid[r:r+height]]\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    Checks for monochromatic diagonal first.
