Task: Pattern identification and extraction from a grid.

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Rectangular shape (Height H, Width W)
    - Elements are single digits (0-9)
    - Size varies (e.g., 4x4, 5x5, 7x7)

Output:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Rectangular shape, smaller than or equal to input.
    - Elements are single digits.
    - Size determined by rule: 1x1 or 2x2 based on input's main diagonal.

Relationships_and_Actions:
  - Rule_Case_1: # Applies to train_1 (Passed)
      Condition: Input grid's main diagonal is monochromatic (all elements are the same).
      Action: Output a 1x1 grid containing the single element value from the main diagonal.
  - Rule_Case_2: # Applies to train_2 (Failed), train_3 (Failed)
      Condition: Input grid's main diagonal is NOT monochromatic.
      Action_Output_Size: The output grid will be 2x2.
      Action_Selection_Sub_Problem: Identify the specific 2x2 subgrid to output.
      # --- Current Implemented Hypothesis (Failed on Ex2, Ex3) ---
      Hypothesis_Action:
        - Find all unique 2x2 subgrids within the input.
        - Calculate the frequency of occurrence for each unique 2x2 subgrid.
        - Determine the first occurrence position (top-left corner: row, then column index) for each unique 2x2 subgrid.
        - Select the 2x2 subgrid with the highest frequency.
        - If multiple subgrids share the highest frequency, select the one whose first occurrence has the smallest row index.
        - If there is still a tie, select the one among them with the smallest column index.
      Hypothesis_Failure_Ex2: Tied on max frequency (3). Expected output ((1, 1), (2, 1)) at (1,0). Hypothesis selected ((2, 1), (1, 1)) at (0,0) due to earlier row index.
      Hypothesis_Failure_Ex3: Expected output ((5, 5), (5, 2)) has frequency 3, first pos (2,2). Hypothesis selected ((2, 2), (2, 2)) which has frequency 4 (the max) and first pos (0,0). Maximum frequency is not the correct primary criterion.
      # --- End Current Hypothesis ---
      Uncertainty: The correct criteria for selecting the 2x2 subgrid in this case remain unknown. It does not appear to be solely based on maximizing frequency or minimizing first position. Other factors (e.g., element sum, relationship to grid features, different tie-breaking) might be involved, but no tested alternative consistently explains all examples.

Derived_Objects:
  - Main_Diagonal: Sequence of elements from top-left to bottom-right.
  - Subgrid_2x2: A 2x2 section of the main grid, identified by its content and potentially its occurrences.
  - Frequency: Count of occurrences of a specific 2x2 subgrid pattern.
  - Position: Top-left coordinates (row, col) of a subgrid occurrence.
  - First_Position: The position (row, col) of the first time a specific 2x2 pattern appears when scanning the input grid row by row, then column by column.
  - Sum: Sum of the 4 elements within a 2x2 subgrid (considered as potential factor).
