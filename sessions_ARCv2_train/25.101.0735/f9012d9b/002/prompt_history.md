**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Data:** The input is a rectangular grid (matrix) of single digits (0-9). The grid sizes vary across examples (4x4, 5x5, 7x7).
2.  **Output Data:** The output is also a rectangular grid of single digits. The output size is smaller than the input size and varies (1x1, 2x2, 2x2).
3.  **Core Task:** The goal appears to be identifying a representative pattern or characteristic from the input grid and outputting it.
4.  **Observed Patterns/Logic:**
    *   **Example 1:** The input is 4x4, the output is 1x1 ('8'). The main diagonal of the input is `[8, 8, 8, 8]`. This suggests a rule related to monochromatic diagonals might apply.
    *   **Example 2:** The input is 5x5, the output is 2x2 (`[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`). The main diagonal is not monochromatic. The output pattern `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` appears 3 times in the input, starting earliest at position (1,0). Another pattern `[[1, 1], [1, 2]]` also appears 3 times, starting earliest at (1,1). The output seems to be the most frequent 2x2 pattern, with ties broken by the earliest starting position (row first, then column).
    *   **Example 3:** The input is 7x7, the output is 2x2 (`[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`). The main diagonal is not monochromatic. The pattern `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` appears 3 times, starting earliest at (2,2). However, other 2x2 patterns (e.g., `[[2, 2], [2, 2]]`) appear more frequently (7 times) and start earlier (at (0,0)). This example contradicts the simple "most frequent, earliest position" rule observed in Example 2. There seems to be a more complex selection criterion when the diagonal isn't monochromatic, which doesn't solely prioritize frequency or first position. The selection of `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` might involve other factors like the sum of elements, the number of unique elements within the pattern, or context within the grid (like adjacency to monochromatic lines), although simple versions of these tie-breakers didn't consistently explain Example 3.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
Task: Pattern identification from a grid

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Rectangular shape (Height H, Width W)
    - Elements are single digits (0-9)
    - Size varies (e.g., 4x4, 5x5, 7x7)

Output:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Rectangular shape (typically smaller than input)
    - Elements are single digits
    - Size varies (e.g., 1x1, 2x2)

Relationships_and_Actions:
  - Rule_Case_1: # Applies to train_1
      Condition: Input grid's main diagonal is monochromatic (all elements are the same).
      Action: Output a 1x1 grid containing the single element value from the main diagonal.
  - Rule_Case_2: # Applies to train_2 and train_3, but logic is complex/uncertain for train_3
      Condition: Input grid's main diagonal is NOT monochromatic.
      Intermediate_Step: Identify all possible 2x2 subgrids within the input grid.
      Intermediate_Step_Property: Calculate the frequency of occurrence for each unique 2x2 subgrid.
      Intermediate_Step_Property: Determine the first occurrence position (top-left corner, row then column index) for each unique 2x2 subgrid.
      Action: Select the 2x2 subgrid based on prioritization criteria (Uncertainty exists here based on train_3):
        - Hypothesis_A (fits train_2, fails train_3): Prioritize highest frequency, then earliest position.
        # - Hypothesis_B (fits train_2, fails train_3): Prioritize highest frequency, then highest sum, then earliest position.
        # - Other complex criteria might be involved, potentially relating to element composition or grid context.
      Output: The selected 2x2 subgrid.

Derived_Objects:
  - Main_Diagonal: Sequence of elements from top-left to bottom-right.
  - Subgrid_2x2: A 2x2 section of the main grid.
  - Frequency: Count of occurrences of a specific subgrid.
  - Position: Top-left coordinates (row, col) of a subgrid occurrence.
  # - Sum: Sum of the elements within a subgrid. # (Considered as potential tie-breaker)
  # - Unique_Elements: Count of distinct digits within a subgrid. # (Considered as potential tie-breaker)

Uncertainties:
  - The exact selection criteria for the 2x2 subgrid when the main diagonal is not monochromatic are not fully resolved by the examples, particularly due to train_3 where a less frequent pattern is chosen over more frequent ones. The simple prioritization rules tested do not cover all cases.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the main diagonal of the input grid (elements from top-left to bottom-right).
2.  If all elements on the main diagonal are identical:
    a.  The output is a 1x1 grid containing that identical element value.
3.  If the elements on the main diagonal are not all identical:
    a.  Identify all unique 2x2 subgrids present in the input grid.
    b.  For each unique 2x2 subgrid, count its total number of occurrences (frequency) within the input grid.
    c.  For each unique 2x2 subgrid, find the coordinates (row, column) of the top-left corner of its first occurrence (scanning the input grid row by row, then column by column).
    d.  Determine the maximum frequency (`Fmax`) achieved by any 2x2 subgrid.
    e.  Select all 2x2 subgrids that have this maximum frequency `Fmax`.
    f.  If only one subgrid has frequency `Fmax`, this subgrid is the output.
    g.  If multiple subgrids share the maximum frequency `Fmax`, compare their first occurrence positions. Select the subgrid whose first occurrence has the smallest row index. If there's still a tie, select the one among them with the smallest column index.
    h.  The selected 2x2 subgrid is the output.

Transformation Rule:

1. Examine the main diagonal of the input grid (elements from top-left to bottom-right).
2. If all elements on the main diagonal are identical (monochromatic):
   a. The output is a 1x1 grid containing that identical element value.
3. If the elements on the main diagonal are not all identical:
   a. Identify all unique 2x2 subgrids present in the input grid.
   b. For each unique 2x2 subgrid, count its total number of occurrences (frequency).
   c. For each unique 2x2 subgrid, find the coordinates (row, column) of the top-left corner of its first occurrence (scanning row by row, then column by column).
   d. Determine the maximum frequency achieved by any 2x2 subgrid.
   e. Select the 2x2 subgrid that has this maximum frequency.
   f. If multiple subgrids share the maximum frequency, select the one whose first occurrence has the smallest row index.
   g. If there is still a tie (same maximum frequency and same minimum row index), select the one among them with the smallest column index.
   h. The selected 2x2 subgrid is the output.

(Note: This implements Hypothesis A from the analysis, which fits train_1 and train_2 but may not fully explain train_3).
