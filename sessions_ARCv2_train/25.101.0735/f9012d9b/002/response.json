            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code successfully implemented the hypothesis derived from Example 1 (monochromatic diagonal). However, testing against Examples 2 and 3 revealed that this hypothesis, particularly the rule for non-monochromatic diagonals (select the most frequent 2x2 subgrid, breaking ties with the earliest position), is incorrect or incomplete.\n\n*   **Example 1:** Passed. The monochromatic diagonal rule seems correct.\n*   **Example 2:** Failed. The code identified the correct set of most frequent 2x2 subgrids (frequency 3), but the tie-breaking rule (earliest position: row 0, col 0) selected `[[2, 1], [1, 1]]` instead of the expected `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` (first position: row 1, col 0). This indicates the tie-breaking mechanism is different from the initial assumption.\n*   **Example 3:** Failed Significantly. The code selected the most frequent 2x2 subgrid (`[[2, 2], [2, 2]]`, frequency 7, position 0,0). The expected output (`[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`) has a much lower frequency (3) and starts later (position 2,2). This strongly suggests that maximum frequency is *not* the primary selection criterion when the diagonal is not monochromatic.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Retain Rule 1:** Keep the rule for monochromatic diagonals as it passed Example 1.\n2.  **Re-evaluate Rule 2:** The rule for non-monochromatic diagonals needs significant revision. The simple \"most frequent, earliest position\" logic is insufficient. Various alternatives were considered (highest sum, grid mode/max value inclusion, different position tie-breakers, etc.), but none consistently explained both Example 2 and Example 3.\n3.  **Focus on Reporting:** Since a definitive rule for Case 2 cannot be confidently determined from the provided examples, the best approach is to:\n    *   Accurately document the observed frequencies and positions for relevant patterns using code execution.\n    *   Clearly state the failure points of the previous hypothesis.\n    *   Update the Natural Language Program and YAML to reflect the current best guess (the one implemented), while explicitly highlighting its known failures and the unresolved ambiguity in the selection criteria for non-monochromatic cases. This provides clear context for the next phase.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
