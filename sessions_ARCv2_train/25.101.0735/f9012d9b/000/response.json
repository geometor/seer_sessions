The grid sizes vary across examples (4x4, 5x5, 7x7).\n2.  **Output Data:** The output is also a rectangular grid of single digits. The output size is smaller than the input size and varies (1x1, 2x2, 2x2).\n3.  **Core Task:** The goal appears to be identifying a representative pattern or characteristic from the input grid and outputting it.\n4.  **Observed Patterns/Logic:**\n    *   **Example 1:** The input is 4x4, the output is 1x1 ('8'). The main diagonal of the input is `[8, 8, 8, 8]`. This suggests a rule related to monochromatic diagonals might apply.\n    *   **Example 2:** The input is 5x5, the output is 2x2 (`[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`). The main diagonal is not monochromatic. The output pattern `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` appears 3 times in the input, starting earliest at position (1,0). Another pattern `[[1, 1], [1, 2]]` also appears 3 times, starting earliest at (1,1). The output seems to be the most frequent 2x2 pattern, with ties broken by the earliest starting position (row first, then column).\n    *   **Example 3:** The input is 7x7, the output is 2x2 (`[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`). The main diagonal is not monochromatic. The pattern `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` appears 3 times, starting earliest at (2,2). However, other 2x2 patterns (e.g., `[[2, 2], [2, 2]]`) appear more frequently (7 times) and start earlier (at (0,0)). This example contradicts the simple \"most frequent, earliest position\" rule observed in Example 2. There seems to be a more complex selection criterion when the diagonal isn't monochromatic, which doesn't solely prioritize frequency or first position. The selection of `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` might involve other factors like the sum of elements, the number of unique elements within the pattern, or context within the grid (like adjacency to monochromatic lines), although simple versions of these tie-breakers didn't consistently explain Example 3.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
