Task: Pattern identification from a grid

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Rectangular shape (Height H, Width W)
    - Elements are single digits (0-9)
    - Size varies (e.g., 4x4, 5x5, 7x7)

Output:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Rectangular shape (typically smaller than input)
    - Elements are single digits
    - Size varies (e.g., 1x1, 2x2)

Relationships_and_Actions:
  - Rule_Case_1: # Applies to train_1
      Condition: Input grid's main diagonal is monochromatic (all elements are the same).
      Action: Output a 1x1 grid containing the single element value from the main diagonal.
  - Rule_Case_2: # Applies to train_2 and train_3, but logic is complex/uncertain for train_3
      Condition: Input grid's main diagonal is NOT monochromatic.
      Intermediate_Step: Identify all possible 2x2 subgrids within the input grid.
      Intermediate_Step_Property: Calculate the frequency of occurrence for each unique 2x2 subgrid.
      Intermediate_Step_Property: Determine the first occurrence position (top-left corner, row then column index) for each unique 2x2 subgrid.
      Action: Select the 2x2 subgrid based on prioritization criteria (Uncertainty exists here based on train_3):
        - Hypothesis_A (fits train_2, fails train_3): Prioritize highest frequency, then earliest position.
        # - Hypothesis_B (fits train_2, fails train_3): Prioritize highest frequency, then highest sum, then earliest position.
        # - Other complex criteria might be involved, potentially relating to element composition or grid context.
      Output: The selected 2x2 subgrid.

Derived_Objects:
  - Main_Diagonal: Sequence of elements from top-left to bottom-right.
  - Subgrid_2x2: A 2x2 section of the main grid.
  - Frequency: Count of occurrences of a specific subgrid.
  - Position: Top-left coordinates (row, col) of a subgrid occurrence.
  # - Sum: Sum of the elements within a subgrid. # (Considered as potential tie-breaker)
  # - Unique_Elements: Count of distinct digits within a subgrid. # (Considered as potential tie-breaker)

Uncertainties:
  - The exact selection criteria for the 2x2 subgrid when the main diagonal is not monochromatic are not fully resolved by the examples, particularly due to train_3 where a less frequent pattern is chosen over more frequent ones. The simple prioritization rules tested do not cover all cases.
