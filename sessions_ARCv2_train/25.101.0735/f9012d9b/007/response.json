If the main diagonal exists (grid is not empty) AND all elements on the main diagonal are identical:\n    a.  The output is a 1x1 grid containing that single identical element value.\n3.  Otherwise (main diagonal has different elements, is empty, or grid is too small):\n    a.  Check if the input grid height or width is less than 2. If yes, output an empty grid.\n    b.  If the grid is 2x2 or larger, identify all unique 2x2 subgrid patterns within it.\n    c.  For each unique 2x2 pattern, calculate:\n        i.  Its `sum` (total of its four elements).\n        ii. Its `frequency` (how many times it appears).\n        iii. Its `last_position` (the row and column index of the top-left corner of its final appearance, found by scanning the grid row by row, then column by column).\n    d.  Find the maximum `sum` among all unique patterns.\n    e.  Filter the patterns, keeping only those whose `sum` equals the maximum `sum`.\n    f.  Among these filtered patterns, find the minimum `frequency`.\n    g.  Filter the patterns again, keeping only those that have the minimum `frequency` (among those with the maximum `sum`).\n    h.  If only one pattern remains, select it.\n    i.  If multiple patterns remain (tied on maximum `sum` and minimum `frequency`), compare their `last_position` values. Select the pattern whose `last_position` has the largest row index. If there's still a tie (same largest row index), select the one among them with the largest column index.\n    j.  The selected 2x2 pattern is the output.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef get_main_diagonal(grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"Extracts the main diagonal elements from a grid.\"\"\"\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    size = min(rows, cols)\n    return [grid[i][i] for i in range(size)]\n\ndef is_monochromatic(sequence: list[int]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Checks if all elements in a sequence are the same.\"\"\"\n    if not sequence:\n        return True # An empty sequence is considered monochromatic\n    first_element = sequence[0]\n    return all(element == first_element for element in sequence)\n\ndef analyze_subgrids(grid: list[list[int]], subgrid_size: int = 2) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all unique subgrids of a given size, calculating their sum,\n    frequency, and the position of their last occurrence.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input grid (list of lists of ints).\n        subgrid_size: The dimension of the square subgrids to analyze (e.g., 2 for 2x2).\n\n    Returns:\n        A dictionary where keys are subgrid patterns (tuple of tuples) and\n        values are dictionaries containing {'sum', 'freq', 'last_pos'}.\n        Returns an empty dictionary if no subgrids can be formed.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    # Store: {pattern_tuple: {'sum': int, 'freq': int, 'last_pos': (r,c)}}\n    subgrid_info = defaultdict(lambda: {'sum': 0, 'freq': 0, 'last_pos': (-1, -1)})\n\n    if rows < subgrid_size or cols < subgrid_size:\n        return {} # Cannot form subgrids of the specified size\n\n    # Iterate through all possible top-left corners of the subgrid\n    for r in range(rows -
