Task: Identify and extract a specific pattern from an input grid based on rules.

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Rectangular shape (Height H, Width W)
    - Elements are single digits (0-9)
    - Size varies.

Output:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Rectangular shape, smaller than or equal to input.
    - Elements are single digits.
    - Size is determined by rule: 1x1 or 2x2.

Relationships_and_Actions:
  - Rule_Selector: Based on the main diagonal's properties.
  - Rule_Case_1: # Monochromatic Diagonal Rule
      Condition: The main diagonal (elements grid[i][i]) is non-empty and all its elements are identical.
      Action: Output a 1x1 grid containing the single element value from the main diagonal.
  - Rule_Case_2: # Non-Monochromatic Diagonal Rule (or small grid)
      Condition: The main diagonal contains different elements, is empty, or the grid is too small for a 2x2 subgrid.
      Action_If_Too_Small: If Height < 2 or Width < 2, output an empty grid.
      Action_Otherwise:
        1. Identify all unique 2x2 subgrid patterns in the input.
        2. For each unique pattern, calculate its `sum`, `frequency`, and `last_position`.
        3. Determine `max_sum`: The maximum sum among all patterns.
        4. Filter patterns to keep only those with `sum == max_sum` ("Max Sum Set").
        5. Determine `min_freq`: The minimum frequency among patterns in the "Max Sum Set".
        6. Filter "Max Sum Set" to keep only those with `frequency == min_freq` ("Candidate Set").
        7. Tie-breaking: Select the pattern from the "Candidate Set" with the `last_position` that is latest (maximum row index, then maximum column index).
        8. Output the selected 2x2 subgrid pattern.

Derived_Objects:
  - Main_Diagonal: Sequence of elements grid[i][i] for i from 0 to min(H, W) - 1.
  - Subgrid_2x2: A 2x2 section of the main grid, identified by its content (pattern).
  - Properties_of_Subgrid_2x2:
      - Sum: Sum of the 4 elements.
      - Frequency: Count of occurrences of the pattern.
      - Last_Position: Coordinates (row, col) of the top-left corner of the last occurrence (when scanning row by row, then column by column).
