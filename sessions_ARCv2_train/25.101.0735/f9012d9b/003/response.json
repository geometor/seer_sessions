Examine the main diagonal of the input grid (elements from top-left to bottom-right).\n2. If the main diagonal is not empty AND all elements on the main diagonal are identical (monochromatic):\n   a. The output is a 1x1 grid containing that single identical element value.\n3. If the main diagonal is empty, or contains different element values (not monochromatic):\n   a. The output grid size will be 2x2.\n   b. Identify all unique 2x2 subgrids present within the input grid.\n   c. For each unique 2x2 subgrid pattern, count its total number of occurrences (frequency) in the input grid.\n   d. For each unique 2x2 subgrid pattern, find the coordinates (row, column) of the top-left corner of its *first* occurrence (scanning the input grid row by row, then column by column).\n   e. Determine the maximum frequency (`max_freq`) achieved by any 2x2 subgrid pattern.\n   f. Filter the set of unique 2x2 patterns to include only those whose frequency equals `max_freq`.\n   g. If only one pattern remains, select this pattern as the output.\n   h. If multiple patterns remain (tied for maximum frequency), compare their first occurrence positions. Select the pattern whose first occurrence has the smallest row index.\n   i. If there is still a tie (same maximum frequency and same minimum row index), select the pattern among the remaining ties that has the smallest column index for its first occurrence.\n   j. The selected 2x2 subgrid pattern is the output.\n\n(Note: This rule is known to fail test cases 2 and 3 based on previous analysis,\n but accurately reflects the last specified Natural Language Program.)\n\"\"\"\n\ndef get_main_diagonal(grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"Extracts the main diagonal elements from a grid.\"\"\"\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    size = min(rows, cols)\n    return [grid[i][i] for i in range(size)]\n\ndef is_monochromatic(sequence: list[int]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Checks if all elements in a sequence are the same.\"\"\"\n    if not sequence:\n        return True # An empty sequence can be considered monochromatic\n    first_element = sequence[0]\n    return all(element == first_element for element in sequence)\n\ndef get_subgrid(grid: list[list[int]], r: int, c: int, height: int, width: int) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"Extracts a subgrid of specified size starting at (r, c).\"\"\"\n    return [row[c:c+width] for row in grid[r:r+height]]\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    Checks for monochromatic diagonal first.
