**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code, based on the hypothesis derived from Example 1 (monochromatic diagonal) and a simple interpretation of Example 2 (most frequent 2x2, earliest position tie-break), failed on Examples 2 and 3.

*   **Example 2 Failure:** The tie-breaking rule for selecting among the most frequent 2x2 subgrids was incorrect. The code selected the pattern with the earliest first position `(0,0)`, while the correct output's first position was `(1,0)`.
*   **Example 3 Failure:** The primary selection criterion (maximum frequency) was incorrect. The code selected the most frequent pattern (frequency 4), while the correct output had a lower frequency (3).

This indicated that the logic for the non-monochromatic diagonal case needed significant revision. Several alternative hypotheses were considered and tested iteratively against the examples:
1.  Max Frequency -> Latest First Position (Failed Ex 3)
2.  Max Frequency -> Latest Last Position (Failed Ex 3)
3.  Max Sum -> Latest First Position (Failed Ex 2)
4.  Max Sum -> Earliest First Position (Failed Ex 2)
5.  Max Sum -> Latest Last Position (Failed Ex 3)
6.  Contains Grid Mode -> Max Frequency -> Earliest First Position (Failed Ex 2)
7.  Contains Grid Mode -> Max Frequency -> Latest Last Position (Failed Ex 3)
8.  **Max Sum -> Min Frequency -> Latest Last Position (Success!)**

The successful strategy involves prioritizing the 2x2 subgrid with the highest sum of elements. If there's a tie in sum, prioritize the subgrid with the lowest frequency among those tied. If there's still a tie, prioritize the subgrid whose last occurrence appears latest in the grid (maximum row index, then maximum column index). This strategy correctly identifies the output for all three training examples.

**Strategy:**
1.  Implement the final successful hypothesis.
2.  Gather detailed metrics for each example using code execution to support the hypothesis (sum, frequency, first/last positions).
3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect this final, validated rule.

**Metrics Gathering**

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
Task: Identify and extract a specific pattern from an input grid.

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Rectangular shape (Height H, Width W)
    - Elements are single digits (0-9)
    - Size varies.

Output:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Rectangular shape, smaller than or equal to input.
    - Elements are single digits.
    - Size is determined by rule: 1x1 or 2x2.

Relationships_and_Actions:
  - Rule_Case_1: # Applies if the main diagonal is monochromatic
      Condition: The main diagonal (elements grid[i][i]) is non-empty and all its elements are identical.
      Action: Output a 1x1 grid containing the single element value from the main diagonal.
  - Rule_Case_2: # Applies if the main diagonal is not monochromatic or the grid is too small for a diagonal
      Condition: The main diagonal contains different elements, is empty, or the grid cannot form a 2x2 subgrid.
      Action_Output_Size: The output grid will be 2x2 (unless the input is smaller than 2x2, in which case output is likely empty or undefined by examples).
      Action_Selection_Process:
        1. Identify all unique 2x2 subgrids within the input grid.
        2. For each unique 2x2 subgrid pattern, calculate:
            - `sum`: The sum of its four elements.
            - `frequency`: The total count of its occurrences in the input grid.
            - `last_position`: The (row, column) coordinates of the top-left corner of its *last* occurrence when scanning the input grid (row by row, then column by column).
        3. Determine `max_sum`: The highest sum found among all unique 2x2 subgrids.
        4. Filter to keep only the subgrids whose `sum` equals `max_sum`. Let this be the "Max Sum Set".
        5. Determine `min_freq`: The lowest frequency found among the subgrids in the "Max Sum Set".
        6. Filter the "Max Sum Set" to keep only the subgrids whose `frequency` equals `min_freq`. Let this be the "Candidate Set".
        7. If the "Candidate Set" contains only one subgrid, select that subgrid.
        8. If the "Candidate Set" contains multiple subgrids (tied on max sum and min frequency), select the subgrid whose `last_position` is the "latest" (highest row index, breaking ties with the highest column index).
        9. Output the selected 2x2 subgrid pattern.

Derived_Objects:
  - Main_Diagonal: Sequence of elements grid[i][i] for i from 0 to min(H, W) - 1.
  - Subgrid_2x2: A 2x2 section of the main grid, identified by its content (pattern).
  - Properties_of_Subgrid_2x2:
      - Sum: Sum of the 4 elements.
      - Frequency: Count of occurrences of the pattern.
      - First_Position: Coordinates (row, col) of the first occurrence.
      - Last_Position: Coordinates (row, col) of the last occurrence.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Examine the main diagonal of the input grid (elements from top-left to bottom-right).
2.  If the main diagonal is not empty AND all elements on the main diagonal are identical:
    a.  The output is a 1x1 grid containing that identical element value.
3.  Otherwise (if the main diagonal has different elements, is empty, or the grid is smaller than 2x2):
    a.  If the input grid is smaller than 2x2 in height or width, return an empty grid (as no 2x2 subgrid can be formed).
    b.  Identify all unique 2x2 subgrid patterns present in the input grid.
    c.  For each unique 2x2 pattern, calculate three properties:
        i.  Its sum (total of its four elements).
        ii. Its frequency (how many times it appears in the input grid).
        iii. Its last position (the row and column index of the top-left corner of its final appearance when scanning the grid row by row, then column by column).
    d.  Find the maximum sum achieved by any 2x2 pattern.
    e.  Consider only those patterns that have this maximum sum.
    f.  Among these maximum-sum patterns, find the minimum frequency.
    g.  Consider only those patterns that have both the maximum sum and this minimum frequency.
    h.  If only one pattern remains, select this pattern.
    i.  If multiple patterns remain (tied on maximum sum and minimum frequency), compare their last positions. Select the pattern whose last position has the largest row index. If there's still a tie (same largest row index), select the one among them with the largest column index.
    j.  The selected 2x2 pattern is the output.
