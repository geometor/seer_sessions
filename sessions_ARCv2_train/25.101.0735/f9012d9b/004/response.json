The code selected the pattern with the earliest first position `(0,0)`, while the correct output's first position was `(1,0)`.\n*   **Example 3 Failure:** The primary selection criterion (maximum frequency) was incorrect. The code selected the most frequent pattern (frequency 4), while the correct output had a lower frequency (3).\n\nThis indicated that the logic for the non-monochromatic diagonal case needed significant revision. Several alternative hypotheses were considered and tested iteratively against the examples:\n1.  Max Frequency -> Latest First Position (Failed Ex 3)\n2.  Max Frequency -> Latest Last Position (Failed Ex 3)\n3.  Max Sum -> Latest First Position (Failed Ex 2)\n4.  Max Sum -> Earliest First Position (Failed Ex 2)\n5.  Max Sum -> Latest Last Position (Failed Ex 3)\n6.  Contains Grid Mode -> Max Frequency -> Earliest First Position (Failed Ex 2)\n7.  Contains Grid Mode -> Max Frequency -> Latest Last Position (Failed Ex 3)\n8.  **Max Sum -> Min Frequency -> Latest Last Position (Success!)**\n\nThe successful strategy involves prioritizing the 2x2 subgrid with the highest sum of elements. If there's a tie in sum, prioritize the subgrid with the lowest frequency among those tied. If there's still a tie, prioritize the subgrid whose last occurrence appears latest in the grid (maximum row index, then maximum column index). This strategy correctly identifies the output for all three training examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Implement the final successful hypothesis.\n2.  Gather detailed metrics for each example using code execution to support the hypothesis (sum, frequency, first/last positions).\n3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect this final, validated rule.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nThe following code analyzes the 2x2 subgrids for Examples 2 and 3, focusing on the properties relevant to the final hypothesis (sum, frequency, last position).\n\n*code_execution:*\n"
