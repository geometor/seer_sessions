**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Data:** The input is a rectangular grid (matrix) of single digits (0-9). The grid sizes vary across examples (4x4, 5x5, 7x7).
2.  **Output Data:** The output is also a rectangular grid of single digits. The output size is smaller than the input size and varies (1x1, 2x2, 2x2).
3.  **Core Task:** The goal appears to be identifying a representative pattern or characteristic from the input grid and outputting it.
4.  **Observed Patterns/Logic:**
    *   **Example 1:** The input is 4x4, the output is 1x1 ('8'). The main diagonal of the input is `[8, 8, 8, 8]`. This suggests a rule related to monochromatic diagonals might apply.
    *   **Example 2:** The input is 5x5, the output is 2x2 (`[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`). The main diagonal is not monochromatic. The output pattern `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` appears 3 times in the input, starting earliest at position (1,0). Another pattern `[[1, 1], [1, 2]]` also appears 3 times, starting earliest at (1,1). The output seems to be the most frequent 2x2 pattern, with ties broken by the earliest starting position (row first, then column).
    *   **Example 3:** The input is 7x7, the output is 2x2 (`[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`). The main diagonal is not monochromatic. The pattern `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` appears 3 times, starting earliest at (2,2). However, other 2x2 patterns (e.g., `[[2, 2], [2, 2]]`) appear more frequently (7 times) and start earlier (at (0,0)). This example contradicts the simple "most frequent, earliest position" rule observed in Example 2. There seems to be a more complex selection criterion when the diagonal isn't monochromatic, which doesn't solely prioritize frequency or first position. The selection of `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` might involve other factors like the sum of elements, the number of unique elements within the pattern, or context within the grid (like adjacency to monochromatic lines), although simple versions of these tie-breakers didn't consistently explain Example 3.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
Task: Pattern identification from a grid

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Rectangular shape (Height H, Width W)
    - Elements are single digits (0-9)
    - Size varies (e.g., 4x4, 5x5, 7x7)

Output:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Rectangular shape (typically smaller than input)
    - Elements are single digits
    - Size varies (e.g., 1x1, 2x2)

Relationships_and_Actions:
  - Rule_Case_1: # Applies to train_1
      Condition: Input grid's main diagonal is monochromatic (all elements are the same).
      Action: Output a 1x1 grid containing the single element value from the main diagonal.
  - Rule_Case_2: # Applies to train_2 and train_3, but logic is complex/uncertain for train_3
      Condition: Input grid's main diagonal is NOT monochromatic.
      Intermediate_Step: Identify all possible 2x2 subgrids within the input grid.
      Intermediate_Step_Property: Calculate the frequency of occurrence for each unique 2x2 subgrid.
      Intermediate_Step_Property: Determine the first occurrence position (top-left corner, row then column index) for each unique 2x2 subgrid.
      Action: Select the 2x2 subgrid based on prioritization criteria (Uncertainty exists here based on train_3):
        - Hypothesis_A (fits train_2, fails train_3): Prioritize highest frequency, then earliest position.
        # - Hypothesis_B (fits train_2, fails train_3): Prioritize highest frequency, then highest sum, then earliest position.
        # - Other complex criteria might be involved, potentially relating to element composition or grid context.
      Output: The selected 2x2 subgrid.

Derived_Objects:
  - Main_Diagonal: Sequence of elements from top-left to bottom-right.
  - Subgrid_2x2: A 2x2 section of the main grid.
  - Frequency: Count of occurrences of a specific subgrid.
  - Position: Top-left coordinates (row, col) of a subgrid occurrence.
  # - Sum: Sum of the elements within a subgrid. # (Considered as potential tie-breaker)
  # - Unique_Elements: Count of distinct digits within a subgrid. # (Considered as potential tie-breaker)

Uncertainties:
  - The exact selection criteria for the 2x2 subgrid when the main diagonal is not monochromatic are not fully resolved by the examples, particularly due to train_3 where a less frequent pattern is chosen over more frequent ones. The simple prioritization rules tested do not cover all cases.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the main diagonal of the input grid (elements from top-left to bottom-right).
2.  If all elements on the main diagonal are identical:
    a.  The output is a 1x1 grid containing that identical element value.
3.  If the elements on the main diagonal are not all identical:
    a.  Identify all unique 2x2 subgrids present in the input grid.
    b.  For each unique 2x2 subgrid, count its total number of occurrences (frequency) within the input grid.
    c.  For each unique 2x2 subgrid, find the coordinates (row, column) of the top-left corner of its first occurrence (scanning the input grid row by row, then column by column).
    d.  Determine the maximum frequency (`Fmax`) achieved by any 2x2 subgrid.
    e.  Select all 2x2 subgrids that have this maximum frequency `Fmax`.
    f.  If only one subgrid has frequency `Fmax`, this subgrid is the output.
    g.  If multiple subgrids share the maximum frequency `Fmax`, compare their first occurrence positions. Select the subgrid whose first occurrence has the smallest row index. If there's still a tie, select the one among them with the smallest column index.
    h.  The selected 2x2 subgrid is the output.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code successfully implemented the hypothesis derived from Example 1 (monochromatic diagonal). However, testing against Examples 2 and 3 revealed that this hypothesis, particularly the rule for non-monochromatic diagonals (select the most frequent 2x2 subgrid, breaking ties with the earliest position), is incorrect or incomplete.

*   **Example 1:** Passed. The monochromatic diagonal rule seems correct.
*   **Example 2:** Failed. The code identified the correct set of most frequent 2x2 subgrids (frequency 3), but the tie-breaking rule (earliest position: row 0, col 0) selected `[[2, 1], [1, 1]]` instead of the expected `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]` (first position: row 1, col 0). This indicates the tie-breaking mechanism is different from the initial assumption.
*   **Example 3:** Failed Significantly. The code selected the most frequent 2x2 subgrid (`[[2, 2], [2, 2]]`, frequency 7, position 0,0). The expected output (`[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`) has a much lower frequency (3) and starts later (position 2,2). This strongly suggests that maximum frequency is *not* the primary selection criterion when the diagonal is not monochromatic.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Retain Rule 1:** Keep the rule for monochromatic diagonals as it passed Example 1.
2.  **Re-evaluate Rule 2:** The rule for non-monochromatic diagonals needs significant revision. The simple "most frequent, earliest position" logic is insufficient. Various alternatives were considered (highest sum, grid mode/max value inclusion, different position tie-breakers, etc.), but none consistently explained both Example 2 and Example 3.
3.  **Focus on Reporting:** Since a definitive rule for Case 2 cannot be confidently determined from the provided examples, the best approach is to:
    *   Accurately document the observed frequencies and positions for relevant patterns using code execution.
    *   Clearly state the failure points of the previous hypothesis.
    *   Update the Natural Language Program and YAML to reflect the current best guess (the one implemented), while explicitly highlighting its known failures and the unresolved ambiguity in the selection criteria for non-monochromatic cases. This provides clear context for the next phase.

*(Correction Note: The code execution results above show slightly different frequencies for Example 3 than manually calculated during thought process, likely due to edge effects or counting errors in manual check. The code execution is assumed correct. `[[2, 2], [2, 2]]` has freq 4, not 7. Several patterns have freq 4. The expected output `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` has freq 3.)*

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
Task: Pattern identification and extraction from a grid.

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Rectangular shape (Height H, Width W)
    - Elements are single digits (0-9)
    - Size varies (e.g., 4x4, 5x5, 7x7)

Output:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Rectangular shape, smaller than or equal to input.
    - Elements are single digits.
    - Size determined by rule: 1x1 or 2x2 based on input's main diagonal.

Relationships_and_Actions:
  - Rule_Case_1: # Applies to train_1 (Passed)
      Condition: Input grid's main diagonal is monochromatic (all elements are the same).
      Action: Output a 1x1 grid containing the single element value from the main diagonal.
  - Rule_Case_2: # Applies to train_2 (Failed), train_3 (Failed)
      Condition: Input grid's main diagonal is NOT monochromatic.
      Action_Output_Size: The output grid will be 2x2.
      Action_Selection_Sub_Problem: Identify the specific 2x2 subgrid to output.
      # --- Current Implemented Hypothesis (Failed on Ex2, Ex3) ---
      Hypothesis_Action:
        - Find all unique 2x2 subgrids within the input.
        - Calculate the frequency of occurrence for each unique 2x2 subgrid.
        - Determine the first occurrence position (top-left corner: row, then column index) for each unique 2x2 subgrid.
        - Select the 2x2 subgrid with the highest frequency.
        - If multiple subgrids share the highest frequency, select the one whose first occurrence has the smallest row index.
        - If there is still a tie, select the one among them with the smallest column index.
      Hypothesis_Failure_Ex2: Tied on max frequency (3). Expected output ((1, 1), (2, 1)) at (1,0). Hypothesis selected ((2, 1), (1, 1)) at (0,0) due to earlier row index.
      Hypothesis_Failure_Ex3: Expected output ((5, 5), (5, 2)) has frequency 3, first pos (2,2). Hypothesis selected ((2, 2), (2, 2)) which has frequency 4 (the max) and first pos (0,0). Maximum frequency is not the correct primary criterion.
      # --- End Current Hypothesis ---
      Uncertainty: The correct criteria for selecting the 2x2 subgrid in this case remain unknown. It does not appear to be solely based on maximizing frequency or minimizing first position. Other factors (e.g., element sum, relationship to grid features, different tie-breaking) might be involved, but no tested alternative consistently explains all examples.

Derived_Objects:
  - Main_Diagonal: Sequence of elements from top-left to bottom-right.
  - Subgrid_2x2: A 2x2 section of the main grid, identified by its content and potentially its occurrences.
  - Frequency: Count of occurrences of a specific 2x2 subgrid pattern.
  - Position: Top-left coordinates (row, col) of a subgrid occurrence.
  - First_Position: The position (row, col) of the first time a specific 2x2 pattern appears when scanning the input grid row by row, then column by column.
  - Sum: Sum of the 4 elements within a 2x2 subgrid (considered as potential factor).
```


**Natural Language Program**

*(Note: This program describes the logic implemented in the previous code attempt. It is known to fail Examples 2 and 3, but represents the current state of understanding before further revision based on the failure analysis.)*

1.  Examine the main diagonal of the input grid (elements from `grid[0][0]`, `grid[1][1]`, ...).
2.  If the main diagonal is not empty AND all elements on the main diagonal are identical (monochromatic):
    a.  The output is a 1x1 grid containing that single identical element value.
3.  If the main diagonal is empty, or contains different element values (not monochromatic):
    a.  The output grid size will be 2x2.
    b.  Identify all unique 2x2 subgrids present within the input grid.
    c.  For each unique 2x2 subgrid pattern, count its total number of occurrences (frequency) in the input grid.
    d.  For each unique 2x2 subgrid pattern, find the coordinates (row, column) of the top-left corner of its *first* occurrence (scanning the input grid row by row, then column by column).
    e.  Determine the maximum frequency (`max_freq`) achieved by any 2x2 subgrid pattern.
    f.  Filter the set of unique 2x2 patterns to include only those whose frequency equals `max_freq`.
    g.  If only one pattern remains, select this pattern as the output.
    h.  If multiple patterns remain (tied for maximum frequency), compare their first occurrence positions. Select the pattern whose first occurrence has the smallest row index.
    i.  If there is still a tie (same maximum frequency and same minimum row index), select the pattern among the remaining ties that has the smallest column index for its first occurrence.
    j.  The selected 2x2 subgrid pattern is the output.

*(Self-Correction Note: The rule described in step 3 fails Example 2 due to incorrect tie-breaking logic and fails Example 3 because the primary criterion (maximum frequency) appears to be wrong. The actual selection logic for the 2x2 subgrid in the non-monochromatic case needs to be fundamentally re-evaluated.)*
