## Perception of Elements

The task involves transforming a 3x3 input grid containing the integers 0 and 2 into a single output integer, which is either 1 or 7. The core logic appears to relate to the spatial arrangement and symmetry properties of the '2's within the grid.

## YAML Fact Document


```yaml
Task: Grid Symmetry Detection

Input:
  Type: object
  Description: A 3x3 grid (matrix) of integers.
  Properties:
    - dimensions: 3x3
    - cell_values: Contains integers 0 or 2.
    - arrangement: The specific spatial pattern of 0s and 2s.

Output:
  Type: integer
  Description: A single integer value indicating a property of the input grid's pattern.
  Possible_Values: [1, 7]

Transformation:
  Name: CheckGridSymmetry
  Description: Analyzes the symmetry of the input grid pattern.
  Logic:
    - If the grid pattern exhibits any of the specified symmetries (Horizontal, Vertical, Diagonal, Anti-Diagonal, 180-degree Rotational), the output is 1.
    - If the grid pattern does not exhibit any of these symmetries, the output is 7.
  Relationships:
    - The output value is directly dependent on the presence or absence of symmetry in the input grid.

Symmetry_Types:
  - Horizontal: Reflection across the horizontal midline (grid[i][j] == grid[2-i][j]).
  - Vertical: Reflection across the vertical midline (grid[i][j] == grid[i][2-j]).
  - Diagonal (Main): Reflection across the main diagonal (grid[i][j] == grid[j][i]).
  - Anti-Diagonal: Reflection across the anti-diagonal (grid[i][j] == grid[2-j][2-i]).
  - Rotational (180): 180-degree rotation (grid[i][j] == grid[2-i][2-j]).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Receive** the 3x3 input grid.
2.  **Check** if the grid pattern has horizontal symmetry (reflecting across the middle row preserves the pattern).
3.  **Check** if the grid pattern has vertical symmetry (reflecting across the middle column preserves the pattern).
4.  **Check** if the grid pattern has main diagonal symmetry (reflecting across the top-left to bottom-right diagonal preserves the pattern).
5.  **Check** if the grid pattern has anti-diagonal symmetry (reflecting across the top-right to bottom-left diagonal preserves the pattern).
6.  **Check** if the grid pattern has 180-degree rotational symmetry (rotating the grid 180 degrees preserves the pattern).
7.  **If** any of the symmetry checks from steps 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 are true, **output** the integer `1`.
8.  **Otherwise** (if none of the symmetry checks are true), **output** the integer `7`.
