The grid dimensions vary across examples.\n    *   The output is always a 2x2 grid of single-digit integers.\n    *   The numbers in the output grid are directly taken from the input grid; no arithmetic operations seem to be involved.\n    *   The output grid corresponds to a specific 2x2 subgrid within the input grid.\n    *   The location of the selected 2x2 subgrid appears to depend on the dimensions of the input grid. Specifically, it seems to depend on whether both the number of rows and the number of columns are even.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
