            "text": "*   **Assessment:** The previous code failed because it assumed the `transform` function would receive a raw string representation of the grid and attempted to parse it using `parse_input`. However, the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` indicates that the `transform` function was actually called with an already parsed `numpy.ndarray` object. The core logic of iterating through the grid and collecting non-zero elements appears correct based on the input/output examples. The strategy is to modify the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array directly, removing the redundant parsing step.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    The core transformation logic (extracting non-zero elements in row-major order) holds true for all examples:\n    *   **train_1:** Input grid has one non-zero element (7). Output is \"7\".\n    *   **train_2:** Input grid has three non-zero elements (2, 2, 2). Output is \"2 2 2\".\n    *   **train_3:** Input grid has four non-zero elements (8, 8, 8, 8). Output is \"8 8 8 8\".\n    *   **train_4:** Input grid has two non-zero elements (1, 1). Output is \"1 1\".\n    The error occurred before this logic could be executed due to the incorrect assumption about the input type passed to the `transform` function.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
