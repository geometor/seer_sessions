```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transforms a 1D NumPy array by swapping specific adjacent pairs of elements.
The transformation iterates through the array indices. If an index `i` is 
a multiple of 3 (i.e., i=0, 3, 6, ...), the elements at indices `i` and `i+1` 
are swapped, provided that `i+1` is a valid index within the array. 
Elements at indices not involved in these specific swaps (i.e., indices 2, 5, 8, ...) 
remain in their positions relative to the swapped blocks.
