objects:
  - name: input_string
    type: multi-line string
    properties:
      - each line contains a number representation
  - name: output_string
    type: multi-line string
    properties:
      - each line contains a number representation
  - name: number_list
    type: ordered list
    source: derived from input_string by splitting lines and converting to numbers (or keeping as strings)
  - name: adjacent_pair
    type: tuple or sublist
    properties:
      - contains two consecutive elements from the number_list (e.g., at index i and i+1)
  - name: last_element (optional)
    type: number or string
    properties:
      - exists only if number_list has an odd number of elements
      - corresponds to the final element in the list

actions:
  - name: parse_input
    input: input_string
    output: number_list
    description: Splits the input string by newline characters to create a list of items.
  - name: iterate_and_swap
    input: number_list
    output: modified_number_list
    description: >
      Iterates through the number_list with a step of 2.
      For each pair of elements at indices `i` and `i+1`, it swaps their positions in the list.
      If the list has an odd number of elements, the last element is not part of any pair and remains untouched by the swapping action.
  - name: format_output
    input: modified_number_list
    output: output_string
    description: Joins the elements of the modified list with newline characters to create the output string.

relationships:
  - The output_string represents the modified_number_list formatted as a multi-line string.
  - The modified_number_list is derived from the number_list by applying the iterate_and_swap action.
  - The number_list is derived from the input_string by applying the parse_input action.
  - The order of elements in the output depends directly on the swapping of adjacent pairs in the input.
