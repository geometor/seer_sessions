  objects:
    - name: input_list
      type: ordered list
      description: A list of elements derived from the input (e.g., numbers or strings). Represents the grid or multi-line string input.
      properties:
        - ordered
        - contains elements (e.g., numbers)
    - name: output_list
      type: ordered list
      description: The transformed list of elements, maintaining the same size as the input list.
      properties:
        - ordered
        - contains elements (potentially reordered)
        - same size as input_list
    - name: element_pair_to_swap
      type: tuple or sublist
      description: A pair of elements at specific indices (i, i+1) designated for swapping.
      properties:
        - consists of two adjacent elements
        - indices are of the form (0,1), (3,4), (6,7), ... ; specifically, `(3k, 3k+1)` for k=0, 1, 2,... where `3k+1` is within list bounds.
    - name: element_to_keep
      type: single element
      description: An element at an index that is not part of a pair being swapped.
      properties:
        - located at indices 2, 5, 8, ... ; specifically, `3k+2` for k=0, 1, 2,... where `3k+2` is within list bounds.
        - position relative to surrounding swapped blocks is maintained.

  actions:
    - name: parse_input
      input: raw_input (e.g., multi-line string or grid representation)
      output: input_list
      description: Converts the raw input into an ordered list format.
    - name: iterate_and_conditionally_swap
      input: input_list
      output: output_list
      description: >
        Creates a copy of the input list.
        Iterates through the list indices `i`.
        If the index `i` is such that `i % 3 == 0` and `i+1` is a valid index within the list,
        it swaps the elements at index `i` and `i+1` in the copied list.
        Elements at indices `i` where `i % 3 == 2`, and any trailing elements not part of a `(3k, 3k+1)` pair, are left unchanged.
    - name: format_output
      input: output_list
      output: raw_output (e.g., multi-line string or grid representation)
      description: Converts the transformed list back into the required output format.

  relationships:
    - The output_list is derived from the input_list by applying the iterate_and_conditionally_swap action.
    - The order of elements in the output depends on selectively swapping pairs at indices (0,1), (3,4), etc., while leaving elements at indices 2, 5, etc., untouched.
    - The input and output have the same number of elements.
    - The set and count of unique element values remain the same between input and output (it's purely a reordering).
