task_description: Generate two output sequences by alternating elements derived from the rows of an input NumPy array.
input_structure:
  type: numpy.ndarray
  shape: (2, N) where N is the number of elements per original line.
  dtype: integer
  row_1_property: Contains repetitions of a single number (num1).
  row_2_property: Contains repetitions of a different single number (num2).
output_structure:
  type: text
  lines: 2
  elements_per_line: multiple, space-separated, N elements each.
  element_type: string representation of integers.
transformation:
  data_extraction:
    num1: The unique integer value in the first row (index 0) of the input array.
    num2: The unique integer value in the second row (index 1) of the input array.
    length: The number of columns (N) in the input array (shape[1]).
  line_1_output_generation:
    pattern: Alternating sequence of num1 and num2.
    start_element: num1
    length: N
  line_2_output_generation:
    pattern: Alternating sequence of num2 and num1.
    start_element: num2
    length: N
  output_formatting:
    - Convert generated sequences of numbers into sequences of strings.
    - Join elements of each sequence with spaces.
    - Combine the two resulting strings with a newline character in between.
relationships:
  - Output elements are derived solely from the two unique numbers (`num1`, `num2`) in the input array rows.
  - Output sequence length (`N`) is determined by the number of columns in the input array.
  - The starting element of each output line corresponds to the number in the respective input row.
