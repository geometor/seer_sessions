```python
import math

"""
Transforms the input list by swapping adjacent pairs of elements. 
Iterates through the list with a step of 2 (indices 0, 2, 4, ...). 
For each starting index 'i', if the next index 'i+1' is within the list bounds, 
the elements at indices 'i' and 'i+1' are swapped. 
If the list has an odd number of elements, the last element remains in its position.
The input is expected as a list of lists, where each inner list contains one integer, 
representing the digits line by line. The transformation operates on the sequence 
of these integers. The output is formatted similarly as a list of lists.
