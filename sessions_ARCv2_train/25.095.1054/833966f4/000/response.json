Element at index 2 remains. Elements at indices (3, 4) are swapped.\n*   **Transformation Pattern (`train_2`):**\n    *   Input: `[4, 3, 6, 2, 8]`\n    *   Output: `[3, 4, 6, 8, 2]`\n    *   Comparing element positions:\n        *   `4` (index 0) moves to index 1.\n        *   `3` (index 1) moves to index 0.\n        *   `6` (index 2) stays at index 2.\n        *   `2` (index 3) moves to index 4.\n        *   `8` (index 4) moves to index 3.\n    *   Observation: Elements at indices (0, 1) are swapped. Element at index 2 remains. Elements at indices (3, 4) are swapped.\n*   **General Observation:** The transformation appears to swap adjacent pairs of elements in the list. It iterates through the list, taking elements two at a time (index 0 and 1, then index 2 and 3, etc.) and swaps their positions. If the list has an odd number of elements, the last element remains in its original position.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
