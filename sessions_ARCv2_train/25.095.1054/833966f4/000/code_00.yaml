objects:
  - name: input_list
    type: list
    properties:
      - elements: integers
      - order: significant
  - name: output_list
    type: list
    properties:
      - elements: integers (same set as input_list)
      - order: derived from input_list
actions:
  - name: swap_adjacent_pairs
    description: Iterates through the input list, swapping elements at indices i and i+1 for i = 0, 2, 4, ...
    condition: Only proceeds if index i+1 is within the list bounds.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_list
    output: output_list
    rule: The output_list is generated by applying the swap_adjacent_pairs action to the input_list. Elements that are not part of a pair (i.e., the last element of an odd-length list) retain their original position relative to the start of the processing.
