objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - elements: integers
      - order: significant
      - length: variable (e.g., 5 in examples)
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - elements: integers (same set as input_sequence)
      - order: derived from input_sequence
      - length: same as input_sequence
actions:
  - name: process_in_groups_of_three
    description: Iterates through the input sequence using a step of 3 (indices 0, 3, 6, ...).
  - name: swap_first_two_in_group
    description: For the current group starting at index i, if index i+1 exists, swap the elements at index i and i+1.
    condition: Only proceeds if index i+1 is within the sequence bounds.
    effect: Modifies the sequence being built. The element at index i+2 (if it exists) is not involved in the swap and maintains its position relative to the start of the group.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: The output_sequence is generated by applying the process_in_groups_of_three action to a copy of the input_sequence. Within each group identified, the swap_first_two_in_group action is performed. If the sequence length is not a multiple of 3, the remaining 1 or 2 elements at the end are processed as the final group: if 2 elements remain, they are swapped; if 1 element remains, it is left unchanged.
