"""
Transforms the input sequence by processing it in groups of three elements. 
For each group starting at index i (where i = 0, 3, 6, ...), 
if the next element (at index i+1) exists, the elements at indices i and i+1 are swapped. 
The element at index i+2 (if it exists) remains in its relative position within the group. 
If the sequence length is not a multiple of 3, the remaining one or two elements are handled: 
if one element remains, it is left unchanged; if two elements remain, they are swapped.
The input is a list of single-element lists, which is flattened, transformed, 
and then reformatted back into a list of single-element lists.

    Applies a transformation rule involving swapping elements within groups of three.

    Args:
        input_grid: A list of lists, where each inner list contains a single integer.
