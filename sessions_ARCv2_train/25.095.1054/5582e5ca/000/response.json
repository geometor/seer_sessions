A key observation is that the output grid is always uniform, consisting of a single digit repeated in all cells. This repeated digit appears to be derived from the input grid. By examining the examples, the digit chosen for the output grid is the one that appears most frequently in the input grid.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
