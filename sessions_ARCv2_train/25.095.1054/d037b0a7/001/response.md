```python
import copy

"""
Transforms a grid by propagating non-zero values downwards within each column. 
If a cell contains 0 (background) and the cell directly above it (or any cell further up in the same column, with only 0s in between) contains a non-zero value, the 0 is replaced by that non-zero value. This process repeats downwards within each column independently.
