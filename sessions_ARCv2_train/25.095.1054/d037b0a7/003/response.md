```python
"""
Transforms a grid by propagating non-zero values downwards within each column. 
If a cell contains 0 (background) and a non-zero value ("color") exists above it 
in the same column (potentially separated by other 0s), the 0 cell in the output 
grid takes the value of the most recently encountered non-zero value above it in 
that column. This process occurs independently for each column. Original non-zero 
values remain in their positions.
