            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe provided code attempts to implement the previously derived logic: extract the top-left 2x2 subgrid if the input column count is odd, and the top-right 2x2 subgrid if the column count is even. However, the code fails on all examples with the error: \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\".\n\nThis specific error message strongly suggests that the `input_grid` variable, within the testing environment where the code was executed, is being treated as a NumPy array, not a standard Python list of lists as assumed in the pure Python code. The expression `if not input_grid:` is likely the source of the error. When `input_grid` is a non-empty NumPy array, its truth value is ambiguous, leading to the exception.\n\nThe core logic regarding the selection based on column parity seems consistent with the examples. The strategy is to refine the understanding of the input type (likely NumPy array) and adjust the implementation details (like the emptiness check) accordingly, while maintaining the core transformation rule.\n\n**Metrics and Execution Analysis:**\n\nNo specific code execution is needed to gather basic metrics, as they can be derived from the problem description. The error analysis points directly to the input handling.\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input 4x4 (even columns), Output 2x2 (top-right). Expected logic: Extract `[[input[0][2], input[0][3]], [input[1][2], input[1][3]]]`. Error suggests `input_grid` was treated as a NumPy array.\n*   **Example 2:** Input 3x3 (odd columns), Output 2x2 (top-left). Expected logic: Extract `[[input[0][0], input[0][1]], [input[1][0], input[1][1]]]`. Error suggests `input_grid` was treated as a NumPy array.\n*   **Example 3:** Input 5x5 (odd columns), Output 2x2 (top-left). Expected logic: Extract `[[input[0][0], input[0][1]], [input[1][0], input[1][1]]]`. Error suggests `input_grid` was treated as a NumPy array.\n\nThe consistent error across all examples reinforces the hypothesis that the issue lies in the initial handling of the `input_grid` variable, specifically the `if not input_grid:` check when dealing with a NumPy array type.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
