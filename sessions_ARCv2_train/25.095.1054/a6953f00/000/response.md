Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input:** The input is a grid (matrix) of single-digit integers, represented as space-separated values on multiple lines. The dimensions (rows and columns) of the input grid vary across examples.
2.  **Output:** The output is always a 2x2 grid of single-digit integers, also represented as space-separated values on two lines.
3.  **Transformation:** The core task is to extract a specific 2x2 subgrid from the input grid.
4.  **Selection Logic:** The key challenge is determining *which* 2x2 subgrid to extract. Comparing the examples reveals a pattern based on the input grid's dimensions:
    *   In `train_1` (4x4 input), the top-right 2x2 subgrid (`[[8, 2], [4, 7]]`) is selected. The number of columns (4) is even.
    *   In `train_2` (3x3 input), the top-left 2x2 subgrid (`[[0, 7], [5, 6]]`) is selected. The number of columns (3) is odd.
    *   In `train_3` (5x5 input), the top-left 2x2 subgrid (`[[5, 8], [8, 0]]`) is selected. The number of columns (5) is odd.
5.  **Conclusion:** The selection rule appears to depend on the parity (even or odd) of the number of columns in the input grid. If the number of columns is even, the top-right 2x2 subgrid is extracted. If the number of columns is odd, the top-left 2x2 subgrid is extracted.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - elements: integers
      - rows: variable number (R)
      - columns: variable number (C)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - elements: integers
      - rows: fixed number (2)
      - columns: fixed number (2)

relationships:
  - type: derivation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    details: output_grid is a 2x2 subgrid extracted from the top two rows of input_grid.

actions:
  - name: determine_input_columns
    input: input_grid
    output: number_of_columns (C)
  - name: check_column_parity
    input: number_of_columns (C)
    output: parity (even or odd)
  - name: extract_subgrid
    input: input_grid, parity
    output: output_grid
    logic: |
      If parity is 'odd', extract the top-left 2x2 subgrid:
      [[input[0][0], input[0][1]],
       [input[1][0], input[1][1]]]
      If parity is 'even', extract the top-right 2x2 subgrid:
      [[input[0][C-2], input[0][C-1]],
       [input[1][C-2], input[1][C-1]]]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input into a grid of integers.
2.  Count the number of columns (`C`) in the input grid.
3.  Determine if `C` is even or odd.
4.  If `C` is odd:
    *   Identify the elements at row 0, column 0 and row 0, column 1.
    *   Identify the elements at row 1, column 0 and row 1, column 1.
    *   Construct the output grid using these four elements, maintaining their relative positions (top-left 2x2).
5.  If `C` is even:
    *   Identify the elements at row 0, column `C-2` and row 0, column `C-1`.
    *   Identify the elements at row 1, column `C-2` and row 1, column `C-1`.
    *   Construct the output grid using these four elements, maintaining their relative positions (top-right 2x2).
6.  Format the resulting 2x2 grid as the output, with space-separated numbers on two lines.
