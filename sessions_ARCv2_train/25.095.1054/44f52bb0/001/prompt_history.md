*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input is always a 3x3 grid containing the numbers 0 and 2.
    *   The output is always a single integer, either 1 or 7.
    *   The transformation rule appears to depend on the symmetry of the pattern formed by the number 2 within the grid. Specifically, it relates to vertical symmetry.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task: symmetry_check
    input:
      type: grid
      dimensions: 3x3
      cell_values: [0, 2]
    output:
      type: integer
      values: [1, 7]
    relationship:
      type: vertical_symmetry
      condition: Checks if the first column of the grid is identical to the third column.
      result_map:
        symmetric: 1
        asymmetric: 7
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Examine the input 3x3 grid.
    2.  Compare the elements of the first column with the corresponding elements of the third column.
    3.  If the first column is identical to the third column (i.e., the grid is vertically symmetric), output 1.
    4.  Otherwise (if the first column is different from the third column), output 7.
