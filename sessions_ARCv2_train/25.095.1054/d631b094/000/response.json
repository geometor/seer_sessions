The core operation is extracting specific values from this grid and arranging them into a linear sequence. The defining characteristic of the extracted values is that they are non-zero. The order in the output sequence corresponds to the standard reading order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom) of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
