Input:
  type: grid
  dimensionality: 2
  data_type: integer
  properties:
    - contains zeros and non-zero numbers
    - fixed size (3x3 in examples, might be general)
Output:
  type: sequence
  dimensionality: 1
  data_type: integer
  properties:
    - contains only the non-zero numbers from the input
    - order matches the reading order of non-zero elements in the input grid
Transformation:
  action: extraction
  rule: collect non-zero elements
  order: row-major (top-to-bottom, left-to-right)
Relationships:
  - The output sequence length equals the count of non-zero elements in the input grid.
  - Each element in the output sequence is identical to a non-zero element in the input grid.
  - The position of an element in the output sequence is determined by its position in the input grid relative to other non-zero elements when scanned in reading order.
