**input:**
```
4 4 4 4 4 4

*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input consists of two lines, each containing a sequence of identical numbers separated by spaces.
    *   The output also consists of two lines, each containing a sequence of numbers separated by spaces.
    *   The length of the sequences in the input lines is consistent within an example (e.g., 6 in both examples).
    *   The output lines appear to be generated by interleaving the numbers from the two input lines.
    *   The first output line starts with the number from the first input line and alternates with the number from the second input line.
    *   The second output line starts with the number from the second input line and alternates with the number from the first input line.
    *   The length of the output sequences matches the length of the input sequences.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - input_line_1:
          type: string
          description: A sequence of identical numbers separated by spaces.
          properties:
            - number_value: The repeated number in the sequence.
            - length: The count of numbers in the sequence.
      - input_line_2:
          type: string
          description: A sequence of identical numbers separated by spaces, different from input_line_1.
          properties:
            - number_value: The repeated number in the sequence.
            - length: The count of numbers in the sequence.
      - output_line_1:
          type: string
          description: A sequence of alternating numbers derived from input lines.
      - output_line_2:
          type: string
          description: A sequence of alternating numbers derived from input lines.
    relationships:
      - input_line_1 and input_line_2 have the same length.
      - output_line_1 and output_line_2 are derived from input_line_1 and input_line_2.
      - output_line_1 and output_line_2 have the same length as the input lines.
    actions:
      - parse: Extract the repeated number and length from each input line.
      - interleave: Create output lines by alternating the numbers from the input lines.
      - format: Join the numbers with spaces to form the output strings.
    transformation_pattern:
      - rule: Generate two output lines by alternating the single number from each input line.
      - detail_1: The first output line starts with the number from the first input line.
      - detail_2: The second output line starts with the number from the second input line.
      - detail_3: The alternation continues for the length of the input sequences.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Read the first input line and identify its repeated number (let's call it `num1`) and its length (let's call it `length`).
    2.  Read the second input line and identify its repeated number (let's call it `num2`).
    3.  Initialize two empty lists, `output1_elements` and `output2_elements`.
    4.  Iterate `length` times (using an index `i` from 0 to `length - 1`):
        a.  If the index `i` is even (0, 2, 4, ...):
            i.  Append `num1` to `output1_elements`.
            ii. Append `num2` to `output2_elements`.
        b.  If the index `i` is odd (1, 3, 5, ...):
            i.  Append `num2` to `output1_elements`.
            ii. Append `num1` to `output2_elements`.
    5.  Join the elements in `output1_elements` with spaces to create the first output line string.
    6.  Join the elements in `output2_elements` with spaces to create the second output line string.
    7.  Print the first output line string.
    8.  Print the second output line string.

Generate two output rows by alternating the single number from each input row.
The first output row starts with the number from the first input row.
The second output row starts with the number from the second input row.
The alternation continues for the length of the input rows.

    Transforms the input grid by interleaving the elements of the two rows.
