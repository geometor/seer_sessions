## Perception of Task Elements

The input consists of a 3x3 grid containing only the integers 0 and 2. The output is a single integer, either 1 or 7. The transformation rule appears to depend on the spatial arrangement of the '2's within the grid. Specifically, it seems to test whether any two '2's are directly adjacent horizontally or vertically.

## Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - element: Input Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array (list of lists)
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - cell_values: integers (0 or 2)
  - element: Output Value
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - possible_values: [1, 7]
relationships:
  - relationship: Adjacency Check
    description: The core logic involves checking if any two cells containing the value '2' share a common edge (are horizontally or vertically adjacent). Diagonal adjacency is not considered.
transformation:
  - condition: If any two '2's in the input grid are adjacent (horizontally or vertically).
    action: Output the integer 7.
  - condition: If no two '2's in the input grid are adjacent.
    action: Output the integer 1.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Examine the input 3x3 grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell of the grid.
3.  If a cell contains the value '2', check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).
4.  If any of these neighbors also contain the value '2', then an adjacency exists. Immediately conclude the process and output the value 7.
5.  If the entire grid is scanned and no adjacent '2's are found, output the value 1.
