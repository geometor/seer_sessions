**Perception:**

The task takes a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers as input and produces a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers as output. The output grid is uniform; all cells contain the same digit. This output digit appears to be derived from the input grid based on some property of the digits present. By observing the examples, the digit used to fill the output grid is consistently the digit that appears most frequently in the input grid.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array (3x3)
    properties:
      - cells: contain single-digit integers (0-9)
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array (3x3)
    properties:
      - cells: contain a single, repeated digit derived from the input_grid
  - name: digit
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: 0-9
      - frequency: count of occurrences within the input_grid

actions:
  - name: analyze_frequency
    description: Count the occurrences of each unique digit within the input_grid.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: frequency map (digit -> count)
  - name: find_most_frequent
    description: Identify the digit with the highest frequency count.
    inputs: frequency map
    outputs: most_frequent_digit
  - name: generate_output
    description: Create the output_grid by filling all its cells with the most_frequent_digit.
    inputs: most_frequent_digit, grid_dimensions (3x3)
    outputs: output_grid

relationships:
  - The value filling the output_grid is determined by the frequency analysis of the input_grid.
  - The output_grid's dimensions are identical to the input_grid's dimensions (3x3).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input 3x3 grid of digits.
2.  Iterate through all cells of the input grid and count the frequency of each distinct digit (0 through 9).
3.  Identify the digit that has the highest frequency count. This is the target digit.
4.  Construct a new 3x3 grid.
5.  Fill every cell of the new 3x3 grid with the identified target digit.
6.  Output the newly constructed grid.
