objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array (3x3)
    properties:
      - cells: contain single-digit integers (0-9)
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array (3x3)
    properties:
      - cells: contain a single, repeated digit derived from the input_grid
  - name: digit
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: 0-9
      - frequency: count of occurrences within the input_grid

actions:
  - name: analyze_frequency
    description: Count the occurrences of each unique digit within the input_grid.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: frequency map (digit -> count)
  - name: find_most_frequent
    description: Identify the digit with the highest frequency count.
    inputs: frequency map
    outputs: most_frequent_digit
  - name: generate_output
    description: Create the output_grid by filling all its cells with the most_frequent_digit.
    inputs: most_frequent_digit, grid_dimensions (3x3)
    outputs: output_grid

relationships:
  - The value filling the output_grid is determined by the frequency analysis of the input_grid.
  - The output_grid's dimensions are identical to the input_grid's dimensions (3x3).
