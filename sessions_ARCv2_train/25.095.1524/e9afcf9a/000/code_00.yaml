Input:
  type: text
  structure: two lines
  line_1:
    content: sequence of identical numbers (N1) separated by spaces
    length: L
  line_2:
    content: sequence of identical numbers (N2) separated by spaces
    length: L
Output:
  type: text
  structure: two lines
  line_1:
    content: alternating sequence of N1 and N2, starting with N1, separated by spaces
    length: L
  line_2:
    content: alternating sequence of N2 and N1, starting with N2, separated by spaces
    length: L
Relationships:
  - Output line 1 is generated by interleaving N1 and N2, starting with N1.
  - Output line 2 is generated by interleaving N2 and N1, starting with N2.
  - The length L of the sequences remains constant between input and output.
