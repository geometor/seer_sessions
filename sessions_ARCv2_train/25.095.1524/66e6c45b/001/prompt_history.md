Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Structure:** The input is consistently a 4x4 grid of numbers. A noticeable feature is a central 2x2 block containing non-zero digits, while the surrounding border cells are zeros.
*   **Output Structure:** The output is also a 4x4 grid. The non-zero numbers from the input's central block appear relocated to the four corner positions of the output grid. The remaining cells in the output grid are zeros.
*   **Transformation:** The core operation seems to be extracting the numbers from the 2x2 central block of the input and repositioning them to the corners of the output grid. The relative positions (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) within the central block appear to be preserved when moved to the corners.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation

Input:
  Type: 2D Grid
  Dimensions: 4x4
  Properties:
    - Contains integer values.
    - Features a central 2x2 subgrid (rows 1-2, columns 1-2, 0-indexed) with non-zero values.
    - Border cells (row 0, row 3, column 0, column 3) are typically zero.

Output:
  Type: 2D Grid
  Dimensions: 4x4
  Properties:
    - Contains integer values.
    - Non-zero values are located only at the four corner positions (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3).
    - All other cells are zero.

Relationships:
  - Rule: Map values from the input's central 2x2 subgrid to the output's corner positions.
  - Mapping:
    - Input[1][1] value maps to Output[0][0]
    - Input[1][2] value maps to Output[0][3]
    - Input[2][1] value maps to Output[3][0]
    - Input[2][2] value maps to Output[3][3]
  - Action:
    1. Identify the 2x2 subgrid at Input rows 1-2 and columns 1-2.
    2. Create a new 4x4 grid initialized with zeros.
    3. Copy the identified input values to the corresponding corner positions in the new grid according to the mapping rule.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new 4x4 output grid and fill it entirely with zeros.
2.  Take the value from the input grid at position (row 1, column 1) and place it into the output grid at position (row 0, column 0).
3.  Take the value from the input grid at position (row 1, column 2) and place it into the output grid at position (row 0, column 3).
4.  Take the value from the input grid at position (row 2, column 1) and place it into the output grid at position (row 3, column 0).
5.  Take the value from the input grid at position (row 2, column 2) and place it into the output grid at position (row 3, column 3).
6.  The resulting output grid is the final result.
