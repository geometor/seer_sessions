Specifically, the elements at indices 0 and 1 are swapped, the element at index 2 is kept, the elements at indices 3 and 4 are swapped, and so on.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Increment `i` by 2.\n                If `i` mod 3 is 2, keep the element at `i`. Increment `i` by 1.\n                (Alternative description: Process the list in chunks of three. For each chunk [a, b, c], transform it to [b, a, c]. If the list length isn't a multiple of three, the remaining one or two elements are handled: a remaining pair [a, b] becomes [b, a], and a single remaining element stays as is. This needs checking... Let's re-evaluate the simple iteration.)\n\n    Let's re-verify the simple iteration logic:\n    Input: `[9, 0, 1, 6, 8]` (indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)\n    i = 0: Swap index 0 and 1. List becomes `[0, 9, 1, 6, 8]`. Increment i by 2 (i=2).\n    i = 2: Keep index 2. List remains `[0, 9, 1, 6, 8]`. Increment i by 1 (i=3).\n    i = 3: Swap index 3 and 4. List becomes `[0, 9, 1, 8, 6]`. Increment i by 2 (i=5).\n    i = 5: End of list. Output: `[0, 9, 1, 8, 6]`. Correct.\n\n    Input: `[4, 3, 6, 2, 8]` (indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)\n    i = 0: Swap index 0 and 1. List becomes `[3, 4, 6, 2, 8]`. Increment i by 2 (i=2).\n    i = 2: Keep index 2. List remains `[3, 4, 6, 2, 8]`. Increment i by 1 (i=3).\n    i = 3: Swap index 3 and 4. List becomes `[3, 4, 6, 8, 2]`. Increment i by 2 (i=5).\n    i = 5: End of list. Output: `[3, 4, 6, 8, 2]`. Correct.\n\n    The logic seems to be: iterate with an index `i`. If the element is the *first* in a pair to be swapped (i.e., index 0, 3, 6, ...), swap it with the next element and advance the index by 2. Otherwise (i.e., index 2, 5, 8, ...), keep the element and advance the index by 1.\n\n    Revised YAML Rule:\n    ```"
