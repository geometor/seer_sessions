*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences (lists) of single-digit integers.
    *   The output contains the same integers as the input, but their order is changed.
    *   The length of the output sequence is identical to the length of the input sequence.
    *   The reordering appears to happen in specific blocks or pairs within the sequence. Comparing input and output pairs reveals a pattern: the first two elements swap, the third stays, the next two swap, and so on.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - name: input_list
        type: list
        properties:
          - type: integer_elements
          - property: order
      - name: output_list
        type: list
        properties:
          - type: integer_elements
          - property: order
          - relationship: contains the same elements as input_list

    actions:
      - name: reorder_elements
        input: input_list
        output: output_list
        logic: |
          Processes the list in blocks of three elements.
          Within each block starting at index i (0, 3, 6, ...):
          If elements exist at index i and i+1, their positions are swapped.
          The element at index i+2 (if it exists) remains in its position relative to the block.

    relationships:
      - type: positional_swap
        elements: [input_list[i], input_list[i+1]]
        condition: for i = 0, 3, 6, ... if i+1 < length(input_list)
        result: elements appear as [input_list[i+1], input_list[i]] in the output list at the corresponding positions.
      - type: positional_identity
        elements: [input_list[i+2]]
        condition: for i = 0, 3, 6, ... if i+2 < length(input_list)
        result: element appears as input_list[i+2] in the output list at the corresponding position.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an output list as a copy of the input list.
    2.  Iterate through the indices of the input list starting from index 0, with a step of 3 (i.e., process indices 0, 3, 6, ...).
    3.  For each starting index `i`, check if the next index `i+1` is within the bounds of the list.
    4.  If `i+1` is within bounds, swap the elements at index `i` and `i+1` in the output list.
    5.  The element at index `i+2` (if it exists) is not modified by this swap step and retains its position relative to the start of its block.
    6.  Return the modified output list.
