*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input is consistently a 3x3 grid containing the integers 0 and 2.
    *   The output is always a single integer, either 1 or 7.
    *   The arrangement of the '2's within the grid appears to form a visual pattern.
    *   The output seems related to a property of this pattern formed by the '2's.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - object: input_grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array (list of lists)
          - dimensions: 3x3
          - cell_values: [0, 2]
      - object: output_value
        properties:
          - type: integer
          - possible_values: [1, 7]
      - object: pattern
        properties:
          - formed_by: cells with value 2 in the input_grid
          - potential_property: symmetry (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, point)
    relationships:
      - determines: The pattern in the input_grid determines the output_value.
    actions:
      - identify: Locate the cells with value 2 in the input_grid.
      - analyze: Assess the symmetry of the pattern formed by the '2' cells.
      - assign_output: 
          - If the pattern has symmetry (horizontal, vertical, or potentially others), output 1.
          - If the pattern lacks these symmetries, output 7. 
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Examine the input 3x3 grid.
    2.  Consider the cells containing the value '2' as forming a distinct pattern against a background of '0's.
    3.  Check if this pattern exhibits symmetry across its horizontal axis (i.e., the top row mirrors the bottom row).
    4.  Check if this pattern exhibits symmetry across its vertical axis (i.e., the left column mirrors the right column).
    5.  Check if this pattern exhibits point symmetry (i.e., rotating the grid 180 degrees leaves the pattern unchanged) or symmetry across either main diagonal.
    6.  If the pattern possesses *any* of these forms of symmetry (horizontal, vertical, point, or diagonal), the output is 1.
    7.  If the pattern does not possess *any* of these symmetries, the output is 7.
