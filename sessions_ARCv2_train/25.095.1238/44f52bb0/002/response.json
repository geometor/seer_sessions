            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" across all examples strongly suggests that the input `input_grid` being passed to the `transform` function by the testing environment is a NumPy array, not a standard Python list of lists as initially assumed by the type hints and some comparison logic (e.g., `grid == rotated_grid`). Standard Python list comparison (`list1 == list2`) returns a single boolean, while NumPy array comparison (`array1 == array2`) returns a boolean array, which cannot be directly evaluated in an `if` condition.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Assume the `input_grid` is a NumPy array.\n2.  Modify the helper functions to use NumPy-specific functions for comparisons and operations (e.g., `np.array_equal`, `np.rot90`, `.T` for transpose).\n3.  Verify that the underlying logic (checking for various symmetries and returning 1 if any are found, 7 otherwise) still holds for all examples with the corrected NumPy implementation.\n\n**Metrics and Verification**\n\nLet's re-evaluate the symmetry conditions assuming `input_grid` is a NumPy array and using appropriate NumPy functions.\n\n*   **Example 1:** `[[0,0,0],[2,0,2],[0,0,0]]`\n    *   Horizontal Symmetry (`np.array_equal(grid[0,:], grid[2,:])`): True. Expected Output: 1. Matches.\n*   **Example 2:** `[[2,2,0],[0,2,2],[0,0,0]]`\n    *   Horizontal: False\n    *   Vertical (`np.array_equal(grid[:,0], grid[:,2])`): False\n    *   Point (`np.array_equal(grid, np.rot90(grid, 2))`): False\n    *   Main Diagonal (`np.array_equal(grid, grid.T)`): False\n    *   Anti-Diagonal (`np.array_equal(grid, np.fliplr(np.flipud(grid.T)))`): False. Expected Output: 7. Matches.\n*   **Example 3:** `[[2,2,0],[0,2,0],[0,0,0]]`\n    *   Horizontal: False\n    *   Vertical: False\n    *   Point: False\n    *   Main Diagonal: False\n    *   Anti-Diagonal: False. Expected Output: 7. Matches.\n*   **Example 4:** `[[2,0,0],[2,0,0],[0,2,0]]`\n    *   Horizontal: False\n    *   Vertical: False\n    *   Point: False\n    *   Main Diagonal: False\n    *   Anti-Diagonal: False (`grid[0,0](2) != grid[2,2](0)`). Expected Output: 7. Matches.\n*   **Example 5:** `[[2,0,2],[2,0,2],[2,0,2]]`\n    *   Horizontal: True. Expected Output: 1. Matches. (Also has Vertical symmetry).\n*   **Example 6:** `[[2,0,2],[0,2,0],[2,0,2]]`\n    *   Horizontal: True. Expected Output: 1. Matches. (Also has Vertical, Point, Main Diagonal, Anti-Diagonal symmetry).\n\nThe analysis confirms that the symmetry detection logic remains valid. The errors were purely due to the implementation details concerning the input data type (NumPy array vs. list of lists) and how comparisons were performed.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
