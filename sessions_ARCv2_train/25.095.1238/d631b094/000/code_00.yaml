Input:
  type: grid
  dimensions: 3x3
  elements:
    - type: cell
      properties:
        - value: digit (0-9)
        - position: (row, column)
  objects:
    - background: cells with value 0
    - significant_elements: cells with non-zero values

Output:
  type: sequence
  elements:
    - type: digit
      properties:
        - value: derived from non-zero input cells

Transformation:
  action: scan_and_collect
  parameters:
    - source: input grid
    - target: output sequence
    - condition: cell value is not 0
    - order: row-major (top-to-bottom, left-to-right)
  relationship: The output sequence contains exactly the non-zero digits from the input grid, preserving the order they appear in a row-major scan.
