## Perception

The input consists of a 3x3 grid of single digits. The digit '0' appears to act as a background or empty value. The other digits (1 through 9) represent significant elements within the grid.

The output is a sequence of digits. These digits correspond exactly to the non-zero digits present in the input grid.

The transformation rule seems to involve scanning the input grid and extracting all non-zero digits. The order of the digits in the output sequence matches the order they are encountered when scanning the input grid row by row, from left to right within each row.

## Facts


```yaml
Input:
  type: grid
  dimensions: 3x3
  elements:
    - type: cell
      properties:
        - value: digit (0-9)
        - position: (row, column)
  objects:
    - background: cells with value 0
    - significant_elements: cells with non-zero values

Output:
  type: sequence
  elements:
    - type: digit
      properties:
        - value: derived from non-zero input cells

Transformation:
  action: scan_and_collect
  parameters:
    - source: input grid
    - target: output sequence
    - condition: cell value is not 0
    - order: row-major (top-to-bottom, left-to-right)
  relationship: The output sequence contains exactly the non-zero digits from the input grid, preserving the order they appear in a row-major scan.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty sequence for the output.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, starting from the top row (row 0) and proceeding downwards.
3.  Within each row, iterate through each cell, starting from the leftmost column (column 0) and proceeding to the right.
4.  For each cell, check its digit value.
5.  If the digit value is not zero, append this digit to the end of the output sequence.
6.  After iterating through all cells in the grid, the resulting sequence is the final output.
