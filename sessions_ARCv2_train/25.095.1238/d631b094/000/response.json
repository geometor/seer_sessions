The other digits (1 through 9) represent significant elements within the grid.\n\nThe output is a sequence of digits. These digits correspond exactly to the non-zero digits present in the input grid.\n\nThe transformation rule seems to involve scanning the input grid and extracting all non-zero digits. The order of the digits in the output sequence matches the order they are encountered when scanning the input grid row by row, from left to right within each row.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
