  InputStructure:
    - type: list
      name: input_lines
      count: 2
      elements:
        - type: string
          name: line_1
          content: sequence of identical numbers separated by spaces
        - type: string
          name: line_2
          content: sequence of identical numbers separated by spaces
  InputProperties:
    - property: sequence_length
      value: identical for both input lines (e.g., 6 in the examples)
    - property: number_1
      description: the unique number repeated in line_1
    - property: number_2
      description: the unique number repeated in line_2
      constraint: number_1 is different from number_2

        - target: output_line_1
          pattern: Start with number_1, alternate with number_2 for the original sequence length.
        - target: output_line_2
          pattern: Start with number_2, alternate with number_1 for the original sequence length.
