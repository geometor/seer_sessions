These lines are formed by interleaving `num1` and `num2`.\n- The first output line starts with `num1` and alternates with `num2`.\n- The second output line starts with `num2` and alternates with `num1`.\n- The length of the output sequences is the same as the length of the input sequences.\n\n## Factual Analysis\n\n"
