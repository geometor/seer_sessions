task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  - type: 2D array of integers # Potentially NumPy array based on execution errors
  - size: constant (3x3 in examples)
  - cell_values: integers (0-9 observed)
objects:
  - name: grid_cell
    properties:
      - value: integer
      - row_index: integer
      - column_index: integer
      - is_zero: boolean
  - name: grid_column
    properties:
      - index: integer
      - cells: ordered list of grid_cells (from top to bottom)
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Cells are arranged in rows and columns.
  - type: vertical_dependency
    description: The value of a zero cell can be determined by the value of the nearest non-zero cell above it in the same column.
actions:
  - name: propagate_value_downward
    actor: non_zero_cell_value
    target: zero_cell_value
    condition: The zero cell is located below the non-zero cell within the same column, and no other non-zero cell exists between them in that column.
    effect: The zero cell's value in the output grid is replaced by the value of the nearest non-zero cell found above it in the input grid's column.
transformation_focus: column-based processing
state_tracking:
  - name: last_non_zero_value_in_column
    scope: per_column
    update_rule: Updated whenever a non-zero value is encountered while scanning down a column.
    initial_value: 0 (or conceptually 'none')
goal: Create an output grid where vertical gaps (zeros) below non-zero numbers within each column are filled with the most recent non-zero value encountered above them in that column.
