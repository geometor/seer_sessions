**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers into another 3x3 grid. The input grid contains various digits, while the output grid consists of a single digit repeated across all cells. The core operation appears to be an analysis of the frequency of digits within the input grid to determine the single digit used to populate the output grid.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation
Input:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: 3x3
    - Content: Single-digit integers (0-9)
    - Name: input_grid
Output:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: 3x3
    - Content: Single-digit integers (0-9)
    - Constraint: All cells contain the same digit.
    - Name: output_grid
Relationship:
  - Action: Analyze frequency of digits in input_grid
  - Action: Identify the most frequent digit (mode) in input_grid
  - Action: Create output_grid
  - Action: Fill all cells of output_grid with the identified mode digit
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input 3x3 grid of digits.
2.  Count the occurrences of each distinct digit within the input grid.
3.  Identify the digit that occurs most frequently (the mode).
4.  Construct a new 3x3 grid.
5.  Fill every cell of the new grid with the mode digit identified in step 3.
6.  Output the resulting grid.
