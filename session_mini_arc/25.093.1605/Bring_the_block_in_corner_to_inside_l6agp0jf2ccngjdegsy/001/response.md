```python
"""
Transforms the input grid by moving specific non-zero digits ('movers')
diagonally towards the largest contiguous block of identical non-zero digits
('target block').

1. Identifies the largest contiguous block of a single non-zero digit using
   orthogonal adjacency (up, down, left, right).
2. Identifies all other non-zero digits ('movers') that are not part of this
   target block.
3. For each mover:
    a. Determines the diagonal direction towards the target block based on
       its position relative to the block's bounding box. (e.g., if mover is
       top-left of the block's bounding box, direction is down-right).
    b. Traces this diagonal path one step at a time from the mover's starting
       position.
    c. Finds the first cell along this path whose coordinates belong to the
       set of coordinates identified for the target block.
    d. Replaces the value of the hit target block cell in the output grid
       with the mover's value.
    e. Sets the original position of the mover in the output grid to 0.
4. Returns the modified grid. All cells not affected by the movers (original
   zeros and remaining target block cells) retain their original values.
