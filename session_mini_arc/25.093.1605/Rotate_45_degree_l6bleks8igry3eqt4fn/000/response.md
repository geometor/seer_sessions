Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** Both input and output are 2D grids of numerical digits, specifically 5x5 grids in all examples.
2.  **Transformation Scope:** The transformation modifies only a subset of the cells on the border of the grid. The inner 3x3 block of cells remains unchanged.
3.  **Key Locations:** The transformation specifically targets two types of border cells:
    *   **Corners:** The four cells at the extremities (0,0), (0,4), (4,0), (4,4).
    *   **Midpoints:** The four cells at the center of each edge (0,2), (2,0), (2,4), (4,2).
4.  **Unaffected Border Cells:** The border cells adjacent to the corners and midpoints (e.g., (0,1), (1,0), (0,3), (1,4), etc.) appear unchanged in all examples. Let's call the value in these cells in the input `V`.
5.  **Conditional Logic:** The way the corners and midpoints are modified depends crucially on the value of the corner cells in the *input* grid.
    *   **Case 1 (Input Corners are 0):** If the input corner cells have a value of 0 (as in train_1 and train_3), both the corner cells and the midpoint cells in the output grid take the value `V` (the value of the adjacent, unaffected border cells).
    *   **Case 2 (Input Corners are non-zero):** If the input corner cells have a non-zero value (as in train_2), the output corner cells are set to 0. The output midpoint cells take the value of their respective immediate inner neighbor towards the center of the grid.
6.  **Inner Neighbors:** For Case 2, the relevant inner neighbors for the midpoints are:
    *   (0,2)'s inner neighbor is (1,2)
    *   (2,0)'s inner neighbor is (2,1)
    *   (2,4)'s inner neighbor is (2,3)
    *   (4,2)'s inner neighbor is (3,2)

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 2D Array of Integers
  Size: 5x5 (constant in examples)
Cells:
  Categories:
    - Corner:
        Locations: [[0,0], [0,4], [4,0], [4,4]]
    - Midpoint: # Midpoint of each edge
        Locations: [[0,2], [2,0], [2,4], [4,2]]
    - AdjacentBorder: # Border cells neither corner nor midpoint
        Locations: [[0,1], [0,3], [1,0], [1,4], [3,0], [3,4], [4,1], [4,3]]
    - Inner: # Cells not on the border
        Locations: [[1,1]..[3,3]] excluding midpoints (2,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,2) - actually all cells from (1,1) to (3,3)
  Properties:
    - Value: Integer digit
    - Location: [Row, Column]
Relationships:
  - InnerNeighborOfMidpoint:
      - Midpoint [0,2] -> Inner Cell [1,2]
      - Midpoint [2,0] -> Inner Cell [2,1]
      - Midpoint [2,4] -> Inner Cell [2,3]
      - Midpoint [4,2] -> Inner Cell [3,2]
Transformation:
  Type: Conditional Cell Modification
  Scope: Affects only Corner and Midpoint cells.
  Condition: Based on the value of Input Corner cells.
  Rule_Case1: # Input Corner Value == 0
    Output Corner Value: Value of Input AdjacentBorder cells
    Output Midpoint Value: Value of Input AdjacentBorder cells
  Rule_Case2: # Input Corner Value != 0
    Output Corner Value: 0
    Output Midpoint Value: Value of the respective InnerNeighborOfMidpoint cell in the Input grid.
  Unchanged: Inner cells and AdjacentBorder cells retain their Input values.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input 5x5 grid.
2.  Identify the value of the input corner cells (e.g., at location [0,0]). Let this be `InputCornerValue`.
3.  If `InputCornerValue` is 0:
    a.  Identify the value of the adjacent border cells (e.g., at location [0,1] or [1,0]). Let this be `AdjacentValue`.
    b.  Set the value of all four corner cells in the output grid to `AdjacentValue`.
    c.  Set the value of all four midpoint edge cells ([0,2], [2,0], [2,4], [4,2]) in the output grid to `AdjacentValue`.
4.  If `InputCornerValue` is not 0:
    a.  Set the value of all four corner cells in the output grid to 0.
    b.  For each midpoint edge cell ([0,2], [2,0], [2,4], [4,2]):
        i.  Find the value of its immediate inner neighbor cell in the input grid (at [1,2], [2,1], [2,3], [3,2] respectively).
        ii. Set the value of the corresponding midpoint edge cell in the output grid to this inner neighbor's value.
5.  Keep all other cells (inner cells and adjacent border cells) unchanged from their input values.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
