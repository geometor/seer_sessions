The examples shown are 5x5 grids.\n2.  **Transformation Scope:** The transformation primarily affects the first row of the grid. All other rows (from the second row downwards) appear to be copied directly from the input to the output without modification.\n3.  **First Row Modification:** The first row of the output grid is uniformly filled with a single digit.\n4.  **Determining the Fill Value:** The digit used to fill the first row of the output is determined by scanning the *input* grid. The scanning process proceeds column by column, from left to right. Within each column, it scans row by row, from top to bottom. The first non-zero digit encountered during this scan is the value used to fill the entire first row of the output.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

For the current column, iterate through its rows, starting from the top row (index 0) and moving downwards.\n6.  Check the value of the cell at the current row and column.\n7.

If the scanning completes without finding a non-zero value, the `fill_value` remains at its initial state (likely zero, though examples don't cover this case explicitly; assuming the task guarantees at least one non-zero value if modification occurs, or perhaps the first row remains unchanged if all input values are zero). Based on the examples, it seems a non-zero value is always found.\n9.  Iterate through all the cells in the first row (index 0) of the output grid.\n10. Set the value of each cell in the first row of the output grid to the determined `fill_value`.\n11. Return the modified output grid."
