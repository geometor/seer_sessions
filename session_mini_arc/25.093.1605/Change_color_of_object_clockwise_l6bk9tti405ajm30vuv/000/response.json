Zero ('0') appears to function as a background color or empty space. Non-zero integers represent different categories or 'colors'.\n*   **Transformation Type:** The transformation modifies the values (colors) of the non-zero cells while preserving the positions of zero and non-zero cells. The set of unique non-zero values present in the input is the same as the set of unique non-zero values in the output.\n*   **Core Logic:** The transformation seems to depend on the frequency (count) of each unique non-zero value in the input grid. It looks like a re-mapping or permutation of the non-zero values based on their frequency ranking.\n\n## YAML Facts:\n\n"

Sort this list primarily based on frequency in descending order (most frequent first). If two values have the same frequency, sort them secondarily by their numerical value in ascending order (smaller number first).\n3.  **Rank Target Values:** Create a second ordered list of the same unique non-zero values (`RankedTargetValues`). Sort this list primarily based on frequency in ascending order (least frequent first). If two values have the same frequency, sort them secondarily by their numerical value in descending order (larger number first).\n4.  **Create Mapping:** Build a mapping rule where the value at index `i` in `RankedInputValues` maps to the value at index `i` in `RankedTargetValues`.\n5.  **Transform Grid:** Construct the output grid by examining each cell of the input grid. If a cell contains 0, place 0 in the corresponding cell of the output grid. If a cell contains a non-zero value `V`, find the value that `V` maps to using the mapping rule created in step 4, and place that mapped value in the corresponding cell of the output grid."
