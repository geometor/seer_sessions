The primary elements are the grid itself, the numbers within the grid (specifically distinguishing between zero and non-zero values), and the columns of the grid. The transformation appears to simulate a form of \"gravity\" acting independently on each column. Non-zero numbers within a column fall downwards, maintaining their relative vertical order, until they stack up at the bottom of the column or on top of another non-zero number. The cells left empty by this movement are filled with zeros.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
