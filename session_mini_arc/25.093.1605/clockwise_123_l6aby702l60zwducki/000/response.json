            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\nThe task involves transforming a 2D grid of integers (colors) based on specific rules.\n1.  **Grid:** A rectangular array of cells, each containing an integer.\n2.  **Colors:** The integers represent colors. Color 0 is typically the background. Non-zero integers represent foreground objects or filled areas.\n3.  **Input State:** The initial configuration of colors in the grid. Contains existing shapes or patterns.\n4.  **Output State:** The modified configuration after applying the transformation rule. Some background cells (0) are changed to a specific foreground color. Existing foreground colors remain unchanged.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The core process involves identifying a \"source color\" and one or more \"trigger points\" based on the input configuration. These triggers initiate a filling process (like dropping paint) which potentially involves vertical falling and horizontal spreading, using the source color. There appear to be two distinct scenarios for triggering the fill.\n\n## YAML Fact Sheet\n\n"

Identify the vertical Falling Path starting below the trigger.\n        2. Identify the horizontal Spreading Path starting leftwards from the bottom of the Falling Path.\n        3. Fill all cells in the Falling Path and Spreading Path with fill_color.\n\nPriority: Rule 2 (Isolated Trigger) takes precedence. If an Isolated Trigger exists, Rule 1 is not applied.

Find the highest row index, `r_top`, that contains at least one non-zero value. If no non-zero values exist anywhere, stop.\n    b. Find the column index, `c_left`, of the leftmost non-zero value in row `r_top`. Set the `fill_color` to the value at `(r_top, c_left)`.\n    c. Find the column index, `c_right`, of the rightmost non-zero value in row `r_top`.\n3.  **Check for Isolated Trigger:**\n    a. Search all rows `r` from `r_top + 1` down to the bottom row of the grid.\n    b. For each row `r`, check if it contains exactly one non-zero value.\n    c. Collect all such \"isolated trigger\" cells `(r, c)`.\n    d. If one or more isolated triggers were found:\n        i. Select the trigger `(r_trigger, c_trigger)` that has the maximum `r` value. If there's a tie for maximum `r`, select the one among them with the maximum `c` value.\n        ii. **Perform Fall & Spread (Rule 2):**\n            A. Starting from the cell directly below the trigger, `(r_trigger + 1, c_trigger)`, trace downwards column `c_trigger`. Identify the contiguous sequence of cells containing 0. Let the last cell in this sequence be `(y_stop, c_trigger)`. This is the Falling Path.\n            B. Starting from the cell to the left of the end of the fall, `(y_stop, c_trigger - 1)`, trace leftwards along row `y_stop`. Identify the contiguous sequence of cells containing 0. Let the last cell in this sequence be `(y_stop, x_stop)`. This is the Spreading Path.\n            C. Change the value of all cells in the Falling Path and the Spreading Path to `fill_color` in the output grid.\n        iii. Proceed to step 5 (Finalize).\n4.  **Perform Top Row Extension & Drip (Rule 1):** (This step only runs if NO isolated trigger was found in step 3)\n    a. Initialize a flag `filled_top_row = false`.\n    b. Iterate through columns `c` from `c_right + 1` to the last column index.\n    c. If the cell `(r_top, c)` in the output grid contains 0:\n        i. Change the value of `(r_top, c)` to `fill_color`.\n        ii. Set `filled_top_row = true`.\n        iii. Keep track of the rightmost column filled in this step, `c_new_right = c`.\n    d. If `filled_top_row` is true:\n        i. Check the cell below the rightmost filled cell: `(r_top + 1, c_new_right)`.\n        ii. If this cell is within grid boundaries and contains 0, change its value to `fill_color` in the output grid.\n5.  **Finalize:** The transformation is complete. The output grid holds the final state."
