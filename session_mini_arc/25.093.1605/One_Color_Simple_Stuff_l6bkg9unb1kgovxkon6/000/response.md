**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task operates on square grids composed of binary digits (0s and 1s). The core transformation involves shifting the content of the input grid upwards by one row. The first (top) row of the input grid is discarded in this shift. The key variation lies in how the last (bottom) row of the output grid is generated. This generation depends conditionally on the content of the *first* row of the *input* grid. If the input's first row contains any '1's, the output's last row becomes all '0's. However, if the input's first row consists entirely of '0's, the output's last row is created by taking the *last* row of the *input* grid and performing a circular left shift on its elements.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Objects:
  - InputGrid: A 2D array of integers (0 or 1).
  - OutputGrid: A 2D array of integers (0 or 1), same dimensions as InputGrid.
  - GridRow: A 1D array of integers (0 or 1) representing a row within a grid.
  - GridCell: An individual element within the grid, holding a value of 0 or 1.

Properties:
  - Grid:
      - dimensions: {rows: N, columns: M} (In examples, N=M=5)
      - rows: An ordered list of GridRow objects.
  - GridRow:
      - elements: An ordered list of GridCell values.
      - length: Number of elements (equal to grid columns M).
      - contains_one: Boolean property indicating if any element is 1.
      - is_all_zeros: Boolean property indicating if all elements are 0.
  - GridCell:
      - value: Integer (0 or 1).

Actions:
  - ShiftUp: Move rows 1 to N-1 of the InputGrid to rows 0 to N-2 of the OutputGrid.
  - DiscardRow: Row 0 of the InputGrid is not directly copied to the OutputGrid.
  - CheckRowContent: Determine if a specific GridRow (InputGrid row 0) contains any '1's.
  - SetRowToZeros: Populate a specific GridRow (OutputGrid row N-1) with all '0's.
  - CircularLeftShift: Transform a GridRow by moving each element one position to the left, with the first element wrapping around to the last position.
  - AssignRow: Place a generated or transformed GridRow into a specific row index of the OutputGrid.

Relationships:
  - OutputGrid dimensions are identical to InputGrid dimensions.
  - OutputGrid rows 0 through N-2 are directly copied from InputGrid rows 1 through N-1.
  - OutputGrid row N-1 is conditionally generated based on InputGrid row 0 and InputGrid row N-1.
    - If InputGrid row 0 contains a '1', OutputGrid row N-1 is all zeros.
    - If InputGrid row 0 is all zeros, OutputGrid row N-1 is the result of applying CircularLeftShift to InputGrid row N-1.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the Output Grid with the same dimensions as the Input Grid.
2.  Copy rows 1 through N-1 (where N is the total number of rows) from the Input Grid to rows 0 through N-2 of the Output Grid.
3.  Examine row 0 of the Input Grid.
4.  **If** row 0 of the Input Grid contains at least one cell with the value '1':
    a.  Set row N-1 (the last row) of the Output Grid to contain all '0's.
5.  **Else** (if row 0 of the Input Grid contains only '0's):
    a.  Take row N-1 (the last row) of the Input Grid.
    b.  Perform a circular left shift on the elements of this row (the first element becomes the last, and all other elements shift one position left).
    c.  Assign the resulting shifted row as row N-1 of the Output Grid.
6.  Return the completed Output Grid.
