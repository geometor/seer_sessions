# YAML representation of facts observed in the task examples

task_type: grid_transformation

grid_properties:
  - type: 2D array of numbers
  - dimensions: constant (5x5 in examples)
  - element_type: integer digits

transformation_elements:
  - scope: column-based rearrangement
  - invariant: the central column (index = N//2, where N is the number of columns)
  - action: swap column blocks
    - source_block_1: columns from index 0 to N//2 - 1
    - source_block_2: columns from index N//2 + 1 to N - 1
    - target_block_1: columns from index N//2 + 1 to N - 1 (receives source_block_1)
    - target_block_2: columns from index 0 to N//2 - 1 (receives source_block_2)

example_specifics:
  - grid_size: 5x5 (N=5)
  - invariant_column_index: 2 (5 // 2)
  - source_block_1_indices: [0, 1]
  - source_block_2_indices: [3, 4]
  - target_block_1_indices: [3, 4]
  - target_block_2_indices: [0, 1]
