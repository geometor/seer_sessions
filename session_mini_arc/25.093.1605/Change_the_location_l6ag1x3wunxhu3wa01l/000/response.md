Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception of the elements:**

*   **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) of numerical digits.
*   **Grid Size:** All provided examples use 5x5 grids. The transformation preserves the grid dimensions.
*   **Content:** The grids contain digits (0-9). The transformation rearranges the existing digits; no new digits are introduced, and none are removed (though their counts might change if the swapped columns have different numbers of specific digits).
*   **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation appears to be a rearrangement of columns. Observing the examples, the middle column (index 2) remains in its original position. The first two columns (indices 0, 1) seem to move to the last two positions (indices 3, 4), and the last two columns (indices 3, 4) move to the first two positions (indices 0, 1).

**Facts:**


```yaml
# YAML representation of facts observed in the task examples

task_type: grid_transformation

grid_properties:
  - type: 2D array of numbers
  - dimensions: constant (5x5 in examples)
  - element_type: integer digits

transformation_elements:
  - scope: column-based rearrangement
  - invariant: the central column (index = N//2, where N is the number of columns)
  - action: swap column blocks
    - source_block_1: columns from index 0 to N//2 - 1
    - source_block_2: columns from index N//2 + 1 to N - 1
    - target_block_1: columns from index N//2 + 1 to N - 1 (receives source_block_1)
    - target_block_2: columns from index 0 to N//2 - 1 (receives source_block_2)

example_specifics:
  - grid_size: 5x5 (N=5)
  - invariant_column_index: 2 (5 // 2)
  - source_block_1_indices: [0, 1]
  - source_block_2_indices: [3, 4]
  - target_block_1_indices: [3, 4]
  - target_block_2_indices: [0, 1]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Determine the number of columns, N (which is 5 in the examples).
3.  Create a new, empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
4.  Copy the columns from index `N//2 + 1` to `N-1` (columns 3 and 4) of the input grid to the columns from index `0` to `N//2 - 1` (columns 0 and 1) of the output grid, maintaining their internal order.
5.  Copy the column at index `N//2` (column 2) from the input grid directly to the column at index `N//2` (column 2) of the output grid.
6.  Copy the columns from index `0` to `N//2 - 1` (columns 0 and 1) of the input grid to the columns from index `N//2 + 1` to `N-1` (columns 3 and 4) of the output grid, maintaining their internal order.
7.  Return the completed output grid.
