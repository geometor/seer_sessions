**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 2D grid of numbers.
*   **Objects:** The primary object is the grid itself, composed of individual cells containing numerical values. Within the grid, there are contiguous blocks or shapes formed by non-zero numbers, distinct from the background '0' value.
*   **Properties:** Grids have dimensions (height and width). Cells have values (colors/numbers) and positions (row, column). The non-zero shapes have specific configurations and locations within the grid.
*   **Relationships:** Cells are neighbours. Non-zero cells form shapes against a background of zero cells.
*   **Action:** The core action appears to be a spatial rearrangement of the non-zero elements within the grid. Specifically, the patterns suggest a reflection or mirroring.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
components:
  - input_grid:
      type: 2D_array
      element_type: integer
      properties:
        - height: 5
        - width: 5
        - background_value: 0
        - contains_foreground_shapes: true
  - output_grid:
      type: 2D_array
      element_type: integer
      properties:
        - height: 5
        - width: 5
        - background_value: 0
        - contains_foreground_shapes: true
transformation:
  type: spatial_rearrangement
  details: horizontal_flip
  preserves:
    - grid_dimensions
    - element_values (colors)
  modifies:
    - position_of_non_zero_elements
relationship:
  output_grid: is the result of applying a horizontal flip transformation to the input_grid. Each element at position (row, col) in the input grid moves to position (row, width - 1 - col) in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid using its row index `r` and column index `c`.
4.  For each cell value at `input[r][c]`, place this value into the output grid at the mirrored column position: `output[r][width - 1 - c]`, where `width` is the number of columns in the grid.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
