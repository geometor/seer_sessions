The core elements are:\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** A 2D array of integers.\n2.  **Output Grid:** A 2D array of integers derived from the input grid.\n3.  **Cells:** Individual positions within the grid containing integer values.\n4.  **Numbers:** The integer values within the cells. These can be zero or non-zero.\n5.  **Frequency:** The count of occurrences of each distinct non-zero number within the input grid.\n6.  **Most Frequent Non-Zero Number:** The non-zero integer that appears most often in the input grid.\n7.  **Transformation Rule:** A procedure that modifies the input grid to produce the output grid. In this task, the rule involves identifying the most frequent non-zero number and using it to replace all other non-zero numbers.\n\n## Documented Facts\n\n"
