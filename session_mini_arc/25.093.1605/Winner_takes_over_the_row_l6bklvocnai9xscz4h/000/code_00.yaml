Task: Grid Transformation by Row Analysis

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Contains single-digit integers (0-9).
    - Has Rows and Columns.

Output:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Same dimensions (Rows, Columns) as Input.
    - Contains single-digit integers (0-9).
    - Each Row consists of a single, repeated integer.

Transformation:
  Scope: Row-wise (Each input row maps to one output row).
  Action: Frequency Analysis
    - For each Input Row:
      - Identify all unique numbers present.
      - Count the occurrences of each unique number.
      - Determine the number with the highest frequency count (the mode).
  Action: Row Construction
    - For each Output Row:
      - Fill all cells with the most frequent number identified from the corresponding Input Row.

Relationships:
  - Output Row[i] is derived solely from Input Row[i].
  - The value filling Output Row[i] is the statistical mode of Input Row[i].
