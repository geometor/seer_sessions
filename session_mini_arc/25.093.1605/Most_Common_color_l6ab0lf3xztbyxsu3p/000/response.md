**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a 2D grid of single-digit integers into another 2D grid of the same dimensions. The output grid is uniformly filled with a single digit. Analyzing the relationship between the input and output grids across the examples reveals that the digit used to fill the output grid corresponds to the digit that appears most frequently (the mode) in the input grid.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation
Input:
  Type: 2D Grid (Matrix)
  Element Type: Single-digit integer (0-9)
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: Variable, but consistent between input and output for a given example (e.g., 5x5 in the provided examples).
Output:
  Type: 2D Grid (Matrix)
  Element Type: Single-digit integer (0-9)
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: Same as the input grid.
    - Content: Uniformly filled with a single digit.
Transformation:
  Action: Identify the most frequent digit (mode) in the input grid.
  Result: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filling all cells with the identified most frequent digit.
Relationship:
  - The output grid's dimensions are identical to the input grid's dimensions.
  - The value filling the output grid is determined by the statistical mode of the values in the input grid.
Assumptions:
  - There will be a unique most frequent digit in the input grid (no ties are shown in the examples). If ties occur, a tie-breaking rule would be needed (e.g., select the smallest digit among the modes).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid of digits.
2.  Calculate the frequency of each distinct digit present in the input grid.
3.  Determine the digit that has the highest frequency (the mode).
4.  Create a new grid with the same number of rows and columns as the input grid.
5.  Fill every cell of this new grid with the most frequent digit identified in step 3.
6.  Output the newly created grid.
