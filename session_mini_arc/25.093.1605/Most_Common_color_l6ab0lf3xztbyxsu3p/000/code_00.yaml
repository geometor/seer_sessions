Task: Grid Transformation
Input:
  Type: 2D Grid (Matrix)
  Element Type: Single-digit integer (0-9)
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: Variable, but consistent between input and output for a given example (e.g., 5x5 in the provided examples).
Output:
  Type: 2D Grid (Matrix)
  Element Type: Single-digit integer (0-9)
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: Same as the input grid.
    - Content: Uniformly filled with a single digit.
Transformation:
  Action: Identify the most frequent digit (mode) in the input grid.
  Result: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filling all cells with the identified most frequent digit.
Relationship:
  - The output grid's dimensions are identical to the input grid's dimensions.
  - The value filling the output grid is determined by the statistical mode of the values in the input grid.
Assumptions:
  - There will be a unique most frequent digit in the input grid (no ties are shown in the examples). If ties occur, a tie-breaking rule would be needed (e.g., select the smallest digit among the modes).
