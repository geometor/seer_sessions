            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: finding a column composed entirely of '5's and changing its values. However, the precise rule for placing the final '2' was incorrect, specifically failing on `train_2`. The previous code assumed the '2' was placed in the last row of the column reflected across the vertical center (`k = 4 - j`).\n\nThe failure in `train_2` revealed a special case or a different rule. The input column `j` with all '5's was index 2 (the middle column). In this specific case, the '2' appeared at `(4, 4)`, whereas the reflection rule `k = 4 - 2 = 2` predicted it should be at `(4, 2)`. In all other examples (where `j` was 0 or 1), the reflection rule `k = 4 - j` correctly predicted the column for the '2'.\n\nThis suggests a conditional rule for placing the '2':\n1.  Identify the column `j` composed entirely of '5's.\n2.  Transform column `j` by changing all '5's to '1's.\n3.  Determine the target column `k` for the '2':\n    *   If `j` is the middle column (index 2), then `k` is the last column (index 4).\n    *   Otherwise (if `j` is not index 2), `k` is the reflection of `j` across the center, i.e., `k = 4 - j`.\n4.  Place the '2' at the last row (index 4) and the determined column `k`.\n\nThe strategy is to update the documentation (YAML facts) and the natural language program to reflect this refined, conditional rule for placing the '2'.\n\n**Metrics**\n\n*   **train_1:** Passed. Input all-5s column `j=0`. Output '2' at `(4, 4)`. Rule: `j!=2`, `k=4-0=4`. Correct.\n*   **train_2:** Failed. Input all-5s column `j=2`. Expected '2' at `(4, 4)`. Previous code placed '2' at `(4, 2)`. Rule: `j==2`, `k=4`. Correct. Mismatch pixels: 2 (`(4,2)` expected 1 got 2, `(4,4)` expected 2 got 5).\n*   **train_3:** Passed. Input all-5s column `j=0`. Output '2' at `(4, 4)`. Rule: `j!=2`, `k=4-0=4`. Correct.\n*   **train_4:** Passed. Input all-5s column `j=1`. Output '2' at `(4, 3)`. Rule: `j!=2`, `k=4-1=3`. Correct.\n*   **test_1:** Passed (Based on previous code execution results which happened to align with the correct rule for this case). Input all-5s column `j=3`. Output '2' at `(4, 1)`. Rule: `j!=2`, `k=4-3=1`. Correct.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
