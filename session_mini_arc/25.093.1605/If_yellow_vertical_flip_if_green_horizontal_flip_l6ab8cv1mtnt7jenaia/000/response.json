The overall shape or collection of non-zero pixels is preserved but transformed.\n4.  **Transformation Type:** The transformation appears to be a reflection (mirroring) of the input grid's contents.\n5.  **Reflection Axis:** The axis of reflection seems dependent on the specific non-zero digit present:\n    *   When the grid contains '4's (train\\_1, train\\_3), the reflection is *horizontal* (across the vertical centerline).\n    *   When the grid contains '3's (train\\_2, train\\_4), the reflection is *vertical* (across the horizontal centerline).\n6.  **Consistency:** In all examples, only one type of non-zero digit is present in any given input grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
