Grid:
  Properties:
    - type: 2D array
    - dimensions: 5x5 (constant)
    - content: Cells
Cells:
  Properties:
    - value: integer (0, 3, or 4 observed)
    - position: (row, column)
Objects:
  - type: Pattern/Shape
  - formed_by: non-zero Cells
  - properties:
      - digit_value: the specific non-zero digit (e.g., 3 or 4)
Transformation:
  type: Reflection
  axis_determination:
    - rule: Based on the digit_value of the Objects in the input Grid
    - condition_1:
        - if: digit_value is 4
        - then: reflection_axis is vertical_centerline
        - result: Horizontal reflection
    - condition_2:
        - if: digit_value is 3
        - then: reflection_axis is horizontal_centerline
        - result: Vertical reflection
  input: Input Grid
  output: Output Grid (reflected Input Grid)
Relationships:
  - The Output Grid is a reflection of the Input Grid.
  - The type of reflection (horizontal or vertical) is determined by the specific non-zero digit present in the Input Grid.
