task_description: "Rotate non-zero digits clockwise within concentric layers of a 2D grid."
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  element_type: integer
  value_range: 0-9
  background_value: 0
  size: 5x5 (constant across examples)
objects:
  - name: grid_cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - coordinate: (row, column)
  - name: non_zero_digit
    properties:
      - value: integer (1-9)
      - initial_coordinate: (row, column) in input grid
      - final_coordinate: (row, column) in output grid
  - name: concentric_layer
    properties:
      - layer_index: integer (0 for outermost, increasing inwards)
      - coordinates: list of (row, column) tuples defining the layer path clockwise
relationships:
  - type: containment
    subject: non_zero_digit
    object: concentric_layer
    description: Each non-zero digit belongs to a specific concentric layer based on its coordinates.
  - type: spatial
    subject: non_zero_digit
    object: non_zero_digit
    description: Non-zero digits within the same layer have a clockwise positional relationship.
actions:
  - name: identify_layers
    description: Determine the coordinates belonging to each concentric layer of the grid.
  - name: extract_non_zero_elements
    description: For each layer, identify the coordinates containing non-zero digits.
  - name: rotate_elements
    description: >
      For each layer, map each non-zero digit's value from its original position
      in the input grid to the position of the *previous* non-zero digit
      encountered clockwise within that layer in the output grid.
      Equivalently, determine the value for each non-zero position in the output
      grid by taking the value from the *next* non-zero position clockwise
      in the input grid.
  - name: preserve_zeroes
    description: Zero values remain in their original positions unless replaced by a rotated non-zero digit. (Implicit in the rotation logic focusing only on non-zero positions).
