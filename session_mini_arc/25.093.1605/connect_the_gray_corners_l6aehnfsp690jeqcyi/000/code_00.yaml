Objects:
  - name: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 5x5 in examples)
      - cell_values: [0, 1, 5] (0 and 5 in input, 0, 1, 5 in output)
  - name: Cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0, 1, or 5)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
      - neighbors: adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Cells can be adjacent horizontally or vertically.
  - Transformation Trigger: A cell with value 5 triggers a change in adjacent cells with value 0.

Actions:
  - Identify cells with value 5 in the input grid.
  - For each cell with value 5, identify its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).
  - If an adjacent cell has a value of 0 in the input grid, change its value to 1 in the output grid.
  - Cells that originally had value 5 remain 5 in the output grid.
  - Cells that originally had value 0 and are not adjacent to any 5 remain 0 in the output grid.
