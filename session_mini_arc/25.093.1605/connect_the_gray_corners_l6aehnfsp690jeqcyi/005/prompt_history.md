**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a 2D grid of numbers (representing colors). The input grids contain the numbers 0 and 5. The output grids contain the numbers 0, 1, and 5. The transformation appears to involve changing some of the 0s to 1s based on their proximity to the 5s. The positions and values of the 5s remain unchanged from input to output. The change from 0 to 1 seems to occur for cells that are directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a cell containing a 5.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Objects:
  - name: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 5x5 in examples)
      - cell_values: [0, 1, 5] (0 and 5 in input, 0, 1, 5 in output)
  - name: Cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0, 1, or 5)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
      - neighbors: adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Cells can be adjacent horizontally or vertically.
  - Transformation Trigger: A cell with value 5 triggers a change in adjacent cells with value 0.

Actions:
  - Identify cells with value 5 in the input grid.
  - For each cell with value 5, identify its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).
  - If an adjacent cell has a value of 0 in the input grid, change its value to 1 in the output grid.
  - Cells that originally had value 5 remain 5 in the output grid.
  - Cells that originally had value 0 and are not adjacent to any 5 remain 0 in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially copying all values from the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid.
3.  If the value of the input cell `input[r][c]` is 0:
    a.  Check its neighbors (up: `input[r-1][c]`, down: `input[r+1][c]`, left: `input[r][c-1]`, right: `input[r][c+1]`), making sure to stay within the grid boundaries.
    b.  If any of these valid neighbors has a value of 5 in the *input* grid, set the value of the corresponding cell in the *output* grid `output[r][c]` to 1.
4.  If the value of the input cell `input[r][c]` is 5, keep the value 5 in the output grid `output[r][c]`.
5.  Return the modified output grid.

## General Assessment

The initial hypothesis, based on the first example, suggested that 0s become 1s if they are directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a 5. Testing this against further examples revealed this was incorrect. Example 4, in particular, showed a cell `(3, 2)` that is adjacent to two 5s (above and below) but remains 0 in the expected output.

The provided code (`code_00.py`) implements a different rule: a 0 becomes a 1 if it lies on a clear (containing only 0s) straight horizontal or vertical path between two 5s in the input grid. This rule correctly explains the transformations in examples 1, 2, and 3.

However, when applied to example 4, this "clear path" rule results in an output that differs from the expected output at cell `(3, 2)`. The code predicts 1 (due to the clear vertical path between `input[2][2]=5` and `input[4][2]=5`), while the expected output is 0.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Assume the "Clear Path" Rule:** Based on its success in the first three examples and its logical structure, we will proceed with the "clear path" rule as the most likely intended transformation.
2.  **Acknowledge Discrepancy:** Note the failure point in example 4. This could indicate either an error in the provided expected output for example 4 or a more complex rule not yet fully captured.
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the Facts and Natural Language Program to accurately describe the "clear path" rule.
4.  **Gather Metrics:** Use code execution to confirm the inputs, outputs, and the specific discrepancy observed in example 4 based on the "clear path" rule.

## Facts


```yaml
Objects:
  - name: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 5x5 in examples)
      - cell_values_input: [0, 5]
      - cell_values_output: [0, 1, 5]
  - name: Cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0, 1, or 5)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
  - name: Path Segment
    properties:
      - type: Horizontal or Vertical sequence of cells
      - endpoints: Two cells with value 5 in the input grid
      - interior: Sequence of cells strictly between the endpoints
      - condition: All interior cells must have value 0 in the input grid ("clear path")

Relationships:
  - Transformation_Condition: A cell's value can change from 0 to 1 based on its position relative to cells with value 5.
  - Path_Membership: A cell with value 0 in the input grid might belong to one or more clear horizontal or vertical path segments between two 5s.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all cells with value 5 in the input grid.
  - Scan: For each cell `(r, c)` with value 0 in the input grid:
      a. Search Horizontally: Find the nearest cell with value 5 to the left (`L`) and nearest cell with value 5 to the right (`R`) in the same row `r`.
      b. Check Horizontal Path: If both `L` and `R` exist, verify that all cells between `L` and `R` (i.e., at `input[r][L+1 ... R-1]`) have value 0 in the input grid. If true, mark cell `(r, c)` for change to 1.
      c. Search Vertically: Find the nearest cell with value 5 above (`U`) and nearest cell with value 5 below (`D`) in the same column `c`.
      d. Check Vertical Path: If both `U` and `D` exist, verify that all cells between `U` and `D` (i.e., at `input[U+1 ... D-1][c]`) have value 0 in the input grid. If true, mark cell `(r, c)` for change to 1.
  - Update: Create an output grid, initially copying the input grid. Change the value to 1 in the output grid for any cell `(r, c)` that was marked for change in the previous step (either by horizontal or vertical path check).
  - Preserve: Cells with value 5 in the input remain 5 in the output. Cells with value 0 that were not marked for change remain 0.

Notes:
  - The transformation is based solely on the input grid state.
  - The "clear path" rule, as defined, correctly predicts outputs for examples 1-3 but fails for example 4 at position (3, 2), suggesting a potential issue with the example or a missing nuance in the rule.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid.
3.  If the value of the cell `input[r][c]` is 0:
    a.  **Check Horizontal Path:**
        i.  Find the column index `c_left` of the nearest cell containing 5 to the left of `c` in row `r`.
        ii. Find the column index `c_right` of the nearest cell containing 5 to the right of `c` in row `r`.
        iii.If both `c_left` and `c_right` are found:
            1.  Check if all cells in the input grid between `(r, c_left)` and `(r, c_right)` (exclusive of endpoints) have a value of 0.
            2.  If the path is clear, set the value of the corresponding cell in the *output* grid `output[r][c]` to 1 and proceed to the next cell (skip vertical check for this cell).
    b.  **Check Vertical Path:** (Only if the horizontal check did not result in changing the cell to 1)
        i.  Find the row index `r_up` of the nearest cell containing 5 above `r` in column `c`.
        ii. Find the row index `r_down` of the nearest cell containing 5 below `r` in column `c`.
        iii.If both `r_up` and `r_down` are found:
            1.  Check if all cells in the input grid between `(r_up, c)` and `(r_down, c)` (exclusive of endpoints) have a value of 0.
            2.  If the path is clear, set the value of the corresponding cell in the *output* grid `output[r][c]` to 1.
4.  Return the final output grid.
