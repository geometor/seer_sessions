The fives in the input grid form a connected shape. The position of the single '1' in the output grid appears to be determined by the horizontal positioning of the shape formed by the fives in the input grid. Specifically, the index of the leftmost column containing a '5' dictates the position of the '1' in the output's first row.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
