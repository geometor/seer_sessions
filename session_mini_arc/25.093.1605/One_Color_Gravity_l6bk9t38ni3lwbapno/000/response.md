*   **Perception:**
    The task involves transforming a 5x5 input grid containing binary values (0s and 1s) into a 5x5 output grid. The input grids feature scattered 1s, while the output grids consistently have all 0s except for the bottom-most row (row index 4). The pattern in the last row of the output seems to depend on the column positions of the 1s in the input grid. Specifically, if any cell within a column in the input grid contains a 1, the corresponding cell in the *last row* of the output grid becomes 1. All other cells in the output grid are set to 0. This transformation essentially projects the presence of a '1' in any row of a given column down onto the last row of the output grid for that same column.

      steps:
        - action: initialize_output
          details: Create a 5x5 grid filled with 0s.
        - action: iterate_columns
          target: input_grid
          range: column index 0 to 4
          sub_steps:
            - action: check_column_for_one
              details: Check if any cell in the current column of the input grid has a value of 1.
            - action: update_output_last_row
              condition: If a 1 was found in the input column.
              details: Set the cell in the output grid at row index 4 and the current column index to 1.
      relationship: The value of a cell in the last row of the output grid (output[4][col]) is 1 if and only if there exists at least one row (row_idx from 0 to 4) such that the input grid cell at input[row_idx][col] is 1. Otherwise, output[4][col] is 0. All other output cells (output[0-3][col]) are always 0.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a new 5x5 output grid and initialize all its cells to 0.
    2.  For each column index `c` from 0 to 4:
        a.  Scan the entire column `c` in the input grid (from row 0 to 4).
        b.  Check if any cell in this column `c` of the input grid contains the value 1.
        c.  If at least one cell in column `c` of the input grid is 1, then set the value of the cell in the output grid at row index 4 and column index `c` to 1.
    3.  Return the modified output grid.
