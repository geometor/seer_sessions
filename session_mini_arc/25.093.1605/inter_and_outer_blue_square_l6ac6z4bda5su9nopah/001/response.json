If the cell value `input_grid[r][c]` is not 0, it remains unchanged in the output grid.\n2. If the cell value `input_grid[r][c]` is 0, check its orthogonal neighbors:\n    a) If the cell is directly between two '5's vertically (neighbor above and neighbor below are both 5), the output cell becomes 1.\n    b) If the cell is directly between two '5's horizontally (neighbor left and neighbor right are both 5), the output cell becomes 1.\n    c) If the cell has exactly one orthogonal neighbor with value 2 AND exactly one orthogonal neighbor with value 5, the output cell becomes 1.\n    d) If the cell has exactly one orthogonal neighbor with value 2 AND zero orthogonal neighbors with value 5, the output cell becomes 1.\n3.
