The transformation acts like a reflection and rearrangement of the grid parts relative to this line.\n\n1.  **Input/Output:** Both are 5x5 grids containing integer values (representing colors or categories, e.g., 0, 1, 4, 7).\n2.  **Key Element:** A row or column consisting entirely of the number '4'. This line acts as a pivot or axis for the transformation. In all examples, there is exactly one such line.\n3.  **Transformation Type:** The transformation involves reflection and repositioning.\n    *   If the pivot is a **row**, the parts of the grid *above* and *below* this row are reflected **horizontally**. These reflected parts then swap positions vertically, and the pivot row itself is moved to a new vertical position.\n    *   If the pivot is a **column**, the parts of the grid *left* and *right* of this column are reflected **vertically**. These reflected parts then swap positions horizontally, and the pivot column itself is moved to a new horizontal position.\n4.  **Pivot Line Movement:** The pivot line's new index is determined by reflecting its original index across the center of the grid. If the grid dimension is `D` (5 in this case) and the original index is `i` (0-based), the new index is `(D - 1) - i`.\n5.  **Symmetry Cases:** When the pivot line is exactly in the middle (row index 2 or column index 2 for a 5x5 grid), the transformation might result in the original grid if the sections on either side are reflections of each other relative to the required axis (horizontal reflection for row pivot, vertical reflection for column pivot). Examples `train_2` and `train_5` illustrate this.\n6.  **Inverse Property:** The transformation appears to be its own inverse, as demonstrated by `train_1` and `train_4` being inverse pairs. Applying the transformation twice returns the original grid.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"
