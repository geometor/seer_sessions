```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rule:
1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
3. If a cell in the input grid has a value of '0':
    a. Check its eight neighbors (orthogonal and diagonal) in the input grid.
    b. If at least one neighbor has a non-zero value, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to '1'.
4. Cells that were non-zero in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.
