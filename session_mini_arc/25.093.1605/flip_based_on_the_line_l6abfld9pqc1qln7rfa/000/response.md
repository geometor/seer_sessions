Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** Both input and output are numerical grids (matrices) of the same dimensions within each example pair.
2.  **Content:** The grids contain integer values, where '0' typically represents a background color/state, and non-zero numbers represent foreground patterns or objects.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation modifies the input grid to produce the output grid. The modifications appear to involve spatial rearrangement (like reflection) or specific cell value changes, depending on the characteristics of the non-zero pattern in the input.
4.  **Pattern Characteristics:** Key features seem to be the shape, position, and extent of the non-zero pattern, specifically:
    *   Which edges of the grid the pattern touches (top, bottom, left, right).
    *   The bounding box of the pattern (minimum/maximum row/column indices).
    *   The dimensions (height, width) of this bounding box.
    *   The distribution of non-zero elements within the pattern (e.g., the row with the most non-zero elements).

**Facts:**
