Grid:
  Properties:
    - Type: 2D array of integers
    - Dimensions: 5x5
Sections:
  - Name: Top
    Rows: [0, 1]
  - Name: Middle
    Rows: [2]
    Properties:
      - Static: True (remains unchanged from input to output)
  - Name: Bottom
    Rows: [3, 4]
Cell:
  Properties:
    - Value: Integer
    - Position: (row, column)
Transformation:
  Action: Conditional cell value replacement between Top and Bottom sections
  Rule:
    - Create an output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
    - Process Top Section (rows 0, 1):
      - For each cell at (r, c):
        - Get the value 'v_bottom' from the corresponding input cell in the Bottom section at (r+3, c).
        - If 'v_bottom' is not zero:
          - Set the output cell value at (r, c) to 'v_bottom'.
    - Process Bottom Section (rows 3, 4):
      - For each cell at (r, c):
        - Get the value 'v_top' from the corresponding input cell in the Top section at (r-3, c).
        - If 'v_top' is not zero:
          - Set the output cell value at (r, c) to 'v_top'.
  Relationship:
    - Mapping: Cells in Top section (r, c) correspond to cells in Bottom section (r+3, c).
    - Mapping: Cells in Bottom section (r, c) correspond to cells in Top section (r-3, c).
    - Condition: Replacement depends on the non-zero status of the value in the corresponding cell of the *opposite* section in the *original input*.
