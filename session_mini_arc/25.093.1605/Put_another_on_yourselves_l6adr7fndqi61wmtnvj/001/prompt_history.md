```

Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are consistently 5x5 grids containing single-digit integers.
2.  **Static Middle Row:** The middle row (row index 2) appears identical in the input and output across all examples (`5 5 5 5 5`). This suggests it's either ignored or treated differently.
3.  **Top/Bottom Interaction:** The changes occur exclusively in the top two rows (rows 0, 1) and the bottom two rows (rows 3, 4). The pattern of changes suggests an interaction or mapping between these two sections.
4.  **Conditional Replacement:** Looking at column-wise comparisons between input and output, it seems values are copied *conditionally* between the top and bottom sections. For instance, in `train_1`, column 1, the `7`s from the bottom input `(3,1)` and `(4,1)` appear in the top output `(0,1)` and `(1,1)`. Conversely, the `6`s from the top input `(0,2)`, `(0,3)`, `(0,4)`, `(1,0)`, `(1,1)`, `(1,2)` appear in the bottom output `(3,2)`, `(3,3)`, `(3,4)`, `(4,0)`, `(4,1)`, `(4,2)`.
5.  **Non-Zero Trigger:** The replacement seems triggered by *non-zero* values. If a cell in the source section (e.g., bottom) has a non-zero value, it overwrites the value in the corresponding cell in the destination section (e.g., top). If the source cell is zero, the destination cell retains its original value. This occurs simultaneously for both directions (top influencing bottom, bottom influencing top), using the original input values for the checks.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - Type: 2D array of integers
    - Dimensions: 5x5
Sections:
  - Name: Top
    Rows: [0, 1]
  - Name: Middle
    Rows: [2]
    Properties:
      - Static: True (remains unchanged from input to output)
  - Name: Bottom
    Rows: [3, 4]
Cell:
  Properties:
    - Value: Integer
    - Position: (row, column)
Transformation:
  Action: Conditional cell value replacement between Top and Bottom sections
  Rule:
    - Create an output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
    - Process Top Section (rows 0, 1):
      - For each cell at (r, c):
        - Get the value 'v_bottom' from the corresponding input cell in the Bottom section at (r+3, c).
        - If 'v_bottom' is not zero:
          - Set the output cell value at (r, c) to 'v_bottom'.
    - Process Bottom Section (rows 3, 4):
      - For each cell at (r, c):
        - Get the value 'v_top' from the corresponding input cell in the Top section at (r-3, c).
        - If 'v_top' is not zero:
          - Set the output cell value at (r, c) to 'v_top'.
  Relationship:
    - Mapping: Cells in Top section (r, c) correspond to cells in Bottom section (r+3, c).
    - Mapping: Cells in Bottom section (r, c) correspond to cells in Top section (r-3, c).
    - Condition: Replacement depends on the non-zero status of the value in the corresponding cell of the *opposite* section in the *original input*.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input 5x5 grid.
2.  Create a new 5x5 grid for the output, initially making it an exact copy of the input grid.
3.  Identify the top section (rows 0, 1), the middle row (row 2), and the bottom section (rows 3, 4).
4.  The middle row (row 2) of the output grid remains unchanged from the input grid.
5.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` in the top section (rows 0 and 1) of the output grid:
    *   Look at the value in the corresponding cell `(r+3, c)` in the bottom section of the *original input grid*.
    *   If this value from the input grid's bottom section is *not* zero, replace the value at `(r, c)` in the *output grid* with this non-zero value.
6.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` in the bottom section (rows 3 and 4) of the output grid:
    *   Look at the value in the corresponding cell `(r-3, c)` in the top section of the *original input grid*.
    *   If this value from the input grid's top section is *not* zero, replace the value at `(r, c)` in the *output grid* with this non-zero value.
7.  The resulting modified grid is the final output.
