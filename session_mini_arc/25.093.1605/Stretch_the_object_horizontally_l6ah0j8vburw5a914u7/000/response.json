            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided input-output pairs to understand the transformation logic.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both 2D grids of the same dimensions (5x5 in the examples).\n2.  **Cell Values:** The cells contain integer values, primarily '0' and '3'. The value '3' appears to be the active element being manipulated, while '0' represents the background.\n3.  **Transformation Scope:** The transformation operates independently on each row. Rows containing only '0's in the input remain unchanged in the output.\n4.  **Row-wise Logic:** For rows containing at least one '3', a specific transformation is applied to generate the corresponding output row.\n5.  **Key Features:** The transformation seems dependent on the positions (indices) of the '3's within the input row, specifically the first ('leftmost') and last ('rightmost') occurrences. The *contiguity* of the '3's in the input row also appears crucial.\n6.  **Output Pattern:** The output rows generated from active input rows always start with a '3' at index 0. The subsequent '3's in the output row depend on the configuration of '3's in the input row.\n    *   If the input row has only one '3', the output row has a '3' only at index 0.\n    *   If the input row has multiple, non-contiguous '3's, the output row seems to have a '3' at index 0 and another '3' at an index calculated from the positions of the first and last '3's in the input.\n    *   If the input row has multiple, contiguous '3's, the output row appears to be filled with '3's from index 0 up to a calculated index.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
