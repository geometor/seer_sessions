Comparing the input and output grids reveals a consistent transformation across all examples. The content of each row remains identical between the input and output, but the vertical order of the rows is inverted. For instance, the top row of the input becomes the bottom row of the output, the second row from the top becomes the second row from the bottom, and so on, with the middle row remaining in the same position. This suggests a vertical flip operation applied to the entire grid.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
