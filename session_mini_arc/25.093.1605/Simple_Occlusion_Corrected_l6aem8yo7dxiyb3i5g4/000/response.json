One object is positioned higher (\"upper object\") in the grid than the other (\"lower object\").\n    *   The output grid is also a 5x5 grid.\n    *   The transformation retains the upper object completely in its original position and color.\n    *   The lower object from the input is entirely removed in the output.\n    *   A single pixel is added to the output grid. This pixel has the color of the upper object. Its position is determined as follows:\n        *   Its row index is the same as the topmost row index of the *original* lower object in the input grid.\n        *   Its column index is the same as the column index of the top-most, left-most pixel of the *upper* object in the input grid.\n    *   All other cells in the output grid, specifically those below the upper object and not part of the single added pixel, are set to 0 (background).\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
