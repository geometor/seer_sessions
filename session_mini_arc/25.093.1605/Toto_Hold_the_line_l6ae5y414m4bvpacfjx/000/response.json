The transformation modifies some of the 0s in the input grid into 8s in the output grid, while the positions of the original 8s remain unchanged. The core logic appears to involve identifying specific 0s based on their neighboring 8s. Specifically, a 0 seems to turn into an 8 if it lies directly between two 8s, either horizontally or vertically.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
