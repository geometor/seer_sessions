Schema:
  Objects:
    - Grid: A 2D array representing the input and output states.
      Properties:
        - cells: A list of lists containing integer values.
        - dimensions: (height, width) of the grid.
    - Cell: An individual element within the grid.
      Properties:
        - value: An integer (0, 2, or 4).
        - position: (row, column) coordinates within the grid.
        - neighbors: Orthogonally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).
  Relationships:
    - Adjacency: Cells sharing a horizontal or vertical edge.
    - Source: Cells with value 4 act as sources for transformation.
    - Target: Cells with value 0 are potential targets for transformation.
    - Effect: Cells with value 2 are the result of the transformation.
  Actions:
    - Identify: Locate all cells with value 4 in the input grid.
    - Check Neighbors: For each cell with value 4, examine its orthogonal neighbors.
    - Conditional Update: If a neighbor cell exists within the grid boundaries and has a value of 0 in the input grid, change its value to 2 in the output grid.
    - Preserve: Maintain the original values of cells containing 4 and cells containing 0 that are not adjacent to any 4s.
