The transformation appears to operate on a row-by-row basis, where specific rows from the input grid are selected and potentially duplicated to form the rows of the output grid. The relative positions of the 0s and 1s within the selected rows are preserved. The key is to identify which input rows are used to construct which output rows.\n\nObserving the examples:\n- The first row (index 0) of the input seems to consistently map directly to the first row (index 0) of the output.\n- The fourth row (index 3) of the input seems to be copied to both the second and third rows (indices 1 and 2) of the output.\n- The fifth row (index 4) of the input seems to be copied to both the fourth and fifth rows (indices 3 and 4) of the output.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
