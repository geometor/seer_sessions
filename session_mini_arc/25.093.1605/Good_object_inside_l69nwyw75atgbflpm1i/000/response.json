            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both 5x5 grids of integers.\n2.  **Border Element:** The number `6` consistently forms a one-cell thick border around the grid in both input and output. This border remains unchanged by the transformation.\n3.  **Inner Grid:** The core transformation occurs within the central 3x3 subgrid (rows 1-3, columns 1-3, using 0-based indexing).\n4.  **Cell Values:** Inside the inner grid, we see the number `0` and other non-zero numbers (`2`, `3`, `4` in the examples). `0` appears to represent an empty or background state.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The non-zero numbers within the inner grid seem to \"fall\" or propagate downwards. If a cell contains a non-zero number and the cell directly below it contains `0`, the `0` is replaced by that non-zero number. This propagation continues downwards column by column. It appears multiple cells in a column can be filled by the same falling number if there are consecutive zeros below it. The process seems to repeat or settle until all possible downward propagations within the inner grid have occurred.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
