            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output:** The task takes a 2D grid (matrix) as input and produces another 2D grid of the same dimensions as output.\n2.  **Grid Contents:**\n    *   Input grids contain only the numbers 0 and 5.\n    *   Output grids contain numbers 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.\n3.  **Key Observation:** The positions of the number 5 remain unchanged between the input and output grids.\n4.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation primarily involves changing some of the 0s in the input grid to the numbers 3, 6, 7, or 9 in the output grid.\n5.  **Spatial Relationship:** The new numbers (3, 6, 7, 9) appear in specific locations *relative* to the positions of the 5s. Examining the examples reveals a consistent pattern:\n    *   A 6 appears at the top-left diagonal neighbor of a 5.\n    *   A 9 appears at the top-right diagonal neighbor of a 5.\n    *   A 7 appears at the bottom-left diagonal neighbor of a 5.\n    *   A 3 appears at the bottom-right diagonal neighbor of a 5.\n6.  **Boundary Conditions:** This placement only occurs if the target diagonal neighbor cell is within the grid boundaries.\n7.  **Overlapping Influence:** If a cell is a diagonal neighbor to multiple 5s (as seen in Example 2, cell (2,3) is TR to 5 at (3,2) and potentially related to 5 at (1,3)), the rule derived from the examples indicates that the placement happens regardless of the cell's current value (unless it's a 5 itself, which doesn't occur with this diagonal pattern). The value placed seems determined solely by the relative position to the *current* 5 being processed. Since the final outputs are consistent regardless of processing order, it implies overwriting occurs, and the final state reflects all applied patterns.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
