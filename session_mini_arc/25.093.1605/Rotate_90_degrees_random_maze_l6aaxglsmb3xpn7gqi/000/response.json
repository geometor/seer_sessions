The zeros in the input don't seem to directly map; rather, the output grid is initially empty (all zeros), and the non-zero values are placed according to a rule.\n4.  **Positional Change:** Comparing the positions of identical non-zero numbers between input and output suggests a geometric transformation. Testing standard transformations (reflection, transposition, rotation), a 90-degree clockwise rotation appears to match the mapping in Examples 2 and 3, and most mappings in Example 1.\n    *   Specifically, a number at input position (row `r`, column `c`) moves to output position (column `c`, row `N-1-r`), where `N` is the grid dimension (5 in this case).\n5.  **Discrepancy:** There's a potential inconsistency in Example 1. The number 6 at input position (3, 3) should map to output position (3, 5-1-3) = (3, 1) according to the 90-degree clockwise rotation rule. However, the provided output shows a 6 at position (3, 0). Given that Examples 2 and 3 perfectly fit the rotation rule, this single discrepancy in Example 1 might be an error in the example itself. The most consistent rule across all examples is the 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
