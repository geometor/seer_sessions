Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** Both input and output are 5x5 grids containing single-digit non-negative integers (0-9).
2.  **Content:** The grids contain mostly zeros, acting as a background, with some non-zero digits scattered throughout.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves repositioning the non-zero digits from the input grid to new locations in the output grid. The zeros in the input don't seem to directly map; rather, the output grid is initially empty (all zeros), and the non-zero values are placed according to a rule.
4.  **Positional Change:** Comparing the positions of identical non-zero numbers between input and output suggests a geometric transformation. Testing standard transformations (reflection, transposition, rotation), a 90-degree clockwise rotation appears to match the mapping in Examples 2 and 3, and most mappings in Example 1.
    *   Specifically, a number at input position (row `r`, column `c`) moves to output position (column `c`, row `N-1-r`), where `N` is the grid dimension (5 in this case).
5.  **Discrepancy:** There's a potential inconsistency in Example 1. The number 6 at input position (3, 3) should map to output position (3, 5-1-3) = (3, 1) according to the 90-degree clockwise rotation rule. However, the provided output shows a 6 at position (3, 0). Given that Examples 2 and 3 perfectly fit the rotation rule, this single discrepancy in Example 1 might be an error in the example itself. The most consistent rule across all examples is the 90-degree clockwise rotation.

**Facts:**

Domain: Grid Transformation
Input_Type: 2D Grid (5x5) of Integers (0-9)
Output_Type: 2D Grid (5x5) of Integers (0-9)
Core_Operation: Geometric Transformation (Rotation)

Grid_Properties:
  - Size: 5x5
  - Element_Type: Integer
  - Range: 0-9
  - Background_Value: 0

Objects:
  - Name: Input_Grid
    Properties: [Size=5x5, Elements=Integers(0-9)]

    Properties: [Size=5x5, Elements=Integers(0-9)]
  - Name: Cell

    Properties: [Value(1-9), Original_Position(r, c), Transformed_Position(r', c')]

Transformation_Rule:
  - Name: Rotate_Clockwise_90_Degrees
  - Description: Each cell value from the input grid at (r, c) is moved to the output grid at (c, 4-r).
  - Input_Coordinates: (r, c)
  - Output_Coordinates: (c, 4-r)  # Assuming 0-based indexing and N=5
  - Handling_Zeros: Output grid cells default to 0 unless a non-zero value maps to them.

Relationships:
  - Mapping: Input_Cell(r, c) maps to Output_Cell(c, 4-r).
  - Value_Preservation: The numerical value of non-zero elements is preserved during the transformation.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty 5x5 output grid, filling all cells with the value 0.
2.  Examine each cell of the input grid, identifying its row index `r` and column index `c` (from 0 to 4).
3.  Retrieve the value `v` located at the input cell (`r`, `c`).
4.  If the value `v` is not 0:
    a.  Calculate the corresponding output coordinates (`r'`, `c'`) based on a 90-degree clockwise rotation: `r'` is the original column `c`, and `c'` is `4 - r` (where 4 is the maximum index for a 5x5 grid).
    b.  Assign the value `v` to the output grid cell at the calculated coordinates (`r'`, `c'`).
5.  After processing all cells from the input grid, the populated output grid represents the final result.
