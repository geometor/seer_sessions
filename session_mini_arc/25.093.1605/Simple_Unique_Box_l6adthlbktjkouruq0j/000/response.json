Each input grid contains exactly one digit that is neither 0 nor 1 (specifically 3 or 4 in the examples). Let's call this the \"special digit\".\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The output grid is predominantly filled with 0s. The special digit from the input grid is relocated to one of the four corners of the output grid. The original position of the special digit and its value seem to determine which corner it moves to.\n4.  **Background:** The '1' values in the input seem to form some kind of shape or context but are ultimately erased in the output, replaced by 0s. Their role might be implicit in defining the context for the special digit, but the direct transformation focuses only on the special digit.\n5.  **Corner Mapping Logic:**\n    *   In `train_1`, the special digit 4 at (row=2, col=3) moves to the bottom-right corner (4, 4).\n    *   In `train_2`, the special digit 4 at (row=2, col=2) moves to the top-right corner (0, 4).\n    *   In `train_3`, the special digit 3 at (row=2, col=2) moves to the bottom-left corner (4, 0).\n    *   This indicates that *both* the value of the special digit *and* its original coordinates determine the destination corner.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
