"""
Transforms a 5x5 input grid containing mostly 0s and 1s, and a single 
'special' digit (3 or 4 in the examples), into a 5x5 output grid.

The output grid is initialized with all 0s. The special digit from the 
input grid is then moved to one of the four corners of the output grid. 
The specific corner is determined by the value of the special digit and 
its original coordinates in the input grid based on observed rules.

Observed Rules:
- If the special digit is 3 at (2, 2), it moves to the bottom-left (4, 0).
- If the special digit is 4 at (2, 2), it moves to the top-right (0, 4).
- If the special digit is 4 at (2, 3), it moves to the bottom-right (4, 4).
