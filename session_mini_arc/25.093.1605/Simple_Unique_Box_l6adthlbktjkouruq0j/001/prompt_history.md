Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are represented as 5x5 grids containing single-digit integers.
2.  **Value Palette:** The grids primarily use 0s and 1s. Each input grid contains exactly one digit that is neither 0 nor 1 (specifically 3 or 4 in the examples). Let's call this the "special digit".
3.  **Core Transformation:** The output grid is predominantly filled with 0s. The special digit from the input grid is relocated to one of the four corners of the output grid. The original position of the special digit and its value seem to determine which corner it moves to.
4.  **Background:** The '1' values in the input seem to form some kind of shape or context but are ultimately erased in the output, replaced by 0s. Their role might be implicit in defining the context for the special digit, but the direct transformation focuses only on the special digit.
5.  **Corner Mapping Logic:**
    *   In `train_1`, the special digit 4 at (row=2, col=3) moves to the bottom-right corner (4, 4).
    *   In `train_2`, the special digit 4 at (row=2, col=2) moves to the top-right corner (0, 4).
    *   In `train_3`, the special digit 3 at (row=2, col=2) moves to the bottom-left corner (4, 0).
    *   This indicates that *both* the value of the special digit *and* its original coordinates determine the destination corner.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_size: [5, 5]
  value_set: [0, 1, 3, 4] # Observed values
  background_value: 0
  structure_value: 1 # Appears structural but is removed in output
  special_values: [3, 4] # Values that are relocated

objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: [5, 5]
      - cells: contains integer values (0, 1, 3, 4)
      - special_cell: contains exactly one cell with a value not equal to 0 or 1
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: [5, 5]
      - cells: contains integer values (mostly 0)
      - target_cell: contains the special_value at one corner
  - name: special_cell
    type: cell
    properties:
      - value: V (e.g., 3 or 4)
      - coordinates: (r, c) (row, column index)

actions:
  - name: find_special_cell
    input: input_grid
    output: special_cell (value V, coordinates (r, c))
    description: Iterate through the input grid to locate the unique cell whose value is not 0 and not 1.
  - name: determine_target_corner
    input: special_cell (value V, coordinates (r, c))
    output: target_coordinates (tr, tc)
    description: Apply a rule based on V, r, and c to select one of the four corner coordinates.
      - Rule observed:
        - If V=3, r=2, c=2 => target=(4, 0) # Bottom-Left
        - If V=4, r=2, c=2 => target=(0, 4) # Top-Right
        - If V=4, r=2, c=3 => target=(4, 4) # Bottom-Right
  - name: create_output_grid
    input: grid_size, background_value
    output: output_grid (initialized)
    description: Generate a grid of the specified size filled with the background value (0).
  - name: place_value
    input: output_grid, target_coordinates (tr, tc), special_value V
    output: output_grid (modified)
    description: Update the cell at the target coordinates in the output grid with the special value V.

relationships:
  - The value and coordinates of the special_cell in the input_grid determine the coordinates of the target_cell in the output_grid.
  - The value of the target_cell in the output_grid is the same as the value of the special_cell in the input_grid.
  - All other cells in the output_grid have the background_value (0).
  - The dimensions of the output_grid are the same as the input_grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the unique cell in the 5x5 input grid that contains a value `V` which is neither 0 nor 1. Record this value `V` and its coordinates `(r, c)`.
2.  **Initialize** a new 5x5 output grid, filling all its cells with 0.
3.  **Determine** the target corner coordinates `(tr, tc)` for the output grid based on the identified value `V` and coordinates `(r, c)` from the input grid using the following specific rules:
    *   If `V` is 3 and `(r, c)` is (2, 2), set the target corner `(tr, tc)` to (4, 0).
    *   If `V` is 4 and `(r, c)` is (2, 2), set the target corner `(tr, tc)` to (0, 4).
    *   If `V` is 4 and `(r, c)` is (2, 3), set the target corner `(tr, tc)` to (4, 4).
4.  **Place** the recorded value `V` into the initialized output grid at the determined target corner coordinates `(tr, tc)`.
5.  **Output** the resulting grid.
