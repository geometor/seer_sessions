Grid:
  Properties:
    - type: 2D array of integers
    - dimensions: 5x5 (consistent in examples)
    - contains_cells: true
Cell:
  Properties:
    - value: integer
    - location: (row, column)
Objects:
  - Input Grid: The starting state.
  - Output Grid: The final state.
  - Trigger Number (T):
      Properties:
        - non_zero: true
        - unique_in_input: true (relative to other non-zero, non-background numbers)
        - determines_fill_value: true
      Location: (r_trigger, c_trigger) in the input grid.
  - Zero Cells: Cells with value 0 in the input grid. These are candidates for being filled.
  - Target Corner: The corner from which the fill process starts in the output grid. Determined by the Trigger Number's location.
Relationships:
  - Trigger Number Location determines Target Corner:
      - Top-Left quadrant -> Bottom-Right corner
      - Bottom-Right quadrant -> Top-Left corner
      - Bottom-Left quadrant -> Top-Right corner
      - Top-Right quadrant -> Bottom-Left corner
  - Fill Propagation: The Trigger Number fills Zero Cells starting from the Target Corner.
Action:
  - Identify Trigger Number (T) and its location (r_trigger, c_trigger) in the input grid.
  - Create the output grid, initially copying the input grid.
  - Set the cell at (r_trigger, c_trigger) in the output grid to 0.
  - Determine the Target Corner (r_start, c_start) based on (r_trigger, c_trigger).
  - Perform a propagation (like BFS/DFS) starting from (r_start, c_start):
      - If the current cell (r, c) in the *input* grid is 0:
          - Set the cell (r, c) in the *output* grid to T.
          - Continue propagation to neighboring cells.
      - If the current cell (r, c) in the *input* grid is non-zero:
          - Stop propagation along this path.
