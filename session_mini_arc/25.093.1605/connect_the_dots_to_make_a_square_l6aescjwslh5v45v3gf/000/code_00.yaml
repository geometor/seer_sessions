task_description: "Fill grid cells based on shortest paths between two markers, restricted to the bounding box boundary."
elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - size: Consistent across examples (appears to be 5x5)
      - cell_values: [0, 5, 6]
  - element: marker
    properties:
      - identifier: value 6
      - count_in_input: 2
      - role: Defines start and end points for path finding
      - preserved_in_output: true
  - element: filled_cell
    properties:
      - identifier: value 5
      - role: Marks cells on specific shortest paths between markers
      - generated_in_output: true
      - location_rule: Cells must be on a shortest Manhattan path AND on the boundary of the marker bounding box.
  - element: background_cell
    properties:
      - identifier: value 0
      - role: Represents empty space or non-path cells
relationships:
  - relationship: between markers (6) and filled_cells (5)
    type: Geometric path finding
    details: Filled cells (5) are generated on specific shortest Manhattan distance paths connecting the two markers (6).
  - relationship: bounding_box
    type: Geometric constraint
    details: The minimal rectangle enclosing the two markers (6) defines a boundary. Filled cells (5) must lie on this boundary.
actions:
  - action: locate_markers
    inputs: input grid
    outputs: coordinates of two cells with value 6
  - action: calculate_shortest_distance
    inputs: marker coordinates
    outputs: Manhattan distance between markers
  - action: determine_bounding_box
    inputs: marker coordinates
    outputs: min/max row and column indices
  - action: fill_path_cells
    inputs: input grid, marker coordinates, shortest distance, bounding box
    outputs: output grid
    process: Iterate through cells; if a cell is 0, check if it's on a shortest path AND on the bounding box boundary; if yes, change value to 5.
