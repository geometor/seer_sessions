The value from the action cell is then propagated (copied) into other cells based on the properties of the action and target cells.\n3.  **Identifying Action/Target Cells:**\n    *   An \"action\" cell appears to be a cell with a value `V` that is greater than the value `T` of an adjacent non-zero cell. In the examples, the action cell seems to be the one with the highest value that satisfies this condition (3 in Ex1, 4 in Ex2, 8 in Ex3).\n    *   A \"target\" cell is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to the action cell, has a non-zero value `T`, and `T < V`. The specific target cell involved seems to determine the direction of propagation.\n4.  **Propagation Mechanism:**\n    *   The value `V` of the action cell is propagated in a line away from the action cell, starting near the target cell.\n    *   The propagation rule depends on the value `T` of the target cell:\n        *   If `T == 1` (Example 1), `V` cells are filled with the value `V`, starting *after* the target cell in the propagation direction.\n        *   If `T != 1` (Examples 2 and 3, where T=2 and T=6 respectively), cells are filled with the value `V` starting *adjacent* to the target cell in the propagation direction, continuing until the grid boundary is reached.\n5.  **Grid Updates:**\n    *   The action cell's value is set to 0 in the output.\n    *   The target cell retains its original value `T`.\n    *   Other cells are either unchanged or overwritten by the propagation.\n6.  **Uniqueness:** The examples suggest that only one action/target pair triggers the propagation in each grid transformation.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.\n2.  **Identify Action and Target Cells:** Scan the input grid to find a cell `(r, c)` with value `V` (the \"Action Cell\") such that it is adjacent to at least one cell `(tr, tc)` with a non-zero value `T` (the \"Target Cell\") where `V > T`. Assume the Action Cell is the one with the highest value `V` that satisfies this condition across the entire grid. Identify the specific Target Cell `(tr, tc)` that corresponds to the observed transformation (in the examples, only one adjacent cell seems to lead to the correct output propagation path).\n3.  **Determine Propagation Direction:** Define the direction based on the relative positions: if `tr < r`, direction is UP; if `tr > r`, direction is DOWN; if `tc < c`, direction is LEFT; if `tc > c`, direction is RIGHT. This direction represents moving away from the Action Cell, starting from the Target Cell.\n4.  **Execute Propagation based on Target Value:**\n    *   **If the Target Cell's value `T` is 1:** Find the first cell `(nr, nc)` along the propagation direction, starting *after* the Target Cell `(tr, tc)`. Fill this cell `(nr, nc)` and the subsequent `V-1` cells along the same direction with the value `V`. Stop filling if the grid boundary is reached.\n    *   **If the Target Cell's value `T` is not 1:** Find the first cell `(nr, nc)` along the propagation direction, starting *adjacent* to the Target Cell `(tr, tc)`. Fill this cell `(nr, nc)` and all subsequent cells along the same direction with the value `V` until the grid boundary is reached.\n5.  **Finalize Output Grid:**\n    *   In the output grid (initially a copy of the input), set the value of the Action Cell `(r, c)` to 0.\n    *   Update the values of the cells modified during the propagation step.\n    *   Ensure the Target Cell `(tr, tc)` in the output grid retains its original value `T` (it should not be overwritten by propagation or the zeroing of the action cell).\n6.  **Return:** The modified grid is the final output."
