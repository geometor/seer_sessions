task_description: Processes a 2D grid to modify values within specific non-zero structures based on interactions between those structures.

grid_properties:
  type: 2D array of integers
  size: 5x5 (based on examples)
  background_value: 0

identified_objects:
  - object: horizontal_segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of non-zero cells along a single row.
    properties:
      - coordinates: Set of (row, col) tuples defining the segment.
      - values: List or set of non-zero integer values present in the segment cells.
      - unique_values: Set of distinct non-zero values.
    actions:
      - value_swap: If exactly two unique non-zero values (A, B) exist, all cells with A change to B, and all cells with B change to A. If only one unique value exists, values remain unchanged.
  - object: vertical_segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of non-zero cells along a single column, all having the same value.
    properties:
      - coordinates: Set of (row, col) tuples defining the segment.
      - value: The single non-zero integer value present in all segment cells.
    actions:
      - value_assignment: The value of all cells in this segment changes to the original value of the 'isolated_cell'.
  - object: isolated_cell
    description: A single non-zero cell that is not part of the horizontal or vertical segments.
    properties:
      - coordinates: The (row, col) tuple of the cell.
      - value: The non-zero integer value of the cell.
    actions:
      - value_assignment: The value of this cell changes to the original value of the 'vertical_segment'.

relationships:
  - The transformation rule for 'vertical_segment' depends on the initial state of 'isolated_cell'.
  - The transformation rule for 'isolated_cell' depends on the initial state of 'vertical_segment'.
  - The transformation rule for 'horizontal_segment' depends only on its own initial state (its unique values).

assumptions:
  - There is exactly one horizontal segment, one vertical segment, and one isolated cell in each input grid.
  - Segments are defined by contiguous non-zero values along a row or column.
  - The vertical segment always consists of cells with a single, uniform non-zero value.
  - The three structures (horizontal segment, vertical segment, isolated cell) do not spatially overlap in the input grid.
  - Zero cells remain zero in the output.
