Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are consistently 5x5 grids containing non-negative integers. The majority of cells are 0 (background).
2.  **Non-Zero Structures:** The non-zero values form distinct shapes or structures within the grid:
    *   A contiguous vertical line segment (all cells have the same non-zero value).
    *   A contiguous horizontal line segment (cells can have one or two distinct non-zero values).
    *   A single isolated non-zero cell.
3.  **Value Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the *values* within these identified structures, while the *positions* of the structures themselves remain largely unchanged.
4.  **Interaction between Structures:** The transformation rules for the values within each structure seem dependent on the values present in the *other* structures. Specifically:
    *   The new value(s) for the horizontal segment depend on the original values within that segment.
    *   The new value for the vertical segment depends on the original value of the isolated cell.
    *   The new value for the isolated cell depends on the original value of the vertical segment.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Processes a 2D grid to modify values within specific non-zero structures based on interactions between those structures.

grid_properties:
  type: 2D array of integers
  size: 5x5 (based on examples)
  background_value: 0

identified_objects:
  - object: horizontal_segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of non-zero cells along a single row.
    properties:
      - coordinates: Set of (row, col) tuples defining the segment.
      - values: List or set of non-zero integer values present in the segment cells.
      - unique_values: Set of distinct non-zero values.
    actions:
      - value_swap: If exactly two unique non-zero values (A, B) exist, all cells with A change to B, and all cells with B change to A. If only one unique value exists, values remain unchanged.
  - object: vertical_segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of non-zero cells along a single column, all having the same value.
    properties:
      - coordinates: Set of (row, col) tuples defining the segment.
      - value: The single non-zero integer value present in all segment cells.
    actions:
      - value_assignment: The value of all cells in this segment changes to the original value of the 'isolated_cell'.
  - object: isolated_cell
    description: A single non-zero cell that is not part of the horizontal or vertical segments.
    properties:
      - coordinates: The (row, col) tuple of the cell.
      - value: The non-zero integer value of the cell.
    actions:
      - value_assignment: The value of this cell changes to the original value of the 'vertical_segment'.

relationships:
  - The transformation rule for 'vertical_segment' depends on the initial state of 'isolated_cell'.
  - The transformation rule for 'isolated_cell' depends on the initial state of 'vertical_segment'.
  - The transformation rule for 'horizontal_segment' depends only on its own initial state (its unique values).

assumptions:
  - There is exactly one horizontal segment, one vertical segment, and one isolated cell in each input grid.
  - Segments are defined by contiguous non-zero values along a row or column.
  - The vertical segment always consists of cells with a single, uniform non-zero value.
  - The three structures (horizontal segment, vertical segment, isolated cell) do not spatially overlap in the input grid.
  - Zero cells remain zero in the output.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, or as a grid of zeros with the same dimensions.
2.  Identify the coordinates and values of the horizontal segment (contiguous non-zero cells in a single row). Store its unique non-zero values.
3.  Identify the coordinates and the single non-zero value (`V_val`) of the vertical segment (contiguous non-zero cells in a single column with the same value).
4.  Identify the coordinate and the non-zero value (`I_val`) of the isolated cell (the single non-zero cell not belonging to the horizontal or vertical segments).
5.  Determine the value transformation map for the horizontal segment:
    *   If the horizontal segment has exactly two unique non-zero values, `A` and `B`, create a mapping: `{A: B, B: A}`.
    *   If the horizontal segment has only one unique non-zero value, `A`, create a mapping: `{A: A}`.
6.  Iterate through the coordinates of the horizontal segment in the input grid. For each coordinate `(r, c)`, set the corresponding output grid cell `output[r][c]` to the mapped value based on the input value `input[r][c]` and the mapping created in step 5.
7.  Iterate through the coordinates of the vertical segment. For each coordinate `(r, c)`, set the corresponding output grid cell `output[r][c]` to the original value of the isolated cell (`I_val`).
8.  Retrieve the coordinate `(r_i, c_i)` of the isolated cell. Set the output grid cell `output[r_i][c_i]` to the original value of the vertical segment (`V_val`).
9.  Ensure all cells that were originally 0 in the input remain 0 in the output (this is handled if starting with a zero grid and only filling non-zero values, or by skipping zero cells if modifying a copy).
10. Return the completed output grid.
