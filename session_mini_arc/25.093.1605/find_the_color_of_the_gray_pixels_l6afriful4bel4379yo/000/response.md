*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both 5x5 grids containing integer values.
    *   The input grids primarily contain zeros (0) and the digit five (5).
    *   The output grids preserve the locations of the zeros from the input.
    *   The locations that contained the digit five (5) in the input now contain different digits in the output.
    *   The transformation rule appears to be specific to the value '5' and depends on its position (row and column index) within the grid. Other values (specifically '0') remain unchanged.

*   **YAML Fact Document:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - object: grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array
          - dimensions: 5x5
          - cell_values: integers
      - object: cell
        properties:
          - value: integer
          - position: (row_index, column_index)
    transformation:
      action: replace_value
      condition: input cell value is 5
      rule: The output value depends deterministically on the cell's (row, column) coordinates.
      mapping: # Observed coordinate-to-output value mapping for input '5'
        (0, 0): 1
        (0, 2): 1
        (0, 4): 2
        (2, 0): 3
        (2, 2): 4
        (2, 4): 7
        (4, 0): 6
        (4, 2): 8
        (4, 4): 7
      fallback: If input cell value is not 5 (i.e., 0), keep the original value.
    relationships:
      - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
      - Each cell in the output grid corresponds positionally to a cell in the input grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an empty 5x5 output grid.
    2.  Iterate through each cell of the 5x5 input grid, accessing its value and its position (row `r`, column `c`).
    3.  If the value of the input cell at (`r`, `c`) is 5:
        *   Determine the replacement value based on the specific coordinates (`r`, `c`) using the following predefined mapping:
            *   If (`r`, `c`) is (0, 0), the output value is 1.
            *   If (`r`, `c`) is (0, 2), the output value is 1.
            *   If (`r`, `c`) is (0, 4), the output value is 2.
            *   If (`r`, `c`) is (2, 0), the output value is 3.
            *   If (`r`, `c`) is (2, 2), the output value is 4.
            *   If (`r`, `c`) is (2, 4), the output value is 7.
            *   If (`r`, `c`) is (4, 0), the output value is 6.
            *   If (`r`, `c`) is (4, 2), the output value is 8.
            *   If (`r`, `c`) is (4, 4), the output value is 7.
        *   Place this replacement value into the output grid at the corresponding position (`r`, `c`).
    4.  If the value of the input cell at (`r`, `c`) is 0 (or any value other than 5):
        *   Copy the input value directly to the output grid at the corresponding position (`r`, `c`).
    5.  Return the completed output grid.
