task_elements:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array of integers
    properties:
      - background_value: 0
      - foreground_value: non-zero integer (varies per example, consistent within example)
      - dimensions: fixed (e.g., 5x5 in examples)
  - name: pattern_rows
    type: list of rows (1D arrays)
    source: input_grid
    definition: Rows from the input grid that contain at least one non-zero value.
    properties:
      - order: preserved relative order from input grid
  - name: last_pattern_row
    type: row (1D array)
    source: pattern_rows
    definition: The last row in the ordered list of pattern_rows.

actions:
  - name: identify_pattern_rows
    input: input_grid
    output: pattern_rows (ordered list)
    description: Iterate through input grid rows and collect those with any non-zero element.
  - name: construct_output_grid
    input:
      - pattern_rows
      - last_pattern_row
      - output_grid_dimensions (same as input)
    output: output_grid
    description: >
      Create an empty grid. Fill the top rows sequentially with pattern_rows.
      If more rows are needed, fill all remaining rows with last_pattern_row.

relationships:
  - The output grid's content is solely determined by the pattern_rows extracted from the input grid.
  - The number of pattern_rows determines how many unique rows are initially placed in the output grid.
  - The last_pattern_row serves as a repeating filler for the lower portion of the output grid if the pattern_rows do not fill the entire grid height.
