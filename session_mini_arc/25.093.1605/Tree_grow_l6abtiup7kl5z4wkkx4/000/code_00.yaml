task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  cell_type: integer
  size: 5x5 # based on examples, may vary
input_elements:
  - value: 0
    role: background / empty cell
  - value: 9
    role: source / influencer cell
output_elements:
  - value: 0
    role: background / empty cell (unchanged from input, not adjacent to 9)
  - value: 3
    role: affected cell (was 0 in input, adjacent to a 9)
  - value: 9
    role: source / influencer cell (unchanged from input)
transformation_rule:
  - action: copy_grid
    source: input
    target: output # Initialize output as a copy
  - action: iterate_cells
    target: input_grid
    condition: cell value is 0
    sub_action:
      - action: check_neighbors
        target: current_cell_in_input
        neighborhood: Moore (8 adjacent cells including diagonals)
        condition: any neighbor value is 9
        result_if_true: change corresponding output cell value to 3
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: cell with value 0 (input) and cell with value 9 (input)
    effect: causes the 0 cell to become 3 in the output
  - type: identity
    between: cell with value 9 (input) and cell with value 9 (output)
    effect: value preserved
  - type: identity
    between: cell with value 0 (input, not adjacent to 9) and cell with value 0 (output)
    effect: value preserved
