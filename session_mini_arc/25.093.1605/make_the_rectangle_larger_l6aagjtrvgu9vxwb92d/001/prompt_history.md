Okay, let's break down the transformation logic based on the provided examples.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids (5x5 in the examples) containing single-digit integers. The digit '0' represents the background.
2.  **Input Object:** Each input grid contains a single connected component (object) made of a non-zero digit (e.g., 8, 6, 4). These objects vary in shape and size (a block with a hole, a single pixel, a solid rectangle).
3.  **Output Object:** The output grid also contains a single object derived from the input object.
4.  **Color Preservation:** The non-zero digit (color) of the object remains the same from input to output.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves expanding the bounding box of the input object and potentially creating a hole within the expanded object.
6.  **Bounding Box Expansion:** The bounding box of the non-zero object in the input seems to determine the structure of the output. The output object occupies a bounding box that is one unit larger in height and width than the input object's bounding box, specifically by expanding one unit up and one unit to the left from the input's top-left corner while keeping the bottom-right corner the same.
7.  **Hole Creation:** If the input object's bounding box has both height and width greater than 1, a hole is created in the output object. This hole seems to occupy the region corresponding to the input object's bounding box, excluding its last row and last column. If the input object is only 1 pixel high or 1 pixel wide, no hole is created.

## YAML Facts Documentation


```yaml
Task: Transform a grid based on a single non-zero object.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: A 2D array of integers.
  - Background_Value: 0.
  - Object:
    - Type: A single connected component of non-zero pixels.
    - Properties:
      - Color: The integer value (C) of the non-zero pixels.
      - Bounding_Box:
        - Top_Row: r1 (min row index)
        - Left_Col: c1 (min col index)
        - Bottom_Row: r2 (max row index)
        - Right_Col: c2 (max col index)
      - Dimensions:
        - Height: H = r2 - r1 + 1
        - Width: W = c2 - c1 + 1

Output_Features:
  - Grid: A 2D array of integers, same dimensions as input.
  - Transformed_Object:
    - Based on the Input_Object.
    - Color: Same as Input_Object Color (C).
    - Bounding_Box:
        - Top_Row: r1 - 1 (clipped to 0)
        - Left_Col: c1 - 1 (clipped to 0)
        - Bottom_Row: r2
        - Right_Col: c2
    - Shape: Generally a filled rectangle defined by the output bounding box, potentially with a hole.
    - Hole:
      - Condition: Exists if Input_Object Height (H) > 1 AND Input_Object Width (W) > 1.
      - Location: Occupies the region defined by rows r1 to r2-1 and columns c1 to c2-1 within the output grid.
      - Value: Pixels within the hole are set to the Background_Value (0).

Relationships:
  - Output_Object.Color == Input_Object.Color
  - Output_Object.Bounding_Box is derived from Input_Object.Bounding_Box (shifted up-left, same bottom-right).
  - Output_Object.Hole depends on Input_Object.Dimensions (H, W) and Input_Object.Bounding_Box (r1, c1, r2, c2).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the connected group of non-zero pixels in the input grid. If no such group exists, return the input grid unchanged.
2.  Determine the color `C` of this group.
3.  Find the bounding box of the group: the minimum row `r1`, maximum row `r2`, minimum column `c1`, and maximum column `c2`.
4.  Calculate the height `H = r2 - r1 + 1` and width `W = c2 - c1 + 1`.
5.  Create a new output grid of the same size as the input, initialized with zeros.
6.  Define the coordinates for the main body of the output shape: rows from `r1 - 1` to `r2`, and columns from `c1 - 1` to `c2`. Ensure coordinates stay within the grid boundaries (e.g., row and column indices cannot be less than 0).
7.  Fill the cells within these output coordinates in the new grid with the color `C`.
8.  Check if the input object's dimensions satisfy `H > 1` and `W > 1`.
9.  If the condition in step 8 is true, define the coordinates for a "hole": rows from `r1` to `r2 - 1`, and columns from `c1` to `c2 - 1`.
10. Set the cells within these hole coordinates in the new grid back to 0.
11. Return the new grid.
