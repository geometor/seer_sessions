Task: Transform a grid based on a single non-zero object.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: A 2D array of integers.
  - Background_Value: 0.
  - Object:
    - Type: A single connected component of non-zero pixels.
    - Properties:
      - Color: The integer value (C) of the non-zero pixels.
      - Bounding_Box:
        - Top_Row: r1 (min row index)
        - Left_Col: c1 (min col index)
        - Bottom_Row: r2 (max row index)
        - Right_Col: c2 (max col index)
      - Dimensions:
        - Height: H = r2 - r1 + 1
        - Width: W = c2 - c1 + 1

Output_Features:
  - Grid: A 2D array of integers, same dimensions as input.
  - Transformed_Object:
    - Based on the Input_Object.
    - Color: Same as Input_Object Color (C).
    - Bounding_Box:
        - Top_Row: r1 - 1 (clipped to 0)
        - Left_Col: c1 - 1 (clipped to 0)
        - Bottom_Row: r2
        - Right_Col: c2
    - Shape: Generally a filled rectangle defined by the output bounding box, potentially with a hole.
    - Hole:
      - Condition: Exists if Input_Object Height (H) > 1 AND Input_Object Width (W) > 1.
      - Location: Occupies the region defined by rows r1 to r2-1 and columns c1 to c2-1 within the output grid.
      - Value: Pixels within the hole are set to the Background_Value (0).

Relationships:
  - Output_Object.Color == Input_Object.Color
  - Output_Object.Bounding_Box is derived from Input_Object.Bounding_Box (shifted up-left, same bottom-right).
  - Output_Object.Hole depends on Input_Object.Dimensions (H, W) and Input_Object.Bounding_Box (r1, c1, r2, c2).
