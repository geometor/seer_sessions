Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) of integers. The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical in each example.
2.  **Grid Values:** The input grids contain only the values 0 and 3. The output grids contain the values 0, 3, and 7.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to operate on the cells containing the value '3'. Cells with '0' remain unchanged. Some '3' cells remain '3', while others are changed to '7'.
4.  **Pattern Identification:** The '3' cells form contiguous rectangular or near-rectangular blocks. The cells that change from '3' to '7' seem to be located at the "corners" of these blocks. Specifically, they correspond to the minimum/maximum row and column indices within each distinct block of '3's.

**YAML Facts:**

task_elements:
  - type: grid
    role: input
    value_type: integer
    observed_values: [0, 3]
    properties:
      - fixed_dimensions_across_examples: True # within a single example pair, input/output dims match
  - type: grid
    role: output
    value_type: integer
    observed_values: [0, 3, 7]
    properties:
      - fixed_dimensions_across_examples: True

transformation_details:
  - element: cell_value_0
    input_value: 0
    output_value: 0
    action: unchanged
  - element: cell_value_3
    input_value: 3
    output_value: either 3 or 7
    action: conditional_change
    condition: depends on position within a contiguous block of '3's

objects:
  - object: grid
    description: Represents the overall input and output structure.
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - value (integer: 0, 3, or 7)
      - position (row, column)
  - object: block_of_3s
    description: A contiguous group of cells with the value 3. Adjacency is typically defined horizontally and vertically.
    properties:
      - cells (list of cell positions)
      - bounding_box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col)
      - corners (specific cells within the block at the extrema of the bounding box)

actions:
  - action: identify_blocks
    target: grid
    input_value: 3
    output: list of block_of_3s
  - action: find_block_corners
    target: block_of_3s
    result: identify cells within the block located at (min_row, min_col), (min_row, max_col), (max_row, min_col), (max_row, max_col) of the block's bounding box.
  - action: update_cell_value
    target: cell
    condition: If a cell is identified as a corner of a block_of_3s.
    new_value: 7

relationships:
  - A cell is part of a block_of_3s if its value is 3 and it is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to another cell in the same block.
  - A cell is a corner_of_a_block if its value is 3 and its position matches one of the four corner positions of the bounding box for the block it belongs to.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Find all distinct contiguous blocks of cells containing the value '3' in the input grid. Consider cells adjacent horizontally or vertically as belonging to the same block.
3.  For each identified block of '3's:
    a.  Determine the minimum row index (`min_r`), maximum row index (`max_r`), minimum column index (`min_c`), and maximum column index (`max_c`) occupied by the cells within this specific block.
    b.  Check if the cells at the four corner positions defined by these indices (`(min_r, min_c)`, `(min_r, max_c)`, `(max_r, min_c)`, `(max_r, max_c)`) actually exist within the current block (i.e., contain the value '3').
    c.  For each of these corner positions that contains a '3' (and is thus part of the block), update the value of the corresponding cell in the output grid to '7'.
4.  Return the final output grid.
