Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are represented as 2D grids (matrices) of numbers.
2.  **Color Palette:** The grids use a limited set of numbers, which likely represent colors:
    *   `0`: Appears to be the background color (black).
    *   `3`: A primary color involved in the input patterns (blue).
    *   `1`: Another color present in some input patterns (red).
    *   `4`: Another color present in some input patterns (yellow).
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** Comparing input and output grids reveals a consistent change: cells with values `1` or `4` in the input grid are replaced with `0` in the output grid. Cells with values `0` or `3` remain unchanged.
4.  **No Spatial Rearrangement:** The positions of the `3`s and `0`s are preserved between input and output. The only change is the conversion of `1`s and `4`s to `0`s.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - representation: 2D matrix
      - cell_values: integers (0, 1, 3, 4)
      - value_interpretation: colors (0: background/black, 1: red, 3: blue, 4: yellow)
objects:
  - name: color_1_cell
    identifier: cell value is 1
  - name: color_4_cell
    identifier: cell value is 4
  - name: color_3_cell
    identifier: cell value is 3
  - name: background_cell
    identifier: cell value is 0
actions:
  - name: replace_color
    target: color_1_cell
    new_value: 0
  - name: replace_color
    target: color_4_cell
    new_value: 0
  - name: preserve_color
    target: color_3_cell
  - name: preserve_color
    target: background_cell
relationships:
  - input_grid and output_grid have the same dimensions.
  - The position of each cell is maintained from input to output.
transformation_rule:
  - For each cell in the input grid:
    - If the cell value is 1 or 4, the corresponding output cell value becomes 0.
    - Otherwise, the corresponding output cell value is the same as the input cell value.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (row by row, column by column) of the input grid.
3.  For the current cell, check its value (color).
4.  If the value is `1` or `4`, set the value of the corresponding cell in the new grid to `0`.
5.  If the value is not `1` or `4` (meaning it's `0` or `3`), copy the value from the input cell to the corresponding cell in the new grid.
6.  The final new grid is the output.
