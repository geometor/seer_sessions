            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on 5x5 grids containing integer values.\n2.  **Colors/Values:** The integer 0 acts as a background color. Non-zero integers represent distinct foreground \"objects\" or \"colors\".\n3.  **Objects:** In each input example, there are exactly two distinct non-zero colors. These colors form potentially irregular, connected shapes within the input grid.\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The transformation aims to separate these two objects and represent them as solid rectangles in the output grid.\n5.  **Output Structure:** The output grid maintains the original dimensions. The two original non-zero colors are present, but they now form solid rectangular blocks, positioned at diagonally opposite corners or edges of the grid. The size of each rectangle corresponds to the extent (bounding box) of the original shape in the input.\n6.  **Key Properties:** The crucial properties for the transformation are the identity of the two colors, the set of cells occupied by each color, their bounding boxes (minimum/maximum row/column), the dimensions (height/width) of these bounding boxes, and their relative spatial positions (which can be determined by comparing centroids).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

List all grid coordinates (row, column) containing the color.\n    b.  Calculate the centroid (average row, average column) of these coordinates.\n    c.  Determine the bounding box (min/max row and column) enclosing these coordinates.\n    d.  Calculate the height and width of this bounding box.\n4.  **Relative Positioning:** Compare the centroids of Color A and Color B to determine which color is relatively higher (smaller average row) and which is relatively lefter (smaller average column).\n5.  **Corner Assignment:**\n    *   Assign the color that is higher and lefter to the TopLeft corner.\n    *   Assign the color that is higher and righter to the TopRight corner.\n    *   Assign the color that is lower and lefter to the BottomLeft corner.\n    *   Assign the color that is lower and righter to the BottomRight corner.\n    *   The remaining color is assigned to the diagonally opposite corner.\n6.  **Output Generation:**\n    a.  For the color assigned to TopLeft (Color X, Height H, Width W): Fill the rectangle in the output grid from (row 0, col 0) to (row H-1, col W-1) with Color X.\n    b.  For the color assigned to TopRight (Color X, Height H, Width W): Fill the rectangle from (row 0, col 5-W) to (row H-1, col 4) with Color X.\n    c.  For the color assigned to BottomLeft (Color X, Height H, Width W): Fill the rectangle from (row 5-H, col 0) to (row 4, col W-1) with Color X.\n    d.  For the color assigned to BottomRight (Color X, Height H, Width W): Fill the rectangle from (row 5-H, col 5-W) to (row 4, col 4) with Color X.\n    e.  Perform the corresponding fill operation for the second color in its assigned opposite corner, using its specific height and width.\n7.  **Finalize:** Return the completed output grid."
