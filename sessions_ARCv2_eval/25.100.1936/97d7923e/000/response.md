Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) containing non-negative integers. The dimensions (rows and columns) of the grid remain unchanged.
2.  **Values:** The grids contain mostly zeros, with some non-zero digits scattered throughout.
3.  **Transformation Scope:** Changes seem localized within individual columns. One column's transformation doesn't appear to affect other columns directly.
4.  **Nature of Change:** Specific non-zero values within a column are being replaced by another non-zero value from the same column. Zeros remain zeros.
5.  **Trigger Condition:** The change seems triggered by the *minimum* non-zero value present in a column.
6.  **Positional Dependence:** The change applies only to cells *below* the first occurrence of this minimum non-zero value within the column. Values above or at the same row as the first minimum non-zero value are unaffected.
7.  **Target Value:** The non-zero values below the trigger row are changed *to* the minimum non-zero value identified for that column.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation by Column Propagation

Objects:
  - Grid:
      Properties:
        - rows: Integer (number of rows)
        - columns: Integer (number of columns)
        - cells: List of Lists (holding cell values)
  - Column:
      Properties:
        - index: Integer
        - values: List of Integers (values in that column)
      Derived Properties:
        - non_zero_values: List of Integers
        - min_non_zero_value: Integer (smallest value > 0 in the column, if any)
        - first_min_row_index: Integer (row index of the first occurrence of min_non_zero_value, if any)
  - Cell:
      Properties:
        - row: Integer
        - column: Integer
        - value: Integer

Relationships:
  - A Grid contains multiple Columns and Cells.
  - A Column contains multiple Cells (one per row).
  - A transformation rule is applied independently to each Column.

Actions:
  - Iterate through each Column of the input Grid.
  - Identify non-zero values within the current Column.
  - If multiple non-zero values exist:
      - Find the minimum non-zero value (`min_val`) for the Column.
      - Find the row index (`trigger_row`) of the first occurrence of `min_val`.
      - Iterate through rows below `trigger_row`.
      - Modify Cell values: For cells in the current Column below `trigger_row`, if their value is non-zero, change it to `min_val`.
  - Copy unchanged Cell values to the output Grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Process the grid column by column, from left to right.
3.  For each column:
    a.  Identify all non-zero values present in that column and note their row indices.
    b.  If there are fewer than two non-zero values in the column, copy the entire column from the input to the output grid and proceed to the next column.
    c.  If there are two or more non-zero values:
        i.  Find the minimum value among the non-zero values identified in step 3a. Call this `min_val`.
        ii. Find the lowest row index where `min_val` appears in this column. Call this `trigger_row`.
        iii. Copy the values from the input column to the output column for all rows up to and including `trigger_row`.
        iv. For each row *below* `trigger_row`:
            1. Check the value in the input grid at this row and the current column.
            2. If the value is non-zero, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to `min_val`.
            3. If the value is zero, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to zero.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
