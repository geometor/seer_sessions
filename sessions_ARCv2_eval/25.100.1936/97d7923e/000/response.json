The dimensions (rows and columns) of the grid remain unchanged.\n2.  **Values:** The grids contain mostly zeros, with some non-zero digits scattered throughout.\n3.  **Transformation Scope:** Changes seem localized within individual columns. One column's transformation doesn't appear to affect other columns directly.\n4.  **Nature of Change:** Specific non-zero values within a column are being replaced by another non-zero value from the same column. Zeros remain zeros.\n5.  **Trigger Condition:** The change seems triggered by the *minimum* non-zero value present in a column.\n6.  **Positional Dependence:** The change applies only to cells *below* the first occurrence of this minimum non-zero value within the column. Values above or at the same row as the first minimum non-zero value are unaffected.\n7.  **Target Value:** The non-zero values below the trigger row are changed *to* the minimum non-zero value identified for that column.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
