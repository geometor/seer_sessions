The input grid (R rows x 15 columns) is split by the central column (index 7, containing '4's) into a Left half (L, columns 0-6) and a Right half (R, columns 8-14), each R rows x 7 columns.\n2.  Identify the unique color ('5' in examples) present only in the Right half (R). Find the row index `r5` where this color '5' occurs.\n3.  Initialize an empty output grid (O) of size R rows x 7 columns with zeros.\n4.  Copy the entire row `r5` from the Right half (R) into the corresponding row `r5` of the output grid (O).\n5.  Identify all distinct shapes (connected components of the same non-zero color) within the Left half (L).\n6.  For each shape found in L:\n    a. Check if any cell belonging to this shape exists in row `r5`.\n    b. If the shape does *not* intersect with row `r5`, copy all cells of this shape (preserving their color and relative row/column positions) into the output grid (O). If multiple shapes are copied to the same cell, the one processed later (based on shape sorting, e.g., by color then position) will overwrite previous ones.\n7.  Return the final output grid (O).\n\nNote: This hypothesis is based on observations but failed to perfectly replicate the training examples during analysis. It represents a structured attempt to capture the relationship between the halves and the unique element '5'. Further refinement is likely needed.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Helper function to find connected components (shapes)\ndef find_shapes(grid_half):\n    \"\"\"Finds connected components of the same non-zero color in a grid half.\n\n    Args:\n        grid_half: A list of lists representing one half of the grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a shape\n        and has keys 'color' (int) and 'coords' (list of (row, col) tuples).\n        Shapes are sorted by color, then by top-most, then left-most coordinate.\n    \"\"\"\n    grid = np.array(grid_half)\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    shapes_data = defaultdict(list) # color -> list of shapes, each shape is a list of coords\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Found a non-zero cell that hasn't been visited yet - start of a new shape\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and not visited[r, c]:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                current_shape_coords = []\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                min_r, min_c = r, c # Track top-left for sorting\n\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    current_shape_coords.append((row, col))\n                    min_r = min(min_r, row)\n                    min_c = min(min_c, col)\n\n\n                    # Check neighbors (4-connectivity: up, down, left, right)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        # Check bounds, if neighbor has same color, and not visited\n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                           not visited[nr, nc] and grid[nr, nc] == color:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                \n                # Store the found shape with its color and sorting info\n                shapes_data[color].append({'coords': current_shape_coords, 'min_r': min_r, 'min_c': min_c})\n\n    # Flatten the dictionary into a list and sort\n    all_shapes = []\n    for color in sorted(shapes_data.keys()): # Sort primarily by color\n        # Sort shapes of the same color by top-left coordinate\n        sorted_color_shapes = sorted(shapes_data[color], key=lambda s: (s['min_r'], s['min_c']))\n        for shape_info in sorted_color_shapes:\n             all_shapes.append({'color': color, 'coords': shape_info['coords']})\n\n    return all_shapes\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the hypothesized transformation rule (v4) to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    rows, cols = input_np.shape\n\n    # Ensure the grid has the expected 15 columns structure\n    if cols != 15:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input grid must have 15 columns\")\n\n    # 1.
