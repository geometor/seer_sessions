*   Comparison:
    *   `train_1`: Input L=40, R=10. Output=22.
    *   `train_2`: Input L=22, R=3. Output=12.
    *   `train_3`: Input L=31, R=5. Output=14.

    No obvious relationship based on counts alone (like sum, difference, min, max).

*   Let's reconsider the unique value '5' in the right half. What if the output grid is constructed based on the *pattern* containing the '5'?
    *   In all examples, '5' is a single cell in the top row of the right half.
    *   Look at `train_1`: Output row 0 is `0 5 0 0 0 0 0`. This matches the right half.
    *   Look at `train_2`: Output row 0 is `0 0 0 5 0 0 0`. Matches the right half.
    *   Look at `train_3`: Output row 0 is `0 0 0 0 5 0 0`. Matches the right half.
    *   It seems the output *is* selecting either the left or right half for each row.
    *   Why did my previous check fail? Let's re-test hypothesis: "For each row, select the half (L or R) which contains the 'target' color (5). If neither contains 5, select the 'other' half." This seems flawed logic.

*   New Hypothesis: "Select the half (left or right) that contains the globally least frequent non-zero color overall. If a row contains this color in the selected half, output that half for the row. Otherwise, output the other half for that row."
    *   `train_1`: Colors L={1,2,3,6}, R={5,6}. Counts: 1(8), 2(7), 3(7), 5(1), 6(11+4=15). Least frequent is '5'. It's in R. So, target half = R.
        *   Row 0: R has '5'. Output R `0500000`. Correct.
        *   Row 1: R has no '5'. Output L `2020060`. Actual `2200000`. Incorrect.
*   What if the selection criterion is based on the *row itself*?
    *   Hypothesis: For each row, compare the left half (L) and right half (R). Select the half that is "more unique" or "more salient". How to define this?
        *   Maybe the half containing the color that is *least frequent* within that specific row?
        *   Row 0 `train_1`: L=`2020606` (Colors {2,6}), R=`0500000` (Color {5}). '5' is globally rare. Select R. Output R.
        *   Row 1 `train_1`: L=`2020060` (Colors {2,6}), R=`0000000` (Color {}). Select L? Output L. Actual `2200000`. Input L is `2020060`. Still doesn't match.

*   Let's reconsider the unique color '5' again. It's always in the right half.
    *   Maybe the operation involves **overlaying** or **combining** parts?
    *   Look at `train_1` again.
        Input L | Input R | Output
        ------- | ------- | ------
        `2020606` | `0500000` | `0500000` (R)
        `2020060` | `0000000` | `2200000` (?)
        `2220060` | `0000000` | `1110000` (?)
        `0000000` | `0000000` | `0011100` (?)
        `1100333` | `0000000` | `0000600` (?)
        ...
    *   Rows 1, 2, 3, 4 outputs seem unrelated to simple selection. This suggests a more complex object-based transformation or a flaw in my parsing of the grid data. Let me re-check `train_1` input/output copy-paste. Seems okay.

*   Could it be selecting based on a shape property?
    *   E.g., Find the shape made of '5'. Select the half containing it. For every other shape in the input, if it's in the selected half, ignore it. If it's in the *other* half, copy it to the output grid?
    *   `train_1`: '5' is in R. Target half=R.
        *   Shapes in L: `2` (rows 0-2), `2` (rows 0-1), `6` (rows 0-2), `1` (rows 4-6), `3` (rows 4-6), `1` (rows 8-10), `6` (rows 8-10), `6` (rows 12-14), `1` (rows 12-14).
        *   Shapes in R: `5` (row 0), `6` (rows 8-10), `1` (rows 12-14).
        *   Rule: Keep '5' from R. Keep shapes from L.
        *   Output should contain: `5` (from R, row 0), `2` (from L, rows 0-2), `2` (from L, rows 0-1), `6` (from L, rows 0-2), `1` (from L, rows 4-6), `3` (from L, rows 4-6), `1` (from L, rows 8-10), `6` (from L, rows 8-10), `6` (from L, rows 12-14), `1` (from L, rows 12-14).
        *   Let's try to reconstruct the output based on this:
            *   Row 0: Contains '5' from R. Contains `2`, `2`, `6` from L. Combined? Output `0500000`. Only '5' kept.
            *   Row 1: Contains `2`, `2`, `6` from L. Output `2200000`. Where does this specific pattern come from? Looks like the `2` shape at (1,0) and (2,0) from the L input `[[2,0,2],[2,0,2],[2,2,2]]`.
            *   Row 2: Contains `2`, `6` from L. Output `1110000`. Where does the `1` come from?
    *   This is still not working.

*   Let's assume the task is simpler. **Find the single object that is unique between the left and right halves.**
    *   Unique object definition: Based on color? The color '5' is unique to the right half in all examples.
    *   The task is likely: **Extract the 7xR grid from the half (left or right) that contains the unique color '5'.**
    *   Why did this fail before? Let's re-check `train_1`.
        *   Input Right Half (cols 8-14):

    *   They are clearly different. My hypothesis about simply selecting the half containing '5' is wrong.

*   Is there a mistake in the problem description or my interpretation?
    *   Input grid -> Output grid.
    *   Sizes: R x 15 -> R x 7.
    *   Separator column 7 ('4').

*   Maybe the '4' column isn't just a separator, but provides information? It's always all '4's (or maybe not, let's check).
    *   `train_1`: Col 7 is all '4'.
    *   `train_2`: Col 7 is all '4'.
    *   `train_3`: Col 7 is all '4'.
    *   Okay, so the column itself is constant.

*   Could the transformation involve rotating or reflecting one of the halves?
    *   Take the Right half (containing '5'). Rotate/reflect it? Doesn't seem likely.

*   Let's focus on `train_2` (smaller).

    *   Row 1 Output `0001110`. Input L `1010202`. Input R `0000000`. Where does `111` come from? It looks like the `1` shape from input L (rows 0,1 col 0-2) `[[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]` somehow maps here? But shifted to cols 3-5.
    *   Row 2 Output `0000060`. Input L `0100222`. Input R `0000000`. Where does `6` come from? Row 5 L has `6`. Row 6 L has `6`.
    *   Row 4 Output `0000220`. Input R `0000220`. Matches Input R.
    *   Row 5 Output `0333300`. Input L `0600030`. Input R `0000000`. Matches the `3` shape from Input L rows 4-6? `[[3,3,3],[0,3,0],[3,0,3]]` shifted maybe?

*   **Revised Hypothesis:**
    1.  Divide the input grid into Left (cols 0-6) and Right (cols 8-14) halves.
    2.  Identify the digit ('color') that appears in only one half across the entire grid. In the examples, this is '5' and it's always in the Right half. Let this be the 'target color' and the half it resides in be the 'target half' (Right). The other half is the 'source half' (Left).
    3.  Create an output grid of the same number of rows as the input and 7 columns, initially empty (all zeros).
    4.  Copy the 'target color' pattern from the 'target half' of the input to the output grid, maintaining its row/column position within the 7-column frame. (e.g., copy the '5' at R:(0, 3) [relative index] to Output:(0, 3)).
    5.  Iterate through all *other* distinct non-zero colors present in the 'source half' of the input grid.
    6.  For each such color, find its bounding box *in the source half*.
    7.  Find the *relative position* of this bounding box within the 7xR source half grid.
    8.  Copy the pattern of this color from the source half to the output grid, placing it at the *same relative position*. Overwrite any existing pixels in the output grid. (The order of copying might matter if shapes overlap in the output space). Let's assume colors are processed in numerical order (1, 2, 3, 6...).
    *   Let's test this on `train_2`:
        *   Target color: 5. Target half: R. Source half: L.
        *   Initialize Output (7x7) with zeros.
        *   Step 4: Copy '5' from R. Input R has '5' at row 0, col 3 (relative). Output[0, 3] = 5.

        *   Step 5: Colors in Source half (L) are {1, 2, 3, 6}.
        *   Step 6/7/8: Process color 1:
            *   Shape '1' in L is `[[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]` at L:(0:1, 0:2).

Rows 0-2, Cols 0-6. The pattern is complex. Let's use the simple `[[2,2,2]]` from row 2, cols 4-6. Position L:(2, 4:6).
            *   Copy `2 2 2` to Output at (2, 4:6).

        *   This reconstructed output does not match the actual output `train_2`.

10. **Backtrack again. Simpler.** What if the output IS one of the halves, but the *choice* depends on something global?
    *   Hypothesis: If the number of non-zero cells in the Left half > Right half, output Left half. Otherwise, output Right half.
        *   `train_1`: L=40, R=10. L > R. Output should be Left Half.
            Input Left Half:
            
```
            2 0 2 0 6 0 6
            2 0 2 0 0 6 0
            2 2 2 0 0 6 0
            0 0 0 0 0 0 0

            0 6 0 0 0 1 0
            ```

            Actual Output `train_1`: (See above) - Clearly different. Hypothesis failed.
    *   Hypothesis: If the number of unique colors in Left half > Right half, output Left half. Otherwise Right half.
        *   `train_1`: Unique L={1,2,3}. Unique R={5}. |L|=3, |R|=1. L > R. Output Left. Failed.
        *   `train_2`: Unique L={1,3,6}. Unique R={5}. |L|=3, |R|=1. L > R. Output Left.
            Input Left Half:

            Actual Output `train_2`: (See above) - Clearly different. Failed.
        *   `train_3`: Unique L={1,2}. Unique R={5}. |L|=2, |R|=1. L > R. Output Left. Failed.

*   This task is surprisingly tricky. The output seems related to the input halves, but not a direct copy or simple selection. The presence of the unique color '5' in the right half seems key.
*   Maybe the operation is: Identify the target half (Right, containing '5'). The output grid is primarily the *other* half (Left), but modified by elements from the target half?
*   Let's try: Output = Left Half, BUT, overwrite the cells corresponding to the position of the '5' in the Right half with '5'.
    *   `train_1`: Output = Left Half. '5' is at R:(0,1). Output[0,1] = 5.
        *   Output row 0: L=`2020606`. Set O[0,1]=5 -> `2 5 2 0 6 0 6`. Actual output `0 5 0 0 0 0 0`. No.
*   Maybe Output = Left Half, BUT, any row in L that has a corresponding non-zero entry *anywhere* in R gets zeroed out, *except* for the row containing '5'? No, too complex.

*   **Final attempt at a simple rule:**
    1. Identify the half (L/R) containing the globally unique color '5'. This is the 'target half' (R). The other is 'source half' (L).
    2. The output grid is the source half (L).
    3. Find the row index `r` where the color '5' exists in the target half (R).
    4. Replace the output grid's row `r` with the target half's (R) row `r`.
    *   Test `train_1`: Target=R, Source=L. '5' is in row 0 of R.
        *   Output = Input L.
        *   Replace Output row 0 with Input R row 0 (`0 5 0 0 0 0 0`).
        *   Resulting Output:
            
```
            0 5 0 0 0 0 0  <- From R row 0
            2 0 2 0 0 6 0  <- From L row 1
            2 2 2 0 0 6 0  <- From L row 2

            ```

        *   Compare to Actual Output `train_1`. It matches row 0, but rows 1-14 are completely different.

    *   Test `train_2`: Target=R, Source=L. '5' is in row 0 of R.
        *   Output = Input L.
        *   Replace Output row 0 with Input R row 0 (`0 0 0 5 0 0 0`).
        *   Resulting Output:
            
```

            1 0 1 0 2 0 2 <- From L row 1

            ```

        * Compare to Actual Output `train_2`. Matches row 0, but differs elsewhere.

*   **Okay, the core assumption might be wrong.** It's not just selecting L or R based on '5'. Let's look at the structure *within* the output grids. They often contain single-color shapes.
*   What if we identify *all* shapes in the input (L and R), find the shape containing '5', and then *only* keep shapes from the *other* half?
    *   `train_1`: Shape '5' is in R. Keep shapes from L.
        *   Shapes in L: `2` (rows 0-2), `2` (rows 0-1), `6` (rows 0-2), `1` (rows 4-6), `3` (rows 4-6), `1` (rows 8-10), `6` (rows 8-10), `6` (rows 12-14), `1` (rows 12-14).
        *   Construct output using only these shapes placed at their original relative L positions.
            *   Row 0: `2 0 2 0 6 0 6`
            *   Row 1: `2 0 2 0 0 6 0`
            *   Row 2: `2 2 2 0 0 6 0`
            *   Row 3: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0`
            *   Row 4: `1 1 0 0 3 3 3`
            ... This is just the Left Half again. Still doesn't match.

*   **Final thought process: What if the output grid is *always* the LEFT half, except for the single cell containing the '5' (which comes from the right half)?**
    1. Result grid = Left half of input grid.
    2. Find the coordinates (r, c_rel) of '5' within the Right half (where c_rel is 0-6).
    3. Set Result[r, c_rel] = 5. (This might overwrite an existing value from the Left half).
    *   Test `train_1`:
        *   Result = Left Half.
        *   '5' is at R:(0, 1).
        *   Set Result[0, 1] = 5.
        *   Result[0,:] was `2 0 2 0 6 0 6`. Becomes `2 5 2 0 6 0 6`.
        *   This still doesn't match the actual output `0 5 0 0 0 0 0`.

This task definition seems ambiguous or requires a non-obvious step. The most consistent observation is the split by column 7 ('4') and the unique presence of '5' in the right half. The output seems to *prioritize* showing the '5' from the right half in its correct row, and then fills the *rest* of the grid based on *something* from the left half, but not a direct copy. Perhaps it keeps only the *largest* or *most salient* object from the left half?

Let's assume the "keep only shapes from the non-'5' half" idea, but maybe the shapes are simplified or only the dominant color is kept?

Okay, let's describe the process based on the most plausible, though incomplete, hypothesis: The grid is split, a unique element '5' identifies the right half, and the output is constructed primarily from the left half, with the '5' element replacing whatever was in its position. This doesn't fully explain the examples, but captures the core structure.

**Revised Natural Language Program Idea:**

1.  Divide the R x 15 input grid into a Left R x 7 grid (cols 0-6) and a Right R x 7 grid (cols 8-14), ignoring the separator column 7.
2.  Identify the single digit value (which is '5' in all examples) that exists *only* within the Right grid across all its cells.
3.  Find the location (row `r`, column `c`) of this unique digit '5' within the Right grid.
4.  The output grid is initially a copy of the Left grid.
5.  Set the cell in the output grid at row `r`, column `c` to '5'.

Let's try `train_1` with this.
1. Left Grid, Right Grid identified. '5' is unique to Right.
2. '5' is at Right grid coords (r=0, c=1).
3. Output = Left grid initially.
4. Set Output[0, 1] = 5.
   Output row 0 was `2 0 2 0 6 0 6`. Becomes `2 5 2 0 6 0 6`.
This *still* doesn't match the first row `0 5 0 0 0 0 0`.

What if step 4 is: Output grid = Left grid. Step 5: Set the *entire row* `r` of the output grid equal to the *entire row* `r` of the Right grid? (This was Hypothesis tested and failed above).

Let's reconsider the uniqueness check. Is '5' always the *only* unique digit?
*   `train_1`: L unique {1, 2, 3}, R unique {5}. Yes, '5' is the only unique in R.
*   `train_2`: L unique {1, 3, 6}, R unique {5}. Yes, '5' is the only unique in R.
*   `train_3`: L unique {1, 2}, R unique {5}. Yes, '5' is the only unique in R
