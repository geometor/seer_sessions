If a row contains this color in the selected half, output that half for the row. Otherwise, output the other half for that row.\"\n    *   `train_1`: Colors L={1,2,3,6}, R={5,6}.

For every other shape in the input, if it's in the selected half, ignore it. If it's in the *other* half, copy it to the output grid?\n    *   `train_1`: '5' is in R.

Keep shapes from L.\n        *   Output should contain: `5` (from R, row 0), `2` (from L, rows 0-2), `2` (from L, rows 0-1), `6` (from L, rows 0-2), `1` (from L, rows 4-6), `3` (from L, rows 4-6), `1` (from L, rows 8-10), `6` (from L, rows 8-10), `6` (from L, rows 12-14), `1` (from L, rows 12-14).\n        *   Let's try to reconstruct the output based on this:\n            *   Row 0: Contains '5' from R. Contains `2`, `2`, `6` from L. Combined? Output `0500000`. Only '5' kept.\n            *   Row 1: Contains `2`, `2`, `6` from L. Output `2200000`. Where does this specific pattern come from? Looks like the `2` shape at (1,0) and (2,0) from the L input `[[2,0,2],[2,0,2],[2,2,2]]`.\n            *   Row 2: Contains `2`, `6` from L. Output `1110000`. Where does the `1` come from?\n    *   This is still not working.\n\n*   Let's assume the task is simpler. **Find the single object that is unique between the left and right halves.**\n    *   Unique object definition: Based on color? The color '5' is unique to the right half in all examples.\n    *   The task is likely: **Extract the 7xR grid from the half (left or right) that contains the unique color '5'.**\n    *   Why did this fail before?

They often contain single-color shapes.\n*   What if we identify *all* shapes in the input (L and R), find the shape containing '5', and then *only* keep shapes from the *other* half?\n    *   `train_1`: Shape '5' is in R.

This is just the Left Half again. Still doesn't match.\n\n*   **Final thought process: What if the output grid is *always* the LEFT half, except for the single cell containing the '5' (which comes from the right half)?**\n    1. Result grid = Left half of input grid.\n    2. Find the coordinates (r, c_rel) of '5' within the Right half (where c_rel is 0-6).\n    3. Set Result[r, c_rel] = 5. (This might overwrite an existing value from the Left half).\n    *   Test `train_1`:\n        *   Result = Left Half.\n        *   '5' is at R:(0, 1).\n        *   Set Result[0, 1] = 5.\n        *   Result[0,:] was `2 0 2 0 6 0 6`. Becomes `2 5 2 0 6 0 6`.\n        *   This still doesn't match the actual output `0 5 0 0 0 0 0`.\n\nThis task definition seems ambiguous or requires a non-obvious step. The most consistent observation is the split by column 7 ('4') and the unique presence of '5' in the right half. The output seems to *prioritize* showing the '5' from the right half in its correct row, and then fills the *rest* of the grid based on *something* from the left half, but not a direct copy. Perhaps it keeps only the *largest* or *most salient* object from the left half?\n\nLet's assume the \"keep only shapes from the non-'5' half\" idea, but maybe the shapes are simplified or only the dominant color is kept?\n\nOkay, let's describe the process based on the most plausible, though incomplete, hypothesis: The grid is split, a unique element '5' identifies the right half, and the output is constructed primarily from the left half, with the '5' element replacing whatever was in its position. This doesn't fully explain the examples, but captures the core structure.\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program Idea:**\n\n1.  Divide the R x 15 input grid into a Left R x 7 grid (cols 0-6) and a Right R x 7 grid (cols 8-14), ignoring the separator column 7.\n2.  Identify the single digit value (which is '5' in all examples) that exists *only* within the Right grid across all its cells.\n3.  Find the location (row `r`, column `c`) of this unique digit '5' within the Right grid.\n4.  The output grid is initially a copy of the Left grid.\n5.  Set the cell in the output grid at row `r`, column `c` to '5'.\n\nLet's try `train_1` with this.\n1. Left Grid, Right Grid identified. '5' is unique to Right.\n2. '5' is at Right grid coords (r=0, c=1).\n3. Output = Left grid initially.\n4. Set Output[0, 1] = 5.\n   Output row 0 was `2 0 2 0 6 0 6`. Becomes `2 5 2 0 6 0 6`.\nThis *still* doesn't match the first row `0 5 0 0 0 0 0`.\n\nWhat if step 4 is: Output grid = Left grid. Step 5: Set the *entire row* `r` of the output grid equal to the *entire row* `r` of the Right grid? (This was Hypothesis tested and failed above).\n\nLet's reconsider the uniqueness check. Is '5' always the *only* unique digit?\n*   `train_1`: L unique {1, 2, 3}, R unique {5}. Yes, '5' is the only unique in R.\n*   `train_2`: L unique {1, 3, 6}, R unique {5}. Yes, '5' is the only unique in R.\n*   `train_3`: L unique {1, 2}, R unique {5}. Yes, '5' is the only unique in R"
