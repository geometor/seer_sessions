Transformation Rule Hypothesis (v4):

1.  The input grid (R rows x 15 columns) is split by the central column (index 7, containing '4's) into a Left half (L, columns 0-6) and a Right half (R, columns 8-14), each R rows x 7 columns.
2.  Identify the unique color ('5' in examples) present only in the Right half (R). Find the row index `r5` where this color '5' occurs.
3.  Initialize an empty output grid (O) of size R rows x 7 columns with zeros.
4.  Copy the entire row `r5` from the Right half (R) into the corresponding row `r5` of the output grid (O).
5.  Identify all distinct shapes (connected components of the same non-zero color) within the Left half (L).
6.  For each shape found in L:
    a. Check if any cell belonging to this shape exists in row `r5`.
    b. If the shape does *not* intersect with row `r5`, copy all cells of this shape (preserving their color and relative row/column positions) into the output grid (O). If multiple shapes are copied to the same cell, the one processed later (based on shape sorting, e.g., by color then position) will overwrite previous ones.
7.  Return the final output grid (O).

Note: This hypothesis is based on observations but failed to perfectly replicate the training examples during analysis. It represents a structured attempt to capture the relationship between the halves and the unique element '5'. Further refinement is likely needed.
