**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) of single-digit integers. The grid dimensions remain constant between input and output.
2.  **Core Pattern:** The transformation appears centered around occurrences of the horizontal sequence `3 2 3`.
3.  **Changed Values:** The primary change involves replacing certain cells containing the digit `3` (and sometimes the digit `2`) with the digit `9`.
4.  **Context Dependency:** The exact pattern of replacement (which cells change to 9) depends on the local context around the `3 2 3` sequence. Specifically, it depends on:
    *   The values in the row directly above the `3 2 3`.
    *   The values in the row directly below the `3 2 3`.
    *   The presence of the digit `9` in the immediate vicinity (specifically, the perimeter of a 5x5 square centered on the `2`) of the `3 2 3` sequence in the input grid.
5.  **Replacement Value:** The digit `9` is consistently used as the replacement value.
6.  **Unchanged Values:** Digits other than `2` and `3` involved in the pattern (like `6`, `7`) and digits far from the pattern generally remain unchanged. The original `2` in the `3 2 3` pattern sometimes remains `2`, and sometimes changes to `9`. Some `3`s surrounding the `2` also remain unchanged depending on the specific case.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
Objects:
  - Grid: A 2D array of integers.
  - Cell: An individual element within the Grid, having a position (row, col) and a value (integer 0-9).
  - Pattern_323: A specific horizontal sequence of Cell values `3, 2, 3` located at `(r, c-1)`, `(r, c)`, `(r, c+1)`.
  - Neighborhood
