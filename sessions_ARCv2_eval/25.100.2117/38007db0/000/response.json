It appears structured as a 3x3 arrangement of smaller, repeating 7x7 blocks, separated by rows and columns of the value '1'. Each 7x7 block consists of a border of '1's enclosing a 5x5 area containing '6's and a pattern of '4's. The patterns of '4's vary slightly between these nine blocks.\n\nThe output is a 19x7 grid, also containing integers (1, 4, 6). It seems to be constructed by vertically stacking three distinct 7x7 blocks. Comparing the output structure to the input structure suggests that the output is formed by selecting specific 7x7 blocks from the input grid and arranging them vertically. Specifically, the three blocks composing the output appear to correspond to the top-right, middle-left, and bottom-middle blocks from the input's 3x3 arrangement.\n\n**Observed Facts:**\n\n"
