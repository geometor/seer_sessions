Input:
  type: grid
  rows: 19
  columns: 19
  values: [1, 4, 6]
  structure:
    - Composite grid composed of 3x3 arrangement of smaller blocks.
    - Separator value: 1 (forms grid lines).
    - Separator rows: [0, 6, 12, 18]
    - Separator columns: [0, 6, 12, 18]
    - Sub-blocks:
      - count: 9
      - dimensions: 7x7 (including surrounding '1' borders)
      - content: Border of '1's, inner area of '6's and '4's.
      - variations: The pattern of '4's differs slightly between sub-blocks.
      - locations:
        - Block(0,0): input[0:7, 0:7]
        - Block(0,1): input[0:7, 6:13]
        - Block(0,2): input[0:7, 12:19]
        - Block(1,0): input[6:13, 0:7]
        - Block(1,1): input[6:13, 6:13]
        - Block(1,2): input[6:13, 12:19]
        - Block(2,0): input[12:19, 0:7]
        - Block(2,1): input[12:19, 6:13]
        - Block(2,2): input[12:19, 12:19]

Output:
  type: grid
  rows: 19
  columns: 7
  values: [1, 4, 6]
  structure:
    - Vertical stack of three 7x7 blocks.

Transformation:
  action: selection and rearrangement
  mechanism:
    - Identify the 3x3 arrangement of 7x7 blocks within the input grid based on the grid lines of '1's.
    - Select three specific blocks from the input grid based on their position in the 3x3 arrangement:
      - Block 1: Top-right block (row 0, column 2) -> input[0:7, 12:19]
      - Block 2: Middle-left block (row 1, column 0) -> input[6:13, 0:7]
      - Block 3: Bottom-middle block (row 2, column 1) -> input[12:19, 6:13]
    - Construct the output grid by vertically stacking these three selected blocks in the order they were selected (Block 1 on top, Block 2 in the middle, Block 3 at the bottom).
