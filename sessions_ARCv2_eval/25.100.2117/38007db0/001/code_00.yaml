Input:
  type: grid
  structure:
    - Composite grid composed of an M x N arrangement of smaller sub-grids.
    - Dimensions and M x N layout vary between examples.
    - Separator value: Uniform value filling single rows and columns between sub-grids. Varies between examples (e.g., 1 in train_1, 3 in train_2).
    - Sub-grids:
      - dimensions: Uniform (e.g., 7x7 in provided examples).
      - content: Typically a border matching the separator value, enclosing internal patterns. Internal values vary.
      - variations: Internal patterns differ between sub-grids within the same input.
  Example Specifics:
    train_1:
      - dimensions: 19x19
      - separator: 1
      - layout: 3x3 (M=3, N=3)
      - sub-grid size: 7x7
    train_2:
      - dimensions: 19x25
      - separator: 3
      - layout: 3x4 (M=3, N=4)
      - sub-grid size: 7x7

Output:
  type: grid
  structure:
    - Vertical stack of three sub-grids.
    - dimensions: (3 * sub-grid_height) x (sub-grid_width). Matches sub-grid dimensions from input. (e.g., 19x7 for 7x7 sub-grids).
  Example Specifics:
    train_1: 19x7
    train_2: 19x7

Transformation:
  action: sub-grid identification, selection, and vertical concatenation.
  mechanism:
    - Identify the separator value (e.g., the value in input[0,0]).
    - Determine sub-grid dimensions (e.g., height=7, width=7) by finding the second row/column index containing the separator value.
    - Determine the M x N layout dimensions by dividing input grid dimensions by (sub-grid dimension + 1 separator line). (Note: Simpler to count separator lines). Or, more robustly, identify all separator row/column indices.
      - Number of block rows (M) = (number of horizontal separator lines) - 1
      - Number of block columns (N) = (number of vertical separator lines) - 1
    - Calculate the starting row/column indices for each sub-grid based on separator locations.
    - Select three specific sub-grids from the input grid based on their (row, column) index in the M x N arrangement:
      - Block 1: Sub-grid at index (0, 2).
      - Block 2: Sub-grid at index (1, 0).
      - Block 3: Sub-grid at index (2, N-1) (last column index).
    - Construct the output grid by vertically stacking these three selected sub-grids in the order: Block 1, Block 2, Block 3.
