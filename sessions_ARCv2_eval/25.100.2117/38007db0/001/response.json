            "text": "**Refined Perception:**\n\nThe input data consists of a grid of integers. This grid is structured as a larger composite grid formed by arranging smaller, equally sized sub-grids in an M x N layout (where M is the number of rows of sub-grids and N is the number of columns). These sub-grids are separated by single rows and columns filled entirely with a specific \"separator\" value. The overall dimensions of the input grid, the values used within the sub-grids, the separator value, and the M x N dimensions of the sub-grid arrangement can vary between tasks. Each sub-grid appears to have a border matching the separator value.\n\nThe output data is also a grid of integers. It is consistently formed by selecting exactly three specific sub-grids from the input's M x N arrangement and stacking them vertically in a predefined order. Consequently, the output grid's height is three times the height of a single sub-grid, and its width is equal to the width of a single sub-grid.\n\nThe core transformation involves identifying the structure of the input (separator value, sub-grid dimensions, M x N layout) and then selecting three sub-grids based on their position within the M x N layout: the one at (row 0, column 2), the one at (row 1, column 0), and the one at (row 2, column N-1, i.e., the last column). These selected sub-grids are then concatenated vertically in that specific order to produce the output.\n\n**Updated Observed Facts:**\n\n"

Varies between examples (e.g., 1 in train_1, 3 in train_2).\n    - Sub-grids:\n      - dimensions: Uniform (e.g., 7x7 in provided examples).\n      - content: Typically a border matching the separator value, enclosing internal patterns. Internal values vary.\n      - variations: Internal patterns differ between sub-grids within the same input.\n  Example Specifics:\n    train_1:\n      - dimensions: 19x19\n      - separator: 1\n      - layout: 3x3 (M=3, N=3)\n      - sub-grid size: 7x7\n    train_2:\n      - dimensions: 19x25\n      - separator: 3\n      - layout: 3x4 (M=3, N=4)\n      - sub-grid size: 7x7\n\nOutput:\n  type: grid\n  structure:\n    - Vertical stack of three sub-grids.\n    - dimensions: (3 * sub-grid_height) x (sub-grid_width). Matches sub-grid dimensions from input.

(Note: Simpler to count separator lines). Or, more robustly, identify all separator row/column indices.\n      - Number of block rows (M) = (number of horizontal separator lines) - 1\n      - Number of block columns (N) = (number of vertical separator lines) - 1\n    - Calculate the starting row/column indices for each sub-grid based on separator locations.\n    - Select three specific sub-grids from the input grid based on their (row, column) index in the M x N arrangement:\n      - Block 1: Sub-grid at index (0, 2).\n      - Block 2: Sub-grid at index (1, 0).\n      - Block 3: Sub-grid at index (2, N-1) (last column index).\n    - Construct the output grid by vertically stacking these three selected sub-grids in the order: Block 1, Block 2, Block 3.\n```"

Determine the dimensions (height `H`, width `W`) of the sub-grids by finding the indices of the second horizontal and vertical separator lines (lines composed solely of the separator value). The height `H` is the index of the second horizontal separator line. The width `W` is the index of the second vertical separator line.\n4.  Identify the grid locations of all sub-grids. Determine the number of sub-grid rows (M) and columns (N) in the input's arrangement. `N` can be calculated as (Input Width / `W`).\n5.  Calculate the starting indices for each sub-grid. Sub-grid (r, c) starts at row `r * H` and column `c * W`.\n6.  Extract the sub-grid located at index (row=0, column=2) from the input's M x N arrangement. This corresponds to input grid slice `[0*H : 1*H, 2*W : 3*W]`.\n7.  Extract the sub-grid located at index (row=1, column=0). This corresponds to input grid slice `[1*H : 2*H, 0*W : 1*W]`.\n8.  Extract the sub-grid located at index (row=2, column=N-1). This corresponds to input grid slice `[2*H : 3*H, (N-1)*W : N*W]`.\n9.  Construct the final output grid by vertically concatenating the three extracted sub-grids in the order they were extracted (step 6, then step 7, then step 8)."
