**Initial Perception:**

The input is a 19x19 grid of integers (1, 4, 6). It appears structured as a 3x3 arrangement of smaller, repeating 7x7 blocks, separated by rows and columns of the value '1'. Each 7x7 block consists of a border of '1's enclosing a 5x5 area containing '6's and a pattern of '4's. The patterns of '4's vary slightly between these nine blocks.

The output is a 19x7 grid, also containing integers (1, 4, 6). It seems to be constructed by vertically stacking three distinct 7x7 blocks. Comparing the output structure to the input structure suggests that the output is formed by selecting specific 7x7 blocks from the input grid and arranging them vertically. Specifically, the three blocks composing the output appear to correspond to the top-right, middle-left, and bottom-middle blocks from the input's 3x3 arrangement.

**Observed Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: grid
  rows: 19
  columns: 19
  values: [1, 4, 6]
  structure:
    - Composite grid composed of 3x3 arrangement of smaller blocks.
    - Separator value: 1 (forms grid lines).
    - Separator rows: [0, 6, 12, 18]
    - Separator columns: [0, 6, 12, 18]
    - Sub-blocks:
      - count: 9
      - dimensions: 7x7 (including surrounding '1' borders)
      - content: Border of '1's, inner area of '6's and '4's.
      - variations: The pattern of '4's differs slightly between sub-blocks.
      - locations:
        - Block(0,0): input[0:7, 0:7]
        - Block(0,1): input[0:7, 6:13]
        - Block(0,2): input[0:7, 12:19]
        - Block(1,0): input[6:13, 0:7]
        - Block(1,1): input[6:13, 6:13]
        - Block(1,2): input[6:13, 12:19]
        - Block(2,0): input[12:19, 0:7]
        - Block(2,1): input[12:19, 6:13]
        - Block(2,2): input[12:19, 12:19]

Output:
  type: grid
  rows: 19
  columns: 7
  values: [1, 4, 6]
  structure:
    - Vertical stack of three 7x7 blocks.

Transformation:
  action: selection and rearrangement
  mechanism:
    - Identify the 3x3 arrangement of 7x7 blocks within the input grid based on the grid lines of '1's.
    - Select three specific blocks from the input grid based on their position in the 3x3 arrangement:
      - Block 1: Top-right block (row 0, column 2) -> input[0:7, 12:19]
      - Block 2: Middle-left block (row 1, column 0) -> input[6:13, 0:7]
      - Block 3: Bottom-middle block (row 2, column 1) -> input[12:19, 6:13]
    - Construct the output grid by vertically stacking these three selected blocks in the order they were selected (Block 1 on top, Block 2 in the middle, Block 3 at the bottom).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input grid to identify the 3x3 arrangement of 7x7 sub-grids, using the rows and columns containing only the value '1' as delimiters.
2.  Extract the 7x7 sub-grid located at the top-right position (row index 0, column index 2) of this 3x3 arrangement.
3.  Extract the 7x7 sub-grid located at the middle-left position (row index 1, column index 0).
4.  Extract the 7x7 sub-grid located at the bottom-middle position (row index 2, column index 1).
5.  Construct the output grid by vertically concatenating these three extracted sub-grids in the order they were extracted: top-right block first, followed by the middle-left block, and finally the bottom-middle block.
