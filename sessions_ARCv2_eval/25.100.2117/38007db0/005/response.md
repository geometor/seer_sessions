**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code execution resulted in outputs with incorrect dimensions (21x7 instead of 19x7) for both training examples, indicating a flaw in the output construction phase rather than just block selection. The extracted blocks were likely the correct 7x7 size, but simply stacking them vertically produced the erroneous 21-row output.

The key observation is that the expected output height (19) is not a multiple of the sub-grid height (7). However, 19 = 7 + 6 + 6. This strongly suggests an overlapping stacking mechanism: the first selected block is used entirely, but subsequent blocks have their first row (which is a separator line) removed before being appended.

The strategy is to:
1.  Maintain the refined block selection rule identified previously: Block1 at (0, 2), Block2 at (1, 0), and Block3 at (2, C3), where C3 = (N-1) if N (number of block columns) is even, and C3 = (N-2) if N is odd.
2.  Confirm the sub-grid extraction logic correctly captures the 7x7 blocks including their borders using slice `[sep_rows[r] : sep_rows[r+1]+1, sep_cols[c] : sep_cols[c+1]+1]`.
3.  Implement the output construction by vertically stacking: Block1, Block2 (rows 1 to end), and Block3 (rows 1 to end).
4.  Gather metrics to verify the dimensions, N, C3, and the content of the boundary rows involved in the overlap.

**Analysis of New Metrics:**

The metrics confirm the refined hypothesis:
*   The input grids are correctly parsed into 3x3 and 3x4 block arrangements with 7x7 sub-grids.
*   The rule for selecting the third block's column index (C3 = N-1 for even N, C3 = N-2 for odd N) yields the correct indices (1 for N=3, 3 for N=4).
*   The extracted 7x7 blocks are correctly identified.
*   The crucial "Overlap Check (Block1[-1] == Block2[0])" is True for both examples, supporting the idea that the first row of the second block duplicates the last row of the first. (Similarly for Block2[-1] and Block3[0]).
*   The "Output Construction Verification" is True for both examples, confirming that stacking `Block1`, `Block2[1:, :]`, and `Block3[1:, :]` perfectly reconstructs the expected output grids, matching both size (19x7) and content.

**YAML Facts**



```yaml
Input:
  type: grid
  structure:
    - Composite grid composed of an M x N arrangement of smaller sub-grids.
    - M: Number of sub-grid rows (must be >= 3 for this task).
    - N: Number of sub-grid columns.
    - Separator value: Uniform value filling single rows and columns between sub-grids, identifiable at input[0,0].
    - Separator lines: Defined by rows/columns filled entirely with the separator value. Indices stored in `sep_rows` and `sep_cols`.
    - Sub-grids:
      - Identification: Located between consecutive separator lines.
      - Dimensions: Uniform (H x W), where H = sep_rows[1]-sep_rows[0]+1, W = sep_cols[1]-sep_cols[0]+1. (Observed H=7, W=7 in examples).
      - Indexing: Sub-grids indexed by (row_index r, column_index c) from 0 to M-1 and 0 to N-1.
      - Location: Sub-grid(r, c) corresponds to input array slice `[sep_rows[r] : sep_rows[r+1]+1, sep_cols[c] : sep_cols[c+1]+1]`.
      - Property: The last row of any sub-grid(r, c) is identical to the first row of sub-grid(r+1, c). Similarly, the last column matches the first column of sub-grid(r, c+1). This implies separator lines are part of the sub-grids.

Output:
  type: grid
  structure:
    - Vertical stack derived from three specific sub-grids from the input.
    - dimensions: ((H) + (H-1) + (H-1)) x W = (3*H - 2) x W. (Observed 19x7 in examples, consistent with H=7).

Transformation:
  action: Sub-grid identification, selection based on index and N, overlapping vertical concatenation.
  mechanism:
    - Identify separator value, `sep_rows`, `sep_cols`.
    - Determine number of block columns, N = len(sep_cols) - 1.
    - Determine block dimensions H and W.
    - Define target block indices:
      - Index 1: (r1=0, c1=2)
      - Index 2: (r2=1, c2=0)
      - Index 3: (r3=2, c3=C3), where C3 = (N - 1) if N is even, else C3 = (N - 2).
    - Validate that M>=3 and column indices c1, c2, c3 are valid (0 <= c < N).
    - Extract the three target sub-grids (Block1, Block2, Block3) using the slicing logic: `input[sep_rows[r] : sep_rows[r+1]+1, sep_cols[c] : sep_cols[c+1]+1]`.
    - Construct the output grid by vertically concatenating:
      - Block1 (all H rows)
      - Block2, excluding its first row (rows 1 to H-1, i.e., `Block2[1:, :]`)
      - Block3, excluding its first row (rows 1 to H-1, i.e., `Block3[1:, :]`)
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Read the input grid.
2.  Identify the separator value (the value at grid position [0, 0]).
3.  Find the indices of all rows (`sep_rows`) and columns (`sep_cols`) that consist entirely of the separator value.
4.  Validate that there are at least 4 separator rows (implying at least 3 block rows, M>=3) and at least 3 separator columns (N>=2 required for index c=2). If not, the transformation cannot be applied.
5.  Calculate the number of sub-grid columns, `N = len(sep_cols) - 1`.
6.  Determine the column index for the third block (`C3`): If `N` is even, set `C3 = N - 1`. If `N` is odd, set `C3 = N - 2`.
7.  Define the indices of the three sub-grids to select: `Index1 = (0, 2)`, `Index2 = (1, 0)`, `Index3 = (2, C3)`.
8.  Validate that the column indices (2, 0, and `C3`) are valid (i.e., less than `N`). If not, the transformation cannot be applied.
9.  Extract the first sub-grid (`Block1`) corresponding to `Index1` using the slice: `input[sep_rows[0] : sep_rows[1]+1, sep_cols[2] : sep_cols[3]+1]`.
10. Extract the second sub-grid (`Block2`) corresponding to `Index2` using the slice: `input[sep_rows[1] : sep_rows[2]+1, sep_cols[0] : sep_cols[1]+1]`.
11. Extract the third sub-grid (`Block3`) corresponding to `Index3` using the slice: `input[sep_rows[2] : sep_rows[3]+1, sep_cols[C3] : sep_cols[C3+1]+1]`.
12. Construct the final output grid by vertically concatenating `Block1`, `Block2` excluding its first row (`Block2[1:, :]`), and `Block3` excluding its first row (`Block3[1:, :]`).
