**Initial Perception:**

The input is a 19x19 grid of integers (1, 4, 6). It appears structured as a 3x3 arrangement of smaller, repeating 7x7 blocks, separated by rows and columns of the value '1'. Each 7x7 block consists of a border of '1's enclosing a 5x5 area containing '6's and a pattern of '4's. The patterns of '4's vary slightly between these nine blocks.

The output is a 19x7 grid, also containing integers (1, 4, 6). It seems to be constructed by vertically stacking three distinct 7x7 blocks. Comparing the output structure to the input structure suggests that the output is formed by selecting specific 7x7 blocks from the input grid and arranging them vertically. Specifically, the three blocks composing the output appear to correspond to the top-right, middle-left, and bottom-middle blocks from the input's 3x3 arrangement.

  columns: 7
  values: [1, 4, 6]
  structure:
    - Vertical stack of three 7x7 blocks.

Transformation:
  action: selection and rearrangement
  mechanism:
    - Identify the 3x3 arrangement of 7x7 blocks within the input grid based on the grid lines of '1's.
    - Select three specific blocks from the input grid based on their position in the 3x3 arrangement:
      - Block 1: Top-right block (row 0, column 2) -> input[0:7, 12:19]
      - Block 2: Middle-left block (row 1, column 0) -> input[6:13, 0:7]
      - Block 3: Bottom-middle block (row 2, column 1) -> input[12:19, 6:13]
    - Construct the output grid by vertically stacking these three selected blocks in the order they were selected (Block 1 on top, Block 2 in the middle, Block 3 at the bottom).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input grid to identify the 3x3 arrangement of 7x7 sub-grids, using the rows and columns containing only the value '1' as delimiters.
2.  Extract the 7x7 sub-grid located at the top-right position (row index 0, column index 2) of this 3x3 arrangement.
3.  Extract the 7x7 sub-grid located at the middle-left position (row index 1, column index 0).
4.  Extract the 7x7 sub-grid located at the bottom-middle position (row index 2, column index 1).
5.  Construct the output grid by vertically concatenating these three extracted sub-grids in the order they were extracted: top-right block first, followed by the middle-left block, and finally the bottom-middle block.

**Refined Perception:**

The input data consists of a grid of integers. This grid is structured as a larger composite grid formed by arranging smaller, equally sized sub-grids in an M x N layout (where M is the number of rows of sub-grids and N is the number of columns). These sub-grids are separated by single rows and columns filled entirely with a specific "separator" value. The overall dimensions of the input grid, the values used within the sub-grids, the separator value, and the M x N dimensions of the sub-grid arrangement can vary between tasks. Each sub-grid appears to have a border matching the separator value.

The output data is also a grid of integers. It is consistently formed by selecting exactly three specific sub-grids from the input's M x N arrangement and stacking them vertically in a predefined order. Consequently, the output grid's height is three times the height of a single sub-grid, and its width is equal to the width of a single sub-grid.

The core transformation involves identifying the structure of the input (separator value, sub-grid dimensions, M x N layout) and then selecting three sub-grids based on their position within the M x N layout: the one at (row 0, column 2), the one at (row 1, column 0), and the one at (row 2, column N-1, i.e., the last column). These selected sub-grids are then concatenated vertically in that specific order to produce the output.

**Updated Observed Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: grid
  structure:
    - Composite grid composed of an M x N arrangement of smaller sub-grids.
    - Dimensions and M x N layout vary between examples.
    - Separator value: Uniform value filling single rows and columns between sub-grids. Varies between examples (e.g., 1 in train_1, 3 in train_2).
    - Sub-grids:
      - dimensions: Uniform (e.g., 7x7 in provided examples).
      - content: Typically a border matching the separator value, enclosing internal patterns. Internal values vary.
      - variations: Internal patterns differ between sub-grids within the same input.
  Example Specifics:
    train_1:
      - dimensions: 19x19
      - separator: 1
      - layout: 3x3 (M=3, N=3)
      - sub-grid size: 7x7
    train_2:
      - dimensions: 19x25
      - separator: 3
      - layout: 3x4 (M=3, N=4)
      - sub-grid size: 7x7

Output:
  type: grid
  structure:
    - Vertical stack of three sub-grids.
    - dimensions: (3 * sub-grid_height) x (sub-grid_width). Matches sub-grid dimensions from input. (e.g., 19x7 for 7x7 sub-grids).
  Example Specifics:
    train_1: 19x7
    train_2: 19x7

Transformation:
  action: sub-grid identification, selection, and vertical concatenation.
  mechanism:
    - Identify the separator value (e.g., the value in input[0,0]).
    - Determine sub-grid dimensions (e.g., height=7, width=7) by finding the second row/column index containing the separator value.
    - Determine the M x N layout dimensions by dividing input grid dimensions by (sub-grid dimension + 1 separator line). (Note: Simpler to count separator lines). Or, more robustly, identify all separator row/column indices.
      - Number of block rows (M) = (number of horizontal separator lines) - 1
      - Number of block columns (N) = (number of vertical separator lines) - 1
    - Calculate the starting row/column indices for each sub-grid based on separator locations.
    - Select three specific sub-grids from the input grid based on their (row, column) index in the M x N arrangement:
      - Block 1: Sub-grid at index (0, 2).
      - Block 2: Sub-grid at index (1, 0).
      - Block 3: Sub-grid at index (2, N-1) (last column index).
    - Construct the output grid by vertically stacking these three selected sub-grids in the order: Block 1, Block 2, Block 3.
```


**Updated Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input grid.
2.  Identify the separator value (typically the value at grid position [0, 0]).
3.  Determine the dimensions (height `H`, width `W`) of the sub-grids by finding the indices of the second horizontal and vertical separator lines (lines composed solely of the separator value). The height `H` is the index of the second horizontal separator line. The width `W` is the index of the second vertical separator line.
4.  Identify the grid locations of all sub-grids. Determine the number of sub-grid rows (M) and columns (N) in the input's arrangement. `N` can be calculated as (Input Width / `W`).
5.  Calculate the starting indices for each sub-grid. Sub-grid (r, c) starts at row `r * H` and column `c * W`.
6.  Extract the sub-grid located at index (row=0, column=2) from the input's M x N arrangement. This corresponds to input grid slice `[0*H : 1*H, 2*W : 3*W]`.
7.  Extract the sub-grid located at index (row=1, column=0). This corresponds to input grid slice `[1*H : 2*H, 0*W : 1*W]`.
8.  Extract the sub-grid located at index (row=2, column=N-1). This corresponds to input grid slice `[2*H : 3*H, (N-1)*W : N*W]`.
9.  Construct the final output grid by vertically concatenating the three extracted sub-grids in the order they were extracted (step 6, then step 7, then step 8).
