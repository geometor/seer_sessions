            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The initial code correctly identified a key differentiator (`(0, 6+, 0)` pattern) but made incorrect assumptions about the resulting transformations in both cases (pattern present/absent). The provided results show the code failed significantly on Example 1 and Example 2, while being nearly correct on Example 3. The primary errors involve:\n    1.  Incorrectly handling the transformation when the `(0, 6+, 0)` pattern is present (Case 1 in the failed code). The rule involves shifting blocks of 0s, not individual 0s, and the placement of 2s depends on further conditions.\n    2.  Incorrectly identifying the trigger condition. The number of distinct 0-shapes appears to be the primary differentiator (2 vs. not 2), rather than the presence/absence of the `(0, 6+, 0)` pattern itself, although that pattern is still used within the logic branches.\n    3.  Incorrectly deriving the coordinates/rules for placing the '2' blocks/lines in both main cases. The rules involve the marker column, grid width, specific pattern rows (`(0, 6, 0)` vs `(0, 6+, 0)`), shape membership, vertical connectivity, and potentially the presence of `(0, 6, 6+, 0)` patterns.\n\n*   **Strategy:**\n    1.  Revise the primary condition to be based on the number of distinct 0-shapes found in the input (== 2 vs. != 2).\n    2.  Refine the transformation logic for the `num_shapes == 2` case (Case A) based on Example 1, focusing on replacing 0s with 6s and placing two blocks of 2s based on `(0, 6, 0)` pattern rows within each shape, using an `r` to `r+1` vertical extent.\n    3.  Refine the transformation logic for the `num_shapes != 2` case (Case B) based on Examples 2 and 3. This involves shifting horizontal blocks of 0s right. The placement of 2s depends on whether only `(0, 6, 0)` patterns exist or if longer `(0, 6, 6+, 0)` patterns also exist.\n        *   If longer patterns exist (Ex3): Place 2s only in the pattern rows `r`.\n        *   If only `(0, 6, 0)` exists (Ex2): Place 2s in rows `r` and `r+1`, but *only if* the 0s forming the pattern in row `r` are vertically connected (part of the same shape) to 0s in row `r+1`. If not connected, no 2s are placed for that pattern row `r`.\n    4.  Implement helper functions carefully for shape finding, block shifting, pattern detection (`(0, 6, 0)` vs `(0, 6+, 0)` vs `(0, 6, 6+, 0)`), and vertical connectivity checks.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    (Using tool code to verify properties relevant to the new hypothesis)\n"
