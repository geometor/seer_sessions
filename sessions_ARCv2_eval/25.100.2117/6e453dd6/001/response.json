            "text": "*   **Refined Perception:**\n\n    The task involves transforming a grid containing background cells (6), a vertical marker line (5), and foreground shapes made of 0s. The transformation logic depends critically on whether the specific horizontal pattern `[0, 6, 0]` exists anywhere in the input grid rows.\n\n    *   If the `[0, 6, 0]` pattern *is present* (as in `train_2`), the transformation involves:\n        1.  Shifting all 0s one column to the right.\n        2.  Replacing the original locations of the 0s with the background value (6).\n        3.  Identifying the rows containing the `[0, 6, 0]` pattern.\n        4.  For each such row `r`, adding rectangles of 2s in the output grid at rows `r` and `r+1`, in columns determined relative to the marker line's position (specifically, from marker column + 2 to marker column + 5).\n\n    *   If the `[0, 6, 0]` pattern *is absent* (as in `train_1`), the transformation involves:\n        1.  Identifying the distinct shapes formed by the 0s (assuming exactly two shapes).\n        2.  Calculating the bounding boxes of these two shapes.\n        3.  Replacing all 0s with the background value (6).\n        4.  Adding a single rectangle of 2s, whose coordinates are derived from the minimum/maximum row/column indices of the two input shapes' bounding boxes.\n\n    The marker line (5) is always preserved in its original location. The grid dimensions can vary between examples.\n\n*   **Updated Facts:**\n\n    "
