*   **Initial Perception:**

    The task involves transforming a grid of numbers. The input grid primarily consists of the number 6, with some scattered 0s forming distinct shapes and a single vertical line of 5s. The output grid retains the background 6s and the line of 5s but replaces the 0s. A new rectangular area filled with 2s appears in the output. The transformation seems to involve identifying the shapes formed by the 0s in the input, removing them (filling with 6s), and then using properties (like bounding box coordinates) of these shapes to determine the location and size of the new rectangle of 2s in the output.

*   **Observed Facts:**

    
```yaml
    input_grid:
      type: 2D array (list of lists)
      dimensions: 16x16
      values:
        - 0: Forms distinct shapes (two L-shapes in this example)
        - 5: Forms a vertical line at column index 11
        - 6: Background value
    output_grid:
      type: 2D array (list of lists)
      dimensions: 16x16
      values:
        - 2: Forms a rectangular region in the output
        - 5: Forms a vertical line at column index 11 (preserved from input)
        - 6: Background value (original 6s and replaced 0s)
    objects:
      - background: Composed of cells with value 6.
      - marker_line: A vertical line composed of cells with value 5.
      - input_shapes: Contiguous regions composed of cells with value 0.
        - shape_1: An L-shape in the upper-left quadrant. Bounding box: rows 0-7, cols 4-10.
        - shape_2: An L-shape (rotated) in the lower-right quadrant. Bounding box: rows 11-14, cols 8-10.
      - output_rectangle: A rectangular region composed of cells with value 2. Bounding box: rows 4-7, cols 12-15.
    relationships:
      - The marker_line (value 5) is unchanged between input and output.
      - The background value (6) persists, replacing the input_shapes (value 0).
      - The location and dimensions of the output_rectangle (value 2) appear derived from the bounding boxes of the two input_shapes.
        - Output rectangle top row = Input shape 1 min column index.
        - Output rectangle bottom row = Input shape 1 max row index.
        - Output rectangle left column = Input shape 2 min row index + 1.
        - Output rectangle right column = Input shape 2 max row index + 1.
        - Output rectangle height = Input shape 2 height.
        - Output rectangle width = Input shape 2 height.
    actions:
      - Identify all contiguous shapes formed by the value 0 in the input grid.
      - Calculate the bounding box for each identified shape.
      - Determine which shape corresponds to 'shape 1' (e.g., the one with the overall minimum row index) and which is 'shape 2'.
      - Replace all 0s in the input grid with 6s to form the initial output grid base.
      - Calculate the coordinates for the output rectangle using the bounding box properties of shape 1 and shape 2 as described in 'relationships'.
      - Fill the calculated rectangular area in the output grid with the value 2.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**

    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Find all distinct contiguous regions (shapes) composed of the value 0 in the input grid.
    3.  If exactly two such shapes are found:
        a.  Determine the bounding box (minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, maximum column) for each shape.
        b.  Identify 'Shape 1' as the shape whose bounding box has the smaller minimum row index. Identify 'Shape 2' as the other shape.
        c.  Let Bbox1 = (r1_min, c1_min, r1_max, c1_max) be the bounding box of Shape 1.
        d.  Let Bbox2 = (r2_min, c2_min, r2_max, c2_max) be the bounding box of Shape 2.
        e.  Replace all cells with the value 0 in the output grid with the value 6.
        f.  Calculate the coordinates for a new rectangular region:
            i.  `top_row = c1_min`
            ii. `bottom_row = r1_max`
            iii. `left_col = r2_min + 1`
            iv. `right_col = r2_max + 1`
        g.  Fill all cells within the calculated rectangle (from `top_row` to `bottom_row` inclusive, and from `left_col` to `right_col` inclusive) in the output grid with the value 2.
    4.  If the number of shapes is not exactly two, return the initial copy of the input grid with 0s potentially replaced by 6s (or handle as an error/undefined case based on further examples).
