*   **Initial Perception:**

    The task involves transforming a grid of numbers. The input grid primarily consists of the number 6, with some scattered 0s forming distinct shapes and a single vertical line of 5s. The output grid retains the background 6s and the line of 5s but replaces the 0s. A new rectangular area filled with 2s appears in the output. The transformation seems to involve identifying the shapes formed by the 0s in the input, removing them (filling with 6s), and then using properties (like bounding box coordinates) of these shapes to determine the location and size of the new rectangle of 2s in the output.

*   **Observed Facts:**

    input_grid:
      type: 2D array (list of lists)
      dimensions: 16x16
      values:
        - 0: Forms distinct shapes (two L-shapes in this example)
        - 5: Forms a vertical line at column index 11
        - 6: Background value
    output_grid:
      type: 2D array (list of lists)
      dimensions: 16x16
      values:
        - 2: Forms a rectangular region in the output
        - 5: Forms a vertical line at column index 11 (preserved from input)
        - 6: Background value (original 6s and replaced 0s)
    objects:
      - background: Composed of cells with value 6.
      - marker_line: A vertical line composed of cells with value 5.
      - input_shapes: Contiguous regions composed of cells with value 0.
        - shape_1: An L-shape in the upper-left quadrant. Bounding box: rows 0-7, cols 4-10.
        - shape_2: An L-shape (rotated) in the lower-right quadrant. Bounding box: rows 11-14, cols 8-10.
      - output_rectangle: A rectangular region composed of cells with value 2. Bounding box: rows 4-7, cols 12-15.
    relationships:
      - The marker_line (value 5) is unchanged between input and output.
      - The background value (6) persists, replacing the input_shapes (value 0).
      - The location and dimensions of the output_rectangle (value 2) appear derived from the bounding boxes of the two input_shapes.
        - Output rectangle top row = Input shape 1 min column index.
        - Output rectangle bottom row = Input shape 1 max row index.
        - Output rectangle left column = Input shape 2 min row index + 1.
        - Output rectangle right column = Input shape 2 max row index + 1.
        - Output rectangle height = Input shape 2 height.
        - Output rectangle width = Input shape 2 height.
    actions:
      - Identify all contiguous shapes formed by the value 0 in the input grid.
      - Calculate the bounding box for each identified shape.
      - Determine which shape corresponds to 'shape 1' (e.g., the one with the overall minimum row index) and which is 'shape 2'.
      - Replace all 0s in the input grid with 6s to form the initial output grid base.
      - Calculate the coordinates for the output rectangle using the bounding box properties of shape 1 and shape 2 as described in 'relationships'.
      - Fill the calculated rectangular area in the output grid with the value 2.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**

    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Find all distinct contiguous regions (shapes) composed of the value 0 in the input grid.
    3.  If exactly two such shapes are found:
        a.  Determine the bounding box (minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, maximum column) for each shape.
        b.  Identify 'Shape 1' as the shape whose bounding box has the smaller minimum row index. Identify 'Shape 2' as the other shape.
        c.  Let Bbox1 = (r1_min, c1_min, r1_max, c1_max) be the bounding box of Shape 1.
        d.  Let Bbox2 = (r2_min, c2_min, r2_max, c2_max) be the bounding box of Shape 2.
        e.  Replace all cells with the value 0 in the output grid with the value 6.
        f.  Calculate the coordinates for a new rectangular region:
            i.  `top_row = c1_min`
            ii. `bottom_row = r1_max`
            iii. `left_col = r2_min + 1`
            iv. `right_col = r2_max + 1`
        g.  Fill all cells within the calculated rectangle (from `top_row` to `bottom_row` inclusive, and from `left_col` to `right_col` inclusive) in the output grid with the value 2.
    4.  If the number of shapes is not exactly two, return the initial copy of the input grid with 0s potentially replaced by 6s (or handle as an error/undefined case based on further examples).

*   **Refined Perception:**

    The task involves transforming a grid containing background cells (6), a vertical marker line (5), and foreground shapes made of 0s. The transformation logic depends critically on whether the specific horizontal pattern `[0, 6, 0]` exists anywhere in the input grid rows.

    *   If the `[0, 6, 0]` pattern *is present* (as in `train_2`), the transformation involves:
        1.  Shifting all 0s one column to the right.
        2.  Replacing the original locations of the 0s with the background value (6).
        3.  Identifying the rows containing the `[0, 6, 0]` pattern.
        4.  For each such row `r`, adding rectangles of 2s in the output grid at rows `r` and `r+1`, in columns determined relative to the marker line's position (specifically, from marker column + 2 to marker column + 5).

    *   If the `[0, 6, 0]` pattern *is absent* (as in `train_1`), the transformation involves:
        1.  Identifying the distinct shapes formed by the 0s (assuming exactly two shapes).
        2.  Calculating the bounding boxes of these two shapes.
        3.  Replacing all 0s with the background value (6).
        4.  Adding a single rectangle of 2s, whose coordinates are derived from the minimum/maximum row/column indices of the two input shapes' bounding boxes.

    The marker line (5) is always preserved in its original location. The grid dimensions can vary between examples.

      - output_rectangles_2: Rectangular regions of cells with value 2.
    patterns:
      - trigger_pattern: The horizontal sequence [0, 6, 0] appearing in any row of the input grid.
    relationships_and_conditions:
      - The marker_line (5) is always unchanged.
      - Condition: Check if the trigger_pattern [0, 6, 0] exists in any input row.
      - Case 1 (Trigger pattern exists - e.g., train_2):
          - Input 0s at (r, c) are effectively moved to output 0s at (r, c+1).
          - Original input 0 locations (r, c) become 6 in the output.
          - For each input row 'r' containing the trigger_pattern [0, 6, 0]:
              - A block of 2s is created in the output grid covering rows r and r+1 (within grid bounds).
              - This block spans columns from c5 + 2 to c5 + 5 (inclusive).
      - Case 2 (Trigger pattern does NOT exist - e.g., train_1):
          - All input 0s are replaced by 6s in the output grid. No 0s remain.
          - Exactly two input_shapes are assumed to exist.
          - Bbox1 (r1_min, c1_min, r1_max, c1_max) is found for the shape with the overall minimum row index.
          - Bbox2 (r2_min, c2_min, r2_max, c2_max) is found for the other shape.
          - A single output_rectangle_2 is created with:
              - top_row = c1_min
              - bottom_row = r1_max
              - left_col = r2_min + 1
              - right_col = r2_max + 1
    actions:
      - Find the column index `c5` of the marker_line (value 5).
      - Check all rows in the input grid for the presence of the subsequence `[0, 6, 0]`.
      - Based on whether the pattern is found, apply the logic described in 'Case 1' or 'Case 2'.
      - Initialize the output grid appropriately (copying input or starting with background 6s).
      - Modify the output grid by placing 0s (if applicable), replacing 0s with 6s, copying the marker line, and drawing the rectangle(s) of 2s.
    ```


*   **Updated Natural Language Program:**

    1.  Create the output grid, initially as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Find the column index `c5` where the value 5 (marker line) occurs in the input grid.
    3.  Search the input grid to determine if any row contains the horizontal sequence
 `[0, 6, 0]`. Let `pattern_found` be true if found, false otherwise.
    4.  Find all coordinates `(r, c)` of cells with value 0 in the input grid. Store these coordinates.
    5.  **If `pattern_found` is true:**
        a.  Iterate through the stored input 0-coordinates `(r, c)`: Replace the value at `(r, c)` in the output grid with 6.
        b.  Iterate through the stored input 0-coordinates `(r, c)` again: Set the value at `(r, c+1)` in the output grid to 0 (ensure `c+1` is within grid bounds).
        c.  Iterate through each row index `r` of the input grid:
            i.  Check if the input row `r` contains the sequence `[0, 6, 0]`.
            ii. If it does, define the column range `c_start = c5 + 2` to `c_end = c5 + 5`.
            iii.Fill the cells in the output grid with 2s for row `r` in the column range `[c_start, c_end]` (inclusive, checking bounds).
            iv. Fill the cells in the output grid with 2s for row `r+1` in the column range `[c_start, c_end]` (inclusive, checking bounds).
    6.  **If `pattern_found` is false:**
        a.  Replace all cells with value 0 in the output grid with 6.
        b.  Identify all distinct contiguous regions (shapes) of 0s from the *original* input grid. Assume exactly two shapes are found.
        c.  Determine the bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) for each shape.
        d.  Identify 'Shape 1' as the shape whose bounding box has the smaller minimum row index. Let its bounding box be `(r1_min, c1_min, r1_max, c1_max)`.
        e.  Identify 'Shape 2' as the other shape. Let its bounding box be `(r2_min, c2_min, r2_max, c2_max)`.
        f.  Calculate the coordinates for the output rectangle:
            i.  `top_row = c1_min`
            ii. `bottom_row = r1_max`
            iii. `left_col = r2_min + 1`
            iv. `right_col = r2_max + 1`
        g.  Fill all cells within the calculated rectangle (from `top_row` to `bottom_row` inclusive, and from `left_col` to `right_col` inclusive) in the output grid with the value 2 (checking bounds).
    7.  Ensure the marker line (value 5) is correctly preserved in the output grid (it should be, as the modifications target 0s or specific calculated regions).
    8.  Return the final output grid.

*   **Refined Perception:**

    The task involves transforming a 2D grid based on the presence or absence of a specific horizontal pattern within the input rows: `(0, 6+, 0)`, meaning a `0` followed by one or more `6`s, followed by another `0`. The grid also contains a background value (6) and a single vertical marker line (5). The transformation rule depends entirely on whether this `(0, 6+, 0)` pattern exists anywhere in the input grid.

    *   **Case 1: Pattern `(0, 6+, 0)` is Present (Examples `train_2`, `train_3`)**
        *   All `0`s in the input grid are effectively shifted one column to the right in the output grid.
        *   The original locations of the input `0`s are filled with the background value `6`.
        *   For every row in the *input* grid that contained the `(0, 6+, 0)` pattern, the corresponding row in the *output* grid has cells filled with `2`s, starting from the column immediately to the right of the marker line (5) and extending to the right edge of the grid.

    *   **Case 2: Pattern `(0, 6+, 0)` is Absent (Example `train_1`)**
        *   All `0`s in the input grid are replaced by the background value `6`.
        *   The input grid is expected to contain exactly two distinct contiguous shapes formed by `0`s.
        *   The bounding boxes of these two input shapes are determined.
        *   A single rectangular area is filled with `2`s in the output grid. The coordinates of this rectangle are derived from a combination of the minimum/maximum row/column indices of the two input shapes' bounding boxes.

    The marker line (5) is always preserved in its original position in both cases. Grid dimensions can vary.

      - Condition: Check if `pattern_found` is true or false.

          - Input 0s at `(r, c)` are effectively moved to output 0s at `(r, c+1)` (within bounds).
          - Original input 0 locations `(r, c)` become 6 in the output.
          - For each input row `r_in` containing the `trigger_pattern`:
              - A horizontal line of 2s is created in the output grid at row `r_in`.
              - This line spans columns from `c5 + 1` to `width - 1` (inclusive).
      - Case 2 (`pattern_found` is false - e.g., train_1):

          - Exactly two `input_shapes_case2` are assumed to exist.
          - Bbox1 (`r1_min`, `c1_min`, `r1_max`, `c1_max`) and Bbox2 (`r2_min`, `c2_min`, `r2_max`, `c2_max`) are calculated.
          - A single rectangular `output_regions_2` is created with:
              - top_row = `c1_min`
              - bottom_row = `r1_max`
              - left_col = `r2_min + 1`
              - right_col = `r2_max + 1`
    actions:
      - Determine grid `height` and `width`.
      - Find the column index `c5` of the marker_line (value 5).
      - Scan all rows in the input grid to check for the presence of the `trigger_pattern` `(0, 6+, 0)`. Set `pattern_found` flag.
      - Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
      - Store the coordinates `(r, c)` of all input cells containing 0.
      - Apply Case 1 or Case 2 logic based on `pattern_found`:
          - Case 1: Modify output by setting original 0 positions to 6, setting `(r, c+1)` to 0, and drawing horizontal lines of 2s in relevant rows from `c5+1` to `width-1`.
          - Case 2: Modify output by setting all original 0 positions to 6, finding the two 0-shapes (from input), calculating the output rectangle coordinates based on their bounding boxes, and filling that rectangle with 2s.

*   **Updated Natural Language Program:**

    1.  Get the dimensions (`height`, `width`) of the input grid.
    2.  Find the column index `c5` where the value 5 (marker line) occurs in the input grid. Assume it exists and is unique.
    3.  Scan all rows of the input grid to determine if any row contains the horizontal pattern `(0, 6+, 0)` (a `0`, followed by one or more `6`s, followed by another `0`). Set a boolean flag `pattern_found` accordingly.
    4.  Create the `output` grid as a deep copy of the `input` grid.
    5.  Find and store all coordinates `(r, c)` where `input[r][c] == 0`. Let this list be `zero_coords`.
    6.  **If `pattern_found` is true (Case 1):**
        a.  Iterate through each coordinate `(r, c)` in `zero_coords`: Set `output[r][c] = 6`.
        b.  Iterate through each coordinate `(r, c)` in `zero_coords`: If `c + 1 < width`, set `output[r][c+1] = 0`.
        c.  Iterate through each row index `r_in` from 0 to `height - 1`:
            i.  Check if the original `input` grid's row `r_in` contains the `(0, 6+, 0)` pattern.
            ii. If yes, then for each column index `c_out` from `c5 + 1` to `width - 1` (inclusive): Set `output[r_in][c_out] = 2`.
    7.  **If `pattern_found` is false (Case 2):**
        a.  Iterate through each coordinate `(r, c)` in `zero_coords`: Set `output[r][c] = 6`.
        b.  Identify the distinct contiguous regions (shapes) formed by the cells listed in `zero_coords` within the *original input grid*. Assume exactly two shapes are found.
        c.  Calculate the bounding box (`r_min`, `c_min`, `r_max`, `c_max`) for each of the two shapes.
        d.  Identify 'Shape 1' as the shape whose bounding box has the smaller `r_min`. Let its bounding box be `(r1_min, c1_min, r1_max, c1_max)`.
        e.  Identify 'Shape 2' as the other shape. Let its bounding box be `(r2_min, c2_min, r2_max, c2_max)`.
        f.  Calculate the coordinates for the output rectangle:
            i.  `top_row = c1_min`
            ii. `bottom_row = r1_max`
            iii. `left_col = r2_min + 1`
            iv. `right_col = r2_max + 1`
        g.  Iterate through row indices `r` from `top_row` to `bottom_row` (inclusive) and column indices `c` from `left_col` to `right_col` (inclusive): If `r` and `c` are within grid bounds, set `output[r][c] = 2`.
    8.  Return the final `output` grid.

"""
Transforms a 2D grid based on the presence or absence of a specific horizontal 
pattern `(0, 6+, 0)` (a 0, followed by one or more 6s, followed by a 0) 
within any row of the input grid. The grid also contains a background value (6) 
and a single vertical marker line (5).

Transformation Rules:

Case 1: Pattern (0, 6+, 0) is Present
    - All 0s in the input grid are shifted one column to the right in the output grid.
    - The original locations of the input 0s are filled with the background value 6.
    - For every row in the *input* grid that contained the (0, 6+, 0) pattern, 
      the corresponding row in the *output* grid has cells filled with 2s, 
      starting from the column immediately to the right of the marker line (5) 
      and extending to the right edge of the grid.

Case 2: Pattern (0, 6+, 0) is Absent
    - All 0s in the input grid are replaced by the background value 6.
    - The input grid is expected to contain exactly two distinct contiguous shapes 
      formed by 0s.
    - The bounding boxes of these two input shapes are determined.
    - A single rectangular area is filled with 2s in the output grid. The 
      coordinates of this rectangle are derived from a combination of the 
      min/max row/col indices of the two input shapes' bounding boxes:
        - top_row = shape1.min_col
        - bottom_row = shape1.max_row
        - left_col = shape2.min_row + 1
        - right_col = shape2.max_row + 1
      (Where shape1 is the shape with the smaller min_row index).

The marker line (5) is always preserved in its original position.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial code correctly identified a key differentiator (`(0, 6+, 0)` pattern) but made incorrect assumptions about the resulting transformations in both cases (pattern present/absent). The provided results show the code failed significantly on Example 1 and Example 2, while being nearly correct on Example 3. The primary errors involve:
    1.  Incorrectly handling the transformation when the `(0, 6+, 0)` pattern is present (Case 1 in the failed code). The rule involves shifting blocks of 0s, not individual 0s, and the placement of 2s depends on further conditions.
    2.  Incorrectly identifying the trigger condition. The number of distinct 0-shapes appears to be the primary differentiator (2 vs. not 2), rather than the presence/absence of the `(0, 6+, 0)` pattern itself, although that pattern is still used within the logic branches.
    3.  Incorrectly deriving the coordinates/rules for placing the '2' blocks/lines in both main cases. The rules involve the marker column, grid width, specific pattern rows (`(0, 6, 0)` vs `(0, 6+, 0)`), shape membership, vertical connectivity, and potentially the presence of `(0, 6, 6+, 0)` patterns.

*   **Strategy:**
    1.  Revise the primary condition to be based on the number of distinct 0-shapes found in the input (== 2 vs. != 2).
    2.  Refine the transformation logic for the `num_shapes == 2` case (Case A) based on Example 1, focusing on replacing 0s with 6s and placing two blocks of 2s based on `(0, 6, 0)` pattern rows within each shape, using an `r` to `r+1` vertical extent.
    3.  Refine the transformation logic for the `num_shapes != 2` case (Case B) based on Examples 2 and 3. This involves shifting horizontal blocks of 0s right. The placement of 2s depends on whether only `(0, 6, 0)` patterns exist or if longer `(0, 6, 6+, 0)` patterns also exist.
        *   If longer patterns exist (Ex3): Place 2s only in the pattern rows `r`.
        *   If only `(0, 6, 0)` exists (Ex2): Place 2s in rows `r` and `r+1`, but *only if* the 0s forming the pattern in row `r` are vertically connected (part of the same shape) to 0s in row `r+1`. If not connected, no 2s are placed for that pattern row `r`.
    4.  Implement helper functions carefully for shape finding, block shifting, pattern detection (`(0, 6, 0)` vs `(0, 6+, 0)` vs `(0, 6, 6+, 0)`), and vertical connectivity checks.

*   **Metrics:**
    (Using tool code to verify properties relevant to the new hypothesis)
