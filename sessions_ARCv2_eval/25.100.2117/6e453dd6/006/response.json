            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n\n    The previous code failed primarily because the initial hypothesis about the main conditional logic (presence of `(0, 6+, 0)` pattern) was incorrect. The results clearly show that the core transformation logic depends on the *number of distinct contiguous shapes* formed by the value 0 in the input grid.\n    *   Example 1 has 2 shapes and follows one rule (Case A).\n    *   Examples 2 and 3 have more than 2 shapes and follow a different rule (Case B).\n    Within Case B, there's a sub-condition based on whether \"long\" patterns `(0, 6, 6+, 0)` exist, which affects how the '2's are placed.\n    Additionally, the \"shift\" operation in Case B applies to entire blocks (shapes) of 0s, not individual cells, and the previous code implemented this incorrectly. The rules for placing the '2's in both Case A and Case B also needed refinement based on the observed outputs.\n\n*   **Strategy:**\n\n    1.  **Revise Core Logic:** Change the main `if` condition to check `num_shapes == 2`.\n    2.  **Refine Case A (2 shapes):** Implement the logic described in the previous analysis: replace 0s with 6s, find bounding boxes, calculate the specific target rectangle based on BBox1 and BBox2 properties, and fill it with 2s.\n    3.  **Refine Case B (!= 2 shapes):**\n        *   Implement correct block shifting: find all 0-shapes, clear their original positions in the output (fill with 6), and draw them shifted one column right.\n        *   Implement the sub-condition logic:\n            *   Check for the presence of *any* `(0, 6, 6+, 0)` pattern in the input grid.\n            *   **Subcase B1 (Long pattern exists):** Find all input rows `r` with *any* `(0, 6+, 0)` pattern. Fill output row `r`, columns `marker_col + 1` to `width - 1` with 2s.\n            *   **Subcase B2 (Only short patterns):** Find all input rows `r` containing a `(0, 6, 0)` pattern starting at column `c > 0`. Check if the 0s involved in that specific pattern instance are vertically connected to any 0 in row `r+1`. If both conditions are met for row `r`, fill output row `r`, columns `marker_col + 1` to `width - 1` with 2s. Ensure each eligible row is filled only once.\n    4.  **Helper Functions:** Ensure helper functions for shape finding, pattern detection, bounding box calculation, and connectivity checking are accurate and robust.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    The following analysis confirms the properties relevant to the refined strategy.\n"

The crucial `pattern_060_rows_and_indices_c_gt_0` function only finds row 3 having the pattern `(0, 6, 0)` starting at `c>0`. This pattern instance *is* vertically connected. Therefore, only row 3 should receive 2s according to the refined rule. **This contradicts the previous analysis** which found patterns at c>0 in rows 3, 8, 14. Let me re-run the pattern check manually for Ex2:\n        *   Row 1: `0 6 0 6 6...` -> `(0,6,0)` at c=0.\n        *   Row 3: `6 0 6 0 6...` -> `(0,6,0)` at c=1.

No (c>0).\n        *   **The code execution is correct.** Only row 3 has a `(0, 6, 0)` pattern starting at `c>0`. This row *is* connected. So, the rule \"fill row `r` cols `marker_col+1` to `width-1`\" should apply only to row 3. `marker_col=5`, `width=10`. Fill row 3, cols 6-9. This exactly matches the expected output! The previous manual check incorrectly identified patterns in rows 8 and 14 as starting at c>0.\n    *   Example 3: Correctly identified as Case B (5 shapes), Subcase B1 (long pattern exists). It correctly finds rows 1, 5, 6, 13, 17 as containing a `(0, 6+, 0)` pattern. The rule is to fill these rows, cols `marker_col+1` to `width-1`. `marker_col=7`, `width=10`. Fill rows 1, 5, 6, 13, 17, cols 8-9. This exactly matches the 2s in the expected output.\n\n    The refined rules based on the corrected analysis seem to perfectly match the expected outputs for placing the '2's.

Find all distinct contiguous shapes (blocks) formed by the value 0 in the input grid and map each 0-coordinate to its shape ID.\n        b.  Count the number of shapes (`num_shapes`).\n        c.  Find the column index (`marker_col`) of the vertical line of 5s.\n        d.  Determine the grid `height` and `width`.\n\n    2.  **Conditional Logic (Based on `num_shapes`):**\n\n        a.  **If `num_shapes` is exactly 2 (Case A):**\n            i.   Initialize the `output_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`.\n            ii.  Replace all cells with value 0 in the `output_grid` with 6.\n            iii. Calculate the bounding box (`r_min`, `c_min`, `r_max`, `c_max`) for each of the two shapes.\n            iv.  Identify `Bbox1` (shape with smaller `r_min`) and `Bbox2` (the other shape).\n            v.   Calculate the dimensions and position of the target rectangle:\n                *   `rect_height = (Bbox2.r_max - Bbox2.r_min + 1)`\n                *   `top_row = Bbox1.r_max - rect_height + 1`\n                *   `bottom_row = Bbox1.r_max`\n                *   `left_col = Bbox2.r_min + 1`\n                *   `right_col = Bbox2.r_max + 1`\n            vi.

Replace `output_grid[r][c]` with 6.\n                *   Iterate through the coordinates `(r, c)` of the shape again. If `c + 1` is within the grid width, set `output_grid[r][c + 1] = 0`. (This performs the block shift).\n            iii. Check if any row in the *input grid* contains a \"long pattern\" (`0`, followed by two or more `6`s, followed by `0`).\n            iv.  **If a long pattern exists (Subcase B1):**\n                *   Find all row indices `r` in the *input grid* that contain *any* pattern `(0, 6+, 0)`.\n                *   For each such row `r`, fill the cells in the `output_grid` at row `r`, from column `marker_col + 1` to `width - 1` (inclusive), with the value 2.\n            v.   **If only short patterns (`0, 6, 0`) exist (Subcase B2):**\n                *   Find all row indices `r` where the pattern `(0, 6, 0)` occurs in the *input grid* starting at a column `c` which is greater than 0 (`c > 0`).\n                *   For each such row `r`: Check if any 0 involved in a pattern instance `(0, 6, 0)` starting at `c > 0` in that row `r` belongs to the same shape as any 0 in the row below (`r+1`), using the shape map from step 1a.\n                *   If such a vertical connection exists for row `r`: Fill the cells in the `output_grid` at row `r`, from column `marker_col + 1` to `width - 1` (inclusive), with the value 2.
