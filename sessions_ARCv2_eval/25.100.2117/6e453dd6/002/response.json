            "text": "*   **Refined Perception:**\n\n    The task involves transforming a 2D grid based on the presence or absence of a specific horizontal pattern within the input rows: `(0, 6+, 0)`, meaning a `0` followed by one or more `6`s, followed by another `0`. The grid also contains a background value (6) and a single vertical marker line (5). The transformation rule depends entirely on whether this `(0, 6+, 0)` pattern exists anywhere in the input grid.\n\n    *   **Case 1: Pattern `(0, 6+, 0)` is Present (Examples `train_2`, `train_3`)**\n        *   All `0`s in the input grid are effectively shifted one column to the right in the output grid.\n        *   The original locations of the input `0`s are filled with the background value `6`.\n        *   For every row in the *input* grid that contained the `(0, 6+, 0)` pattern, the corresponding row in the *output* grid has cells filled with `2`s, starting from the column immediately to the right of the marker line (5) and extending to the right edge of the grid.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Pattern `(0, 6+, 0)` is Absent (Example `train_1`)**\n        *   All `0`s in the input grid are replaced by the background value `6`.\n        *   The input grid is expected to contain exactly two distinct contiguous shapes formed by `0`s.\n        *   The bounding boxes of these two input shapes are determined.\n        *   A single rectangular area is filled with `2`s in the output grid. The coordinates of this rectangle are derived from a combination of the minimum/maximum row/column indices of the two input shapes' bounding boxes.\n\n    The marker line (5) is always preserved in its original position in both cases. Grid dimensions can vary.\n\n*   **Updated Facts:**\n\n    "
