*   **Initial Perception:**

    The task involves transforming a grid of numbers. The input grid primarily consists of the number 6, with some scattered 0s forming distinct shapes and a single vertical line of 5s. The output grid retains the background 6s and the line of 5s but replaces the 0s. A new rectangular area filled with 2s appears in the output. The transformation seems to involve identifying the shapes formed by the 0s in the input, removing them (filling with 6s), and then using properties (like bounding box coordinates) of these shapes to determine the location and size of the new rectangle of 2s in the output.

*   **Observed Facts:**

    input_grid:
      type: 2D array (list of lists)
      dimensions: 16x16
      values:
        - 0: Forms distinct shapes (two L-shapes in this example)
        - 5: Forms a vertical line at column index 11
        - 6: Background value
    output_grid:
      type: 2D array (list of lists)
      dimensions: 16x16
      values:
        - 2: Forms a rectangular region in the output
        - 5: Forms a vertical line at column index 11 (preserved from input)
        - 6: Background value (original 6s and replaced 0s)
    objects:
      - background: Composed of cells with value 6.
      - marker_line: A vertical line composed of cells with value 5.
      - input_shapes: Contiguous regions composed of cells with value 0.
        - shape_1: An L-shape in the upper-left quadrant. Bounding box: rows 0-7, cols 4-10.
        - shape_2: An L-shape (rotated) in the lower-right quadrant. Bounding box: rows 11-14, cols 8-10.
      - output_rectangle: A rectangular region composed of cells with value 2. Bounding box: rows 4-7, cols 12-15.
    relationships:
      - The marker_line (value 5) is unchanged between input and output.
      - The background value (6) persists, replacing the input_shapes (value 0).
      - The location and dimensions of the output_rectangle (value 2) appear derived from the bounding boxes of the two input_shapes.
        - Output rectangle top row = Input shape 1 min column index.
        - Output rectangle bottom row = Input shape 1 max row index.
        - Output rectangle left column = Input shape 2 min row index + 1.
        - Output rectangle right column = Input shape 2 max row index + 1.
        - Output rectangle height = Input shape 2 height.
        - Output rectangle width = Input shape 2 height.
    actions:
      - Identify all contiguous shapes formed by the value 0 in the input grid.
      - Calculate the bounding box for each identified shape.
      - Determine which shape corresponds to 'shape 1' (e.g., the one with the overall minimum row index) and which is 'shape 2'.
      - Replace all 0s in the input grid with 6s to form the initial output grid base.
      - Calculate the coordinates for the output rectangle using the bounding box properties of shape 1 and shape 2 as described in 'relationships'.
      - Fill the calculated rectangular area in the output grid with the value 2.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**

    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Find all distinct contiguous regions (shapes) composed of the value 0 in the input grid.
    3.  If exactly two such shapes are found:
        a.  Determine the bounding box (minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, maximum column) for each shape.
        b.  Identify 'Shape 1' as the shape whose bounding box has the smaller minimum row index. Identify 'Shape 2' as the other shape.
        c.  Let Bbox1 = (r1_min, c1_min, r1_max, c1_max) be the bounding box of Shape 1.
        d.  Let Bbox2 = (r2_min, c2_min, r2_max, c2_max) be the bounding box of Shape 2.
        e.  Replace all cells with the value 0 in the output grid with the value 6.
        f.  Calculate the coordinates for a new rectangular region:
            i.  `top_row = c1_min`
            ii. `bottom_row = r1_max`
            iii. `left_col = r2_min + 1`
            iv. `right_col = r2_max + 1`
        g.  Fill all cells within the calculated rectangle (from `top_row` to `bottom_row` inclusive, and from `left_col` to `right_col` inclusive) in the output grid with the value 2.
    4.  If the number of shapes is not exactly two, return the initial copy of the input grid with 0s potentially replaced by 6s (or handle as an error/undefined case based on further examples).

*   **Refined Perception:**

    The task involves transforming a grid containing background cells (6), a vertical marker line (5), and foreground shapes made of 0s. The transformation logic depends critically on whether the specific horizontal pattern `[0, 6, 0]` exists anywhere in the input grid rows.

    *   If the `[0, 6, 0]` pattern *is present* (as in `train_2`), the transformation involves:
        1.  Shifting all 0s one column to the right.
        2.  Replacing the original locations of the 0s with the background value (6).
        3.  Identifying the rows containing the `[0, 6, 0]` pattern.
        4.  For each such row `r`, adding rectangles of 2s in the output grid at rows `r` and `r+1`, in columns determined relative to the marker line's position (specifically, from marker column + 2 to marker column + 5).

    *   If the `[0, 6, 0]` pattern *is absent* (as in `train_1`), the transformation involves:
        1.  Identifying the distinct shapes formed by the 0s (assuming exactly two shapes).
        2.  Calculating the bounding boxes of these two shapes.
        3.  Replacing all 0s with the background value (6).
        4.  Adding a single rectangle of 2s, whose coordinates are derived from the minimum/maximum row/column indices of the two input shapes' bounding boxes.

    The marker line (5) is always preserved in its original location. The grid dimensions can vary between examples.

*   **Updated Facts:**

    
```yaml
    input_grid:
      type: 2D array (list of lists)
      dimensions: Variable (e.g., 16x16, 16x10)
      values:
        - 0: Forms distinct foreground shapes. Key trigger pattern is [0, 6, 0] horizontally.
        - 5: Forms a single vertical marker line.
        - 6: Background value.
    output_grid:
      type: 2D array (list of lists)
      dimensions: Same as input grid.
      values:
        - 0: Present only if input contains [0, 6, 0]; represents input 0s shifted right.
        - 2: Forms rectangular regions. Location/presence depends on input pattern.
        - 5: Preserved vertical marker line from input.
        - 6: Background value (original 6s and replaced 0s).
    objects:
      - background: Cells with value 6.
      - marker_line: A vertical line of cells with value 5. Its column index is important (let's call it c5).
      - input_shapes: Contiguous regions of cells with value 0 in the input.
      - output_shapes_0: Contiguous regions of cells with value 0 in the output (shifted from input). Present only if input contains [0, 6, 0].
      - output_rectangles_2: Rectangular regions of cells with value 2.
    patterns:
      - trigger_pattern: The horizontal sequence [0, 6, 0] appearing in any row of the input grid.
    relationships_and_conditions:
      - The marker_line (5) is always unchanged.
      - Condition: Check if the trigger_pattern [0, 6, 0] exists in any input row.
      - Case 1 (Trigger pattern exists - e.g., train_2):
          - Input 0s at (r, c) are effectively moved to output 0s at (r, c+1).
          - Original input 0 locations (r, c) become 6 in the output.
          - For each input row 'r' containing the trigger_pattern [0, 6, 0]:
              - A block of 2s is created in the output grid covering rows r and r+1 (within grid bounds).
              - This block spans columns from c5 + 2 to c5 + 5 (inclusive).
      - Case 2 (Trigger pattern does NOT exist - e.g., train_1):
          - All input 0s are replaced by 6s in the output grid. No 0s remain.
          - Exactly two input_shapes are assumed to exist.
          - Bbox1 (r1_min, c1_min, r1_max, c1_max) is found for the shape with the overall minimum row index.
          - Bbox2 (r2_min, c2_min, r2_max, c2_max) is found for the other shape.
          - A single output_rectangle_2 is created with:
              - top_row = c1_min
              - bottom_row = r1_max
              - left_col = r2_min + 1
              - right_col = r2_max + 1
    actions:
      - Find the column index `c5` of the marker_line (value 5).
      - Check all rows in the input grid for the presence of the subsequence `[0, 6, 0]`.
      - Based on whether the pattern is found, apply the logic described in 'Case 1' or 'Case 2'.
      - Initialize the output grid appropriately (copying input or starting with background 6s).
      - Modify the output grid by placing 0s (if applicable), replacing 0s with 6s, copying the marker line, and drawing the rectangle(s) of 2s.
    ```


*   **Updated Natural Language Program:**

    1.  Create the output grid, initially as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Find the column index `c5` where the value 5 (marker line) occurs in the input grid.
    3.  Search the input grid to determine if any row contains the horizontal sequence
 `[0, 6, 0]`. Let `pattern_found` be true if found, false otherwise.
    4.  Find all coordinates `(r, c)` of cells with value 0 in the input grid. Store these coordinates.
    5.  **If `pattern_found` is true:**
        a.  Iterate through the stored input 0-coordinates `(r, c)`: Replace the value at `(r, c)` in the output grid with 6.
        b.  Iterate through the stored input 0-coordinates `(r, c)` again: Set the value at `(r, c+1)` in the output grid to 0 (ensure `c+1` is within grid bounds).
        c.  Iterate through each row index `r` of the input grid:
            i.  Check if the input row `r` contains the sequence `[0, 6, 0]`.
            ii. If it does, define the column range `c_start = c5 + 2` to `c_end = c5 + 5`.
            iii.Fill the cells in the output grid with 2s for row `r` in the column range `[c_start, c_end]` (inclusive, checking bounds).
            iv. Fill the cells in the output grid with 2s for row `r+1` in the column range `[c_start, c_end]` (inclusive, checking bounds).
    6.  **If `pattern_found` is false:**
        a.  Replace all cells with value 0 in the output grid with 6.
        b.  Identify all distinct contiguous regions (shapes) of 0s from the *original* input grid. Assume exactly two shapes are found.
        c.  Determine the bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) for each shape.
        d.  Identify 'Shape 1' as the shape whose bounding box has the smaller minimum row index. Let its bounding box be `(r1_min, c1_min, r1_max, c1_max)`.
        e.  Identify 'Shape 2' as the other shape. Let its bounding box be `(r2_min, c2_min, r2_max, c2_max)`.
        f.  Calculate the coordinates for the output rectangle:
            i.  `top_row = c1_min`
            ii. `bottom_row = r1_max`
            iii. `left_col = r2_min + 1`
            iv. `right_col = r2_max + 1`
        g.  Fill all cells within the calculated rectangle (from `top_row` to `bottom_row` inclusive, and from `left_col` to `right_col` inclusive) in the output grid with the value 2 (checking bounds).
    7.  Ensure the marker line (value 5) is correctly preserved in the output grid (it should be, as the modifications target 0s or specific calculated regions).
    8.  Return the final output grid.
