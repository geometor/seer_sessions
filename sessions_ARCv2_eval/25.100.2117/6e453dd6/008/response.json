            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The previous code failed primarily because it incorrectly identified the core conditional logic. The assumption that the transformation hinged solely on the *number* of 0-shapes (2 vs. not 2) was wrong, leading to incorrect handling of Example 1. The subsequent analysis revealed a more complex set of prioritized conditions:\n    1.  Presence of a \"long pattern\" (`0, 6, 6+, 0`).\n    2.  If no long pattern, a specific condition for inputs with exactly 2 shapes, both containing a short pattern (`0, 6, 0`).\n    3.  If neither of the above, a condition based on short patterns (`0, 6, 0`) starting at `c > 0` and vertical connectivity.\n\n    The core transformation common to all cases seems to be shifting the 0-blocks right by one column. The differences lie entirely in how and where the '2' values are placed based on the prioritized conditions met by the *input* grid.\n\n    The previous code correctly identified the rules for placing '2's in the \"long pattern\" case (Subcase B1, Example 3) and the \"short pattern with connectivity\" case (Subcase B2, Example 2). The main error was applying the wrong logic to Example 1 and incorrectly implementing the block shift and the Case A logic.\n\n*   **Strategy:**\n    1.  Implement the universal block shift logic correctly.\n    2.  Implement the prioritized conditional checks for placing '2's:\n        *   Check for long patterns first. If found, apply Example 3's '2' placement rule.\n        *   If no long patterns, check if the input has exactly 2 shapes AND both contain the `(0, 6, 0)` pattern. If yes, apply Example 1's '2' placement rule (needs careful definition, especially the `r=4` start row for the first block).\n        *   If neither of the above, apply Example 2's '2' placement rule (check for `(0, 6, 0)` at `c>0` and vertical connectivity).\n    3.  Refine helper functions for pattern detection, shape analysis, and connectivity as needed. Use code execution to verify properties under the new hypothesis.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n\n    *code_execution:*\n    "

Keep track of the set of coordinates for each shape. Create a mapping from each 0-coordinate `(r, c)` to the unique ID of the shape it belongs to.\n        b.  Find the column index (`marker_col`) of the vertical line of 5s.\n        c.  Determine the grid `height` and `width`.\n\n    2.  **Initialize Output and Shift Blocks:**\n        a.  Create the `output_grid` as a deep copy of the `input_grid`.\n        b.  Collect all coordinates `(r, c)` that contain 0 in the `input_grid`.\n        c.  Iterate through these original 0-coordinates: Set `output_grid[r][c] = 6`.\n        d.  Iterate through these original 0-coordinates again: If `c + 1` is less than `width`, set `output_grid[r][c + 1] = 0`. (This completes the rightward block shift).\n\n    3.  **Determine and Apply '2' Placement Rule (Prioritized):**\n\n        a.  **Check Condition B1 (Long Pattern):** Does any row in the *input grid* contain the pattern `(0, 6, 6+, 0)` (a 0, at least two 6s, then a 0)?\n            i.  **If YES:** Find all row indices `r` in the *input grid* that contain *any* pattern `(0, 6+, 0)`. For each such unique row index `r`, fill the `output_grid` cells from column `marker_col + 1` to `width - 1` (inclusive) in that row `r` with the value 2. Proceed to Step 4.\n\n        b.  **Check Condition A (2 Shapes with Short Patterns):** If Condition B1 is NOT met, does the *input grid* contain exactly two 0-shapes, AND does each of these two shapes contain at least one instance of the pattern `(0, 6, 0)` within its coordinates?\n            i.  **If YES:**\n                *   Identify the two shapes; let `Shape1` be the one with the smaller minimum row index (`r_min`) and `Shape2` be the other. Calculate their bounding boxes: `Bbox1` and `Bbox2`.\n                *   Find the list of row indices (`R2_rows`) within `Shape2` that contain the `(0, 6, 0)` pattern (where the 0s are part of `Shape2`).\n                *   Fill the first block of 2s: In the `output_grid`, fill cells with 2 from row 4 to `Bbox1.rmax` (inclusive), and from column `marker_col + 1` to `marker_col + 4` (inclusive), respecting grid boundaries.\n                *   Fill the second block of 2s: In the `output_grid`, fill cells with 2 from row `min(R2_rows)` to `Bbox2.rmax` (inclusive), and from column `marker_col + 1` to `marker_col + 4` (inclusive), respecting grid boundaries.\n                *   Proceed to Step 4.\n\n        c.  **Apply Condition B2 (Connectivity Check):** If neither Condition B1 nor Condition A is met:\n            i.  Find all row indices `r` in the *input grid* where the pattern `(0, 6, 0)` occurs starting at a column `c` such that `c > 0`.\n            ii. For each such row `r`, check if any of the 0s involved in these specific pattern instances (at `c` and `c+2`) belong to the same shape as *any* 0 in the row below (`r+1`), using the shape map created in Step 1a.\n            iii.Identify the unique set of row indices `r` for which this vertical connection exists.\n            iv. For each unique row index `r` in this set, fill the `output_grid` cells from column `marker_col + 1` to `width - 1` (inclusive) in that row `r` with the value 2.\n\n    4.  **Return** the final `output_grid`."
