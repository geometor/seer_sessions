The input grid primarily consists of the number 6, with some scattered 0s forming distinct shapes and a single vertical line of 5s. The output grid retains the background 6s and the line of 5s but replaces the 0s. A new rectangular area filled with 2s appears in the output. The transformation seems to involve identifying the shapes formed by the 0s in the input, removing them (filling with 6s), and then using properties (like bounding box coordinates) of these shapes to determine the location and size of the new rectangle of 2s in the output.\n\n*   **Observed Facts:**\n\n    "
