**Refined Perception**

This third example (`train_3`) significantly refines the understanding of the transformation.

1.  **Background Identification:** Confirmed: The background is the most frequent color (value '3' in this case).
2.  **Static Elements:** The isolated '2' at `(0, 4)` remains unchanged. This strengthens the hypothesis that certain specific values might be inherently static, regardless of neighbors. Value '2' seems static here. Comparing across examples: '4' was static in `train_1` (as a single cell), '6' and '1' were static in `train_2` (as non-pattern elements), '2' is static in `train_3` (isolated). Single-cell components also seem static (the '4' in `train_1`).
3.  **Moving Elements:** The patterns involving '1's (and an embedded '2') are clusters or connected components. These components shift horizontally.
4.  **Transformation Rule - Major Update:** The nature of the shift seems to depend on the overall structure present in the grid.
    *   **Component-Based Shift (Mode A):** Examples `train_1` and `train_3` follow this mode. Connected components of non-background colors (potentially excluding inherently static values like '2') are identified. Single-cell components are static. Multi-cell components undergo a horizontal shift. Crucially, the *magnitude and direction* of the shift depend on the component's **leftmost column index**, and this relationship (leftmost column -> shift amount) appears to be defined *per example* based on all moving components within that example.
        *   `train_1`: Rule {leftmost col 1: shift +3, leftmost col 4: shift -1}
        *   `train_3`: Rule {leftmost col 1: shift +2, leftmost col 3: shift -3, leftmost col 4: shift -1}
    *   **Pattern-Based Shift (Mode B):** Example `train_2` follows this mode. Specific, local multi-cell patterns are identified (vertical column, 3/1 block, etc.). Each recognized pattern type has a fixed shift vector (which can be 2D). Cells not part of a recognized moving pattern remain static.
5.  **Mode Selection:** The task likely involves first checking if Mode B patterns exist. If yes, apply Mode B rules. If no such specific patterns are found, apply Mode A rules.

**Updated Facts**


```yaml
Grid:
  Dimensions: Variable
  Values: Integers

Identification:
  BackgroundValueDetermination: Most frequent color in the input grid.
    - train_1: 1
    - train_2: 8
    - train_3: 3
  ForegroundValues: All values not equal to the BackgroundValue.
  StaticValueCandidates:
    # Hypothesis: Specific values might be inherently static.
    - Value '2': Static in train_3 (0, 4).
  StaticComponentRule:
    # Hypothesis: Single-cell connected components of non-background, non-static values are static.
    - Example: train_1, single '4' at (17, 5).

TransformationMode:
  # Hypothesis: Task operates in one of two modes per example, selected based on pattern presence.
  - Mode A (Component Shift): Default mode if Mode B patterns are absent.
    - Triggered by: Examples like train_1, train_3.
    - Process:
      1. Identify potentially static values (e.g., '2') and mark them processed.
      2. Find connected components of remaining non-background cells.
      3. Single-cell components are static. Mark and copy them.
      4. Multi-cell components shift horizontally.
      5. Derive shift rule `map(LeftmostColumn -> HorizontalShift)` by comparing input/output positions of all multi-cell components *within the specific example*.
         - train_1 rule: {1: +3, 4: -1}
         - train_3 rule: {1: +2, 3: -3, 4: -1}
      6. Apply shift to each multi-cell component based on its leftmost column and the derived rule. Mark cells processed.
    - Affected Components (Examples):
      - train_1: Object 1 (LM=1, Shift=+3), Object 2 (LM=4, Shift=-1), Object 3 (LM=1, Shift=+3). Object 4 (single '4') static by single-cell rule.
      - train_3: Component 1 (LM=1, Shift=+2), Component 2 (LM=3, Shift=-3), Component 3 (LM=4, Shift=-1). Isolated '2' static by value rule.

  - Mode B (Pattern Matching): Applies if specific complex local patterns are present.
    - Triggered by: Examples like train_2.
    - Process:
      1. Identify potentially static values (e.g., '2' if present) and mark them processed.
      2. Identify all instances of known specific patterns among remaining non-background cells.
      3. Apply the fixed transformation (shift vector) associated with each pattern type. Mark cells processed.
      4. Remaining unprocessed non-background cells are static. Copy them.
    - Pattern -> Transformation Mapping (Observed in train_2):
      - Vertical column (4s, maybe 6s): Shift (rows=+2, cols=0)
      - 3x3 block (3s around 1): Shift (rows=-1, cols=-1)
      - Horizontal `3 3 3`: Shift (rows=-3, cols=0)
      - Horizontal `3 1 3 3`: Shift (rows=-2, cols=0)
    - Static Leftovers (Example train_2): '6' at (8,0), '1' at (4,1).

OutputConstruction:
  - Initialize output grid with BackgroundValue.
  - Process cells according to the selected Mode (A or B), applying static rules and calculated shifts, copying values to the output grid.

**Updated Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialization:**
    a.  Determine input grid dimensions (H, W).
    b.  Find the background color `B` (most frequent value).
    c.  Create an HxW output grid filled with `B`.
    d.  Create an HxW boolean grid `processed_cells`, initialized to `False`.

2.  **Identify and Handle Inherently Static Values:**
    a.  Define a set of values known to be static (e.g., `{2}` based on `train_3`).
    b.  Iterate through the input grid. If `input[r, c]` is in the static set:
        i.  Copy `input[r, c]` to `output[r, c]`.
        ii. Mark `processed_cells[r, c]` as `True`.

3.  **Prepare Candidate Cells:** Create a list of coordinates `(r, c)` for all cells where `input[r, c]` is not `B` and `processed_cells[r, c]` is `False`.

4.  **Determine Transformation Mode:**
    a.  Scan the input grid for known specific patterns (like those in `train_2`) composed of candidate cells.
    b.  **If** Mode B patterns are found: Proceed to Step 5 (Mode B).
    c.  **Else:** Proceed to Step 6 (Mode A).

5.  **Mode B - Pattern Matching Transformation:**
    a.  Define a library of known patterns and their fixed shift vectors `(dr, dc)`.
    b.  For each pattern type in the library:
        i.  Find all non-overlapping instances in the input using candidate cells.
        ii. For each instance: Mark the cells `(r, c)` within it as processed (`processed_cells[r, c] = True`) and copy `input[r, c]` to `output[r + dr, c + dc]` (checking bounds).
    c.  **Handle Leftovers:** Iterate through the initial `candidate_cells`. If `processed_cells[r, c]` is still `False`:
        i.  Copy `input[r, c]` to `output[r, c]` (treat as static).
        ii. Mark `processed_cells[r, c]` as `True`.
    d.  Skip to Step 7.

6.  **Mode A - Component Shift Transformation:**
    a.  Find all connected components using the `candidate_cells`.
    b.  Separate components into `single_cell_components` and `multi_cell_components`.
    c.  **Handle Static Single Cells:** For each component `comp` (containing cell `(r, c)`) in `single_cell_components`:
        i.  Copy `input[r, c]` to `output[r, c]`.
        ii. Mark `processed_cells[r, c]` as `True`.
    d.  **Derive Shift Rule (Requires Example Output):**
        i.  If `multi_cell_components` is empty, skip to Step 6f.
        ii. Create an empty dictionary `shift_rule`.
        iii. **Crucially, analyze the provided example output grid** to find the corresponding output location for *each* component in `multi_cell_components`.
        iv. For each input component `comp_in` and its corresponding output component `comp_out`:
            - Find the leftmost column `L_in` of `comp_in`.
            - Find the leftmost column `L_out` of `comp_out`.
            - Calculate horizontal shift `S = L_out - L_in`.
            - Store `shift_rule[L_in] = S`.
    e.  **Apply Shifts:** For each component `comp` in `multi_cell_components`:
        i.  Find its leftmost column `L_in`.
        ii. Get the shift `S` from `shift_rule` based on `L_in` (default to 0 if not found).
        iii. For each cell `(r, c)` in `comp`:
            - Calculate target `tc = c + S`.
            - If `(r, tc)` is within bounds: Copy `input[r, c]` to `output[r, tc]`.
            - Mark `processed_cells[r, c]` as `True`.
    f.  **Handle Leftovers (Fallback):** Iterate through `candidate_cells`. If `processed_cells[r, c]` is still `False`: Copy `input[r, c]` to `output[r, c]`.

7.  **Return Output:** Return the completed output grid.
