            "text": "**Refined Perception**\n\nThis third example (`train_3`) significantly refines the understanding of the transformation.\n\n1.  **Background Identification:** Confirmed: The background is the most frequent color (value '3' in this case).\n2.  **Static Elements:** The isolated '2' at `(0, 4)` remains unchanged. This strengthens the hypothesis that certain specific values might be inherently static, regardless of neighbors. Value '2' seems static here. Comparing across examples: '4' was static in `train_1` (as a single cell), '6' and '1' were static in `train_2` (as non-pattern elements), '2' is static in `train_3` (isolated). Single-cell components also seem static (the '4' in `train_1`).\n3.  **Moving Elements:** The patterns involving '1's (and an embedded '2') are clusters or connected components. These components shift horizontally.\n4.  **Transformation Rule - Major Update:** The nature of the shift seems to depend on the overall structure present in the grid.\n    *   **Component-Based Shift (Mode A):** Examples `train_1` and `train_3` follow this mode. Connected components of non-background colors (potentially excluding inherently static values like '2') are identified. Single-cell components are static. Multi-cell components undergo a horizontal shift. Crucially, the *magnitude and direction* of the shift depend on the component's **leftmost column index**, and this relationship (leftmost column -> shift amount) appears to be defined *per example* based on all moving components within that example.\n        *   `train_1`: Rule {leftmost col 1: shift +3, leftmost col 4: shift -1}\n        *   `train_3`: Rule {leftmost col 1: shift +2, leftmost col 3: shift -3, leftmost col 4: shift -1}\n    *   **Pattern-Based Shift (Mode B):** Example `train_2` follows this mode. Specific, local multi-cell patterns are identified (vertical column, 3/1 block, etc.). Each recognized pattern type has a fixed shift vector (which can be 2D). Cells not part of a recognized moving pattern remain static.\n5.  **Mode Selection:** The task likely involves first checking if Mode B patterns exist. If yes, apply Mode B rules. If no such specific patterns are found, apply Mode A rules.\n\n**Updated Facts**\n\n"
