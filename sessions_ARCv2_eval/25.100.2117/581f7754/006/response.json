            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the task by implementing a two-mode approach: Mode A (Component Shift) for examples like `train_1` and `train_3`, and Mode B (Pattern Matching) for examples like `train_2`. The mode selection heuristic (based on the presence of foreground color '3') correctly categorizes the training examples.\n\n*   **Mode A:** The code successfully solved `train_1`. It failed on `train_3` in the initial run because it incorrectly treated the value '2' as inherently static, even when part of a larger component. The logic presented in the *final code listing* appears to correct this by only treating single-cell components as static. Assuming this correction works, Mode A seems reasonably well-defined: multi-cell non-background components shift horizontally based on their leftmost column, with the shift rule dependent on the grid's background color.\n*   **Mode B:** The code failed significantly on `train_2`. While it correctly identified and transformed some specific patterns (like the vertical column and the `3 1 3 3` sequence), its handling of other patterns (like `3 3 3` and the 3x3 block) and the remaining 'fallback' cells did not match the expected output. The interaction and precedence of patterns, along with the behavior of non-pattern foreground cells, are complex in `train_2`. The current pattern-matching logic and static fallback are insufficient.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Validate Mode A:** Confirm that the corrected Mode A logic (static only for single-cell components) produces the correct output for `train_3`.\n2.  **Refine Mode B:**\n    *   Maintain the detection of specific, clearly defined patterns with fixed shifts (Vertical column, 3x3 block, `3 1 3 3`). Ensure the pattern detection prevents overlaps correctly (e.g., a cell cannot belong to two shifted patterns). Processing larger patterns first might help.\n    *   Re-evaluate the `3 3 3` pattern rule, as it seemed inconsistent in `train_2`. It might be context-dependent or require a different shift. Given the complexity, removing this specific rule and letting those cells fall into the static fallback might be more robust.\n    *   Implement a clearer static fallback: After applying all confirmed pattern shifts and marking processed cells, iterate through *all* original foreground cells. If a cell `(r, c)` was *not* processed as part of a shifted pattern, place its value `input[r, c]` into the output grid at `output[r, c]`, *only if* that position hasn't already been filled by a shifted element. This ensures that isolated cells and non-pattern shapes remain in place relative to the grid unless overwritten.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nBased on the final test run provided:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Mode: A (Background=1)\n    *   Pixels Off: 0\n    *   Result: Correct.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Mode: B (Background=8, Foreground '3' present)\n    *   Pixels Off: 28\n    *   Result: Incorrect. Errors primarily involve misplaced '3's and '1's that were not part of the correctly identified vertical column, 3x3 block, or `3 1 3 3` patterns. The handling of overlapping patterns or the static fallback logic needs significant revision. The `[[3,3,3]]` pattern rule application appears problematic.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Mode: A (Background=3)\n    *   Pixels Off: 22\n    *   Result: Incorrect. However, based on manual analysis, the Mode A logic described in the *final code version* (static only for single cells) *should* produce the correct output. The reported \"Transformed Output\" likely corresponds to an earlier code version where '2' was treated as inherently static. The errors listed (e.g., '2' at (5,2) not shifting to (5,4)) directly align with this incorrect static '2' assumption.\n\n**Updated Facts**\n\n"
