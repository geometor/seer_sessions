            "text": "**Refined Perception**\n\nBased on the two examples, the task involves transforming an input grid to an output grid of the same dimensions. The transformation operates on distinct \"objects\" or \"patterns\" composed of specific colors that stand out against a dominant \"background\" color.\n\n1.  **Background Identification:** The background color appears to be the most frequent color in the input grid (1 in `train_1`, 8 in `train_2`).\n2.  **Object/Pattern Identification:** Objects are formed by connected components of non-background colors, OR they might be specific, predefined local patterns involving one or more non-background colors. Different types of patterns exist across the examples.\n3.  **Transformation Rules:** The core transformation involves applying a specific rule based on the *type* of object or pattern identified:\n    *   Some simple patterns (like isolated single cells of certain colors) remain static.\n    *   Other patterns undergo geometric translations (shifts). These shifts can be horizontal (`train_1`) or vertical (`train_2`), or a combination (`train_2`, 3x3 block).\n    *   The direction and magnitude of the shift depend on the specific pattern type and sometimes its location (e.g., leftmost column in `train_1`).\n    *   In `train_2`, different sub-patterns within a larger connected component of non-background colors appear to move independently according to different rules, suggesting the transformation might prioritize recognizing specific local arrangements over larger connected components.\n4.  **Output Construction:** The output grid is constructed by placing the transformed (shifted or static) patterns onto a grid initialized with the identified background color. The relative positions of cells *within* a shifting pattern are preserved during the shift.\n\nThe key challenge lies in correctly identifying the relevant patterns/objects and mapping each type to its corresponding transformation rule (static, specific shift vector). The rules seem quite specific to the visual structure of the patterns.\n\n**Updated Facts**\n\n"

Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the determined background color.\n3.  Identify all instances of predefined foreground patterns in the input grid. These patterns may involve specific colors and spatial arrangements. Potential pattern types include (but may not be limited to):\n    *   Isolated single non-background cells.\n    *   3x3-like clusters of specific values (e.g., 8s around a 4).\n    *   Vertical segments of specific values (e.g., 4s and 6s).\n    *   Specific arrangements involving 3s and 1s (e.g., 3x3 blocks, horizontal lines).\n4.  For each identified pattern instance:\n    a.  Determine the pattern type.\n    b.  Apply the transformation rule associated with that pattern type:\n        *   **Static Rule:** If the pattern type is designated as static (e.g., isolated single cells like '4' in train_1, '6' at (8,0) in train_2, '1' at (4,1) in train_2), copy the pattern's cells directly to the corresponding positions in the output grid.\n        *   **Shift Rule:** If the pattern type has a shift rule:\n            i.  Determine the shift vector (delta_row, delta_col). This vector might be fixed for the pattern type (e.g., (2, 0) for vertical column, (-1, -1) for 3x3 block, (-3, 0) for `3 3 3`, (-2, 0) for `3 1 3 3`) or depend on the pattern's position (e.g., (+0, +3) or (+0, -1) for 3x3-like cluster based on leftmost column).\n            ii. For each cell `(r, c)` belonging to the pattern instance in the input grid, copy its value to the location `(r + delta_row, c + delta_col)` in the output grid, overwriting any background value previously placed there. Ensure the target coordinates are within the grid boundaries.\n5.  Return the completed output grid. (Note: Address potential overlaps - if multiple patterns dictate a value for the same output cell, a precedence rule might be needed, though observed examples suggest overwriting the initial background fill is sufficient)."
