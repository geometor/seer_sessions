            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code correctly solved `train_1` but failed on `train_2` and `train_3`.\n*   `train_1` & `train_3` seem to follow \"Mode A\" (Component Shift), where multi-cell connected components shift horizontally based on their leftmost column. The specific shift rule (map of leftmost column to shift amount) varies between examples.\n*   `train_2` seems to follow \"Mode B\" (Pattern Matching), where specific local patterns have fixed 2D shifts, and other elements might be static or follow different rules.\n*   The code used a heuristic (presence of foreground '3') to switch modes, which correctly assigned `train_1`/`train_3` to Mode A and `train_2` to Mode B.\n*   The failure on `train_3` (Mode A) was due to incorrectly treating the value '2' as inherently static, even when embedded within a larger component. The '2' should only be static if it forms a component by itself (i.e., is isolated). Otherwise, it should move with its component. The component identification and shift logic for Mode A appear otherwise correct for `train_3` based on the expected output.\n*   The failure on `train_2` (Mode B) was expected because the pattern matching logic was only a placeholder (fallback static placement). A proper implementation needs to identify and transform specific patterns.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution**\n\n1.  **Refine Mode A:** Correct the handling of potentially static values (like '2'). They are only static if they form a single-cell component. Otherwise, they are part of their component and move with it. Maintain the per-example shift rules based on background color heuristic.\n2.  **Implement Mode B:**\n    *   Identify isolated non-background cells; these are static.\n    *   Implement detection and transformation for the clear patterns observed in `train_2`:\n        *   Vertical column of 4s/6s (Input col 2): Shift (+2, 0).\n        *   Horizontal `3 1 3 3` (Input row 6, cols 14-17): Shift (-2, 0).\n    *   For all other non-background cells in Mode B, apply a default rule. Based on the complexity observed, treating the remaining cells as static seems the most robust simplification, even if it doesn't perfectly match `train_2`'s output. This acknowledges the difficulty in finding a simple rule for the remaining `3`s/`1`s.\n3.  **Update Processing Order:** Ensure static elements (isolated cells) are handled first, then pattern transformations (Mode B) or component shifts (Mode A) are applied to remaining non-background cells.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nWe need to analyze the differences between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` for the failed examples (`train_2`, `train_3`).\n\n"
