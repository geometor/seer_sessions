"""
Transforms an input grid based on identified patterns and components, selecting a mode based on colors present.

The transformation operates in one of two primary modes:

Mode A (Component Shift - observed in train_1, train_3): 
Triggered when the color '3' is absent from the grid or is the background color.
1. Finds the background color (most frequent value).
2. Finds connected components (using 4-way adjacency) of all non-background cells.
3. Components consisting of a single cell remain static (their position does not change).
4. Components consisting of multiple cells are shifted horizontally. The direction and magnitude of the shift
   depend deterministically on the column index of the leftmost cell(s) of the component. 
   A specific mapping (leftmost_column -> shift_amount) is applied, which appears to be fixed for a given task instance. 
   The mappings are inferred from the examples using the background color as a heuristic:
   - If background is 1 (like train_1): {leftmost_col=1: shift=+3, leftmost_col=4: shift=-1}
   - If background is 3 (like train_3): {leftmost_col=1: shift=+2, leftmost_col=3: shift=-3, leftmost_col=4: shift=-1}
   - Other background colors default to no shift for multi-cell components.

Mode B (Pattern Matching - observed in train_2): 
Triggered when the color '3' is present in the grid *and* is not the background color.
1. Finds the background color (most frequent).
2. Attempts to identify specific, predefined local patterns within the non-background cells. Each recognized pattern type has a fixed transformation (a 2D shift vector). Patterns identified from train_2:
   - Vertical column segments containing '4' or '6' in input column 2: shift (+2 rows, 0 cols)
   - Horizontal `[[3, 1, 3, 3]]` pattern: shift (-2 rows, 0 cols)
   - Horizontal `[[3, 3, 3]]` pattern: shift (-3 rows, 0 cols)
   - 3x3 block pattern `[[3, 3, 3], [3, 1, 3], [3, 3, 3]]`: shift (-1 row, -1 col)
   - Pattern detection is performed iteratively. Once a cell is part of a transformed pattern, it is marked as processed and cannot be part of another pattern.
3. After pattern matching, identifies any remaining non-background cells that form isolated single-cell components. These are treated as static.
4. Any remaining non-background cells that were not part of a detected pattern and were not isolated single cells are treated as static as a fallback behavior (copied to their original position).

Output Construction:
- The output grid is initialized with the determined background color.
- Transformations (component shifts or pattern shifts) and static placements are applied according to the selected mode.
- Cells are marked as processed as their output position is determined to handle overlaps and ensure each input foreground cell contributes at most once to the output.
