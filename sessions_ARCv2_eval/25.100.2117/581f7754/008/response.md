**General Assessment**

The provided code implements a two-mode strategy (Mode A: Component Shift, Mode B: Pattern Matching) based on the presence of foreground color '3'. Mode A appears correctly implemented in the final code description, successfully solving `train_1` and likely capable of solving `train_3` (the reported failure seems based on an older code version). Mode B, however, struggles with `train_2`. While it correctly identifies and transforms some specific patterns, it fails to capture the full complexity of the transformations within `train_2`, leading to significant errors. The primary challenge lies in completely defining the set of patterns and rules governing Mode B, or potentially reconsidering the fundamental logic for grids containing foreground '3's. The static fallback in Mode B also needs refinement.

**Strategy for Resolution**

1.  **Confirm Mode A:** Assume the final documented Mode A logic (static only for *single-cell* components, shift determined by leftmost column and background color) is correct. This should resolve the `train_3` errors reported previously.
2.  **Refine Mode B:**
    *   **Expand Pattern Library:** Analyze `train_2`'s input/output diff more closely to identify *all* distinct moving patterns and their corresponding shifts. The current library (`Vertical Column`, `3x3 Block`, `3 1 3 3`) is incomplete. The simple horizontal `[[3,3,3]]` rule seems incorrect or insufficient. New potential patterns/rules might be needed (e.g., for the `3`s/`1`s cluster near the center).
    *   **Improve Overlap/Precedence:** Define a clear order for pattern matching (e.g., larger/more specific patterns first) and ensure the `processed_mask` correctly prevents cells from being used in multiple conflicting transformations.
    *   **Refine Static Fallback:** The current fallback (copying unprocessed foreground cells to their original location) seems correct *in principle*. However, if the pattern matching misses transformations, too many cells will incorrectly fall back to being static. The core issue remains accurately identifying *which* cells should move according to which pattern.

**Metrics Gathering**

Based on the final execution results provided:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Mode Triggered: A (Background=1, No Fgnd '3')
    *   Result: Match: True, Pixels Off: 0
    *   Assessment: Correctly solved by Mode A.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Mode Triggered: B (Background=8, Fgnd '3' Present)
    *   Result: Match: False, Pixels Off: 29
    *   Assessment: Incorrect. The Mode B pattern library and/or fallback logic is insufficient. Key errors involve the large central cluster of '3's and '1's, where several sub-patterns seem to move independently or according to rules not captured by the code. The code correctly handles the vertical column, the `3 1 3 3` pattern, and the *first* 3x3 block, but fails on other parts of the central cluster and potentially the static fallback for some cells.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Mode Triggered: A (Background=3, No Fgnd '3')
    *   Result: Match: False, Pixels Off: 22
    *   Assessment: Incorrect, *but* the reported "Transformed Output" strongly suggests it was generated by code that incorrectly treated the '2's as *inherently* static. The final documented code corrects this (static only for single-cell components). It's highly probable the *final* code logic would solve this example correctly.

**Updated Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialization:**
    a.  Determine the input grid dimensions (H, W).
    b.  Find the background color `B` (most frequent value).
    c.  Create an HxW output grid filled with `B`.
    d.  Identify all non-background (foreground) cells.

2.  **Determine Mode:** Check if the value '3' exists among the foreground cells.
    *   If '3' is *not* a foreground color, proceed to **Step 3 (Mode A)**.
    *   If '3' *is* a foreground color, proceed to **Step 4 (Mode B)**.

3.  **Mode A: Component Shift Transformation:**
    a.  Find all connected components (using 4-way adjacency) of foreground cells.
    b.  Define the horizontal shift rule map based on the background color `B`:
        *   Rule for `B=1`: `{1: 3, 4: -1}`
        *   Rule for `B=3`: `{1: 2, 3: -3, 4: -1}`
        *   Default Rule (other `B`): `{}` (no shift)
    c.  For each component:
        i.  If the component contains only one cell `(r, c)`: Place `input[r, c]` at `output[r, c]`.
        ii. If the component contains multiple cells:
            - Find the leftmost column index `L`.
            - Get the horizontal shift amount `S` from the corresponding rule map using `L` (default to 0 if `L` not in map or no map defined).
            - For each cell `(r, c)` in the component, calculate the target column `nc = c + S`. If `(r, nc)` is within grid bounds, place `input[r, c]` at `output[r, nc]`.
    d.  Proceed to Step 5.

4.  **Mode B: Pattern Matching Transformation:**
    a.  Create an HxW boolean mask `processed_cells`, initialized to `False`.
    b.  **Apply Pattern Shifts (Order: Vertical, 3x3, 3133):**
        i.  **Vertical Column:** Iterate through rows `r`. If `input[r, 2]` is 4 or 6 AND `processed_cells[r, 2]` is `False`: Calculate target `(nr, nc) = (r + 2, 2)`. If within bounds, set `output[nr, nc] = input[r, 2]` and set `processed_cells[r, 2] = True`.
        ii. **3x3 Block:** Iterate through possible top-left corners `(r, c)`. Check if the `input[r:r+3, c:c+3]` matches the `[[3,3,3],[3,1,3],[3,3,3]]` pattern AND if *none* of the 9 cells in `processed_cells[r:r+3, c:c+3]` are `True`. If both conditions met: For each `(pr, pc)` from (0,0) to (2,2), calculate target `(nr, nc) = (r+pr-1, c+pc-1)`. If within bounds, set `output[nr, nc] = input[r+pr, c+pc]` and set `processed_cells[r+pr, c+pc] = True`.
        iii. **Horizontal `3 1 3 3`:** Iterate through possible positions `(r, c)`. Check if `input[r, c:c+4]` matches `[3, 1, 3, 3]` AND if *none* of the 4 cells in `processed_cells[r, c:c+4]` are `True`. If both conditions met: For each `pc` from 0 to 3, calculate target `(nr, nc) = (r-2, c+pc)`. If within bounds, set `output[nr, nc] = input[r, c+pc]` and set `processed_cells[r, c+pc] = True`.
    c.  **Static Fallback:** Iterate through all input grid coordinates `(r, c)`.
        i.  If `input[r, c]` is not the background color `B` AND `processed_cells[r, c]` is `False`:
            - Place `input[r, c]` at `output[r, c]`.
    d.  Proceed to Step 5.

5.  **Return Output:** Return the completed output grid.
