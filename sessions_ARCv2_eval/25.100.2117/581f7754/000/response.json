The value '1' appears to function as a background color or empty space. The values '4' and '8' form distinct shapes or objects within the grid.\n\nThe core transformation seems to involve identifying these objects (composed of 4s and 8s) and shifting them horizontally. There appear to be multiple distinct objects in the input. Most objects are shifted, but one object (a single '4') remains in its original position. The direction and magnitude of the shift seem to vary between the objects that do move. Specifically, two objects shift right by 3 columns, and one object shifts left by 1 column. The background '1's remain unchanged in their positions relative to the grid boundaries.\n\n**Observed Facts**\n\n"
