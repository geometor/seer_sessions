TransformationRule:
  - Identify connected components (objects) composed of values other than 1.
  - For each object:
    - If the object consists of a single cell with value 4, it remains unchanged.
    - Otherwise, determine the object's leftmost column index (0-based).
    - If the leftmost column index is 1, shift the entire object 3 columns to the right.
    - If the leftmost column index is 4, shift the entire object 1 column to the left.
  - The background (value 1) remains unchanged.
  - Construct the output grid by placing the transformed (or unchanged) objects onto a background of 1s.
