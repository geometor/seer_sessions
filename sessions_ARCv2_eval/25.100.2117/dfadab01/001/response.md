## Refined Perception

Based on the two examples provided (`train_1` and `train_2`), the task involves transforming an input grid of digits into an output grid of digits. The grid dimensions can vary (20x20 in `train_1`, 10x10 in `train_2`). The transformation identifies specific digits or patterns of digits in the input and generates corresponding, often larger or shifted, patterns in the output grid using potentially different digits. The background remains '0'.

Key transformations observed across examples:

1.  **Digit '2'**: Consistently maps to a 4x4 hollow square using digit '4' in the output, anchored at the input '2's location. (Seen in `train_1`, `train_2`)
2.  **2x2 Block of '6's**: Maps to a 2x2 block of '6's in the output, shifted one cell up and one cell left relative to the input block's top-left corner. (Seen in `train_1`)
3.  **'5'/'3' Rectangle**: A specific rectangular arrangement of '5's (top row) and '3's (bottom row) generates four distinct 2x2 blocks of '6's in the output, positioned relative to the corners of the input rectangle (top corners match, bottom corners shift up by 3 rows). (Seen in `train_1`)
4.  **Digit '3' (Conditional)**: The behavior associated with '3' appears context-dependent and potentially generates a 4x4 hollow square using digit '1'.
    *   If there exists at least one *vertical pair* of '3's in the input grid that are *not* part of a '5'/'3' rectangle, locate the pair with the lowest bottom-row index. Generate the output square anchored at the position of the *lower* '3' of this specific pair. (Rule derived from `train_1`)
    *   If *no* such vertical pair exists, find the '3' in the input grid with the minimum row index (and minimum column index in case of a tie). If this '3' is *not* part of a '5'/'3' rectangle, generate the output square anchored at this '3's position. (Rule derived from `train_2`)
5.  **Hollow Square of '1's**: A 4x4 hollow square made of '1's in the input maps to an identical 4x4 hollow square of '1's in the output, shifted one column to the right relative to the input square's top-left corner. (Seen in `train_2`)

The generation rules appear independent, and their outputs are overlaid onto the initial zero-filled output grid without overwriting each other in the examples seen.

## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros.
2.  Identify all input cells (r, c) containing the digit '2'. For each such cell, draw a 4x4 hollow square (perimeter filled, interior zero/empty) in the output grid using the digit '4', with the top-left corner at (r, c).
3.  Identify all input cells (r, c) that are the top-left corner of a 2x2 block filled entirely with '6'. For each such cell, fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at position (r-1, c-1).
4.  Identify all input cells (r, c) that are the top-left corner of a 4x4 hollow square filled with '1's. For each such cell, draw a 4x4 hollow square in the output grid using the digit '1', with the top-left corner at (r, c+1).
5.  Identify all sets of four input cells P1=(r1, c1), P2=(r1, c2), P3=(r2, c1), P4=(r2, c2) such that r1 < r2, c1 < c2, the digit at P1 and P2 is '5', and the digit at P3 and P4 is '3' (let these be "FiveThreeRectangles").
    a.  For each such set found:
        i.  Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at P1=(r1, c1).
        ii. Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at P2=(r1, c2).
        iii. Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at (r2-3, c1).
        iv. Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at (r2-3, c2).
    b.  Keep track of the coordinates of all '3's that are part of any identified FiveThreeRectangle.
6.  Process the digit '3' to potentially generate a single '1' square:
    a.  Create a list of all '3' locations in the input grid that were *not* identified as part of a FiveThreeRectangle in step 5b (`EligibleThrees`).
    b.  Search `EligibleThrees` for vertical pairs: locations (r_a, c) and (r_b, c) where r_a < r_b.
    c.  If one or more vertical pairs are found: Identify the pair where the lower '3' (r_b, c) has the minimum row index `r_b` across all found pairs. Let the trigger location be this specific (r_b, c).
    d.  If no vertical pairs are found in `EligibleThrees`: Find the location (r_min, c_min) in `EligibleThrees` that has the minimum row index `r_min`. If there are ties for `r_min`, choose the one with the minimum column index `c_min`. Let the trigger location be this (r_min, c_min).
    e.  If a trigger location (r_trigger, c_trigger) was determined in step 6c or 6d, draw a 4x4 hollow square in the output grid using the digit '1', with the top-left corner at (r_trigger, c_trigger).
7.  Return the resulting output grid. (Note: Assumes generated patterns are overlaid additively, with non-zero digits taking precedence over zero, but behavior for overlapping non-zero digits is undefined by examples).
