            "text": "Okay, let's analyze this first example.\n\n## Initial Perception\n\nThe input and output are both 20x20 grids containing digits. The transformation involves identifying specific patterns or markers in the input grid and generating corresponding shapes or patterns in the output grid, often with different digits and sometimes at different locations.\n\n1.  **Background:** The background digit is '0' in both input and output.\n2.  **Pattern 1 (Digit 6):** The input contains two distinct 2x2 blocks of '6's. In the output, these blocks appear to have shifted one cell up and one cell left.\n3.  **Pattern 2 (Digit 2 -> 4):** The input contains four instances of the digit '2', forming the corners of a rectangle ((1, 8), (1, 13), (6, 8), (6, 13)). In the output, each of these locations becomes the top-left corner of a 4x4 hollow square drawn with the digit '4'.\n4.  **Pattern 3 (Digit 5 & 3 -> 6):** The input has '5's at (11, 8) and (11, 13), and '3's at (16, 8) and (16, 13). These four points form a rectangle. In the output, these seem to trigger the creation of four 2x2 blocks of '6's. The blocks corresponding to the '5's start at the original '5' location. The blocks corresponding to the '3's start at a location shifted upwards by 3 rows (e.g., input '3' at (16, 8) triggers an output block starting at (13, 8)). An isolated '5' at (5, 5) in the input does not produce any output. This suggests the rectangular formation is necessary.\n5.  **Pattern 4 (Digit 3 -> 1):** The input has '3's at (11, 2) and (16, 2). These are vertically aligned. In the output, a 4x4 hollow square using the digit '1' appears, with its top-left corner at the location of the lower '3' (16, 2). The '3's involved in the rectangle pattern (16, 8 and 16, 13) do not trigger this rule. This suggests only vertically aligned pairs not participating in the 5/3 rectangle trigger this.\n6.  **Overlap:** Based on this example, the generated output patterns do not seem to overlap or overwrite each other.\n\n## Observed Facts (YAML)\n\n"

Identify all input cells (r, c) that are the top-left corner of a 2x2 block filled entirely with '6'. For each such cell, fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at position (r-1, c-1).\n3.  Identify all input cells (r, c) containing the digit '2'. For each such cell, draw a 4x4 hollow square (perimeter filled, interior empty) in the output grid using the digit '4', with the top-left corner at (r, c).\n4.  Identify all pairs of input cells (r1, c) and (r2, c) containing the digit '3' where r1 < r2 (a vertically aligned pair). Ensure these '3's are not part of a detected \"FiveThreeRectangle\" (see step 5). For each such valid pair, draw a 4x4 hollow square in the output grid using the digit '1', with the top-left corner at (r2, c).\n5.  Identify all sets of four input cells P1=(r1, c1), P2=(r1, c2), P3=(r2, c1), P4=(r2, c2) such that r1 < r2, c1 < c2, the digit at P1 and P2 is '5', and the digit at P3 and P4 is '3'. For each such set found:\n    a.  Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at P1=(r1, c1).\n    b.  Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at P2=(r1, c2).\n    c.
