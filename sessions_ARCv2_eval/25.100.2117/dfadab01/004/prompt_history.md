Okay, let's analyze this first example.

## Initial Perception

The input and output are both 20x20 grids containing digits. The transformation involves identifying specific patterns or markers in the input grid and generating corresponding shapes or patterns in the output grid, often with different digits and sometimes at different locations.

1.  **Background:** The background digit is '0' in both input and output.
2.  **Pattern 1 (Digit 6):** The input contains two distinct 2x2 blocks of '6's. In the output, these blocks appear to have shifted one cell up and one cell left.
3.  **Pattern 2 (Digit 2 -> 4):** The input contains four instances of the digit '2', forming the corners of a rectangle ((1, 8), (1, 13), (6, 8), (6, 13)). In the output, each of these locations becomes the top-left corner of a 4x4 hollow square drawn with the digit '4'.
4.  **Pattern 3 (Digit 5 & 3 -> 6):** The input has '5's at (11, 8) and (11, 13), and '3's at (16, 8) and (16, 13). These four points form a rectangle. In the output, these seem to trigger the creation of four 2x2 blocks of '6's. The blocks corresponding to the '5's start at the original '5' location. The blocks corresponding to the '3's start at a location shifted upwards by 3 rows (e.g., input '3' at (16, 8) triggers an output block starting at (13, 8)). An isolated '5' at (5, 5) in the input does not produce any output. This suggests the rectangular formation is necessary.
5.  **Pattern 4 (Digit 3 -> 1):** The input has '3's at (11, 2) and (16, 2). These are vertically aligned. In the output, a 4x4 hollow square using the digit '1' appears, with its top-left corner at the location of the lower '3' (16, 2). The '3's involved in the rectangle pattern (16, 8 and 16, 13) do not trigger this rule. This suggests only vertically aligned pairs not participating in the 5/3 rectangle trigger this.
6.  **Overlap:** Based on this example, the generated output patterns do not seem to overlap or overwrite each other.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize a 20x20 output grid with all zeros.
2.  Identify all input cells (r, c) that are the top-left corner of a 2x2 block filled entirely with '6'. For each such cell, fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at position (r-1, c-1).
3.  Identify all input cells (r, c) containing the digit '2'. For each such cell, draw a 4x4 hollow square (perimeter filled, interior empty) in the output grid using the digit '4', with the top-left corner at (r, c).
4.  Identify all pairs of input cells (r1, c) and (r2, c) containing the digit '3' where r1 < r2 (a vertically aligned pair). Ensure these '3's are not part of a detected "FiveThreeRectangle" (see step 5). For each such valid pair, draw a 4x4 hollow square in the output grid using the digit '1', with the top-left corner at (r2, c).
5.  Identify all sets of four input cells P1=(r1, c1), P2=(r1, c2), P3=(r2, c1), P4=(r2, c2) such that r1 < r2, c1 < c2, the digit at P1 and P2 is '5', and the digit at P3 and P4 is '3'. For each such set found:
    a.  Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at P1=(r1, c1).
    b.  Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at P2=(r1, c2).
    c.  Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at (r2-3, c1).
    d.  Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at (r2-3, c2).
6.  Return the resulting output grid.

## Refined Perception

Based on the two examples provided (`train_1` and `train_2`), the task involves transforming an input grid of digits into an output grid of digits. The grid dimensions can vary (20x20 in `train_1`, 10x10 in `train_2`). The transformation identifies specific digits or patterns of digits in the input and generates corresponding, often larger or shifted, patterns in the output grid using potentially different digits. The background remains '0'.

Key transformations observed across examples:

1.  **Digit '2'**: Consistently maps to a 4x4 hollow square using digit '4' in the output, anchored at the input '2's location. (Seen in `train_1`, `train_2`)
2.  **2x2 Block of '6's**: Maps to a 2x2 block of '6's in the output, shifted one cell up and one cell left relative to the input block's top-left corner. (Seen in `train_1`)
3.  **'5'/'3' Rectangle**: A specific rectangular arrangement of '5's (top row) and '3's (bottom row) generates four distinct 2x2 blocks of '6's in the output, positioned relative to the corners of the input rectangle (top corners match, bottom corners shift up by 3 rows). (Seen in `train_1`)
4.  **Digit '3' (Conditional)**: The behavior associated with '3' appears context-dependent and potentially generates a 4x4 hollow square using digit '1'.
    *   If there exists at least one *vertical pair* of '3's in the input grid that are *not* part of a '5'/'3' rectangle, locate the pair with the lowest bottom-row index. Generate the output square anchored at the position of the *lower* '3' of this specific pair. (Rule derived from `train_1`)
    *   If *no* such vertical pair exists, find the '3' in the input grid with the minimum row index (and minimum column index in case of a tie). If this '3' is *not* part of a '5'/'3' rectangle, generate the output square anchored at this '3's position. (Rule derived from `train_2`)
5.  **Hollow Square of '1's**: A 4x4 hollow square made of '1's in the input maps to an identical 4x4 hollow square of '1's in the output, shifted one column to the right relative to the input square's top-left corner. (Seen in `train_2`)

The generation rules appear independent, and their outputs are overlaid onto the initial zero-filled output grid without overwriting each other in the examples seen.

## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros.
2.  Identify all input cells (r, c) containing the digit '2'. For each such cell, draw a 4x4 hollow square (perimeter filled, interior zero/empty) in the output grid using the digit '4', with the top-left corner at (r, c).
3.  Identify all input cells (r, c) that are the top-left corner of a 2x2 block filled entirely with '6'. For each such cell, fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at position (r-1, c-1).
4.  Identify all input cells (r, c) that are the top-left corner of a 4x4 hollow square filled with '1's. For each such cell, draw a 4x4 hollow square in the output grid using the digit '1', with the top-left corner at (r, c+1).
5.  Identify all sets of four input cells P1=(r1, c1), P2=(r1, c2), P3=(r2, c1), P4=(r2, c2) such that r1 < r2, c1 < c2, the digit at P1 and P2 is '5', and the digit at P3 and P4 is '3' (let these be "FiveThreeRectangles").
    a.  For each such set found:
        i.  Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at P1=(r1, c1).
        ii. Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at P2=(r1, c2).
        iii. Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at (r2-3, c1).
        iv. Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at (r2-3, c2).
    b.  Keep track of the coordinates of all '3's that are part of any identified FiveThreeRectangle.
6.  Process the digit '3' to potentially generate a single '1' square:
    a.  Create a list of all '3' locations in the input grid that were *not* identified as part of a FiveThreeRectangle in step 5b (`EligibleThrees`).
    b.  Search `EligibleThrees` for vertical pairs: locations (r_a, c) and (r_b, c) where r_a < r_b.
    c.  If one or more vertical pairs are found: Identify the pair where the lower '3' (r_b, c) has the minimum row index `r_b` across all found pairs. Let the trigger location be this specific (r_b, c).
    d.  If no vertical pairs are found in `EligibleThrees`: Find the location (r_min, c_min) in `EligibleThrees` that has the minimum row index `r_min`. If there are ties for `r_min`, choose the one with the minimum column index `c_min`. Let the trigger location be this (r_min, c_min).
    e.  If a trigger location (r_trigger, c_trigger) was determined in step 6c or 6d, draw a 4x4 hollow square in the output grid using the digit '1', with the top-left corner at (r_trigger, c_trigger).
7.  Return the resulting output grid. (Note: Assumes generated patterns are overlaid additively, with non-zero digits taking precedence over zero, but behavior for overlapping non-zero digits is undefined by examples).

## Refined Perception

This third example (`train_3`) reinforces some existing hypotheses and refines others.

1.  **Grid Dimensions:** The grid size is 10x10, confirming variability.
2.  **Background:** Remains '0'.
3.  **Rule '2' -> '4' Square:** This rule is strongly confirmed. All four instances of '2' in the input at locations (0, 6), (4, 4), (6, 0), and (6, 6) correctly generate 4x4 hollow squares using the digit '4' in the output, anchored at the corresponding input locations.
4.  **Hollow Squares in Input:** The input contains a 4x4 hollow square made of '4's starting at (0, 0). In the previous example (`train_2`), a 4x4 hollow square of '1's resulted in a shifted '1' square in the output. However, in this example, the input '4' square produces *no* corresponding output pattern. This indicates that the rule observed for the '1' square is specific to the digit '1' and does not generalize to hollow squares made of other digits like '4'. Input '4' squares are ignored by the transformation.
5.  **Other Rules:** This example contains no '1's, '3's, '5's, or '6's, so the rules associated with those digits (ShiftOneSquare, TriggerOneSquareFromThree, GenerateSixBlocksFromFiveThreeRectangle, ShiftSixBlock) are neither confirmed nor contradicted by this specific pair.

The core transformation appears to be a set of independent rules triggered by specific input digits or specific patterns composed of certain digits. The generation of output patterns seems additive onto a zero background.

## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the dimensions (height H, width W) of the input grid.
2.  Initialize an output grid of dimensions HxW, filled with zeros.
3.  Identify all input cells (r, c) containing the digit '2'. For each such cell, draw a 4x4 hollow square (perimeter filled, interior zero/empty) in the output grid using the digit '4', with the top-left corner at (r, c). Ensure drawing stays within grid boundaries.
4.  Identify all input cells (r, c) that are the top-left corner of a 2x2 block filled entirely with '6'. For each such cell, fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at position (r-1, c-1). Ensure drawing stays within grid boundaries.
5.  Identify all input cells (r, c) that are the top-left corner of a 4x4 hollow square filled *specifically* with '1's. For each such cell, draw a 4x4 hollow square in the output grid using the digit '1', with the top-left corner at (r, c+1). Ensure drawing stays within grid boundaries. (Note: Hollow squares made of other digits, like '4', in the input are ignored for this rule).
6.  Identify all sets of four input cells P1=(r1, c1), P2=(r1, c2), P3=(r2, c1), P4=(r2, c2) such that r1 < r2, c1 < c2, the digit at P1 and P2 is '5', and the digit at P3 and P4 is '3' (let these be "FiveThreeRectangles").
    a.  For each such set found:
        i.  Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at P1=(r1, c1).
        ii. Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at P2=(r1, c2).
        iii. Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at (r2-3, c1).
        iv. Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at (r2-3, c2).
        (Ensure drawing stays within grid boundaries for all blocks).
    b.  Keep track of the coordinates of all '3's that are part of any identified FiveThreeRectangle.
7.  Process the digit '3' to potentially generate a single '1' square:
    a.  Create a list of all '3' locations in the input grid that were *not* identified as part of a FiveThreeRectangle in step 6b (`EligibleThrees`).
    b.  Search `EligibleThrees` for vertical pairs: locations (r_a, c) and (r_b, c) where r_a < r_b.
    c.  If one or more vertical pairs are found: Identify the pair where the lower '3' (r_b, c) has the minimum row index `r_b` across all found pairs. Let the trigger location be this specific (r_b, c).
    d.  If no vertical pairs are found in `EligibleThrees`: Find the location (r_min, c_min) in `EligibleThrees` that has the minimum row index `r_min`. If there are ties for `r_min`, choose the one with the minimum column index `c_min`. Let the trigger location be this (r_min, c_min).
    e.  If a trigger location (r_trigger, c_trigger) was determined in step 7c or 7d, draw a 4x4 hollow square in the output grid using the digit '1', with the top-left corner at (r_trigger, c_trigger). Ensure drawing stays within grid boundaries.
8.  Return the resulting output grid. (Note: Assumes generated patterns are overlaid additively, with non-zero digits taking precedence over zero. Behavior for overlapping non-zero digits from *different* rules remains undefined by examples).
```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Tuple, Set

"""
Transforms an input grid based on specific digit patterns and locations:

1.  Finds all occurrences of digit '2' and draws a 4x4 hollow square using '4' at each location in the output.
2.  Finds all top-left corners (r, c) of 2x2 blocks filled with '6' and draws a 2x2 block of '6' at (r-1, c-1) in the output.
3.  Finds all top-left corners (r, c) of 4x4 hollow squares filled with '1' and draws a 4x4 hollow square of '1' at (r, c+1) in the output.
4.  Identifies "FiveThreeRectangles" formed by '5's in the top row and '3's in the bottom row. For each rectangle defined by corners (r1, c1), (r1, c2), (r2, c1), (r2, c2), it draws four 2x2 blocks of '6' in the output at locations (r1, c1), (r1, c2), (r2-3, c1), and (r2-3, c2). It tracks the '3's used in these rectangles.
5.  Processes remaining '3's (not part of FiveThreeRectangles). If vertical pairs exist, it finds the pair with the lowest bottom '3' and draws a 4x4 hollow square of '1' at that bottom '3's location. If no vertical pairs exist, it finds the topmost, then leftmost '3' and draws the '1' square there. Only one '1' square is drawn based on this rule.
6.  Overlapping patterns are overlaid; non-zero digits overwrite zeros.
