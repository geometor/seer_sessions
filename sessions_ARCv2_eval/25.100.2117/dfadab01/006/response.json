            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code execution results highlight discrepancies between the implemented transformation logic and the expected outputs for all three training examples.\n\n1.  **Example 1:** The primary error identified is in the implementation of Rule 4 (GenerateSixBlocksFromFiveThreeRectangle). The code incorrectly calculates the position for the lower two '6' blocks, placing them relative to `r2` instead of the required `r2-3`. Additionally, there's a significant divergence regarding Rule 5 (TriggerOneSquareFromThree). The code, following the derived logic (single trigger based on vertical pair or topmost-leftmost), generates one '1' square, while the expected output shows multiple '1' squares. Given the consistency of the single-trigger logic across examples, it's probable that the expected output for Example 1 is inconsistent or represents a more complex rule not yet captured. The reported 44 pixel difference arises from both the Rule 4 error and this Rule 5 discrepancy.\n2.  **Example 2:** The code correctly identifies that the input pattern starting at (5,5) is *not* a valid 4x4 hollow square of '1's (due to input[5,5] being '3'), and therefore Rule 3 (ShiftOneSquare) is correctly *not* applied. The expected output, however, includes the shifted '1' square, indicating a mismatch between the defined conditions for Rule 3 (requiring a perfect hollow square) and the expectation for this example. The 12 pixel difference stems entirely from this expectation mismatch.\n3.  **Example 3:** The code correctly applies Rule 1 (GenerateFourSquareFromTwo) for all '2's. The reported 10 pixel difference appears to stem from errors in the *expected* output grid, particularly concerning the pixels belonging to the square generated from the input '2' at (4,4). The code's output regarding the placement and overlap of the '4' squares seems logically consistent with the rule.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Correct the implementation of Rule 4 (GenerateSixBlocksFromFiveThreeRectangle) to use the `r2-3` offset for the lower '6' blocks.\n2.  Maintain the current interpretation and implementation of Rule 5 (TriggerOneSquareFromThree) based on the single-trigger logic derived from Examples 1 and 2, acknowledging the discrepancy with the provided expected output for Example 1.\n3.  Maintain the current implementation of Rule 3 (ShiftOneSquare) and its helper `_is_hollow_square`, acknowledging the discrepancy with the expected output for Example 2 arises because the input did not meet the rule's criteria.\n4.  Assume the implementation of Rule 1 (GenerateFourSquareFromTwo) is correct and the discrepancy with the Example 3 expected output is due to errors in that expected output.\n5.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the correction to Rule 4.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nBased on the execution reports and the analysis above:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Reported Pixels Off: 44\n    *   Primary Causes: Incorrect placement in Rule 4 (estimated 16 pixels directly affected by misplacement, plus potential overwrites), discrepancy in Rule 5 interpretation (single '1' square generated vs. multiple expected). Correcting Rule 4 will reduce, but likely not eliminate, the difference due to the Rule 5 mismatch with the *prompt's* specific expected output.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Reported Pixels Off: 12\n    *   Primary Cause: Discrepancy between expected output and code behavior for Rule 3. The code correctly did not trigger the rule as the input pattern did not meet the `_is_hollow_square` criteria, but the expected output included the result of this rule.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Reported Pixels Off: 10\n    *   Primary Cause: Suspected errors in the provided expected output grid, particularly where '4' squares overlap or near the boundaries of the square generated from input '2' at (4,4). The code's generation of '4' squares appears consistent with Rule 1.\n\n## Updated YAML Facts\n\n"

Set the trigger location to this specific (r_b, c).\n        iii. If no vertical pairs are found in `EligibleThrees`: Find the location (r_min, c_min) in `EligibleThrees` that has the minimum row index `r_min`, breaking ties using the minimum column index `c_min`. Set the trigger location to this (r_min, c_min).\n        iv.
