Determine the dimensions (height H, width W) of the input grid.\n2.  Initialize an output grid of dimensions HxW, filled with zeros.\n3.  Create lists of locations for all '3's and '5's in the input grid. Initialize an empty set `used_threes_in_rectangle` to track '3's used in Rule 4.\n4.  Apply Rule 4 (FiveThreeRectangle):\n    a.  Iterate through all pairs of '5' locations to find potential horizontal top edges (r1, c1) and (r1, c2) where c1 < c2.\n    b.  For each potential top edge, iterate through all pairs of '3' locations to find potential corresponding bottom edges (r2, c1) and (r2, c2) where r2 > r1.\n    c.  If a valid rectangle is found (matching coordinates r1, r2, c1, c2):\n        i.  Add the locations (r2, c1) and (r2, c2) to the `used_threes_in_rectangle` set.\n        ii. Draw a 2x2 block of '6's in the output grid starting at (r1, c1).\n        iii. Draw a 2x2 block of '6's in the output grid starting at (r1, c2).\n        iv. Draw a 2x2 block of '6's in the output grid starting at (r2 - 3, c1).\n        v.  Draw a 2x2 block of '6's in the output grid starting at (r2 - 3, c2).\n        (Ensure drawing stays within grid boundaries).\n5.  Apply Rule 1 (TwoMarker):\n    a.  Iterate through every cell (r, c) of the input grid.\n    b.  If the cell contains the digit '2', draw a 4x4 hollow square of '4's in the output grid, with the top-left corner at (r, c). (Ensure boundaries).\n6.  Apply Rule 2 (SixBlock):\n    a.  Iterate through potential top-left corners (r, c) such that r < H-1 and c < W-1.\n    b.  Check if the 2x2 block starting at (r, c) in the input grid consists entirely of '6's.\n    c.  If it does, draw a 2x2 block of '6's in the output grid starting at (r - 1, c - 1). (Ensure boundaries).\n7.  Apply Rule 3 (OneSquare):\n    a.  Iterate through potential top-left corners (r, c) such that r < H-3 and c < W-3.\n    b.  Check if the 4x4 area starting at (r, c) in the input grid forms a hollow square of '1's (using the `is_hollow_square` helper function).\n    c.  If it does, draw a 4x4 hollow square of '1's in the output grid, with the top-left corner at (r, c + 1). (Ensure boundaries).\n8.  Apply Rule 5 (TriggerOneSquareFromThree):\n    a.  Create a list `EligibleThrees` containing locations of all '3's from the initial list (step 3) that are *not* in the `used_threes_in_rectangle` set.\n    b.  If `EligibleThrees` is not empty:\n        i.  Search `EligibleThrees` for vertical pairs: locations (r_a, c) and (r_b, c) where r_a < r_b.\n        ii. If vertical pairs exist: Find the pair where `r_b` is minimized. Set the trigger location to this (r_b, c).\n        iii. If no vertical pairs exist: Sort `EligibleThrees` first by row index, then by column index. Set the trigger location to the first element (r_min, c_min).\n        iv. If a trigger location (r_trigger, c_trigger) was determined, draw a 4x4 hollow square of '1's in the output grid, with the top-left corner at (r_trigger, c_trigger). (Ensure boundaries).\n9.  Return the resulting output grid. (Note: The order of rule application determines final pixel values in case of overlap between non-zero digits from different rules).\n\"\"\"\n\n\n# Helper function to check grid boundaries\ndef _is_valid(r, c, height, width):\n    \"\"\"Checks if coordinates (r, c) are within grid bounds.\"\"\"\n    return 0 <= r < height and 0 <= c < width\n\n# Helper function to draw a filled block\ndef _draw_block(grid: np.ndarray, r: int, c: int, h: int, w: int, value: int):\n    \"\"\"Draws a solid h x w block with top-left at (r, c) using 'value'.\"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    for i in range(r, r + h):\n        for j in range(c, c + w):\n            if _is_valid(i, j, height, width):\n                grid[i, j] = value\n\n# Helper function to draw a hollow square\ndef _draw_hollow_square(grid: np.ndarray, r: int, c: int, size: int, value: int):\n    \"\"\"Draws a hollow square of 'size' x 'size' with top-left at (r, c) using 'value'.\"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    # Draw top and bottom edges\n    for j in range(c, c + size):\n        if _is_valid(r, j, height, width):\n            grid[r, j] = value\n        if _is_valid(r + size -
