## Refined Perception

This third example (`train_3`) reinforces some existing hypotheses and refines others.

1.  **Grid Dimensions:** The grid size is 10x10, confirming variability.
2.  **Background:** Remains '0'.
3.  **Rule '2' -> '4' Square:** This rule is strongly confirmed. All four instances of '2' in the input at locations (0, 6), (4, 4), (6, 0), and (6, 6) correctly generate 4x4 hollow squares using the digit '4' in the output, anchored at the corresponding input locations.
4.  **Hollow Squares in Input:** The input contains a 4x4 hollow square made of '4's starting at (0, 0). In the previous example (`train_2`), a 4x4 hollow square of '1's resulted in a shifted '1' square in the output. However, in this example, the input '4' square produces *no* corresponding output pattern. This indicates that the rule observed for the '1' square is specific to the digit '1' and does not generalize to hollow squares made of other digits like '4'. Input '4' squares are ignored by the transformation.
5.  **Other Rules:** This example contains no '1's, '3's, '5's, or '6's, so the rules associated with those digits (ShiftOneSquare, TriggerOneSquareFromThree, GenerateSixBlocksFromFiveThreeRectangle, ShiftSixBlock) are neither confirmed nor contradicted by this specific pair.

The core transformation appears to be a set of independent rules triggered by specific input digits or specific patterns composed of certain digits. The generation of output patterns seems additive onto a zero background.

## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the dimensions (height H, width W) of the input grid.
2.  Initialize an output grid of dimensions HxW, filled with zeros.
3.  Identify all input cells (r, c) containing the digit '2'. For each such cell, draw a 4x4 hollow square (perimeter filled, interior zero/empty) in the output grid using the digit '4', with the top-left corner at (r, c). Ensure drawing stays within grid boundaries.
4.  Identify all input cells (r, c) that are the top-left corner of a 2x2 block filled entirely with '6'. For each such cell, fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at position (r-1, c-1). Ensure drawing stays within grid boundaries.
5.  Identify all input cells (r, c) that are the top-left corner of a 4x4 hollow square filled *specifically* with '1's. For each such cell, draw a 4x4 hollow square in the output grid using the digit '1', with the top-left corner at (r, c+1). Ensure drawing stays within grid boundaries. (Note: Hollow squares made of other digits, like '4', in the input are ignored for this rule).
6.  Identify all sets of four input cells P1=(r1, c1), P2=(r1, c2), P3=(r2, c1), P4=(r2, c2) such that r1 < r2, c1 < c2, the digit at P1 and P2 is '5', and the digit at P3 and P4 is '3' (let these be "FiveThreeRectangles").
    a.  For each such set found:
        i.  Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at P1=(r1, c1).
        ii. Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at P2=(r1, c2).
        iii. Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at (r2-3, c1).
        iv. Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid with '6' starting at (r2-3, c2).
        (Ensure drawing stays within grid boundaries for all blocks).
    b.  Keep track of the coordinates of all '3's that are part of any identified FiveThreeRectangle.
7.  Process the digit '3' to potentially generate a single '1' square:
    a.  Create a list of all '3' locations in the input grid that were *not* identified as part of a FiveThreeRectangle in step 6b (`EligibleThrees`).
    b.  Search `EligibleThrees` for vertical pairs: locations (r_a, c) and (r_b, c) where r_a < r_b.
    c.  If one or more vertical pairs are found: Identify the pair where the lower '3' (r_b, c) has the minimum row index `r_b` across all found pairs. Let the trigger location be this specific (r_b, c).
    d.  If no vertical pairs are found in `EligibleThrees`: Find the location (r_min, c_min) in `EligibleThrees` that has the minimum row index `r_min`. If there are ties for `r_min`, choose the one with the minimum column index `c_min`. Let the trigger location be this (r_min, c_min).
    e.  If a trigger location (r_trigger, c_trigger) was determined in step 7c or 7d, draw a 4x4 hollow square in the output grid using the digit '1', with the top-left corner at (r_trigger, c_trigger). Ensure drawing stays within grid boundaries.
8.  Return the resulting output grid. (Note: Assumes generated patterns are overlaid additively, with non-zero digits taking precedence over zero. Behavior for overlapping non-zero digits from *different* rules remains undefined by examples).
