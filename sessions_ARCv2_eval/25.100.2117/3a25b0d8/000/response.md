Okay, let's break down this task based on the first example.

**Initial Perception**

The input is a large grid (22x22) composed primarily of the digit '8', which appears to function as a background color. Embedded within this background are several distinct regions or patterns formed by other digits (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9). The digit '1' often appears around or connecting these other patterned regions.

The output is a smaller grid (11x11). It seems to be a composite view derived from a specific subsection of the input grid, focusing on the cluster of patterns involving digits 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9. The transformation doesn't appear to be a simple crop or subsampling. Instead, it looks like specific rows (or modified versions of rows) from a particular vertical slice of the input are selected, potentially duplicated, and assembled to form the output grid. The selection and modification logic seems tied to the presence of characteristic numerical patterns within those input rows.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify a specific vertical slice of the input grid, 11 columns wide (tentatively columns 11 through 21).
2.  Within this slice, identify key rows based on the presence of distinct numerical patterns (e.g., rows containing `4 4 4`, `9 9 9`, `6 6`, `1 1 1 1 1`, `3 ... 3`, etc.). The relevant input rows seem to be 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and possibly others like 9, 10, 17 influencing generated patterns.
3.  Construct an 11x11 output grid by selecting, modifying, duplicating, and arranging rows derived from these key input rows within the identified slice.
4.  Apply the following transformations/selections to generate the output rows:
    *   Copy the slice from input row 12 directly to output row 4.
    *   Copy the slice from input row 15 directly to output row 7.
    *   Copy the slice from input row 16 directly to output rows 8 and 9 (duplication).
    *   Take the slice from input row 14, change the second and tenth elements (indices 1 and 9) from '8' to '1', and place it in output row 6.
    *   Take the slice from input row 11, replace the central sequence `4 1 4 1 1` with `1 1 1 1 1`, and place the result in output rows 3 and 5 (duplication).
    *   Generate specific border/pattern rows (`8 8 8 1 1 1 1 1 8 8 8`) and place them in output rows 0 and 10 (duplication).
    *   Generate specific pattern rows containing `7 7 7` (`8 8 1 1 7 7 7 1 1 8 8` and `8 1 1 1 7 7 7 1 1 1 8`) and place them in output rows 1 and 2 respectively.
5.  Arrange these generated, modified, and copied rows in the specified order to form the final 11x11 output grid.
