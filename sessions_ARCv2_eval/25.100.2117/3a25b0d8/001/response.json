            "text": "**Refined Perception**\n\nThe task involves transforming a larger input grid into a smaller output grid. The transformation focuses on identifying distinct regions of non-background patterns within the input grid. The background color appears to be the most frequent color, often framing the grid.\n\nUnlike the initial hypothesis of a fixed-size slice, the process seems more dynamic:\n1.  It identifies one or more significant contiguous regions containing patterns of non-background digits.\n2.  For each identified region, it extracts relevant row slices, potentially applying transformations. The width of the extracted slices seems to determine the width of the corresponding part of the output grid.\n3.  Transformations include:\n    *   Direct copying of row slices.\n    *   Duplication of certain output rows (often rows derived from simpler input patterns or those adjacent to more complex ones).\n    *   Modification of specific digits within a slice, potentially simplifying a pattern (e.g., `41411` -> `11111` in train_1) or changing border digits (e.g., `8...8` -> `1...1` in train_1, `1...1` -> `2...2` in train_2).\n4.  The transformed slices from the selected region(s) are vertically stacked to form the final output grid. If multiple regions are processed (as in train_2), their outputs are concatenated vertically, maintaining the relative top-to-bottom order of the source regions in the input.\n\nThe selection criteria for regions (if multiple exist) and the specific rules for modification and duplication need further clarification with more examples but seem linked to the patterns within the rows.\n\n**Updated Facts (YAML)**\n\n"

Identify all distinct contiguous rectangular regions formed by non-background digits.\n2.  **Select Regions:** Choose the region(s) to process. (Current hypothesis: process all identified regions sequentially from top to bottom based on their starting row in the input).\n3.  **Initialize Output Row List:** Create an empty list to store the final output rows.\n4.  **Process Each Selected Region:** For each region selected in step 2:\n    a.  **Define Slice Parameters:** Determine the bounding rows of the region and the column slice (start column, end column, width) to be extracted. The width of this slice corresponds to the width of this section of the output grid.\n    b.  **Generate Region Output Rows:** Create an empty list for this region's output rows. Iterate through the input rows within the region's row bounds. For each input row:\n        i.  Extract the column slice defined in step 4a.\n        ii. **Apply Pattern-Based Rules:** Based on the pattern within the extracted slice, decide the transformation:\n            *   **Skip:** If the row/pattern is deemed irrelevant (e.g., `111...111` in train_1 row 13), do nothing.\n            *   **Copy:** If the pattern requires no change, add the slice directly to the region's output row list. Check for duplication rules.\n            *   **Modify:** If the pattern requires modification (e.g., simplifying `41411` to `11111`, changing `8` to `2`, altering border `1`s to `2`s or `8`s to `1`s), apply the change to create a modified row. Add the modified row to the region's output row list. Check for duplication rules.\n            *   **Duplication Check:** If the rule associated with the copied/modified row indicates duplication, add the *same* row again immediately to the region's output row list. (Duplication seems common for rows derived from simpler input patterns or specific key rows).\n    c.  **Append to Final Output:** Add all generated rows for the current region to the main output row list created in step 3.\n5.  **Construct Output Grid:** Assemble the final output grid from the complete list of output rows."
