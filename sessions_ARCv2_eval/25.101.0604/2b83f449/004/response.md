## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code attempts failed to accurately replicate the transformation. The core logic (`777` -> `868`) and the vertical neighbor rule (`8` next to center `7` -> `6`) appear relatively stable. However, the rule governing the appearance of the number `3` and the preservation of original numbers (especially `8`, `3`, and `0`) adjacent to the `777` patterns is complex and was incorrectly modeled.

The key challenges identified:
1.  **Adjacent '3' Rule:** The conditions under which a cell adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to an *outer* `7` becomes `3` are unclear. Simple adjacency leads to too many changes, while constraints based on the input value (e.g., "not 0", "not 8") fail to match the expected output consistently across examples.
2.  **Precedence:** While a priority order (Core > Vertical 6 > Adjacent 3) seems logical for cells affected by multiple potential rules, the exact definition of the lower-priority "Adjacent 3" rule remains the main issue. The complex precedence logic from the first attempt also failed.
3.  **Unexplained Changes/Preservations:** Several cells in the expected output, particularly `8`s that remain `8` despite being adjacent to outer `7`s, and the `(0,0)` change from `3` to `8` in both examples, cannot be explained by the currently hypothesized rules. These might indicate missing rules or potential inconsistencies/noise in the training data.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Solidify Core Rules:** Maintain the highest priority for the Core (`777` -> `868`) and Vertical Neighbor (`8` -> `6`) rules.
2.  **Simplify Adjacent Rule:** Implement the simplest version of the Adjacent Neighbor rule: Any cell adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to an outer `7`, if not modified by a higher priority rule, becomes `3`. This is based on the observation that many cells *do* follow this pattern, even though it creates known conflicts with the expected output for other cells.
3.  **Strict Priority:** Enforce the priority strictly: Core -> Vertical -> Adjacent.
4.  **Analyze Discrepancies:** Use the output generated by this simplified model to precisely pinpoint the remaining discrepancies against the expected output. This analysis will be crucial for the *next* iteration to potentially identify the more subtle constraints or additional rules governing the transformation. For this iteration, we acknowledge the model is likely incomplete.

## Metrics

Metrics based on the *logic* of the **second code attempt** (code_01.py logic with strict R1>R2>R3 priority and simple R3: adj->3):

*(Simulation of this logic suggests it produces results similar to the first failed trace, with many incorrect '3's. The exact pixel counts below are based on that simulated outcome, assuming the previous trace was representative of this logic)*

**Example 1:**
*   Input Size: 13x19
*   Output Size: 13x19
*   Simulated Code Output Match: False
*   Estimated Pixels Off: ~76 (Similar to first trace discrepancy after correcting its own internal inconsistencies)
*   Key Discrepancies (Simulated Logic vs Expected):
    *   Cells like `(0,1)` (In 8), `(0,3)` (In 8) become `3` in simulation but should be `8`.
    *   Cell `(0,0)` (In 3) becomes `3` in simulation but should be `8`.
    *   Rule 2 (Vertical 6) correctly changes cells like `(0,4)`, `(2,4)` to `6`.
    *   Rule 3 correctly changes cells like `(2,0)`, `(6,1)`, `(12,9)` to `3`.

**Example 2:**
*   Input Size: 11x16
*   Output Size: 11x16
*   Simulated Code Output Match: False
*   Estimated Pixels Off: ~52 (Similar to first trace discrepancy after corrections)
*   Key Discrepancies (Simulated Logic vs Expected):
    *   Cells like `(0,1)` (In 8), `(0,3)` (In 8) become `3` but should be `8`.
    *   Cells like `(4,15)` (In 3) become `3` (correct), `(4,14)` (In 8) become `3` (correct).
    *   Cell `(0,0)` (In 3) becomes `3` but should be `8`.

## YAML Facts

```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions (height, width)
    - cells containing single digits (0-8)
Objects:
  - Pattern:
      Type: Horizontal sequence
      Value: [7, 7, 7]
      Properties:
        - center_cell_location: (r, c) based on input grid
        - outer_cell_locations: [(r, c-1), (r, c+1)] based on input grid
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all instances of the [7, 7, 7] Pattern in the input grid.
  - Transform: Modify cell values in an output grid based on rules and precedence, using input grid values and pattern locations.
  - Rules (applied in order of priority):
      - Rule_Core (Priority 1):
          Input: Cell is an outer_cell_location or center_cell_location.
          Output: Change outer cells to 8, center cell to 6.
      - Rule_Vertical_Neighbor (Priority 2):
          Input: Input cell value is 8 AND cell is vertically adjacent to a center_cell_location.
          Output: Change cell to 6.
      - Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor (Priority 3):
          Input: Cell is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any outer_cell_location.
          Output: Change cell to 3.
      - Rule_Copy (Priority 4):
          Input: Cell not modified by any higher priority rule.
          Output: Keep the original input value.
Relationships:
  - Adjacency:
      Type: Orthogonal (Up, Down)
      Used_by: Rule_Vertical_Neighbor (specifically vertical adjacency to center_cell_location)
  - Adjacency:
      Type: Orthogonal and Diagonal (8 neighbors)
      Used_by: Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor (adjacency to outer_cell_location)
  - Precedence: Rules are evaluated and applied strictly in the order: Core -> Vertical_Neighbor -> Adjacent_Neighbor -> Copy. Once a rule modifies a cell, subsequent lower-priority rules do not affect it for that cell.
Notes:
  - The definition of Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor is simplified and known to produce discrepancies compared to the expected output, particularly regarding input cells with value 8 or 3 that remain unchanged in the expected output despite adjacency.
  - Unexplained behavior (e.g., input (0,0)=3 becoming output 8) exists in the examples and is not captured by these rules.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a deep copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Identify all locations `(r, c)` which are the center of a horizontal `7 7 7` pattern in the `input_grid`. Store these as `center_7_locations`.
3.  Identify all corresponding left `(r, c-1)` and right `(r, c+1)` locations for each center found in the `input_grid`. Store these as `outer_7_locations`.
4.  Create a set `modified_cells` to keep track of cells that have already been changed by a higher-priority rule.
5.  **Apply Core Rule (Priority 1):**
    *   Iterate through each location `(r, c)` in `center_7_locations`. Set `output_grid[r][c] = 6` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.
    *   Iterate through each location `(r, c)` in `outer_7_locations`. Set `output_grid[r][c] = 8` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.
6.  **Apply Vertical Neighbor Rule (Priority 2):**
    *   Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` in the grid.
    *   If `(r, c)` is *not* in `modified_cells` AND the `input_grid[r][c]` value is `8`:
        *   Check if the cell directly above `(r-1, c)` or directly below `(r+1, c)` exists within the grid boundaries and is in `center_7_locations`.
        *   If yes, set `output_grid[r][c] = 6` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.
7.  **Apply Adjacent Neighbor Rule (Priority 3):**
    *   Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` in the grid.
    *   If `(r, c)` is *not* in `modified_cells`:
        *   Check if `(r, c)` is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to *any* location present in the `outer_7_locations` set.
        *   If yes, set `output_grid[r][c] = 3` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.
8.  **Apply Copy Rule (Priority 4):** All cells not added to `modified_cells` retain their original value (which they already have from the initial copy).
9.  Return the final `output_grid`.
