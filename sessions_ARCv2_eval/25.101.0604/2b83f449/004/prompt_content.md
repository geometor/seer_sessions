"""
Transforms a grid based on the location of horizontal '7 7 7' patterns, applying rules in a specific order of precedence.

1.  Identifies all horizontal sequences of '7 7 7' in the input grid.
2.  Applies transformation rules in the following priority order:
    a.  Core Rule: The outer '7's of the pattern are changed to '8', and the center '7' is changed to '6'. Cells modified by this rule are finalized.
    b.  Vertical Neighbor Rule: If an *input* cell value is '8' AND it is vertically adjacent to the *center* '7' of a pattern (identified in step 1) AND the cell was not modified by the Core Rule, it is changed to '6'. Cells modified by this rule are finalized.
    c.  Adjacent Neighbor Rule: If an *input* cell value is *not* '0' AND it is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any *outer* '7' of a pattern (identified in step 1) AND the cell was not modified by previous rules, it is changed to '3'. Cells modified by this rule are finalized.
    d.  Copy Rule: Any cell not modified by the above rules retains its original input value.
