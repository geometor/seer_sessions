## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided execution results for the latest code (`code_02.py` logic) confirm that the core transformation (`777` -> `868`) and the vertical neighbor rule (`8` next to center `7` -> `6`) are likely implemented correctly. However, the code significantly overproduces the number `3`, indicating the "Adjacent Neighbor Rule" (Priority 3) is flawed.

The current rule changes *any* cell adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to an original outer `7` location to `3`, provided it wasn't already changed by a higher priority rule. The expected outputs show this is incorrect; many adjacent cells, particularly those with input values `8` or `3`, should retain their original value. Some other adjacent input `8`s and `3`s *do* correctly change to `3`. The exact condition distinguishing these cases remains unclear. Furthermore, there are unexplained changes in the expected output, such as input `3` at `(0,0)` becoming `8` in both examples, which is not captured by any current rule.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Acknowledge Flaws:** Explicitly document the failure of the current "Adjacent Neighbor Rule" (Rule 3) â€“ it changes too many cells to `3`. Also, note the unexplained `3`->`8` change at `(0,0)`.
2.  **Refine Rule 3:** Modify the rule to be more conservative. Since the rule incorrectly changes `8`s and `3`s that should be preserved, and correctly preserves `0`s, a step towards correction is to prevent it from applying to input `8`s and `3`s. The refined Rule 3 will be: Change to `3` only if the input value is NOT `0`, `3`, `7` (handled by core), or `8`, AND the cell is adjacent to an outer `7`.
3.  **Incremental Improvement:** This refined Rule 3 will prevent many *incorrect* changes seen in the current output. However, it will now also *fail* to produce the `3`s that *are* present in the expected output (which originated from input `8` or `3`). This is accepted as an intermediate step. The priority remains Core -> Vertical -> Adjacent -> Copy.
4.  **Future Work:** The next iteration will need to focus specifically on identifying the precise conditions under which an adjacent input `8` or `3` *should* become `3`, and address the unexplained `(0,0)` change.

## YAML Facts

```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions (height, width)
    - cells containing single digits (0-8)
Objects:
  - Pattern:
      Type: Horizontal sequence
      Value: [7, 7, 7]
      Properties:
        - center_cell_location: (r, c) based on input grid
        - outer_cell_locations: [(r, c-1), (r, c+1)] based on input grid
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all instances of the [7, 7, 7] Pattern in the input grid.
  - Transform: Modify cell values in an output grid based on rules and precedence, using input grid values and pattern locations.
  - Rules (applied in order of priority):
      - Rule_Core (Priority 1):
          Input: Cell is an outer_cell_location or center_cell_location.
          Output: Change outer cells to 8, center cell to 6.
      - Rule_Vertical_Neighbor (Priority 2):
          Input: Input cell value is 8 AND cell is vertically adjacent to a center_cell_location.
          Output: Change cell to 6.
      - Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor (Priority 3):
          Input: Input cell value is NOT 0, NOT 3, NOT 7, NOT 8 AND cell is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any outer_cell_location.
          Output: Change cell to 3.
          Note: This rule is refined to prevent incorrect changes observed previously, but now fails to produce correct '3' outputs derived from input 3 or 8. The precise condition for this transformation is still undetermined.
      - Rule_Copy (Priority 4):
          Input: Cell not modified by any higher priority rule.
          Output: Keep the original input value.
Relationships:
  - Adjacency:
      Type: Orthogonal (Up, Down)
      Used_by: Rule_Vertical_Neighbor (specifically vertical adjacency to center_cell_location)
  - Adjacency:
      Type: Orthogonal and Diagonal (8 neighbors)
      Used_by: Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor (adjacency to outer_cell_location)
  - Precedence: Rules are evaluated and applied strictly in the order: Core -> Vertical_Neighbor -> Adjacent_Neighbor -> Copy. Once a rule modifies a cell, subsequent lower-priority rules do not affect it for that cell.
Notes:
  - The condition for Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor remains uncertain.
  - An unexplained transformation exists where Input `3` at `(0,0)` becomes `8` in the expected output when adjacent to an outer_7_location. This is not currently captured.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a deep copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Identify all locations `(r, c)` which are the center of a horizontal `7 7 7` pattern in the `input_grid`. Store these as `center_7_locations`.
3.  Identify all corresponding left `(r, c-1)` and right `(r, c+1)` locations for each center found in the `input_grid`. Store these as `outer_7_locations`.
4.  Create a set `modified_cells` to keep track of cells that have already been changed by a higher-priority rule.
5.  **Apply Core Rule (Priority 1):**
    *   Iterate through each location `(r, c)` in `center_7_locations`. Set `output_grid[r][c] = 6` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.
    *   Iterate through each location `(r, c)` in `outer_7_locations`. Set `output_grid[r][c] = 8` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.
6.  **Apply Vertical Neighbor Rule (Priority 2):**
    *   Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` in the grid.
    *   If `(r, c)` is *not* in `modified_cells` AND the `input_grid[r][c]` value is `8`:
        *   Check if the cell directly above `(r-1, c)` or directly below `(r+1, c)` exists within the grid boundaries and is in `center_7_locations`.
        *   If yes, set `output_grid[r][c] = 6` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.
7.  **Apply Adjacent Neighbor Rule (Priority 3):**
    *   Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` in the grid.
    *   If `(r, c)` is *not* in `modified_cells`:
        *   Check if the `input_grid[r][c]` value is *not* `0`, *not* `3`, *not* `7`, and *not* `8`.
        *   If this condition is true, check if `(r, c)` is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to *any* location present in the `outer_7_locations` set.
        *   If both conditions are true, set `output_grid[r][c] = 3` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.
        *   *(Note: This rule currently prevents many incorrect changes seen previously but also prevents the correct generation of '3' from input '3' or '8'. The exact condition needs further refinement.)*
8.  **Apply Copy Rule (Priority 4):** All cells not added to `modified_cells` retain their original value (which they already have from the initial copy).
9.  Return the final `output_grid`.
