However, the code significantly overproduces the number `3`, indicating the \"Adjacent Neighbor Rule\" (Priority 3) is flawed.\n\nThe current rule changes *any* cell adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to an original outer `7` location to `3`, provided it wasn't already changed by a higher priority rule. The expected outputs show this is incorrect; many adjacent cells, particularly those with input values `8` or `3`, should retain their original value. Some other adjacent input `8`s and `3`s *do* correctly change to `3`. The exact condition distinguishing these cases remains unclear. Furthermore, there are unexplained changes in the expected output, such as input `3` at `(0,0)` becoming `8` in both examples, which is not captured by any current rule.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Acknowledge Flaws:** Explicitly document the failure of the current \"Adjacent Neighbor Rule\" (Rule 3) \u2013 it changes too many cells to `3`. Also, note the unexplained `3`->`8` change at `(0,0)`.\n2.  **Refine Rule 3:** Modify the rule to be more conservative. Since the rule incorrectly changes `8`s and `3`s that should be preserved, and correctly preserves `0`s, a step towards correction is to prevent it from applying to input `8`s and `3`s. The refined Rule 3 will be: Change to `3` only if the input value is NOT `0`, `3`, `7` (handled by core), or `8`, AND the cell is adjacent to an outer `7`.\n3.  **Incremental Improvement:** This refined Rule 3 will prevent many *incorrect* changes seen in the current output. However, it will now also *fail* to produce the `3`s that *are* present in the expected output (which originated from input `8` or `3`). This is accepted as an intermediate step. The priority remains Core -> Vertical -> Adjacent -> Copy.\n4.  **Future Work:** The next iteration will need to focus specifically on identifying the precise conditions under which an adjacent input `8` or `3` *should* become `3`, and address the unexplained `(0,0)` change.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the execution trace provided for `code_02.py` logic:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Size: 13x19\n*   Output Size: 13x19\n*   Code Output Match: False\n*   Pixels Off: 100 / 247\n*   Key Discrepancies:\n    *   Adjacent Rule (Code P3) changes Input `3` to `3` (e.g., `(0,0)`), but Expected is `8`.\n    *   Adjacent Rule (Code P3) changes Input `8` to `3` (e.g., `(0,1)`, `(0,2)`, `(0,3)`, `(0,5)`, `(0,6)`, `(2,2)`, `(2,3)`, etc.), but Expected is `8`.\n    *   Adjacent Rule (Code P3) changes Input `3` to `3` (e.g., `(2,0)`), matching Expected `3`.\n    *   Adjacent Rule (Code P3) changes Input `8` to `3` (e.g., `(2,1)`, `(4,15)`, `(6,1)`, etc.), matching Expected `3`.\n    *   Core Rule (Code P1) and Vertical Rule (Code P2) appear correct (e.g., `(1,4)=6`, `(0,4)=6`).\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Size: 11x16\n*   Output Size: 11x16\n*   Code Output Match: False\n*   Pixels Off: 64 / 176\n*   Key Discrepancies: Similar pattern to Example 1.\n    *   Adjacent Rule (Code P3) changes Input `3` to `3` (e.g., `(0,0)`), but Expected is `8`.\n    *   Adjacent Rule (Code P3) changes Input `8` to `3` (e.g., `(0,1)`, `(0,3)`, `(2,2)`, etc.), but Expected is `8`.\n    *   Adjacent Rule (Code P3) changes Input `3` to `3` (e.g., `(2,0)`, `(4,14)`), matching Expected `3`.\n    *   Adjacent Rule (Code P3) changes Input `8` to `3` (e.g., `(4,15)`, `(8,1)`), matching Expected `3`.\n    *   Core Rule (Code P1) and Vertical Rule (Code P2) appear correct.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n```yaml\nGrid:\n  Properties:\n    - dimensions (height, width)\n    - cells containing single digits (0-8)\nObjects:\n  - Pattern:\n      Type: Horizontal sequence\n      Value: [7, 7, 7]\n      Properties:\n        - center_cell_location: (r, c) based on input grid\n        - outer_cell_locations: [(r, c-1), (r, c+1)] based on input grid\nActions:\n  - Identify: Locate all instances of the [7, 7, 7] Pattern in the input grid.\n  - Transform: Modify cell values in an output grid based on rules and precedence, using input grid values and pattern locations.\n  - Rules (applied in order of priority):\n      - Rule_Core (Priority 1):\n          Input: Cell is an outer_cell_location or center_cell_location.\n          Output: Change outer cells to 8, center cell to 6.\n      - Rule_Vertical_Neighbor (Priority 2):\n          Input: Input cell value is 8 AND cell is vertically adjacent to a center_cell_location.\n          Output: Change cell to 6.\n      - Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor (Priority 3):\n          Input: Input cell value is NOT 0, NOT 3, NOT 7, NOT 8 AND cell is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any outer_cell_location.\n          Output: Change cell to 3.\n          Note: This rule is refined to prevent incorrect changes observed previously, but now fails to produce correct '3' outputs derived from input 3 or 8.

This is not currently captured.\n```\n\n## Natural Language Program\n\n1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a deep copy of the `input_grid`.\n2.  Identify all locations `(r, c)` which are the center of a horizontal `7 7 7` pattern in the `input_grid`. Store these as `center_7_locations`.\n3.  Identify all corresponding left `(r, c-1)` and right `(r, c+1)` locations for each center found in the `input_grid`. Store these as `outer_7_locations`.\n4.  Create a set `modified_cells` to keep track of cells that have already been changed by a higher-priority rule.\n5.  **Apply Core Rule (Priority 1):**\n    *   Iterate through each location `(r, c)` in `center_7_locations`. Set `output_grid[r][c] = 6` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.\n    *   Iterate through each location `(r, c)` in `outer_7_locations`. Set `output_grid[r][c] = 8` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.\n6.  **Apply Vertical Neighbor Rule (Priority 2):**\n    *   Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` in the grid.\n    *   If `(r, c)` is *not* in `modified_cells` AND the `input_grid[r][c]` value is `8`:\n        *   Check if the cell directly above `(r-1, c)` or directly below `(r+1, c)` exists within the grid boundaries and is in `center_7_locations`.\n        *   If yes, set `output_grid[r][c] = 6` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.\n7.  **Apply Adjacent Neighbor Rule (Priority 3):**\n    *   Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` in the grid.\n    *   If `(r, c)` is *not* in `modified_cells`:\n        *   Check if the `input_grid[r][c]` value is *not* `0`, *not* `3`, *not* `7`, and *not* `8`.\n        *   If this condition is true, check if `(r, c)` is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to *any* location present in the `outer_7_locations` set.\n        *   If both conditions are true, set `output_grid[r][c] = 3` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.\n        *   *(Note: This rule currently prevents many incorrect changes seen previously but also prevents the correct generation of '3' from input '3' or '8'. The exact condition needs further refinement.)*\n8.  **Apply Copy Rule (Priority 4):** All cells not added to `modified_cells` retain their original value (which they already have from the initial copy).\n9.  Return the final `output_grid`."
