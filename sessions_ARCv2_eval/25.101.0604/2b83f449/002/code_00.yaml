Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions (height, width)
    - cells containing single digits (0-8)
Objects:
  - Pattern:
      Type: Horizontal sequence
      Value: [7, 7, 7]
      Properties:
        - center_cell_location: (r, c) based on input grid
        - outer_cell_locations: [(r, c-1), (r, c+1)] based on input grid
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all instances of the [7, 7, 7] Pattern in the input grid.
  - Transform: Modify cell values in an output grid based on rules and precedence, using input grid values and pattern locations.
  - Rules (applied in order of priority):
      - Rule_Core:
          Input: Cell is an outer_cell_location or center_cell_location.
          Output: Change outer cells to 8, center cell to 6.
          Priority: 1 (Highest)
      - Rule_Vertical_Neighbor:
          Input: Input cell value is 8 AND cell is vertically adjacent to a center_cell_location.
          Output: Change cell to 6.
          Priority: 2
      - Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor:
          Input: Input cell value is NOT 0 AND cell is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any outer_cell_location.
          Output: Change cell to 3.
          Priority: 3
      - Rule_Copy:
          Input: Cell not modified by any higher priority rule.
          Output: Keep the original input value.
          Priority: 4 (Lowest)
Relationships:
  - Adjacency:
      Type: Orthogonal (Up, Down, Left, Right)
      Used_by: Rule_Vertical_Neighbor (specifically vertical adjacency to center_cell_location)
  - Adjacency:
      Type: Orthogonal and Diagonal (8 neighbors)
      Used_by: Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor (adjacency to outer_cell_location)
  - Precedence: Rules are evaluated and applied strictly in the order: Core -> Vertical_Neighbor -> Adjacent_Neighbor -> Copy. Once a rule modifies a cell, subsequent lower-priority rules do not affect it.
