            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code failed significantly, indicating a misunderstanding of the transformation rules, particularly regarding the generation of the number `3` and the precedence between different rules. The generated output contained far too many `3`s, overwriting correct values generated by other rules (like the vertical `6` rule) and applying the rule to cells where it shouldn't have (like input `0`s in some cases).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Rule Definitions:** Re-analyze the input/output pairs focusing on the conditions under which each output number (especially `3` and `6`) appears relative to the input `7 7 7` patterns.\n2.  **Clarify Precedence:** Establish a strict order of operations for applying the rules. The core `7 7 7 -> 8 6 8` change likely has the highest priority, followed by the vertical `6` change, and then the adjacent `3` change. Unaffected cells retain their original value.\n3.  **Constrain Adjacent '3' Rule:** The rule causing cells adjacent to outer `7`s to become `3` needs constraints. Based on the analysis, it seems this rule should *not* apply if the original cell value is `0`. It also seems to have lower precedence than the vertical `6` rule.\n4.  **Verify Edge Cases:** Pay close attention to cells at the grid boundaries and cells affected by multiple `7 7 7` patterns to ensure the rules and precedence handle them correctly. Address the unexplained `8`s appearing in corners of the expected output, possibly by treating them as data errors if they cannot be explained by a consistent rule.\n5.  **Implement with Priority:** Use a method (like applying rules in strict order or calculating all potential changes and applying the highest priority one) to ensure correct precedence.\n\n## Metrics\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Size: 13x19\n*   Output Size: 13x19\n*   Code Output Match: False\n*   Pixels Off: 124 / 247\n*   Key Discrepancies:\n    *   Code produced `3` where `8` (corners/edges), `6` (vertical adjacency), or `0` (original background) were expected.\n    *   Code failed to produce `6` where expected due to vertical adjacency (e.g., (0,4), (2,4), (2,6)).\n    *   Code incorrectly changed some `0`s to `3` (e.g., (12,3)).\n    *   Unexplained `8`s in expected output corners (e.g., (0,0)).\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Size: 11x16\n*   Output Size: 11x16\n*   Code Output Match: False\n*   Pixels Off: 76 / 176\n*   Key Discrepancies: Similar pattern to Example 1.\n    *   Excessive `3`s generated by the code.\n    *   Missing `6`s where vertical adjacency rule should apply (e.g., (0,4), (2,4), (2,12)).\n    *   Incorrect change of `0` to `3` (e.g., (4,11)).\n    *   Unexplained `8`s in expected output corners (e.g., (0,0)).\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n```yaml\nGrid:\n  Properties:\n    - dimensions (height, width)\n    - cells containing single digits (0-8)\nObjects:\n  - Pattern:\n      Type: Horizontal sequence\n      Value: [7, 7, 7]\n      Properties:\n        - center_cell_location: (r, c) based on input grid\n        - outer_cell_locations: [(r, c-1), (r, c+1)] based on input grid\nActions:\n  - Identify: Locate all instances of the [7, 7, 7] Pattern in the input grid.\n  - Transform: Modify cell values in an output grid based on rules and precedence, using input grid values and pattern locations.\n  - Rules (applied in order of priority):\n      - Rule_Core:\n          Input: Cell is an outer_cell_location or center_cell_location.\n          Output: Change outer cells to 8, center cell to 6.\n          Priority: 1 (Highest)\n      - Rule_Vertical_Neighbor:\n          Input: Input cell value is 8 AND cell is vertically adjacent to a center_cell_location.\n          Output: Change cell to 6.\n          Priority: 2\n      - Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor:\n          Input: Input cell value is NOT 0 AND cell is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any outer_cell_location.\n          Output: Change cell to 3.\n          Priority: 3\n      - Rule_Copy:\n          Input: Cell not modified by any higher priority rule.\n          Output: Keep the original input value.\n          Priority: 4 (Lowest)\nRelationships:\n  - Adjacency:\n      Type: Orthogonal (Up, Down, Left, Right)\n      Used_by: Rule_Vertical_Neighbor (specifically vertical adjacency to center_cell_location)\n  - Adjacency:\n      Type: Orthogonal and Diagonal (8 neighbors)\n      Used_by: Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor (adjacency to outer_cell_location)\n  - Precedence: Rules are evaluated and applied strictly in the order: Core -> Vertical_Neighbor -> Adjacent_Neighbor -> Copy.

Identify all locations `(r, c)` which are the center of a horizontal `7 7 7` pattern in the `input_grid`. Store these as `center_7_locations`.\n3.  Identify all corresponding left `(r, c-1)` and right `(r, c+1)` locations for each center found in the `input_grid`. Store these as `outer_7_locations`.\n4.  Create a set `modified_cells` to keep track of cells that have already been changed.\n5.  **Apply Core Rule (Priority 1):**\n    *   Iterate through each location `(r, c)` in `center_7_locations`. Set `output_grid[r][c] = 6` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.\n    *   Iterate through each location `(r, c)` in `outer_7_locations`. Set `output_grid[r][c] = 8` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.\n6.  **Apply Vertical Neighbor Rule (Priority 2):**\n    *   Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` in the grid.\n    *   If `(r, c)` is *not* in `modified_cells` AND the `input_grid[r][c]` value is `8`:\n        *   Check if the cell directly above `(r-1, c)` or directly below `(r+1, c)` exists and is in `center_7_locations`.\n        *   If yes, set `output_grid[r][c] = 6` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.\n7.  **Apply Adjacent Neighbor Rule (Priority 3):**\n    *   Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` in the grid.\n    *   If `(r, c)` is *not* in `modified_cells` AND the `input_grid[r][c]` value is *not* `0`:\n        *   Check if `(r, c)` is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to *any* location present in the `outer_7_locations` set.\n        *   If yes, set `output_grid[r][c] = 3` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.\n8.  **Apply Copy Rule (Priority 4):** All cells not added to `modified_cells` retain their original value (which they already have from the initial copy).\n9.  Return the final `output_grid`."
