## Assessment and Strategy

The previous code failed significantly, indicating a misunderstanding of the transformation rules, particularly regarding the generation of the number `3` and the precedence between different rules. The generated output contained far too many `3`s, overwriting correct values generated by other rules (like the vertical `6` rule) and applying the rule to cells where it shouldn't have (like input `0`s in some cases).

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Rule Definitions:** Re-analyze the input/output pairs focusing on the conditions under which each output number (especially `3` and `6`) appears relative to the input `7 7 7` patterns.
2.  **Clarify Precedence:** Establish a strict order of operations for applying the rules. The core `7 7 7 -> 8 6 8` change likely has the highest priority, followed by the vertical `6` change, and then the adjacent `3` change. Unaffected cells retain their original value.
3.  **Constrain Adjacent '3' Rule:** The rule causing cells adjacent to outer `7`s to become `3` needs constraints. Based on the analysis, it seems this rule should *not* apply if the original cell value is `0`. It also seems to have lower precedence than the vertical `6` rule.
4.  **Verify Edge Cases:** Pay close attention to cells at the grid boundaries and cells affected by multiple `7 7 7` patterns to ensure the rules and precedence handle them correctly. Address the unexplained `8`s appearing in corners of the expected output, possibly by treating them as data errors if they cannot be explained by a consistent rule.
5.  **Implement with Priority:** Use a method (like applying rules in strict order or calculating all potential changes and applying the highest priority one) to ensure correct precedence.

## Metrics

**Example 1:**
*   Input Size: 13x19
*   Output Size: 13x19
*   Code Output Match: False
*   Pixels Off: 124 / 247
*   Key Discrepancies:
    *   Code produced `3` where `8` (corners/edges), `6` (vertical adjacency), or `0` (original background) were expected.
    *   Code failed to produce `6` where expected due to vertical adjacency (e.g., (0,4), (2,4), (2,6)).
    *   Code incorrectly changed some `0`s to `3` (e.g., (12,3)).
    *   Unexplained `8`s in expected output corners (e.g., (0,0)).

**Example 2:**
*   Input Size: 11x16
*   Output Size: 11x16
*   Code Output Match: False
*   Pixels Off: 76 / 176
*   Key Discrepancies: Similar pattern to Example 1.
    *   Excessive `3`s generated by the code.
    *   Missing `6`s where vertical adjacency rule should apply (e.g., (0,4), (2,4), (2,12)).
    *   Incorrect change of `0` to `3` (e.g., (4,11)).
    *   Unexplained `8`s in expected output corners (e.g., (0,0)).

## YAML Facts

```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions (height, width)
    - cells containing single digits (0-8)
Objects:
  - Pattern:
      Type: Horizontal sequence
      Value: [7, 7, 7]
      Properties:
        - center_cell_location: (r, c) based on input grid
        - outer_cell_locations: [(r, c-1), (r, c+1)] based on input grid
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all instances of the [7, 7, 7] Pattern in the input grid.
  - Transform: Modify cell values in an output grid based on rules and precedence, using input grid values and pattern locations.
  - Rules (applied in order of priority):
      - Rule_Core:
          Input: Cell is an outer_cell_location or center_cell_location.
          Output: Change outer cells to 8, center cell to 6.
          Priority: 1 (Highest)
      - Rule_Vertical_Neighbor:
          Input: Input cell value is 8 AND cell is vertically adjacent to a center_cell_location.
          Output: Change cell to 6.
          Priority: 2
      - Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor:
          Input: Input cell value is NOT 0 AND cell is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any outer_cell_location.
          Output: Change cell to 3.
          Priority: 3
      - Rule_Copy:
          Input: Cell not modified by any higher priority rule.
          Output: Keep the original input value.
          Priority: 4 (Lowest)
Relationships:
  - Adjacency:
      Type: Orthogonal (Up, Down, Left, Right)
      Used_by: Rule_Vertical_Neighbor (specifically vertical adjacency to center_cell_location)
  - Adjacency:
      Type: Orthogonal and Diagonal (8 neighbors)
      Used_by: Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor (adjacency to outer_cell_location)
  - Precedence: Rules are evaluated and applied strictly in the order: Core -> Vertical_Neighbor -> Adjacent_Neighbor -> Copy. Once a rule modifies a cell, subsequent lower-priority rules do not affect it.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a deep copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Identify all locations `(r, c)` which are the center of a horizontal `7 7 7` pattern in the `input_grid`. Store these as `center_7_locations`.
3.  Identify all corresponding left `(r, c-1)` and right `(r, c+1)` locations for each center found in the `input_grid`. Store these as `outer_7_locations`.
4.  Create a set `modified_cells` to keep track of cells that have already been changed.
5.  **Apply Core Rule (Priority 1):**
    *   Iterate through each location `(r, c)` in `center_7_locations`. Set `output_grid[r][c] = 6` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.
    *   Iterate through each location `(r, c)` in `outer_7_locations`. Set `output_grid[r][c] = 8` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.
6.  **Apply Vertical Neighbor Rule (Priority 2):**
    *   Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` in the grid.
    *   If `(r, c)` is *not* in `modified_cells` AND the `input_grid[r][c]` value is `8`:
        *   Check if the cell directly above `(r-1, c)` or directly below `(r+1, c)` exists and is in `center_7_locations`.
        *   If yes, set `output_grid[r][c] = 6` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.
7.  **Apply Adjacent Neighbor Rule (Priority 3):**
    *   Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` in the grid.
    *   If `(r, c)` is *not* in `modified_cells` AND the `input_grid[r][c]` value is *not* `0`:
        *   Check if `(r, c)` is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to *any* location present in the `outer_7_locations` set.
        *   If yes, set `output_grid[r][c] = 3` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.
8.  **Apply Copy Rule (Priority 4):** All cells not added to `modified_cells` retain their original value (which they already have from the initial copy).
9.  Return the final `output_grid`.
