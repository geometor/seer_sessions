Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of numbers (representing colors or states). The dimensions remain the same.
2.  **Key Pattern:** The core pattern in the input seems to be horizontal sequences of `7 7 7`.
3.  **Transformation Colors:**
    *   `7`: The primary color being transformed.
    *   `8`: Acts as a replacement color for the outer `7`s and sometimes as a background color that gets modified.
    *   `6`: A new color appearing in the output, replacing the middle `7` and sometimes replacing `8`s vertically adjacent to the middle `7`.
    *   `3`: A color that appears in the output, often replacing other colors (`0`, `8`, `3`) adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to the original outer `7` locations.
    *   `0`: Background color, sometimes changed to `3` if adjacent to outer `7` locations.
4.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation involves several rules applied based on the position relative to the `7 7 7` patterns.
    *   A direct replacement rule for `7 7 7`.
    *   A rule affecting `8`s vertically adjacent to the *center* of the pattern.
    *   A rule affecting *any* color adjacent (including diagonals) to the *outer* parts of the pattern.
    *   A precedence or interaction logic seems necessary when a cell qualifies for multiple rules.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions (height, width)
    - cells containing single digits (0-8)
Objects:
  - Pattern:
      Type: Horizontal sequence
      Value: [7, 7, 7]
      Properties:
        - center_cell_location: (r, c)
        - outer_cell_locations: [(r, c-1), (r, c+1)]
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all instances of the [7, 7, 7] Pattern in the input grid.
  - Transform: Modify cell values in the output grid based on proximity and value relative to identified patterns.
  - Rules:
      - Rule_Core:
          Input: Cells at outer_cell_locations and center_cell_location of a Pattern.
          Output: Change outer cells to 8, center cell to 6.
          Priority: Highest.
      - Rule_Vertical_Neighbor:
          Input: Cell (r_neighbor, c_center) where input value is 8 AND (r_neighbor, c_center) is vertically adjacent to a center_cell_location (r_center, c_center).
          Output: Change cell (r_neighbor, c_center) to 6.
          Priority: Medium-High (overrides Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor if conflict involves same-row orthogonal Outer 7).
      - Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor:
          Input: Cell (r_adj, c_adj) that is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any outer_cell_location from any Pattern.
          Output: Change cell (r_adj, c_adj) to 3.
          Priority: Medium-Low (overridden by Rule_Vertical_Neighbor if conflict involves same-row orthogonal Outer 7, overrides Copy).
      - Rule_Copy:
          Input: Any cell not modified by other rules.
          Output: Keep the original input value.
          Priority: Lowest.
Relationships:
  - Adjacency:
      Type: Orthogonal (Up, Down, Left, Right)
      Used_by: Rule_Vertical_Neighbor (specifically vertical), Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor (conflict resolution part)
  - Adjacency:
      Type: Orthogonal and Diagonal (8 neighbors)
      Used_by: Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor (initial condition)
  - Proximity: Relative positioning to center_cell_location and outer_cell_locations drives the application of rules.
  - Conflict Resolution: Specific conditions determine precedence when a cell meets criteria for both Rule_Vertical_Neighbor and Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find all locations `(r, c)` which are the center of a horizontal `7 7 7` pattern in the input grid. Store these as `Center7Locations`.
3.  Identify all corresponding left `(r, c-1)` and right `(r, c+1)` locations for each center found. Store these as `Outer7Locations`.
4.  Create a temporary record of changes based on the following rules, evaluated for *every* cell `(r, c)` using the *input* grid values and locations identified above:
    a.  **Core Change:** If `(r, c)` is in `Center7Locations`, record a change to `6`. If `(r, c)` is in `Outer7Locations`, record a change to `8`.
    b.  **Vertical 6 Change:** If the input value at `(r, c)` is `8` AND `(r, c)` is vertically adjacent to any location in `Center7Locations`, record a change to `6`.
    c.  **Adjacent 3 Change:** If `(r, c)` is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any location in `Outer7Locations`, record a change to `3`. Also note if any of the triggering `Outer7Locations` were *orthogonally* adjacent and in the *same row* `r`.
5.  Apply the recorded changes to the output grid using the following precedence for each cell `(r, c)`:
    a.  If a **Core Change** (to 8 or 6) was recorded for `(r, c)`, apply it.
    b.  Else if both a **Vertical 6 Change** and an **Adjacent 3 Change** were recorded:
        i.  If the **Adjacent 3 Change** was triggered by an *orthogonal* neighbor in the *same row* `r`, apply the **Vertical 6 Change** (output is 6).
        ii. Otherwise, apply the **Adjacent 3 Change** (output is 3).
    c.  Else if only a **Vertical 6 Change** was recorded, apply it (output is 6).
    d.  Else if only an **Adjacent 3 Change** was recorded, apply it (output is 3).
    e.  Else (no changes recorded for this cell), keep the original input value (already copied in step 1).
6.  Return the final output grid.
```python

"""
Transforms a grid based on the location of horizontal '7 7 7' patterns.

1.  Identifies all horizontal sequences of '7 7 7' in the input grid.
2.  Modifies the grid based on proximity to these patterns:
    a.  The outer '7's of the pattern are changed to '8'.
    b.  The center '7' of the pattern is changed to '6'.
    c.  Input '8's vertically adjacent to the center '7' of a pattern are changed to '6'.
    d.  Any cell (regardless of initial value) orthogonally or diagonally adjacent 
        to the *outer* '7's of a pattern is changed to '3'.
3.  Handles precedence:
    a.  The core '7 7 7' transformation (to '8 6 8') takes highest priority.
    b.  If a cell qualifies for both the vertical '6' change (Rule 2c) and the 
        adjacent '3' change (Rule 2d):
        i.  If the adjacent '3' change was triggered by an outer '7' in the *same row* 
            (i.e., horizontally adjacent), the vertical '6' change takes precedence.
        ii. Otherwise (triggered by diagonal or different row outer '7'), the adjacent '3' 
            change takes precedence.
    c.  If a cell qualifies for only one of Rule 2c or 2d, that rule is applied.
    d.  If a cell is not affected by any rule, its value remains unchanged.

## Assessment and Strategy

The previous code failed significantly, indicating a misunderstanding of the transformation rules, particularly regarding the generation of the number `3` and the precedence between different rules. The generated output contained far too many `3`s, overwriting correct values generated by other rules (like the vertical `6` rule) and applying the rule to cells where it shouldn't have (like input `0`s in some cases).

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Rule Definitions:** Re-analyze the input/output pairs focusing on the conditions under which each output number (especially `3` and `6`) appears relative to the input `7 7 7` patterns.
2.  **Clarify Precedence:** Establish a strict order of operations for applying the rules. The core `7 7 7 -> 8 6 8` change likely has the highest priority, followed by the vertical `6` change, and then the adjacent `3` change. Unaffected cells retain their original value.
3.  **Constrain Adjacent '3' Rule:** The rule causing cells adjacent to outer `7`s to become `3` needs constraints. Based on the analysis, it seems this rule should *not* apply if the original cell value is `0`. It also seems to have lower precedence than the vertical `6` rule.
4.  **Verify Edge Cases:** Pay close attention to cells at the grid boundaries and cells affected by multiple `7 7 7` patterns to ensure the rules and precedence handle them correctly. Address the unexplained `8`s appearing in corners of the expected output, possibly by treating them as data errors if they cannot be explained by a consistent rule.
5.  **Implement with Priority:** Use a method (like applying rules in strict order or calculating all potential changes and applying the highest priority one) to ensure correct precedence.

## Metrics

**Example 1:**
*   Input Size: 13x19
*   Output Size: 13x19
*   Code Output Match: False
*   Pixels Off: 124 / 247
*   Key Discrepancies:
    *   Code produced `3` where `8` (corners/edges), `6` (vertical adjacency), or `0` (original background) were expected.
    *   Code failed to produce `6` where expected due to vertical adjacency (e.g., (0,4), (2,4), (2,6)).
    *   Code incorrectly changed some `0`s to `3` (e.g., (12,3)).
    *   Unexplained `8`s in expected output corners (e.g., (0,0)).

**Example 2:**
*   Input Size: 11x16
*   Output Size: 11x16
*   Code Output Match: False
*   Pixels Off: 76 / 176
*   Key Discrepancies: Similar pattern to Example 1.
    *   Excessive `3`s generated by the code.
    *   Missing `6`s where vertical adjacency rule should apply (e.g., (0,4), (2,4), (2,12)).
    *   Incorrect change of `0` to `3` (e.g., (4,11)).
    *   Unexplained `8`s in expected output corners (e.g., (0,0)).

## YAML Facts

```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions (height, width)
    - cells containing single digits (0-8)
Objects:
  - Pattern:
      Type: Horizontal sequence
      Value: [7, 7, 7]
      Properties:
        - center_cell_location: (r, c) based on input grid
        - outer_cell_locations: [(r, c-1), (r, c+1)] based on input grid
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all instances of the [7, 7, 7] Pattern in the input grid.
  - Transform: Modify cell values in an output grid based on rules and precedence, using input grid values and pattern locations.
  - Rules (applied in order of priority):
      - Rule_Core:
          Input: Cell is an outer_cell_location or center_cell_location.
          Output: Change outer cells to 8, center cell to 6.
          Priority: 1 (Highest)
      - Rule_Vertical_Neighbor:
          Input: Input cell value is 8 AND cell is vertically adjacent to a center_cell_location.
          Output: Change cell to 6.
          Priority: 2
      - Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor:
          Input: Input cell value is NOT 0 AND cell is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any outer_cell_location.
          Output: Change cell to 3.
          Priority: 3
      - Rule_Copy:
          Input: Cell not modified by any higher priority rule.
          Output: Keep the original input value.
          Priority: 4 (Lowest)
Relationships:
  - Adjacency:
      Type: Orthogonal (Up, Down, Left, Right)
      Used_by: Rule_Vertical_Neighbor (specifically vertical adjacency to center_cell_location)
  - Adjacency:
      Type: Orthogonal and Diagonal (8 neighbors)
      Used_by: Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor (adjacency to outer_cell_location)
  - Precedence: Rules are evaluated and applied strictly in the order: Core -> Vertical_Neighbor -> Adjacent_Neighbor -> Copy. Once a rule modifies a cell, subsequent lower-priority rules do not affect it.
```

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a deep copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Identify all locations `(r, c)` which are the center of a horizontal `7 7 7` pattern in the `input_grid`. Store these as `center_7_locations`.
3.  Identify all corresponding left `(r, c-1)` and right `(r, c+1)` locations for each center found in the `input_grid`. Store these as `outer_7_locations`.
4.  Create a set `modified_cells` to keep track of cells that have already been changed.
5.  **Apply Core Rule (Priority 1):**
    *   Iterate through each location `(r, c)` in `center_7_locations`. Set `output_grid[r][c] = 6` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.
    *   Iterate through each location `(r, c)` in `outer_7_locations`. Set `output_grid[r][c] = 8` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.
6.  **Apply Vertical Neighbor Rule (Priority 2):**
    *   Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` in the grid.
    *   If `(r, c)` is *not* in `modified_cells` AND the `input_grid[r][c]` value is `8`:
        *   Check if the cell directly above `(r-1, c)` or directly below `(r+1, c)` exists and is in `center_7_locations`.
        *   If yes, set `output_grid[r][c] = 6` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.
7.  **Apply Adjacent Neighbor Rule (Priority 3):**
    *   Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` in the grid.
    *   If `(r, c)` is *not* in `modified_cells` AND the `input_grid[r][c]` value is *not* `0`:
        *   Check if `(r, c)` is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to *any* location present in the `outer_7_locations` set.
        *   If yes, set `output_grid[r][c] = 3` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.
8.  **Apply Copy Rule (Priority 4):** All cells not added to `modified_cells` retain their original value (which they already have from the initial copy).
9.  Return the final `output_grid`.

Transforms a grid based on the location of horizontal '7 7 7' patterns, applying rules in a specific order of precedence.

1.  Identifies all horizontal sequences of '7 7 7' in the input grid.
2.  Applies transformation rules in the following priority order:
    a.  Core Rule: The outer '7's of the pattern are changed to '8', and the center '7' is changed to '6'. Cells modified by this rule are finalized.
    b.  Vertical Neighbor Rule: If an *input* cell value is '8' AND it is vertically adjacent to the *center* '7' of a pattern (identified in step 1) AND the cell was not modified by the Core Rule, it is changed to '6'. Cells modified by this rule are finalized.
    c.  Adjacent Neighbor Rule: If an *input* cell value is *not* '0' AND it is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any *outer* '7' of a pattern (identified in step 1) AND the cell was not modified by previous rules, it is changed to '3'. Cells modified by this rule are finalized.
    d.  Copy Rule: Any cell not modified by the above rules retains its original input value.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code attempts failed to accurately replicate the transformation. The core logic (`777` -> `868`) and the vertical neighbor rule (`8` next to center `7` -> `6`) appear relatively stable. However, the rule governing the appearance of the number `3` and the preservation of original numbers (especially `8`, `3`, and `0`) adjacent to the `777` patterns is complex and was incorrectly modeled.

The key challenges identified:
1.  **Adjacent '3' Rule:** The conditions under which a cell adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to an *outer* `7` becomes `3` are unclear. Simple adjacency leads to too many changes, while constraints based on the input value (e.g., "not 0", "not 8") fail to match the expected output consistently across examples.
2.  **Precedence:** While a priority order (Core > Vertical 6 > Adjacent 3) seems logical for cells affected by multiple potential rules, the exact definition of the lower-priority "Adjacent 3" rule remains the main issue. The complex precedence logic from the first attempt also failed.
3.  **Unexplained Changes/Preservations:** Several cells in the expected output, particularly `8`s that remain `8` despite being adjacent to outer `7`s, and the `(0,0)` change from `3` to `8` in both examples, cannot be explained by the currently hypothesized rules. These might indicate missing rules or potential inconsistencies/noise in the training data.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Solidify Core Rules:** Maintain the highest priority for the Core (`777` -> `868`) and Vertical Neighbor (`8` -> `6`) rules.
2.  **Simplify Adjacent Rule:** Implement the simplest version of the Adjacent Neighbor rule: Any cell adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to an outer `7`, if not modified by a higher priority rule, becomes `3`. This is based on the observation that many cells *do* follow this pattern, even though it creates known conflicts with the expected output for other cells.
3.  **Strict Priority:** Enforce the priority strictly: Core -> Vertical -> Adjacent.
4.  **Analyze Discrepancies:** Use the output generated by this simplified model to precisely pinpoint the remaining discrepancies against the expected output. This analysis will be crucial for the *next* iteration to potentially identify the more subtle constraints or additional rules governing the transformation. For this iteration, we acknowledge the model is likely incomplete.

## Metrics

Metrics based on the *logic* of the **second code attempt** (code_01.py logic with strict R1>R2>R3 priority and simple R3: adj->3):

*(Simulation of this logic suggests it produces results similar to the first failed trace, with many incorrect '3's. The exact pixel counts below are based on that simulated outcome, assuming the previous trace was representative of this logic)*

**Example 1:**
*   Input Size: 13x19
*   Output Size: 13x19
*   Simulated Code Output Match: False
*   Estimated Pixels Off: ~76 (Similar to first trace discrepancy after correcting its own internal inconsistencies)
*   Key Discrepancies (Simulated Logic vs Expected):
    *   Cells like `(0,1)` (In 8), `(0,3)` (In 8) become `3` in simulation but should be `8`.
    *   Cell `(0,0)` (In 3) becomes `3` in simulation but should be `8`.
    *   Rule 2 (Vertical 6) correctly changes cells like `(0,4)`, `(2,4)` to `6`.
    *   Rule 3 correctly changes cells like `(2,0)`, `(6,1)`, `(12,9)` to `3`.

**Example 2:**
*   Input Size: 11x16
*   Output Size: 11x16
*   Simulated Code Output Match: False
*   Estimated Pixels Off: ~52 (Similar to first trace discrepancy after corrections)
*   Key Discrepancies (Simulated Logic vs Expected):
    *   Cells like `(0,1)` (In 8), `(0,3)` (In 8) become `3` but should be `8`.
    *   Cells like `(4,15)` (In 3) become `3` (correct), `(4,14)` (In 8) become `3` (correct).
    *   Cell `(0,0)` (In 3) becomes `3` but should be `8`.

      Value: [7, 7, 7]
      Properties:
        - center_cell_location: (r, c) based on input grid
        - outer_cell_locations: [(r, c-1), (r, c+1)] based on input grid
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all instances of the [7, 7, 7] Pattern in the input grid.
  - Transform: Modify cell values in an output grid based on rules and precedence, using input grid values and pattern locations.
  - Rules (applied in order of priority):
      - Rule_Core (Priority 1):
          Input: Cell is an outer_cell_location or center_cell_location.
          Output: Change outer cells to 8, center cell to 6.
      - Rule_Vertical_Neighbor (Priority 2):
          Input: Input cell value is 8 AND cell is vertically adjacent to a center_cell_location.
          Output: Change cell to 6.
      - Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor (Priority 3):
          Input: Cell is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any outer_cell_location.
          Output: Change cell to 3.
      - Rule_Copy (Priority 4):
          Input: Cell not modified by any higher priority rule.
          Output: Keep the original input value.
Relationships:
  - Adjacency:
      Type: Orthogonal (Up, Down)
      Used_by: Rule_Vertical_Neighbor (specifically vertical adjacency to center_cell_location)
  - Adjacency:
      Type: Orthogonal and Diagonal (8 neighbors)
      Used_by: Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor (adjacency to outer_cell_location)
  - Precedence: Rules are evaluated and applied strictly in the order: Core -> Vertical_Neighbor -> Adjacent_Neighbor -> Copy. Once a rule modifies a cell, subsequent lower-priority rules do not affect it for that cell.
Notes:
  - The definition of Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor is simplified and known to produce discrepancies compared to the expected output, particularly regarding input cells with value 8 or 3 that remain unchanged in the expected output despite adjacency.
  - Unexplained behavior (e.g., input (0,0)=3 becoming output 8) exists in the examples and is not captured by these rules.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a deep copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Identify all locations `(r, c)` which are the center of a horizontal `7 7 7` pattern in the `input_grid`. Store these as `center_7_locations`.
3.  Identify all corresponding left `(r, c-1)` and right `(r, c+1)` locations for each center found in the `input_grid`. Store these as `outer_7_locations`.
4.  Create a set `modified_cells` to keep track of cells that have already been changed by a higher-priority rule.
5.  **Apply Core Rule (Priority 1):**
    *   Iterate through each location `(r, c)` in `center_7_locations`. Set `output_grid[r][c] = 6` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.
    *   Iterate through each location `(r, c)` in `outer_7_locations`. Set `output_grid[r][c] = 8` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.
6.  **Apply Vertical Neighbor Rule (Priority 2):**
    *   Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` in the grid.
    *   If `(r, c)` is *not* in `modified_cells` AND the `input_grid[r][c]` value is `8`:
        *   Check if the cell directly above `(r-1, c)` or directly below `(r+1, c)` exists within the grid boundaries and is in `center_7_locations`.
        *   If yes, set `output_grid[r][c] = 6` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.
7.  **Apply Adjacent Neighbor Rule (Priority 3):**
    *   Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` in the grid.
    *   If `(r, c)` is *not* in `modified_cells`:
        *   Check if `(r, c)` is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to *any* location present in the `outer_7_locations` set.
        *   If yes, set `output_grid[r][c] = 3` and add `(r, c)` to `modified_cells`.
8.  **Apply Copy Rule (Priority 4):** All cells not added to `modified_cells` retain their original value (which they already have from the initial copy).
9.  Return the final `output_grid`.
