Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions (height, width)
    - cells containing single digits (0-8)
Objects:
  - Pattern:
      Type: Horizontal sequence
      Value: [7, 7, 7]
      Properties:
        - center_cell_location: (r, c)
        - outer_cell_locations: [(r, c-1), (r, c+1)]
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all instances of the [7, 7, 7] Pattern in the input grid.
  - Transform: Modify cell values in the output grid based on proximity and value relative to identified patterns.
  - Rules:
      - Rule_Core:
          Input: Cells at outer_cell_locations and center_cell_location of a Pattern.
          Output: Change outer cells to 8, center cell to 6.
          Priority: Highest.
      - Rule_Vertical_Neighbor:
          Input: Cell (r_neighbor, c_center) where input value is 8 AND (r_neighbor, c_center) is vertically adjacent to a center_cell_location (r_center, c_center).
          Output: Change cell (r_neighbor, c_center) to 6.
          Priority: Medium-High (overrides Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor if conflict involves same-row orthogonal Outer 7).
      - Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor:
          Input: Cell (r_adj, c_adj) that is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any outer_cell_location from any Pattern.
          Output: Change cell (r_adj, c_adj) to 3.
          Priority: Medium-Low (overridden by Rule_Vertical_Neighbor if conflict involves same-row orthogonal Outer 7, overrides Copy).
      - Rule_Copy:
          Input: Any cell not modified by other rules.
          Output: Keep the original input value.
          Priority: Lowest.
Relationships:
  - Adjacency:
      Type: Orthogonal (Up, Down, Left, Right)
      Used_by: Rule_Vertical_Neighbor (specifically vertical), Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor (conflict resolution part)
  - Adjacency:
      Type: Orthogonal and Diagonal (8 neighbors)
      Used_by: Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor (initial condition)
  - Proximity: Relative positioning to center_cell_location and outer_cell_locations drives the application of rules.
  - Conflict Resolution: Specific conditions determine precedence when a cell meets criteria for both Rule_Vertical_Neighbor and Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor.
