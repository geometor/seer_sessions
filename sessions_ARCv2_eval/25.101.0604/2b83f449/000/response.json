            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of numbers (representing colors or states). The dimensions remain the same.\n2.  **Key Pattern:** The core pattern in the input seems to be horizontal sequences of `7 7 7`.\n3.  **Transformation Colors:**\n    *   `7`: The primary color being transformed.\n    *   `8`: Acts as a replacement color for the outer `7`s and sometimes as a background color that gets modified.\n    *   `6`: A new color appearing in the output, replacing the middle `7` and sometimes replacing `8`s vertically adjacent to the middle `7`.\n    *   `3`: A color that appears in the output, often replacing other colors (`0`, `8`, `3`) adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to the original outer `7` locations.\n    *   `0`: Background color, sometimes changed to `3` if adjacent to outer `7` locations.\n4.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation involves several rules applied based on the position relative to the `7 7 7` patterns.\n    *   A direct replacement rule for `7 7 7`.\n    *   A rule affecting `8`s vertically adjacent to the *center* of the pattern.\n    *   A rule affecting *any* color adjacent (including diagonals) to the *outer* parts of the pattern.\n    *   A precedence or interaction logic seems necessary when a cell qualifies for multiple rules.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nGrid:\n  Properties:\n    - dimensions (height, width)\n    - cells containing single digits (0-8)\nObjects:\n  - Pattern:\n      Type: Horizontal sequence\n      Value: [7, 7, 7]\n      Properties:\n        - center_cell_location: (r, c)\n        - outer_cell_locations: [(r, c-1), (r, c+1)]\nActions:\n  - Identify: Locate all instances of the [7, 7, 7] Pattern in the input grid.\n  - Transform: Modify cell values in the output grid based on proximity and value relative to identified patterns.\n  - Rules:\n      - Rule_Core:\n          Input: Cells at outer_cell_locations and center_cell_location of a Pattern.\n          Output: Change outer cells to 8, center cell to 6.\n          Priority: Highest.\n      - Rule_Vertical_Neighbor:\n          Input: Cell (r_neighbor, c_center) where input value is 8 AND (r_neighbor, c_center) is vertically adjacent to a center_cell_location (r_center, c_center).\n          Output: Change cell (r_neighbor, c_center) to 6.\n          Priority: Medium-High (overrides Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor if conflict involves same-row orthogonal Outer 7).\n      - Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor:\n          Input: Cell (r_adj, c_adj) that is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any outer_cell_location from any Pattern.\n          Output: Change cell (r_adj, c_adj) to 3.\n          Priority: Medium-Low (overridden by Rule_Vertical_Neighbor if conflict involves same-row orthogonal Outer 7, overrides Copy).\n      - Rule_Copy:\n          Input: Any cell not modified by other rules.\n          Output: Keep the original input value.\n          Priority: Lowest.\nRelationships:\n  - Adjacency:\n      Type: Orthogonal (Up, Down, Left, Right)\n      Used_by: Rule_Vertical_Neighbor (specifically vertical), Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor (conflict resolution part)\n  - Adjacency:\n      Type: Orthogonal and Diagonal (8 neighbors)\n      Used_by: Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor (initial condition)\n  - Proximity: Relative positioning to center_cell_location and outer_cell_locations drives the application of rules.\n  - Conflict Resolution: Specific conditions determine precedence when a cell meets criteria for both Rule_Vertical_Neighbor and Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2.  Find all locations `(r, c)` which are the center of a horizontal `7 7 7` pattern in the input grid. Store these as `Center7Locations`.\n3.  Identify all corresponding left `(r, c-1)` and right `(r, c+1)` locations for each center found. Store these as `Outer7Locations`.\n4.  Create a temporary record of changes based on the following rules, evaluated for *every* cell `(r, c)` using the *input* grid values and locations identified above:\n    a.  **Core Change:** If `(r, c)` is in `Center7Locations`, record a change to `6`. If `(r, c)` is in `Outer7Locations`, record a change to `8`.\n    b.  **Vertical 6 Change:** If the input value at `(r, c)` is `8` AND `(r, c)` is vertically adjacent to any location in `Center7Locations`, record a change to `6`.\n    c.  **Adjacent 3 Change:** If `(r, c)` is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any location in `Outer7Locations`, record a change to `3`. Also note if any of the triggering `Outer7Locations` were *orthogonally* adjacent and in the *same row* `r`.\n5.  Apply the recorded changes to the output grid using the following precedence for each cell `(r, c)`:\n    a.  If a **Core Change** (to 8 or 6) was recorded for `(r, c)`, apply it.\n    b.  Else if both a **Vertical 6 Change** and an **Adjacent 3 Change** were recorded:\n        i.  If the **Adjacent 3 Change** was triggered by an *orthogonal* neighbor in the *same row* `r`, apply the **Vertical 6 Change** (output is 6).\n        ii. Otherwise, apply the **Adjacent 3 Change** (output is 3).\n    c.  Else if only a **Vertical 6 Change** was recorded, apply it (output is 6).\n    d.  Else if only an **Adjacent 3 Change** was recorded, apply it (output is 3).\n    e.  Else (no changes recorded for this cell), keep the original input value (already copied in step 1).\n6.  Return the final output grid."
