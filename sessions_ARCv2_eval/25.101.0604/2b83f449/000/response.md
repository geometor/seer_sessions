Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of numbers (representing colors or states). The dimensions remain the same.
2.  **Key Pattern:** The core pattern in the input seems to be horizontal sequences of `7 7 7`.
3.  **Transformation Colors:**
    *   `7`: The primary color being transformed.
    *   `8`: Acts as a replacement color for the outer `7`s and sometimes as a background color that gets modified.
    *   `6`: A new color appearing in the output, replacing the middle `7` and sometimes replacing `8`s vertically adjacent to the middle `7`.
    *   `3`: A color that appears in the output, often replacing other colors (`0`, `8`, `3`) adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to the original outer `7` locations.
    *   `0`: Background color, sometimes changed to `3` if adjacent to outer `7` locations.
4.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation involves several rules applied based on the position relative to the `7 7 7` patterns.
    *   A direct replacement rule for `7 7 7`.
    *   A rule affecting `8`s vertically adjacent to the *center* of the pattern.
    *   A rule affecting *any* color adjacent (including diagonals) to the *outer* parts of the pattern.
    *   A precedence or interaction logic seems necessary when a cell qualifies for multiple rules.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions (height, width)
    - cells containing single digits (0-8)
Objects:
  - Pattern:
      Type: Horizontal sequence
      Value: [7, 7, 7]
      Properties:
        - center_cell_location: (r, c)
        - outer_cell_locations: [(r, c-1), (r, c+1)]
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all instances of the [7, 7, 7] Pattern in the input grid.
  - Transform: Modify cell values in the output grid based on proximity and value relative to identified patterns.
  - Rules:
      - Rule_Core:
          Input: Cells at outer_cell_locations and center_cell_location of a Pattern.
          Output: Change outer cells to 8, center cell to 6.
          Priority: Highest.
      - Rule_Vertical_Neighbor:
          Input: Cell (r_neighbor, c_center) where input value is 8 AND (r_neighbor, c_center) is vertically adjacent to a center_cell_location (r_center, c_center).
          Output: Change cell (r_neighbor, c_center) to 6.
          Priority: Medium-High (overrides Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor if conflict involves same-row orthogonal Outer 7).
      - Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor:
          Input: Cell (r_adj, c_adj) that is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any outer_cell_location from any Pattern.
          Output: Change cell (r_adj, c_adj) to 3.
          Priority: Medium-Low (overridden by Rule_Vertical_Neighbor if conflict involves same-row orthogonal Outer 7, overrides Copy).
      - Rule_Copy:
          Input: Any cell not modified by other rules.
          Output: Keep the original input value.
          Priority: Lowest.
Relationships:
  - Adjacency:
      Type: Orthogonal (Up, Down, Left, Right)
      Used_by: Rule_Vertical_Neighbor (specifically vertical), Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor (conflict resolution part)
  - Adjacency:
      Type: Orthogonal and Diagonal (8 neighbors)
      Used_by: Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor (initial condition)
  - Proximity: Relative positioning to center_cell_location and outer_cell_locations drives the application of rules.
  - Conflict Resolution: Specific conditions determine precedence when a cell meets criteria for both Rule_Vertical_Neighbor and Rule_Adjacent_Neighbor.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find all locations `(r, c)` which are the center of a horizontal `7 7 7` pattern in the input grid. Store these as `Center7Locations`.
3.  Identify all corresponding left `(r, c-1)` and right `(r, c+1)` locations for each center found. Store these as `Outer7Locations`.
4.  Create a temporary record of changes based on the following rules, evaluated for *every* cell `(r, c)` using the *input* grid values and locations identified above:
    a.  **Core Change:** If `(r, c)` is in `Center7Locations`, record a change to `6`. If `(r, c)` is in `Outer7Locations`, record a change to `8`.
    b.  **Vertical 6 Change:** If the input value at `(r, c)` is `8` AND `(r, c)` is vertically adjacent to any location in `Center7Locations`, record a change to `6`.
    c.  **Adjacent 3 Change:** If `(r, c)` is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any location in `Outer7Locations`, record a change to `3`. Also note if any of the triggering `Outer7Locations` were *orthogonally* adjacent and in the *same row* `r`.
5.  Apply the recorded changes to the output grid using the following precedence for each cell `(r, c)`:
    a.  If a **Core Change** (to 8 or 6) was recorded for `(r, c)`, apply it.
    b.  Else if both a **Vertical 6 Change** and an **Adjacent 3 Change** were recorded:
        i.  If the **Adjacent 3 Change** was triggered by an *orthogonal* neighbor in the *same row* `r`, apply the **Vertical 6 Change** (output is 6).
        ii. Otherwise, apply the **Adjacent 3 Change** (output is 3).
    c.  Else if only a **Vertical 6 Change** was recorded, apply it (output is 6).
    d.  Else if only an **Adjacent 3 Change** was recorded, apply it (output is 3).
    e.  Else (no changes recorded for this cell), keep the original input value (already copied in step 1).
6.  Return the final output grid.
