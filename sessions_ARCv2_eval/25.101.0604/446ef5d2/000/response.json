Output dimensions match input.\n    - background_color: '8'\n    - object_colors: Digits other than '8' (e.g., '0', '2', '3', '4', '7', '9').\n  transformation_hints:\n    - Selection: Input objects are filtered based on some criteria. In train_2, objects containing both '3' and '9' seem relevant. In train_1, the largest object or the one enclosed by '7's might be relevant.\n    - Bounding_Box: The output object occupies a rectangular bounding box. In train_2, this box seems derived from the bounding box of the *centers* of the selected input objects. The method for train_1 is less clear.\n    - Population: The output bounding box is filled. The border often has a specific color ('7' in train_1, '3' in train_2). The interior is filled based on the selected input objects, possibly involving default fills ('9' in train_2 interior) and overlays/copies from input objects relative to their centers.\n\nfacts:\n  - input_grid: A 2D array of integers.\n  - output_grid: A 2D array of integers with the same dimensions as the input.\n  - background_color: Integer '8'.\n  - objects:\n      - definition: Contiguous regions of cells in the input_grid with values not equal to background_color.\n      - properties:\n          - colors_present: Set of unique non-background colors within the object.\n          - bounding_box: Smallest rectangle enclosing the object.\n          - center: Geometric center coordinates of the object's cells.\n          - size: Number of cells in the object.\n  - selection_criteria:\n      - train_1: Seems related to size or enclosure (e.g., by color '7'). The largest object enclosed by '7's appears selected.\n      - train_2: Objects containing both color '3' and color '9'.\n  - output_object_definition:\n      - location_and_size: Defined by a bounding box.\n      - bounding_box_determination (hypothesis for train_2): Calculate the bounding box of the geometric centers of the selected input objects.\n      - content:\n          - border_color: A specific color ('7' for train_1, '3' for train_2).\n          - interior_fill: Combination of default fill color ('9' for train_2) and colors copied/overlaid from selected input objects based on relative positions.\n\nnatural_language_program:\n  - Identify all contiguous regions of non-background ('8') cells in the input grid (input objects).\n  - Filter these input objects based on specific criteria relevant to the task example (e.g., for train_2, keep objects containing both '3' and '9'; for train_1, potentially select the largest object enclosed by '7's).\n  - Calculate the geometric center for each selected input object.\n  - Determine the bounding box enclosing all calculated centers. This defines the output object's bounding box.\n  - Create the output grid, initially filled with the background color ('8').\n  - Populate the determined bounding box in the output grid:\n      - Set the cells forming the border of the bounding box to a specific color ('3' for train_2, '7' for train_1).\n      - Fill the interior cells of the bounding box according to a rule:\n          - For train_2: Fill with a default color ('9'), then iterate through the selected input objects. For each '3' cell within an input object, find its corresponding relative position within the output bounding box (based on center mapping) and set that output cell to '3', overwriting the default '9'.\n          - For train_1: The interior fill appears more complex, possibly involving copying or transforming the content of the primary selected input object into the output bounding box, potentially scaling or modifying it. (The exact rule is less certain).\n```"
