general_assessment:
  - The primary error is an `ImportError: No module named 'skimage'`, preventing code execution and validation. This needs to be resolved in the execution environment.
  - Assuming the code could run, the logic was heavily based on observations from `train_2` (filtering objects by colors {3, 9}, calculating bbox from centers, specific border/fill/overlay colors).
  - This logic does not align well with `train_1`, which appears to involve different selection criteria (possibly size or enclosure), different output colors ('7' border), and a different method for constructing the output object's content (more like a transformation or copy of the input object, not just fill + overlay).
  - Strategy:
    1. Address the import error in the coder phase.
    2. Re-evaluate the object selection, bounding box calculation, and content population steps to find a more general rule or identify distinct rulesets for different input patterns.
    3. Recognize that the transformation might be conditional based on properties of the input objects found.

metrics:
  - Note: Code execution failed due to `ImportError`. Metrics are based on manual analysis guided by the intended code logic and previous observations.

  - **train_1:**
    - Input Grid: 12x20. Background: 8.
    - Input Objects: Multiple non-8 regions. Key object appears to be large, containing {0, 2, 7}, roughly R[2-10], C[9-18]. Other smaller objects exist ({7}, {2}, {4}).
    - Selection Hypothesis: Largest object containing '0', or perhaps the object most centrally located or enclosed by '7's.
    - Output Grid: 12x20. Background: 8.
    - Output Object: Single region within R[3-9], C[7-18]. Border color '7'. Interior contains {0, 2, 7}, visually similar but not identical in shape/content to a section of the main input object.
    - Code Applicability (Train_2 logic): Fails. Selection criteria ({3, 9}) don't match. Bbox calculation based on centers is likely incorrect for a single selected object. Output colors (border 3, fill 9, overlay 3) are wrong.

  - **train_2:**
    - Input Grid: 10x10. Background: 8.
    - Input Objects: Multiple non-8 regions. Key objects are those containing both '3' and '9'. Two such objects exist: top-right approx R[1-3], C[6-9] (center ~2.5, 7.5); bottom-right approx R[6-8], C[7-9] (center ~7, 8).
    - Selection Hypothesis: Objects containing both '3' and '9'. This seems correct.
    - Output Grid: 10x10. Background: 8.
    - Output Object: Single square region R[2-7], C[2-7]. Border color '3'. Interior color '9' with specific '3's overlaid.
    - Code Applicability (Train_2 logic):
        - Selection: Correctly identifies the two {3, 9} objects.
        - Bbox Calculation: The method `bbox enclosing rounded centers` needs verification. Centers (2.5, 7.5), (7, 8). Rounded min/max centers R[3, 7], C[8, 8]. This doesn't produce the output R[2-7], C[2-7]. The exact bbox calculation method remains uncertain but seems related to the selected object centers.
        - Population: Border '3', Fill '9' seem correct. Overlay '3' logic (relative positioning from centers) produced results close but not identical to the output in manual analysis; requires refinement or correction.

facts:
  - input_grid: A 2D array of integers.
  - output_grid: A 2D array of integers with the same dimensions as the input.
  - background_color: Integer '8'.
  - objects:
      - definition: Contiguous regions of cells (4-connectivity) in the input_grid with values not equal to background_color.
      - properties:
          - colors_present: Set of unique non-background colors within the object.
          - bounding_box: Smallest rectangle (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) enclosing the object.
          - center: Geometric centroid coordinates (row, col) - potentially fractional.
          - size: Number of cells in the object.
  - transformation_steps:
      - 1_find_objects: Identify all objects in the input grid.
      - 2_select_objects: Filter objects based on task-specific criteria.
          - criteria_train_1: Seems related to size and/or contained colors (e.g., largest object containing '0' or enclosed by '7's). Leads to selecting *one* main object.
          - criteria_train_2: Must contain both colors '3' and '9'. Leads to selecting *multiple* objects.
      - 3_determine_output_bbox: Calculate the bounding box for the single output object. The method depends on the selection outcome:
          - method_train_1: Appears derived from the bounding box of the single selected input object, but modified (e.g., shifted, resized). Exact method unclear.
          - method_train_2: Appears derived from the geometric centers of the multiple selected input objects. The exact calculation mapping centers to the output box R[2,7] C[2,7] is unclear. Resulting box is 6x6.
      - 4_create_output_grid: Initialize grid with background_color.
      - 5_populate_output_bbox: Fill the calculated bounding box.
          - border_color_train_1: '7'
          - border_color_train_2: '3'
          - interior_fill_train_1: Seems to be a transformed copy of the selected input object's content.
          - interior_fill_train_2: Default fill color '9', with color '3' overlaid. The positions of overlaid '3's are related to the positions of '3's within the selected input objects relative to their centers, mapped to the output box. Exact mapping logic needs refinement.

natural_language_program:
  - 1. Identify all connected regions (objects) of non-background ('8') cells using 4-way connectivity in the input grid. For each object, determine its properties (colors, bounding box, center, size).
  - 2. Select the relevant input object(s) based on criteria that depend on the input pattern:
      - **IF** objects containing both colors '3' and '9' exist (like train_2): Select all such objects.
      - **ELSE IF** objects containing color '0' exist (potential rule for train_1): Select the largest such object.
      - **ELSE** (Default/Fallback): Handle cases not covered (e.g., return input or empty grid - current examples don't cover this well).
  - 3. Determine the bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) for the single output object based on the selected object(s):
      - **IF** multiple objects were selected (train_2 case): Calculate the output bounding box based on the geometric centers of these objects. (The precise calculation method, resulting in a 6x6 box at R[2,7], C[2,7] for train_2, needs further investigation).
      - **IF** a single object was selected (train_1 case): Calculate the output bounding box based on the properties (e.g., bounding box, shape) of the single selected input object, potentially involving modifications like shifting or resizing. (The precise method, resulting in R[3,9], C[7,18] for train_1, needs further investigation).
  - 4. Create the output grid, initializing all cells to the background color ('8').
  - 5. Populate the determined output bounding box in the output grid:
      - **IF** multiple objects were selected (train_2 case):
          - Draw the border of the bounding box with color '3'.
          - Fill the interior of the bounding box with default color '9'.
          - For each selected input object, identify the cells containing color '3'. Map these cells' positions (relative to their object's center) to positions within the output bounding box (relative to the output box's center) and change the output cell color to '3'. (The exact mapping logic needs refinement).
      - **IF** a single object was selected (train_1 case):
          - Draw the border of the bounding box with color '7'.
          - Fill the interior by copying or transforming the content of the selected input object into the output bounding box. (The exact transformation/copy logic needs refinement).
