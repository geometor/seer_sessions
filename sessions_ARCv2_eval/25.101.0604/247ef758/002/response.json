            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified key structural elements: an axis column, a value column, boundary row preservation, and distinct handling for left and right zones relative to the axis. The provided Python code (`solve` function) attempts to implement this logic but relies on hardcoding three separate rule sets for the right-zone transformation, switching between them based on the value found in the axis column (`axis_value`).\n\nWhile this approach replicates the training examples, it represents overfitting rather than a general transformation rule. The core challenge remains: **determining the correct action (drawing a pattern, copying values, etc.) for the right zone based on the `selector_color` (from the value column) in a way that generalizes beyond the specific `axis_value` of the training examples.**\n\nThe execution error \"transform function not found\" indicates the execution environment expected a function named `transform`, while the provided code defined `solve`. Assuming the `solve` function's logic was intended, it would likely pass the specific training examples it was derived from, but fail on new tasks with different `axis_values` or different selector-to-action mappings.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Refine Axis Identification:** Ensure the `find_axis_column` logic is robust and correctly identifies the intended axis in various scenarios. The current logic (first column where middle rows share the *same* non-zero value) seems consistent with the examples but might need refinement for edge cases.\n2.  **Generalize Right-Zone Logic:** Move away from using `axis_value` to switch rule sets. Instead, seek a unified mechanism or a different contextual factor to determine the mapping between the `selector_color` and the corresponding right-zone action (pattern drawing, copying, etc.). This might involve looking for patterns or indicators within the input grid (perhaps boundary rows, dimensions, or color distributions) that define the \"task context\" or the specific glyph set to use.\n3.  **Parameterize Actions:** Instead of hardcoding patterns like `[4,4,4]`, define actions more abstractly (e.g., \"draw triple C\", \"copy last column\", \"copy from row 0 indices X,Y,Z\", \"draw pattern P aligned A\"). The specific parameters (C, P, X, Y, Z, A) should be derived from the input context or the selector color itself.\n\n## Metrics\n\nSince the code failed to execute due to the function name mismatch, direct execution metrics aren't available. However, based on the code's logic which explicitly handles the three training examples via conditional checks on `axis_value`:\n\n*   **Train 1:**\n    *   Input Dimensions: 12x18\n    *   Identified Axis Column (Expected): 3 (Value: 2)\n    *   Code Logic: Uses `axis_value == 2` block.\n    *   Predicted Result: **PASS** (Code logic matches example transformations).\n*   **Train 2:**\n    *   Input Dimensions: 10x15\n    *   Identified Axis Column (Expected): 4 (Value: 3)\n    *   Code Logic: Uses `axis_value == 3` block.\n    *   Predicted Result: **PASS** (Code logic matches example transformations).\n*   **Train 3:**\n    *   Input Dimensions: 10x14\n    *   Identified Axis Column (Expected): 3 (Value: 1)\n    *   Code Logic: Uses `axis_value == 1` block.\n    *   Predicted Result: **PASS** (Code logic matches example transformations).\n\n**Note:** These predicted PASS results only indicate that the hardcoded logic likely replicates the specific examples. They do *not* validate the generality of the solution.\n\n## Facts\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: input_grid\n    properties:\n      - grid of digits (colors)\n      - height H\n      - width W\n  - name: output_grid\n    properties:\n      - grid of digits (colors)\n      - height H\n      - width W\n      - initialized to 0s\n  - name: axis_column\n    properties:\n      - vertical column in the grid\n      - index: axis_col\n      - identified as the first column 'j' where input_grid[1:H-1, j] contains a single unique non-zero value\n      - copied from input to output for middle rows\n  - name: value_column\n    properties:\n      - vertical column in the input grid\n      - index: axis_col + 1\n      - contains selector_color values for middle rows\n      - copied from input to output for middle rows\n  - name: left_zone\n    properties:\n      - region of the grid\n      - columns: 0 to axis_col - 1\n  - name: right_zone\n    properties:\n      - region of the grid\n      - columns: axis_col + 2 to W - 1\n  - name: middle_rows\n    properties:\n      - rows: 1 to H - 2\n  - name: boundary_rows\n    properties:\n      - rows: 0 and H - 1\n  - name: selector_color\n    properties:\n      - color C found in input_grid[row, value_column_index] for a middle row\n      - determines the modification action for the output right_zone in that row\n  - name: right_zone_action\n    properties:\n      - an operation performed on the output grid's right_zone for a specific middle row\n      - determined by the selector_color C for that row\n      - can be: no operation, draw pattern, copy values from input (e.g., row 0, last column), conditional copy\n      - the specific mapping from selector_color to action appears task-dependent (different for each training example), but the factor determining the task context is unclear.\n\nactions:\n  - name: identify_axis_column\n    actor: system\n    operates_on: input_grid\n    description: Find the index (axis_col) of the vertical dividing column based on middle rows having a single unique non-zero value.\n  - name: copy_boundary_rows\n    actor: system\n    operates_on: input_grid, output_grid, boundary_rows\n    description: Copy the top and bottom rows from input to output.\n  - name: process_middle_row\n    actor: system\n    operates_on: input_grid, output_grid, middle_rows, axis_col\n    description: For each middle row 'r':\n      - clear_left_zone: Set output_grid[r, 0:axis_col] to 0.\n      - copy_axis_value: Set output_grid[r, axis_col] = input_grid[r, axis_col].\n      - copy_value_column_value: Set output_grid[r, axis_col+1] = input_grid[r, axis_col+1].\n      - determine_selector_color: C = input_grid[r, axis_col+1].\n      - apply_right_zone_action: Modify output_grid[r, axis_col+2:W] based on the action associated with C.\n  - name: apply_right_zone_action (details)\n    actor: system\n    operates_on: output_grid, input_grid, selector_color, right_zone, row index 'r'\n    description: Executes the specific action mapped from the selector_color C.

Initialize the `output_grid` with the same dimensions as the `input_grid` and fill it with zeros.\n2.  Handle edge cases: If the input grid has fewer than 3 rows, copy the input directly to the output and terminate.\n3.  Identify the `axis_column` index (`axis_col`) in the `input_grid`. This is the first column index where all middle rows (rows 1 to H-2) share the same single non-zero value.\n4.  Copy the entire top row (row 0) and bottom row (row H-1) from the `input_grid` to the `output_grid`.\n5.  For each middle row `r` (from row 1 to H-2):\n    a.  Copy the value from the `input_grid` at `(r, axis_col)` to the `output_grid` at `(r, axis_col)`.\n    b.  Identify the `value_column` index as `axis_col + 1`. If this index is within the grid bounds:\n        i.  Copy the value from the `input_grid` at `(r, value_column)` to the `output_grid` at `(r, value_column)`.\n        ii. Get the `selector_color` `C` from `input_grid[r, value_column]`.\n        iii. Determine the appropriate `right_zone_action` based on the `selector_color` `C` according to the rules specific to the current task context (Note: The exact mechanism for determining this context and the corresponding C-to-action map needs further generalization).\n        iv. Define the `right_zone` as columns from `axis_col + 2` to `W-1`.\n        v.  Execute the determined `right_zone_action` on the `output_grid` for row `r` within the bounds of the `right_zone`. Possible actions include:\n            *   **No operation:** If `C` is 0 or potentially matches another condition defined by the context. The `right_zone` remains zeros.\n            *   **Draw Pattern:** Retrieve a predefined 1D pattern and alignment (e.g., center, right) associated with `C` in the current context. Draw this pattern into the `right_zone`.\n            *   **Copy Values:** Copy specific values from elsewhere in the `input_grid` (e.g., from row 0 at certain indices, from the last column of the current row `r`) into the `right_zone`.\n            *   **Conditional Copy:** Perform a copy operation only if a specific condition (e.g., based on the content of the `left_zone` of the input row, or the row index `r`) is met.\n6.  Return the `output_grid`."
