Its horizontal position varies between tasks (col 3 in train_1, col 4 in train_2, col 3 in train_3). This column seems to act as a separator.\n4.  **Value Column:** The column immediately to the right of the axis column (the \"value column\") in the input plays a crucial role. The value in this column for a given row determines how the right side of that output row is constructed.\n5.  **Left Zone Modification:** The area to the left of the axis column in the input is mostly cleared (set to 0) in the output for the middle rows. There are some exceptions where parts of the left side are preserved, but the general rule seems to be clearing.\n6.  **Right Zone Modification:** The area to the right of the axis column is significantly modified. For the middle rows, the output pattern seems determined by the value `C` found in the corresponding row of the \"value column\" (`input[row, axis_col + 1]`). It appears that each non-zero color `C` maps to a specific, predefined shape or \"glyph\" for that task. This glyph, using color `C` (and sometimes other colors specific to the glyph, like in train_2 and train_3), is drawn onto the right side of the output row, typically centered horizontally within the right zone. If `C` is 0, the right zone remains 0.\n7.  **Boundary Rows:** The top and bottom rows of the grid seem to be treated specially: they are copied directly from the input to the output without modification.\n\n## Facts\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: input_grid\n    properties:\n      - grid of digits (colors)\n      - height H\n      - width W\n  - name: output_grid\n    properties:\n      - grid of digits (colors)\n      - height H\n      - width W\n  - name: axis_column\n    properties:\n      - vertical column in the grid\n      - index: axis_col\n      - largely preserved between input and output\n      - separates left and right zones\n  - name: value_column\n    properties:\n      - vertical column in the input grid\n      - index: axis_col + 1\n      - contains selector_color values\n  - name: left_zone\n    properties:\n      - region of the grid\n      - columns: 0 to axis_col - 1\n  - name: right_zone\n    properties:\n      - region of the grid\n      - columns: axis_col + 1 to W - 1\n  - name: middle_rows\n    properties:\n      - rows: 1 to H - 2\n  - name: boundary_rows\n    properties:\n      - rows: 0 and H - 1\n  - name: selector_color\n    properties:\n      - color C found in input[row, value_column_index]\n      - determines the glyph for the output right_zone\n  - name: glyph_pattern\n    properties:\n      - predefined 1D pattern of colors associated with a selector_color C\n      - specific to each task (train_1, train_2, train_3 have different glyph sets)\n      - drawn into the output right_zone\n\nactions:\n  - name: identify_axis_column\n    actor: system\n    operates_on: input_grid\n    description: Find the index (axis_col) of the vertical dividing column.\n  - name: copy_column\n    actor: system\n    operates_on: input_grid, output_grid, axis_column\n    description: Copy the axis_column from input to output.\n  - name: copy_rows\n    actor: system\n    operates_on: input_grid, output_grid, boundary_rows\n    description: Copy the top and bottom rows from input to output.\n  - name: clear_zone\n    actor: system\n    operates_on: output_grid, left_zone, middle_rows\n    description: Set the cells in the left_zone of middle_rows to 0.\n  - name: select_color\n    actor: system\n    operates_on: input_grid, value_column, middle_rows\n    description: Get the selector_color C for each middle row r from input[r, axis_col + 1].\n  - name: retrieve_glyph\n    actor: system\n    operates_on: selector_color\n    description: Look up the predefined glyph_pattern associated with the selector_color C for the current task.\n  - name: draw_glyph\n    actor: system\n    operates_on: output_grid, right_zone, middle_rows, glyph_pattern\n    description: Clear the right_zone and draw the retrieved glyph_pattern into the output row's right_zone, horizontally centered.\n\nrelationships:\n  - type: spatial\n    from: axis_column\n    to: left_zone, right_zone\n    description: axis_column separates left_zone and right_zone.\n  - type: determination\n    from: selector_color\n    to: glyph_pattern\n    description: The selector_color determines which glyph_pattern is used.\n  - type: placement\n    from: glyph_pattern\n    to: output_grid, right_zone\n    description: The glyph_pattern is placed within the right_zone of the output_grid.\n  - type: preservation\n    from: input_grid, boundary_rows\n    to: output_grid, boundary_rows\n    description: Boundary rows are preserved from input to output.\n```\n\n## Natural Language Program\n\n1.  Initialize the `output_grid` with the same dimensions as the `input_grid`.\n2.  Identify the vertical `axis_column` in the `input_grid` (this seems to be the first column from the left containing non-zero values that isn't part of a uniform border). Let its index be `axis_col`.\n3.  Copy the entire `axis_column` from the `input_grid` to the `output_grid` at index `axis_col`.\n4.  Copy the entire top row (row 0) and bottom row (row H-1) from the `input_grid` to the `output_grid`.\n5.  For each middle row `r` (from row 1 to H-2):\n    a.  Set all cells in the `left_zone` (columns 0 to `axis_col - 1`) of the `output_grid` at row `r` to 0 (background color).\n    b.  Get the `selector_color` `C` from the `input_grid` at position (`r`, `axis_col + 1`).\n    c.  Clear all cells in the `right_zone` (columns `axis_col + 1` to W-1) of the `output_grid` at row `r` to 0.\n    d.  If `C` is not 0:\n        i.  Retrieve the task-specific `glyph_pattern` associated with color `C`.\n        ii. Calculate the starting column index to place the `glyph_pattern` so it is horizontally centered within the `right_zone` for row `r`.\n        iii. Draw the `glyph_pattern` onto the `output_grid` at row `r` starting at the calculated column index."
