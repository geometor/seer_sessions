## General Assessment

The previous code correctly identified the existence of two distinct transformation modes based on the last non-zero row. However, it failed because:

1.  **Mode A Error (Independent Row):** The logic for rows where non-zero elements were *not* adjacent (`step > 1`) had an incorrect boundary condition. The fill sometimes needed to stop at the last non-zero element (`c_max`) and sometimes continue towards the end of the row (`row_width`), depending on whether all non-zero elements shared the same value.
2.  **Mode B Error (Reference Overlay):** The logic for overlaying was incorrect. It incorrectly handled input rows containing only zeros and didn't accurately combine the reference row pattern with the input row's non-zero elements.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Refine Mode A:** Adjust the boundary condition for the `step > 1` case.
    *   If `step > 1` and all non-zero values in the row are the same, the fill with the last value `V` should proceed in steps from `c_min` as long as the column index `c` is less than `row_width`.
    *   If `step > 1` and the non-zero values are *not* all the same, the fill with the last value `V` should proceed in steps from `c_min` only as long as the column index `c` is less than or equal to `c_max`.
2.  **Correct Mode B:** Implement the revised overlay logic:
    *   Initialize the output row with zeros.
    *   Copy the non-zero elements from the `reference_row` to the output row.
    *   Overwrite these with the non-zero elements from the corresponding `input_row`.
3.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect this corrected understanding.

      - For each (c, v) in non_zero_cells_ref: set output_row[c] = v.
      - Get non_zero_cells_input from input_row_data.
      - For each (c, v) in non_zero_cells_input: set output_row[c] = v (overwriting previous value if any).
      - Return output_row.
relationships:
  - The overall transformation strategy (Mode A or Mode B) depends entirely on whether the last non-zero row of the input grid contains adjacent non-zero elements.
  - Mode A transforms each row based only on its own internal non-zero patterns.
  - Mode B transforms each row by first establishing a base pattern from the non-zeros of the reference row and then overwriting it with the non-zeros from the current input row.
```

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialization:** Examine the input grid. Find the index and data of the last row containing any non-zero elements. Let this be `reference_row_data`. If no such row exists, return a copy of the input grid. Determine the width of the grid.
2.  **Mode Determination:** Analyze `reference_row_data`. Check if it contains any two non-zero elements located at adjacent column indices (e.g., column `c` and column `c+1`).
    *   If **yes** (adjacent non-zeros found), select **Mode A (Independent Row Transformation)**.
    *   If **no** (or if `reference_row_data` has fewer than 2 non-zero elements), select **Mode B (Reference Overlay Transformation)**.
3.  **Execute Transformation (Row by Row):**
    *   **Mode A (Independent Row Transformation):**
        a.  Create an empty output grid.
        b.  For each `input_row` in the input grid:
            i.  Find all non-zero cells `(column, value)` in the `input_row`, sorted by column (`nz`).
            ii. If `len(nz) < 2`, append a copy of the `input_row` to the output grid and continue to the next row.
            iii. Determine `c_min` (first non-zero column), `c_max` (last non-zero column), `V` (last non-zero value), `step` (column difference between first two non-zeros), and `all_same_value` (boolean).
            iv. Initialize `output_row` as a copy of `input_row`.
            v.  Apply filling logic based on `step`:
                *   If `step == 1`:
                    *   If `all_same_value` is True: Fill `output_row` from column `c_min` to the end of the row (width-1) with value `V`.
                    *   If `all_same_value` is False: Fill `output_row` from column `c_min` to `c_max` (inclusive) with value `V`.
                *   If `step > 1`:
                    *   Initialize `c = c_min`.
                    *   If `all_same_value` is True: While `c` is less than the row width, set `output_row[c] = V` and increment `c` by `step`.
                    *   If `all_same_value` is False: While `c` is less than or equal to `c_max`, set `output_row[c] = V` and increment `c` by `step`.
            vi. Append the modified `output_row` to the output grid.
        c.  Return the completed output grid.
    *   **Mode B (Reference Overlay Transformation):**
        a.  Create an empty output grid.
        b.  Find all non-zero cells `(column, value)` in the `reference_row_data` (`nz_ref`).
        c.  For each `input_row` in the input grid:
            i.  Initialize `output_row` as a list of zeros with the grid width.
            ii. For each `(c, v)` in `nz_ref`: Set `output_row[c] = v`.
            iii. Find all non-zero cells `(column, value)` in the current `input_row` (`nz_input`).
            iv. For each `(c, v)` in `nz_input`: Set `output_row[c] = v` (this overwrites any value previously set from `nz_ref` at the same column).
            v.  Append the finalized `output_row` to the output grid.
        d.  Return the completed output grid.
