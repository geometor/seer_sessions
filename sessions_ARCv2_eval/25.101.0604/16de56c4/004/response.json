            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the existence of two distinct transformation modes based on the last non-zero row. However, it failed because:\n\n1.  **Mode A Error (Independent Row):** The logic for rows where non-zero elements were *not* adjacent (`step > 1`) had an incorrect boundary condition. The fill sometimes needed to stop at the last non-zero element (`c_max`) and sometimes continue towards the end of the row (`row_width`), depending on whether all non-zero elements shared the same value.\n2.  **Mode B Error (Reference Overlay):** The logic for overlaying was incorrect. It incorrectly handled input rows containing only zeros and didn't accurately combine the reference row pattern with the input row's non-zero elements.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Refine Mode A:** Adjust the boundary condition for the `step > 1` case.\n    *   If `step > 1` and all non-zero values in the row are the same, the fill with the last value `V` should proceed in steps from `c_min` as long as the column index `c` is less than `row_width`.\n    *   If `step > 1` and the non-zero values are *not* all the same, the fill with the last value `V` should proceed in steps from `c_min` only as long as the column index `c` is less than or equal to `c_max`.\n2.  **Correct Mode B:** Implement the revised overlay logic:\n    *   Initialize the output row with zeros.\n    *   Copy the non-zero elements from the `reference_row` to the output row.\n    *   Overwrite these with the non-zero elements from the corresponding `input_row`.\n3.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect this corrected understanding.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics calculated using the provided `code_execution` results from the previous attempt:\n\n```tool_code\n# Metrics based on the failed code provided in the previous prompt\n\n# Example 1 Data\nexp1 = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0]]\nout1 = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0]]\n\n# Example 2 Data\nexp2 = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0],[0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0]]\nout2 = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0],[0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,5,0],[0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0],[0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0],[0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0],[0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0],[0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0]]\n\n# Example 3 Data\nexp3 = [[0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,2,0],[0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0],[0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,2,0],[0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0],[0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,2,0]]\nout3 = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,2,0],[0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,2,0],[0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,2,0],[0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,2,0]]\n\ndef count_diff(grid1, grid2):\n    diff = 0\n    if not grid1 or not grid2 or len(grid1) != len(grid2) or len(grid1[0]) != len(grid2[0]):\n        rows1 = len(grid1) if grid1 else 0\n        rows2 = len(grid2) if grid2 else 0\n        cols1 = len(grid1[0]) if rows1 > 0 and grid1[0] else 0\n        cols2 = len(grid2[0]) if rows2 > 0 and grid2[0] else 0\n        print(f\"Grid dimension mismatch or empty grid: Grid1({rows1}x{cols1}), Grid2({rows2}x{cols2})\")\n        # Estimate difference based on total possible pixels if dimensions mismatch significantly\n        # This part might need adjustment based on how to score size mismatches\n        return max(rows1*cols1, rows2*cols2) if rows1*cols1 != rows2*cols2 else 0\n\n    rows = len(grid1)\n    cols = len(grid1[0])\n    for r in range(rows):\n        if len(grid1[r]) != len(grid2[r]):\n             print(f\"Row length mismatch at row {r}: len(grid1[r])={len(grid1[r])}, len(grid2[r])={len(grid2[r])}\")\n             diff += max(len(grid1[r]), len(grid2[r])) # Penalize heavily for row mismatch\n             continue\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid1[r][c] != grid2[r][c]:\n                diff += 1\n    return diff\n\nprint(f\"Example 1 Pixels Off: {count_diff(exp1, out1)}\")\nprint(f\"Example 2 Pixels Off: {count_diff(exp2, out2)}\")\nprint(f\"Example 3 Pixels Off: {count_diff(exp3, out3)}\")\n\n```\n\n```text\nExample 1 Pixels Off: 1\nExample 2 Pixels Off: 17\nExample 3 Pixels Off: 13\n```\n\n## Facts\n\n```yaml\ntask_description: Transforms a 2D grid based on patterns in its rows, with the transformation mode determined by the adjacency of non-zero elements in the last non-zero row.\ngrid_properties:\n  dimensionality: 2D\n  cell_values: integers (0-9)\n  background_color: 0\nobjects:\n  -

Check if it contains any two non-zero elements located at adjacent column indices (e.g., column `c` and column `c+1`).\n    *   If **yes** (adjacent non-zeros found), select **Mode A (Independent Row Transformation)**.\n    *   If **no** (or if `reference_row_data` has fewer than 2 non-zero elements), select **Mode B (Reference Overlay Transformation)**.\n3.  **Execute Transformation (Row by Row):**\n    *   **Mode A (Independent Row Transformation):**\n        a.
