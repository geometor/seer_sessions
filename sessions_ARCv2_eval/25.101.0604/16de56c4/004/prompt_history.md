## Perception

The task involves transforming a 2D grid of numbers based on the patterns within each row. The transformation seems primarily horizontal, affecting cells within a row based on the positions and values of the non-zero elements in that row in the input grid.

Key observations across examples:

1.  **Row Independence:** The transformation appears to be applied independently to each row. The output of a row depends only on the input of that same row.
2.  **Non-Zero Elements Define Action:** The transformation is triggered and defined by the non-zero elements within a row. Rows containing only zeros remain unchanged.
3.  **Horizontal Span:** The transformation affects a horizontal segment of the row. This segment seems bounded by the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements in the input row.
4.  **Dominant Color:** The color (value) used for filling the affected segment seems determined by the value of the *rightmost* non-zero element in the input row.
5.  **Filling Mechanism:**
    *   In some cases (e.g., `train_1`, row 11: `8 8 ... 3 0` -> `3 3 ... 3 0`), all cells between the leftmost and rightmost non-zero input cells (inclusive) are filled with the dominant color.
    *   In other cases (e.g., `train_1`, row 4: `1 1 0...` -> `1 1 1...`), the fill seems to extend beyond the rightmost non-zero cell, potentially to the end of the grid. This might occur when all non-zero elements in the input row share the same value.
    *   In yet other cases (e.g., `train_1`, row 8: `9 0 9 ... 6 0 0` -> `6 0 6 0 6 0 6 0 0`), the filling within the span is selective, not painting over all original zeros. This selective filling is the hardest part to generalize.

Given the variations, the most consistent core operation appears to be filling the horizontal span defined by the outermost non-zero elements with the color of the rightmost element. However, there are modifications or alternative rules based on the homogeneity of colors or specific patterns within the row.

## Facts

```yaml
task_description: Transform each row of a grid based on its non-zero elements.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  cell_values: integers (0-9)
  background_color: 0
objects:
  - name: row
    properties:
      - contains_non_zero_elements: boolean
      - non_zero_cells: list of (column_index, value) tuples
      - leftmost_non_zero_column: integer (c_min)
      - rightmost_non_zero_column: integer (c_max)
      - rightmost_non_zero_value: integer (V)
      - distinct_non_zero_values: set of integers
actions:
  - name: process_row
    input: input_row_data
    output: output_row_data
    logic:
      - If the row contains no non-zero elements, the output row is identical to the input row (all zeros).
      - Otherwise, identify the column indices of the leftmost (c_min) and rightmost (c_max) non-zero elements.
      - Identify the value of the rightmost non-zero element (V).
      - Determine the set of distinct non-zero values in the row.
      - **Hypothesized Rule (needs refinement):**
        - Initialize the output row as a copy of the input row.
        - Fill the cells in the output row from column `c_min` to `c_max` (inclusive) with the value `V`.
        - (Note: This rule does not perfectly explain all examples, especially train_1 row 4 and row 8, suggesting conditional logic or alternative rules might apply based on factors like color uniformity or specific spacing patterns).
relationships:
  - The transformation of a cell depends only on the data within its row in the input grid.
  - The output value of cells within the horizontal span [c_min, c_max] is primarily determined by the value V from the rightmost non-zero cell at c_max.
```

## Natural Language Program

1.  Iterate through each row of the input grid independently.
2.  For the current row:
    a.  Find all non-zero cells and their column indices.
    b.  If there are no non-zero cells, copy the input row (all zeros) to the output row and proceed to the next row.
    c.  If there are non-zero cells:
        i.  Determine the column index of the leftmost non-zero cell (`c_min`).
        ii. Determine the column index of the rightmost non-zero cell (`c_max`).
        iii. Determine the value of the rightmost non-zero cell (`V`).
        iv. Create the output row by copying the input row.
        v.  Fill the segment of the output row from column `c_min` to `c_max` (inclusive) with the value `V`.
        vi. (Self-correction/Refinement Needed: The simple span fill described in step `v` does not perfectly match all examples. Cases like `train_1` row 4, row 8, and row 1 suggest additional conditions: perhaps if all non-zero values are the same, the fill extends to the grid edge, or perhaps the fill within the span `[c_min, c_max]` sometimes preserves original zeros based on specific criteria not yet fully understood).
3.  Combine the processed output rows to form the final output grid.
```python
import copy
import math

"""
The transformation rule depends on the pattern of non-zero elements in the last non-zero row of the input grid.

1. Find the last row in the input grid that contains any non-zero elements. Call this the 'reference row'.
2. Examine the non-zero elements in this reference row.
3. Check if any two *adjacent* non-zero elements in the reference row (when sorted by column index) have *consecutive* column indices.

4. **If YES (adjacent non-zeros exist in the reference row):**
   - The transformation is applied *independently* to each row.
   - For a given row:
     - Find all non-zero cells, sorted by column index: nz = [(c1, v1), (c2, v2), ...].
     - If no non-zero cells exist (len(nz) == 0), the row remains unchanged.
     - If only one non-zero cell exists (len(nz) == 1), the row remains unchanged.
     - If multiple non-zero cells exist (len(nz) > 1):
       - Determine the column of the first non-zero cell (c_min).
       - Determine the value of the *last* non-zero cell (V).
       - Calculate the difference in column indices between the first two non-zero cells (step = nz[1][0] - nz[0][0]).
       - Check if all non-zero cells in this row have the same value (all_same_value).
       - Initialize the output row as a copy of the input row.
       - Apply filling logic based on conditions:
         - If `all_same_value` is True AND `step == 1`: Fill the output row from column `c_min` to the *end of the row* with value `V`.
         - Else if `step == 1`: Fill the output row from column `c_min` to the column of the *last* non-zero cell (`c_max`) (inclusive) with value `V`.
         - Else (`step > 1`): Starting from column `c_min`, fill every `step`-th column with value `V`, continuing as long as the column index is within the row bounds.

5. **If NO (no adjacent non-zeros exist in the reference row):**
   - The transformation uses the reference row as a base pattern.
   - For each row in the input grid:
     - If the input row contains no non-zero elements, the output row is identical (all zeros).
     - If the input row *does* contain non-zero elements:
       - Start with a copy of the reference row.
       - Overwrite the values in this copied reference row at the column indices corresponding to the non-zero elements of the *original input row*, using the values from the original input row. The resulting row is the output row.

## General Assessment

The previous attempt correctly identified the existence of two distinct transformation modes but incorrectly determined the trigger condition and the exact logic for the second mode (Reference Row Overlay). The first mode (Independent Row Transformation) was mostly correct but had a boundary condition error in the "step > 1" case.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Correct the Trigger Condition:** The determining factor is whether the *last non-zero row* in the input grid contains *adjacent* non-zero elements (at column `c` and `c+1`). This will select between the two transformation modes.
2.  **Refine Mode 1 (Independent Row Transformation):** Adjust the logic for rows where the step between the first two non-zero elements is greater than 1. The fill should stop at the column of the last non-zero element (`c_max`), not necessarily the end of the row.
3.  **Correct Mode 2 (Reference Row Overlay):** Implement the logic where *every* output row starts as a copy of the last non-zero input row (the reference row), and then the non-zero values from the *corresponding input row* are overlaid onto it. Crucially, input rows containing only zeros should result in an output row that is a direct copy of the reference row.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect this corrected understanding.

      - For each input_row in input_grid:
        - Initialize output_row as a copy of reference_row.
        - Get non_zero_cells for the current input_row.
        - For each (c, v) in non_zero_cells: set output_row[c] = v.
        - Append output_row to output_grid.
      - Return output_grid.
relationships:
  - The overall transformation strategy depends on the adjacency of non-zero elements in the last non-zero row of the input grid.
  - If adjacent non-zeros exist in the last non-zero row, each row is transformed independently based on its own non-zero elements.
  - If no adjacent non-zeros exist in the last non-zero row, the entire grid is transformed row-by-row, using the last non-zero row as a template and overlaying non-zeros from the corresponding input row.
```

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialization:** Examine the input grid to find the last row containing any non-zero elements. Let this be the `reference_row` at `reference_row_index`. If no non-zero elements exist anywhere in the grid, return a copy of the input grid.
2.  **Mode Determination:** Analyze the `reference_row`. Check if there are any two non-zero elements located at adjacent column indices (e.g., column `c` and column `c+1`).
3.  **Execute Transformation based on Mode:**
    *   **Mode A: Adjacent Non-Zeros Found in `reference_row` (Independent Row Transformation):**
        a.  Create an empty output grid.
        b.  Iterate through each `input_row` of the input grid.
        c.  Find all non-zero cells `(column, value)` in the `input_row`, sorted by column. Let this list be `nz`.
        d.  If `len(nz) < 2`, append a copy of the `input_row` to the output grid.
        e.  If `len(nz) >= 2`:
            i.  Determine the first non-zero column `c_min = nz[0][0]`.
            ii. Determine the last non-zero column `c_max = nz[-1][0]`.
            iii. Determine the value of the last non-zero cell `V = nz[-1][1]`.
            iv. Calculate the difference between the column indices of the first two non-zero cells: `step = nz[1][0] - nz[0][0]`.
            v.  Check if all values in `nz` are the same (`all_same_value`).
            vi. Initialize `output_row` as a copy of `input_row`.
            vii. Apply filling logic:
                *   If `all_same_value` is True AND `step == 1`: Fill `output_row` from column `c_min` to the end of the row with value `V`.
                *   Else if `step == 1`: Fill `output_row` from column `c_min` to `c_max` (inclusive) with value `V`.
                *   Else (`step > 1`): Starting at column `c = c_min`, set `output_row[c] = V` and increment `c` by `step`, repeating as long as `c <= c_max`.
            viii. Append the modified `output_row` to the output grid.
        f.  Return the completed output grid.
    *   **Mode B: No Adjacent Non-Zeros Found in `reference_row` (Reference Row Overlay):**
        a.  Create an empty output grid.
        b.  Iterate through each `input_row` of the input grid (from top to bottom).
        c.  Initialize the `output_row` as a direct copy of the `reference_row`.
        d.  Find all non-zero cells `(column, value)` in the current `input_row`.
        e.  For each found non-zero cell `(column, value)`, update the `output_row` at the `column` index with the `value`.
        f.  Append the finalized `output_row` to the output grid.
        g.  Return the completed output grid.

    - Transform each row independently.
    - For a row:
        - Find non-zero cells nz = [(c, v), ...].
        - If len(nz) < 2, keep the row as is.
        - Otherwise, find c_min, c_max, V (last value), step (diff between first two cols), all_same_value.
        - Copy the input row to output_row.
        - If all_same_value and step == 1: fill output_row from c_min to end with V.
        - Else if step == 1: fill output_row from c_min to c_max with V.
        - Else (step > 1): fill output_row[c] = V for c = c_min, c_min + step, ..., up to c_max.
4.  If NO (no adjacent non-zeros in reference row), apply 'Mode B' (Reference Row Overlay):
    - For each input row:
        - If the input row is all zeros, the output row is all zeros.
        - Otherwise:
            - Start with a copy of the reference row as the output_row.
            - Find non-zero cells (c, v) in the input row.
            - For each (c, v), set output_row[c] = v.
