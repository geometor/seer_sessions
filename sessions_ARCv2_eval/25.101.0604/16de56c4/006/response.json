            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code implements a two-mode transformation based on whether the last non-zero row in the input grid contains adjacent non-zero elements.\n- **Mode A (Adjacent Non-Zeros in Reference Row):** This mode applies an independent transformation to each row based on its own non-zero elements (finding start, end, step, and filling based on value uniformity). Example 1 uses this mode, and the code correctly transforms it (0 pixels off). This suggests Mode A logic is accurate.\n- **Mode B (No Adjacent Non-Zeros in Reference Row):** This mode was intended to use the reference row as a base pattern and overlay the current input row's non-zeros. Examples 2 and 3 use this mode. The code, as written and executed previously, applies the following logic for Mode B: Start with an all-zero row, apply the non-zero values from the reference row, then overlay the non-zero values from the current input row.\n    - **Example 2 Analysis:** This logic fails significantly. The expected output often requires rows that were all-zero in the input to remain all-zero in the output, whereas the implemented logic populates them with the reference pattern. Furthermore, even for non-zero input rows, the overlay logic doesn't consistently produce the expected pattern (e.g., mismatches at column 15). The total pixel difference calculated using this logic is 20.\n    - **Example 3 Analysis:** This logic works for some rows (row 0, row 6) but fails for others. It incorrectly populates all-zero input rows (rows 1, 2) with the full reference pattern instead of the expected partial patterns. For non-zero input rows, it also produces mismatches by including reference row elements that should be zero in the output. The total pixel difference calculated using this logic is 7.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Retain Mode A:** The logic for `transform_independent_row` appears correct based on Example 1.\n2.  **Revise Mode B:** The current Mode B logic (\"Start 0s, Apply Ref NZ, Overlay Input NZ\") is flawed, particularly in handling all-zero input rows differently across examples and correctly determining which reference elements to keep.\n3.  **New Mode B Hypothesis:** A more accurate Mode B rule, considering the failures, might be:\n    *   If the current input row is all zeros, the output row is all zeros. (Addresses failures in Ex 2).\n    *   If the current input row has non-zeros:\n        *   Start the output row with the non-zero pattern of the reference row.\n        *   For each non-zero cell `(c, v)` in the input row, update the output row at column `c` to value `v`.\n    *   *Self-Correction:* This still doesn't explain Example 3, where all-zero input rows can produce non-zero outputs. The task likely has a more complex rule for Mode B or potentially more than two modes. However, given the need to provide a single program, the best approach is to implement the logic that minimizes errors across the examples. The rule described above (all-zero input -> all-zero output, else Ref base + Input overlay) addresses the largest error source (Ex 2 all-zero rows). We will proceed with this revised Mode B logic.\n4.  **Update Documentation:** Reflect the corrected Mode B logic in the YAML facts and natural language program.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics calculated based on the **previous code's logic** (Mode B = Start 0s, Apply Ref NZ, Overlay Input NZ), matching the prompt's reported results when recalculated:\n\n```tool_code\n# Metrics based on the code provided in the previous prompt\n\n# Example 1 Data (Mode A)\nexp1 = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0]]\nout1 = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0]] # Corrected based on Mode A logic\n\n# Example 2 Data (Mode B -

Find the index and data of the last row containing any non-zero elements. Let this be `reference_row_data`. If no such row exists, return a copy of the input grid. Determine the width of the grid.\n2.  **Mode Determination:** Analyze `reference_row_data`. Check if it contains any two non-zero elements located at adjacent column indices (e.g., column `c` and column `c+1`).\n    *   If **yes** (adjacent non-zeros found), select **Mode A (Independent Row Transformation)**.\n    *   If **no** (or if `reference_row_data` has fewer than 2 non-zero elements), select **Mode B (Reference Overlay Transformation - Revised)**.\n3.  **Execute Transformation (Row by Row):**\n    *   **Mode A (Independent Row Transformation):**\n        a.  Create an empty output grid.\n        b.  For each `input_row` in the input grid:\n            i.  Find all non-zero cells `(column, value)` in the `input_row`, sorted by column (`nz`).\n            ii. If `len(nz) < 2`, append a copy of the `input_row` to the output grid and continue to the next row.\n            iii. Determine `c_min` (first non-zero column), `c_max` (last non-zero column), `V` (last non-zero value), `step` (column difference between first two non-zeros), and `all_same_value` (boolean).\n            iv. Initialize `output_row` as a copy of `input_row`.\n            v.  Apply filling logic based on `step`:\n                *   If `step == 1`:\n                    *   If `all_same_value` is True: Fill `output_row` from column `c_min` to the end of the row (width-1) with value `V`.\n                    *   If `all_same_value` is False: Fill `output_row` from column `c_min` to `c_max` (inclusive) with value `V`.\n                *   If `step > 1`:\n                    *   Initialize `c = c_min`.\n                    *   If `all_same_value` is True: While `c` is less than the row width, set `output_row[c] = V` and increment `c` by `step`.\n                    *   If `all_same_value` is False: While `c` is less than or equal to `c_max`, set `output_row[c] = V` and increment `c` by `step`.\n            vi.

Create an empty output grid.\n        b.  For each `input_row` in the input grid:\n            i.  Check if the `input_row` consists entirely of zeros.\n            ii. If yes, append a new row containing only zeros (of the correct width) to the output grid.\n            iii. If no (the `input_row` contains non-zero values):\n                *   Initialize the `output_row` as a direct copy of the `reference_row_data`.\n                *   Find all non-zero cells `(column, value)` in the current `input_row` (`nz_input`).\n                *   For each `(c, v)` in `nz_input`: Set `output_row[c] = v` (overwriting the value inherited from the reference row).\n                *   Append the finalized `output_row` to the output grid.\n        c.
