## General Assessment

The provided code implements a two-mode transformation based on whether the last non-zero row in the input grid contains adjacent non-zero elements.
- **Mode A (Adjacent Non-Zeros in Reference Row):** This mode applies an independent transformation to each row based on its own non-zero elements (finding start, end, step, and filling based on value uniformity). Example 1 uses this mode, and the code correctly transforms it (0 pixels off). This suggests Mode A logic is accurate.
- **Mode B (No Adjacent Non-Zeros in Reference Row):** This mode was intended to use the reference row as a base pattern and overlay the current input row's non-zeros. Examples 2 and 3 use this mode. The code, as written and executed previously, applies the following logic for Mode B: Start with an all-zero row, apply the non-zero values from the reference row, then overlay the non-zero values from the current input row.
    - **Example 2 Analysis:** This logic fails significantly. The expected output often requires rows that were all-zero in the input to remain all-zero in the output, whereas the implemented logic populates them with the reference pattern. Furthermore, even for non-zero input rows, the overlay logic doesn't consistently produce the expected pattern (e.g., mismatches at column 15). The total pixel difference calculated using this logic is 20.
    - **Example 3 Analysis:** This logic works for some rows (row 0, row 6) but fails for others. It incorrectly populates all-zero input rows (rows 1, 2) with the full reference pattern instead of the expected partial patterns. For non-zero input rows, it also produces mismatches by including reference row elements that should be zero in the output. The total pixel difference calculated using this logic is 7.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Retain Mode A:** The logic for `transform_independent_row` appears correct based on Example 1.
2.  **Revise Mode B:** The current Mode B logic ("Start 0s, Apply Ref NZ, Overlay Input NZ") is flawed, particularly in handling all-zero input rows differently across examples and correctly determining which reference elements to keep.
3.  **New Mode B Hypothesis:** A more accurate Mode B rule, considering the failures, might be:
    *   If the current input row is all zeros, the output row is all zeros. (Addresses failures in Ex 2).
    *   If the current input row has non-zeros:
        *   Start the output row with the non-zero pattern of the reference row.
        *   For each non-zero cell `(c, v)` in the input row, update the output row at column `c` to value `v`.
    *   *Self-Correction:* This still doesn't explain Example 3, where all-zero input rows can produce non-zero outputs. The task likely has a more complex rule for Mode B or potentially more than two modes. However, given the need to provide a single program, the best approach is to implement the logic that minimizes errors across the examples. The rule described above (all-zero input -> all-zero output, else Ref base + Input overlay) addresses the largest error source (Ex 2 all-zero rows). We will proceed with this revised Mode B logic.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Reflect the corrected Mode B logic in the YAML facts and natural language program.

    output: mode ('independent_row' or 'reference_overlay')
    logic: If last_non_zero_row_data is None or has no non-zero cells, mode defaults to 'reference_overlay'. Otherwise, check if any non-zero cells in last_non_zero_row_data have consecutive column indices. If yes, mode is 'independent_row' (Mode A). If no, mode is 'reference_overlay' (Mode B).

      - If len(non_zero_cells) < 2, return a copy of the input row.
      - Initialize output_row as a copy of input_row.
      - If step == 1:

      - If yes, return a list of zeros of length `width`.
      - If no:
        - Initialize output_row as a copy of reference_row_data.

        - For each (c, v) in non_zero_cells_input: set output_row[c] = v (overwriting the reference value).
        - Return output_row.
relationships:
  - The overall transformation strategy (Mode A or Mode B) depends entirely on whether the last non-zero row of the input grid contains adjacent non-zero elements.
  - Mode A transforms each row based only on its own internal non-zero patterns.
  - Mode B (Revised) transforms each row based on the reference row, but with specific handling: all-zero input rows produce all-zero output rows; non-zero input rows start with the reference pattern and then overwrite values based on the input row's non-zeros.
```

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialization:** Examine the input grid. Find the index and data of the last row containing any non-zero elements. Let this be `reference_row_data`. If no such row exists, return a copy of the input grid. Determine the width of the grid.
2.  **Mode Determination:** Analyze `reference_row_data`. Check if it contains any two non-zero elements located at adjacent column indices (e.g., column `c` and column `c+1`).
    *   If **yes** (adjacent non-zeros found), select **Mode A (Independent Row Transformation)**.
    *   If **no** (or if `reference_row_data` has fewer than 2 non-zero elements), select **Mode B (Reference Overlay Transformation - Revised)**.
3.  **Execute Transformation (Row by Row):**
    *   **Mode A (Independent Row Transformation):**
        a.  Create an empty output grid.
        b.  For each `input_row` in the input grid:
            i.  Find all non-zero cells `(column, value)` in the `input_row`, sorted by column (`nz`).
            ii. If `len(nz) < 2`, append a copy of the `input_row` to the output grid and continue to the next row.
            iii. Determine `c_min` (first non-zero column), `c_max` (last non-zero column), `V` (last non-zero value), `step` (column difference between first two non-zeros), and `all_same_value` (boolean).
            iv. Initialize `output_row` as a copy of `input_row`.
            v.  Apply filling logic based on `step`:
                *   If `step == 1`:
                    *   If `all_same_value` is True: Fill `output_row` from column `c_min` to the end of the row (width-1) with value `V`.
                    *   If `all_same_value` is False: Fill `output_row` from column `c_min` to `c_max` (inclusive) with value `V`.
                *   If `step > 1`:
                    *   Initialize `c = c_min`.
                    *   If `all_same_value` is True: While `c` is less than the row width, set `output_row[c] = V` and increment `c` by `step`.
                    *   If `all_same_value` is False: While `c` is less than or equal to `c_max`, set `output_row[c] = V` and increment `c` by `step`.
            vi. Append the modified `output_row` to the output grid.
        c.  Return the completed output grid.
    *   **Mode B (Reference Overlay Transformation - Revised):**
        a.  Create an empty output grid.
        b.  For each `input_row` in the input grid:
            i.  Check if the `input_row` consists entirely of zeros.
            ii. If yes, append a new row containing only zeros (of the correct width) to the output grid.
            iii. If no (the `input_row` contains non-zero values):
                *   Initialize the `output_row` as a direct copy of the `reference_row_data`.
                *   Find all non-zero cells `(column, value)` in the current `input_row` (`nz_input`).
                *   For each `(c, v)` in `nz_input`: Set `output_row[c] = v` (overwriting the value inherited from the reference row).
                *   Append the finalized `output_row` to the output grid.
        c.  Return the completed output grid.
