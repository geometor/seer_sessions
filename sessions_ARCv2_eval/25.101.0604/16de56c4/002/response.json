            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous attempt correctly identified the existence of two distinct transformation modes but incorrectly determined the trigger condition and the exact logic for the second mode (Reference Row Overlay). The first mode (Independent Row Transformation) was mostly correct but had a boundary condition error in the \"step > 1\" case.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Correct the Trigger Condition:** The determining factor is whether the *last non-zero row* in the input grid contains *adjacent* non-zero elements (at column `c` and `c+1`). This will select between the two transformation modes.\n2.  **Refine Mode 1 (Independent Row Transformation):** Adjust the logic for rows where the step between the first two non-zero elements is greater than 1. The fill should stop at the column of the last non-zero element (`c_max`), not necessarily the end of the row.\n3.  **Correct Mode 2 (Reference Row Overlay):** Implement the logic where *every* output row starts as a copy of the last non-zero input row (the reference row), and then the non-zero values from the *corresponding input row* are overlaid onto it. Crucially, input rows containing only zeros should result in an output row that is a direct copy of the reference row.\n4.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect this corrected understanding.\n\n## Metrics from Previous Attempt\n\n```tool_code\n# Example 1 Data\nin1 = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[9,0,9,0,0,0,6,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[8,8,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]]\nexp1 = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0]]\nout1 = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0]]\n\n# Example 2 Data\nin2 = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],[0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0]]\nexp2 = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0],[0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0]]\nout2 = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0],[0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,5,0],[0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0],[0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0],[0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0],[0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0],[0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0]]\n\n# Example 3 Data\nin3 = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0],[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0],[0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,2,0]]\nexp3 = [[0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,2,0],[0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0],[0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,2,0],[0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0],[0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,2,0]]\nout3 = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,2,0],[0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,2,0],[0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,2,0],[0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,2,0]]\n\ndef count_diff(grid1, grid2):\n    diff = 0\n    if not grid1 or not grid2 or len(grid1) != len(grid2) or len(grid1[0]) != len(grid2[0]):\n        return -1 # Indicates size mismatch or empty grid\n    rows = len(grid1)\n    cols = len(grid1[0])\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid1[r][c] != grid2[r][c]:\n                diff += 1\n    return diff\n\nprint(\"--- Metrics for Failed Code ---\")\nprint(f\"Ex 1 Pixels Off: {count_diff(exp1, out1)}\")\nprint(f\"Ex 2 Pixels Off: {count_diff(exp2, out2)}\")\nprint(f\"Ex 3 Pixels Off: {count_diff(exp3, out3)}\")\n\n```\n\n```text\n--- Metrics for Failed Code ---\nEx 1 Pixels Off: 1\nEx 2 Pixels Off: 17\nEx 3 Pixels Off: 13\n```\n\n## Facts\n\n```yaml\ntask_description: Transforms a 2D grid based on patterns in its rows, potentially governed by the structure of the last non-zero row.\ngrid_properties:\n  dimensionality: 2D\n  cell_values: integers (0-9)\n  background_color: 0\nobjects:\n  -

Let this be the `reference_row` at `reference_row_index`. If no non-zero elements exist anywhere in the grid, return a copy of the input grid.\n2.  **Mode Determination:** Analyze the `reference_row`.

Create an empty output grid.\n        b.  Iterate through each `input_row` of the input grid.\n        c.  Find all non-zero cells `(column, value)` in the `input_row`, sorted by column. Let this list be `nz`.\n        d.  If `len(nz) < 2`, append a copy of the `input_row` to the output grid.\n        e.  If `len(nz) >= 2`:\n            i.  Determine the first non-zero column `c_min = nz[0][0]`.\n            ii. Determine the last non-zero column `c_max = nz[-1][0]`.\n            iii. Determine the value of the last non-zero cell `V = nz[-1][1]`.\n            iv. Calculate the difference between the column indices of the first two non-zero cells: `step = nz[1][0] - nz[0][0]`.\n            v.

Iterate through each `input_row` of the input grid (from top to bottom).\n        c.  Initialize the `output_row` as a direct copy of the `reference_row`.\n        d.  Find all non-zero cells `(column, value)` in the current `input_row`.\n        e.  For each found non-zero cell `(column, value)`, update the `output_row` at the `column` index with the `value`.\n        f.  Append the finalized `output_row` to the output grid.\n        g.  Return the completed output grid."
