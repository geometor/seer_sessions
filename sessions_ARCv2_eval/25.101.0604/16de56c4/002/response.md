## General Assessment

The previous attempt correctly identified the existence of two distinct transformation modes but incorrectly determined the trigger condition and the exact logic for the second mode (Reference Row Overlay). The first mode (Independent Row Transformation) was mostly correct but had a boundary condition error in the "step > 1" case.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Correct the Trigger Condition:** The determining factor is whether the *last non-zero row* in the input grid contains *adjacent* non-zero elements (at column `c` and `c+1`). This will select between the two transformation modes.
2.  **Refine Mode 1 (Independent Row Transformation):** Adjust the logic for rows where the step between the first two non-zero elements is greater than 1. The fill should stop at the column of the last non-zero element (`c_max`), not necessarily the end of the row.
3.  **Correct Mode 2 (Reference Row Overlay):** Implement the logic where *every* output row starts as a copy of the last non-zero input row (the reference row), and then the non-zero values from the *corresponding input row* are overlaid onto it. Crucially, input rows containing only zeros should result in an output row that is a direct copy of the reference row.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect this corrected understanding.

      - If len(non_zero_cells) < 2, return a copy of the input row.
      - Initialize output_row as a copy of input_row.

        - Initialize output_row as a copy of reference_row.
        - Get non_zero_cells for the current input_row.
        - For each (c, v) in non_zero_cells: set output_row[c] = v.
        - Append output_row to output_grid.
      - Return output_grid.
relationships:
  - The overall transformation strategy depends on the adjacency of non-zero elements in the last non-zero row of the input grid.
  - If adjacent non-zeros exist in the last non-zero row, each row is transformed independently based on its own non-zero elements.
  - If no adjacent non-zeros exist in the last non-zero row, the entire grid is transformed row-by-row, using the last non-zero row as a template and overlaying non-zeros from the corresponding input row.
```

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialization:** Examine the input grid to find the last row containing any non-zero elements. Let this be the `reference_row` at `reference_row_index`. If no non-zero elements exist anywhere in the grid, return a copy of the input grid.
2.  **Mode Determination:** Analyze the `reference_row`. Check if there are any two non-zero elements located at adjacent column indices (e.g., column `c` and column `c+1`).
3.  **Execute Transformation based on Mode:**
    *   **Mode A: Adjacent Non-Zeros Found in `reference_row` (Independent Row Transformation):**
        a.  Create an empty output grid.
        b.  Iterate through each `input_row` of the input grid.
        c.  Find all non-zero cells `(column, value)` in the `input_row`, sorted by column. Let this list be `nz`.
        d.  If `len(nz) < 2`, append a copy of the `input_row` to the output grid.
        e.  If `len(nz) >= 2`:
            i.  Determine the first non-zero column `c_min = nz[0][0]`.
            ii. Determine the last non-zero column `c_max = nz[-1][0]`.
            iii. Determine the value of the last non-zero cell `V = nz[-1][1]`.
            iv. Calculate the difference between the column indices of the first two non-zero cells: `step = nz[1][0] - nz[0][0]`.
            v.  Check if all values in `nz` are the same (`all_same_value`).
            vi. Initialize `output_row` as a copy of `input_row`.
            vii. Apply filling logic:
                *   If `all_same_value` is True AND `step == 1`: Fill `output_row` from column `c_min` to the end of the row with value `V`.
                *   Else if `step == 1`: Fill `output_row` from column `c_min` to `c_max` (inclusive) with value `V`.
                *   Else (`step > 1`): Starting at column `c = c_min`, set `output_row[c] = V` and increment `c` by `step`, repeating as long as `c <= c_max`.
            viii. Append the modified `output_row` to the output grid.
        f.  Return the completed output grid.
    *   **Mode B: No Adjacent Non-Zeros Found in `reference_row` (Reference Row Overlay):**
        a.  Create an empty output grid.
        b.  Iterate through each `input_row` of the input grid (from top to bottom).
        c.  Initialize the `output_row` as a direct copy of the `reference_row`.
        d.  Find all non-zero cells `(column, value)` in the current `input_row`.
        e.  For each found non-zero cell `(column, value)`, update the `output_row` at the `column` index with the `value`.
        f.  Append the finalized `output_row` to the output grid.
        g.  Return the completed output grid.
