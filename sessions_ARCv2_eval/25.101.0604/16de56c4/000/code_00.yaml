task_description: Transform each row of a grid based on its non-zero elements.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  cell_values: integers (0-9)
  background_color: 0
objects:
  - name: row
    properties:
      - contains_non_zero_elements: boolean
      - non_zero_cells: list of (column_index, value) tuples
      - leftmost_non_zero_column: integer (c_min)
      - rightmost_non_zero_column: integer (c_max)
      - rightmost_non_zero_value: integer (V)
      - distinct_non_zero_values: set of integers
actions:
  - name: process_row
    input: input_row_data
    output: output_row_data
    logic:
      - If the row contains no non-zero elements, the output row is identical to the input row (all zeros).
      - Otherwise, identify the column indices of the leftmost (c_min) and rightmost (c_max) non-zero elements.
      - Identify the value of the rightmost non-zero element (V).
      - Determine the set of distinct non-zero values in the row.
      - **Hypothesized Rule (needs refinement):**
        - Initialize the output row as a copy of the input row.
        - Fill the cells in the output row from column `c_min` to `c_max` (inclusive) with the value `V`.
        - (Note: This rule does not perfectly explain all examples, especially train_1 row 4 and row 8, suggesting conditional logic or alternative rules might apply based on factors like color uniformity or specific spacing patterns).
relationships:
  - The transformation of a cell depends only on the data within its row in the input grid.
  - The output value of cells within the horizontal span [c_min, c_max] is primarily determined by the value V from the rightmost non-zero cell at c_max.
