The transformation seems primarily horizontal, affecting cells within a row based on the positions and values of the non-zero elements in that row in the input grid.\n\nKey observations across examples:\n\n1.  **Row Independence:** The transformation appears to be applied independently to each row. The output of a row depends only on the input of that same row.\n2.  **Non-Zero Elements Define Action:** The transformation is triggered and defined by the non-zero elements within a row. Rows containing only zeros remain unchanged.\n3.  **Horizontal Span:** The transformation affects a horizontal segment of the row. This segment seems bounded by the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements in the input row.\n4.  **Dominant Color:** The color (value) used for filling the affected segment seems determined by the value of the *rightmost* non-zero element in the input row.\n5.  **Filling Mechanism:**\n    *   In some cases (e.g., `train_1`, row 11: `8 8 ... 3 0` -> `3 3 ... 3 0`), all cells between the leftmost and rightmost non-zero input cells (inclusive) are filled with the dominant color.\n    *   In other cases (e.g., `train_1`, row 4: `1 1 0...` -> `1 1 1...`), the fill seems to extend beyond the rightmost non-zero cell, potentially to the end of the grid. This might occur when all non-zero elements in the input row share the same value.\n    *   In yet other cases (e.g., `train_1`, row 8: `9 0 9 ... 6 0 0` -> `6 0 6 0 6 0 6 0 0`), the filling within the span is selective, not painting over all original zeros. This selective filling is the hardest part to generalize.\n\nGiven the variations, the most consistent core operation appears to be filling the horizontal span defined by the outermost non-zero elements with the color of the rightmost element. However, there are modifications or alternative rules based on the homogeneity of colors or specific patterns within the row.\n\n## Facts\n\n```yaml\ntask_description: Transform each row of a grid based on its non-zero elements.\ngrid_properties:\n  dimensionality: 2D\n  cell_values: integers (0-9)\n  background_color: 0\nobjects:\n  - name: row\n    properties:\n      - contains_non_zero_elements: boolean\n      - non_zero_cells: list of (column_index, value) tuples\n      - leftmost_non_zero_column: integer (c_min)\n      - rightmost_non_zero_column: integer (c_max)\n      - rightmost_non_zero_value: integer (V)\n      - distinct_non_zero_values: set of integers\nactions:\n  - name: process_row\n    input: input_row_data\n    output: output_row_data\n    logic:\n      - If the row contains no non-zero elements, the output row is identical to the input row (all zeros).\n      - Otherwise, identify the column indices of the leftmost (c_min) and rightmost (c_max) non-zero elements.\n      - Identify the value of the rightmost non-zero element (V).\n      - Determine the set of distinct non-zero values in the row.\n      - **Hypothesized Rule (needs refinement):**\n        - Initialize the output row as a copy of the input row.\n        - Fill the cells in the output row from column `c_min` to `c_max` (inclusive) with the value `V`.\n        - (Note: This rule does not perfectly explain all examples, especially train_1 row 4 and row 8, suggesting conditional logic or alternative rules might apply based on factors like color uniformity or specific spacing patterns).\nrelationships:\n  - The transformation of a cell depends only on the data within its row in the input grid.\n  - The output value of cells within the horizontal span [c_min, c_max] is primarily determined by the value V from the rightmost non-zero cell at c_max.\n```\n\n## Natural Language Program\n\n1.  Iterate through each row of the input grid independently.\n2.  For the current row:\n    a.  Find all non-zero cells and their column indices.\n    b.  If there are no non-zero cells, copy the input row (all zeros) to the output row and proceed to the next row.\n    c.  If there are non-zero cells:\n        i.  Determine the column index of the leftmost non-zero cell (`c_min`).\n        ii. Determine the column index of the rightmost non-zero cell (`c_max`).\n        iii. Determine the value of the rightmost non-zero cell (`V`).\n        iv. Create the output row by copying the input row.\n        v.  Fill the segment of the output row from column `c_min` to `c_max` (inclusive) with the value `V`.\n        vi. (Self-correction/Refinement Needed: The simple span fill described in step `v` does not perfectly match all examples. Cases like `train_1` row 4, row 8, and row 1 suggest additional conditions: perhaps if all non-zero values are the same, the fill extends to the grid edge, or perhaps the fill within the span `[c_min, c_max]` sometimes preserves original zeros based on specific criteria not yet fully understood).\n3.  Combine the processed output rows to form the final output grid."
