            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code attempt (based on Hypothesis 13) performed significantly worse than the first attempt (based on Hypothesis 15), indicating that the logic involving the OR condition (`val_sym == val_axis or val_sym == 8`) and the exception (`val_orig == val_axis and val_sym == val_axis`) was flawed. The high number of incorrect pixels suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of the transformation rule.\n\nThe first attempt (Hypothesis 15: `output[r][c] = val_axis` if `input[r_sym][c] == val_axis`) yielded results much closer to the target outputs, despite still having errors. This suggests the core idea of checking the symmetric input cell against the axis value is relevant, but needs refinement.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Analyze the specific failures of Hypothesis 15 (the first code attempt) by comparing its output to the expected output for each example.\n2.  Identify patterns distinguishing cases where H15 succeeded from where it failed. Focus on the relationship between `input[r][c]` (original value), `input[r_sym][c]` (symmetric value), and `input[R][c]` (axis value).\n3.  Consider spatial relationships, such as adjacency to the axis row.\n4.  Develop a new hypothesis (Hypothesis 31) incorporating these observations, particularly addressing the different behaviors noted for cells adjacent to the axis versus non-adjacent cells, and the seemingly special case where both original and symmetric cells are background.\n5.  Formulate the natural language program based on the refined hypothesis.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics are based on comparing the **Expected Output** with the output generated by the *first* code attempt (Hypothesis 15: `output[r][c] = val_axis` if `input[r_sym][c] == val_axis`), as reported in the previous turn's results. This code was closer to the solution.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 13x13 = 169 cells\n    *   Axis Row (R): 6\n    *   Pixels Off (H15 vs Expected): 16\n    *   Failure Types:\n        *   False Negative (Output 8, Expected val_axis): 8 pixels (e.g., O[2][8]=1/8, O[3][7]=7/8, O[3][8]=1/8, O[4][8]=1/8, O[8][8]=1/8, O[9][7]=7/8, O[9][8]=1/8, O[10][8]=1/8). These occur when `val_sym != val_axis`, but output should be `val_axis`. Notably, these cases have `val_orig=8` and `val_sym=8`.\n        *   False Positive (Output val_axis, Expected 8): 8 pixels (e.g., O[2][1]=8/5, O[3][1]=8/5, O[3][6]=8/2, O[4][1]=8/5, O[8][1]=8/5, O[9][1]=8/5, O[9][6]=8/2, O[10][1]=8/5). These occur when `val_sym == val_axis`, but output should be 8. These cases have `val_orig != 8`.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 15x15 = 225 cells\n    *   Axis Row (R): 7\n    *   Pixels Off (H15 vs Expected): 12\n    *   Failure Types:\n        *   False Negative (Output 8, Expected val_axis): 6 pixels (e.g., O[3][8]=1/8, O[4][8]=1/8, O[10][8]=1/8, O[11][8]=1/8, O[12][8]=1/8, O[5][2]=8/4?). Occur when `val_sym != val_axis`. Most have `val_orig=8, val_sym=8`.\n        *   False Positive (Output val_axis, Expected 8): 6 pixels (e.g., O[3][12]=8/9, O[4][4]=8/7, O[4][12]=8/9, O[5][4]=8/7, O[5][12]=8/9, O[6][2]=8/4?). Occur when `val_sym == val_axis` and `val_orig != 8`.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Size: 7x7 = 49 cells\n    *   Axis Row (R): 3\n    *   Pixels Off (H15 vs Expected): 4\n    *   Failure Types:\n        *   False Negative (Output 8, Expected val_axis): 2 pixels (O[1][6]=7/8, O[5][6]=7/8). Occur when `val_sym != val_axis`. Here `val_orig=8, val_sym=8`.\n        *   False Positive (Output val_axis, Expected 8): 2 pixels (O[1][2]=8/1, O[5][2]=8/1). Occur when `val_sym == val_axis` and `val_orig != 8`.\n\n**Summary of Failure Analysis:**\nThe core rule `output = val_axis if val_sym == val_axis` needs modification:\n1.  It wrongly sets output to 8 when `val_sym != val_axis` but `val_orig == 8` and `val_sym == 8`. In these cases, the output should be `val_axis`.\n2.  It wrongly sets output to `val_axis` when `val_sym == val_axis` but `val_orig != 8`. Closer analysis suggests this specific condition (`val_sym == val_axis` and `val_orig != 8`) should result in 8 *unless* the row `r` is immediately adjacent to the axis row `R`.\n\n## Facts\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: input_grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array of integers (digits 0-9)\n      - background_color: 8\n      - contains_axis_row: true\n  - name: output_grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array of integers (digits 0-9)\n      - dimensions: same as input_grid\n      - background_color: 8\n  - name: axis_row\n    properties:\n      - type: row vector within the input_grid\n      - identifier: contains the digit 6\n      - index: R\n  - name: cell\n    properties:\n      - row_index: r\n      - column_index: c\n      - value: integer (digit 0-9)\n      - location: (r, c) in a grid\nrelationships:\n  - type: symmetry\n    between: cell (r, c) and cell (r_sym, c)\n    where: r_sym = R + (R - r)\n  - type: adjacency\n    between: row r and axis_row R\n    where: abs(r - R) == 1\nactions:\n  - name: find_axis_row\n    input: input_grid\n    output: axis_row_index R\n  - name: initialize_output\n    produces: output_grid (filled with background color 8)\n  - name: copy_axis_row\n    source: input_grid[R]\n    destination: output_grid[R]\n  - name: calculate_output_cell_value\n    inputs:\n      - current cell coordinates: (r, c)\n      - axis_row_index: R\n      - input_grid\n    preconditions:\n      - r != R\n    process:\n      - get axis value: val_axis = input_grid[R][c]\n      - if val_axis == 6, output is 8\n      - calculate symmetric row: r_sym = R + (R - r)\n      - if r_sym is out of bounds, output is 8\n      - get symmetric value: val_sym = input_grid[r_sym][c]\n      - get original value: val_orig = input_grid[r][c]\n      # --- Hypothesis 31 Logic ---\n      - if val_sym == val_axis:\n          - if abs(r - R) == 1: output = val_axis # Adjacent rows copy if symmetric matches\n          - elif val_orig == 8: output = val_axis # Non-adjacent copy only if original is background\n          - else: output = 8\n      - else: # val_sym != val_axis\n          - if val_orig == 8 and val_sym == 8: output = val_axis # Both background rule\n          - else: output = 8\n    output: value for output_grid[r][c]\n```\n\n## Natural Language Program\n\n1.  Identify the horizontal row in the `input_grid` that contains the digit '6'. Let the index of this row be `R`. This is the 'axis row'.\n2.  Create a new `output_grid` with the same dimensions as the `input_grid`, initially filled entirely with the background color '8'.\n3.  Copy the entire axis row `R` from the `input_grid` to the `output_grid` at row `R`.\n4.  Iterate through each row `r` of the `input_grid`, excluding the axis row `R`.\n5.  For each row `r`, iterate through each column `c` from 0 to the grid width minus 1.\n6.  Get the value from the axis row at this column: `val_axis = input_grid[R][c]`.\n7.  If `val_axis` is equal to '6', the corresponding cell `output_grid[r][c]` remains background '8'. Skip to the next column.\n8.  Calculate the index of the symmetrically opposite row: `r_sym = R + (R - r)`.\n9.  Check if `r_sym` is a valid row index (within the grid boundaries: `0 <= r_sym < height`). If `r_sym` is invalid, the cell `output_grid[r][c]` remains background '8'. Skip to the next column.\n10. Get the value from the input grid at the symmetric position: `val_sym = input_grid[r_sym][c]`.\n11. Get the value from the input grid at the current cell's original position: `val_orig = input_grid[r][c]`.\n12. **Determine the output value based on the following conditions:**\n    *   **Case 1: Symmetric value matches axis value (`val_sym == val_axis`)**\n        *   If the current row `r` is immediately adjacent to the axis row `R` (i.e., `abs(r - R) == 1`), then set `output_grid[r][c] = val_axis`.\n        *   Else (if `r` is not adjacent to `R`):\n            *   If the original value `val_orig` is the background color ('8'), then set `output_grid[r][c] = val_axis`.\n            *   Otherwise (if `val_orig` is not '8'), set `output_grid[r][c] = 8`.\n    *   **Case 2: Symmetric value does NOT match axis value (`val_sym != val_axis`)**\n        *   If both the original value `val_orig` AND the symmetric value `val_sym` are the background color ('8'), then set `output_grid[r][c] = val_axis`.\n        *   Otherwise, set `output_grid[r][c] = 8`.\n13. After iterating through all applicable rows `r` and columns `c`, the `output_grid` is complete."
