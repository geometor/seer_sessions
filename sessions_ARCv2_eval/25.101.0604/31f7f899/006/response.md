## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous attempt (Hypothesis 31) introduced complex rules involving adjacency and background checks that resulted in outputs significantly diverging from the target, performing worse than the initial, simpler hypothesis (H15: `output = val_axis if val_sym == val_axis`).

The analysis suggests revisiting the core conditions under which a cell `output[r][c]` should take the value `val_axis = input[R][c]`. By carefully comparing the input cells (`input[r][c]`, `input[r_sym][c]`) with the axis value (`input[R][c]`) in cases where the output matches `val_axis` versus where it remains background '8', a more refined set of conditions can be derived.

The key insight appears to be distinguishing the behavior when both the original and symmetric input cells match the axis value, based on whether the current row `r` is immediately adjacent to the axis row `R`.

**Strategy:**
1.  Analyze the conditions (`val_orig`, `val_sym`, `val_axis`) for cells where `output[r][c] == val_axis` across all examples.
2.  Group these conditions into logical rules.
3.  Pay special attention to the case where `val_orig == val_axis` and `val_sym == val_axis`, noting how the output differs based on adjacency (`abs(r - R) == 1`).
4.  Formulate a comprehensive rule (Hypothesis 32) covering all observed cases where the output cell takes the axis value.
5.  Define the "otherwise" case where the output cell remains background '8'.
6.  Translate this rule into a clear natural language program.

## Metrics

Metrics are derived by comparing the expected output with the input and identifying patterns based on the cell values (`val_orig`, `val_sym`, `val_axis`) and cell location relative to the axis (`r`, `R`).

*   **Cells where `output == val_axis`:**
    *   Case 1: `val_orig == 8` and `val_sym == 8` (e.g., Ex1: (2,8), (3,7), (3,8), (4,8), (8,8), (9,7), (9,8), (10,8); Ex2: (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (9,8), (10,8), (11,8), (12,8); Ex3: (1,6), (5,6))
    *   Case 2: `val_orig == 8` and `val_sym == val_axis` (e.g., Ex1: (5,6); Ex2: (5,2)?) - Let's re-check Ex2 (5,2): I(5,2)=4, I(9,2)=4, axis=4. Expected O(5,2)=8. This case doesn't seem to exist cleanly. Check Ex1(5,6): I(5,6)=8, I(7,6)=2, axis=2. Expected O(5,6)=2. Yes, this case exists.
    *   Case 3: `val_orig == val_axis` and `val_sym == 8` (e.g., Ex1: (7,6); Ex2: (9,2)?) - Re-check Ex2 (9,2): I(9,2)=4, I(5,2)=4, axis=4. Expected O(9,2)=8. This case doesn't seem to exist cleanly. Check Ex1(7,6): I(7,6)=2, I(5,6)=8, axis=2. Expected O(7,6)=2. Yes, this case exists.
    *   Case 4: `val_orig == val_axis` and `val_sym == val_axis` AND `abs(r-R)==1` (Adjacent) (e.g., Ex1: (5,1), (5,7), (5,8), (7,1), (7,7), (7,8); Ex2: (6,2), (6,4), (6,6), (6,8), (6,12), (8,2), (8,4), (8,6), (8,8), (8,12); Ex3: (2,0), (2,2), (2,4), (2,6), (4,0), (4,2), (4,4), (4,6))
*   **Cells where `output == 8` (and `val_axis != 6`, `r_sym` in bounds):**
    *   Default case (none of the above match).
    *   Specifically includes: `val_orig == val_axis` and `val_sym == val_axis` AND `abs(r-R) != 1` (Not Adjacent) (e.g., Ex1: (4,1), (2,1); Ex2: (5,2), (3,12), (9,2), (11,12))

This analysis supports Hypothesis 32.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the horizontal row in the `input_grid` that contains the digit '6'. Let the index of this row be `R`. This is the 'axis row'.
2.  Create a new `output_grid` with the same dimensions as the `input_grid`, initially filled entirely with the background color '8'.
3.  Copy the entire axis row `R` from the `input_grid` to the `output_grid` at row `R`.
4.  Iterate through each row `r` of the `input_grid`, excluding the axis row `R`.
5.  For each row `r`, iterate through each column `c` from 0 to the grid width minus 1.
6.  Get the value from the axis row at this column: `val_axis = input_grid[R][c]`.
7.  If `val_axis` is equal to '6', the corresponding cell `output_grid[r][c]` remains background '8'. Skip to the next column.
8.  Calculate the index of the symmetrically opposite row: `r_sym = R + (R - r)`.
9.  Check if `r_sym` is a valid row index (within the grid boundaries: `0 <= r_sym < height`). If `r_sym` is invalid, the cell `output_grid[r][c]` remains background '8'. Skip to the next column.
10. Get the value from the input grid at the current cell's original position: `val_orig = input_grid[r][c]`.
11. Get the value from the input grid at the symmetric position: `val_sym = input_grid[r_sym][c]`.
12. **Determine if the output cell `output_grid[r][c]` should be set to `val_axis` based on the following conditions. Check if ANY of these conditions are true:**
    *   Condition 1: The original value is background AND the symmetric value is background (`val_orig == 8` and `val_sym == 8`).
    *   Condition 2: The original value is background AND the symmetric value matches the axis value (`val_orig == 8` and `val_sym == val_axis`).
    *   Condition 3: The original value matches the axis value AND the symmetric value is background (`val_orig == val_axis` and `val_sym == 8`).
    *   Condition 4: The original value matches the axis value AND the symmetric value matches the axis value AND the current row `r` is immediately adjacent to the axis row `R` (`val_orig == val_axis` and `val_sym == val_axis` and `abs(r - R) == 1`).
13. If **any** of the conditions in Step 12 are true, set `output_grid[r][c] = val_axis`.
14. Otherwise (if **none** of the conditions in Step 12 are true), the cell `output_grid[r][c]` remains background '8'.
15. After iterating through all applicable rows `r` and columns `c`, the `output_grid` is complete.
