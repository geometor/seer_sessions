Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code implemented the hypothesis: `output[r][c] = val_axis` if `input[r_sym][c] == val_axis`. The results clearly show this hypothesis is incorrect, as the generated output often resembles the input grid rather than the expected reflected/transformed output.

The core idea of finding an axis row (containing '6') and performing a symmetric operation seems sound, as the axis row itself is consistently copied correctly, and the modifications in the output are symmetric around this axis.

The key is to correctly identify the condition under which a cell `(r, c)` (where `r` is not the axis row index `R`) takes the value `val_axis = input[R][c]`. The failures indicate that simply checking if the symmetrically opposite input cell `input[r_sym][c]` matches `val_axis` is insufficient.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Analyze Failures:** Examine the specific cells where the previous code's output differs from the expected output.
2.  **Compare Input and Output:** Look for patterns comparing `input[r][c]`, `input[r_sym][c]`, and `input[R][c]` for cells where `output[r][c]` equals `input[R][c]` versus where it equals the background '8'.
3.  **Formulate New Hypothesis:** Develop a revised rule based on the analysis. Initial thoughts revolved around propagation or different masking conditions, but a closer look suggests a modified symmetric condition might work.
4.  **Test New Hypothesis:** Mentally walk through the examples with the new hypothesis before proposing the final natural language program.

**Analysis leading to Hypothesis 13:**
*   Comparing Hypothesis 5 (symmetric match: `input[r_sym][c] == val_axis`) with expected outputs showed it failed when the symmetric cell did *not* match the axis value, yet the output *did* take the axis value (e.g., Ex1 `output[2][8]=1` when `input[10][8]=8` and `val_axis=1`). This suggests the rule needs to be broader.
*   Comparing Hypothesis 12 (symmetric match OR symmetric is background: `input[r_sym][c] == val_axis` OR `input[r_sym][c] == 8`) worked for many previously failed cases but introduced new failures where both the original cell *and* the symmetric cell matched the axis value (e.g., Ex1 `output[4][1]=8` when H12 predicted 5 because `input[4][1]=5`, `val_axis=5`, and `input[8][1]=5`).
*   This led to Hypothesis 13, which uses the broader condition from H12 but adds an explicit exception: if both the original cell and its symmetric counterpart already match the axis color, the output should revert to the background color '8'.

## Metrics

Let's analyze the previous code's failures based on the provided results:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Size: 13x13
    *   Axis Row (R): 6
    *   Pixels Off: 16
    *   Expected non-8, non-6 values outside axis: 24 (count of 5, 2, 7, 1 instances)
    *   Code's non-8, non-6 values outside axis: 16 (count of 5, 2, 7, 1 instances in its output)
    *   Analysis: The code missed placing the axis value in 8 locations above the axis and 8 locations below the axis, specifically where the symmetric cell did not match the axis value (e.g., `output[2][8]` should be 1 but `input[10][8]` is 8). It also incorrectly placed the axis value in 8 locations (4 above, 4 below) where the symmetric cell *did* match the axis value, but the original cell *also* matched (e.g., `output[4][1]` should be 8, but code put 5 because `input[8][1]=5`). Total difference involves these 16 cells.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Size: 15x15
    *   Axis Row (R): 7
    *   Pixels Off: 12
    *   Analysis: Similar pattern of failure. Code likely missed cases where `input[r_sym][c]` was 8 (like `output[3][8]=1` where `input[11][8]=8`) and incorrectly included cases where `input[r][c] == input[r_sym][c] == val_axis` (like `output[5][4]=8` where code put 7 because `input[9][4]=7`).
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Size: 7x7
    *   Axis Row (R): 3
    *   Pixels Off: 4
    *   Analysis: Code failed to place '7' at `output[1][6]` and `output[5][6]` because the symmetric cells (`input[5][6]` and `input[1][6]`) were 8, not 7. It correctly placed '4', '1', '1', '7' in rows 2 and 4 because the symmetric cells matched.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the horizontal row in the `input_grid` that contains the digit '6'. Let the index of this row be `R`. This is the 'axis row'.
2.  Create a new `output_grid` with the same dimensions as the `input_grid`, initially filled entirely with the background color '8'.
3.  Copy the entire axis row `R` from the `input_grid` to the `output_grid` at row `R`.
4.  Iterate through each row `r` of the `input_grid`, excluding the axis row `R`.
5.  For each row `r`, iterate through each column `c` from 0 to the grid width minus 1.
6.  Get the value from the axis row at this column: `val_axis = input_grid[R][c]`.
7.  If `val_axis` is equal to '6', the corresponding cell `output_grid[r][c]` remains background '8'. Skip to the next column.
8.  Calculate the index of the symmetrically opposite row: `r_sym = R + (R - r)`.
9.  Check if `r_sym` is a valid row index (within the grid boundaries). If `r_sym` is invalid, the cell `output_grid[r][c]` remains background '8'. Skip to the next column.
10. Get the value from the input grid at the symmetric position: `val_sym = input_grid[r_sym][c]`.
11. Get the value from the input grid at the current cell's original position: `val_orig = input_grid[r][c]`.
12. Check if the reflection rule applies: Does the symmetric value match the axis value (`val_sym == val_axis`) OR is the symmetric value the background color (`val_sym == 8`)?
13. Check for the exception case: Does the original value match the axis value (`val_orig == val_axis`) AND does the symmetric value also match the axis value (`val_sym == val_axis`)?
14. If the reflection rule applies (Step 12 is true) AND the exception case does NOT apply (Step 13 is false), then set the output cell to the axis value: `output_grid[r][c] = val_axis`.
15. Otherwise (if the rule does not apply OR if the exception case applies), the cell `output_grid[r][c]` remains background '8'.
16. After iterating through all rows `r` (except `R`) and all columns `c`, the `output_grid` is complete.
