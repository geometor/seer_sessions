task_description: Modify or remove specific 3x3 patterns within a grid based on the colors of the frame and center.

definitions:
  - object: Framed Object
    properties:
      - structure: A 3x3 area in the grid.
      - frame_color: The single non-zero color (C1) occupying all 8 border cells of the 3x3 area.
      - center_color: The non-zero color (C2) in the center cell of the 3x3 area.
      - condition: Frame color (C1) must be different from center color (C2). Both C1 and C2 must be non-zero.
  - background_color: 0

actions:
  - name: Identify Framed Objects
    description: Scan the grid to find all instances matching the 'Framed Object' definition.
  - name: Classify Framed Objects
    description: Based on the specific pair of (frame_color C1, center_color C2), classify the object for modification or removal.
    rules:
      - category: Keep and Modify Center
        pairs: # (C1, C2) -> New C2
          - [3, 4, 2] # Frame=3, Center=4 -> New Center=2
          - [6, 1, 3] # Frame=6, Center=1 -> New Center=3
          - [8, 3, 2] # Frame=8, Center=3 -> New Center=2
          - [1, 4, 8] # Frame=1, Center=4 -> New Center=8
          - [1, 2, 9] # Frame=1, Center=2 -> New Center=9
          - [7, 4, 3] # Frame=7, Center=4 -> New Center=3
      - category: Remove Object
        pairs: # (C1, C2)
          - [1, 3]
          - [2, 6]
          - [3, 2]
          - [4, 8]
          - [4, 3]
          - [3, 6]
          - [2, 9]
          - [4, 2] # Added based on Example 1 results
  - name: Apply Transformations
    description: Create the output grid by applying the classified actions.
    steps:
      - Copy the input grid to the output grid.
      - Identify all coordinates belonging to objects marked for removal.
      - Identify all center coordinates and their new colors for objects marked for modification.
      - Apply removals: Set all identified removal coordinates in the output grid to the background color (0).
      - Apply modifications: For each modification (r, c, new_color), if the coordinate (r, c) was *not* part of a removed object, update the cell (r, c) in the output grid to new_color.

relationships:
  - The transformation applied to a framed object (modification or removal) is determined solely by the combination of its frame color (C1) and its center color (C2).
  - Cells not part of any identified framed object remain unchanged in the output.
  - Removals take precedence over modifications if a modified center cell coordinate is also part of a 3x3 area marked for removal.
