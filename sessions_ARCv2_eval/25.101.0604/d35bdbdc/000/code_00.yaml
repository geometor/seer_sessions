task_description: Modify or remove specific 3x3 patterns within a grid based on the colors of the frame and center.

definitions:
  - object: Framed Object
    properties:
      - structure: A 3x3 area in the grid.
      - frame_color: The single non-zero color (C1) occupying all 8 border cells of the 3x3 area.
      - center_color: The non-zero color (C2) in the center cell of the 3x3 area.
      - condition: Frame color (C1) must be different from center color (C2). Both C1 and C2 must be non-zero.
  - background_color: 0

actions:
  - name: Identify Framed Objects
    description: Scan the grid to find all instances matching the 'Framed Object' definition.
  - name: Classify Framed Objects
    description: Based on the specific pair of (frame_color C1, center_color C2), classify the object for modification or removal.
    rules:
      - category: Keep and Modify Center
        pairs: # (C1, C2) -> New C2
          - [3, 4, 2] # Frame=3, Center=4 -> New Center=2
          - [6, 1, 3] # Frame=6, Center=1 -> New Center=3
          - [8, 3, 2] # Frame=8, Center=3 -> New Center=2
          - [1, 4, 8] # Frame=1, Center=4 -> New Center=8
          - [1, 2, 9] # Frame=1, Center=2 -> New Center=9
          - [7, 4, 3] # Frame=7, Center=4 -> New Center=3
      - category: Remove Object
        pairs: # (C1, C2)
          - [1, 3]
          - [2, 6]
          - [3, 2]
          - [4, 8]
          - [4, 3]
          - [3, 6]
          - [2, 9]
  - name: Apply Transformations
    description: Create the output grid by applying the classified actions.
    steps:
      - Copy the input grid to the output grid.
      - For 'Keep and Modify Center' objects, update the center cell in the output grid with the new color.
      - For 'Remove Object' objects, set all 9 cells (frame and center) of the object in the output grid to the background color (0).
    precedence: Removals potentially override modifications if a modified center cell is part of a removed frame.

relationships:
  - The fate of a framed object (modification or removal) is determined solely by the combination of its frame color and its center color.
  - Cells not part of any identified framed object remain unchanged in the output.
