            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of digits (0-9). The digit 0 typically represents a background color.\n2.  **Objects:** The non-zero digits form various shapes or objects. A recurring pattern is a 3x3 square where the 8 border cells share one non-zero color (the \"frame\") and the center cell contains a different non-zero color (the \"interior\" or \"center\"). Other non-zero shapes also exist, sometimes connected, sometimes isolated.\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation appears to target these specific \"3x3 framed objects\". Other shapes and background cells seem unaffected *unless* they are part of a targeted 3x3 framed object that gets removed.\n4.  **Conditional Logic:** Whether a framed object is modified or removed depends entirely on the specific pair of colors: the frame color (C1) and the center color (C2).\n5.  **Modification vs. Removal:**\n    *   Some (C1, C2) pairs cause the center cell C2 to change to a new color C3, while the frame C1 remains untouched.\n    *   Other (C1, C2) pairs cause the *entire* 3x3 object (frame and center) to be removed (replaced with the background color 0).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_description: Modify or remove specific 3x3 patterns within a grid based on the colors of the frame and center.\n\ndefinitions:\n  - object: Framed Object\n    properties:\n      - structure: A 3x3 area in the grid.\n      - frame_color: The single non-zero color (C1) occupying all 8 border cells of the 3x3 area.\n      - center_color: The non-zero color (C2) in the center cell of the 3x3 area.\n      - condition: Frame color (C1) must be different from center color (C2). Both C1 and C2 must be non-zero.\n  - background_color: 0\n\nactions:\n  - name: Identify Framed Objects\n    description: Scan the grid to find all instances matching the 'Framed Object' definition.\n  - name: Classify Framed Objects\n    description: Based on the specific pair of (frame_color C1, center_color C2), classify the object for modification or removal.\n    rules:\n      - category: Keep and Modify Center\n        pairs: # (C1, C2) -> New C2\n          - [3, 4, 2] # Frame=3, Center=4 -> New Center=2\n          - [6, 1, 3] # Frame=6, Center=1 -> New Center=3\n          - [8, 3, 2] # Frame=8, Center=3 -> New Center=2\n          - [1, 4, 8] # Frame=1, Center=4 -> New Center=8\n          - [1, 2, 9] # Frame=1, Center=2 -> New Center=9\n          - [7, 4, 3] # Frame=7, Center=4 -> New Center=3\n      - category: Remove Object\n        pairs: # (C1, C2)\n          - [1, 3]\n          - [2, 6]\n          - [3, 2]\n          - [4, 8]\n          - [4, 3]\n          - [3, 6]\n          - [2, 9]\n  - name: Apply Transformations\n    description: Create the output grid by applying the classified actions.\n    steps:\n      - Copy the input grid to the output grid.\n      - For 'Keep and Modify Center' objects, update the center cell in the output grid with the new color.\n      - For 'Remove Object' objects, set all 9 cells (frame and center) of the object in the output grid to the background color (0).\n    precedence: Removals potentially override modifications if a modified center cell is part of a removed frame.\n\nrelationships:\n  - The fate of a framed object (modification or removal) is determined solely by the combination of its frame color and its center color.\n  - Cells not part of any identified framed object remain unchanged in the output.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2.  Create a list to store coordinates and new values for modifications (`modifications`).\n3.  Create a set to store coordinates of cells to be removed (`removals`).\n4.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid that could be the center of a 3x3 object (i.e., where `1 <= r < height-1` and `1 <= c < width-1`).\n5.  For each potential center `(r, c)`:\n    a.  Check if all 8 neighboring cells have the same non-zero color, `C1`.\n    b.  Check if the center cell `(r, c)` has a non-zero color, `C2`, such that `C1 != C2`.\n    c.  If both conditions (a) and (b) are true, a \"Framed Object\" is found with frame `C1` and center `C2`.\n    d.  Check the pair `(C1, C2)`:\n        i.  If `(C1, C2)` is one of `(3,4)`, `(6,1)`, `(8,3)`, `(1,4)`, `(1,2)`, or `(7,4)`, determine the corresponding new center color (`2`, `3`, `2`, `8`, `9`, or `3` respectively) and add the modification `(r, c, new_color)` to the `modifications` list.\n        ii. If `(C1, C2)` is one of `(1,3)`, `(2,6)`, `(3,2)`, `(4,8)`, `(4,3)`, `(3,6)`, or `(2,9)`, add the coordinates of all 9 cells of the 3x3 object (center `(r, c)` and its 8 neighbors) to the `removals` set.\n6.  Apply the removals: Iterate through all coordinates `(rr, cc)` in the `removals` set and set the corresponding cell in the output grid to `0`.\n7.  Apply the modifications: Iterate through each modification `(r, c, new_color)` in the `modifications` list. If the coordinate `(r, c)` is *not* present in the `removals` set, update the cell `(r, c)` in the output grid to `new_color`.\n8.  Return the final output grid."
