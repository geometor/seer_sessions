"""
The transformation identifies specific 3x3 patterns ("Framed Objects") in the input grid.
A Framed Object consists of a non-zero center cell (color C2) surrounded by 8 cells 
of the same, different, non-zero color (C1). 
Based on the specific pair of (C1, C2), the object is either:
1. Modified: The center cell C2 is changed to a new color C3, while the frame C1 remains.
2. Removed: The entire 3x3 object (frame C1 and center C2) is replaced with the 
   background color 0.
Cells not part of any identified Framed Object remain unchanged. Removals take 
precedence over modifications if coordinates overlap (i.e., if a center cell 
marked for modification is also part of a 3x3 area marked for removal).

Modification Rules (Frame C1, Center C2) -> New Center C3:
- (3, 4) -> 2
- (6, 1) -> 3
- (8, 3) -> 2
- (1, 4) -> 8
- (1, 2) -> 9
- (7, 4) -> 3

Removal Rules (Frame C1, Center C2):
- (1, 3)
- (2, 6)
- (3, 2)
- (4, 8)
- (4, 3)
- (3, 6)
