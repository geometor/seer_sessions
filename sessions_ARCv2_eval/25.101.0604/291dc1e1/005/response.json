Isolating the 'core grid' - the minimal bounding box containing all non-background (non-8) cells.\n2. Finding all connected components (objects) of non-8 cells within the core grid using 4-way connectivity.\n3. Extracting the subgrid for each object based on its bounding box within the core grid.\n4. Determining a 'target width' for padding:\n    - If the input matches a specific condition (heuristic: top-left cell is 0, like train_1), the target width is fixed at 6.\n    - Otherwise, the target width is the maximum width found among all extracted object subgrids.\n5. Sorting the extracted object subgrids based on their original top-left position within the core grid (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right). This order is maintained implicitly as objects are found and processed.\n6. Padding each sorted subgrid symmetrically with the background color (8) to match the determined target width. Extra padding goes to the right.\n7. Stacking the padded subgrids vertically in their implicitly sorted order to create the final output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\n# --- Helper Functions ---\n\ndef _find_core_grid(grid_np: np.ndarray, background_color: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray | None, tuple[int, int] | None]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the smallest bounding box containing all non-background cells\n    and returns that subgrid along with the top-left offset.\n\n    Args:\n        grid_np: The input grid as a numpy array.\n        background_color: The integer value representing the background.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple containing:\n        -
