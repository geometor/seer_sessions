Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are grids of numbers (0-9).
2.  **Core Data vs. Borders:** The input grids have border rows/columns often marked with `0`, `1`, or `2`. The central part of the input grid, typically padded with `8`s, contains the essential information. The digit `8` seems to act as a background or separator color.
3.  **Objects:** Within the core input grid, there are distinct shapes or "objects" formed by connected cells containing digits other than `8`. These objects are composed of one or more non-`8` digits. Connectivity appears to be 4-way (up, down, left, right).
4.  **Transformation:** The core task is to identify these non-`8` objects, extract them, potentially resize/pad them, and arrange them vertically to form the output grid.
5.  **Padding:** Padding with the digit `8` is applied to some extracted objects to adjust their width.
6.  **Ordering:** The extracted and potentially padded objects are stacked vertically in the output. Their order seems determined by their original top-to-bottom, left-to-right position in the input grid.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task_description: Extract connected non-background objects from a core grid, pad them to a consistent width determined by the widest object, and stack them vertically.

definitions:
  grid: A 2D array of digits.
  background_color: 8
  border_markers: [0, 1, 2] # Digits indicating border rows/columns
  core_grid: The portion of the input grid excluding border rows/columns and potentially outer layers of background_color.
  object: A connected component of cells in the core_grid containing digits other than the background_color. Connectivity is 4-way.
  bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing an object.
  object_subgrid: The content of the grid within an object's bounding box.

actions:
  - identify_core_grid: Determine the relevant subgrid from the input, excluding borders.
  - find_objects: Locate all connected components of non-background_color digits within the core_grid.
  - extract_subgrids: For each object, extract the subgrid corresponding to its bounding_box.
  - determine_target_width: Find the maximum width among all extracted object_subgrids.
  - pad_subgrids: For each extracted object_subgrid whose width is less than the target_width, pad it symmetrically with the background_color on the left and right until its width equals the target_width.
  - order_subgrids: Arrange the (potentially padded) subgrids based on the top-left coordinate of their corresponding object's bounding_box in the core_grid (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right).
  - concatenate_subgrids: Stack the ordered subgrids vertically to create the final output grid.

relationships:
  - The output grid is composed of modified representations of the objects found in the input's core_grid.
  - The width of the output grid is determined by the width of the widest object found in the input's core_grid.
  - The order of object representations in the output corresponds to the spatial order of the objects in the input.
  - Padding uses the background_color (8).

observation_notes:
  - This rule accurately describes the transformation for examples train_2, train_3, and train_4.
  - Example train_1 appears anomalous under this rule. Its output width (6) does not match the maximum object width (2), and some output subgrids do not seem to result from simple padding of the extracted objects (e.g., `1 2 6 6 6 6` from `[[1,6],[2,6]]`). Further investigation might be needed for train_1, possibly involving a different padding rule or object manipulation based on aspect ratio or other properties specific to that example's border markers.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Core Grid:** Examine the input grid. Ignore any border rows or columns potentially indicated by markers like 0, 1, or 2. The core grid is the central area containing patterns surrounded by the background color 8.
2.  **Find Objects:** Scan the core grid to find all connected areas (objects) made of digits *not* equal to 8. Use 4-way connectivity (up, down, left, right) to define connections. Keep track of the pixels belonging to each distinct object.
3.  **Extract Object Subgrids:** For each identified object, determine its bounding box (the smallest rectangle containing all its pixels). Extract the subgrid of digits within this bounding box.
4.  **Determine Target Width:** Examine all the extracted object subgrids and find the maximum width among them. This maximum width will be the target width for the output blocks.
5.  **Order Objects:** Sort the extracted object subgrids based on the original position of their corresponding object's top-left corner in the core grid. The primary sort key is the row index (top to bottom), and the secondary key is the column index (left to right).
6.  **Pad and Assemble:** Process the sorted object subgrids one by one:
    *   Take the current object subgrid.
    *   If its width is less than the target width calculated in step 4, add columns of the background color 8 symmetrically to its left and right sides until its width matches the target width. (If an odd number of padding columns are needed, add the extra column to the right).
    *   Append this (potentially padded) subgrid to the bottom of the final output grid being built.
7.  **Final Output:** The fully assembled grid after processing all objects is the final output.
