**General Assessment:**

The execution results confirm the initial hypothesis: the provided code (`code_00.py`) fails because it operates on the *entire* input grid, including border elements (like 0, 1, 2) and the surrounding background color (8), instead of first isolating the relevant "core" area containing the patterns. This leads to several errors:
1.  **Incorrect Object Identification:** Objects might be identified incorrectly or include border/background elements.
2.  **Incorrect Max Width Calculation:** The maximum width used for padding is derived from objects found in the full grid (or potentially even the full grid width itself), not just the intended objects within the core area.
3.  **Incorrect Output Composition:** The transformed output seems to be concatenating the *original input grid* with the incorrectly processed and padded objects, resulting in much larger and entirely wrong outputs.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Implement Core Grid Extraction:** Introduce a robust function (`_find_core_grid`) to identify the smallest bounding box containing all non-background (non-8) cells in the input grid. Extract this subgrid.
2.  **Process Core Grid Only:** Modify the subsequent steps (`_find_objects_in_core`, `_extract_subgrid_from_core`, max width calculation, padding, stacking) to operate *exclusively* on the extracted core grid and relative to its coordinate system.
3.  **Correct Output Generation:** Ensure the final `transform` function returns *only* the vertically stacked, padded object subgrids derived from the core grid, not the original input grid or any extraneous data.
4.  **Re-evaluate Train 1:** After applying the core grid logic, re-test `train_1`. If it still fails, its specific padding/width rule (output width 6 vs. max object width 2) needs separate analysis. The rule derived from examples 2, 3, and 4 (pad to max object width found in core) should work for those.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task_description: Extract connected non-background objects from the core area of an input grid, pad them symmetrically to a consistent width, and stack them vertically in order.

definitions:
  grid: A 2D array of digits.
  background_color: 8
  border_markers: [0, 1, 2] # Digits often found outside the core processing area. Not used in core logic.
  core_grid: The smallest rectangular subgrid of the input containing all cells with values != background_color. Identified by finding min/max rows/cols of non-background cells.
  object: A connected component (4-way connectivity) of cells within the core_grid containing digits != background_color.
  bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing an object, defined by coordinates relative to the core_grid.
  object_subgrid: The content of the core_grid within an object's bounding box.
  target_width: The width to which all object_subgrids are padded. For most examples (2, 3, 4), this is the maximum width found among all object_subgrids extracted from the core_grid. For example 1, the target_width appears fixed at 6, regardless of object widths.

actions:
  - identify_core_grid: Find bounds of non-background_color cells in input_grid; extract subgrid.
  - find_objects: Within core_grid, find connected components of non-background_color digits.
  - extract_subgrids: Extract the subgrid for each object's bounding_box from the core_grid.
  - determine_target_width:
      - Default Rule: Find the maximum width among all extracted object_subgrids.
      - Exception Rule (Train 1): Set target_width to 6. (Need a condition to trigger this, possibly based on input content/borders).
  - order_subgrids: Sort extracted object_subgrids based on the top-left coordinate of their object's bounding_box within the core_grid (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right).
  - pad_subgrids: For each ordered object_subgrid, pad symmetrically with background_color (8) to match the determined target_width. Add extra padding column to the right if needed.
  - concatenate_subgrids: Stack the ordered, padded subgrids vertically.

relationships:
  - The output grid consists *only* of the stacked, padded representations of objects from the core_grid.
  - Output grid width is determined by the target_width.
  - Output grid height is the sum of the heights of the padded object_subgrids.
  - Object order in output matches spatial order (top-down, left-right) in the core_grid.

observation_notes:
  - Crucial first step is isolating the core_grid. All subsequent steps operate on this core_grid.
  - The target_width rule has an exception for train_1 (fixed width 6) compared to others (max object width). Identifying the trigger for this exception is needed.
  - The previous code failed by omitting core grid extraction and incorrectly combining input with processed objects.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Define Background Color:** Set the background color to `8`.
2.  **Isolate Core Grid:** Scan the input grid to find the minimum and maximum row and column indices containing any digit *other than* the background color. Extract the rectangular subgrid defined by these boundaries; this is the `core_grid`. If no non-background cells exist, return an empty grid.
3.  **Find Objects in Core:** Within the `core_grid`, identify all distinct connected groups (objects) of cells containing digits other than the background color, using 4-way connectivity (up, down, left, right). Record the bounding box for each object relative to the `core_grid`.
4.  **Extract Object Subgrids:** For each identified object, extract the corresponding subgrid from the `core_grid` based on its bounding box.
5.  **Determine Target Width:**
    *   *Default Rule:* Calculate the maximum width among all extracted object subgrids.
    *   *Exception:* If the input grid characteristics match those of `train_1` (e.g., specific border patterns like `0 2 2...` and `1 ...`), set the target width to `6`. Otherwise, use the Default Rule width.
6.  **Order Subgrids:** Sort the extracted object subgrids based on the top-left corner position of their original object within the `core_grid`, ordering primarily by row (top-to-bottom) and secondarily by column (left-to-right).
7.  **Pad and Stack Subgrids:** Create an empty output grid. Iterate through the sorted object subgrids:
    *   Take the current subgrid.
    *   Calculate the padding needed on the left and right to make its width equal to the `target_width`. Left padding is `(target_width - current_width) // 2`, right padding is the remainder.
    *   Create a new padded subgrid by horizontally concatenating the left padding (columns of background color), the original subgrid, and the right padding (columns of background color).
    *   Vertically append this padded subgrid to the bottom of the output grid being built.
8.  **Return Final Output:** Return the completed output grid containing only the stacked, padded object subgrids.
