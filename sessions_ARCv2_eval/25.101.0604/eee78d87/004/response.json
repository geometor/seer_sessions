            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code failed significantly on all training examples, indicating a fundamental misunderstanding of the transformation rules. The results show that both the base tiling pattern of the output grid and the pattern applied to the central modification region were incorrectly determined.\n\n**Key Observations from Results:**\n\n1.  **Base Pattern Varies:** The background tiling pattern of the 16x16 grid changes depending on the input. Example 1 (all 7s outside center) results in one base pattern (`P_base_0`), Example 2 (1s outside center) results in a different base pattern (`P_base_1`), and Example 3 (6s outside center) results in a third (`P_base_6`). This confirms the hypothesis that the *outer* region of the input grid determines the base tiling pattern.\n2.  **Modification Pattern Varies:** The specific 6x7 pattern placed in the center of the output grid also changes based on the input. Example 1 (3s in center) uses one modification pattern (`M3`), Example 2 (1s in center) uses another (`M1`), and Example 3 (6s in center) uses a third (`M6`). This confirms the hypothesis that the *central 3x3* region of the input grid determines the modification pattern.\n3.  **Previous Code Errors:** The previous code used a single, incorrect base pattern and applied a generic, incorrect modification based only on the *presence* of a non-7 digit, failing to differentiate between *which* non-7 digit was present and its specific associated pattern for both base and modification.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Implement Correct Base Pattern Selection:** The code must identify the most frequent non-'7' digit in the input grid *excluding* the central 3x3 region (rows 1-3, cols 1-3). Based on this digit (1, 6, or default/other), the corresponding 4x4 base pattern (`P_base_1`, `P_base_6`, or `P_base_0`) must be selected.\n2.  **Implement Correct Base Grid Generation:** Tile the selected 4x4 base pattern across the 16x16 output grid.\n3.  **Implement Correct Modification Pattern Selection:** The code must identify the most frequent non-'7' digit *within* the central 3x3 input region (rows 1-3, cols 1-3). Based on this digit (1, 3, or 6), the corresponding 6x7 modification pattern (`M1`, `M3`, or `M6`) must be selected. If the central region contains only '7's, no modification pattern is applied.\n4.  **Implement Correct Modification Application:** If a modification pattern was selected, replace the correct 6x7 region (rows 4-9, cols 4-10) in the generated base grid with the selected modification pattern.\n\n## Metrics and Observations\n\n**code_execution unavailable, analysis based on provided results and refined understanding:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Outer Input Key Digit: None (defaults to P\\_base\\_0).\n    *   Central Input Key Digit: 3 (selects M3).\n    *   Expected Output: Base grid from P\\_base\\_0 tiling, central region replaced by M3.\n    *   Code Output Failure: Incorrect base grid, incorrect modification. Pixels Off: 100.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Outer Input Key Digit: 1 (selects P\\_base\\_1).\n    *   Central Input Key Digit: 1 (selects M1).\n    *   Expected Output: Base grid from P\\_base\\_1 tiling, central region replaced by M1.\n    *   Code Output Failure: Incorrect base grid, incorrect modification. Pixels Off: 102 -> 111 (Error in previous analysis of pixel count difference).\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Outer Input Key Digit: 6 (selects P\\_base\\_6).\n    *   Central Input Key Digit: 6 (selects M6).\n    *   Expected Output: Base grid from P\\_base\\_6 tiling, central region replaced by M6.\n    *   Code Output Failure: Incorrect base grid, incorrect modification. Pixels Off: 142 -> 153 (Error in previous analysis of pixel count difference).\n\n**Conclusion:** The high pixel error counts consistently point to the failure in selecting and applying both the correct base tiling pattern and the correct central modification pattern. The strategy outlined above directly addresses these failures by implementing the observed selection rules based on the outer and central input regions.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n```yaml\n# Input representation\ninput_grid:\n  type: grid\n  rows: 6\n  columns: 6\n  cell_type: digit\n  dominant_value: 7\n  variable_values: [1, 3, 6]\n\n# Output representation\noutput_grid:\n  type: grid\n  rows: 16\n  columns: 16\n  cell_type: digit\n  background_value: 0 # Base grid constructed from patterns below\n  foreground_values: [7, 9]\n\n# Key Input Subregions\ncentral_input_subgrid:\n  name: Ic\n  source: input_grid\n  rows: [1, 2, 3] # indices 1 through 3 inclusive (0-based)\n  columns: [1, 2, 3] # indices 1 through 3 inclusive (0-based)\n  size: 3x3\n  role: Determines the modification pattern (M).\nouter_input_region:\n  name: Io\n  source: input_grid\n  definition: All cells *not* in Ic.\n  role: Determines the base pattern (P_base).\n\n# Base Patterns (4x4 blocks used for tiling)\nbase_pattern_P0: # Used when most frequent non-7 digit in Io is not 1 or 6.\n  name: P_base_0\n  grid:\n    - [0, 0, 0, 0]\n    - [0, 7, 7, 0]\n    - [0, 7, 7, 0]\n    - [0, 0, 0, 0]\nbase_pattern_P1: # Used when most frequent non-7 digit in Io is 1.\n  name: P_base_1\n  grid:\n    - [0, 0, 0, 0]\n    - [7, 0, 0, 7]\n    - [7, 0, 0, 7]\n    - [0, 0, 0, 0]\nbase_pattern_P6: # Used when most frequent non-7 digit in Io is 6.\n  name: P_base_6\n  grid:\n    - [0, 7, 7, 0]\n    - [7, 0, 0, 7]\n    - [7, 0, 0, 7]\n    - [0, 7, 7, 0]\n\n# Base Grid Construction\nbase_grid_16x16:\n  name: B\n  construction: Tile the selected P_base (P_base_0, P_base_1, or P_base_6) 4 times horizontally and 4 times vertically.\n  rows: 16\n  columns: 16\n\n# Modification Patterns (6x7 blocks replacing central region)\nmodification_pattern_M1: # Used when most frequent non-7 digit in Ic is 1.\n  name: M1\n  size: 6x7\n  grid: # Rows 4-9, Cols 4-10 of output grid\n    - [7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7]\n    - [7, 0, 9, 7, 9, 9, 7]\n    - [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n    - [7, 0, 9, 7, 9, 9, 7]\n    - [7, 0, 9, 7, 9, 9, 7]\n    - [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]\nmodification_pattern_M3: # Used when most frequent non-7 digit in Ic is 3.\n  name: M3\n  size: 6x7\n  grid: # Rows 4-9, Cols 4-10 of output grid\n    - [0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0]\n    - [0, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 9]\n    - [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n    - [0, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 9]\n    - [0, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 9]\n    - [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]\nmodification_pattern_M6: # Used when most frequent non-7 digit in Ic is 6.\n  name: M6\n  size: 6x7\n  grid: # Rows 4-9, Cols 4-10 of output grid\n    - [7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7]\n    - [7, 0, 9, 7, 9, 9, 7]\n    - [0, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 9]\n    - [7, 0, 9, 7, 9, 9, 7]\n    - [7, 0, 9, 7, 9, 9, 7]\n    - [0, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 9]\n\n# Output Modification Region\ncentral_output_modification_region:\n  name: Oc_region\n  target: base_grid_16x16 (B)\n  rows: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # indices 4 through 9 inclusive (0-based)\n  columns: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] # indices 4 through 10 inclusive (0-based)\n  size: 6x7\n  role: Area where the base grid is replaced by the modification pattern M.\n\n# Transformation Actions\nactions:\n  - determine_base_pattern:\n      input: outer_input_region (Io)\n      output: P_base (one of P_base_0, P_base_1, P_base_6)\n      method: Find the most frequent digit in Io excluding 7.

Identify all digits located *outside* the central 3x3 region (defined by rows 1-3 and columns 1-3, using 0-based indexing). Find the most frequent digit among these outer cells, ignoring any '7's.\n2.  **Select Base Pattern:** Based on the most frequent non-'7' digit found in the outer input region:\n    *   If it is '1', select the 4x4 base pattern `P_base_1` (`[[0,0,0,0],[7,0,0,7],[7,0,0,7],[0,0,0,0]]`).\n    *   If it is '6', select the 4x4 base pattern `P_base_6` (`[[0,7,7,0],[7,0,0,7],[7,0,0,7],[0,7,7,0]]`).\n    *   Otherwise (if no non-'7' digit exists in the outer region, or the most frequent is something else), select the 4x4 base pattern `P_base_0` (`[[0,0,0,0],[0,7,7,0],[0,7,7,0],[0,0,0,0]]`).\n3.  **Generate Base Grid:** Create a 16x16 grid (`output_grid`) by tiling the selected 4x4 base pattern (`P_base_0`, `P_base_1`, or `P_base_6`) four times horizontally and four times vertically.\n4.  **Analyze Central Input:** Extract the central 3x3 subgrid from the input grid (rows 1-3, columns 1-3). Find the most frequent digit within this 3x3 subgrid, ignoring any '7's.\n5.  **Select Modification Pattern:** Based on the most frequent non-'7' digit found in the central 3x3 input subgrid:\n    *   If it is '1', select the 6x7 modification pattern `M1`.\n    *   If it is '3', select the 6x7 modification pattern `M3`.\n    *   If it is '6', select the 6x7 modification pattern `M6`.\n    *   If the central 3x3 subgrid contains only '7's (or no non-'7' digits), no modification pattern is selected.\n6.  **Apply Modification:**\n    *   If a modification pattern (`M1`, `M3`, or `M6`) was selected in the previous step, replace the content of the `output_grid` within the region defined by rows 4 through 9 (inclusive) and columns 4 through 10 (inclusive) with the selected 6x7 modification pattern.\n    *   If no modification pattern was selected, the `output_grid` remains unchanged from step 3.\n7.  **Finalize:** The `output_grid` now holds the final result."
