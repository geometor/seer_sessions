*   **Perception**: The task involves rearranging subgrids extracted from an input grid. The input grids contain subgrids separated by lines or columns composed entirely of the digit '6'. The arrangement of these separators (horizontal, vertical, or both) determines how the subgrids are extracted and how they are reassembled in the output. The reassembly involves changing the orientation (e.g., vertically stacked input blocks become horizontally arranged output blocks) and potentially the order of the blocks.

*   **Facts**:
    ```yaml
    task_type: grid_rearrangement
    components:
      - object: grid
        attributes:
          - type: input_grid
          - type: output_grid
          - content: matrix of digits
      - object: separator
        attributes:
          - value: 6
          - role: delimiter
          - type: horizontal_line (row of 6s)
          - type: vertical_column (column of 6s)
      - object: subgrid
        attributes:
          - content: portion of the input grid delimited by separators
          - role: element_to_be_rearranged
    relationships:
      - separators divide the input_grid into subgrids
      - subgrids from input_grid are assembled into output_grid
    actions:
      - identify_separators: Find horizontal lines and vertical columns of '6's in the input_grid.
      - split_grid: Divide the input_grid into subgrids based on the identified separators.
      - determine_arrangement: Classify the input arrangement based on separator orientation (vertical blocks, horizontal blocks, or quadrants).
      - reassemble_grid: Construct the output_grid by arranging the extracted subgrids according to specific rules based on the input arrangement.
        rules:
          - if input has horizontal separators only (vertical blocks):
              - arrange blocks horizontally in output
              - use vertical '6' columns as separators
              - reverse the order of blocks (bottom block first)
          - if input has vertical separators only (horizontal blocks):
              - arrange blocks vertically in output
              - use horizontal '6' lines as separators
              - preserve the order of blocks (left block first)
          - if input has central horizontal and vertical separators (quadrants):
              - arrange quadrants vertically in output
              - use horizontal '6' lines as separators
              - specific order: Top-Left, Bottom-Right, Top-Right, Bottom-Left
    ```

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Scan the input grid to locate all complete horizontal rows and complete vertical columns consisting solely of the digit '6'. These are the separators.
    2.  Analyze the configuration of separators:
        a.  **Vertical Blocks**: If only horizontal separator rows exist, they divide the grid into vertically stacked subgrids.
        b.  **Horizontal Blocks**: If only vertical separator columns exist, they divide the grid into horizontally arranged subgrids.
        c.  **Quadrants**: If a central horizontal row and a central vertical column of separators exist, they divide the grid into four quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).
    3.  Extract the subgrids, excluding the separator lines/columns themselves.
    4.  Construct the output grid based on the identified configuration:
        a.  For **Vertical Blocks**: Arrange the extracted subgrids horizontally, placing the bottom-most input subgrid first (on the left), followed by the next subgrid up, and so on, ending with the top-most input subgrid (on the right). Separate adjacent subgrids in the output with a single vertical column of '6's.
        b.  For **Horizontal Blocks**: Arrange the extracted subgrids vertically, placing the left-most input subgrid first (at the top), followed by the next subgrid to its right, and so on, ending with the right-most input subgrid (at the bottom). Separate adjacent subgrids in the output with a single horizontal row of '6's.
        c.  For **Quadrants**: Arrange the extracted quadrants vertically in the specific order: Top-Left, Bottom-Right, Top-Right, Bottom-Left. Separate adjacent quadrants in the output with a single horizontal row of '6's.

Train Set Error: syntax error:
unexpected indent (<unknown>, line 168)
*   **General Assessment**:
    *   The primary issue reported is a `syntax error: unexpected indent (<unknown>, line 168)`, which prevented the code from running on any examples. This error likely occurs in the `transform` function's final `else` block or the return statement, suggesting improper indentation.
    *   Ignoring the syntax error, the *intended* logic described in the previous natural language program and attempted in the code appears sound and covers the three distinct transformation patterns observed in the training examples:
        1.  **Quadrant Split (train\_1)**: Input split by central horizontal and vertical '6' lines -> Output quadrants stacked vertically in a specific order (TL, BR, TR, BL) separated by horizontal '6' lines.
        2.  **Vertical Split (train\_2)**: Input split by horizontal '6' lines -> Output blocks arranged horizontally in *reverse* vertical order (bottom-to-top becomes left-to-right), separated by vertical '6' columns.
        3.  **Horizontal Split (train\_3)**: Input split by vertical '6' lines -> Output blocks arranged vertically in *original* horizontal order (left-to-right becomes top-to-bottom), separated by horizontal '6' lines.
    *   The strategy is to:
        1.  Assume the syntax error will be fixed by the coder.
        2.  Confirm that the existing logic correctly handles all three training cases based on a manual walkthrough.
        3.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program for clarity and precision based on the analysis of all examples.

    components:
      - object: grid
        attributes:
          - type: input_grid
          - type: output_grid
          - content: matrix of digits (integers)

        attributes:
          - content: rectangular portion of the input grid delimited by separators or grid boundaries
          - role: element_to_be_rearranged
    relationships:
      - separators divide the input_grid into subgrids.
      - The configuration of separators (horizontal only, vertical only, or both central) determines the transformation rule.
      - Subgrids are extracted from the input_grid.
      - Extracted subgrids are reassembled, potentially changing orientation (vertical<->horizontal) and order, to form the output_grid.
      - Single lines/columns of '6's are used as separators in the output_grid.
    actions:
      - identify_separators: Find all row indices `h_seps` and column indices `v_seps` that consist entirely of '6'.
      - classify_configuration:
          - if only `h_seps` exist: Vertical Blocks configuration.
          - if only `v_seps` exist: Horizontal Blocks configuration.
          - if exactly one `h_sep` and one `v_sep` exist: Quadrants configuration.
          - else: Undefined or Default (e.g., return input - though not seen in examples).
      - extract_subgrids: Divide the input grid into non-separator subgrids based on `h_seps` and `v_seps`.
      - reassemble_grid: Construct the output grid based on the configuration:
          - Vertical Blocks: Assemble subgrids horizontally, separated by vertical '6' columns. The order of subgrids is reversed relative to their top-to-bottom order in the input.
          - Horizontal Blocks: Assemble subgrids vertically, separated by horizontal '6' rows. The order of subgrids matches their left-to-right order in the input.
          - Quadrants: Identify the four quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right). Assemble them vertically, separated by horizontal '6' rows, in the specific order: Top-Left, Bottom-Right, Top-Right, Bottom-Left.
    ```

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify all horizontal rows and vertical columns in the input grid that consist entirely of the digit '6'. These are the separators. Record their row indices (`h_seps`) and column indices (`v_seps`).
    2.  Determine the input grid's configuration based on the separators found:
        a.  **Vertical Blocks**: If only horizontal separators (`h_seps`) exist (and `v_seps` is empty).
        b.  **Horizontal Blocks**: If only vertical separators (`v_seps`) exist (and `h_seps` is empty).
        c.  **Quadrants**: If exactly one horizontal separator (`h_seps` has one element) and exactly one vertical separator (`v_seps` has one element) exist.
    3.  Extract the subgrids defined by these separators (excluding the separators themselves).
    4.  Construct the output grid according to the configuration:
        a.  For **Vertical Blocks**: Arrange the extracted subgrids horizontally. The order is determined by taking the input subgrids from bottom to top and placing them left to right in the output. Separate adjacent output subgrids with a single vertical column of '6's.
        b.  For **Horizontal Blocks**: Arrange the extracted subgrids vertically. The order is determined by taking the input subgrids from left to right and placing them top to bottom in the output. Separate adjacent output subgrids with a single horizontal row of '6's.
        c.  For **Quadrants**: Identify the Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR) subgrids based on the single horizontal and vertical separators. Arrange these four subgrids vertically in the output in the specific sequence: TL, BR, TR, BL. Separate adjacent output subgrids with a single horizontal row of '6's.
    5.  If the separator configuration does not match any of the above defined cases (e.g., no separators, multiple separators crossing), the transformation rule is undefined by the examples (a potential fallback might be to return the input grid unchanged, although this scenario is not demonstrated).
