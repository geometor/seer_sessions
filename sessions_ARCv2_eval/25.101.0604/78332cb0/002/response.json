This error likely occurs in the `transform` function's final `else` block or the return statement, suggesting improper indentation.\n    *   Ignoring the syntax error, the *intended* logic described in the previous natural language program and attempted in the code appears sound and covers the three distinct transformation patterns observed in the training examples:\n        1.  **Quadrant Split (train\\_1)**: Input split by central horizontal and vertical '6' lines -> Output quadrants stacked vertically in a specific order (TL, BR, TR, BL) separated by horizontal '6' lines.\n        2.  **Vertical Split (train\\_2)**: Input split by horizontal '6' lines -> Output blocks arranged horizontally in *reverse* vertical order (bottom-to-top becomes left-to-right), separated by vertical '6' columns.\n        3.  **Horizontal Split (train\\_3)**: Input split by vertical '6' lines -> Output blocks arranged vertically in *original* horizontal order (left-to-right becomes top-to-bottom), separated by horizontal '6' lines.\n    *   The strategy is to:\n        1.  Assume the syntax error will be fixed by the coder.\n        2.  Confirm that the existing logic correctly handles all three training cases based on a manual walkthrough.\n        3.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program for clarity and precision based on the analysis of all examples.\n\n*   **Metrics**:\n    *   **code\\_execution**: Failed due to syntax error on all examples.\n    *   **Manual Walkthrough Analysis**:\n        *   `train_1`:\n            *   Input Grid: 11x11\n            *   Separators: Horizontal line at index 5, Vertical column at index 5.\n            *   Input Configuration: Quadrants (4 subgrids of size 5x5).\n            *   Expected Output (based on previous NLP): Vertical stack of 4 subgrids (5x5) separated by horizontal '6' lines (total size 23x5). Order: TL, BR, TR, BL.\n            *   Matches Actual Output: Yes.\n        *   `train_2`:\n            *   Input Grid: 17x5\n            *   Separators: Horizontal lines at indices 5, 11.\n            *   Input Configuration: Vertical Blocks (3 subgrids of size 5x5).\n            *   Expected Output (based on previous NLP): Horizontal arrangement of 3 subgrids (5x5) separated by vertical '6' columns (total size 5x17). Order: Bottom, Middle, Top.\n            *   Matches Actual Output: Yes.\n        *   `train_3`:\n            *   Input Grid: 5x17\n            *   Separators: Vertical columns at indices 5, 11.\n            *   Input Configuration: Horizontal Blocks (3 subgrids of size 5x5).\n            *   Expected Output (based on previous NLP): Vertical stack of 3 subgrids (5x5) separated by horizontal '6' lines (total size 17x5). Order: Left, Middle, Right.\n            *   Matches Actual Output: Yes.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    ```yaml\n    task_type: grid_rearrangement_conditional\n    components:\n      - object: grid\n        attributes:\n          - type: input_grid\n          - type: output_grid\n          - content: matrix of digits (integers)\n      - object: separator\n        attributes:\n          - value: 6\n          - role: delimiter\n          - type: horizontal_line (a full row of 6s)\n          - type: vertical_column (a full column of 6s)\n      - object: subgrid\n        attributes:\n          - content: rectangular portion of the input grid delimited by separators or grid boundaries\n          - role: element_to_be_rearranged\n    relationships:\n      - separators divide the input_grid into subgrids.\n      - The configuration of separators (horizontal only, vertical only, or both central) determines the transformation rule.\n      - Subgrids are extracted from the input_grid.\n      - Extracted subgrids are reassembled, potentially changing orientation (vertical<->horizontal) and order, to form the output_grid.\n      - Single lines/columns of '6's are used as separators in the output_grid.\n    actions:\n      - identify_separators: Find all row indices `h_seps` and column indices `v_seps` that consist entirely of '6'.\n      - classify_configuration:\n          - if only `h_seps` exist: Vertical Blocks configuration.\n          - if only `v_seps` exist: Horizontal Blocks configuration.\n          - if exactly one `h_sep` and one `v_sep` exist: Quadrants configuration.\n          - else: Undefined or Default (e.g., return input - though not seen in examples).\n      - extract_subgrids: Divide the input grid into non-separator subgrids based on `h_seps` and `v_seps`.\n      - reassemble_grid: Construct the output grid based on the configuration:\n          - Vertical Blocks: Assemble subgrids horizontally, separated by vertical '6' columns. The order of subgrids is reversed relative to their top-to-bottom order in the input.\n          - Horizontal Blocks: Assemble subgrids vertically, separated by horizontal '6' rows. The order of subgrids matches their left-to-right order in the input.\n          - Quadrants: Identify the four quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right). Assemble them vertically, separated by horizontal '6' rows, in the specific order: Top-Left, Bottom-Right, Top-Right, Bottom-Left.\n    ```\n\n*   **Natural Language Program**:\n    1.  Identify all horizontal rows and vertical columns in the input grid that consist entirely of the digit '6'. These are the separators. Record their row indices (`h_seps`) and column indices (`v_seps`).\n    2.  Determine the input grid's configuration based on the separators found:\n        a.  **Vertical Blocks**: If only horizontal separators (`h_seps`) exist (and `v_seps` is empty).\n        b.  **Horizontal Blocks**: If only vertical separators (`v_seps`) exist (and `h_seps` is empty).\n        c.  **Quadrants**: If exactly one horizontal separator (`h_seps` has one element) and exactly one vertical separator (`v_seps` has one element) exist.\n    3.  Extract the subgrids defined by these separators (excluding the separators themselves).\n    4.  Construct the output grid according to the configuration:\n        a.  For **Vertical Blocks**: Arrange the extracted subgrids horizontally. The order is determined by taking the input subgrids from bottom to top and placing them left to right in the output. Separate adjacent output subgrids with a single vertical column of '6's.\n        b.  For **Horizontal Blocks**: Arrange the extracted subgrids vertically. The order is determined by taking the input subgrids from left to right and placing them top to bottom in the output. Separate adjacent output subgrids with a single horizontal row of '6's.\n        c.  For **Quadrants**: Identify the Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR) subgrids based on the single horizontal and vertical separators. Arrange these four subgrids vertically in the output in the specific sequence: TL, BR, TR, BL. Separate adjacent output subgrids with a single horizontal row of '6's.\n    5.  If the separator configuration does not match any of the above defined cases (e.g., no separators, multiple separators crossing), the transformation rule is undefined by the examples (a potential fallback might be to return the input grid unchanged, although this scenario is not demonstrated)."
