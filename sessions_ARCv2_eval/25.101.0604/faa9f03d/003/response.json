Identifies horizontal segments defined by pairs of '2's. Changes boundaries to '3', fills the segment with '3', and places a '1' marker whose position depends on whether a '0' was originally present in the segment. Changes are applied to the working grid.\n\n2.  **4-7 Transformation (Rule 2):** Operates on the original input. Looks for a '4' immediately followed by a '7'. If found at (r, c) and (r, c+1), it copies the segment from the row below (r+1) up to column c-1 into the current row r of the working grid. It then replaces the '4' and subsequent cells (up to 3 more) with '3's in the working grid. Marks the '4' as processed.\n\n3.  **4-Alone Transformation (Rule 3):** Operates on the original input. Looks for a '4' that was *not* processed by Rule 2. If found at (r, c), it fills the column below it (from r+1 downwards) with '6's in the working grid.\n\n4.  **Horizontal Propagation (Rule 4):** Operates iteratively on the working grid. Fills horizontal gaps: any non-'1' cell between two '1's becomes '1', and any non-'6' cell between two '6's becomes '6'. This repeats per row until no changes occur.\n\n5.  **Vertical 1 Propagation (Rule 5):** Operates using the original input for context but modifies the working grid. If a '0' in the input grid is located vertically between two '1's, that cell in the working grid is changed to '1'. This happens after horizontal propagation.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_red_boundaries(row_data: list[int]) -> list[tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"Finds pairs of indices corresponding to the color 2 in a row.\"\"\"\n    indices = [i for i, color in enumerate(row_data) if color == 2]\n    pairs = []\n    # Simple pairing assuming non-overlapping boundaries as seen in examples\n    for i in range(0, len(indices), 2):\n        if i + 1 < len(indices):\n            pairs.append((indices[i], indices[i+1]))\n    return pairs\n\ndef check_zero_in_segment(row_data: list[int], c1: int, c2: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Checks if the color 0 exists in the row segment between c1+1 and c2-1.\"\"\"\n    if c1 + 1 >= c2: # Check if segment is empty or just boundaries\n        return False\n    # Ensure slice indices are within bounds\n    start = max(0, c1 + 1)\n    end = min(len(row_data), c2)\n    return 0 in row_data[start : end]\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    # Initialize output_grid as a deep copy of the input to modify\n    output_grid = copy.deepcopy(input_grid)\n    height = len(input_grid)\n    if height == 0:\n        return []\n    width = len(input_grid[0])\n    if width == 0:\n        return [[] for _ in range(height)]\n\n    processed_fours = set() # Keep track of (r, c) of '4's processed by Rule 2\n\n    # --- 1.
