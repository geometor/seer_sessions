"""
Transforms an input grid based on a sequence of rules applied iteratively or based on context from the original input grid:

1.  **Red Boundary Transformation (Rule 1):** Operates on the original input. Identifies horizontal segments defined by pairs of '2's. Changes boundaries to '3', fills the segment with '3', and places a '1' marker whose position depends on whether a '0' was originally present in the segment. Changes are applied to the working grid.

2.  **4-7 Transformation (Rule 2):** Operates on the original input. Looks for a '4' immediately followed by a '7'. If found at (r, c) and (r, c+1), it copies the segment from the row below (r+1) up to column c-1 into the current row r of the working grid. It then replaces the '4' and subsequent cells (up to 3 more) with '3's in the working grid. Marks the '4' as processed.

3.  **4-Alone Transformation (Rule 3):** Operates on the original input. Looks for a '4' that was *not* processed by Rule 2. If found at (r, c), it fills the column below it (from r+1 downwards) with '6's in the working grid.

4.  **Horizontal Propagation (Rule 4):** Operates iteratively on the working grid. Fills horizontal gaps: any non-'1' cell between two '1's becomes '1', and any non-'6' cell between two '6's becomes '6'. This repeats per row until no changes occur.

5.  **Vertical 1 Propagation (Rule 5):** Operates using the original input for context but modifies the working grid. If a '0' in the input grid is located vertically between two '1's, that cell in the working grid is changed to '1'. This happens after horizontal propagation.
