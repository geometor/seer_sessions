## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code, derived solely from `train_1`, correctly handled the Red Boundary (`2...2`) and basic Blue Propagation (`1...1`) rules. However, it failed on `train_2` and `train_3`, indicating the presence of additional rules triggered by other colors and patterns.

*   **`train_2` Failure:** The code missed the `4-7` transformation rule, which involves copying a segment from the row below and filling with color `3`. It also seems to have missed a horizontal propagation rule for color `3`.
*   **`train_3` Failure:** The code missed the `4-Alone` transformation rule, which involves changing the `4` to `6` and propagating `6` vertically downwards. It also didn't correctly handle the interaction between horizontal propagation (specifically for color `6`) and vertical propagation (for color `1`), and missed a cleanup rule affecting `6`s in specific rows.

The strategy is to:
1.  Incorporate the specific rules observed in `train_2` (`4-7` transform, horizontal `3` propagation) and `train_3` (`4-Alone` transform, vertical `1` propagation refinement, horizontal `6` propagation refinement, final cleanup rule).
2.  Refine the existing rules (like horizontal propagation) to be more specific (e.g., only filling `0`s).
3.  Establish a clear order of operations for these rules, paying attention to whether rules read from the original input or the current state of the output grid.
4.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the complete, ordered set of rules.

Requires Rule 5 (Horizontal `3` propagation - error at `(9,2)`). The other errors were fixed by implementing Rule 2 correctly. |
| train_3   | 12x12      | 12x12       | False           | 14                   | False           | 4                    | Requires Rule 3 (`4-Alone` -> `6` fill below). Requires Rule 4 (Vertical `1` prop). Requires Rule 5 (Horizontal `1` & `6` prop, only fill `0`s). Requires Rule 6 (Cleanup `6`->`0`). Errors at `(0,10)`, `(1,10)`, `(2,1)`, `(3,10)`. |

*Note: "Code v1" refers to the code from the previous step (derived only from train_1). "Code v2" refers to the second code attempt incorporating rules from train_2 and train_3.*
*The pixel counts for Code v2 indicate improvement but show that the horizontal propagation for color 3 and the cleanup rule for color 6 are still missing or incorrect.*

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create a working copy (`output_grid`) of the `input_grid`.
    *   Keep the original `input_grid` for context checks.
    *   Create a set `processed_fours` to store `(r, c)` coordinates of '4's handled by the 4-7 rule.
2.  **Apply Red Boundary Transformation (Rule 1):**
    *   Iterate through each row `r` of the `input_grid`.
    *   Find all pairs of column indices `(c1, c2)` where `input_grid[r][c1] == 2` and `input_grid[r][c2] == 2` (`c1 < c2`).
    *   For each pair:
        *   Check if any cell in `input_grid[r][c1+1 : c2]` is `0`. Store result as `found_zero`.
        *   Set `output_grid[r][c1] = 3` and `output_grid[r][c2] = 3`.
        *   Fill `output_grid[r][c1+1 : c2]` with `3`.
        *   Determine the marker position: `pos = c1 + 2` if `found_zero`, else `pos = c2 - 1`.
        *   If `c1 < pos < c2`, set `output_grid[r][pos] = 1`.
3.  **Apply 4-7 Transformation (Rule 2):**
    *   Iterate through cells `(r, c)` from `r=0` to `height-1` and `c=0` to `width-2`.
    *   If `input_grid[r][c] == 4` and `input_grid[r][c+1] == 7`:
        *   If `r + 1 < height`, copy the segment `input_grid[r+1][0:c]` to `output_grid[r][0:c]`.
        *   Replace cells in `output_grid[r]` starting at index `c` with `3`s for up to 4 positions (i.e., `c`, `c+1`, `c+2`, `c+3`), stopping at the grid boundary (`width-1`).
        *   Add `(r, c)` to `processed_fours`.
4.  **Apply 4-Alone Transformation (Rule 3):**
    *   Iterate through cells `(r, c)` from `r=0` to `height-1` and `c=0` to `width-1`.
    *   If `input_grid[r][c] == 4` AND `(r, c)` is NOT in `processed_fours`:
        *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 6`.
        *   For each row `i` from `r + 1` to `height - 1`:
            *   Set `output_grid[i][c] = 6`.
5.  **Apply Vertical 1 Propagation (Rule 4):**
    *   Iterate through cells `(r, c)` from `r=1` to `height-2` and `c=0` to `width-1`.
    *   Check the **original** `input_grid`: If `input_grid[r-1][c] == 1` AND `input_grid[r+1][c] == 1` AND `input_grid[r][c] == 0`:
        *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 1`.
6.  **Apply Horizontal Propagation (Rule 5):**
    *   Iterate through each row `r` of the `output_grid`.
    *   Start a loop that continues as long as changes are made within the row in a full pass:
        *   Set `change_made_this_pass = false`.
        *   Create a temporary copy of the current `output_grid[r]` (`temp_row`).
        *   Iterate through each column `c` from `1` to `width - 2`:
            *   If `output_grid[r][c] == 0`: # Only fill zeros
                *   If `temp_row[c-1] == 1` and `temp_row[c+1] == 1`:
                    *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 1`. Set `change_made_this_pass = true`.
                *   Else If `temp_row[c-1] == 3` and `temp_row[c+1] == 3`:
                    *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 3`. Set `change_made_this_pass = true`.
                *   Else If `temp_row[c-1] == 6` and `temp_row[c+1] == 6`:
                    *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 6`. Set `change_made_this_pass = true`.
        *   If `change_made_this_pass` is false, break the loop for this row.
7.  **Apply Cleanup for `0 1 ... 6` pattern (Rule 6):**
    *   Iterate through each row `r` of the `output_grid`.
    *   Assuming grid width is 12: If `output_grid[r][0] == 0` AND `output_grid[r][1] == 1` AND `output_grid[r][10] == 6`:
        *   Set `output_grid[r][10] = 0`.
8.  **Final Output:** Return the `output_grid`.
