            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code, derived solely from `train_1`, correctly handled the Red Boundary (`2...2`) and basic Blue Propagation (`1...1`) rules. However, it failed on `train_2` and `train_3`, indicating the presence of additional rules triggered by other colors and patterns.\n\n*   **`train_2` Failure:** The code missed the `4-7` transformation rule, which involves copying a segment from the row below and filling with color `3`. It also seems to have missed a horizontal propagation rule for color `3`.\n*   **`train_3` Failure:** The code missed the `4-Alone` transformation rule, which involves changing the `4` to `6` and propagating `6` vertically downwards. It also didn't correctly handle the interaction between horizontal propagation (specifically for color `6`) and vertical propagation (for color `1`), and missed a cleanup rule affecting `6`s in specific rows.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Incorporate the specific rules observed in `train_2` (`4-7` transform, horizontal `3` propagation) and `train_3` (`4-Alone` transform, vertical `1` propagation refinement, horizontal `6` propagation refinement, final cleanup rule).\n2.  Refine the existing rules (like horizontal propagation) to be more specific (e.g., only filling `0`s).\n3.  Establish a clear order of operations for these rules, paying attention to whether rules read from the original input or the current state of the output grid.\n4.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the complete, ordered set of rules.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example   | Input Size | Output Size | Match (Code v1) | Pixels Off (Code v1) | Match (Code v2) | Pixels Off (Code v2) | Notes (Differences & Key Features Required)                                                                                                                               |\n| :-------- | :--------- | :---------- | :-------------- | :------------------- | :-------------- | :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| train_1   | 12x12      | 12x12       | True            | 0                    | True            | 0                    | Requires Rule 1 (`2...2` -> `3` fill, `1` marker) & Rule 5 (Horizontal `1` propagation).                                                                               |\n| train_2   | 12x12      | 12x12       | False           | 14                   | False           | 4                    | Requires Rule 2 (`4-7` -> copy below, fill `3`). Requires Rule 5 (Horizontal `3` propagation - error at `(9,2)`).

Requires Rule 4 (Vertical `1` prop). Requires Rule 5 (Horizontal `1` & `6` prop, only fill `0`s). Requires Rule 6 (Cleanup `6`->`0`). Errors at `(0,10)`, `(1,10)`, `(2,1)`, `(3,10)`. |\n\n*Note: \"Code v1\" refers to the code from the previous step (derived only from train_1). \"Code v2\" refers to the second code attempt incorporating rules from train_2 and train_3.*\n*The pixel counts for Code v2 indicate improvement but show that the horizontal propagation for color 3 and the cleanup rule for color 6 are still missing or incorrect.*\n\n## YAML Facts Documentation\n\n```yaml\nGrid:\n  type: object\n  properties:\n    size: 12x12 (consistent across examples)\n    cells: list of lists of integers (colors)\n\nColors:\n  - 0: Black (Background/Empty - fillable by propagation)\n  - 1: Blue (Subject to vertical and horizontal propagation)\n  - 2: Red (Boundary marker for Rule 1)\n  - 3: Green (Fill color for Rule 1 & 2, subject to horizontal propagation)\n  - 4: Magenta (Trigger for Rule 2 and Rule 3)\n  - 6: Cyan (Fill color for Rule 3, subject to horizontal propagation, potential target for cleanup)\n  - 7: Orange (Secondary trigger/boundary for Rule 2)\n\nTriggers_and_Patterns:\n  - Red_Boundaries: A pair of '2's on the same row in the input grid.\n  - Four_Seven: A '4' immediately followed by a '7' on the same row in the input grid.\n  - Four_Alone: A '4' in the input grid NOT immediately followed by a '7', and not processed by Four_Seven rule.\n  - Vertical_Gap_1_Input: A '0' cell in the input grid vertically between two '1's in the input grid.\n  - Horizontal_Gap_0: A '0' cell in the working grid horizontally between two identical non-zero colors (1, 3, or 6).\n  - Cleanup_Pattern_Row_Start: Row in the working grid starts with '0 1'.\n  - Cleanup_Pattern_Cell: A '6' cell at column index 10 (width-2) in a row matching Cleanup_Pattern_Row_Start.\n\nActions:\n  - Modify_Boundary_Color: Change cell color (e.g., 2 -> 3).\n  - Fill_Horizontal_Segment: Change colors of cells between two columns on a row (e.g., fill with 3).\n  - Place_Marker: Change a single cell's color based on context (e.g., place 1 within a 3-filled segment).\n  - Copy_Row_Segment: Replace a segment of a row with the corresponding segment from the row below (based on input grid).\n  - Fill_Pattern: Replace a specific pattern with another (e.g., '4 7 ...' -> '3 3 3 3').\n  - Fill_Column_Segment_Vertically: Change colors of cells in a column from a trigger cell downwards (e.g., fill with 6).\n  - Fill_Zero_Gap_Horizontally: Change a '0' cell's color based on its identical horizontal neighbors (iterative).\n  - Fill_Zero_Gap_Vertically: Change a '0' cell's color based on its vertical neighbors (using input grid context).\n  - Clear_Cell: Change a cell's color to '0'.\n\nRules_and_Order: (Applied sequentially)\n  - 1_Red_Boundary_Transform:\n      - trigger: Red_Boundaries (c1, c2) found in input[r].\n      - context: Check if input[r][c1+1:c2] contains 0.\n      - action: Modify output[r]: output[r][c1]=3, output[r][c2]=3, output[r][c1+1:c2]=3.
