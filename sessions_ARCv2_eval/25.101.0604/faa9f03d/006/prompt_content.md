```python
import copy

"""
Transforms an input grid based on a sequence of rules applied using both the
original input grid for context and modifying a working copy:

1.  **Red Boundary Transformation (Rule 1):** Reads input grid. Identifies '2' pairs on rows.
    Changes boundaries to '3', fills segment with '3', places '1' marker
    (position depends on original '0' presence) in the working grid.
2.  **4-7 Transformation (Rule 2):** Reads input grid. Finds '4' followed by '7'.
    Copies segment from row below (input) into working grid row. Fills '4', '7',
    and next cells with '3's in working grid. Marks '4' as processed.
3.  **4-Alone Transformation (Rule 3):** Reads input grid. Finds '4' not processed by Rule 2.
    Changes '4' to '6' in working grid, fills column below with '6's in working grid.
4.  **Vertical 1 Propagation (Rule 4):** Reads input grid. Finds '0' vertically between two '1's.
    Changes corresponding '0' to '1' in the working grid.
5.  **Horizontal Propagation (Rule 5):** Iteratively modifies working grid. Fills '0's
    horizontally between two identical non-zero neighbors (1, 3, or 6).
6.  **Cleanup Rule (Rule 6):** Reads working grid. If a row starts '0 1 ...' and has '6'
    at column 10, changes that '6' to '0'.
