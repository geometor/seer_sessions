## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code version successfully implemented the rules derived from analyzing all three examples individually (Red Boundary, 4-7, 4-Alone, Horizontal Prop, Vertical Prop). However, testing revealed discrepancies, indicating interactions between rules, incorrect rule logic, or missing rules.

**Key Findings from Errors:**

1.  **Example 1 Error (`(5, 4)`):** The horizontal propagation rule was too restrictive, only filling `0`s. It needs to overwrite existing colors (like the `3` at `(5,4)`) if they are situated between two `1`s.
2.  **Example 2 Errors (Row 4, Row 9):** The code missed vertical propagation rules. The patterns `7-0-7` and `3-0-3` in the *input* grid vertically should cause the `0` in the output grid to be filled with `7` and `3` respectively. The error at `(9,2)` indicates the horizontal propagation for `3` might have failed or interacted incorrectly, but fixing the rule as per point 1 should resolve this.
3.  **Example 3 Errors (Column 10):** The previously added "Cleanup Rule" (Rule 6) was incorrect. It wrongly zeroed out `6`s that should have remained. Removing this rule is necessary. Additionally, the horizontal propagation for `6` needs the same fix as for `1` (overwriting non-`6` colors). The order of Vertical 1 propagation relative to Horizontal propagation was also critical for cell `(2,6)`.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Horizontal Propagation (Rule 5):** Modify the rule to propagate color `X` (where X is 1, 3, or 6) into a cell `Y` if `Y` is between two `X`'s and `Y != X`. It should no longer be restricted to only filling `0`s.
2.  **Add Vertical Propagation (New Rule 5):** Introduce a rule that checks the *input* grid for vertical `X-0-X` patterns (where X is 3 or 7) and sets the corresponding cell in the *output* grid to `X`.
3.  **Adjust Rule Order:** Place all vertical propagation rules (existing `1-0-1` and new `3-0-3`, `7-0-7`) *before* the horizontal propagation rule.
4.  **Remove Incorrect Rule:** Delete the Cleanup Rule (former Rule 6).
5.  **Update Documentation:** Reflect these refined rules and their order in the YAML facts and natural language program.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create a working copy (`output_grid`) of the `input_grid`.
    *   Keep the original `input_grid` for context checks.
    *   Create a set `processed_fours` to store `(r, c)` coordinates of '4's handled by the 4-7 rule.
2.  **Apply Red Boundary Transformation (Rule 1):**
    *   Iterate through each row `r` of the `input_grid`.
    *   Find all pairs of column indices `(c1, c2)` where `input_grid[r][c1] == 2` and `input_grid[r][c2] == 2` (`c1 < c2`).
    *   For each pair:
        *   Check if any cell in `input_grid[r][c1+1 : c2]` is `0`. Store result as `found_zero`.
        *   Set `output_grid[r][c1] = 3` and `output_grid[r][c2] = 3`.
        *   Fill `output_grid[r][c1+1 : c2]` with `3`.
        *   Determine the marker position: `pos = c1 + 2` if `found_zero`, else `pos = c2 - 1`.
        *   If `c1 < pos < c2`, set `output_grid[r][pos] = 1`.
3.  **Apply 4-7 Transformation (Rule 2):**
    *   Iterate through cells `(r, c)` from `r=0` to `height-1` and `c=0` to `width-2`.
    *   If `input_grid[r][c] == 4` and `input_grid[r][c+1] == 7`:
        *   If `r + 1 < height`, copy the segment `input_grid[r+1][0:c]` to `output_grid[r][0:c]`.
        *   Replace cells in `output_grid[r]` starting at index `c` with `3`s for up to 4 positions (i.e., `c`, `c+1`, `c+2`, `c+3`), stopping at the grid boundary (`width-1`).
        *   Add `(r, c)` to `processed_fours`.
4.  **Apply 4-Alone Transformation (Rule 3):**
    *   Iterate through cells `(r, c)` from `r=0` to `height-1` and `c=0` to `width-1`.
    *   If `input_grid[r][c] == 4` AND `(r, c)` is NOT in `processed_fours`:
        *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 6`.
        *   For each row `i` from `r + 1` to `height - 1`:
            *   Set `output_grid[i][c] = 6`.
5.  **Apply Vertical Propagation (Rule 4):**
    *   Iterate through cells `(r, c)` from `r=1` to `height-2` and `c=0` to `width-1`.
    *   Check the **original** `input_grid`:
        *   If `input_grid[r-1][c] == 1` AND `input_grid[r+1][c] == 1` AND `input_grid[r][c] == 0`: Set `output_grid[r][c] = 1`.
        *   Else if `input_grid[r-1][c] == 3` AND `input_grid[r+1][c] == 3` AND `input_grid[r][c] == 0`: Set `output_grid[r][c] = 3`.
        *   Else if `input_grid[r-1][c] == 7` AND `input_grid[r+1][c] == 7` AND `input_grid[r][c] == 0`: Set `output_grid[r][c] = 7`.
6.  **Apply Horizontal Propagation (Rule 5):**
    *   Iterate through each row `r` of the `output_grid`.
    *   Start a loop that continues as long as changes are made within the row in a full pass:
        *   Set `change_made_this_pass = false`.
        *   Create a temporary copy of the current `output_grid[r]` (`temp_row`).
        *   Iterate through each column `c` from `1` to `width - 2`:
            *   Let `left_color = temp_row[c-1]` and `right_color = temp_row[c+1]`.
            *   Let `current_color = output_grid[r][c]`.
            *   If `left_color == right_color` AND `left_color != 0` AND `current_color != left_color`:
                *   If `left_color` is 1, 3, or 6:
                    *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = left_color`.
                    *   Set `change_made_this_pass = true`.
        *   If `change_made_this_pass` is false, break the loop for this row.
7.  **Final Output:** Return the `output_grid`.
