            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code, derived solely from `train_1`, successfully solved that specific example but failed on `train_2` and `train_3`. This confirms that the transformation logic is more complex and likely involves multiple, distinct rules triggered by different patterns or colors present in the input grids. The failures in `train_2` and `train_3` highlight rules involving colors `4`, `7`, and `6`, and different transformation mechanisms (row segment copying, vertical propagation) not present in `train_1`.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Analyze the specific transformations occurring in `train_2` and `train_3`.\n2.  Identify the trigger conditions (specific colors or patterns) and the corresponding actions for these examples.\n3.  Synthesize a combined set of rules that accounts for the behavior observed across all three examples.\n4.  Determine the correct order of application for these rules, as some might conflict or depend on the state left by others. The analysis suggests the following rules and a potential order:\n    *   Red Boundary Transformation (`2...2` -> fill `3`, place `1`)\n    *   4-7 Trigger (`4` followed by `7` -> copy segment from row below, fill `3`s)\n    *   4 Trigger (standalone `4` -> vertical `6`s below)\n    *   Horizontal Propagation (fill gaps between `1`s with `1`, fill gaps between `6`s with `6`)\n    *   Vertical 1 Propagation (fill `0` with `1` if vertically between two `1`s)\n5.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect this comprehensive, ordered set of rules.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example   | Input Size | Output Size | Match (Initial Code) | Pixels Off (Initial Code) | Notes (Differences & Key Features)                                                                                                                               |\n| :-------- | :--------- | :---------- | :--------------------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| train_1   | 12x12      | 12x12       | True                   | 0                           | Contains `2...2` boundaries, triggers fill with `3` and placement of `1`. Contains `1...1` gaps triggering horizontal `1` propagation. Code based on this worked. |\n| train_2   | 12x12      | 12x12       | False                  | 14                          | Contains `4` followed by `7` in row 2. Expected output shows row 2 modified based on row 3, and a `3 3 3 3` pattern replacing `4 7 0 ...`. No `2`s present.      |\n| train_3   | 12x12      | 12x12       | False                  | 14                          | Contains `4` in row 3, column 10. Expected output shows column 10 filled with `6`s below row 3. Contains horizontal gaps between `1`s and `6`s, and a vertical `1-0-1` pattern, triggering fills. No `2`s present. |\n\n## YAML Facts Documentation\n\n```yaml\nGrid:\n  type: object\n  properties:\n    size: 12x12 (consistent across examples)\n    cells: list of lists of integers (colors)\n\nColors:\n  - 0: Black (Background/Empty)\n  - 1: Blue\n  - 2: Red (Boundary marker for Rule 1)\n  - 3: Green (Fill color for Rule 1 and Rule 3)\n  - 4: Magenta (Trigger for Rule 3 and Rule 4)\n  - 6: Cyan (Fill color for Rule 4, also subject to propagation)\n  - 7: Orange (Secondary trigger/boundary for Rule 3)\n\nTriggers_and_Patterns:\n  - Red_Boundaries: A pair of '2's on the same row in the input grid.\n  - Four_Seven: A '4' immediately followed by a '7' on the same row in the input grid.\n  - Four_Alone: A '4' in the input grid NOT immediately followed by a '7'.\n  - Horizontal_Gap_1: A non-'1' cell horizontally between two '1's.\n  - Horizontal_Gap_6: A non-'6' cell horizontally between two '6's.\n  - Vertical_Gap_1: A '0' cell vertically between two '1's (based on input grid).\n\nActions:\n  - Modify_Boundary_Color: Change cell color (e.g., 2 -> 3).\n  - Fill_Horizontal_Segment: Change colors of cells between two columns on a row (e.g., fill with 3).\n  - Place_Marker: Change a single cell's color based on context (e.g., place 1 within a 3-filled segment).\n  - Copy_Row_Segment: Replace a segment of a row with the corresponding segment from the row below (based on input grid).\n  - Fill_Pattern: Replace a specific pattern with another (e.g., '4 7 0' -> '3 3 3 3').\n  - Fill_Column_Segment_Vertically: Change colors of cells in a column below a trigger cell (e.g., fill with 6).\n  - Propagate_Horizontally: Fill gaps based on horizontal neighbors (iterative).\n  - Propagate_Vertically: Fill a cell based on vertical neighbors (based on input grid).\n\nRules_and_Order:\n  - rule_priority: Rules are checked and applied in a specific order.

Mark this '4' as processed.\n  - 3_Four_Alone_Transform:\n      - trigger: Four_Alone pattern at input[r][c] (i.e., input[r][c]==4 and input[r][c+1]!=7, and not processed by rule 2).\n      - action: Modify output grid: For i from r+1 to height-1, set output[i][c] = 6.\n  - 4_Horizontal_Propagation:\n      - trigger: Horizontal_Gap_1 or Horizontal_Gap_6 in the current output grid.\n      - action: Modify output grid: Fill gap with 1 or 6 respectively.

(Applied after horizontal propagation).\n```\n\n## Natural Language Program\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Create a working copy (`output_grid`) of the `input_grid`. Keep the original `input_grid` for context checks. Create a mechanism (e.g., a set of coordinates) to track which '4' cells have been processed by the '4-7' rule.\n2.  **Apply Red Boundary Transformation:**\n    *   Iterate through each row `r` of the `input_grid`.\n    *   Find all pairs of indices `(c1, c2)` where `input_grid[r][c1] == 2` and `input_grid[r][c2] == 2` (`c1 < c2`).\n    *   For each pair:\n        *   Check if any cell in `input_grid[r][c1+1 : c2]` is `0`.\n        *   Set `output_grid[r][c1] = 3` and `output_grid[r][c2] = 3`.\n        *   Fill `output_grid[r][c1+1 : c2]` with `3`.\n        *   Determine the marker position: `pos = c1 + 2` if `0` was found, else `pos = c2 - 1`.\n        *   If `c1 < pos < c2`, set `output_grid[r][pos] = 1`.\n3.  **Apply 4-7 Transformation:**\n    *   Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` from `r=0` to `height-1` and `c=0` to `width-2`.\n    *   If `input_grid[r][c] == 4` and `input_grid[r][c+1] == 7`:\n        *   Copy the segment `input_grid[r+1][0:c]` to `output_grid[r][0:c]` (handle row `height-1` case if necessary, though examples don't show it).\n        *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 3`.\n        *   Set `output_grid[r][c+1] = 3`.\n        *   Set `output_grid[r][c+2] = 3` (if `c+2 < width`).\n        *   Set `output_grid[r][c+3] = 3` (if `c+3 < width`).\n        *   Mark the cell `(r, c)` as processed (to prevent Rule 4 from applying to this '4').\n4.  **Apply 4-Alone Transformation:**\n    *   Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` from `r=0` to `height-1` and `c=0` to `width-1`.\n    *   If `input_grid[r][c] == 4` AND the cell `(r, c)` was *not* marked as processed in the previous step:\n        *   For each row `i` from `r + 1` to `height - 1`:\n            *   Set `output_grid[i][c] = 6`.\n5.  **Apply Horizontal Propagation:**\n    *   Iterate through each row `r` of the `output_grid`.\n    *   Start a loop that continues as long as changes are made within the row in a full pass:\n        *   Set `change_made_this_pass = false`.\n        *   Create a temporary copy of the current `output_grid[r]`.\n        *   Iterate through each column `c` from `1` to `width - 2`:\n            *   If `temp_row[c-1] == 1` and `temp_row[c+1] == 1` and `output_grid[r][c] != 1`:\n                *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 1`.\n                *   Set `change_made_this_pass = true`.\n            *   Else if `temp_row[c-1] == 6` and `temp_row[c+1] == 6` and `output_grid[r][c] != 6`:\n                *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 6`.\n                *   Set `change_made_this_pass = true`.\n        *   If `change_made_this_pass` is false, break the loop for this row.\n6.  **Apply Vertical 1 Propagation:**\n    *   Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` from `r=1` to `height-2` and `c=0` to `width-1`.\n    *   Check the original `input_grid`: If `input_grid[r-1][c] == 1` AND `input_grid[r+1][c] == 1` AND `input_grid[r][c] == 0`:\n        *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 1`. (This might overwrite a value placed by horizontal propagation, which is intended based on `train_3`).\n7.  **Final Output:** Return the `output_grid`."
