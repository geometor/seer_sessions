Grid:
  type: object
  properties:
    size: 12x12
    cells: list of lists of integers (colors)

Colors:
  - 0: Black (Background/Empty)
  - 1: Blue
  - 2: Red (Boundary marker)
  - 3: Green (Fill color)
  - (Other colors 4, 6, 7 appear in other examples but their role in the primary transformation derived from train_1 is secondary or undefined)

Objects:
  - Horizontal Segment: A sequence of cells in a single row.
    properties:
      - boundary_left: Cell defining the start (e.g., color 2, or grid edge/0)
      - boundary_right: Cell defining the end (e.g., color 2, or grid edge/0)
      - content: Sequence of cells between boundaries
      - contains_zero: boolean indicating if any cell within the content was originally 0

Actions:
  - Find Red Boundary Pairs: Identify pairs of cells with color 2 on the same row.
  - Fill Segment: Change the color of cells within a segment to a specified color (e.g., 3).
  - Modify Boundaries: Change the color of boundary cells (e.g., 2 -> 3).
  - Place Marker: Change a specific cell within a filled segment to a different color (e.g., 1).
  - Propagate Color Horizontally: Change cells between two cells of the same color (e.g., 1) to that color.

Relationships/Rules:
  - Rule_Red_Boundary:
    - trigger: Pair of color 2 cells (c1, c2) on a row `r`.
    - action_1: Change cells (r, c1) and (r, c2) to color 3.
    - action_2: Fill cells (r, c) for c1 < c < c2 with color 3.
    - action_3: Determine marker position:
      - if original segment content (c1 < c < c2) contained 0: marker_pos = c1 + 2
      - else: marker_pos = c2 - 1
    - action_4: Change cell (r, marker_pos) to color 1.
  - Rule_Blue_Propagation:
    - trigger: A cell (r, c) is not color 1, but its horizontal neighbors (r, c-1) and (r, c+1) are both color 1.
    - action: Change cell (r, c) to color 1.
    - condition: Apply iteratively/repeatedly until no more changes occur in the row.
  - Order: Rule_Red_Boundary is applied first across the grid, then Rule_Blue_Propagation is applied.
