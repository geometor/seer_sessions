            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\nBased on the examples, particularly `train_1`, the task seems to involve modifying horizontal patterns within a grid.\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are consistently 12x12 grids of colored cells (represented by integers).\n2.  **Colors:** Different colors (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7) appear, but specific transformations seem tied to particular colors acting as boundaries or fill patterns.\n3.  **Key Transformations (Train 1):**\n    *   **Red Boundaries (Color 2):** Pairs of color `2` on the same row define a segment. These boundaries are changed to color `3`. The content between them is filled with color `3`, except for one specific cell which is changed to color `1`. The position of this `1` appears dependent on whether a `0` was initially present within the segment.\n    *   **Blue Propagation (Color 1):** Color `1` seems to fill gaps (horizontally) between existing `1`s. Any cell (including `0` or other colors like `3`) located immediately between two `1`s in the same row is changed to `1`.\n4.  **Other Examples:** Trains 2 and 3 introduce other colors and potentially different rules (vertical propagation, row copying, specific column fills, horizontal fills with other colors like 3 and 6). However, the rules derived from Train 1 seem self-contained and consistently applied there. The task might focus specifically on the interactions observed with colors 1, 2, and 3 as seen in Train 1, or the examples might represent different modes or types of transformations applicable under different conditions not fully revealed. Given the instruction to find *the* transformation rule, I will focus on the clear rules from Train 1, assuming they represent the core task logic.\n5.  **Process:** The transformation appears to happen in distinct steps: first handling the red boundaries, then propagating the blue color.\n\n## YAML Facts Documentation\n\n```yaml\nGrid:\n  type: object\n  properties:\n    size: 12x12\n    cells: list of lists of integers (colors)\n\nColors:\n  - 0: Black (Background/Empty)\n  - 1: Blue\n  - 2: Red (Boundary marker)\n  - 3: Green (Fill color)\n  - (Other colors 4, 6, 7 appear in other examples but their role in the primary transformation derived from train_1 is secondary or undefined)\n\nObjects:\n  - Horizontal Segment: A sequence of cells in a single row.\n    properties:\n      - boundary_left: Cell defining the start (e.g., color 2, or grid edge/0)\n      - boundary_right: Cell defining the end (e.g., color 2, or grid edge/0)\n      - content: Sequence of cells between boundaries\n      - contains_zero: boolean indicating if any cell within the content was originally 0\n\nActions:\n  - Find Red Boundary Pairs: Identify pairs of cells with color 2 on the same row.\n  - Fill Segment: Change the color of cells within a segment to a specified color (e.g., 3).\n  - Modify Boundaries: Change the color of boundary cells (e.g., 2 -> 3).\n  - Place Marker: Change a specific cell within a filled segment to a different color (e.g., 1).\n  - Propagate Color Horizontally: Change cells between two cells of the same color (e.g., 1) to that color.\n\nRelationships/Rules:\n  - Rule_Red_Boundary:\n    - trigger: Pair of color 2 cells (c1, c2) on a row `r`.\n    - action_1: Change cells (r, c1) and (r, c2) to color 3.\n    - action_2: Fill cells (r, c) for c1 < c < c2 with color 3.\n    - action_3: Determine marker position:\n      - if original segment content (c1 < c < c2) contained 0: marker_pos = c1 + 2\n      - else: marker_pos = c2 - 1\n    - action_4: Change cell (r, marker_pos) to color 1.\n  - Rule_Blue_Propagation:\n    - trigger: A cell (r, c) is not color 1, but its horizontal neighbors (r, c-1) and (r, c+1) are both color 1.\n    - action: Change cell (r, c) to color 1.\n    - condition: Apply iteratively/repeatedly until no more changes occur in the row.\n  - Order: Rule_Red_Boundary is applied first across the grid, then Rule_Blue_Propagation is applied.\n```\n\n## Natural Language Program\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Create a working copy of the input grid.\n2.  **Red Boundary Transformation Pass:**\n    *   For each row `r` from top to bottom in the grid:\n        *   Find all pairs of column indices `(c1, c2)` such that `c1 < c2`, the input grid at `(r, c1)` is `2`, and the input grid at `(r, c2)` is `2`. Process these pairs (if multiple pairs exist, assume they don't overlap based on examples).\n        *   For each found pair `(c1, c2)`:\n            *   Determine if any cell in the input grid at `(r, c)` for `c` between `c1 + 1` and `c2 - 1` (inclusive) has the color `0`. Store this boolean result (e.g., `found_zero`).\n            *   In the working grid copy, change the color of cells `(r, c1)` and `(r, c2)` to `3`.\n            *   In the working grid copy, change the color of all cells `(r, c)` for `c` between `c1 + 1` and `c2 - 1` (inclusive) to `3`.\n            *   If `found_zero` is true, change the color of the cell at `(r, c1 + 2)` in the working grid copy to `1`.\n            *   If `found_zero` is false, change the color of the cell at `(r, c2 - 1)` in the working grid copy to `1`.\n3.  **Blue Propagation Pass:**\n    *   For each row `r` from top to bottom in the working grid copy:\n        *   Repeatedly scan the row until no changes are made in a full scan:\n            *   Set a flag `change_made_in_scan` to false.\n            *   For each column `c` from `1` to `width - 2`:\n                *   If the cell `(r, c)` is *not* color `1`, AND the cell `(r, c-1)` is color `1`, AND the cell `(r, c+1)` is color `1`:\n                    *   Change the color of cell `(r, c)` to `1`.\n                    *   Set `change_made_in_scan` to true.\n            *   If `change_made_in_scan` is false after scanning the entire row, exit the repetition for this row.\n4.  **Final Output:** Return the modified working grid copy."
