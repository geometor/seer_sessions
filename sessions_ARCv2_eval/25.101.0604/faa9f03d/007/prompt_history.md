Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

## Perception of Elements

Based on the examples, particularly `train_1`, the task seems to involve modifying horizontal patterns within a grid.

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are consistently 12x12 grids of colored cells (represented by integers).
2.  **Colors:** Different colors (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7) appear, but specific transformations seem tied to particular colors acting as boundaries or fill patterns.
3.  **Key Transformations (Train 1):**
    *   **Red Boundaries (Color 2):** Pairs of color `2` on the same row define a segment. These boundaries are changed to color `3`. The content between them is filled with color `3`, except for one specific cell which is changed to color `1`. The position of this `1` appears dependent on whether a `0` was initially present within the segment.
    *   **Blue Propagation (Color 1):** Color `1` seems to fill gaps (horizontally) between existing `1`s. Any cell (including `0` or other colors like `3`) located immediately between two `1`s in the same row is changed to `1`.
4.  **Other Examples:** Trains 2 and 3 introduce other colors and potentially different rules (vertical propagation, row copying, specific column fills, horizontal fills with other colors like 3 and 6). However, the rules derived from Train 1 seem self-contained and consistently applied there. The task might focus specifically on the interactions observed with colors 1, 2, and 3 as seen in Train 1, or the examples might represent different modes or types of transformations applicable under different conditions not fully revealed. Given the instruction to find *the* transformation rule, I will focus on the clear rules from Train 1, assuming they represent the core task logic.
5.  **Process:** The transformation appears to happen in distinct steps: first handling the red boundaries, then propagating the blue color.

## YAML Facts Documentation

```yaml
Grid:
  type: object
  properties:
    size: 12x12
    cells: list of lists of integers (colors)

Colors:
  - 0: Black (Background/Empty)
  - 1: Blue
  - 2: Red (Boundary marker)
  - 3: Green (Fill color)
  - (Other colors 4, 6, 7 appear in other examples but their role in the primary transformation derived from train_1 is secondary or undefined)

Objects:
  - Horizontal Segment: A sequence of cells in a single row.
    properties:
      - boundary_left: Cell defining the start (e.g., color 2, or grid edge/0)
      - boundary_right: Cell defining the end (e.g., color 2, or grid edge/0)
      - content: Sequence of cells between boundaries
      - contains_zero: boolean indicating if any cell within the content was originally 0

Actions:
  - Find Red Boundary Pairs: Identify pairs of cells with color 2 on the same row.
  - Fill Segment: Change the color of cells within a segment to a specified color (e.g., 3).
  - Modify Boundaries: Change the color of boundary cells (e.g., 2 -> 3).
  - Place Marker: Change a specific cell within a filled segment to a different color (e.g., 1).
  - Propagate Color Horizontally: Change cells between two cells of the same color (e.g., 1) to that color.

Relationships/Rules:
  - Rule_Red_Boundary:
    - trigger: Pair of color 2 cells (c1, c2) on a row `r`.
    - action_1: Change cells (r, c1) and (r, c2) to color 3.
    - action_2: Fill cells (r, c) for c1 < c < c2 with color 3.
    - action_3: Determine marker position:
      - if original segment content (c1 < c < c2) contained 0: marker_pos = c1 + 2
      - else: marker_pos = c2 - 1
    - action_4: Change cell (r, marker_pos) to color 1.
  - Rule_Blue_Propagation:
    - trigger: A cell (r, c) is not color 1, but its horizontal neighbors (r, c-1) and (r, c+1) are both color 1.
    - action: Change cell (r, c) to color 1.
    - condition: Apply iteratively/repeatedly until no more changes occur in the row.
  - Order: Rule_Red_Boundary is applied first across the grid, then Rule_Blue_Propagation is applied.
```

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialization:** Create a working copy of the input grid.
2.  **Red Boundary Transformation Pass:**
    *   For each row `r` from top to bottom in the grid:
        *   Find all pairs of column indices `(c1, c2)` such that `c1 < c2`, the input grid at `(r, c1)` is `2`, and the input grid at `(r, c2)` is `2`. Process these pairs (if multiple pairs exist, assume they don't overlap based on examples).
        *   For each found pair `(c1, c2)`:
            *   Determine if any cell in the input grid at `(r, c)` for `c` between `c1 + 1` and `c2 - 1` (inclusive) has the color `0`. Store this boolean result (e.g., `found_zero`).
            *   In the working grid copy, change the color of cells `(r, c1)` and `(r, c2)` to `3`.
            *   In the working grid copy, change the color of all cells `(r, c)` for `c` between `c1 + 1` and `c2 - 1` (inclusive) to `3`.
            *   If `found_zero` is true, change the color of the cell at `(r, c1 + 2)` in the working grid copy to `1`.
            *   If `found_zero` is false, change the color of the cell at `(r, c2 - 1)` in the working grid copy to `1`.
3.  **Blue Propagation Pass:**
    *   For each row `r` from top to bottom in the working grid copy:
        *   Repeatedly scan the row until no changes are made in a full scan:
            *   Set a flag `change_made_in_scan` to false.
            *   For each column `c` from `1` to `width - 2`:
                *   If the cell `(r, c)` is *not* color `1`, AND the cell `(r, c-1)` is color `1`, AND the cell `(r, c+1)` is color `1`:
                    *   Change the color of cell `(r, c)` to `1`.
                    *   Set `change_made_in_scan` to true.
            *   If `change_made_in_scan` is false after scanning the entire row, exit the repetition for this row.
4.  **Final Output:** Return the modified working grid copy.

"""
Transforms an input grid based on two primary rules applied sequentially:

1.  **Red Boundary Transformation:** Identifies horizontal segments defined by pairs of '2's (red) on the same row in the original input. 
    - The boundary '2's are changed to '3's (green).
    - The cells between the boundaries are filled with '3's.
    - A single '1' (blue) is placed within the segment. Its position depends on whether a '0' (black) was originally present between the boundaries:
        - If a '0' was present, the '1' is placed at column `c1 + 2` (where `c1` is the left boundary column).
        - If no '0' was present, the '1' is placed at column `c2 - 1` (where `c2` is the right boundary column).
    This transformation uses the original input grid to determine the segments and the presence of '0's, but applies changes to a working copy.

2.  **Blue Propagation:** Iteratively fills horizontal gaps between '1's. 
    - If a cell is not '1', but its immediate left and right neighbors in the same row are '1', the cell is changed to '1'.
    - This process repeats for each row until no more cells can be changed in that row.
    This transformation operates on the grid resulting from the Red Boundary Transformation pass.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code, derived solely from `train_1`, successfully solved that specific example but failed on `train_2` and `train_3`. This confirms that the transformation logic is more complex and likely involves multiple, distinct rules triggered by different patterns or colors present in the input grids. The failures in `train_2` and `train_3` highlight rules involving colors `4`, `7`, and `6`, and different transformation mechanisms (row segment copying, vertical propagation) not present in `train_1`.

The strategy is to:
1.  Analyze the specific transformations occurring in `train_2` and `train_3`.
2.  Identify the trigger conditions (specific colors or patterns) and the corresponding actions for these examples.
3.  Synthesize a combined set of rules that accounts for the behavior observed across all three examples.
4.  Determine the correct order of application for these rules, as some might conflict or depend on the state left by others. The analysis suggests the following rules and a potential order:
    *   Red Boundary Transformation (`2...2` -> fill `3`, place `1`)
    *   4-7 Trigger (`4` followed by `7` -> copy segment from row below, fill `3`s)
    *   4 Trigger (standalone `4` -> vertical `6`s below)
    *   Horizontal Propagation (fill gaps between `1`s with `1`, fill gaps between `6`s with `6`)
    *   Vertical 1 Propagation (fill `0` with `1` if vertically between two `1`s)
5.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect this comprehensive, ordered set of rules.

| train_3   | 12x12      | 12x12       | False                  | 14                          | Contains `4` in row 3, column 10. Expected output shows column 10 filled with `6`s below row 3. Contains horizontal gaps between `1`s and `6`s, and a vertical `1-0-1` pattern, triggering fills. No `2`s present. |

## YAML Facts Documentation

```yaml
Grid:
  type: object
  properties:
    size: 12x12 (consistent across examples)
    cells: list of lists of integers (colors)

Colors:
  - 0: Black (Background/Empty)
  - 1: Blue
  - 2: Red (Boundary marker for Rule 1)
  - 3: Green (Fill color for Rule 1 and Rule 3)
  - 4: Magenta (Trigger for Rule 3 and Rule 4)
  - 6: Cyan (Fill color for Rule 4, also subject to propagation)
  - 7: Orange (Secondary trigger/boundary for Rule 3)

Triggers_and_Patterns:
  - Red_Boundaries: A pair of '2's on the same row in the input grid.
  - Four_Seven: A '4' immediately followed by a '7' on the same row in the input grid.
  - Four_Alone: A '4' in the input grid NOT immediately followed by a '7'.
  - Horizontal_Gap_1: A non-'1' cell horizontally between two '1's.
  - Horizontal_Gap_6: A non-'6' cell horizontally between two '6's.
  - Vertical_Gap_1: A '0' cell vertically between two '1's (based on input grid).

Actions:
  - Modify_Boundary_Color: Change cell color (e.g., 2 -> 3).
  - Fill_Horizontal_Segment: Change colors of cells between two columns on a row (e.g., fill with 3).
  - Place_Marker: Change a single cell's color based on context (e.g., place 1 within a 3-filled segment).
  - Copy_Row_Segment: Replace a segment of a row with the corresponding segment from the row below (based on input grid).
  - Fill_Pattern: Replace a specific pattern with another (e.g., '4 7 0' -> '3 3 3 3').
  - Fill_Column_Segment_Vertically: Change colors of cells in a column below a trigger cell (e.g., fill with 6).
  - Propagate_Horizontally: Fill gaps based on horizontal neighbors (iterative).
  - Propagate_Vertically: Fill a cell based on vertical neighbors (based on input grid).

Rules_and_Order:
  - rule_priority: Rules are checked and applied in a specific order. Actions modify a working copy of the grid. Some rules read context from the original input grid.
  - 1_Red_Boundary_Transform:
      - trigger: Red_Boundaries (c1, c2) found in input[r].
      - context: Check if input[r][c1+1:c2] contains 0.
      - action: Modify output[r]: output[r][c1]=3, output[r][c2]=3, output[r][c1+1:c2]=3. Place '1' at output[r][c1+2] if 0 was found, else at output[r][c2-1].
  - 2_Four_Seven_Transform:
      - trigger: Four_Seven pattern at input[r][c] and input[r][c+1].
      - action: Modify output[r]: Replace output[r][0:c] with input[r+1][0:c]. Replace output[r][c:c+4] (or fewer if hitting boundary) with [3, 3, 3, 3]. Mark this '4' as processed.
  - 3_Four_Alone_Transform:
      - trigger: Four_Alone pattern at input[r][c] (i.e., input[r][c]==4 and input[r][c+1]!=7, and not processed by rule 2).
      - action: Modify output grid: For i from r+1 to height-1, set output[i][c] = 6.
  - 4_Horizontal_Propagation:
      - trigger: Horizontal_Gap_1 or Horizontal_Gap_6 in the current output grid.
      - action: Modify output grid: Fill gap with 1 or 6 respectively. Apply iteratively per row until no changes.
  - 5_Vertical_1_Propagation:
      - trigger: Vertical_Gap_1 (check input[r-1][c]==1, input[r+1][c]==1, input[r][c]==0).
      - action: Modify output grid: Set output[r][c] = 1. (Applied after horizontal propagation).

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialization:** Create a working copy (`output_grid`) of the `input_grid`. Keep the original `input_grid` for context checks. Create a mechanism (e.g., a set of coordinates) to track which '4' cells have been processed by the '4-7' rule.
2.  **Apply Red Boundary Transformation:**
    *   Iterate through each row `r` of the `input_grid`.
    *   Find all pairs of indices `(c1, c2)` where `input_grid[r][c1] == 2` and `input_grid[r][c2] == 2` (`c1 < c2`).
    *   For each pair:
        *   Check if any cell in `input_grid[r][c1+1 : c2]` is `0`.
        *   Set `output_grid[r][c1] = 3` and `output_grid[r][c2] = 3`.
        *   Fill `output_grid[r][c1+1 : c2]` with `3`.
        *   Determine the marker position: `pos = c1 + 2` if `0` was found, else `pos = c2 - 1`.
        *   If `c1 < pos < c2`, set `output_grid[r][pos] = 1`.
3.  **Apply 4-7 Transformation:**
    *   Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` from `r=0` to `height-1` and `c=0` to `width-2`.
    *   If `input_grid[r][c] == 4` and `input_grid[r][c+1] == 7`:
        *   Copy the segment `input_grid[r+1][0:c]` to `output_grid[r][0:c]` (handle row `height-1` case if necessary, though examples don't show it).
        *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 3`.
        *   Set `output_grid[r][c+1] = 3`.
        *   Set `output_grid[r][c+2] = 3` (if `c+2 < width`).
        *   Set `output_grid[r][c+3] = 3` (if `c+3 < width`).
        *   Mark the cell `(r, c)` as processed (to prevent Rule 4 from applying to this '4').
4.  **Apply 4-Alone Transformation:**
    *   Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` from `r=0` to `height-1` and `c=0` to `width-1`.
    *   If `input_grid[r][c] == 4` AND the cell `(r, c)` was *not* marked as processed in the previous step:
        *   For each row `i` from `r + 1` to `height - 1`:
            *   Set `output_grid[i][c] = 6`.
5.  **Apply Horizontal Propagation:**
    *   Iterate through each row `r` of the `output_grid`.
    *   Start a loop that continues as long as changes are made within the row in a full pass:
        *   Set `change_made_this_pass = false`.
        *   Create a temporary copy of the current `output_grid[r]`.
        *   Iterate through each column `c` from `1` to `width - 2`:
            *   If `temp_row[c-1] == 1` and `temp_row[c+1] == 1` and `output_grid[r][c] != 1`:
                *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 1`.
                *   Set `change_made_this_pass = true`.
            *   Else if `temp_row[c-1] == 6` and `temp_row[c+1] == 6` and `output_grid[r][c] != 6`:
                *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 6`.
                *   Set `change_made_this_pass = true`.
        *   If `change_made_this_pass` is false, break the loop for this row.
6.  **Apply Vertical 1 Propagation:**
    *   Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` from `r=1` to `height-2` and `c=0` to `width-1`.
    *   Check the original `input_grid`: If `input_grid[r-1][c] == 1` AND `input_grid[r+1][c] == 1` AND `input_grid[r][c] == 0`:
        *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 1`. (This might overwrite a value placed by horizontal propagation, which is intended based on `train_3`).
7.  **Final Output:** Return the `output_grid`.
```python
import copy

"""
Transforms an input grid based on a sequence of rules applied iteratively or based on context from the original input grid:

1.  **Red Boundary Transformation (Rule 1):** Operates on the original input. Identifies horizontal segments defined by pairs of '2's. Changes boundaries to '3', fills the segment with '3', and places a '1' marker whose position depends on whether a '0' was originally present in the segment. Changes are applied to the working grid.

2.  **4-7 Transformation (Rule 2):** Operates on the original input. Looks for a '4' immediately followed by a '7'. If found at (r, c) and (r, c+1), it copies the segment from the row below (r+1) up to column c-1 into the current row r of the working grid. It then replaces the '4' and subsequent cells (up to 3 more) with '3's in the working grid. Marks the '4' as processed.

3.  **4-Alone Transformation (Rule 3):** Operates on the original input. Looks for a '4' that was *not* processed by Rule 2. If found at (r, c), it fills the column below it (from r+1 downwards) with '6's in the working grid.

4.  **Horizontal Propagation (Rule 4):** Operates iteratively on the working grid. Fills horizontal gaps: any non-'1' cell between two '1's becomes '1', and any non-'6' cell between two '6's becomes '6'. This repeats per row until no changes occur.

5.  **Vertical 1 Propagation (Rule 5):** Operates using the original input for context but modifies the working grid. If a '0' in the input grid is located vertically between two '1's, that cell in the working grid is changed to '1'. This happens after horizontal propagation.

Previous Code:
```python
import copy

"""
Transforms an input grid based on a sequence of rules applied iteratively or based on context from the original input grid:

1.  **Red Boundary Transformation (Rule 1):** Operates on the original input. Identifies horizontal segments defined by pairs of '2's. Changes boundaries to '3', fills the segment with '3', and places a '1' marker whose position depends on whether a '0' was originally present in the segment. Changes are applied to the working grid.

2.  **4-7 Transformation (Rule 2):** Operates on the original input. Looks for a '4' immediately followed by a '7'. If found at (r, c) and (r, c+1), it copies the segment from the row below (r+1) up to column c-1 into the current row r of the working grid. It then replaces the '4' and subsequent cells (up to 3 more) with '3's in the working grid. Marks the '4' as processed.

3.  **4-Alone Transformation (Rule 3):** Operates on the original input. Looks for a '4' that was *not* processed by Rule 2. If found at (r, c), it fills the column below it (from r+1 downwards) with '6's in the working grid.

4.  **Horizontal Propagation (Rule 4):** Operates iteratively on the working grid. Fills horizontal gaps: any non-'1' cell between two '1's becomes '1', and any non-'6' cell between two '6's becomes '6'. This repeats per row until no changes occur.

5.  **Vertical 1 Propagation (Rule 5):** Operates using the original input for context but modifies the working grid. If a '0' in the input grid is located vertically between two '1's, that cell in the working grid is changed to '1'. This happens after horizontal propagation.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code, derived solely from `train_1`, correctly handled the Red Boundary (`2...2`) and basic Blue Propagation (`1...1`) rules. However, it failed on `train_2` and `train_3`, indicating the presence of additional rules triggered by other colors and patterns.

*   **`train_2` Failure:** The code missed the `4-7` transformation rule, which involves copying a segment from the row below and filling with color `3`. It also seems to have missed a horizontal propagation rule for color `3`.
*   **`train_3` Failure:** The code missed the `4-Alone` transformation rule, which involves changing the `4` to `6` and propagating `6` vertically downwards. It also didn't correctly handle the interaction between horizontal propagation (specifically for color `6`) and vertical propagation (for color `1`), and missed a cleanup rule affecting `6`s in specific rows.

The strategy is to:
1.  Incorporate the specific rules observed in `train_2` (`4-7` transform, horizontal `3` propagation) and `train_3` (`4-Alone` transform, vertical `1` propagation refinement, horizontal `6` propagation refinement, final cleanup rule).
2.  Refine the existing rules (like horizontal propagation) to be more specific (e.g., only filling `0`s).
3.  Establish a clear order of operations for these rules, paying attention to whether rules read from the original input or the current state of the output grid.

Requires Rule 5 (Horizontal `3` propagation - error at `(9,2)`). The other errors were fixed by implementing Rule 2 correctly. |
| train_3   | 12x12      | 12x12       | False           | 14                   | False           | 4                    | Requires Rule 3 (`4-Alone` -> `6` fill below). Requires Rule 4 (Vertical `1` prop). Requires Rule 5 (Horizontal `1` & `6` prop, only fill `0`s). Requires Rule 6 (Cleanup `6`->`0`). Errors at `(0,10)`, `(1,10)`, `(2,1)`, `(3,10)`. |

*Note: "Code v1" refers to the code from the previous step (derived only from train_1). "Code v2" refers to the second code attempt incorporating rules from train_2 and train_3.*
*The pixel counts for Code v2 indicate improvement but show that the horizontal propagation for color 3 and the cleanup rule for color 6 are still missing or incorrect.*

## YAML Facts Documentation

```yaml
Grid:
  type: object
  properties:
    size: 12x12 (consistent across examples)
    cells: list of lists of integers (colors)

Colors:
  - 0: Black (Background/Empty - fillable by propagation)
  - 1: Blue (Subject to vertical and horizontal propagation)
  - 2: Red (Boundary marker for Rule 1)
  - 3: Green (Fill color for Rule 1 & 2, subject to horizontal propagation)
  - 4: Magenta (Trigger for Rule 2 and Rule 3)
  - 6: Cyan (Fill color for Rule 3, subject to horizontal propagation, potential target for cleanup)
  - 7: Orange (Secondary trigger/boundary for Rule 2)

Triggers_and_Patterns:
  - Red_Boundaries: A pair of '2's on the same row in the input grid.
  - Four_Seven: A '4' immediately followed by a '7' on the same row in the input grid.
  - Four_Alone: A '4' in the input grid NOT immediately followed by a '7', and not processed by Four_Seven rule.
  - Vertical_Gap_1_Input: A '0' cell in the input grid vertically between two '1's in the input grid.
  - Horizontal_Gap_0: A '0' cell in the working grid horizontally between two identical non-zero colors (1, 3, or 6).
  - Cleanup_Pattern_Row_Start: Row in the working grid starts with '0 1'.
  - Cleanup_Pattern_Cell: A '6' cell at column index 10 (width-2) in a row matching Cleanup_Pattern_Row_Start.

Actions:
  - Modify_Boundary_Color: Change cell color (e.g., 2 -> 3).
  - Fill_Horizontal_Segment: Change colors of cells between two columns on a row (e.g., fill with 3).
  - Place_Marker: Change a single cell's color based on context (e.g., place 1 within a 3-filled segment).
  - Copy_Row_Segment: Replace a segment of a row with the corresponding segment from the row below (based on input grid).
  - Fill_Pattern: Replace a specific pattern with another (e.g., '4 7 ...' -> '3 3 3 3').
  - Fill_Column_Segment_Vertically: Change colors of cells in a column from a trigger cell downwards (e.g., fill with 6).
  - Fill_Zero_Gap_Horizontally: Change a '0' cell's color based on its identical horizontal neighbors (iterative).
  - Fill_Zero_Gap_Vertically: Change a '0' cell's color based on its vertical neighbors (using input grid context).
  - Clear_Cell: Change a cell's color to '0'.

Rules_and_Order: (Applied sequentially)
  - 1_Red_Boundary_Transform:
      - trigger: Red_Boundaries (c1, c2) found in input[r].
      - context: Check if input[r][c1+1:c2] contains 0.
      - action: Modify output[r]: output[r][c1]=3, output[r][c2]=3, output[r][c1+1:c2]=3. Place '1' at output[r][c1+2] if 0 was found, else at output[r][c2-1].
  - 2_Four_Seven_Transform:
      - trigger: Four_Seven pattern at input[r][c] and input[r][c+1].
      - action: Modify output[r]: Replace output[r][0:c] with input[r+1][0:c]. Replace output[r][c:c+4] with [3, 3, 3, 3] (respecting grid width). Mark this '4' at (r,c) as processed.
  - 3_Four_Alone_Transform:
      - trigger: Four_Alone pattern at input[r][c] (not processed by rule 2).
      - action: Modify output grid: Set output[r][c] = 6. For i from r+1 to height-1, set output[i][c] = 6.
  - 4_Vertical_1_Propagation:
      - trigger: Vertical_Gap_1_Input at input[r][c].
      - action: Modify output grid: Set output[r][c] = 1.
  - 5_Horizontal_Propagation:
      - trigger: Horizontal_Gap_0 in the current output grid (for colors 1, 3, or 6).
      - action: Modify output grid: Fill the '0' gap with the neighbor color (1, 3, or 6). Apply iteratively per row until no changes.
  - 6_Cleanup_Row_Start_Pattern:
      - trigger: Row `r` in output grid has `output[r][0] == 0` and `output[r][1] == 1`.
      - context: Check `output[r][10] == 6`. (Assuming width 12, checking column 10 specifically based on train_3).
      - action: Modify output grid: Set `output[r][10] = 0`.
```

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create a working copy (`output_grid`) of the `input_grid`.
    *   Keep the original `input_grid` for context checks.
    *   Create a set `processed_fours` to store `(r, c)` coordinates of '4's handled by the 4-7 rule.
2.  **Apply Red Boundary Transformation (Rule 1):**
    *   Iterate through each row `r` of the `input_grid`.
    *   Find all pairs of column indices `(c1, c2)` where `input_grid[r][c1] == 2` and `input_grid[r][c2] == 2` (`c1 < c2`).
    *   For each pair:
        *   Check if any cell in `input_grid[r][c1+1 : c2]` is `0`. Store result as `found_zero`.
        *   Set `output_grid[r][c1] = 3` and `output_grid[r][c2] = 3`.
        *   Fill `output_grid[r][c1+1 : c2]` with `3`.
        *   Determine the marker position: `pos = c1 + 2` if `found_zero`, else `pos = c2 - 1`.
        *   If `c1 < pos < c2`, set `output_grid[r][pos] = 1`.
3.  **Apply 4-7 Transformation (Rule 2):**
    *   Iterate through cells `(r, c)` from `r=0` to `height-1` and `c=0` to `width-2`.
    *   If `input_grid[r][c] == 4` and `input_grid[r][c+1] == 7`:
        *   If `r + 1 < height`, copy the segment `input_grid[r+1][0:c]` to `output_grid[r][0:c]`.
        *   Replace cells in `output_grid[r]` starting at index `c` with `3`s for up to 4 positions (i.e., `c`, `c+1`, `c+2`, `c+3`), stopping at the grid boundary (`width-1`).
        *   Add `(r, c)` to `processed_fours`.
4.  **Apply 4-Alone Transformation (Rule 3):**
    *   Iterate through cells `(r, c)` from `r=0` to `height-1` and `c=0` to `width-1`.
    *   If `input_grid[r][c] == 4` AND `(r, c)` is NOT in `processed_fours`:
        *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 6`.
        *   For each row `i` from `r + 1` to `height - 1`:
            *   Set `output_grid[i][c] = 6`.
5.  **Apply Vertical 1 Propagation (Rule 4):**
    *   Iterate through cells `(r, c)` from `r=1` to `height-2` and `c=0` to `width-1`.
    *   Check the **original** `input_grid`: If `input_grid[r-1][c] == 1` AND `input_grid[r+1][c] == 1` AND `input_grid[r][c] == 0`:
        *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 1`.
6.  **Apply Horizontal Propagation (Rule 5):**
    *   Iterate through each row `r` of the `output_grid`.
    *   Start a loop that continues as long as changes are made within the row in a full pass:
        *   Set `change_made_this_pass = false`.
        *   Create a temporary copy of the current `output_grid[r]` (`temp_row`).
        *   Iterate through each column `c` from `1` to `width - 2`:
            *   If `output_grid[r][c] == 0`: # Only fill zeros
                *   If `temp_row[c-1] == 1` and `temp_row[c+1] == 1`:
                    *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 1`. Set `change_made_this_pass = true`.
                *   Else If `temp_row[c-1] == 3` and `temp_row[c+1] == 3`:
                    *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 3`. Set `change_made_this_pass = true`.
                *   Else If `temp_row[c-1] == 6` and `temp_row[c+1] == 6`:
                    *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 6`. Set `change_made_this_pass = true`.
        *   If `change_made_this_pass` is false, break the loop for this row.
7.  **Apply Cleanup for `0 1 ... 6` pattern (Rule 6):**
    *   Iterate through each row `r` of the `output_grid`.
    *   Assuming grid width is 12: If `output_grid[r][0] == 0` AND `output_grid[r][1] == 1` AND `output_grid[r][10] == 6`:
        *   Set `output_grid[r][10] = 0`.
8.  **Final Output:** Return the `output_grid`.

3.  **4-Alone Transformation (Rule 3):** Reads input grid. Finds '4' not processed by Rule 2.

4.  **Vertical 1 Propagation (Rule 4):** Reads input grid. Finds '0' vertically between two '1's.
    Changes corresponding '0' to '1' in the working grid.
5.  **Horizontal Propagation (Rule 5):** Iteratively modifies working grid. Fills '0's
    horizontally between two identical non-zero neighbors (1, 3, or 6).
6.  **Cleanup Rule (Rule 6):** Reads working grid. If a row starts '0 1 ...' and has '6'
    at column 10, changes that '6' to '0'.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code version successfully implemented the rules derived from analyzing all three examples individually (Red Boundary, 4-7, 4-Alone, Horizontal Prop, Vertical Prop). However, testing revealed discrepancies, indicating interactions between rules, incorrect rule logic, or missing rules.

**Key Findings from Errors:**

1.  **Example 1 Error (`(5, 4)`):** The horizontal propagation rule was too restrictive, only filling `0`s. It needs to overwrite existing colors (like the `3` at `(5,4)`) if they are situated between two `1`s.
2.  **Example 2 Errors (Row 4, Row 9):** The code missed vertical propagation rules. The patterns `7-0-7` and `3-0-3` in the *input* grid vertically should cause the `0` in the output grid to be filled with `7` and `3` respectively. The error at `(9,2)` indicates the horizontal propagation for `3` might have failed or interacted incorrectly, but fixing the rule as per point 1 should resolve this.
3.  **Example 3 Errors (Column 10):** The previously added "Cleanup Rule" (Rule 6) was incorrect. It wrongly zeroed out `6`s that should have remained. Removing this rule is necessary. Additionally, the horizontal propagation for `6` needs the same fix as for `1` (overwriting non-`6` colors). The order of Vertical 1 propagation relative to Horizontal propagation was also critical for cell `(2,6)`.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Horizontal Propagation (Rule 5):** Modify the rule to propagate color `X` (where X is 1, 3, or 6) into a cell `Y` if `Y` is between two `X`'s and `Y != X`. It should no longer be restricted to only filling `0`s.
2.  **Add Vertical Propagation (New Rule 5):** Introduce a rule that checks the *input* grid for vertical `X-0-X` patterns (where X is 3 or 7) and sets the corresponding cell in the *output* grid to `X`.
3.  **Adjust Rule Order:** Place all vertical propagation rules (existing `1-0-1` and new `3-0-3`, `7-0-7`) *before* the horizontal propagation rule.
4.  **Remove Incorrect Rule:** Delete the Cleanup Rule (former Rule 6).
5.  **Update Documentation:** Reflect these refined rules and their order in the YAML facts and natural language program.

  - 2: Red (Boundary marker for Rule 1)
  - 3: Green (Fill color for Rule 1 & 2, subject to vertical and horizontal propagation)
  - 4: Magenta (Trigger for Rule 2 and Rule 3)
  - 6: Cyan (Fill color for Rule 3, subject to horizontal propagation)

      - action: Replace output[r][0:c] with input[r+1][0:c]. Replace output[r][c:c+4] with [3, 3, 3, 3] (respecting grid width). Mark this '4' at (r,c) as processed.
  - 3_Four_Alone_Transform:
      - trigger: Input_Four_Alone pattern at input[r][c] (not processed by rule 2).
      - action: Set output[r][c] = 6. For i from r+1 to height-1, set output[i][c] = 6.
  - 4_Vertical_Propagation:
      - trigger: Input_Vertical_Gap_X at input[r][c] (where X is 1, 3, or 7).
      - action: Set output[r][c] = X. (Apply for all r, c before moving to next rule).
  - 5_Horizontal_Propagation:
      - trigger: Output_Horizontal_Gap_X in the current output grid (for colors X = 1, 3, or 6).
      - action: Fill the gap cell with color X (overwriting previous color Y). Apply iteratively per row until no changes.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create a working copy (`output_grid`) of the `input_grid`.
    *   Keep the original `input_grid` for context checks.
    *   Create a set `processed_fours` to store `(r, c)` coordinates of '4's handled by the 4-7 rule.
2.  **Apply Red Boundary Transformation (Rule 1):**
    *   Iterate through each row `r` of the `input_grid`.
    *   Find all pairs of column indices `(c1, c2)` where `input_grid[r][c1] == 2` and `input_grid[r][c2] == 2` (`c1 < c2`).
    *   For each pair:
        *   Check if any cell in `input_grid[r][c1+1 : c2]` is `0`. Store result as `found_zero`.
        *   Set `output_grid[r][c1] = 3` and `output_grid[r][c2] = 3`.
        *   Fill `output_grid[r][c1+1 : c2]` with `3`.
        *   Determine the marker position: `pos = c1 + 2` if `found_zero`, else `pos = c2 - 1`.
        *   If `c1 < pos < c2`, set `output_grid[r][pos] = 1`.
3.  **Apply 4-7 Transformation (Rule 2):**
    *   Iterate through cells `(r, c)` from `r=0` to `height-1` and `c=0` to `width-2`.
    *   If `input_grid[r][c] == 4` and `input_grid[r][c+1] == 7`:
        *   If `r + 1 < height`, copy the segment `input_grid[r+1][0:c]` to `output_grid[r][0:c]`.
        *   Replace cells in `output_grid[r]` starting at index `c` with `3`s for up to 4 positions (i.e., `c`, `c+1`, `c+2`, `c+3`), stopping at the grid boundary (`width-1`).
        *   Add `(r, c)` to `processed_fours`.
4.  **Apply 4-Alone Transformation (Rule 3):**
    *   Iterate through cells `(r, c)` from `r=0` to `height-1` and `c=0` to `width-1`.
    *   If `input_grid[r][c] == 4` AND `(r, c)` is NOT in `processed_fours`:
        *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 6`.
        *   For each row `i` from `r + 1` to `height - 1`:
            *   Set `output_grid[i][c] = 6`.
5.  **Apply Vertical Propagation (Rule 4):**
    *   Iterate through cells `(r, c)` from `r=1` to `height-2` and `c=0` to `width-1`.
    *   Check the **original** `input_grid`:
        *   If `input_grid[r-1][c] == 1` AND `input_grid[r+1][c] == 1` AND `input_grid[r][c] == 0`: Set `output_grid[r][c] = 1`.
        *   Else if `input_grid[r-1][c] == 3` AND `input_grid[r+1][c] == 3` AND `input_grid[r][c] == 0`: Set `output_grid[r][c] = 3`.
        *   Else if `input_grid[r-1][c] == 7` AND `input_grid[r+1][c] == 7` AND `input_grid[r][c] == 0`: Set `output_grid[r][c] = 7`.
6.  **Apply Horizontal Propagation (Rule 5):**
    *   Iterate through each row `r` of the `output_grid`.
    *   Start a loop that continues as long as changes are made within the row in a full pass:
        *   Set `change_made_this_pass = false`.
        *   Create a temporary copy of the current `output_grid[r]` (`temp_row`).
        *   Iterate through each column `c` from `1` to `width - 2`:
            *   Let `left_color = temp_row[c-1]` and `right_color = temp_row[c+1]`.
            *   Let `current_color = output_grid[r][c]`.
            *   If `left_color == right_color` AND `left_color != 0` AND `current_color != left_color`:
                *   If `left_color` is 1, 3, or 6:
                    *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = left_color`.
                    *   Set `change_made_this_pass = true`.
        *   If `change_made_this_pass` is false, break the loop for this row.
7.  **Final Output:** Return the `output_grid`.
