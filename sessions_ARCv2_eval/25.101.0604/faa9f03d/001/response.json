Its position depends on whether a '0' (black) was originally present between the boundaries:\n        - If a '0' was present, the '1' is placed at column `c1 + 2` (where `c1` is the left boundary column).\n        - If no '0' was present, the '1' is placed at column `c2 - 1` (where `c2` is the right boundary column).\n    This transformation uses the original input grid to determine the segments and the presence of '0's, but applies changes to a working copy.\n\n2.  **Blue Propagation:** Iteratively fills horizontal gaps between '1's. \n    - If a cell is not '1', but its immediate left and right neighbors in the same row are '1', the cell is changed to '1'.\n    - This process repeats for each row until no more cells can be changed in that row.\n    This transformation operates on the grid resulting from the Red Boundary Transformation pass.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_red_boundaries(row_data: list[int]) -> list[tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"Finds pairs of indices corresponding to the color 2 in a row.\"\"\"\n    indices = [i for i, color in enumerate(row_data) if color == 2]\n    pairs = []\n    # Simple pairing assuming non-overlapping boundaries as seen in examples\n    for i in range(0, len(indices), 2):\n        if i + 1 < len(indices):\n            pairs.append((indices[i], indices[i+1]))\n    return pairs\n\ndef check_zero_in_segment(row_data: list[int], c1: int, c2: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Checks if the color 0 exists in the row segment between c1+1 and c2-1.\"\"\"\n    if c1 + 1 >= c2: # Check if segment is empty or just boundaries\n        return False\n    return 0 in row_data[c1 + 1 : c2]\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the red boundary transformation and blue propagation rules to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output_grid as a deep copy of the input to modify\n    output_grid = copy.deepcopy(input_grid)\n    height = len(input_grid)\n    if height == 0:\n        return []\n    width = len(input_grid[0])\n    if width == 0:\n        return [[] for _ in range(height)]\n\n    # --- 1.
