## Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on 2D grids of numbers (representing colors). The grid dimensions vary between examples.
2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved are 0, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
3.  **Background:** Color 6 appears to be a static background color, largely unchanged between input and output.
4.  **Boundaries/Frames:** Colors 0 and 9 often form boundaries or frames around regions.
5.  **Fill Colors:** Color 5 appears as a fill color within bounded regions.
6.  **Active/Seed Color:** Color 7 appears in the input within some regions and also appears in the output, replacing some instances of color 5.
7.  **Transformation Focus:** The most consistent transformation is the change of certain cells with value 5 to value 7.
8.  **Adjacency Rule:** The change from 5 to 7 seems dependent on the proximity of the 5-cell to a 7-cell in the input grid. Specifically, if a cell containing 5 has any neighbor (orthogonal or diagonal) containing 7 in the input, that 5 changes to 7 in the output.
9.  **Anomalies/Secondary Changes:**
    *   Some examples show entire regions of 5s changing to 7s even without an adjacent input 7 (e.g., train_2, top-right shape). This might occur when a bounded region contains *only* 5s.
    *   Some specific 5s change to 7s without an apparent input 7 neighbor according to the adjacency rule (e.g., train_2 cell (14,9), train_3 cell (3,1)).
    *   Examples train_1 and train_2 exhibit other changes not related to the 5->7 transformation (e.g., 9->0, 0->6, 0->7), suggesting a more complex overall process or multiple rules at play, potentially involving row/column shifts or copies that were not fully deciphered. The core 5->7 rule seems independent of these.

## YAML Facts

```yaml
Grid:
  type: object
  properties:
    dimensionality: 2D

      type: list of lists
      items: Cell
Cell:

Shapes:
  type: object
  description: Regions of cells containing 5s and/or 7s, typically enclosed by 0s and/or 9s.
  properties:
    contains_only_5s: boolean
    contains_7s: boolean

Transformation:
  type: action
  description: Modifies the input grid to produce the output grid.
  primary_rule: Conditional change of 5 to 7 based on input neighbors.
  steps:
    - Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    - Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the input grid.
    - If input_grid[r][c] is 5:
      - Check the 8 neighbors of input_grid[r][c] in the *input* grid.
      - If any neighbor's value is 7:
        - Set output_grid[r][c] to 7.
  secondary_observations: # Rules potentially needed to explain anomalies
    - Possible rule: If a bounded shape contains only 5s (no 7s) in the input, all 5s in that shape might change to 7s in the output.
    - Unexplained changes: Some 5->7 changes occur without apparent input 7 neighbors. Other changes (9->0, 0->6, 0->7) occur in some examples.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Cells are neighbors if they share an edge or a corner.
  - Containment: Cells belong to shapes.
  - Input-Output Mapping: Each cell in the output potentially derives its value from the corresponding cell and its neighbors in the input.
```

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid (output grid) initially identical to the input grid.
2.  Examine each cell in the *input* grid.
3.  If the value of the current cell in the input grid is 5:
    a.  Check the values of its 8 neighboring cells (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) in the *input* grid.
    b.  If any of these neighboring cells in the input grid has the value 7:
        i.  Change the value of the corresponding cell in the *output* grid to 7.
4.  *(Note: This primary rule doesn't account for all observed changes. Some shapes filled entirely with 5s seem to turn entirely to 7s, some specific 5s turn to 7s without apparent 7-neighbors, and other unrelated color changes (involving 0, 6, 9) occur in specific examples, indicating potentially missing context or more complex rules.)*
5.  The final state of the output grid is the result.
