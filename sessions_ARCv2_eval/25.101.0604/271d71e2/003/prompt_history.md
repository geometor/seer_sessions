## Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on 2D grids of numbers (representing colors). The grid dimensions vary between examples.
2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved are 0, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
3.  **Background:** Color 6 appears to be a static background color, largely unchanged between input and output.
4.  **Boundaries/Frames:** Colors 0 and 9 often form boundaries or frames around regions.
5.  **Fill Colors:** Color 5 appears as a fill color within bounded regions.
6.  **Active/Seed Color:** Color 7 appears in the input within some regions and also appears in the output, replacing some instances of color 5.
7.  **Transformation Focus:** The most consistent transformation is the change of certain cells with value 5 to value 7.
8.  **Adjacency Rule:** The change from 5 to 7 seems dependent on the proximity of the 5-cell to a 7-cell in the input grid. Specifically, if a cell containing 5 has any neighbor (orthogonal or diagonal) containing 7 in the input, that 5 changes to 7 in the output.
9.  **Anomalies/Secondary Changes:**
    *   Some examples show entire regions of 5s changing to 7s even without an adjacent input 7 (e.g., train_2, top-right shape). This might occur when a bounded region contains *only* 5s.
    *   Some specific 5s change to 7s without an apparent input 7 neighbor according to the adjacency rule (e.g., train_2 cell (14,9), train_3 cell (3,1)).
    *   Examples train_1 and train_2 exhibit other changes not related to the 5->7 transformation (e.g., 9->0, 0->6, 0->7), suggesting a more complex overall process or multiple rules at play, potentially involving row/column shifts or copies that were not fully deciphered. The core 5->7 rule seems independent of these.

## YAML Facts

    contains_7s: boolean

Transformation:
  type: action
  description: Modifies the input grid to produce the output grid.
  primary_rule: Conditional change of 5 to 7 based on input neighbors.
  steps:
    - Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    - Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the input grid.
    - If input_grid[r][c] is 5:
      - Check the 8 neighbors of input_grid[r][c] in the *input* grid.
      - If any neighbor's value is 7:
        - Set output_grid[r][c] to 7.
  secondary_observations: # Rules potentially needed to explain anomalies
    - Possible rule: If a bounded shape contains only 5s (no 7s) in the input, all 5s in that shape might change to 7s in the output.
    - Unexplained changes: Some 5->7 changes occur without apparent input 7 neighbors. Other changes (9->0, 0->6, 0->7) occur in some examples.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Cells are neighbors if they share an edge or a corner.
  - Containment: Cells belong to shapes.
  - Input-Output Mapping: Each cell in the output potentially derives its value from the corresponding cell and its neighbors in the input.
```

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid (output grid) initially identical to the input grid.
2.  Examine each cell in the *input* grid.
3.  If the value of the current cell in the input grid is 5:
    a.  Check the values of its 8 neighboring cells (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) in the *input* grid.
    b.  If any of these neighboring cells in the input grid has the value 7:
        i.  Change the value of the corresponding cell in the *output* grid to 7.
4.  *(Note: This primary rule doesn't account for all observed changes. Some shapes filled entirely with 5s seem to turn entirely to 7s, some specific 5s turn to 7s without apparent 7-neighbors, and other unrelated color changes (involving 0, 6, 9) occur in specific examples, indicating potentially missing context or more complex rules.)*
5.  The final state of the output grid is the result.

## General Assessment

The initial code implemented only the most basic observation: changing a `5` to a `7` if it had an immediate neighbor `7` in the *input* grid. The results clearly show this rule is insufficient and incorrect in several ways:

1.  **Missed 5 -> 7 Changes:** Many cells change from 5 to 7 even without a direct neighbor 7 in the input. This suggests a propagation or flood-fill mechanism, or perhaps a rule based on the overall shape's content.
2.  **Other Color Changes:** Significant changes involving colors 0, 6, and 9 occur, which were completely ignored by the initial code. These seem related to the boundaries or frames of the shapes containing 5s and 7s, and sometimes involve shifting or copying entire rows/regions (e.g., Example 1 top/bottom rows, Example 2/3 frame modifications).
3.  **Input vs. Output State:** The rule was based solely on the *input* grid's neighbors. The propagation behavior suggests that changes might need to consider the *evolving* state of the grid during the transformation.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Analyze 5->7 Propagation:** Re-examine the examples focusing on *how* the 7s spread. Hypothesize a flood-fill or iterative approach: Start with input 7s, change adjacent 5s to 7s, then check neighbors of those newly changed 7s, repeating until no more changes occur.
2.  **Analyze "All 5s" Shapes:** Identify shapes enclosed by 0s/9s that contain *only* 5s in the input. Check if these consistently turn entirely into 7s in the output (as seen in Example 2).
3.  **Analyze Boundary/Frame Changes:** Systematically compare the input and output frames/boundaries around the 5/7 shapes. Look for consistent patterns like `0...0 9` becoming `6...0 9` (Example 3) or row shifts/copies (Example 1). These might be separate rules applied after or before the main 5->7 transformation.
4.  **Refine the Model:** Incorporate these new rules into the natural language program and subsequent code attempts. Prioritize the 5->7 propagation/fill rules, as they seem more central to the core transformation. Acknowledge the boundary changes might require more complex pattern recognition.

Input Row 2 (9s...) -> Output Row 3 (0s...). Input Row 3 (0s...) -> Output Row 3 (0 7 5 0...). Code makes none of these boundary/shift changes.                                                           |

Middle-left shape (all 5s) -> all 7s. **Missed 5->7 (Propagation?):** Bottom-left shape Input(13,5)=5, Input(13,6)=5 -> Output=7. Code leaves all these as 5. **Boundary Changes:** Complex changes around shapes involving 0, 6, 9 (e.g., 6->9, 0->6, 9->0, 6->0). Code makes none. |

**Summary of Error Types:**

1.  **Incomplete 5->7 Conversion:** The code only handles direct adjacency to *input* 7s. It misses cases where:
    *   7s seem to propagate or flood-fill from existing 7s.
    *   Entire regions containing only 5s are converted to 7s.
2.  **Boundary/Frame Transformations:** The code completely misses rules that modify the 0, 6, and 9 cells, often forming the boundaries of the active regions. These rules appear complex and context-dependent.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid (output grid) initially identical to the input grid.
2.  **Identify Regions:** Mentally (or algorithmically) identify distinct connected regions containing cells with values 5 or 7, primarily bounded by cells with values 0 or 9.
3.  **Handle Regions with Only 5s:** For each identified region, if it contains *only* cells with value 5 (and no 7s) in the *input* grid, change the value of *all* cells within that region to 7 in the *output* grid.
4.  **Propagate 7s (Flood Fill):**
    a.  Create a list or set of locations `(r, c)` for all cells that have value 7 in the *current* state of the output grid (this initially includes original input 7s and any 7s created in step 3).
    b.  Iteratively check the 8 neighbors of every location in the list:
        i.  If a neighbor `(nr, nc)` exists within the grid boundaries and its value in the *output* grid is 5, change its value to 7 in the *output* grid and add its location `(nr, nc)` to a list of newly changed cells for the *next* iteration.
    c.  Repeat step 4b using the list of newly changed cells from the previous iteration, until an iteration occurs where no 5s are changed to 7s.
5.  **Apply Boundary Transformations (Heuristic/Incomplete Rules):**
    *   *(Example 1 Specific?)* If the top row consists entirely of 6s, copy it to replace the bottom row.
    *   *(Example 1 Specific?)* If a row consists entirely of 9s (potentially excluding boundary 6s) and is above a row of 0s, change the 9s row to 0s.
    *   *(Example 3 Specific?)* If a region's top/bottom boundary in the input is `0 0 0 0 0 9`, change the `0`s to `6`s in the output (`6 6 6 6 6 0`). *(Need to generalize this - maybe related to the shape type/content?)*
    *   *(Other Examples)* Look for other specific input boundary patterns (like sequences of 0s, 6s, 9s) adjacent to the 5/7 regions and apply corresponding learned output patterns. (These rules are currently the least understood and require more examples or analysis to generalize).
6.  The final state of the output grid is the result.
