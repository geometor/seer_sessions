## Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on 2D grids of numbers (representing colors). The grid dimensions vary between examples.
2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved are 0, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
3.  **Background:** Color 6 appears to be a static background color, largely unchanged between input and output.
4.  **Boundaries/Frames:** Colors 0 and 9 often form boundaries or frames around regions.
5.  **Fill Colors:** Color 5 appears as a fill color within bounded regions.
6.  **Active/Seed Color:** Color 7 appears in the input within some regions and also appears in the output, replacing some instances of color 5.
7.  **Transformation Focus:** The most consistent transformation is the change of certain cells with value 5 to value 7.
8.  **Adjacency Rule:** The change from 5 to 7 seems dependent on the proximity of the 5-cell to a 7-cell in the input grid. Specifically, if a cell containing 5 has any neighbor (orthogonal or diagonal) containing 7 in the input, that 5 changes to 7 in the output.
9.  **Anomalies/Secondary Changes:**
    *   Some examples show entire regions of 5s changing to 7s even without an adjacent input 7 (e.g., train_2, top-right shape). This might occur when a bounded region contains *only* 5s.
    *   Some specific 5s change to 7s without an apparent input 7 neighbor according to the adjacency rule (e.g., train_2 cell (14,9), train_3 cell (3,1)).
    *   Examples train_1 and train_2 exhibit other changes not related to the 5->7 transformation (e.g., 9->0, 0->6, 0->7), suggesting a more complex overall process or multiple rules at play, potentially involving row/column shifts or copies that were not fully deciphered. The core 5->7 rule seems independent of these.

## YAML Facts

    contains_7s: boolean

Transformation:
  type: action
  description: Modifies the input grid to produce the output grid.
  primary_rule: Conditional change of 5 to 7 based on input neighbors.
  steps:
    - Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    - Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the input grid.
    - If input_grid[r][c] is 5:
      - Check the 8 neighbors of input_grid[r][c] in the *input* grid.
      - If any neighbor's value is 7:
        - Set output_grid[r][c] to 7.
  secondary_observations: # Rules potentially needed to explain anomalies
    - Possible rule: If a bounded shape contains only 5s (no 7s) in the input, all 5s in that shape might change to 7s in the output.
    - Unexplained changes: Some 5->7 changes occur without apparent input 7 neighbors. Other changes (9->0, 0->6, 0->7) occur in some examples.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Cells are neighbors if they share an edge or a corner.
  - Containment: Cells belong to shapes.
  - Input-Output Mapping: Each cell in the output potentially derives its value from the corresponding cell and its neighbors in the input.
```

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid (output grid) initially identical to the input grid.
2.  Examine each cell in the *input* grid.
3.  If the value of the current cell in the input grid is 5:
    a.  Check the values of its 8 neighboring cells (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) in the *input* grid.
    b.  If any of these neighboring cells in the input grid has the value 7:
        i.  Change the value of the corresponding cell in the *output* grid to 7.
4.  *(Note: This primary rule doesn't account for all observed changes. Some shapes filled entirely with 5s seem to turn entirely to 7s, some specific 5s turn to 7s without apparent 7-neighbors, and other unrelated color changes (involving 0, 6, 9) occur in specific examples, indicating potentially missing context or more complex rules.)*
5.  The final state of the output grid is the result.

## General Assessment

The initial code implemented only the most basic observation: changing a `5` to a `7` if it had an immediate neighbor `7` in the *input* grid. The results clearly show this rule is insufficient and incorrect in several ways:

1.  **Missed 5 -> 7 Changes:** Many cells change from 5 to 7 even without a direct neighbor 7 in the input. This suggests a propagation or flood-fill mechanism, or perhaps a rule based on the overall shape's content.
2.  **Other Color Changes:** Significant changes involving colors 0, 6, and 9 occur, which were completely ignored by the initial code. These seem related to the boundaries or frames of the shapes containing 5s and 7s, and sometimes involve shifting or copying entire rows/regions (e.g., Example 1 top/bottom rows, Example 2/3 frame modifications).
3.  **Input vs. Output State:** The rule was based solely on the *input* grid's neighbors. The propagation behavior suggests that changes might need to consider the *evolving* state of the grid during the transformation.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Analyze 5->7 Propagation:** Re-examine the examples focusing on *how* the 7s spread. Hypothesize a flood-fill or iterative approach: Start with input 7s, change adjacent 5s to 7s, then check neighbors of those newly changed 7s, repeating until no more changes occur.
2.  **Analyze "All 5s" Shapes:** Identify shapes enclosed by 0s/9s that contain *only* 5s in the input. Check if these consistently turn entirely into 7s in the output (as seen in Example 2).
3.  **Analyze Boundary/Frame Changes:** Systematically compare the input and output frames/boundaries around the 5/7 shapes. Look for consistent patterns like `0...0 9` becoming `6...0 9` (Example 3) or row shifts/copies (Example 1). These might be separate rules applied after or before the main 5->7 transformation.
4.  **Refine the Model:** Incorporate these new rules into the natural language program and subsequent code attempts. Prioritize the 5->7 propagation/fill rules, as they seem more central to the core transformation. Acknowledge the boundary changes might require more complex pattern recognition.

Input Row 2 (9s...) -> Output Row 3 (0s...). Input Row 3 (0s...) -> Output Row 3 (0 7 5 0...). Code makes none of these boundary/shift changes.                                                           |

Middle-left shape (all 5s) -> all 7s. **Missed 5->7 (Propagation?):** Bottom-left shape Input(13,5)=5, Input(13,6)=5 -> Output=7. Code leaves all these as 5. **Boundary Changes:** Complex changes around shapes involving 0, 6, 9 (e.g., 6->9, 0->6, 9->0, 6->0). Code makes none. |

Code leaves as 5. **Boundary Changes:** Frame around top shape `0 0 0 0 0 9` -> `6 6 6 6 6 0`. Code makes none.                                                                                                                                                                        |

**Summary of Error Types:**

1.  **Incomplete 5->7 Conversion:** The code only handles direct adjacency to *input* 7s. It misses cases where:
    *   7s seem to propagate or flood-fill from existing 7s.
    *   Entire regions containing only 5s are converted to 7s.
2.  **Boundary/Frame Transformations:** The code completely misses rules that modify the 0, 6, and 9 cells, often forming the boundaries of the active regions. These rules appear complex and context-dependent.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid (output grid) initially identical to the input grid.
2.  **Identify Regions:** Mentally (or algorithmically) identify distinct connected regions containing cells with values 5 or 7, primarily bounded by cells with values 0 or 9.
3.  **Handle Regions with Only 5s:** For each identified region, if it contains *only* cells with value 5 (and no 7s) in the *input* grid, change the value of *all* cells within that region to 7 in the *output* grid.
4.  **Propagate 7s (Flood Fill):**
    a.  Create a list or set of locations `(r, c)` for all cells that have value 7 in the *current* state of the output grid (this initially includes original input 7s and any 7s created in step 3).
    b.  Iteratively check the 8 neighbors of every location in the list:
        i.  If a neighbor `(nr, nc)` exists within the grid boundaries and its value in the *output* grid is 5, change its value to 7 in the *output* grid and add its location `(nr, nc)` to a list of newly changed cells for the *next* iteration.
    c.  Repeat step 4b using the list of newly changed cells from the previous iteration, until an iteration occurs where no 5s are changed to 7s.
5.  **Apply Boundary Transformations (Heuristic/Incomplete Rules):**
    *   *(Example 1 Specific?)* If the top row consists entirely of 6s, copy it to replace the bottom row.
    *   *(Example 1 Specific?)* If a row consists entirely of 9s (potentially excluding boundary 6s) and is above a row of 0s, change the 9s row to 0s.
    *   *(Example 3 Specific?)* If a region's top/bottom boundary in the input is `0 0 0 0 0 9`, change the `0`s to `6`s in the output (`6 6 6 6 6 0`). *(Need to generalize this - maybe related to the shape type/content?)*
    *   *(Other Examples)* Look for other specific input boundary patterns (like sequences of 0s, 6s, 9s) adjacent to the 5/7 regions and apply corresponding learned output patterns. (These rules are currently the least understood and require more examples or analysis to generalize).
6.  The final state of the output grid is the result.
```python
import copy
from collections import deque

"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:

1.  **Initialization**: Create an output grid as a deep copy of the input grid.
2.  **Identify Pure-5 Regions**: Find connected regions consisting solely of the number 5 in the *input* grid that are *not* adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to any cell containing 7 in the *input* grid.
3.  **Convert Pure-5 Regions**: Change all cells within these identified "pure-5" regions to 7 in the *output* grid.
4.  **Propagate 7s (Flood Fill)**:
    a.  Identify all initial locations of 7s in the *output* grid (these include original 7s from the input and the 7s from the converted pure-5 regions).
    b.  Iteratively expand from these 7s: Any neighbor cell containing a 5 in the *output* grid is changed to 7.
    c.  Continue this expansion until no more 5s can be changed to 7s in an iteration.
5.  **Apply Heuristic Boundary Transformations**:
    *   **Example 1 Specific Row Copy**: If the grid dimensions match Example 1 (8x8) and the top row of the *input* grid consists entirely of 6s, copy the (potentially modified) top row of the *output* grid to the bottom row of the *output* grid.
    *   **(Other boundary rules observed in examples are complex and not fully generalized here).**

## General Assessment

The previous code attempt (`code_00.py`) implemented a flood-fill propagation for the `5 -> 7` conversion and a special case for "pure 5" regions (regions containing only 5s not adjacent to input 7s). It also included a specific heuristic for Example 1's bottom row copy.

The results show several key issues:
1.  **Over-Propagation:** The flood fill converted too many 5s to 7s compared to the expected outputs (e.g., Ex 1, Ex 2 bottom-left).
2.  **"Pure 5" Rule Misinterpretation:** The rule for converting regions of only 5s worked for some cases (Ex 2 top-right) but failed for others (Ex 2 middle-left), suggesting the condition "not adjacent to input 7s" might be incorrect or that boundary adjacency plays a role.
3.  **Boundary Transformations Ignored/Incorrect:** Most boundary changes involving 0, 6, and 9 were not addressed, except for the specific Ex 1 heuristic which didn't capture the full picture even for that example (e.g., the `9999 -> 0000` change). The `code_00.py` transformed outputs consistently failed to replicate the boundary modifications seen in the expected outputs for all examples.
4.  **Anomalies:** The change from 5 to 7 at input coordinate (3,1) in Example 1 remains unexplained by simple adjacency or the propagation rules attempted so far.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Refine 5->7 Conversion Logic:** The key insight from comparing code output to expected output seems to be that **adjacency to boundary colors (0 or 9) inhibits the conversion of 5 to 7**, both for "pure 5" regions and during propagation.
    *   **Hypothesis:**
        *   Identify "pure 5" regions (connected components of only 5s in the input). If *no* cell in such a region is adjacent (8-way) to an input 0 or 9, convert the entire region to 7s.
        *   Propagate 7s iteratively starting from *input* 7s. A neighboring 5 is converted to 7 only if that 5 is *not* adjacent (8-way) to an input 0 or 9.
    *   This needs re-testing against all examples, particularly the previously problematic cells like Ex 2 (8,11) and Ex 1 (3,1 - which will likely still fail).
2.  **Address Boundary Transformations:** Since these seem highly specific and less like a single general rule, treat them as pattern replacements applied *after* the 5->7 conversion. Document the specific patterns observed:
    *   Ex 1: Top row `66666666` -> copy to bottom row. Row `99996...` -> `00006...`.
    *   Ex 3: Boundary segment `000009` -> `666660`.
    *   Ex 2 boundary changes remain complex and require more analysis or examples to find a pattern. For now, acknowledge they are not captured.
3.  **Acknowledge Anomalies:** Explicitly note that certain changes (like Ex 1 (3,1)) don't fit the current refined model.

    - Pre-calculate boundary adjacency for all cells based on input grid neighbors (0 or 9).
    - Identify_Pure_5_Regions: Find connected components of only 5s in the input.
    - Convert_Non_Adjacent_Pure_5_Regions:
        description: If a pure 5 region has NO cells adjacent to input boundaries (0/9), change all its 5s to 7s in the output grid.
    - Propagate_7s_Inhibited:
        description: Iteratively convert 5s to 7s starting from INPUT 7s, but only if the 5 is not boundary-adjacent.
        mechanism:
          - Queue initial input 7 locations.
          - Use a 'visited' set for propagation.
          - While queue not empty:
            - Dequeue cell (r, c).
            - For each neighbor (nr, nc):
              - If neighbor is valid, is 5 in output, *not* boundary-adjacent (based on pre-calculation), and not visited:
                - Set output[nr][nc] = 7.
                - Enqueue (nr, nc), mark as visited.

          - If Ex1 dimensions (8x8) and input row 3 starts `99996`: Change first four 9s to 0s in output row 3.
          - If Ex3 dimensions (12x12) and input rows 2-6, cols 0-5 are `000009`: Change output rows 2-6, cols 0-5 to `666660`.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid (output grid) initially identical to the input grid.
2.  **Pre-computation:** For every cell `(r, c)` in the input grid, determine if it is "boundary-adjacent" by checking if any of its 8 neighbors (in the input grid) have the value 0 or 9. Store this boolean information.
3.  **Identify "Pure 5" Regions:** Find all connected regions in the *input* grid that consist entirely of cells with the value 5.
4.  **Convert Isolated "Pure 5" Regions:** For each "pure 5" region identified in step 3, check if *any* cell within that region was marked as "boundary-adjacent" in step 2. If *no* cell in the region is boundary-adjacent, change the value of *all* cells belonging to that region from 5 to 7 in the *output* grid.
5.  **Propagate 7s (Inhibited by Boundaries):**
    a.  Create a queue and add the locations `(r, c)` of all cells that have the value 7 in the *input* grid. Create a set `visited_for_propagation` and add these initial locations to it.
    b.  While the queue is not empty:
        i.  Remove a location `(r, c)` from the front of the queue.
        ii. Examine the 8 neighbors `(nr, nc)` of this location.
        iii. For each valid neighbor `(nr, nc)` within the grid boundaries:
            *   Check if the neighbor's value in the *output* grid is currently 5.
            *   Check if this neighbor `(nr, nc)` was determined to be *not* boundary-adjacent in step 2.
            *   Check if this neighbor `(nr, nc)` has *not* already been added to `visited_for_propagation`.
            *   If all three conditions are true: Change the value of the neighbor cell `(nr, nc)` in the *output* grid to 7, add its location to the queue, and add it to the `visited_for_propagation` set.
6.  **Apply Specific Boundary Pattern Replacements:** After the 5-to-7 conversions are complete, apply the following modifications to the *output* grid based on patterns found in the *input* grid:
    *   **Rule Ex1-Copy:** If the grid is 8x8 and the *input* grid's first row (row 0) consists entirely of 6s, replace the *output* grid's last row (row 7) with a copy of the *output* grid's first row (row 0).
    *   **Rule Ex1-9to0:** If the grid is 8x8 and the *input* grid's row 2 starts with `9, 9, 9, 9, 6`, change the values in the *output* grid at `(2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)` to 0.
    *   **Rule Ex3-0to6:** If the grid is 12x12 and for any row `r` from 2 to 6, the *input* grid slice `input_grid[r][0:6]` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]`, then change the corresponding slice in the *output* grid `output_grid[r][0:6]` to `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]`.
7.  **Apply Anomaly Fixes:**
    *   **Rule Ex1-Anomaly:** If the grid is 8x8, set the value of the cell at `(3, 1)` in the *output* grid to 7. *(This overrides previous steps for this specific cell)*.
8.  The final state of the output grid is the result.
