The results clearly show this rule is insufficient and incorrect in several ways:\n\n1.  **Missed 5 -> 7 Changes:** Many cells change from 5 to 7 even without a direct neighbor 7 in the input. This suggests a propagation or flood-fill mechanism, or perhaps a rule based on the overall shape's content.\n2.  **Other Color Changes:** Significant changes involving colors 0, 6, and 9 occur, which were completely ignored by the initial code. These seem related to the boundaries or frames of the shapes containing 5s and 7s, and sometimes involve shifting or copying entire rows/regions (e.g., Example 1 top/bottom rows, Example 2/3 frame modifications).\n3.  **Input vs. Output State:** The rule was based solely on the *input* grid's neighbors. The propagation behavior suggests that changes might need to consider the *evolving* state of the grid during the transformation.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Analyze 5->7 Propagation:** Re-examine the examples focusing on *how* the 7s spread. Hypothesize a flood-fill or iterative approach: Start with input 7s, change adjacent 5s to 7s, then check neighbors of those newly changed 7s, repeating until no more changes occur.\n2.  **Analyze \"All 5s\" Shapes:** Identify shapes enclosed by 0s/9s that contain *only* 5s in the input. Check if these consistently turn entirely into 7s in the output (as seen in Example 2).\n3.  **Analyze Boundary/Frame Changes:** Systematically compare the input and output frames/boundaries around the 5/7 shapes. Look for consistent patterns like `0...0 9` becoming `6...0 9` (Example 3) or row shifts/copies (Example 1). These might be separate rules applied after or before the main 5->7 transformation.\n4.  **Refine the Model:** Incorporate these new rules into the natural language program and subsequent code attempts. Prioritize the 5->7 propagation/fill rules, as they seem more central to the core transformation. Acknowledge the boundary changes might require more complex pattern recognition.\n\n## Metrics and Observations\n\n| Example | Match | Pixels Off | Size Correct | Palette Correct | Color Count Correct | Key Discrepancies (Input -> Expected Output vs. Transformed Output)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| :------ | :---- | :--------- | :----------- | :-------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **1**   | False | 20         | True         | True            | False               | **Missed 5->7:** Input(3,1)=5 -> Output(3,1)=7 (Code leaves as 5). **Boundary Changes:** Input Row 1 (all 6s) -> Output Row 7 (all 6s). Input Row 2 (9s...) -> Output Row 3 (0s...). Input Row 3 (0s...) -> Output Row 3 (0 7 5 0...). Code makes none of these boundary/shift changes.                                                           |\n| **2**   | False | 113        | True         | True            | False               | **Missed 5->7 (No Input 7):** Top-right shape (all 5s) -> all 7s. Middle-left shape (all 5s) -> all 7s. **Missed 5->7 (Propagation?):** Bottom-left shape Input(13,5)=5, Input(13,6)=5 -> Output=7. Code leaves all these as 5. **Boundary Changes:** Complex changes around shapes involving 0, 6, 9 (e.g., 6->9, 0->6, 9->0, 6->0). Code makes none. |\n| **3**   | False | 50         | True         | True            | False               | **Missed 5->7 (Propagation?):** Top shape Input(5,3)=5 -> Output=7. Code leaves as 5. **Boundary Changes:** Frame around top shape `0 0 0 0 0 9` -> `6 6 6 6 6 0`.

It misses cases where:\n    *   7s seem to propagate or flood-fill from existing 7s.\n    *   Entire regions containing only 5s are converted to 7s.\n2.  **Boundary/Frame Transformations:** The code completely misses rules that modify the 0, 6, and 9 cells, often forming the boundaries of the active regions. These rules appear complex and context-dependent.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n```yaml\nGrid:\n  type: object\n  properties:\n    dimensionality: 2D\n    cells:\n      type: list of lists\n      items: Cell\n\nCell:\n  type: object\n  properties:\n    value:\n      type: integer\n      description: Represents a color (0, 5, 6, 7, 9)\n    position:\n      type: tuple (row, column)\n    neighbors:\n      type: list of Cells\n      description: 8 adjacent cells (orthogonal and diagonal)\n\nColors:\n  - id: 0\n    role: Boundary / Frame component (mutable)\n  - id: 5\n    role: Fill color (mutable to 7)\n  - id: 6\n    role: Background / Boundary component (mutable)\n  - id: 7\n    role: Active/Seed color, Target fill color\n  - id: 9\n    role: Boundary / Frame component (mutable)\n\nRegion: # Abstract object representing connected areas\n  type: object\n  properties:\n    boundary_colors: list of [0, 9]\n    fill_colors: list of [5, 7]\n    contains_only_5s: boolean # Derived property based on input state\n    contains_7s: boolean # Derived property based on input state\n\nTransformation:\n  type: action\n  description: Modifies the input grid based on region analysis and propagation.\n  sub_actions:\n    - Identify_Regions: Detect connected areas of 5s/7s bounded by 0s/9s.\n    - Flood_Fill_7s: # Primary transformation for 5s\n        description: Convert 5s to 7s based on proximity to 7s (input or newly converted).\n        trigger: Presence of 7s within or adjacent to a region of 5s.\n        mechanism: Iterative expansion or flood fill starting from all 7s.\n        rules:\n          - If a cell is 5 and has any 7 as a neighbor (in the current state), it becomes 7.\n          - Repeat until no more 5s can be converted this way.\n    - Convert_Pure_5_Regions: # Handles shapes with no initial 7s\n        description: Convert all 5s in a region to 7s.\n        trigger: A region contains only 5s (and no 7s) in the input.\n    - Boundary_Manipulation: # Secondary, less clear transformations\n        description: Modify boundary cells (0, 6, 9) based on region properties or specific patterns.\n        examples:\n          - Row copy/shift (Ex 1)\n          - Pattern substitution near boundaries (e.g., 0->6, 6->0, 9->0) (Ex 1, 2, 3)\n        trigger: Context-dependent (specific shape types, locations, or boundary patterns).

Create a new grid (output grid) initially identical to the input grid.\n2.  **Identify Regions:** Mentally (or algorithmically) identify distinct connected regions containing cells with values 5 or 7, primarily bounded by cells with values 0 or 9.\n3.  **Handle Regions with Only 5s:** For each identified region, if it contains *only* cells with value 5 (and no 7s) in the *input* grid, change the value of *all* cells within that region to 7 in the *output* grid.\n4.  **Propagate 7s (Flood Fill):**\n    a.  Create a list or set of locations `(r, c)` for all cells that have value 7 in the *current* state of the output grid (this initially includes original input 7s and any 7s created in step 3).\n    b.  Iteratively check the 8 neighbors of every location in the list:\n        i.  If a neighbor `(nr, nc)` exists within the grid boundaries and its value in the *output* grid is 5, change its value to 7 in the *output* grid and add its location `(nr, nc)` to a list of newly changed cells for the *next* iteration.\n    c.  Repeat step 4b using the list of newly changed cells from the previous iteration, until an iteration occurs where no 5s are changed to 7s.\n5.  **Apply Boundary Transformations (Heuristic/Incomplete Rules):**\n    *   *(Example 1 Specific?)* If the top row consists entirely of 6s, copy it to replace the bottom row.\n    *   *(Example 1 Specific?)* If a row consists entirely of 9s (potentially excluding boundary 6s) and is above a row of 0s, change the 9s row to 0s.\n    *   *(Example 3 Specific?)* If a region's top/bottom boundary in the input is `0 0 0 0 0 9`, change the `0`s to `6`s in the output (`6 6 6 6 6 0`). *(Need to generalize this - maybe related to the shape type/content?)*\n    *   *(Other Examples)* Look for other specific input boundary patterns (like sequences of 0s, 6s, 9s) adjacent to the 5/7 regions and apply corresponding learned output patterns. (These rules are currently the least understood and require more examples or analysis to generalize).\n6.  The final state of the output grid is the result."
