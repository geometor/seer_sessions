            "text": "## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on 2D grids of numbers (representing colors). The grid dimensions vary between examples.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved are 0, 5, 6, 7, and 9.\n3.  **Background:** Color 6 appears to be a static background color, largely unchanged between input and output.\n4.  **Boundaries/Frames:** Colors 0 and 9 often form boundaries or frames around regions.\n5.  **Fill Colors:** Color 5 appears as a fill color within bounded regions.\n6.  **Active/Seed Color:** Color 7 appears in the input within some regions and also appears in the output, replacing some instances of color 5.\n7.  **Transformation Focus:** The most consistent transformation is the change of certain cells with value 5 to value 7.\n8.  **Adjacency Rule:** The change from 5 to 7 seems dependent on the proximity of the 5-cell to a 7-cell in the input grid. Specifically, if a cell containing 5 has any neighbor (orthogonal or diagonal) containing 7 in the input, that 5 changes to 7 in the output.\n9.  **Anomalies/Secondary Changes:**\n    *   Some examples show entire regions of 5s changing to 7s even without an adjacent input 7 (e.g., train_2, top-right shape). This might occur when a bounded region contains *only* 5s.\n    *   Some specific 5s change to 7s without an apparent input 7 neighbor according to the adjacency rule (e.g., train_2 cell (14,9), train_3 cell (3,1)).\n    *   Examples train_1 and train_2 exhibit other changes not related to the 5->7 transformation (e.g., 9->0, 0->6, 0->7), suggesting a more complex overall process or multiple rules at play, potentially involving row/column shifts or copies that were not fully deciphered. The core 5->7 rule seems independent of these.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n```yaml\nGrid:\n  type: object\n  properties:\n    dimensionality: 2D\n    cells:\n      type: list of lists\n      items: Cell\nCell:\n  type: object\n  properties:\n    value:\n      type: integer\n      description: Represents a color (0, 5, 6, 7, 9)\n    position:\n      type: tuple (row, column)\n    neighbors:\n      type: list of Cells\n      description: 8 adjacent cells (orthogonal and diagonal)\n\nColors:\n  - id: 0\n    role: Boundary / Frame component\n  - id: 5\n    role: Fill color (potentially mutable)\n  - id: 6\n    role: Background (mostly static)\n  - id: 7\n    role: Active/Seed color, Output fill color\n  - id: 9\n    role: Boundary / Frame component\n\nShapes:\n  type: object\n  description: Regions of cells containing 5s and/or 7s, typically enclosed by 0s and/or 9s.\n  properties:\n    contains_only_5s: boolean\n    contains_7s: boolean\n\nTransformation:\n  type: action\n  description: Modifies the input grid to produce the output grid.\n  primary_rule: Conditional change of 5 to 7 based on input neighbors.\n  steps:\n    - Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    - Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the input grid.\n    - If input_grid[r][c] is 5:\n      - Check the 8 neighbors of input_grid[r][c] in the *input* grid.\n      - If any neighbor's value is 7:\n        - Set output_grid[r][c] to 7.\n  secondary_observations: # Rules potentially needed to explain anomalies\n    - Possible rule: If a bounded shape contains only 5s (no 7s) in the input, all 5s in that shape might change to 7s in the output.\n    - Unexplained changes: Some 5->7 changes occur without apparent input 7 neighbors. Other changes (9->0, 0->6, 0->7) occur in some examples.\n\nRelationships:\n  - Adjacency: Cells are neighbors if they share an edge or a corner.\n  - Containment: Cells belong to shapes.\n  - Input-Output Mapping: Each cell in the output potentially derives its value from the corresponding cell and its neighbors in the input.\n```\n\n## Natural Language Program\n\n1.  Create a new grid (output grid) initially identical to the input grid.\n2.  Examine each cell in the *input* grid.\n3.  If the value of the current cell in the input grid is 5:\n    a.  Check the values of its 8 neighboring cells (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) in the *input* grid.\n    b.  If any of these neighboring cells in the input grid has the value 7:\n        i.  Change the value of the corresponding cell in the *output* grid to 7.\n4.  *(Note: This primary rule doesn't account for all observed changes. Some shapes filled entirely with 5s seem to turn entirely to 7s, some specific 5s turn to 7s without apparent 7-neighbors, and other unrelated color changes (involving 0, 6, 9) occur in specific examples, indicating potentially missing context or more complex rules.)*\n5.  The final state of the output grid is the result."
