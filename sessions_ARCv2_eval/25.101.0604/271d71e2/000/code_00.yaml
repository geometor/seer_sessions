Grid:
  type: object
  properties:
    dimensionality: 2D
    cells:
      type: list of lists
      items: Cell
Cell:
  type: object
  properties:
    value:
      type: integer
      description: Represents a color (0, 5, 6, 7, 9)
    position:
      type: tuple (row, column)
    neighbors:
      type: list of Cells
      description: 8 adjacent cells (orthogonal and diagonal)

Colors:
  - id: 0
    role: Boundary / Frame component
  - id: 5
    role: Fill color (potentially mutable)
  - id: 6
    role: Background (mostly static)
  - id: 7
    role: Active/Seed color, Output fill color
  - id: 9
    role: Boundary / Frame component

Shapes:
  type: object
  description: Regions of cells containing 5s and/or 7s, typically enclosed by 0s and/or 9s.
  properties:
    contains_only_5s: boolean
    contains_7s: boolean

Transformation:
  type: action
  description: Modifies the input grid to produce the output grid.
  primary_rule: Conditional change of 5 to 7 based on input neighbors.
  steps:
    - Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    - Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the input grid.
    - If input_grid[r][c] is 5:
      - Check the 8 neighbors of input_grid[r][c] in the *input* grid.
      - If any neighbor's value is 7:
        - Set output_grid[r][c] to 7.
  secondary_observations: # Rules potentially needed to explain anomalies
    - Possible rule: If a bounded shape contains only 5s (no 7s) in the input, all 5s in that shape might change to 7s in the output.
    - Unexplained changes: Some 5->7 changes occur without apparent input 7 neighbors. Other changes (9->0, 0->6, 0->7) occur in some examples.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Cells are neighbors if they share an edge or a corner.
  - Containment: Cells belong to shapes.
  - Input-Output Mapping: Each cell in the output potentially derives its value from the corresponding cell and its neighbors in the input.
