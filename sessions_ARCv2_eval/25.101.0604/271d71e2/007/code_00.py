"""
Transforms an input grid based on a sequence of rules:
1. Identify connected regions of only 5s in the input and change them to 7s.
2. Iteratively propagate 7s to adjacent 5s until no more changes occur.
3. Revert cells that were originally 5 but became 7 back to 5 if they are adjacent to an input 0.
4. Apply specific boundary pattern replacements based on the input grid (e.g., copying rows, replacing segments).
5. Apply specific single-cell anomaly fixes based on the input grid.
