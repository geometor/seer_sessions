            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code (`code_00.py`) implemented a two-phase rule: (1) Change flanked 0s to 1s (bridging), (2) Change *all* original 1s to 0s (cleaning). This worked perfectly for Example 3 but failed on Examples 1 and 2.\n\n*   **Example 1 Failure:** The code incorrectly changed *all* input 1s to 0s. The expected output shows that input 1s adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to a '3' should *remain* 1s, while other input 1s become 0s.\n*   **Example 2 Failure:** The code failed significantly. The \"bridging\" part (0->1) in the expected output is much more extensive than simple flanking suggests, resembling a fill operation. The \"cleaning\" part (1->0) also differs; many input 1s remain 1s in the output, seemingly those connected to the main structure involving '3's and '5's or participating in the filled '1' areas. The simple flanking and universal 1->0 rules are inadequate here.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine the Rule Based on Examples 1 and 3:** Develop a rule that correctly handles the conditional transformation of input 1s observed in Example 1, while still satisfying Example 3. The key insight is that input 1s only change to 0s if they are *not* adjacent (using 8-directional adjacency) to an input cell with value 3.\n2.  **Acknowledge Example 2 Anomaly:** Recognize that the rule derived from Examples 1 and 3 does not explain Example 2. Example 2 likely follows a different logic, possibly involving region filling triggered by the presence of color '5' or specific configurations of '3's.\n3.  **Implement the Refined Rule:** Update the natural language program and code to reflect the refined bridging and conditional cleaning logic based on adjacency to '3'.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nBased on the **Refined Strategy (Bridging + Conditional Cleaning based on adjacency to 3)**:\n\n| Example | Previous Code Pixels Off | Previous Code Score | Predicted New Pixels Off | Predicted New Score | Match Expected? | Notes                                                                 |\n| :------ | :----------------------- | :------------------ | :----------------------- | :------------------ | :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **1**   | 16                       | 32.0                | 0                        | 0.0                 | Yes             | New rule correctly keeps 1s near 3s and changes others to 0s.         |\n| **2**   | 25                       | 50.0                | >20 (Estimate)           | >40 (Estimate)      | No              | New rule still fails significantly; expected output follows a different pattern. |\n| **3**   | 0                        | 0.0                 | 0                        | 0.0                 | Yes             | New rule works: no 3s present, so all input 1s correctly become 0s. |\n\nThe refined rule is expected to solve Examples 1 and 3 perfectly but will still fail on Example 2.\n\n## Facts\n\n```yaml\ntask_type: grid_transformation\ngrid_properties:\n  dimensionality: 2\n  cell_values: integers (0-9)\n  size: 10x10 (consistent)\nobjects:\n  - name: cell\n    properties:\n      - value: integer (color)\n      - position: (row, column)\n  - name: grid\n    properties:\n      - cells: collection of cell objects\nrelationships:\n  - type: adjacency\n    between: cell, cell\n    properties:\n      - direction: orthogonal (North, South, East, West) for flanking\n      - direction: 8-directional (Ortho + Diagonal) for support check\n  - type: flanking\n    definition: A cell C at (r, c) is flanked horizontally if input[r][c-1] == input[r][c+1] == X, where X != 0.

Initialize an empty set called `bridge_locations` to store the coordinates `(r, c)` of cells that will become 1 due to flanking.\n2.  Get the dimensions (`rows`, `cols`) of the `input_grid`.\n3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the `input_grid`.\n4.  If `input_grid[r][c]` is 0:\n    *   Check for horizontal flanking: If `c > 0`, `c < cols - 1`, `input_grid[r][c-1] != 0`, and `input_grid[r][c-1] == input_grid[r][c+1]`, add `(r, c)` to `bridge_locations`.\n    *   Check for vertical flanking: Else if `r > 0`, `r < rows - 1`, `input_grid[r-1][c] != 0`, and `input_grid[r-1][c] == input_grid[r+1][c]`, add `(r, c)` to `bridge_locations`.\n5.  Create the `output_grid`, initially as a deep copy of the `input_grid`.\n6.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the `input_grid` again.\n7.  If `(r, c)` is in `bridge_locations`:\n    *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 1`.\n8.  Else if `input_grid[r][c]` is 1:\n    *   Initialize a flag `is_supported = False`.\n    *   Iterate through all 8 neighbors `(nr, nc)` of `(r, c)`:\n        *   Check if the neighbor `(nr, nc)` is within the grid bounds.\n        *   If the neighbor is within bounds and `input_grid[nr][nc] == 3`, set `is_supported = True` and break the inner neighbor loop.\n    *   If `is_supported` is `True`, set `output_grid[r][c] = 1`.\n    *   Else (if `is_supported` is `False`), set `output_grid[r][c] = 0`.\n9.  Else (the cell was not a bridge point and not originally 1):\n    *   The value remains as copied from the `input_grid`.\n10. Return the `output_grid`."
