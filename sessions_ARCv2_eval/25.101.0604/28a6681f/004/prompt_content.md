```python
"""
Transforms a 2D grid based on a two-phase process:
1. Identification Phase: Identifies 'bridge' locations. A cell at (r, c) is a bridge location if its value in the input grid is 0 and it is flanked either horizontally or vertically by identical non-zero neighbors in the input grid.
2. Construction Phase: Creates the output grid.
    - If a cell position was identified as a bridge location, its value in the output grid is 1.
    - If a cell's value in the input grid was 1 and it was *not* a bridge location, its value in the output grid becomes 0.
    - Otherwise, the cell retains its original value from the input grid.
