## General Assessment

The previous execution (`code_00.py`) implemented a rule involving flanking for 0s and neighbor checking (value 3) for 1s. This passed Example 3 but failed Examples 1 and 2.

Analysis of the failures, particularly in Example 1, revealed that the simple neighbor check for preserving '1's was incorrect. The expected output suggests a dependency on connectivity:
*   Input cells with value '1' seem to persist in the output only if they are part of a larger connected component (using 8-way adjacency on non-zero cells) that also contains a cell with value '2' or '3'.
*   Input cells with value '1' that are in connected components *without* any '2's or '3's are changed to '0'.
*   The rule for changing flanked '0's to '1's (bridging) appears consistent across Examples 1 and 3.

This "Connectivity Hypothesis" successfully explains the transformations in both Example 1 and Example 3.

Example 2 remains anomalous. Its transformation doesn't fit the simple bridging rule (it seems to fill regions) nor the connectivity-based cleaning rule for 1s. The presence of value '5' and the different structure likely trigger a distinct transformation logic not captured by the pattern in Examples 1 and 3.

**Strategy:**

1.  Implement the "Connectivity Hypothesis" as derived from Examples 1 and 3.
2.  Acknowledge that this rule is expected to fail on Example 2.
3.  Refine the Facts YAML and Natural Language Program to describe this connectivity-based logic accurately.

## Metrics Analysis

Simulating the "Connectivity Hypothesis" rule:

1.  **Bridging:** Identify input 0s flanked H or V by identical non-zero values. Mark these as bridge points.
    *   Ex1: (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (8,6)
    *   Ex3: (7,4), (8,1), (8,4)
2.  **Connectivity:** Find connected components of non-zero cells (8-way adjacency) in the input. Identify "main components" as those containing any cell with value 2 or 3.
    *   Ex1: One main component containing all 2s, 3s, and the 1s in rows 2-9. A separate component for 1s in rows 0-1.
    *   Ex3: One main component containing the 2s at the bottom. Other components (9s, 1s, 4s) are separate.
3.  **Output Construction:**
    *   Bridge points become 1.
    *   Input 1s become 1 if in a main component, else 0.
    *   Other input cells (0s not bridged, 2s, 3s, 4s, etc.) keep their value.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create an empty set `bridge_locations` to store coordinates `(r, c)`. Get grid dimensions (`rows`, `cols`).
2.  **Identify Bridges:** Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the `input_grid`. If `input_grid[r][c]` is 0, check for flanking:
    *   Horizontal: If `c > 0`, `c < cols - 1`, `input_grid[r][c-1] != 0`, and `input_grid[r][c-1] == input_grid[r][c+1]`, add `(r, c)` to `bridge_locations`.
    *   Vertical: Else if `r > 0`, `r < rows - 1`, `input_grid[r-1][c] != 0`, and `input_grid[r-1][c] == input_grid[r+1][c]`, add `(r, c)` to `bridge_locations`.
3.  **Analyze Connectivity:**
    *   Initialize data structures to track visited cells and component memberships (e.g., a dictionary `cell_to_component_info` mapping `(r, c)` to `{'component_id': id, 'is_main': False}`).
    *   Initialize `component_id_counter = 0`.
    *   Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the `input_grid`.
    *   If `input_grid[r][c]` is not 0 AND `(r, c)` has not been visited yet:
        *   Start a search (e.g., Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) from `(r, c)` to find all reachable non-zero cells using 8-directional adjacency.
        *   Keep track of all cells found in this component in a temporary list `current_component_cells`.
        *   Initialize a flag `component_is_main = False`.
        *   During the search, mark each visited cell `(nr, nc)` and check if `input_grid[nr][nc]` is 2 or 3. If it is, set `component_is_main = True`.
        *   After the search finishes for this component, assign the current `component_id_counter` and the `component_is_main` status to all cells in `current_component_cells` within the `cell_to_component_info` map.
        *   Increment `component_id_counter`.
4.  **Construct Output Grid:**
    *   Create the `output_grid`, initially as a deep copy of the `input_grid`.
    *   Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the `output_grid`.
    *   If `(r, c)` is in `bridge_locations`:
        *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 1`.
    *   Else if `input_grid[r][c] == 1`:
        *   Look up `(r, c)` in `cell_to_component_info`.
        *   If the corresponding component `is_main` flag is `True`:
            *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 1`.
        *   Else (component `is_main` flag is `False`):
            *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 0`.
    *   Else (cell was not a bridge, not originally 1):
        *   The value from the initial copy remains correct (`output_grid[r][c] = input_grid[r][c]`).
5.  **Return:** Return the final `output_grid`.
