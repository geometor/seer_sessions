```python
"""
Transforms a 2D grid based on a two-phase process derived from examples 1 and 3:
1. Identification Phase: Identifies 'bridge' locations. A cell at (r, c) is a bridge location if its value in the input grid is 0 and it is flanked either horizontally or vertically by identical non-zero neighbors in the input grid.
2. Construction Phase: Creates the output grid.
    - If a cell position was identified as a bridge location, its value in the output grid is 1.
    - If a cell's value in the input grid was 1:
        - It remains 1 if any of its 8 neighbors (orthogonally or diagonally) in the input grid has the value 3.
        - It becomes 0 otherwise.
    - Otherwise (cell was not 0, not 1, or was 0 but not a bridge), the cell retains its original value from the input grid.
This rule may not correctly handle Example 2, which appears to follow different logic.
