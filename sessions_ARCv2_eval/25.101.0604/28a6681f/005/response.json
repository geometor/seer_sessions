A cell at (r, c) is a bridge location if its value in the input grid is 0 and it is flanked either horizontally or vertically by identical non-zero neighbors in the input grid.\n2. Construction Phase: Creates the output grid.\n    - If a cell position was identified as a bridge location, its value in the output grid is 1.\n    - If a cell's value in the input grid was 1:\n        - It remains 1 if any of its 8 neighbors (orthogonally or diagonally) in the input grid has the value 3.\n        - It becomes 0 otherwise.\n    - Otherwise (cell was not 0, not 1, or was 0 but not a bridge), the cell retains its original value from the input grid.\nThis rule may not correctly handle Example 2, which appears to follow different logic.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport copy\n\ndef has_neighbor_value(grid: list[list[int]], r: int, c: int, value: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if any of the 8 neighbors of cell (r, c) has the specified value.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input grid.\n        r: Row index of the cell.\n        c: Column index of the cell.\n        value: The value to check for in neighbors.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if a neighbor with the specified value exists, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            # Skip the cell itself\n            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            \n            # Check bounds\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                if grid[nr][nc] == value:\n                    return True\n    return False\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:  \n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the refined two-phase transformation rule to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Get grid dimensions\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    if rows == 0:\n        return [] # Handle empty grid case\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n    if cols == 0:\n        return [[] for _ in range(rows)] # Handle empty row case\n\n    # --- Phase 1: Identify Bridge Locations ---\n    bridge_locations = set()\n    # Iterate through each cell to check for flanking conditions\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Check if the current cell value in the input grid is 0\n            if input_grid[r][c] == 0:\n                # Check for horizontal flanking\n                # Ensure neighbors are within bounds\n                if c > 0 and c < cols - 1:\n                    left_neighbor_val = input_grid[r][c-1]\n                    right_neighbor_val = input_grid[r][c+1]\n                    # Check if neighbors are identical and non-zero\n                    if left_neighbor_val != 0 and left_neighbor_val == right_neighbor_val:\n                        bridge_locations.add((r, c))\n                        continue # Found a horizontal bridge, move to next cell\n\n                # Check for vertical flanking (only if horizontal condition was not met)\n                # Ensure neighbors are within bounds\n                if r > 0 and r < rows - 1:\n                    top_neighbor_val = input_grid[r-1][c]\n                    bottom_neighbor_val = input_grid[r+1][c]\n                    # Check if neighbors are identical and non-zero\n                    if top_neighbor_val != 0 and top_neighbor_val == bottom_neighbor_val:\n                        bridge_locations.add((r, c))\n                        # No continue needed here as it's the last check for this cell\n                        \n    # --- Phase 2: Construct Output Grid ---\n    # Initialize output_grid as a deep copy of the input grid\n    # This handles Rule 3 (keeping original values) by default\n    output_grid = copy.deepcopy(input_grid)\n\n    # Iterate through each cell to apply the construction rules\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Rule 1: If it's a bridge location, set output to 1\n            if (r, c) in bridge_locations:\n                output_grid[r][c] = 1\n            # Rule 2: Else if the original value was 1\n            elif input_grid[r][c] == 1:\n                # Check if it's 'supported' by a neighbor with value 3 in the input grid\n                if has_neighbor_value(input_grid, r, c, 3):\n                    output_grid[r][c] = 1 # Keep it as 1\n                else:\n                    output_grid[r][c] = 0 # Change it to 0\n            # Rule 3 (Else): Cell wasn't a bridge and wasn't originally 1.\n            # The value is already correct due to the initial deepcopy.
