*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a 2D grid of numbers (colors). The core transformation observed in all examples is changing certain cells with value 0 to value 1. Cells with other non-zero values remain unchanged. The specific locations where the 0s change to 1s seem dependent on the values of their immediate orthogonal neighbors in the input grid. Examples 1 and 3 show a clear pattern where a 0 changes to a 1 if it is directly between two identical non-zero numbers either horizontally (left/right neighbors are the same and non-zero) or vertically (top/bottom neighbors are the same and non-zero). Example 2 also involves 0s changing to 1s, but the pattern doesn't consistently fit the rule observed in examples 1 and 3. Specifically, some 0s change without being flanked by identical non-zero neighbors, and one 0 that *is* flanked vertically by identical non-zero neighbors (1s) does *not* change. However, the rule identified in examples 1 and 3 is the most consistent pattern observed.

*   **Facts:**
    ```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    grid_properties:
      dimensionality: 2
      cell_values: integers (0-9)
      size: 10x10 (consistent across examples)
    objects:
      - name: cell
        properties:
          - value: integer (color)
          - position: (row, column)
      - name: grid
        properties:
          - cells: collection of cell objects
    relationships:
      - type: adjacency
        between: cell, cell
        properties:
          - direction: orthogonal (North, South, East, West)
          - definition: cells sharing an edge
      - type: flanking
        definition: A cell is flanked horizontally if its West and East neighbors exist and have identical non-zero values. A cell is flanked vertically if its North and South neighbors exist and have identical non-zero values.
    transformation:
      action: change_cell_value
      target_object: cell
      input_condition: cell value is 0
      rule_condition: The cell is flanked either horizontally or vertically by identical non-zero values in the input grid.
      output_value: 1
      fallback_action: keep original cell value if conditions are not met
    uncertainties:
      - Example train_2 does not fully conform to the identified flanking rule. Some cells change without meeting the condition, and one cell meets the condition but does not change. This suggests either a refinement to the rule or a conditional application based on other grid properties specific to train_2 (like the presence of color 5) might be needed, but the core flanking rule works for train_1 and train_3.
    ```

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each cell `C` at position (row, column) in the input grid.
    3.  Check if the value of cell `C` in the input grid is 0.
    4.  If the value is 0, then check its orthogonal neighbors:
        *   Check the West neighbor (row, column-1) and East neighbor (row, column+1). If both neighbors exist, are non-zero, and have the *same* value, then change the value of cell `C` at (row, column) in the output grid to 1.
        *   Else, check the North neighbor (row-1, column) and South neighbor (row+1, column). If both neighbors exist, are non-zero, and have the *same* value, then change the value of cell `C` at (row, column) in the output grid to 1.
    5.  If the value of cell `C` is not 0, or if it is 0 but neither the horizontal nor vertical flanking condition is met, keep its original value in the output grid.
    6.  Return the final output grid.

## General Assessment

The initial code implemented a rule where cells with value 0 change to 1 if they are orthogonally flanked by identical non-zero values. This rule correctly identified the cells changing from 0 to 1 in examples 1 and 3. However, the code failed because it did not account for another transformation: cells that originally have the value 1 in the input are changed to 0 in the output.

The test results highlight this second transformation:
*   **Example 1 & 3:** The code correctly changed flanked 0s to 1s, but failed because it left the original input 1s unchanged, whereas the expected output changed them to 0s.
*   **Example 2:** This example presents a more complex scenario. The initial code's output (as reported) did not match the expected output significantly. Firstly, it missed changing several flanked 0s to 1s (potentially an error in the reported execution trace, as the code logic *should* have caught more). Secondly, like in Ex1 & 3, it failed to change original 1s to 0s. Thirdly, the *expected* output for Ex2 shows some original 1s *remaining* as 1, and some 0s changing to 1 even when *not* flanked according to the simple rule.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Adopt a Two-Phase Rule:** The most consistent pattern across Ex1 and Ex3 is a two-phase process:
    *   **Phase 1: Bridging:** Identify input cells with value 0 that are flanked horizontally or vertically by identical non-zero values. Mark these locations.
    *   **Phase 2: Construction/Cleaning:** Construct the output grid. If a location was marked as a bridge point in Phase 1, its output value is 1. If a cell had value 1 in the *input* and was *not* marked as a bridge point, its output value becomes 0. All other cells retain their original input value.
2.  **Address Example 2 Anomaly:** This two-phase rule (Hypothesis 5 from internal thought process) perfectly explains examples 1 and 3. It does *not* fully explain example 2. For the purpose of defining the most generally applicable rule based on the *majority* of evidence, we will formulate the natural language program based on Hypothesis 5. The discrepancy in Example 2 suggests either a more complex rule is needed (perhaps involving connectivity, specific color interactions, or location exceptions like row indices) or that Example 2 represents a variation or edge case not covered by the primary rule observed in Ex1 and Ex3. For now, we proceed with the rule derived from Ex1 and Ex3.

## Metrics Analysis (Based on Hypothesis 5)

Let's re-evaluate the expected transformations based on the refined two-phase hypothesis (Bridge + Clean).

*   **Phase 1: Identify Bridge Points (Input 0 flanked H or V by identical non-zeros)**
    *   Ex1: (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (8,6)
    *   Ex2: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (7,6), (8,6)
    *   Ex3: (7,4), (8,1)
*   **Phase 2: Construct Output**
    *   Set Bridge Points -> 1
    *   Set Original Input 1s -> 0
    *   Keep Others

**Example 1:**
*   Input 0s -> 1s: (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (8,6) = 4 changes.
*   Input 1s -> 0s: (0,8), (0,9), (1,8), (1,9) = 4 changes.
*   Total Pixels Changed: 8
*   Predicted Output (Hypothesis 5): Matches Expected Output exactly.
*   Initial Code Mismatch: Failed to change the 4 original 1s to 0s. (4 pixels off).

**Example 2:**
*   Input 0s -> 1s (Rule): (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (7,6), (8,6) = 8 changes.
*   Input 1s -> 0s (Rule): All original 1s in input = 26 changes.
*   Total Pixels Changed (Rule): 34
*   Predicted Output (Hypothesis 5):
    ```
    0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Bridge (2,3)
    0 0 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Bridge (3,3)
    0 0 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Bridge (4,3)
    0 0 3 1 0 3 0 0 0 0  <- Bridge (5,3)
    0 0 3 1 1 3 5 0 0 5  <- Bridge (6,3),(6,4)
    0 0 3 0 0 3 1 0 0 5  <- Bridge (7,6)
    0 0 3 0 0 3 1 0 0 5  <- Bridge (8,6)
    0 0 3 3 3 3 5 5 5 5
    ```
*   Expected Output:
    ```
    0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    0 0 3 1 1 3 1 1 1 1
    0 0 3 1 1 3 5 1 1 5
    0 0 3 1 1 3 5 1 1 5
    0 0 3 1 1 3 5 1 1 5
    0 0 3 3 3 3 5 5 5 5
    ```
*   Mismatch (Hypothesis 5 vs Expected): Significant differences. Rule predicts 1s at (2,3),(3,3) where expected is 0. Rule predicts 0s for many original 1s in rows 4-8 where expected keeps 1s. Rule predicts 0s at (4,4),(4,5),(5,4) where expected has 1s.
*   Initial Code Mismatch: The initial code output (as reported in the prompt) was also significantly different, missing most bridge points and all cleaning operations. Calculating pixel difference requires the *actual* initial code output, but the mismatch score was 14.

**Example 3:**
*   Input 0s -> 1s: (7,4), (8,1) = 2 changes.
*   Input 1s -> 0s: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,7), (3,3), (3,7), (4,3), (4,6), (4,7), (5,6), (5,7) = 11 changes.
*   Total Pixels Changed: 13
*   Predicted Output (Hypothesis 5): Matches Expected Output exactly.
*   Initial Code Mismatch: Failed to change the 11 original 1s to 0s. (Reported 3 pixels off - this seems inconsistent, maybe some 1s were matched by chance? (1,2)=1->0, (1,3)=1->0, (2,3)=1->0. Yes, 3 pixels needed 1->0 change).

  - type: flanking
    definition: A cell C at (r, c) is flanked horizontally if input[r][c-1] == input[r][c+1] == X, where X != 0. It is flanked vertically if input[r-1][c] == input[r+1][c] == Y, where Y != 0.

          - target: Cells C where input_grid[C.position] == 0.
          - condition: Cell C is flanked horizontally OR vertically in the input_grid.
          - action: Mark C.position as a 'bridge_location'.
      - phase_2_construct_output:
          - initialize: output_grid conceptually empty.
          - iterate: through each cell position (r, c).
          - rule_1: IF (r, c) is marked as 'bridge_location', THEN output_grid[r][c] = 1.
          - rule_2: ELIF input_grid[r][c] == 1, THEN output_grid[r][c] = 0.
          - rule_3: ELSE output_grid[r][c] = input_grid[r][c]. # Handles non-zero/non-one values and non-flanked zeros.
observations:
  - note: This rule fully explains examples 1 and 3.
  - anomaly: Example 2's expected output does not conform perfectly to this rule. Specifically, some bridge points identified by phase 1 do not become 1, some input 1s are not changed to 0, and some 0s become 1 without being identified as bridge points by the simple flanking rule. The general rule might need refinement or conditional logic based on Example 2's specific features (e.g., row indices, color values like '5', connectivity).
```

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty set or boolean grid called `bridge_locations` to store the coordinates of cells that will become bridges.
2.  Iterate through each cell `C` at position `(r, c)` in the input grid, excluding border rows/columns where flanking checks are impossible.
3.  Check if the value of cell `C` in the `input_grid` is 0.
4.  If the value is 0, check for flanking:
    *   Check horizontal neighbors: If `c > 0` and `c < max_col-1`, get the values `L = input_grid[r][c-1]` and `R = input_grid[r][c+1]`. If `L != 0` and `L == R`, mark `(r, c)` by adding it to `bridge_locations`.
    *   Check vertical neighbors: If `(r, c)` was not already marked and `r > 0` and `r < max_row-1`, get the values `N = input_grid[r-1][c]` and `S = input_grid[r+1][c]`. If `N != 0` and `N == S`, mark `(r, c)` by adding it to `bridge_locations`.
5.  Create the `output_grid` (e.g., by copying the `input_grid` initially).
6.  Iterate through each cell position `(r, c)` from `(0, 0)` to `(max_row-1, max_col-1)`.
7.  If the position `(r, c)` exists in `bridge_locations`, set `output_grid[r][c] = 1`.
8.  Else if the value `input_grid[r][c]` is 1, set `output_grid[r][c] = 0`.
9.  Else (the cell was not a bridge point and not originally 1), keep the value from the initial copy: `output_grid[r][c] = input_grid[r][c]`.
10. Return the final `output_grid`.

## General Assessment

The previous code (`code_00.py`) implemented a two-phase rule: (1) Change flanked 0s to 1s (bridging), (2) Change *all* original 1s to 0s (cleaning). This worked perfectly for Example 3 but failed on Examples 1 and 2.

*   **Example 1 Failure:** The code incorrectly changed *all* input 1s to 0s. The expected output shows that input 1s adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to a '3' should *remain* 1s, while other input 1s become 0s.
*   **Example 2 Failure:** The code failed significantly. The "bridging" part (0->1) in the expected output is much more extensive than simple flanking suggests, resembling a fill operation. The "cleaning" part (1->0) also differs; many input 1s remain 1s in the output, seemingly those connected to the main structure involving '3's and '5's or participating in the filled '1' areas. The simple flanking and universal 1->0 rules are inadequate here.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine the Rule Based on Examples 1 and 3:** Develop a rule that correctly handles the conditional transformation of input 1s observed in Example 1, while still satisfying Example 3. The key insight is that input 1s only change to 0s if they are *not* adjacent (using 8-directional adjacency) to an input cell with value 3.
2.  **Acknowledge Example 2 Anomaly:** Recognize that the rule derived from Examples 1 and 3 does not explain Example 2. Example 2 likely follows a different logic, possibly involving region filling triggered by the presence of color '5' or specific configurations of '3's.
3.  **Implement the Refined Rule:** Update the natural language program and code to reflect the refined bridging and conditional cleaning logic based on adjacency to '3'.

## Metrics Analysis

Based on the **Refined Strategy (Bridging + Conditional Cleaning based on adjacency to 3)**:

| Example | Previous Code Pixels Off | Previous Code Score | Predicted New Pixels Off | Predicted New Score | Match Expected? | Notes                                                                 |
| :------ | :----------------------- | :------------------ | :----------------------- | :------------------ | :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**   | 16                       | 32.0                | 0                        | 0.0                 | Yes             | New rule correctly keeps 1s near 3s and changes others to 0s.         |
| **2**   | 25                       | 50.0                | >20 (Estimate)           | >40 (Estimate)      | No              | New rule still fails significantly; expected output follows a different pattern. |
| **3**   | 0                        | 0.0                 | 0                        | 0.0                 | Yes             | New rule works: no 3s present, so all input 1s correctly become 0s. |

The refined rule is expected to solve Examples 1 and 3 perfectly but will still fail on Example 2.

    properties:

  - type: flanking
    definition: A cell C at (r, c) is flanked horizontally if input[r][c-1] == input[r][c+1] == X, where X != 0. It is flanked vertically if input[r-1][c] == input[r+1][c] == Y, where Y != 0.
  - type: support
    definition: An input cell C at (r, c) with value 1 is considered 'supported' if any of its 8 neighbors in the input grid has the value 3.

  - name: transform_grid
    inputs: input_grid (grid object)

    rule:
      - description: Two-phase transformation based on input grid structure, primarily derived from Examples 1 and 3.
      - phase_1_identify_bridges:
          - target: Cells C where input_grid[C.position] == 0.
          - condition: Cell C is flanked horizontally OR vertically in the input_grid.
          - action: Mark C.position as a 'bridge_location'.
      - phase_2_construct_output:

          - iterate: through each cell position (r, c).
          - rule_1: IF (r, c) is marked as 'bridge_location', THEN output_grid[r][c] = 1.
          - rule_2: ELIF input_grid[r][c] == 1:
              - check_condition: Is the cell at (r, c) 'supported' (has a neighbor with value 3 in the input grid)?
              - if_supported: THEN output_grid[r][c] = 1.
              - if_not_supported: THEN output_grid[r][c] = 0.
          - rule_3: ELSE output_grid[r][c] = input_grid[r][c]. # Handles non-zero/non-one values and non-flanked zeros.
observations:
  - note: This rule accurately describes the transformations in Examples 1 and 3.
  - anomaly: Example 2 exhibits a different pattern. The 0->1 transformation appears more like a region fill, and the 1->0/1->1 transformation might depend on adjacency to 3s and 5s or inclusion in the filled region. The current rule derived from Ex1/Ex3 does not explain Ex2.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty set called `bridge_locations` to store the coordinates `(r, c)` of cells that will become 1 due to flanking.
2.  Get the dimensions (`rows`, `cols`) of the `input_grid`.
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the `input_grid`.
4.  If `input_grid[r][c]` is 0:
    *   Check for horizontal flanking: If `c > 0`, `c < cols - 1`, `input_grid[r][c-1] != 0`, and `input_grid[r][c-1] == input_grid[r][c+1]`, add `(r, c)` to `bridge_locations`.
    *   Check for vertical flanking: Else if `r > 0`, `r < rows - 1`, `input_grid[r-1][c] != 0`, and `input_grid[r-1][c] == input_grid[r+1][c]`, add `(r, c)` to `bridge_locations`.
5.  Create the `output_grid`, initially as a deep copy of the `input_grid`.
6.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the `input_grid` again.
7.  If `(r, c)` is in `bridge_locations`:
    *   Set `output_grid[r][c] = 1`.
8.  Else if `input_grid[r][c]` is 1:
    *   Initialize a flag `is_supported = False`.
    *   Iterate through all 8 neighbors `(nr, nc)` of `(r, c)`:
        *   Check if the neighbor `(nr, nc)` is within the grid bounds.
        *   If the neighbor is within bounds and `input_grid[nr][nc] == 3`, set `is_supported = True` and break the inner neighbor loop.
    *   If `is_supported` is `True`, set `output_grid[r][c] = 1`.
    *   Else (if `is_supported` is `False`), set `output_grid[r][c] = 0`.
9.  Else (the cell was not a bridge point and not originally 1):
    *   The value remains as copied from the `input_grid`.
10. Return the `output_grid`.
