            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code implemented a rule where cells with value 0 change to 1 if they are orthogonally flanked by identical non-zero values. This rule correctly identified the cells changing from 0 to 1 in examples 1 and 3. However, the code failed because it did not account for another transformation: cells that originally have the value 1 in the input are changed to 0 in the output.\n\nThe test results highlight this second transformation:\n*   **Example 1 & 3:** The code correctly changed flanked 0s to 1s, but failed because it left the original input 1s unchanged, whereas the expected output changed them to 0s.\n*   **Example 2:** This example presents a more complex scenario. The initial code's output (as reported) did not match the expected output significantly. Firstly, it missed changing several flanked 0s to 1s (potentially an error in the reported execution trace, as the code logic *should* have caught more). Secondly, like in Ex1 & 3, it failed to change original 1s to 0s. Thirdly, the *expected* output for Ex2 shows some original 1s *remaining* as 1, and some 0s changing to 1 even when *not* flanked according to the simple rule.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Adopt a Two-Phase Rule:** The most consistent pattern across Ex1 and Ex3 is a two-phase process:\n    *   **Phase 1: Bridging:** Identify input cells with value 0 that are flanked horizontally or vertically by identical non-zero values. Mark these locations.\n    *   **Phase 2: Construction/Cleaning:** Construct the output grid. If a location was marked as a bridge point in Phase 1, its output value is 1. If a cell had value 1 in the *input* and was *not* marked as a bridge point, its output value becomes 0. All other cells retain their original input value.\n2.  **Address Example 2 Anomaly:** This two-phase rule (Hypothesis 5 from internal thought process) perfectly explains examples 1 and 3. It does *not* fully explain example 2. For the purpose of defining the most generally applicable rule based on the *majority* of evidence, we will formulate the natural language program based on Hypothesis 5. The discrepancy in Example 2 suggests either a more complex rule is needed (perhaps involving connectivity, specific color interactions, or location exceptions like row indices) or that Example 2 represents a variation or edge case not covered by the primary rule observed in Ex1 and Ex3. For now, we proceed with the rule derived from Ex1 and Ex3.\n\n## Metrics Analysis (Based on Hypothesis 5)\n\nLet's re-evaluate the expected transformations based on the refined two-phase hypothesis (Bridge + Clean).\n\n**Code Execution Simulation (Mental Walkthrough of Hypothesis 5):**\n\n*   **Phase 1: Identify Bridge Points (Input 0 flanked H or V by identical non-zeros)**\n    *   Ex1: (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (8,6)\n    *   Ex2: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (7,6), (8,6)\n    *   Ex3: (7,4), (8,1)\n*   **Phase 2: Construct Output**\n    *   Set Bridge Points -> 1\n    *   Set Original Input 1s -> 0\n    *   Keep Others\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input 0s -> 1s: (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (8,6) = 4 changes.\n*   Input 1s -> 0s: (0,8), (0,9), (1,8), (1,9) = 4 changes.\n*   Total Pixels Changed: 8\n*   Predicted Output (Hypothesis 5): Matches Expected Output exactly.\n*   Initial Code Mismatch: Failed to change the 4 original 1s to 0s. (4 pixels off).\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input 0s -> 1s (Rule): (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (7,6), (8,6) = 8 changes.\n*   Input 1s -> 0s (Rule): All original 1s in input = 26 changes.\n*   Total Pixels Changed (Rule): 34\n*   Predicted Output (Hypothesis 5):\n    ```\n    0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    0 0 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Bridge (2,3)\n    0 0 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Bridge (3,3)\n    0 0 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Bridge (4,3)\n    0 0 3 1 0 3 0 0 0 0  <- Bridge (5,3)\n    0 0 3 1 1 3 5 0 0 5  <- Bridge (6,3),(6,4)\n    0 0 3 0 0 3 1 0 0 5  <- Bridge (7,6)\n    0 0 3 0 0 3 1 0 0 5  <- Bridge (8,6)\n    0 0 3 3 3 3 5 5 5 5\n    ```\n*   Expected Output:\n    ```\n    0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    0 0 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    0 0 3 1 1 3 1 1 1 1\n    0 0 3 1 1 3 5 1 1 5\n    0 0 3 1 1 3 5 1 1 5\n    0 0 3 1 1 3 5 1 1 5\n    0 0 3 3 3 3 5 5 5 5\n    ```\n*   Mismatch (Hypothesis 5 vs Expected): Significant differences. Rule predicts 1s at (2,3),(3,3) where expected is 0. Rule predicts 0s for many original 1s in rows 4-8 where expected keeps 1s. Rule predicts 0s at (4,4),(4,5),(5,4) where expected has 1s.\n*   Initial Code Mismatch: The initial code output (as reported in the prompt) was also significantly different, missing most bridge points and all cleaning operations. Calculating pixel difference requires the *actual* initial code output, but the mismatch score was 14.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input 0s -> 1s: (7,4), (8,1) = 2 changes.\n*   Input 1s -> 0s: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,7), (3,3), (3,7), (4,3), (4,6), (4,7), (5,6), (5,7) = 11 changes.\n*   Total Pixels Changed: 13\n*   Predicted Output (Hypothesis 5): Matches Expected Output exactly.\n*   Initial Code Mismatch: Failed to change the 11 original 1s to 0s. (Reported 3 pixels off - this seems inconsistent, maybe some 1s were matched by chance? (1,2)=1->0, (1,3)=1->0, (2,3)=1->0. Yes, 3 pixels needed 1->0 change).\n\n## Facts\n\n```yaml\ntask_type: grid_transformation\ngrid_properties:\n  dimensionality: 2\n  cell_values: integers (0-9)\n  size: 10x10\nobjects:\n  - name: cell\n    properties:\n      - value: integer (color)\n      - position: (row, column)\n  - name: grid\n    properties:\n      - cells: collection of cell objects\nrelationships:\n  - type: adjacency\n    between: cell, cell\n    properties:\n      - direction: orthogonal (North, South, East, West)\n  - type: flanking\n    definition: A cell C at (r, c) is flanked horizontally if input[r][c-1] == input[r][c+1] == X, where X != 0.

Specifically, some bridge points identified by phase 1 do not become 1, some input 1s are not changed to 0, and some 0s become 1 without being identified as bridge points by the simple flanking rule. The general rule might need refinement or conditional logic based on Example 2's specific features (e.g., row indices, color values like '5', connectivity).\n```\n\n## Natural Language Program\n\n1.  Initialize an empty set or boolean grid called `bridge_locations` to store the coordinates of cells that will become bridges.\n2.  Iterate through each cell `C` at position `(r, c)` in the input grid, excluding border rows/columns where flanking checks are impossible.\n3.  Check if the value of cell `C` in the `input_grid` is 0.\n4.  If the value is 0, check for flanking:\n    *   Check horizontal neighbors: If `c > 0` and `c < max_col-1`, get the values `L = input_grid[r][c-1]` and `R = input_grid[r][c+1]`. If `L != 0` and `L == R`, mark `(r, c)` by adding it to `bridge_locations`.\n    *   Check vertical neighbors: If `(r, c)` was not already marked and `r > 0` and `r < max_row-1`, get the values `N = input_grid[r-1][c]` and `S = input_grid[r+1][c]`. If `N != 0` and `N == S`, mark `(r, c)` by adding it to `bridge_locations`.\n5.  Create the `output_grid` (e.g., by copying the `input_grid` initially).\n6.  Iterate through each cell position `(r, c)` from `(0, 0)` to `(max_row-1, max_col-1)`.\n7.  If the position `(r, c)` exists in `bridge_locations`, set `output_grid[r][c] = 1`.\n8.  Else if the value `input_grid[r][c]` is 1, set `output_grid[r][c] = 0`.\n9.  Else (the cell was not a bridge point and not originally 1), keep the value from the initial copy: `output_grid[r][c] = input_grid[r][c]`.\n10. Return the final `output_grid`."
