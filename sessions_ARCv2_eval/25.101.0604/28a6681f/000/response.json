The core transformation observed in all examples is changing certain cells with value 0 to value 1. Cells with other non-zero values remain unchanged. The specific locations where the 0s change to 1s seem dependent on the values of their immediate orthogonal neighbors in the input grid. Examples 1 and 3 show a clear pattern where a 0 changes to a 1 if it is directly between two identical non-zero numbers either horizontally (left/right neighbors are the same and non-zero) or vertically (top/bottom neighbors are the same and non-zero). Example 2 also involves 0s changing to 1s, but the pattern doesn't consistently fit the rule observed in examples 1 and 3. Specifically, some 0s change without being flanked by identical non-zero neighbors, and one 0 that *is* flanked vertically by identical non-zero neighbors (1s) does *not* change. However, the rule identified in examples 1 and 3 is the most consistent pattern observed.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    ```yaml\n    task_type: grid_transformation\n    grid_properties:\n      dimensionality: 2\n      cell_values: integers (0-9)\n      size: 10x10 (consistent across examples)\n    objects:\n      - name: cell\n        properties:\n          - value: integer (color)\n          - position: (row, column)\n      - name: grid\n        properties:\n          - cells: collection of cell objects\n    relationships:\n      - type: adjacency\n        between: cell, cell\n        properties:\n          - direction: orthogonal (North, South, East, West)\n          - definition: cells sharing an edge\n      - type: flanking\n        definition: A cell is flanked horizontally if its West and East neighbors exist and have identical non-zero values. A cell is flanked vertically if its North and South neighbors exist and have identical non-zero values.\n    transformation:\n      action: change_cell_value\n      target_object: cell\n      input_condition: cell value is 0\n      rule_condition: The cell is flanked either horizontally or vertically by identical non-zero values in the input grid.\n      output_value: 1\n      fallback_action: keep original cell value if conditions are not met\n    uncertainties:\n      - Example train_2 does not fully conform to the identified flanking rule. Some cells change without meeting the condition, and one cell meets the condition but does not change. This suggests either a refinement to the rule or a conditional application based on other grid properties specific to train_2 (like the presence of color 5) might be needed, but the core flanking rule works for train_1 and train_3.\n    ```\n\n*   **Natural Language Program:**\n    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    2.  Iterate through each cell `C` at position (row, column) in the input grid.\n    3.  Check if the value of cell `C` in the input grid is 0.\n    4.  If the value is 0, then check its orthogonal neighbors:\n        *   Check the West neighbor (row, column-1) and East neighbor (row, column+1). If both neighbors exist, are non-zero, and have the *same* value, then change the value of cell `C` at (row, column) in the output grid to 1.\n        *   Else, check the North neighbor (row-1, column) and South neighbor (row+1, column). If both neighbors exist, are non-zero, and have the *same* value, then change the value of cell `C` at (row, column) in the output grid to 1.\n    5.  If the value of cell `C` is not 0, or if it is 0 but neither the horizontal nor vertical flanking condition is met, keep its original value in the output grid.\n    6.  Return the final output grid."
