*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a 2D grid of numbers (colors). The core transformation observed in all examples is changing certain cells with value 0 to value 1. Cells with other non-zero values remain unchanged. The specific locations where the 0s change to 1s seem dependent on the values of their immediate orthogonal neighbors in the input grid. Examples 1 and 3 show a clear pattern where a 0 changes to a 1 if it is directly between two identical non-zero numbers either horizontally (left/right neighbors are the same and non-zero) or vertically (top/bottom neighbors are the same and non-zero). Example 2 also involves 0s changing to 1s, but the pattern doesn't consistently fit the rule observed in examples 1 and 3. Specifically, some 0s change without being flanked by identical non-zero neighbors, and one 0 that *is* flanked vertically by identical non-zero neighbors (1s) does *not* change. However, the rule identified in examples 1 and 3 is the most consistent pattern observed.

*   **Facts:**
    ```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    grid_properties:
      dimensionality: 2
      cell_values: integers (0-9)
      size: 10x10 (consistent across examples)
    objects:
      - name: cell
        properties:
          - value: integer (color)
          - position: (row, column)
      - name: grid
        properties:
          - cells: collection of cell objects
    relationships:
      - type: adjacency
        between: cell, cell
        properties:
          - direction: orthogonal (North, South, East, West)
          - definition: cells sharing an edge
      - type: flanking
        definition: A cell is flanked horizontally if its West and East neighbors exist and have identical non-zero values. A cell is flanked vertically if its North and South neighbors exist and have identical non-zero values.
    transformation:
      action: change_cell_value
      target_object: cell
      input_condition: cell value is 0
      rule_condition: The cell is flanked either horizontally or vertically by identical non-zero values in the input grid.
      output_value: 1
      fallback_action: keep original cell value if conditions are not met
    uncertainties:
      - Example train_2 does not fully conform to the identified flanking rule. Some cells change without meeting the condition, and one cell meets the condition but does not change. This suggests either a refinement to the rule or a conditional application based on other grid properties specific to train_2 (like the presence of color 5) might be needed, but the core flanking rule works for train_1 and train_3.
    ```

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each cell `C` at position (row, column) in the input grid.
    3.  Check if the value of cell `C` in the input grid is 0.
    4.  If the value is 0, then check its orthogonal neighbors:
        *   Check the West neighbor (row, column-1) and East neighbor (row, column+1). If both neighbors exist, are non-zero, and have the *same* value, then change the value of cell `C` at (row, column) in the output grid to 1.
        *   Else, check the North neighbor (row-1, column) and South neighbor (row+1, column). If both neighbors exist, are non-zero, and have the *same* value, then change the value of cell `C` at (row, column) in the output grid to 1.
    5.  If the value of cell `C` is not 0, or if it is 0 but neither the horizontal nor vertical flanking condition is met, keep its original value in the output grid.
    6.  Return the final output grid.
