objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: varies (e.g., 8x8, 16x16)
      - quadrants: [Q1 (TL), Q2 (TR), Q3 (BL), Q4 (BR)]
      - cells: integer values (0-9)
  - name: Q3 # Bottom-left quadrant
    type: subgrid
    properties:
      - values: set of numbers in the quadrant
      - structure: pattern type (e.g., uniform, checkerboard, rows, complex)
      - non_zero_values: set of non-zero numbers
      - dominant_non_zero: most frequent non-zero number(s)
  - name: Q4 # Bottom-right quadrant
    type: subgrid
    properties:
      - values: set of numbers in the quadrant
      - structure: pattern type (e.g., uniform, checkerboard, border, rows, complex)
      - non_zero_values: set of non-zero numbers
      - dominant_non_zero: most frequent non-zero number(s)
  - name: pattern_quadrant # The more complex of Q3/Q4 (default Q4 if equal)
    type: subgrid_role
  - name: fill_quadrant # The less complex of Q3/Q4 (default Q3 if equal)
    type: subgrid_role
  - name: fill_value # Primary non-zero value from fill_quadrant (0 if none)
    type: integer
  - name: base_tile # Intermediate grid derived before final output construction
    type: grid
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: derived based on transformation rule and input size
      - cells: integer values derived from pattern_quadrant, fill_quadrant, fill_value

actions:
  - name: identify_quadrants
    input: input_grid
    output: Q3, Q4
  - name: determine_roles
    input: Q3, Q4
    output: pattern_quadrant, fill_quadrant (based on complexity)
  - name: extract_fill_value
    input: fill_quadrant
    output: fill_value
  - name: apply_transformation_rule
    input: pattern_quadrant, fill_quadrant, fill_value
    output: output_grid
    logic: Selects and executes specific construction rule based on quadrant properties.

relationships:
  - The output_grid is derived primarily from Q3 and Q4 of the input_grid.
  - The complexity of Q3 and Q4 determines their roles as pattern_quadrant and fill_quadrant.
  - Zeros in the pattern_quadrant are often replaced or combined using values from the fill_quadrant or the single fill_value.
  - Output dimensions depend on the specific rule: copying, tiling (with specific factors), row/column selection/modification.
