## General Assessment

The initial code correctly identified the core concept of using the bottom-left (Q3) and bottom-right (Q4) quadrants, determining a 'pattern' and 'fill' quadrant based on complexity, and applying different rules. However, the execution results reveal errors in the specific implementation of several rules, particularly concerning output dimensions and the exact method of combining or modifying quadrant data.

*   **Rule A (train_4) and Rule E (train_5):** Correctly implemented. These involve simpler transformations (direct copy, zero replacement + row selection).
*   **Rule B (train_1):** The logic identified the correct pattern and fill values but failed to produce the correct output size. The tiling factor was incorrect. The output is 4x the size of the input quadrant, requiring more extensive tiling of the derived 2x2 checkerboard.
*   **Rule C (train_2):** This rule was significantly incorrect. The use of `create_border_tile` and the assumed 2x2 meta-tiling based on Q3 corners did not match the output. The actual transformation involves replacing zeros in the pattern quadrant (Q4) with corresponding values from the fill quadrant (Q3) to create a base 4x4 tile, and then tiling this base tile 4x4 times to produce the 16x16 output.
*   **Rule D (train_3):** The general idea of zero replacement and modification was correct, but the specific rows selected and the columns appended were inaccurate. The correct logic involves selecting rows `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` from the zero-replaced pattern quadrant and appending two columns of the *fill value*, not columns derived from the pattern quadrant.

## Strategy for Resolution

1.  **Refine Tiling Rules (B, C):** Adjust the tiling factors based on the observed input/output dimension ratios. Implement the correct base tile creation for Rule C by element-wise combination of pattern and fill quadrants before tiling.
2.  **Correct Modification Rule (D):** Implement the revised row selection indices (`[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`) and append columns consisting solely of the `fill_value`.
3.  **Verify Quadrant Roles:** Double-check the pattern/fill quadrant assignment logic, although the current heuristic (complexity, Q4 default) seems consistent across examples.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the corrected transformation logic for each rule.

*Note: For train_2, the `fill_value` logic needs refinement. It uses multiple values from Q3 (1 and 5), not just a single dominant one.*

relationships:
  - The output_grid is derived primarily from Q3 and Q4 of the input_grid.
  - The complexity of Q3 and Q4 determines their roles as pattern_quadrant and fill_quadrant.
  - Zeros in the pattern_quadrant are often replaced or combined using values from the fill_quadrant or the single fill_value.
  - Output dimensions depend on the specific rule: copying, tiling (with specific factors), row/column selection/modification.
```

## Natural Language Program

1.  Divide the `input_grid` into four equal quadrants: top-left (Q1), top-right (Q2), bottom-left (Q3), and bottom-right (Q4).
2.  Analyze the complexity (number of unique non-zero values) of Q3 and Q4. Designate the quadrant with higher complexity as `pattern_quadrant`. If complexities are equal, designate Q4 as `pattern_quadrant`. Designate the other quadrant as `fill_quadrant`.
3.  Determine the `fill_value` by finding the most frequent non-zero value in `fill_quadrant`. If `fill_quadrant` contains only zeros, `fill_value` is 0.
4.  Apply a specific transformation rule based on the characteristics of `pattern_quadrant` and `fill_quadrant`:

    *   **Rule A (Direct Copy - train_4):** If `fill_value` is 0 and `pattern_quadrant` is Q3, the `output_grid` is identical to `pattern_quadrant`.
    *   **Rule B (Value Combination Tiling - train_1):** If `pattern_quadrant` is Q4 containing values {5, 6} (often with 0s) and `fill_quadrant` is Q3 containing value {1} (often with 0s), create a 2x2 `base_tile` `[[6, 5], [5, 6]]`. Tile this `base_tile` to create an `output_grid` that is 4 times the dimensions of the `pattern_quadrant` (e.g., if Q4 is 4x4, output is 16x16).
    *   **Rule C (Pattern Application Tiling - train_2):** If `pattern_quadrant` is Q4 containing value {4} (often with 0s, forming a pattern like a border) and `fill_quadrant` is Q3 containing values {1, 5} (often in uniform rows/blocks), create a `base_tile` the same size as `pattern_quadrant` by taking `pattern_quadrant` and replacing its 0s with the corresponding element from `fill_quadrant`. Tile this `base_tile` 4x4 times to create the `output_grid` (e.g., if `base_tile` is 4x4, output is 16x16).
    *   **Rule D (Zero Replacement and Modification - train_3):** If `pattern_quadrant` is Q4 containing values {6, 8} (often with 0s) and `fill_quadrant` is Q3 containing value {1}, create a temporary grid `P_mod` by replacing the 0s in `pattern_quadrant` with the `fill_value` (1). Select rows `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` from `P_mod`. Form the `output_grid` by taking these selected rows and appending two new columns filled entirely with the `fill_value` (1) to the right.
    *   **Rule E (Zero Replacement and Row Selection - train_5):** If `pattern_quadrant` is Q4 containing value {1} (often with 0s) and `fill_quadrant` is Q3 containing value {6}, create a temporary grid by replacing the 0s in `pattern_quadrant` with the `fill_value` (6). The `output_grid` consists of the first 3 rows of this temporary grid.

5.  Return the generated `output_grid`.
