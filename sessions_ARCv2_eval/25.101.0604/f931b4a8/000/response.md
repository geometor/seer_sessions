## Perception of Elements

The task involves transforming an input grid of numbers into an output grid. The input grids are typically square (e.g., 8x8, 16x16) and often appear divisible into four equal quadrants. The transformation seems to primarily depend on the content and structure of the bottom-left (Q3) and bottom-right (Q4) quadrants of the input grid.

Key observations:
1.  **Quadrant Importance:** The transformation logic heavily relies on analyzing the patterns and values within Q3 and Q4. The top half of the input often contains uniform blocks that seem less critical or ignored in some examples.
2.  **Pattern vs. Fill:** One of the bottom quadrants (Q3 or Q4) typically contains a more prominent or complex pattern (e.g., checkerboard, border, multiple distinct numbers), acting as the primary "pattern source". The other quadrant often provides a simpler pattern or a uniform background color, acting as the "fill source". The quadrant with higher complexity (more distinct non-zero values, structural features) is usually the pattern source.
3.  **Value Extraction:** The non-zero numbers present in both the pattern and fill quadrants are used in constructing the output. Zeros in the pattern quadrant are often replaced by the non-zero value(s) from the fill quadrant.
4.  **Output Construction:** The way the extracted values and patterns are used to build the output varies significantly:
    *   Direct copy of a quadrant (train_4).
    *   Tiling with a derived pattern (train_1, train_2).
    *   Interleaving rows/elements (train_5).
    *   Replacing zeros and then modifying the grid structure (e.g., insertions) (train_3).
5.  **Output Size:** The dimensions of the output grid are not fixed relative to the input but depend on the specific transformation rule triggered by the input patterns.

relationships:
  - The output_grid is derived from Q3 and Q4 of the input_grid.
  - The complexity of Q3 and Q4 determines which serves as the pattern_quadrant and fill_quadrant.
  - Zeros in the pattern_quadrant are often replaced or filled using the fill_value.
  - The specific structure of both pattern_quadrant and fill_quadrant dictates the final transformation rule (e.g., tiling, copying, interleaving, inserting).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Divide the `input_grid` into four equal quadrants: top-left (Q1), top-right (Q2), bottom-left (Q3), and bottom-right (Q4).
2.  Analyze the complexity (number of distinct non-zero values, presence of structural patterns like checkerboards, borders) of Q3 and Q4. Designate the more complex quadrant as `pattern_quadrant` and the other as `fill_quadrant`.
3.  Extract the set of unique non-zero numbers and the structural pattern description from `pattern_quadrant`. Note if zeros are present.
4.  Determine the primary non-zero value(s) from `fill_quadrant`. If `fill_quadrant` contains only zeros, the `fill_value` is 0. Otherwise, it's typically the most frequent or sole non-zero value.
5.  Apply a specific transformation rule based on the characteristics of `pattern_quadrant` and `fill_quadrant`:
    *   **Rule A (Direct Copy):** If `fill_value` is 0, the `output_grid` is identical to `pattern_quadrant`.
    *   **Rule B (Value Combination Tiling):** If `pattern_quadrant` has a simple structure (e.g., checkerboard like N1, 0) and `fill_quadrant` is uniform (N2), create a new pattern combining N1 and N2 (e.g., `[[N1, N2], [N2, N1]]`) and tile the `output_grid` with it. Determine output dimensions based on input quadrant size and tiling factor.
    *   **Rule C (Pattern Application):** If `pattern_quadrant` has a structure (e.g., border N1, 0) and `fill_quadrant` provides multiple values (N2, N3), construct `output_grid` by tiling blocks where the structure from `pattern_quadrant` (e.g., border N1) is combined with values from `fill_quadrant` (e.g., inner N2, N3) according to a derived tiling logic. Determine output dimensions based on input quadrant size and tiling factor.
    *   **Rule D (Zero Replacement and Modification):** If `pattern_quadrant` is complex (multiple non-zeros N1, N2, and 0s) and `fill_quadrant` is uniform (N3), create a base grid by replacing 0s in `pattern_quadrant` with N3. The `output_grid` is formed by modifying this base grid (e.g., inserting rows/columns of N3). Determine output dimensions based on modification rule.
    *   **Rule E (Interleaving):** If structures in `pattern_quadrant` and `fill_quadrant` suggest interleaving (e.g., uniform rows N1 in one, rows of N2/0 in the other), construct the `output_grid` by taking specific rows/elements from each, guided by the structure of `fill_quadrant`. Determine output dimensions based on interleaving logic.
6.  Return the generated `output_grid`.
