  - description: Input Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - characteristic: contains a single dominant background number and multiple foreground numbers
  - description: Background Number
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - characteristic: most frequent number in the grid
      - role: ignored during extraction
  - description: Foreground Numbers
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - characteristic: any number not equal to the background number
      - role: numbers to be extracted, counted, and ordered
  - description: Output Structure
    properties:
      - type: List of lists (or equivalent column vector representation)
      - dimensions: N x 1, where N is the total count of all foreground numbers
      - content: repetitions of foreground numbers based on their counts
      - order: determined by the first appearance of each unique foreground number during grid traversal (top-to-bottom, left-to-right)

    action: Extraction, Counting, Ordering, and Formatting
    steps:
      - Identify the background number (most frequent).
      - Scan the grid (row-by-row, left-to-right) to find unique foreground numbers and record their order of first appearance.
      - Count the total occurrences of each unique foreground number.
      - Construct the output list by sequentially adding each unique foreground number (in order of first appearance) repeated by its total count.
      - Format the final output as a column structure (e.g., a list of single-element lists), where each foreground number instance occupies one row.
