            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nThe task involves processing a 2D grid of numbers. The grid contains a predominant \"background\" number and several clusters or occurrences of other \"foreground\" numbers. The goal is to extract these foreground numbers and represent their frequency in the output. The output is a 1D list where each foreground number from the input grid is repeated a number of times equal to its count in the input grid. The order of numbers in the output list corresponds to the order in which the distinct foreground numbers are first encountered when scanning the input grid row by row, then column by column.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_elements:\n  - description: Input Grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array of integers\n      - contains_background: True\n      - contains_foreground_objects: True\n  - description: Background Number\n    properties:\n      - type: integer\n      - characteristic: most frequent number in the grid\n      - role: distinguishes foreground objects\n  - description: Foreground Objects\n    properties:\n      - type: integer\n      - characteristic: any number not equal to the background number\n      - count: number of occurrences in the grid is significant\n  - description: Output List\n    properties:\n      - type: 1D list of integers\n      - content: repetitions of foreground numbers based on their counts\n      - order: based on the first appearance of each unique foreground number during grid traversal (top-to-bottom, left-to-right)\n\nrelationships:\n  - description: Input Grid to Output List\n    action: Extraction and Counting\n    steps:\n      - Identify the background number.\n      - Identify all unique foreground numbers.\n      - Determine the order of first appearance for each unique foreground number.\n      - Count the total occurrences of each unique foreground number.\n      - Construct the output list by appending each unique foreground number (in order of first appearance) repeated by its count.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Determine the background number, which is the most frequently occurring number in the input grid.\n2.  Initialize an empty list called `output_list`.\n3.  Initialize an empty list called `first_seen_order` to store the unique foreground numbers in the order they are first encountered.\n4.  Initialize an empty dictionary called `foreground_counts` to store the counts of each foreground number.\n5.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid, row by row from top to bottom, and within each row, column by column from left to right.\n6.  For each cell value:\n    a.  Check if the cell value is different from the background number.\n    b.  If it is different (it's a foreground number):\n        i.  Increment the count for this number in the `foreground_counts` dictionary (initialize the count to 1 if it's the first time seeing this number).\n        ii. Check if this number is already present in the `first_seen_order` list.\n        iii. If it is not present, add it to the `first_seen_order` list.\n7.  Iterate through the numbers in the `first_seen_order` list (maintaining the order).\n8.  For each number in `first_seen_order`:\n    a.  Retrieve its count from the `foreground_counts` dictionary.\n    b.  Append the number to the `output_list` exactly that many times (equal to its count).\n9.  Return the `output_list`."
