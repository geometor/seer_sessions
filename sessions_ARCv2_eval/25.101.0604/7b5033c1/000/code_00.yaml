  - description: Input Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - contains_background: True
      - contains_foreground_objects: True
  - description: Background Number
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - characteristic: most frequent number in the grid
      - role: distinguishes foreground objects
  - description: Foreground Objects
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - characteristic: any number not equal to the background number
      - count: number of occurrences in the grid is significant
  - description: Output List
    properties:
      - type: 1D list of integers
      - content: repetitions of foreground numbers based on their counts
      - order: based on the first appearance of each unique foreground number during grid traversal (top-to-bottom, left-to-right)

    action: Extraction and Counting
    steps:
      - Identify the background number.
      - Identify all unique foreground numbers.
      - Determine the order of first appearance for each unique foreground number.
      - Count the total occurrences of each unique foreground number.
      - Construct the output list by appending each unique foreground number (in order of first appearance) repeated by its count.
