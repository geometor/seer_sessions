```python
"""
Transforms a 2D input grid of integers into a 1D column (represented as a list of lists) 
containing all non-background integers from the input. 

The transformation follows these steps:
1. Identify the background number, which is the most frequent number in the input grid.
2. Scan the grid row by row, then column by column (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
3. Keep track of the unique non-background (foreground) numbers encountered and the order in which they first appear.
4. Count the total occurrences of each unique foreground number in the grid.
5. Construct the output column by sequentially adding each unique foreground number (in the order of their first appearance). Each number should be added as many times as its total count in the input grid.
6. Each number in the output column is represented as a single-element list (e.g., [[1], [1], [1], [3], [3], ...]).
