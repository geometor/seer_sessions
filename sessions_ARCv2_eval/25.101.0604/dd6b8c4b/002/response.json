            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation involving the `[[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]` pattern located at rows 4-6, columns 4-6. The transformation's dependency on the 12 border neighbors was also correctly identified.\n\nHowever, the execution results reveal errors:\n1.  **Incorrect Conditional Logic (Example 2):** The transformation applied when the count of neighboring '6's (`count6`) was 10 (which falls under the `> 8` condition in the code) was incorrect. The expected output required a different transformation (`[[9,9,9],[9,9,9],[9,9,9]]`) than the one implemented (`[[9,9,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`). This indicates the thresholds or specific conditions based on `count6` need refinement.\n2.  **Unaccounted Transformations (Example 1 & 3):** In examples 1 and 3, the code correctly transforms the central pattern according to the *expected* output (after correcting the logic based on Ex 2), but there are additional changes (`9` changing to `7`) in the expected output that the code does not perform. This suggests a secondary transformation rule exists that was either missed or incorrectly hypothesized initially (the \"all 7 neighbors\" rule proposed earlier seems insufficient based on the test results).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Primary Transformation:** Analyze the `count6` values and corresponding expected output patterns across all three examples to establish the correct conditional logic for transforming the central `3x3` pattern.\n    *   Ex 1: `count6 = 12`. Expected Output Pattern: `[[9,9,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.\n    *   Ex 2: `count6 = 10`. Expected Output Pattern: `[[9,9,9],[9,9,9],[9,9,9]]`.\n    *   Ex 3: `count6 = 0`. Expected Output Pattern: `[[9,9,9],[9,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.\n    This leads to revised conditions: `count6 == 0`, `count6 == 12`, and `0 < count6 < 12`.\n2.  **Address Secondary Transformation:** Isolate the `9 -> 7` changes. Since the provided code *only* implements the central pattern change, the mismatches in Ex 1 and Ex 3 are due to this missing secondary rule. Acknowledge this rule exists but focus the current refinement on perfecting the primary transformation, as implemented in the provided code. The secondary rule might involve different neighbor conditions or relate to other grid properties. For now, the natural language program will only describe the refined primary transformation.\n3.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the facts (YAML) and natural language program to reflect the corrected conditional logic for the primary transformation.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example   | Input Pattern `[4:7, 4:7]` | Border Neighbors `count6` | Expected Output Pattern `[4:7, 4:7]` | Code Output Pattern `[4:7, 4:7]` | Pattern Match? | Other Mismatches (Code vs Expected) | Mismatch Locations (Code vs Expected) |\n| :-------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------ | :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :------------- | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |\n| train_1 | `[[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`  | 12                        | `[[9,9,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`          | `[[9,9,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`      | Yes            | 2                                   | `(8,7)`, `(8,8)` (Input 9 -> Expected 7) |\n| train_2 | `[[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`  | 10                        | `[[9,9,9],[9,9,9],[9,9,9]]`          | `[[9,9,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`      | No             | 6                                   | `(4,4)-(4,6)`, `(5,4)-(5,6)`          |\n| train_3 | `[[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`  | 0                         | `[[9,9,9],[9,2,3],[3,3,3]]`          | `[[9,9,9],[9,2,3],[3,3,3]]`      | Yes            | 4                                   | `(1,9)`, `(2,10)`, `(8,8)`, `(9,8)` (Input 9 -> Expected 7) |\n\n*Note: The \"Mismatch Locations\" column for Ex 2 shows the 6 cells within the central pattern where the code's output differed from the expected output due to the incorrect conditional logic. The \"Other Mismatches\" for Ex 1 and Ex 3 reflect pixels outside the central pattern that changed from 9 to 7 in the expected output but were left unchanged by the code.*\n\n## Facts\n\n```yaml\nelements:\n  - object: grid\n    description: An 11x11 grid of single digits.\n  - object: pattern_region\n    description: A specific 3x3 subgrid pattern [[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]] located at input grid indices [4:7, 4:7].\n    properties:\n      - center_value: 2\n      - surrounding_value: 3\n      - location: Fixed at rows 4-6, columns 4-6.\n  - object: border_neighbors\n    description: The 12 cells immediately adjacent (N, S, E, W) to the boundary of the pattern_region.

Initialize the `output_grid` as a deep copy of the `input_grid`.\n2.  Define the target `pattern_region` as `[[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]` and its location as rows 4-6, columns 4-6 (0-indexed, slice `[4:7, 4:7]`).\n3.  Extract the actual 3x3 subgrid from the `input_grid` at the target location.\n4.  Check if the extracted subgrid matches the `pattern_region`.\n5.  If the pattern matches:\n    a.  Identify the 12 `border_neighbor` cells surrounding the `pattern_region`.\n    b.  Count the number of cells with value `6` among these 12 `border_neighbor` cells (`count6`).\n    c.  Determine the `transformed_pattern` based on `count6`:\n        i.  If `count6` is 0, set `transformed_pattern` to `[[9,9,9],[9,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.\n        ii. Else if `count6` is 12, set `transformed_pattern` to `[[9,9,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.\n        iii. Else (if `0 < count6 < 12`), set `transformed_pattern` to `[[9,9,9],[9,9,9],[9,9,9]]`.\n    d.  Update the corresponding 3x3 region in the `output_grid` with the `transformed_pattern`.\n6.  Return the `output_grid`. (Note: This program only describes the transformation of the central pattern based on its neighbors, as implemented in the evaluated code. It does not account for the secondary `9` to `7` changes observed in the expected outputs of Examples 1 and 3)."
