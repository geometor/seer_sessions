            "text": "*   **perception**: The input and output are 11x11 grids of digits. The core transformation appears centered around a specific 3x3 pattern `[[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]` which is consistently located at rows 4-6 and columns 4-6 (0-indexed) in the input grids. The transformation applied to this pattern depends on the values of the cells immediately surrounding this 3x3 block. A secondary transformation involving changing some `9`s to `7`s also occurs in some examples, but its rule is less clear and consistent across examples compared to the central pattern transformation. The digits likely represent different states or colors, with `7` often acting as a background or boundary color, `6` as another boundary/region color, and `2`/`3` forming the core pattern that gets transformed into `9`s under specific contextual conditions.\n\n*   **facts**:\n    ```yaml\n    elements:\n      - object: grid\n        description: An 11x11 grid of single digits.\n      - object: pattern_region\n        description: A specific 3x3 subgrid pattern [[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]] located at input grid indices [4:7, 4:7].\n        properties:\n          - center_value: 2\n          - surrounding_value: 3\n          - location: Fixed at rows 4-6, columns 4-6.\n      - object: border_neighbors\n        description: The 12 cells immediately adjacent (N, S, E, W) to the boundary of the pattern_region.\n        properties:\n          - values: Vary across examples, primarily containing 6s and 7s.\n      - object: digit_9\n        description: Represents a state/color '9'.\n      - object: digit_7\n        description: Represents a state/color '7', often acting as a background or boundary.\n      - object: digit_6\n        description: Represents a state/color '6', often acting as a boundary near the pattern_region.\n\n    actions:\n      - action: locate_pattern\n        description: Identify the 3x3 pattern_region in the input grid.\n      - action: analyze_neighbors\n        description: Examine the values of the border_neighbors surrounding the pattern_region.\n      - action: count_border_values\n        description: Count the occurrences of specific digits (e.g., '6', '7') within the border_neighbors.\n      - action: transform_pattern\n        description: Modify the values within the pattern_region based on the analysis of its border_neighbors.

Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    2.  Identify the 3x3 subgrid region corresponding to input grid indices rows 4-6 and columns 4-6. Check if this region matches the pattern `P = [[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.\n    3.  If the pattern `P` is found at the specified location:\n        a.  Examine the 12 'border neighbor' cells surrounding this 3x3 region (cells at (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7)).\n        b.  Count the number of cells with value `6` (`count6`) among these 12 border neighbors.\n        c.  Count the number of cells with value `7` (`count7`) among these 12 border neighbors.\n        d.  Apply a transformation to the 3x3 region in the output grid based on the counts:\n            i.  If `count6` is 0 (and `count7` is 12): Update the 3x3 region in the output grid to `[[9,9,9],[9,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.\n            ii. Else if `count6` is greater than 8: Update the 3x3 region in the output grid to `[[9,9,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.\n            iii. Else if `count6` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 8: Update the 3x3 region in the output grid to `[[9,9,9],[9,9,9],[9,9,9]]`.\n    4.  (Optional/Secondary) Iterate through the input grid. If a cell contains `9` and all of its 8 neighbors contain `7`, change the corresponding cell in the output grid to `7`. *[Note: This secondary rule only partially explains the 9->7 changes observed and might not be complete or correct.]*\n    5.  Return the final output grid."
