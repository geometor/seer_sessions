            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe refined code correctly implements the transformation logic for the central 3x3 pattern `[[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]` based on the count of neighboring `6`s (`count6`). The conditions (`count6 == 0`, `count6 == 11`, `else`) accurately predict the changes within this specific 3x3 region across all three training examples.\n\nHowever, the execution results show that this primary transformation is insufficient to fully replicate the expected outputs. In all three examples, there are remaining discrepancies where cells with the value `9` in the input grid (or the intermediate grid after the primary transformation) are expected to be `7` in the final output grid. These `9 -> 7` changes occur *outside* the central 3x3 region in Examples 1 and 3, and at various locations in Example 2.\n\nThe rule governing this secondary `9 -> 7` transformation is not immediately obvious from the neighbor analysis conducted so far. It might depend on more complex neighborhood configurations, global grid properties, or distance from specific features.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Confirm Primary Logic:** The logic for the central 3x3 pattern transformation based on `count6` is validated by the latest execution results matching the expected *central pattern* outputs.\n2.  **Document Primary Logic:** Update the facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the confirmed primary transformation rules (`count6=0`, `count6=11`, `else`).\n3.  **Acknowledge Secondary Logic Gap:** Explicitly state that a secondary `9 -> 7` transformation occurs, but the precise conditions triggering it could not be determined from the provided examples. Document the observed locations of these changes for future analysis.\n4.  **Refine Documentation:** Focus the YAML and Natural Language Program on the well-understood primary transformation, clearly noting the limitation regarding the secondary changes.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example   | Input Pattern `[4:7, 4:7]` | Border Neighbors `count6` | Expected Output Pattern `[4:7, 4:7]` | Code Output Pattern `[4:7, 4:7]` | Pattern Match? | Pixels Off (Code vs Expected) | Score (Reported) | Locations of Mismatched Pixels (Input 9 -> Expected 7) |\n| :-------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------ | :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :------------- | :---------------------------- | :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |\n| train_1 | `[[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`  | 11                        | `[[9,9,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`          | `[[9,9,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`      | Yes            | 2                             | 3.3              | `(8,7)`, `(8,8)`                                       |\n| train_2 | `[[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`  | 10                        | `[[9,9,9],[9,9,9],[9,9,9]]`          | `[[9,9,9],[9,9,9],[9,9,9]]`      | Yes            | 9 (*)                         | 14.9             | `(4,8)`, `(6,8)`, `(8,1)`, `(8,5)`, `(9,2)`, `(9,5)` (*) |\n| train_3 | `[[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`  | 0                         | `[[9,9,9],[9,2,3],[3,3,3]]`          | `[[9,9,9],[9,2,3],[3,3,3]]`      | Yes            | 4                             | 6.6              | `(1,9)`, `(2,10)`, `(8,8)`, `(9,8)`                     |\n\n(*) Note: Manual analysis of Example 2 suggests 6 pixels should be different due to the `9->7` rule. The execution report indicates 9 pixels off. The listed locations cover the 6 identified `9->7` changes based on comparison of input and expected output. The discrepancy in count might stem from the specific comparison method or an error in the report/analysis. The strategy focuses on the identified pattern of missed `9->7` changes.\n\n## Facts\n\n```yaml\nelements:\n  - object: grid\n    description: An 11x11 grid of single digits (integers 0-9).\n  - object: pattern_region\n    description: A specific 3x3 subgrid pattern [[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]] located at input grid indices [4:7, 4:7].\n    properties:\n      - pattern_values: [[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]\n      - location: Fixed at rows 4-6, columns 4-6 (slice [4:7, 4:7]).\n  - object: border_neighbors\n    description: The 12 cells immediately adjacent (N, S, E, W) to the boundary of the pattern_region.\n    properties:\n      - coordinates: [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7)]\n      - values: Vary across examples, primarily containing 6s and 7s in the input.\n  - object: digit_6_count\n    description: The count of cells with value 6 among the 12 border_neighbors.

Initialize an `output_grid` as a deep copy of the `input_grid`.\n2.  **Primary Transformation (Central Pattern):**\n    a.  Define the target `pattern_region` as the 3x3 subgrid `[[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]` located at rows 4-6, columns 4-6 (slice `[4:7, 4:7]`) in the `input_grid`.\n    b.  Check if the subgrid at the target location in the `input_grid` exactly matches the `pattern_region`.\n    c.  If the pattern matches:\n        i.  Identify the 12 `border_neighbor` cells surrounding the `pattern_region` using their fixed coordinates.\n        ii. Count how many of these 12 `border_neighbor` cells contain the value `6` in the `input_grid`. Store this count as `count6`.\n        iii. Determine the appropriate `transformed_pattern` based on `count6`:\n            *   If `count6` is exactly 0, the `transformed_pattern` is `[[9,9,9],[9,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.\n            *   Else if `count6` is exactly 11, the `transformed_pattern` is `[[9,9,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.\n            *   Else (if `count6` is any value from 1 to 10, or 12), the `transformed_pattern` is `[[9,9,9],[9,9,9],[9,9,9]]`.\n        iv. Replace the 3x3 subgrid at rows 4-6, columns 4-6 in the `output_grid` with the determined `transformed_pattern`.\n3.  **Secondary Transformation (Unresolved Rule):**\n    a.  Identify all cells in the `input_grid` that contain the value `9`.\n    b.  Apply an **unknown rule** to determine which of these `9`s should be changed to `7`. *(Observations: This change occurred at coordinates (8,7),(8,8) in Ex1; (4,8),(6,8),(8,1),(8,5),(9,2),(9,5) in Ex2; and (1,9),(2,10),(8,8),(9,8) in Ex3. The rule is not simply based on neighbor counts of 6s or 9s tested so far.)*\n    c.  For each input cell `(r, c)` identified in step 3b where the unknown rule applies, set `output_grid[r][c]` to `7`. *(Note: This step overrides any value potentially set by the primary transformation if the cell is within the central 3x3 region, although none of the observed 9->7 changes occurred within that region)*.\n4.  Return the `output_grid`.\n\n*(Disclaimer: Step 3 describes an observed phenomenon whose governing rule is not yet defined. The implemented code only performs Step 1 and Step 2.)*"
