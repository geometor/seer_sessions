            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous execution attempt successfully identified the core transformation mechanism involving the central 3x3 pattern `[[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]` and its dependence on the 12 border neighbors. However, the analysis of the execution results reveals two key issues:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Conditional Logic:** The specific conditions based on the count of neighboring '6's (`count6`) used to determine *which* transformation to apply to the central pattern were inaccurate. The results show that different `count6` values trigger different output patterns than initially assumed and implemented. Re-evaluating the `count6` for each example against its *expected* output pattern is necessary.\n    *   Example 1 Input: `count6 = 11`. Expected Output Pattern: `[[9,9,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.\n    *   Example 2 Input: `count6 = 10`. Expected Output Pattern: `[[9,9,9],[9,9,9],[9,9,9]]`.\n    *   Example 3 Input: `count6 = 0`. Expected Output Pattern: `[[9,9,9],[9,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.\n    This leads to a revised hypothesis for the central pattern transformation rules.\n2.  **Unaccounted Secondary Transformation:** All three examples show discrepancies between the code's output (which only transforms the central pattern) and the expected output. These discrepancies involve cells with value `9` in the input (or intermediate state after central transformation) changing to `7` in the final expected output. These changes occur *outside* the central 3x3 pattern in Ex1 and Ex3, and also potentially affect the overall pixel count differences noted in the execution report for Ex2 (although the central pattern transformation for Ex2 appeared correct based on the revised logic). The rule governing this `9 -> 7` change is not yet clear from the examples and was not implemented in the previous code.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Central Pattern Transformation Logic:** Update the transformation rules for the `pattern_region` based on the corrected `count6` values derived from analyzing the input examples and their *expected* outputs. The new rules appear to be specific to `count6 = 0`, `count6 = 11`, and all other values (`0 < count6 < 11` or `count6 = 12`).\n2.  **Isolate and Analyze Secondary Transformation:** Acknowledge the `9 -> 7` transformation as a separate step or rule. Note the locations where it occurs across the examples. Since the rule is not obvious, explicitly state that the refined natural language program and YAML will focus only on the primary central pattern transformation, and the `9 -> 7` change remains an unresolved aspect for future investigation.\n3.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and the natural language program to accurately reflect the refined understanding of the central pattern transformation, including the specific `count6` conditions and resulting output patterns. Clearly state the limitation regarding the secondary `9 -> 7` changes.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics based on the *expected* outcomes if the **revised** central pattern logic were implemented (Note: Mismatches due to the secondary `9->7` rule are listed separately).\n\n| Example   | Input Pattern `[4:7, 4:7]` | Border Neighbors `count6` | Expected Output Pattern `[4:7, 4:7]` | Revised Code Output Pattern `[4:7, 4:7]` (Hypothetical) | Pattern Match?

The remaining discrepancies are solely due to the unresolved `9 -> 7` secondary transformation.\n\n## Facts\n\n```yaml\nelements:\n  - object: grid\n    description: An 11x11 grid of single digits (integers 0-9).\n  - object: pattern_region\n    description: A specific 3x3 subgrid pattern [[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]] located at input grid indices [4:7, 4:7].\n    properties:\n      - pattern_values: [[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]\n      - location: Fixed at rows 4-6, columns 4-6 (slice [4:7, 4:7]).\n  - object: border_neighbors\n    description: The 12 cells immediately adjacent (N, S, E, W) to the boundary of the pattern_region.\n    properties:\n      - coordinates: [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7)]\n      - values: Vary across examples, primarily containing 6s and 7s in the input.\n  - object: digit_6_count\n    description: The count of cells with value 6 among the 12 border_neighbors.

Initialize an `output_grid` as a deep copy of the `input_grid`.\n2.  Define the target `pattern_region` as the 3x3 subgrid `[[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]` located at rows 4-6, columns 4-6 (slice `[4:7, 4:7]`) in the `input_grid`.\n3.  Check if the subgrid at the target location in the `input_grid` exactly matches the `pattern_region`.\n4.  If the pattern matches:\n    a.  Identify the 12 `border_neighbor` cells surrounding the `pattern_region` using their fixed coordinates: `[(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7)]`.\n    b.  Count how many of these 12 `border_neighbor` cells contain the value `6` in the `input_grid`. Store this count as `count6`.\n    c.  Determine the appropriate `transformed_pattern` to apply to the `output_grid` based on `count6`:\n        i.  If `count6` is exactly 0, the `transformed_pattern` is `[[9,9,9],[9,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.\n        ii. Else if `count6` is exactly 11, the `transformed_pattern` is `[[9,9,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.\n        iii. Else (if `count6` is any value from 1 to 10, or 12), the `transformed_pattern` is `[[9,9,9],[9,9,9],[9,9,9]]`.\n    d.  Replace the 3x3 subgrid at rows 4-6, columns 4-6 in the `output_grid` with the determined `transformed_pattern`.\n5.  Return the `output_grid`.\n    *(Note: This program accurately describes the transformation observed within the central 3x3 pattern based on its neighbors. It does **not** account for the secondary rule observed in the examples where some cells with value `9` change to `7` outside of this specific pattern manipulation. The logic for the `9 -> 7` change is currently unknown.)*"
