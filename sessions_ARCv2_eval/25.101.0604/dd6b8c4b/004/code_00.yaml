elements:
  - object: grid
    description: An 11x11 grid of single digits (integers 0-9).
  - object: pattern_region
    description: A specific 3x3 subgrid pattern [[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]] located at input grid indices [4:7, 4:7].
    properties:
      - pattern_values: [[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]
      - location: Fixed at rows 4-6, columns 4-6 (slice [4:7, 4:7]).
  - object: border_neighbors
    description: The 12 cells immediately adjacent (N, S, E, W) to the boundary of the pattern_region.
    properties:
      - coordinates: [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7)]
      - values: Vary across examples, primarily containing 6s and 7s in the input.
  - object: digit_6_count
    description: The count of cells with value 6 among the 12 border_neighbors. Alias `count6`.
  - object: transformed_pattern_type_1
    description: The output pattern [[9,9,9],[9,2,3],[3,3,3]] for the pattern_region.
  - object: transformed_pattern_type_2
    description: The output pattern [[9,9,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]] for the pattern_region.
  - object: transformed_pattern_type_3
    description: The output pattern [[9,9,9],[9,9,9],[9,9,9]] for the pattern_region.
  - object: digit_9
    description: Represents state/color '9'. Appears in outputs and as input. Some input '9's change to '7'.
  - object: digit_7
    description: Represents state/color '7'. Acts as background/boundary. Some input '9's change to '7'.

actions:
  - action: copy_grid
    description: Initialize the output grid as a deep copy of the input grid.
  - action: locate_pattern
    description: Identify if the 3x3 subgrid at input indices [4:7, 4:7] matches the pattern_region definition.
  - action: analyze_neighbors
    description: Examine the values of the 12 border_neighbors in the input grid.
  - action: count_border_sixes
    description: Count the occurrences of digit '6' within the 12 border_neighbors (`count6`).
  - action: select_transformation
    description: Choose the correct transformed pattern (type 1, 2, or 3) based on the value of `count6`.
  - action: apply_central_transformation
    description: Update the 3x3 region at [4:7, 4:7] in the output grid with the selected transformed pattern.
  # - action: apply_secondary_transformation (Rule Undefined)
  #   description: Change specific '9' values to '7' in the output grid. The conditions for this change are currently unknown and not implemented by the core logic described.

relationships:
  - relationship: pattern_transformation_dependency
    description: The transformation applied to the pattern_region is strictly dependent on the `count6` of its border_neighbors.
    properties:
      - condition_1: If `count6` is 0, apply `transformed_pattern_type_1`.
      - condition_2: If `count6` is 11, apply `transformed_pattern_type_2`.
      - condition_3: If `count6` is any other value (1-10 or 12), apply `transformed_pattern_type_3`.
  - relationship: unresolved_9_to_7_change
    description: Some cells with value '9' in the input grid are changed to '7' in the output grid. This transformation occurs outside the primary pattern_region transformation logic and its rules are currently undetermined.
