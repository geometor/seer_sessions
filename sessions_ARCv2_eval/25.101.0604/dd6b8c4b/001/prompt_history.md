*   **perception**: The input and output are 11x11 grids of digits. The core transformation appears centered around a specific 3x3 pattern `[[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]` which is consistently located at rows 4-6 and columns 4-6 (0-indexed) in the input grids. The transformation applied to this pattern depends on the values of the cells immediately surrounding this 3x3 block. A secondary transformation involving changing some `9`s to `7`s also occurs in some examples, but its rule is less clear and consistent across examples compared to the central pattern transformation. The digits likely represent different states or colors, with `7` often acting as a background or boundary color, `6` as another boundary/region color, and `2`/`3` forming the core pattern that gets transformed into `9`s under specific contextual conditions.

    ```yaml
    elements:
      - object: grid
        description: An 11x11 grid of single digits.
      - object: pattern_region
        description: A specific 3x3 subgrid pattern [[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]] located at input grid indices [4:7, 4:7].
        properties:
          - center_value: 2
          - surrounding_value: 3
          - location: Fixed at rows 4-6, columns 4-6.
      - object: border_neighbors
        description: The 12 cells immediately adjacent (N, S, E, W) to the boundary of the pattern_region.
        properties:
          - values: Vary across examples, primarily containing 6s and 7s.
      - object: digit_9
        description: Represents a state/color '9'.
      - object: digit_7
        description: Represents a state/color '7', often acting as a background or boundary.
      - object: digit_6
        description: Represents a state/color '6', often acting as a boundary near the pattern_region.

        description: Count the occurrences of specific digits (e.g., '6', '7') within the border_neighbors.
      - action: transform_pattern
        description: Modify the values within the pattern_region based on the analysis of its border_neighbors. Three distinct transformation outcomes for the pattern_region are observed depending on the neighbor counts.

        description: Apply the transformed pattern_region values to the corresponding location in the output grid.
      - action: modify_digit_9 # Secondary, less clear action
        description: In some cases, change cells with value 9 to 7 based on neighborhood conditions (rule unclear/inconsistent).

    relationships:
      - relationship: pattern_dependency
        description: The transformation applied to the pattern_region is dependent on the composition of its border_neighbors.
        properties:
          - condition_1: If all border_neighbors are 7, apply transformation type 1.
          - condition_2: If the count of 6s in border_neighbors is > 8, apply transformation type 2.
          - condition_3: If the count of 6s in border_neighbors is > 0 and <= 8, apply transformation type 3.
    ```

*   **natural language program**:
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify the 3x3 subgrid region corresponding to input grid indices rows 4-6 and columns 4-6. Check if this region matches the pattern `P = [[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.
    3.  If the pattern `P` is found at the specified location:
        a.  Examine the 12 'border neighbor' cells surrounding this 3x3 region (cells at (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7)).
        b.  Count the number of cells with value `6` (`count6`) among these 12 border neighbors.
        c.  Count the number of cells with value `7` (`count7`) among these 12 border neighbors.
        d.  Apply a transformation to the 3x3 region in the output grid based on the counts:
            i.  If `count6` is 0 (and `count7` is 12): Update the 3x3 region in the output grid to `[[9,9,9],[9,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.
            ii. Else if `count6` is greater than 8: Update the 3x3 region in the output grid to `[[9,9,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.
            iii. Else if `count6` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 8: Update the 3x3 region in the output grid to `[[9,9,9],[9,9,9],[9,9,9]]`.
    4.  (Optional/Secondary) Iterate through the input grid. If a cell contains `9` and all of its 8 neighbors contain `7`, change the corresponding cell in the output grid to `7`. *[Note: This secondary rule only partially explains the 9->7 changes observed and might not be complete or correct.]*
    5.  Return the final output grid.
