*   **perception**: The input and output are 11x11 grids of digits. The core transformation appears centered around a specific 3x3 pattern `[[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]` which is consistently located at rows 4-6 and columns 4-6 (0-indexed) in the input grids. The transformation applied to this pattern depends on the values of the cells immediately surrounding this 3x3 block. A secondary transformation involving changing some `9`s to `7`s also occurs in some examples, but its rule is less clear and consistent across examples compared to the central pattern transformation. The digits likely represent different states or colors, with `7` often acting as a background or boundary color, `6` as another boundary/region color, and `2`/`3` forming the core pattern that gets transformed into `9`s under specific contextual conditions.

    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify the 3x3 subgrid region corresponding to input grid indices rows 4-6 and columns 4-6. Check if this region matches the pattern `P = [[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.
    3.  If the pattern `P` is found at the specified location:
        a.  Examine the 12 'border neighbor' cells surrounding this 3x3 region (cells at (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7)).
        b.  Count the number of cells with value `6` (`count6`) among these 12 border neighbors.
        c.  Count the number of cells with value `7` (`count7`) among these 12 border neighbors.
        d.  Apply a transformation to the 3x3 region in the output grid based on the counts:
            i.  If `count6` is 0 (and `count7` is 12): Update the 3x3 region in the output grid to `[[9,9,9],[9,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.
            ii. Else if `count6` is greater than 8: Update the 3x3 region in the output grid to `[[9,9,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.
            iii. Else if `count6` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 8: Update the 3x3 region in the output grid to `[[9,9,9],[9,9,9],[9,9,9]]`.
    4.  (Optional/Secondary) Iterate through the input grid. If a cell contains `9` and all of its 8 neighbors contain `7`, change the corresponding cell in the output grid to `7`. *[Note: This secondary rule only partially explains the 9->7 changes observed and might not be complete or correct.]*
    5.  Return the final output grid.

## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation involving the `[[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]` pattern located at rows 4-6, columns 4-6. The transformation's dependency on the 12 border neighbors was also correctly identified.

However, the execution results reveal errors:
1.  **Incorrect Conditional Logic (Example 2):** The transformation applied when the count of neighboring '6's (`count6`) was 10 (which falls under the `> 8` condition in the code) was incorrect. The expected output required a different transformation (`[[9,9,9],[9,9,9],[9,9,9]]`) than the one implemented (`[[9,9,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`). This indicates the thresholds or specific conditions based on `count6` need refinement.
2.  **Unaccounted Transformations (Example 1 & 3):** In examples 1 and 3, the code correctly transforms the central pattern according to the *expected* output (after correcting the logic based on Ex 2), but there are additional changes (`9` changing to `7`) in the expected output that the code does not perform. This suggests a secondary transformation rule exists that was either missed or incorrectly hypothesized initially (the "all 7 neighbors" rule proposed earlier seems insufficient based on the test results).

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Primary Transformation:** Analyze the `count6` values and corresponding expected output patterns across all three examples to establish the correct conditional logic for transforming the central `3x3` pattern.
    *   Ex 1: `count6 = 12`. Expected Output Pattern: `[[9,9,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.
    *   Ex 2: `count6 = 10`. Expected Output Pattern: `[[9,9,9],[9,9,9],[9,9,9]]`.
    *   Ex 3: `count6 = 0`. Expected Output Pattern: `[[9,9,9],[9,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.
    This leads to revised conditions: `count6 == 0`, `count6 == 12`, and `0 < count6 < 12`.
2.  **Address Secondary Transformation:** Isolate the `9 -> 7` changes. Since the provided code *only* implements the central pattern change, the mismatches in Ex 1 and Ex 3 are due to this missing secondary rule. Acknowledge this rule exists but focus the current refinement on perfecting the primary transformation, as implemented in the provided code. The secondary rule might involve different neighbor conditions or relate to other grid properties. For now, the natural language program will only describe the refined primary transformation.
3.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the facts (YAML) and natural language program to reflect the corrected conditional logic for the primary transformation.

*Note: The "Mismatch Locations" column for Ex 2 shows the 6 cells within the central pattern where the code's output differed from the expected output due to the incorrect conditional logic. The "Other Mismatches" for Ex 1 and Ex 3 reflect pixels outside the central pattern that changed from 9 to 7 in the expected output but were left unchanged by the code.*

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a deep copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Define the target `pattern_region` as `[[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]` and its location as rows 4-6, columns 4-6 (0-indexed, slice `[4:7, 4:7]`).
3.  Extract the actual 3x3 subgrid from the `input_grid` at the target location.
4.  Check if the extracted subgrid matches the `pattern_region`.
5.  If the pattern matches:
    a.  Identify the 12 `border_neighbor` cells surrounding the `pattern_region`.
    b.  Count the number of cells with value `6` among these 12 `border_neighbor` cells (`count6`).
    c.  Determine the `transformed_pattern` based on `count6`:
        i.  If `count6` is 0, set `transformed_pattern` to `[[9,9,9],[9,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.
        ii. Else if `count6` is 12, set `transformed_pattern` to `[[9,9,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.
        iii. Else (if `0 < count6 < 12`), set `transformed_pattern` to `[[9,9,9],[9,9,9],[9,9,9]]`.
    d.  Update the corresponding 3x3 region in the `output_grid` with the `transformed_pattern`.
6.  Return the `output_grid`. (Note: This program only describes the transformation of the central pattern based on its neighbors, as implemented in the evaluated code. It does not account for the secondary `9` to `7` changes observed in the expected outputs of Examples 1 and 3).
