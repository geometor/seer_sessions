It distinguishes between three primary modes:\n\n1.  **Analyze Signal:** Examine the input grid to find all occurrences of the number 7. Determine the following properties:\n    *   Does any row consist entirely of 7s?\n    *   Are there any 7s in the first row (row 0)? If yes, find the minimum column index (`min_c_first_row`).\n    *   Are there any 7s in the last row (row H-1)? If yes, find the minimum column index (`min_c_last_row`).\n    *   Find the overall minimum column index (`min_c`) where any 7 appears.\n2.  **Determine Transformation Mode:**\n    *   **Mode A:** If any row consists entirely of 7s.\n    *   **Mode B:** If Mode A is not met, AND (there is a 7 in the first row OR there is a 7 in the last row).\n    *   **Mode C:** If Mode A and Mode B are not met, but 7s are present in the grid.\n    *   **(Default):** If no 7s are present, return the input grid unchanged.\n3.  **Execute Transformation based on Mode:**\n    *   **If Mode A:**\n        a. Identify the set of indices `R_all_7` for all rows containing only 7s.\n        b. Identify the set of indices `R_sandwiched_1` for all rows that contain only 1s and are located vertically between any two rows whose indices are in `R_all_7`.\n        c. Construct the output grid by selecting all rows from the input grid whose indices are *not* in `R_all_7` and *not* in `R_sandwiched_1`, maintaining their original relative order.\n    *   **If Mode B:**\n        a. Calculate the target output width `W_out`:\n            i. If `min_c == min_c_last_row` (and `min_c_last_row` is finite): `W_out = min_c + 5`.\n            ii. Otherwise (meaning `min_c != min_c_last_row` or `min_c_last_row` is infinite, implies `min_c_first_row` must be relevant): `W_out = min_c_first_row - 1`.\n        b. Construct the output grid with the original number of rows and `W_out` columns.\n        c. **(Content Generation - Tentative):** Populate the output grid by taking the first `W_out` columns of the input grid and replacing any 7s found within this subgrid with 4s. *(Note: This content generation is a simplified hypothesis and likely incomplete based on example outputs.)*\n    *   **If Mode C:**\n        a. Identify the set of indices `R_any_7` for all rows containing at least one 7.\n        b. Create an intermediate grid by selecting all rows from the input grid whose indices are *not* in `R_any_7`, maintaining original relative order.\n        c. **(Modification and Extension - Missing):** The logic for modifying the content and extending the width of this intermediate grid is currently unknown and not implemented. The function currently returns only the result of step 3.c.a.\n4.  **Return Output:** Return the resulting grid.\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef find_value_coords(grid: np.ndarray, value: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"Finds all (row, col) coordinates of cells containing the specified value.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = np.where(grid == value)\n    return list(zip(rows, cols))\n\ndef get_rows_with_value(grid: np.ndarray, value: int) -> Set[int]:\n    \"\"\"Returns a set of row indices that contain the specified value.\"\"\"\n    coords = find_value_coords(grid, value)\n    return set(r for r, c in coords)\n\ndef is_row_all_value(row: np.ndarray, value: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Checks if a 1D numpy array (a row) contains only the specified value.\"\"\"\n    return row.size > 0 and np.all(row == value)\n\ndef find_sandwiched_rows(grid: np.ndarray, value_to_find: int, sandwiching_row_indices: Set[int]) -> Set[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds indices of rows that contain only `value_to_find` and are\n    vertically sandwiched between rows specified by `sandwiching_row_indices`.\n    \"\"\"\n    sandwiched_indices = set()\n    if not sandwiching_row_indices:\n        return sandwiched_indices\n\n    sorted_sandwich_indices = sorted(list(sandwiching_row_indices))\n    min_sandwich_r = sorted_sandwich_indices[0]\n    max_sandwich_r = sorted_sandwich_indices[-1]\n\n    for r_idx in range(min_sandwich_r + 1, max_sandwich_r):\n        # Check if the row itself is one of the sandwiching rows\n        if r_idx in sandwiching_row_indices:\n            continue\n\n        # Check if the row contains only the target value (e.g., 1)\n        if is_row_all_value(grid[r_idx, :], value_to_find):\n            # Check if there exists a sandwiching row strictly above and strictly below it\n            # Since we iterate between min and max sandwich rows, this is implicitly true\n            # if the row is not itself a sandwiching row.\n             sandwiched_indices.add(r_idx)\n\n    return sandwiched_indices\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    # Handle empty input\n    if not input_grid or not input_grid[0]:\n        return []\n\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    output_grid_np = None\n\n    # 1.
