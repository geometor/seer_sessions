Identify the set `R_all_7`.\n        b. Identify the set `R_sandwiched_1` (rows containing only 1s located vertically strictly between any two rows from `R_all_7`).\n        c. Construct the output grid by taking all rows from the input grid whose indices are *not* in `R_all_7` and *not* in `R_sandwiched_1`, maintaining their original relative order. *(This mode is fully understood and implemented).*\n    *   **If Mode B:**\n        a. Calculate the target output width `W_out`:\n            i. If `min_c_last_row` exists and `min_c == min_c_last_row`: `W_out = min_c + 5`.\n            ii. Else (`min_c_first_row` must exist): `W_out = min_c_first_row - 1`.\n        b. Create an output grid structure with the same number of rows as the input and `W_out` columns.\n        c. **Populate Content (Partially Understood):** Fill the output grid. The content is based on the first `W_out` columns of the input grid but requires complex, context-dependent modifications. *The exact rules for these modifications are currently unknown; simple 7->4 replacement is insufficient.*\n    *   **If Mode C:**\n        a. **Remove Rows (Understood):** Identify the set `R_any_7`. Create an intermediate grid by taking all rows from the input grid whose indices are *not* in `R_any_7`, maintaining their original relative order.\n        b. **Modify and Extend (Unknown):** Apply modifications to the content of the intermediate grid and extend its width by appending new columns to the right. *The rules for how to modify the content and what data to append for the extension are currently unknown and not implemented.*\n4.  **Return Output:** Return the resulting grid. Note that for Modes B and C, the output may be inaccurate or incomplete due to the unknown rules described above.\n\"\"\"\n\n\n# --- Helper Functions ---\n\ndef find_value_coords(grid: np.ndarray, value: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"Finds all (row, col) coordinates of cells containing the specified value.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = np.where(grid == value)\n    return list(zip(rows, cols))\n\ndef is_row_all_value(row: np.ndarray, value: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Checks if a 1D numpy array (a row) contains only the specified value.\"\"\"\n    # Ensure row is not empty before checking all elements\n    return row.size > 0 and np.all(row == value)\n\ndef find_sandwiched_rows(grid: np.ndarray, value_to_find: int, sandwiching_row_indices: Set[int]) -> Set[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds indices of rows that contain only `value_to_find` and are\n    vertically strictly between rows specified by `sandwiching_row_indices`.\n    \"\"\"\n    sandwiched_indices = set()\n    # Need at least two sandwiching rows to have anything in between\n    if len(sandwiching_row_indices) < 2:\n        return sandwiched_indices\n\n    # Sort the sandwiching row indices to find the min and max range\n    sorted_sandwich_indices = sorted(list(sandwiching_row_indices))\n    min_sandwich_r = sorted_sandwich_indices[0]\n    max_sandwich_r = sorted_sandwich_indices[-1]\n\n    # Iterate through rows strictly between the outer sandwiching rows\n    for r_idx in range(min_sandwich_r + 1, max_sandwich_r):\n        # Check if the row itself is one of the sandwiching rows\n        if r_idx in sandwiching_row_indices:\n            continue\n\n        # Check if the row contains only the target value (e.g., 1)\n        if is_row_all_value(grid[r_idx, :], value_to_find):\n            # Check if it's between *any* two sandwiching rows.\n            # This check ensures it's not just below the first or above the last\n            # without being truly between two.\n            is_sandwiched = False\n            for r1 in sorted_sandwich_indices:\n                for r2 in sorted_sandwich_indices:\n                    if r1 < r_idx < r2:\n                        is_sandwiched = True\n                        break\n                if is_sandwiched:\n                    break\n            \n            if is_sandwiched:\n                sandwiched_indices.add(r_idx)\n\n    return sandwiched_indices\n\n\n# --- Main Transformation Function ---\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule based on the presence and location of the number 7.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Handle empty input\n    if not input_grid or not input_grid[0]:\n        return []\n\n    # Convert to NumPy array for easier manipulation\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    output_grid_np = None # Initialize output grid\n\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze Signal (Find 7s and their properties) ---\n    coords_7 = find_value_coords(grid, 7)\n    rows_with_any_7 = set(r for r, c in coords_7)\n\n    # Check if any 7s exist at all\n    if not coords_7:\n        # --- Mode None: No 7s ---\n        return input_grid # Return input grid unchanged\n\n    # Calculate properties needed for mode determination\n    rows_all_7 = set()\n    for r_idx in range(height):\n        if is_row_all_value(grid[r_idx, :], 7):\n            rows_all_7.add(r_idx)\n\n    is_in_first_row = 0 in rows_with_any_7\n    is_in_last_row = (height -
