elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - representation: 2D array of integers
      - colors: [1, 4, 7] (7 is signal)
      - dimensions: height (H), width (W)
  - object: color_7
    properties:
      - role: primary signal, instruction marker
      - characteristic: transient (absent in output)
      - location_properties:
          - exists: boolean
          - coords: list of (row, col) tuples
          - rows_with_any_7: set of row indices
          - rows_all_7: set of row indices containing only 7s
          - is_in_first_row: boolean (row 0 has a 7)
          - is_in_last_row: boolean (row H-1 has a 7)
          - first_col_any_7 (min_c): min column index of any 7
          - first_col_row_0 (min_c_first_row): min column index of 7 in row 0
          - first_col_row_H-1 (min_c_last_row): min column index of 7 in last row

actions:
  - action: analyze_signal
    actor: transformation process
    input: input grid
    output: color_7 location_properties
  - action: determine_transformation_mode
    actor: transformation process
    input: color_7 location_properties
    output: mode ('A', 'B', 'C', 'None')
    logic:
      - If not color_7.exists -> Mode 'None'
      - Else if color_7.rows_all_7 is not empty -> Mode 'A'
      - Else if color_7.is_in_first_row OR color_7.is_in_last_row -> Mode 'B'
      - Else -> Mode 'C'
  - action: execute_mode_A # Row removal (all-7, sandwiched-1)
    actor: transformation process
    input: input grid, signal properties (rows_all_7)
    output: output grid
    status: Implemented and verified (Example 3).
    logic:
      - Identify `R_all_7 = color_7.rows_all_7`.
      - Identify `R_sandwiched_1` (rows of all 1s between rows in `R_all_7`).
      - Remove rows in `R_all_7` union `R_sandwiched_1`.
  - action: execute_mode_B # Boundary 7 -> Width adjustment + Complex modification
    actor: transformation process
    input: input grid, signal properties (min_c, min_c_first_row, min_c_last_row)
    output: output grid
    status: Partially implemented. Width calculation verified (Examples 1, 2). Content generation rule is UNKNOWN and current implementation (slice + 7->4 replace) is INCORRECT.
    logic:
      - Calculate output width `W_out`:
          - If `min_c_last_row` exists and `min_c == min_c_last_row`: `W_out = min_c + 5`
          - Else (`min_c_first_row` must exist): `W_out = min_c_first_row - 1`
      - Create output grid of size (H, W_out).
      - Populate content: Slice `input_grid[:, :W_out]`. Apply complex, context-dependent modifications within this slice (exact rules TBD).
  - action: execute_mode_C # Non-boundary, non-all-7 -> Row removal + Unknown modification/extension
    actor: transformation process
    input: input grid, signal properties (rows_with_any_7)
    output: output grid
    status: Partially implemented. Row removal verified (Example 4). Content modification and width extension rules are UNKNOWN and NOT implemented.
    logic:
      - Step 1 (Implemented): Identify `R_any_7 = color_7.rows_with_any_7`. Create intermediate grid by removing rows in `R_any_7`.
      - Step 2 (Not Implemented): Apply unknown modifications to the intermediate grid content. Extend the width of the intermediate grid by appending columns based on unknown rules.
  - action: execute_mode_None # No 7s
    actor: transformation process
    input: input grid
    output: output grid (identical to input)
    status: Implemented (by default if no 7s found).
