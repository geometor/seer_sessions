## General Assessment

The analysis confirms the previous findings:
1.  **Mode Identification:** The logic for distinguishing between Mode A (all-7 rows), Mode B (boundary row 7s), and Mode C (other 7s) appears correct based on the examples.
2.  **Mode A Execution:** The logic for Mode A (removing all-7 rows and sandwiched all-1 rows) successfully solves Example 3.
3.  **Mode B Execution:** The width calculation logic for Mode B seems correct for Examples 1 and 2, producing outputs of the expected dimensions. However, the content generation logic (currently a simple slice and 7->4 replacement) is inaccurate, failing to replicate the specific pixel values in the expected outputs. The required modifications are more complex and context-dependent.
4.  **Mode C Execution:** The code correctly performs the first step of Mode C (removing rows containing any 7s) as seen in Example 4. However, it completely lacks the second required step: modifying the remaining grid content and extending its width. The rules for this modification and extension are not yet determined.

**Strategy:**
The primary strategy remains to accurately document the known and unknown aspects of the transformation.
1.  Maintain the existing logic for mode identification and Mode A execution.
2.  Maintain the width calculation logic for Mode B, but clearly state in the documentation (YAML facts, Natural Language Program) that the content generation rule is currently unknown and the implemented placeholder (7->4 replacement) is insufficient.
3.  For Mode C, clearly state that the process involves row removal followed by modification and width extension, explicitly noting that the rules for the modification/extension step are unknown and not implemented.
4.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect this updated understanding with precision, highlighting the unsolved components.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Analyze Signal:** Examine the input grid for the number 7.
    *   If no 7s exist, proceed to step 3 (Mode None).
    *   If 7s exist, determine:
        *   The set of row indices containing *only* 7s (`rows_all_7`).
        *   Whether the first row (index 0) contains a 7 (`is_in_first_row`) and its minimum column index (`min_c_first_row`).
        *   Whether the last row (index H-1) contains a 7 (`is_in_last_row`) and its minimum column index (`min_c_last_row`).
        *   The overall minimum column index of any 7 (`min_c`).
        *   The set of all row indices containing at least one 7 (`rows_with_any_7`).
2.  **Determine Transformation Mode:**
    *   **Mode A:** If `rows_all_7` is not empty.
    *   **Mode B:** If Mode A is not met, AND (`is_in_first_row` is true OR `is_in_last_row` is true).
    *   **Mode C:** If Modes A and B are not met (but 7s exist).
    *   **Mode None:** If no 7s were found in step 1.
3.  **Execute Transformation based on Mode:**
    *   **If Mode None:** Return the input grid unchanged.
    *   **If Mode A:**
        a. Identify the set `R_all_7`.
        b. Identify the set `R_sandwiched_1` (rows containing only 1s located vertically strictly between any two rows from `R_all_7`).
        c. Construct the output grid by taking all rows from the input grid whose indices are *not* in `R_all_7` and *not* in `R_sandwiched_1`, maintaining their original relative order. *(This mode is fully understood and implemented).*
    *   **If Mode B:**
        a. Calculate the target output width `W_out`:
            i. If `min_c_last_row` exists and `min_c == min_c_last_row`: `W_out = min_c + 5`.
            ii. Else (`min_c_first_row` must exist): `W_out = min_c_first_row - 1`.
        b. Create an output grid structure with the same number of rows as the input and `W_out` columns.
        c. **Populate Content (Partially Understood):** Fill the output grid. The content is based on the first `W_out` columns of the input grid but requires complex, context-dependent modifications. *The exact rules for these modifications are currently unknown; simple 7->4 replacement is insufficient.*
    *   **If Mode C:**
        a. **Remove Rows (Understood):** Identify the set `R_any_7`. Create an intermediate grid by taking all rows from the input grid whose indices are *not* in `R_any_7`, maintaining their original relative order.
        b. **Modify and Extend (Unknown):** Apply modifications to the content of the intermediate grid and extend its width by appending new columns to the right. *The rules for how to modify the content and what data to append for the extension are currently unknown and not implemented.*
4.  **Return Output:** Return the resulting grid. Note that for Modes B and C, the output may be inaccurate or incomplete due to the unknown rules described above.
