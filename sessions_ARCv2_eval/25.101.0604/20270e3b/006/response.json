However, the content generation logic (currently a simple slice and 7->4 replacement) is inaccurate, failing to replicate the specific pixel values in the expected outputs. The required modifications are more complex and context-dependent.\n4.  **Mode C Execution:** The code correctly performs the first step of Mode C (removing rows containing any 7s) as seen in Example 4. However, it completely lacks the second required step: modifying the remaining grid content and extending its width. The rules for this modification and extension are not yet determined.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe primary strategy remains to accurately document the known and unknown aspects of the transformation.\n1.  Maintain the existing logic for mode identification and Mode A execution.\n2.  Maintain the width calculation logic for Mode B, but clearly state in the documentation (YAML facts, Natural Language Program) that the content generation rule is currently unknown and the implemented placeholder (7->4 replacement) is insufficient.\n3.  For Mode C, clearly state that the process involves row removal followed by modification and width extension, explicitly noting that the rules for the modification/extension step are unknown and not implemented.\n4.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect this updated understanding with precision, highlighting the unsolved components.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example | Mode Triggered | Input Size  | Code Output Size | Expected Output Size | Size Match | Pixels Off (if size match) | Correct | Key Reason for Discrepancy                                                                      |\n| :------ | :------------- | :---------- | :--------------- | :------------------- | :--------- | :------------------------- | :------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | B              | (7, 13)     | (7, 8)           | (7, 8)               | True       | 7                          | False   | Mode B content generation incorrect (simple 7->4 replace failed)                                |\n| 2       | B              | (7, 13)     | (7, 6)           | (7, 6)               | True       | 3                          | False   | Mode B content generation incorrect (simple 7->4 replace failed)                                |\n| 3       | A              | (9, 3)      | (6, 3)           | (6, 3)               | True       | 0                          | True    | Mode A logic (remove all-7 and sandwiched all-1 rows) correctly applied.                     |\n| 4       | C              | (7, 9)      | (5, 9)           | (5, 12)              | False      | N/A                        | False   | Mode C logic incomplete: only row removal was performed; modification/extension was missing. |\n\n## Facts\n\n```yaml\nelements:\n  - object: grid\n    properties:\n      - representation: 2D array of integers\n      - colors: [1, 4, 7] (7 is signal)\n      - dimensions: height (H), width (W)\n  - object: color_7\n    properties:\n      - role: primary signal, instruction marker\n      - characteristic: transient (absent in output)\n      - location_properties:\n          - exists: boolean\n          - coords: list of (row, col) tuples\n          - rows_with_any_7: set of row indices\n          - rows_all_7: set of row indices containing only 7s\n          - is_in_first_row: boolean (row 0 has a 7)\n          - is_in_last_row: boolean (row H-1 has a 7)\n          - first_col_any_7 (min_c): min column index of any 7\n          - first_col_row_0 (min_c_first_row): min column index of 7 in row 0\n          - first_col_row_H-1 (min_c_last_row): min column index of 7 in last row\n\nactions:\n  - action: analyze_signal\n    actor: transformation process\n    input: input grid\n    output: color_7 location_properties\n  - action: determine_transformation_mode\n    actor: transformation process\n    input: color_7 location_properties\n    output: mode ('A', 'B', 'C', 'None')\n    logic:\n      - If not color_7.exists -> Mode 'None'\n      - Else if color_7.rows_all_7 is not empty -> Mode 'A'\n      - Else if color_7.is_in_first_row OR color_7.is_in_last_row -> Mode 'B'\n      - Else -> Mode 'C'\n  - action: execute_mode_A # Row removal (all-7, sandwiched-1)\n    actor: transformation process\n    input: input grid, signal properties (rows_all_7)\n    output: output grid\n    status: Implemented and verified (Example 3).\n    logic:\n      - Identify `R_all_7 = color_7.rows_all_7`.\n      - Identify `R_sandwiched_1` (rows of all 1s between rows in `R_all_7`).\n      - Remove rows in `R_all_7` union `R_sandwiched_1`.\n  - action: execute_mode_B # Boundary 7 -> Width adjustment + Complex modification\n    actor: transformation process\n    input: input grid, signal properties (min_c, min_c_first_row, min_c_last_row)\n    output: output grid\n    status: Partially implemented.

Construct the output grid by taking all rows from the input grid whose indices are *not* in `R_all_7` and *not* in `R_sandwiched_1`, maintaining their original relative order. *(This mode is fully understood and implemented).*\n    *   **If Mode B:**\n        a.

Else (`min_c_first_row` must exist): `W_out = min_c_first_row - 1`.\n        b. Create an output grid structure with the same number of rows as the input and `W_out` columns.\n        c. **Populate Content (Partially Understood):** Fill the output grid.

Create an intermediate grid by taking all rows from the input grid whose indices are *not* in `R_any_7`, maintaining their original relative order.\n        b. **Modify and Extend (Unknown):** Apply modifications to the content of the intermediate grid and extend its width by appending new columns to the right. *The rules for how to modify the content and what data to append for the extension are currently unknown and not implemented.*\n4.  **Return Output:** Return the resulting grid.
