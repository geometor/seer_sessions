## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of numbers (colors).
2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors used are 1, 4, and 7. Color 4 often appears as a background or frame color. Color 1 appears as a foreground or fill color. Color 7 seems to be a special marker or signal, not part of the final output pattern.
3.  **Transformation Signal:** The presence and position of the number '7' heavily influence the transformation. The number '7' itself is consistently absent from the output grid.
4.  **Dimensional Changes:** The dimensions (height and width) of the grid often change between input and output.
    *   Height can decrease (train_3, train_4).
    *   Width can decrease (train_1, train_2).
    *   Width can increase (train_4).
5.  **Row Operations:** In some examples (train_3, train_4), rows containing the number '7' are removed from the input to produce the output. In train_3, a row containing only '1's situated between two rows containing '7's is also removed.
6.  **Column Operations:** In other examples (train_1, train_2), the output grid appears to be a horizontally cropped version of the input grid, possibly after some modification related to the '7's. The exact cropping logic is not immediately clear but might relate to the column index of the first '7'.
7.  **Element Replacement:** In the cases involving cropping (train_1, train_2), the '7's might be conceptually replaced (e.g., with '4') before or during the cropping, although simple replacement doesn't fully explain the output patterns.
8.  **Grid Extension:** In train_4, besides row removal, the width of the remaining rows increases, suggesting data is appended to the rows. The source of this appended data is unclear but might relate to the content of the removed rows or columns containing '7'.
9.  **Conditional Logic:** The transformation rule appears conditional, potentially branching based on the specific configuration or location of the '7's (e.g., whether they appear in the first/last row, whether they span multiple rows/columns in specific ways, or if entire rows consist only of '7's).

## Facts

```yaml
elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - representation: 2D array of integers
      - colors: [1, 4, 7] (potentially others, but these are key)
      - dimensions: height (rows), width (columns)
  - object: color_7
    properties:
      - role: signal, marker, instruction
      - characteristic: transient (present in input, absent in output)
      - location: specific cell coordinates (row, column)

actions:
  - action: identify_signal_locations
    actor: transformation process
    input: input grid
    output: set of coordinates [(r1, c1), (r2, c2), ...] where the value is 7
  - action: determine_transformation_type
    actor: transformation process
    input: locations of color_7, grid properties (e.g., dimensions)
    output: type of operation (e.g., row_removal, column_crop_modify, row_removal_and_extension)
    logic_notes: The specific condition distinguishing the types is not fully clear. Possibilities include: presence of 7 in edge rows/columns, presence of rows solely consisting of 7s, etc.
  - action: remove_rows
    actor: transformation process
    input: input grid, rows_to_remove (identified based on color_7 presence, potentially including adjacent all-'1' rows)
    output: intermediate grid (reduced height)
  - action: modify_and_crop_columns
    actor: transformation process
    input: input grid (or modified version where 7s are replaced), target_width (potentially calculated based on first column containing 7)
    output: intermediate grid (reduced width, potentially modified content)
  - action: extend_rows
    actor: transformation process
    input: intermediate grid (after row removal), extension_data (source unclear, maybe from removed rows/columns)
    output: final grid (increased width)
  - action: replace_signal_color
    actor: transformation process
    input: grid, coordinates containing 7
    output: grid with 7 replaced by another color (e.g., 4) - this might be a sub-step within modify_and_crop_columns.

relationships:
  - relationship: controls
    subject: color_7 location(s)
    object: transformation_type selection
  - relationship: defines
    subject: color_7 location(s)
    object: rows_to_remove (in row_removal type)
  - relationship: defines
    subject: color_7 location(s) (e.g., first column index)
    object: target_width (in column_crop_modify type)
  - relationship: determines
    subject: transformation_type
    object: sequence of actions (e.g., remove_rows only vs. modify_and_crop_columns vs remove_rows then extend_rows)
```

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Analyze Signal:** Identify all cells in the input grid containing the number 7. Note their row and column indices.
2.  **Determine Operation Mode:** Based on the pattern and location of the 7s, determine the primary operation mode:
    *   **Mode A (Row Removal):** This mode seems active when 7s are present but potentially *not* in the first or last row (or perhaps triggered by other conditions like entire rows of 7s, observed in train_3, or just non-edge presence as in train_4).
    *   **Mode B (Column Crop/Modify):** This mode seems active when 7s *are* present in the first or last row (train_1, train_2).
    *   **Mode C (Row Removal + Extension):** This mode seems active in train_4, involving both row removal and subsequent width extension. (This might be a variation of Mode A).
3.  **Execute Operation:**
    *   **If Mode A (Row Removal):**
        a. Identify all rows `R_7` that contain at least one 7.
        b. Identify all rows `R_1_sandwiched` that consist entirely of 1s and are located vertically between two rows belonging to `R_7`.
        c. Create the output grid by taking all rows from the input grid *except* those in `R_7` and `R_1_sandwiched`, maintaining their original order.
    *   **If Mode B (Column Crop/Modify):**
        a. Find the minimum column index `min_c` where a 7 appears in any row.
        b. Calculate the target output width `W_out = min_c + 5`.
        c. Create a temporary copy of the input grid.
        d. In the temporary grid, replace all occurrences of 7 with 4.
        e. Create the output grid by taking only the first `W_out` columns from the modified temporary grid. (*Note: This step doesn't perfectly match outputs for train_1 and train_2, suggesting the modification/cropping logic might be more complex.*)
    *   **If Mode C (Row Removal + Extension):**
        a. Perform the row removal step as described in Mode A (remove rows with 7).
        b. Determine the necessary extension width and the data to append to each remaining row. (*Note: The logic for determining the appended data and width extension based on the input and removed rows/columns is not clear from the examples.*)
        c. Append the determined data to the right side of each remaining row to form the final output grid.
4.  **Final Output:** The grid resulting from the selected operation mode is the final output.
```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Tuple, Set

"""
The transformation rule distinguishes between two primary modes based on the location of the number 7 in the input grid.

1.  **Analyze Signal:** Identify all cells containing the number 7.
2.  **Determine Operation Mode:**
    *   **Mode A (Row Removal):** If no 7s are present in the first row (row 0) or the last row.
    *   **Mode B (Column Crop):** If any 7 is present in the first row or the last row.
3.  **Execute Operation:**
    *   **If Mode A:**
        a. Identify the set of row indices `R_7` that contain at least one 7.
        b. Identify the set of row indices `R_1_sandwiched` corresponding to rows that:
            i. Consist entirely of the number 1.
            ii. Are located strictly between two rows whose indices are in `R_7`. (e.g., row `r` is sandwiched if `r1 < r < r2` for some `r1, r2` in `R_7`, and row `r` contains only 1s).
        c. Construct the output grid by keeping all rows from the input grid whose indices are *not* in `R_7` and *not* in `R_1_sandwiched`, maintaining their original relative order.
        d. (Note: The extension observed in train_4 is not implemented in this version).
    *   **If Mode B:**
        a. Find the minimum column index `min_c` where a 7 appears in *any* row.
        b. Construct the output grid by taking only the first `min_c` columns from each row of the *original* input grid.
        c. (Note: This is a simplified interpretation for Mode B based on observations; it doesn't perfectly match train_1 and train_2 outputs and needs refinement).
4.  **Final Output:** The grid resulting from the selected operation mode.

## General Assessment

The previous code successfully implemented Mode A (Row Removal based on all-7 rows and sandwiched all-1 rows), correctly solving Example 3. However, it failed on Examples 1, 2, and 4, which fall into different transformation categories (tentatively Mode B and Mode C).

*   **Mode B (Examples 1, 2):** Triggered by 7s in the first or last row. The previous code used a simple column crop based on the first occurrence of 7 (`min_c`), which was incorrect for both width and content. The analysis suggests the output width might depend specifically on the first 7 in the *first* row or the first 7 in the *last* row, using different formulas (`W = min_c_first_row - 1` or `W = min_c_last_row + 5`). However, generating the *content* for this width is complex and involves more than simple cropping or replacing 7s with 4s. It appears context-dependent modifications occur within the selected columns.
*   **Mode C (Example 4):** Triggered by 7s present only in non-boundary rows, where those rows are *not* entirely composed of 7s. The previous code only removed rows containing 7s, failing to account for the observed width extension and content modification in the remaining rows. The transformation in this mode appears to involve:
    1.  Removing rows with 7s.
    2.  Modifying the content of the remaining rows.
    3.  Extending the width of the remaining rows. The source and logic for modification and extension are unclear.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Mode Identification:** Use the updated criteria based on whether rows consist *entirely* of 7s and whether 7s appear in boundary rows.
2.  **Maintain Mode A Logic:** The logic for removing all-7 rows and sandwiched all-1 rows works for Example 3 and should be kept.
3.  **Refine Mode B Logic:** Implement the hypothesized width calculation. For content, start with the assumption of taking the first `W_out` columns and replacing 7s with 4s, acknowledging this is likely incomplete and needs further refinement based on pattern analysis of the specific changes observed within those columns.
4.  **Refine Mode C Logic:** Implement the row removal step (removing rows with *any* 7s). Acknowledge that modification and extension are needed but the rules are not yet determined. For now, the output for this mode will be incomplete (only row removal).
5.  **Update Documentation:** Reflect the refined modes, actions, and known limitations in the YAML facts and natural language program.

## Metrics

**Example 1:**
*   Mode: B (7 in row 0)
*   Code Output Size: (7, 3)
*   Expected Output Size: (7, 8)
*   Code Correctness: Failed (Incorrect size and content)
*   Reason: Incorrect Mode B logic (simple crop at `min_c=3`). Needs correct width (`W=8`) and complex content generation.

**Example 2:**
*   Mode: B (7 in row 0 and row 6)
*   Code Output Size: (7, 1)
*   Expected Output Size: (7, 6)
*   Code Correctness: Failed (Incorrect size and content)
*   Reason: Incorrect Mode B logic (simple crop at `min_c=1`). Needs correct width (`W=6`) and complex content generation (though some rows match `grid[:,:6]`).

**Example 3:**
*   Mode: A (Rows 3 and 5 are all 7s)
*   Code Output Size: (6, 3)
*   Expected Output Size: (6, 3)
*   Code Correctness: Success
*   Reason: Mode A logic (remove all-7 rows and sandwiched all-1 rows) correctly applied.

**Example 4:**
*   Mode: C (7s present, not all-7 rows, not in boundary rows)
*   Code Output Size: (5, 9)
*   Expected Output Size: (5, 12)
*   Code Correctness: Failed (Incorrect size and content)
*   Reason: Mode C logic incomplete. Code only removed rows with 7s ({4, 5}), but did not perform necessary content modification and width extension.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Analyze Signal:** Examine the input grid to find all occurrences of the number 7. Determine the following properties:
    *   Does any row consist entirely of 7s?
    *   Are there any 7s in the first row (row 0)? If yes, find the minimum column index (`min_c_first_row`).
    *   Are there any 7s in the last row (row H-1)? If yes, find the minimum column index (`min_c_last_row`).
    *   Find the overall minimum column index (`min_c`) where any 7 appears.
2.  **Determine Transformation Mode:**
    *   **Mode A:** If any row consists entirely of 7s.
    *   **Mode B:** If Mode A is not met, AND (there is a 7 in the first row OR there is a 7 in the last row).
    *   **Mode C:** If Mode A and Mode B are not met, but 7s are present in the grid.
    *   **(Default):** If no 7s are present, return the input grid unchanged.
3.  **Execute Transformation based on Mode:**
    *   **If Mode A:**
        a. Identify the set of indices `R_all_7` for all rows containing only 7s.
        b. Identify the set of indices `R_sandwiched_1` for all rows that contain only 1s and are located vertically between any two rows whose indices are in `R_all_7`.
        c. Construct the output grid by selecting all rows from the input grid whose indices are *not* in `R_all_7` and *not* in `R_sandwiched_1`, maintaining their original relative order.
    *   **If Mode B:**
        a. Calculate the target output width `W_out`:
            i. If `min_c == min_c_last_row` (and `min_c_last_row` is finite): `W_out = min_c + 5`.
            ii. Otherwise: `W_out = min_c_first_row - 1`.
        b. Construct the output grid with the original number of rows and `W_out` columns.
        c. **(Content Generation - Complex/Uncertain):** Populate the output grid. The content seems derived from the first `W_out` columns of the input grid, but involves specific modifications and replacements (e.g., replacing 7s, potentially changing other numbers based on context) that are not fully captured by a simple rule like "replace all 7s with 4s". *Further analysis is needed to define the exact content generation rules.*
    *   **If Mode C:**
        a. Identify the set of indices `R_any_7` for all rows containing at least one 7.
        b. Create an intermediate grid by selecting all rows from the input grid whose indices are *not* in `R_any_7`, maintaining original relative order.
        c. **(Modification and Extension - Complex/Uncertain):** Modify the content of the intermediate grid and extend its width. The rules for modification and the source/content of the extended columns are currently unknown and require further analysis. *The current implementation might only perform step 3.c.a.*
4.  **Return Output:** Return the resulting grid.

The transformation rule operates based on the presence and configuration of the number 7 within the input grid. It distinguishes between three primary modes:

1.  **Analyze Signal:** Examine the input grid to find all occurrences of the number 7. Determine the following properties:
    *   Does any row consist entirely of 7s?
    *   Are there any 7s in the first row (row 0)? If yes, find the minimum column index (`min_c_first_row`).
    *   Are there any 7s in the last row (row H-1)? If yes, find the minimum column index (`min_c_last_row`).
    *   Find the overall minimum column index (`min_c`) where any 7 appears.
2.  **Determine Transformation Mode:**
    *   **Mode A:** If any row consists entirely of 7s.
    *   **Mode B:** If Mode A is not met, AND (there is a 7 in the first row OR there is a 7 in the last row).
    *   **Mode C:** If Mode A and Mode B are not met, but 7s are present in the grid.
    *   **(Default):** If no 7s are present, return the input grid unchanged.
3.  **Execute Transformation based on Mode:**
    *   **If Mode A:**
        a. Identify the set of indices `R_all_7` for all rows containing only 7s.
        b. Identify the set of indices `R_sandwiched_1` for all rows that contain only 1s and are located vertically between any two rows whose indices are in `R_all_7`.

            i. If `min_c == min_c_last_row` (and `min_c_last_row` is finite): `W_out = min_c + 5`.
            ii. Otherwise (meaning `min_c != min_c_last_row` or `min_c_last_row` is infinite, implies `min_c_first_row` must be relevant): `W_out = min_c_first_row - 1`.
        b. Construct the output grid with the original number of rows and `W_out` columns.
        c. **(Content Generation - Tentative):** Populate the output grid by taking the first `W_out` columns of the input grid and replacing any 7s found within this subgrid with 4s. *(Note: This content generation is a simplified hypothesis and likely incomplete based on example outputs.)*
    *   **If Mode C:**
        a. Identify the set of indices `R_any_7` for all rows containing at least one 7.
        b. Create an intermediate grid by selecting all rows from the input grid whose indices are *not* in `R_any_7`, maintaining original relative order.
        c. **(Modification and Extension - Missing):** The logic for modifying the content and extending the width of this intermediate grid is currently unknown and not implemented. The function currently returns only the result of step 3.c.a.
4.  **Return Output:** Return the resulting grid.

"""
The transformation rule operates based on the presence and configuration of the number 7 within the input grid. It distinguishes between three primary modes:

1.  **Analyze Signal:** Examine the input grid to find all occurrences of the number 7. Determine the following properties:
    *   Does any row consist entirely of 7s?
    *   Are there any 7s in the first row (row 0)? If yes, find the minimum column index (`min_c_first_row`).
    *   Are there any 7s in the last row (row H-1)? If yes, find the minimum column index (`min_c_last_row`).
    *   Find the overall minimum column index (`min_c`) where any 7 appears.
2.  **Determine Transformation Mode:**
    *   **Mode A:** If any row consists entirely of 7s.
    *   **Mode B:** If Mode A is not met, AND (there is a 7 in the first row OR there is a 7 in the last row).
    *   **Mode C:** If Mode A and Mode B are not met, but 7s are present in the grid.
    *   **(Default):** If no 7s are present, return the input grid unchanged.
3.  **Execute Transformation based on Mode:**
    *   **If Mode A:**
        a. Identify the set of indices `R_all_7` for all rows containing only 7s.
        b. Identify the set of indices `R_sandwiched_1` for all rows that contain only 1s and are located vertically between any two rows whose indices are in `R_all_7`.
        c. Construct the output grid by selecting all rows from the input grid whose indices are *not* in `R_all_7` and *not* in `R_sandwiched_1`, maintaining their original relative order.
    *   **If Mode B:**
        a. Calculate the target output width `W_out`:
            i. If `min_c == min_c_last_row` (and `min_c_last_row` is finite): `W_out = min_c + 5`.
            ii. Otherwise (meaning `min_c != min_c_last_row` or `min_c_last_row` is infinite, implies `min_c_first_row` must be relevant): `W_out = min_c_first_row - 1`.
        b. Construct the output grid with the original number of rows and `W_out` columns.
        c. **(Content Generation - Tentative):** Populate the output grid by taking the first `W_out` columns of the input grid and replacing any 7s found within this subgrid with 4s. *(Note: This content generation is a simplified hypothesis and likely incomplete based on example outputs.)*
    *   **If Mode C:**
        a. Identify the set of indices `R_any_7` for all rows containing at least one 7.
        b. Create an intermediate grid by selecting all rows from the input grid whose indices are *not* in `R_any_7`, maintaining original relative order.
        c. **(Modification and Extension - Missing):** The logic for modifying the content and extending the width of this intermediate grid is currently unknown and not implemented. The function currently returns only the result of step 3.c.a.
4.  **Return Output:** Return the resulting grid.

## General Assessment

The previous code correctly identified and implemented the logic for **Mode A** (row removal based on all-7 rows and sandwiched all-1 rows), successfully solving Example 3.

The code also correctly identified the conditions for **Mode B** (Examples 1 and 2) and **Mode C** (Example 4). However, the execution logic for these modes was incomplete or inaccurate:

*   **Mode B (Examples 1, 2):** The width calculation logic (`W_out = min_c_first_row - 1` or `W_out = min_c + 5`) appears correct for determining the output dimensions. However, the content generation step (tentatively implemented as slicing and replacing 7s with 4s) failed to reproduce the expected output accurately. The actual transformation within the selected columns is more complex and context-dependent, involving modifications beyond simple replacement. The rules for this modification are not yet fully understood.
*   **Mode C (Example 4):** The code correctly identified and removed the rows containing 7s. However, it completely missed the second part of the transformation observed in Example 4: the modification and extension (increasing the width) of the remaining rows. The rules governing how the grid is modified and which columns are appended are currently unknown.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Maintain Mode Logic:** Retain the established criteria for differentiating between Modes A, B, and C based on the configuration of 7s (all-7 rows, boundary row 7s, other 7s).
2.  **Refine Mode A:** Keep the implementation as it correctly solves Example 3.
3.  **Refine Mode B Description:** Update the description and facts to reflect that while the output width seems determined by the position of 7s in boundary rows, the content generation involves complex, context-specific modifications within those columns, not just simple 7-to-4 replacement. Acknowledge this part is not fully solved.
4.  **Refine Mode C Description:** Update the description and facts to explicitly state that Mode C involves two steps: (1) Removing rows containing any 7s, and (2) Modifying and extending the width of the remaining grid according to rules that are currently undetermined. Acknowledge the extension/modification part is not implemented.
5.  **Update Documentation:** Ensure the YAML facts and Natural Language Program accurately reflect these refined understandings and explicitly mention the unsolved aspects of Mode B content generation and Mode C modification/extension.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Analyze Signal:** Examine the input grid for the number 7. Determine if 7s exist. If they do, identify:
    *   The set of all row indices containing at least one 7 (`rows_with_any_7`).
    *   The set of row indices containing *only* 7s (`rows_all_7`).
    *   Whether the first row (index 0) contains a 7 (`is_in_first_row`) and, if so, the minimum column index (`min_c_first_row`).
    *   Whether the last row (index H-1) contains a 7 (`is_in_last_row`) and, if so, the minimum column index (`min_c_last_row`).
    *   The overall minimum column index of any 7 (`min_c`).
2.  **Determine Transformation Mode:**
    *   **Mode None:** If no 7s are found in the grid.
    *   **Mode A:** If the set `rows_all_7` is not empty.
    *   **Mode B:** If Mode A is not met, AND (`is_in_first_row` is true OR `is_in_last_row` is true).
    *   **Mode C:** If Modes A and B are not met, but 7s exist in the grid (`rows_with_any_7` is not empty).
3.  **Execute Transformation based on Mode:**
    *   **If Mode None:** Return the input grid unchanged.
    *   **If Mode A:**
        a. Identify the set `R_all_7` (rows containing only 7s).
        b. Identify the set `R_sandwiched_1` (rows containing only 1s that are located vertically between any two rows from `R_all_7`).
        c. Construct the output grid by taking all rows from the input grid whose indices are *not* in `R_all_7` and *not* in `R_sandwiched_1`, maintaining their original relative order.
    *   **If Mode B:**
        a. Calculate the target output width `W_out`:
            i. If `min_c_last_row` exists and `min_c == min_c_last_row`: `W_out = min_c + 5`.
            ii. Else (implies `min_c_first_row` must exist): `W_out = min_c_first_row - 1`.
        b. Create an output grid structure with the same number of rows as the input and `W_out` columns.
        c. **Populate Content (Complex):** Fill the output grid. The content is derived from the first `W_out` columns of the input grid but involves context-specific modifications that go beyond simple 7-to-4 replacement. *The precise rules for these modifications are not fully determined.*
    *   **If Mode C:**
        a. Identify the set `R_any_7` (all rows containing at least one 7).
        b. Create an intermediate grid by taking all rows from the input grid whose indices are *not* in `R_any_7`, maintaining their original relative order.
        c. **Modify and Extend (Complex):** Apply modifications to the content of this intermediate grid and extend its width by appending new columns to the right. *The rules for modification and the source/content of the appended columns are currently undetermined.*
4.  **Return Output:** Return the resulting grid based on the executed mode.
