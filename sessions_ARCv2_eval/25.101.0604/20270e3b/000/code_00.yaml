elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - representation: 2D array of integers
      - colors: [1, 4, 7] (potentially others, but these are key)
      - dimensions: height (rows), width (columns)
  - object: color_7
    properties:
      - role: signal, marker, instruction
      - characteristic: transient (present in input, absent in output)
      - location: specific cell coordinates (row, column)

actions:
  - action: identify_signal_locations
    actor: transformation process
    input: input grid
    output: set of coordinates [(r1, c1), (r2, c2), ...] where the value is 7
  - action: determine_transformation_type
    actor: transformation process
    input: locations of color_7, grid properties (e.g., dimensions)
    output: type of operation (e.g., row_removal, column_crop_modify, row_removal_and_extension)
    logic_notes: The specific condition distinguishing the types is not fully clear. Possibilities include: presence of 7 in edge rows/columns, presence of rows solely consisting of 7s, etc.
  - action: remove_rows
    actor: transformation process
    input: input grid, rows_to_remove (identified based on color_7 presence, potentially including adjacent all-'1' rows)
    output: intermediate grid (reduced height)
  - action: modify_and_crop_columns
    actor: transformation process
    input: input grid (or modified version where 7s are replaced), target_width (potentially calculated based on first column containing 7)
    output: intermediate grid (reduced width, potentially modified content)
  - action: extend_rows
    actor: transformation process
    input: intermediate grid (after row removal), extension_data (source unclear, maybe from removed rows/columns)
    output: final grid (increased width)
  - action: replace_signal_color
    actor: transformation process
    input: grid, coordinates containing 7
    output: grid with 7 replaced by another color (e.g., 4) - this might be a sub-step within modify_and_crop_columns.

relationships:
  - relationship: controls
    subject: color_7 location(s)
    object: transformation_type selection
  - relationship: defines
    subject: color_7 location(s)
    object: rows_to_remove (in row_removal type)
  - relationship: defines
    subject: color_7 location(s) (e.g., first column index)
    object: target_width (in column_crop_modify type)
  - relationship: determines
    subject: transformation_type
    object: sequence of actions (e.g., remove_rows only vs. modify_and_crop_columns vs remove_rows then extend_rows)
