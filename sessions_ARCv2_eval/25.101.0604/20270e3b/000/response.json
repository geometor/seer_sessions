Color 4 often appears as a background or frame color. Color 1 appears as a foreground or fill color. Color 7 seems to be a special marker or signal, not part of the final output pattern.\n3.  **Transformation Signal:** The presence and position of the number '7' heavily influence the transformation. The number '7' itself is consistently absent from the output grid.\n4.  **Dimensional Changes:** The dimensions (height and width) of the grid often change between input and output.\n    *   Height can decrease (train_3, train_4).\n    *   Width can decrease (train_1, train_2).\n    *   Width can increase (train_4).\n5.  **Row Operations:** In some examples (train_3, train_4), rows containing the number '7' are removed from the input to produce the output. In train_3, a row containing only '1's situated between two rows containing '7's is also removed.\n6.  **Column Operations:** In other examples (train_1, train_2), the output grid appears to be a horizontally cropped version of the input grid, possibly after some modification related to the '7's. The exact cropping logic is not immediately clear but might relate to the column index of the first '7'.\n7.  **Element Replacement:** In the cases involving cropping (train_1, train_2), the '7's might be conceptually replaced (e.g., with '4') before or during the cropping, although simple replacement doesn't fully explain the output patterns.\n8.  **Grid Extension:** In train_4, besides row removal, the width of the remaining rows increases, suggesting data is appended to the rows. The source of this appended data is unclear but might relate to the content of the removed rows or columns containing '7'.\n9.  **Conditional Logic:** The transformation rule appears conditional, potentially branching based on the specific configuration or location of the '7's (e.g., whether they appear in the first/last row, whether they span multiple rows/columns in specific ways, or if entire rows consist only of '7's).\n\n## Facts\n\n```yaml\nelements:\n  - object: grid\n    properties:\n      - representation: 2D array of integers\n      - colors: [1, 4, 7] (potentially others, but these are key)\n      - dimensions: height (rows), width (columns)\n  - object: color_7\n    properties:\n      - role: signal, marker, instruction\n      - characteristic: transient (present in input, absent in output)\n      - location: specific cell coordinates (row, column)\n\nactions:\n  - action: identify_signal_locations\n    actor: transformation process\n    input: input grid\n    output: set of coordinates [(r1, c1), (r2, c2), ...] where the value is 7\n  - action: determine_transformation_type\n    actor: transformation process\n    input: locations of color_7, grid properties (e.g., dimensions)\n    output: type of operation (e.g., row_removal, column_crop_modify, row_removal_and_extension)\n    logic_notes: The specific condition distinguishing the types is not fully clear.

Note their row and column indices.\n2.  **Determine Operation Mode:** Based on the pattern and location of the 7s, determine the primary operation mode:\n    *   **Mode A (Row Removal):** This mode seems active when 7s are present but potentially *not* in the first or last row (or perhaps triggered by other conditions like entire rows of 7s, observed in train_3, or just non-edge presence as in train_4).\n    *   **Mode B (Column Crop/Modify):** This mode seems active when 7s *are* present in the first or last row (train_1, train_2).\n    *   **Mode C (Row Removal + Extension):** This mode seems active in train_4, involving both row removal and subsequent width extension. (This might be a variation of Mode A).\n3.  **Execute Operation:**\n    *   **If Mode A (Row Removal):**\n        a. Identify all rows `R_7` that contain at least one 7.\n        b. Identify all rows `R_1_sandwiched` that consist entirely of 1s and are located vertically between two rows belonging to `R_7`.\n        c. Create the output grid by taking all rows from the input grid *except* those in `R_7` and `R_1_sandwiched`, maintaining their original order.\n    *   **If Mode B (Column Crop/Modify):**\n        a. Find the minimum column index `min_c` where a 7 appears in any row.\n        b. Calculate the target output width `W_out = min_c + 5`.\n        c. Create a temporary copy of the input grid.\n        d. In the temporary grid, replace all occurrences of 7 with 4.\n        e. Create the output grid by taking only the first `W_out` columns from the modified temporary grid. (*Note: This step doesn't perfectly match outputs for train_1 and train_2, suggesting the modification/cropping logic might be more complex.*)\n    *   **If Mode C (Row Removal + Extension):**\n        a. Perform the row removal step as described in Mode A (remove rows with 7).\n        b. Determine the necessary extension width and the data to append to each remaining row. (*Note: The logic for determining the appended data and width extension based on the input and removed rows/columns is not clear from the examples.*)\n        c. Append the determined data to the right side of each remaining row to form the final output grid.\n4.  **Final Output:** The grid resulting from the selected operation mode is the final output."
