            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly identified and implemented the logic for **Mode A** (row removal based on all-7 rows and sandwiched all-1 rows), successfully solving Example 3.\n\nThe code also correctly identified the conditions for **Mode B** (Examples 1 and 2) and **Mode C** (Example 4). However, the execution logic for these modes was incomplete or inaccurate:\n\n*   **Mode B (Examples 1, 2):** The width calculation logic (`W_out = min_c_first_row - 1` or `W_out = min_c + 5`) appears correct for determining the output dimensions. However, the content generation step (tentatively implemented as slicing and replacing 7s with 4s) failed to reproduce the expected output accurately. The actual transformation within the selected columns is more complex and context-dependent, involving modifications beyond simple replacement. The rules for this modification are not yet fully understood.\n*   **Mode C (Example 4):** The code correctly identified and removed the rows containing 7s. However, it completely missed the second part of the transformation observed in Example 4: the modification and extension (increasing the width) of the remaining rows. The rules governing how the grid is modified and which columns are appended are currently unknown.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Maintain Mode Logic:** Retain the established criteria for differentiating between Modes A, B, and C based on the configuration of 7s (all-7 rows, boundary row 7s, other 7s).\n2.  **Refine Mode A:** Keep the implementation as it correctly solves Example 3.\n3.  **Refine Mode B Description:** Update the description and facts to reflect that while the output width seems determined by the position of 7s in boundary rows, the content generation involves complex, context-specific modifications within those columns, not just simple 7-to-4 replacement. Acknowledge this part is not fully solved.\n4.  **Refine Mode C Description:** Update the description and facts to explicitly state that Mode C involves two steps: (1) Removing rows containing any 7s, and (2) Modifying and extending the width of the remaining grid according to rules that are currently undetermined. Acknowledge the extension/modification part is not implemented.\n5.  **Update Documentation:** Ensure the YAML facts and Natural Language Program accurately reflect these refined understandings and explicitly mention the unsolved aspects of Mode B content generation and Mode C modification/extension.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example | Mode Triggered | Input Size  | Code Output Size | Expected Output Size | Size Match | Pixels Off (if size match) | Correct | Key Reason for Discrepancy                                                                      |\n| :------ | :------------- | :---------- | :--------------- | :------------------- | :--------- | :------------------------- | :------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | B              | (7, 13)     | (7, 8)           | (7, 8)               | True       | 7                          | False   | Mode B content generation incorrect (simple 7->4 replace failed)                                |\n| 2       | B              | (7, 13)     | (7, 6)           | (7, 6)               | True       | 3                          | False   | Mode B content generation incorrect (simple 7->4 replace failed)                                |\n| 3       | A              | (9, 3)      | (6, 3)           | (6, 3)               | True       | 0                          | True    | Mode A logic (remove all-7 and sandwiched all-1 rows) correctly applied.                     |\n| 4       | C              | (7, 9)      | (5, 9)           | (5, 12)              | False      | N/A                        | False   | Mode C logic incomplete: only row removal was performed; modification/extension was missing. |\n\n## Facts\n\n```yaml\nelements:\n  - object: grid\n    properties:\n      - representation: 2D array of integers\n      - colors: [1, 4, 7] (7 is special)\n      - dimensions: height (H), width (W)\n  - object: color_7\n    properties:\n      - role: primary signal, instruction marker\n      - characteristic: transient (absent in output)\n      - location_properties:\n          - exists: boolean\n          - coords: list of (row, col) tuples\n          - rows_with_any_7: set of row indices\n          - rows_all_7: set of row indices containing only 7s\n          - is_in_first_row: boolean (row 0 has a 7)\n          - is_in_last_row: boolean (row H-1 has a 7)\n          - first_col_any_7 (min_c): min column index of any 7\n          - first_col_row_0 (min_c_first_row): min column index of 7 in row 0\n          - first_col_row_H-1 (min_c_last_row): min column index of 7 in last row\n\nactions:\n  - action: analyze_signal\n    actor: transformation process\n    input: input grid\n    output: color_7 location_properties\n  - action: determine_transformation_mode\n    actor: transformation process\n    input: color_7 location_properties\n    output: mode ('A', 'B', 'C', 'None')\n    logic:\n      - If not color_7.exists -> Mode 'None'\n      - Else if color_7.rows_all_7 is not empty -> Mode 'A'\n      - Else if color_7.is_in_first_row OR color_7.is_in_last_row -> Mode 'B'\n      - Else -> Mode 'C'\n  - action: execute_mode_A # Row removal (all-7, sandwiched-1)\n    actor: transformation process\n    input: input grid, signal properties (rows_all_7)\n    output: output grid\n    logic:\n      - Identify `R_all_7 = color_7.rows_all_7`.\n      - Identify `R_sandwiched_1` (rows of all 1s between rows in `R_all_7`).\n      - Remove rows in `R_all_7` union `R_sandwiched_1`.\n  - action: execute_mode_B # Boundary 7 -> Width adjustment + Complex modification\n    actor: transformation process\n    input: input grid, signal properties (min_c, min_c_first_row, min_c_last_row)\n    output: output grid\n    logic:\n      - Calculate output width `W_out`:\n          - If `min_c == min_c_last_row` (and exists): `W_out = min_c + 5`\n          - Else (first row 7 must exist): `W_out = min_c_first_row - 1`\n      - Create output grid of size (H, W_out).\n      - Populate content: Slice `input_grid[:, :W_out]`.

Determine if 7s exist. If they do, identify:\n    *   The set of all row indices containing at least one 7 (`rows_with_any_7`).\n    *   The set of row indices containing *only* 7s (`rows_all_7`).\n    *   Whether the first row (index 0) contains a 7 (`is_in_first_row`) and, if so, the minimum column index (`min_c_first_row`).\n    *   Whether the last row (index H-1) contains a 7 (`is_in_last_row`) and, if so, the minimum column index (`min_c_last_row`).\n    *   The overall minimum column index of any 7 (`min_c`).\n2.  **Determine Transformation Mode:**\n    *   **Mode None:** If no 7s are found in the grid.\n    *   **Mode A:** If the set `rows_all_7` is not empty.\n    *   **Mode B:** If Mode A is not met, AND (`is_in_first_row` is true OR `is_in_last_row` is true).\n    *   **Mode C:** If Modes A and B are not met, but 7s exist in the grid (`rows_with_any_7` is not empty).\n3.  **Execute Transformation based on Mode:**\n    *   **If Mode None:** Return the input grid unchanged.\n    *   **If Mode A:**\n        a. Identify the set `R_all_7` (rows containing only 7s).\n        b. Identify the set `R_sandwiched_1` (rows containing only 1s that are located vertically between any two rows from `R_all_7`).\n        c. Construct the output grid by taking all rows from the input grid whose indices are *not* in `R_all_7` and *not* in `R_sandwiched_1`, maintaining their original relative order.\n    *   **If Mode B:**\n        a. Calculate the target output width `W_out`:\n            i. If `min_c_last_row` exists and `min_c == min_c_last_row`: `W_out = min_c + 5`.\n            ii. Else (implies `min_c_first_row` must exist): `W_out = min_c_first_row - 1`.\n        b. Create an output grid structure with the same number of rows as the input and `W_out` columns.\n        c. **Populate Content (Complex):** Fill the output grid. The content is derived from the first `W_out` columns of the input grid but involves context-specific modifications that go beyond simple 7-to-4 replacement. *The precise rules for these modifications are not fully determined.*\n    *   **If Mode C:**\n        a. Identify the set `R_any_7` (all rows containing at least one 7).\n        b. Create an intermediate grid by taking all rows from the input grid whose indices are *not* in `R_any_7`, maintaining their original relative order.\n        c. **Modify and Extend (Complex):** Apply modifications to the content of this intermediate grid and extend its width by appending new columns to the right. *The rules for modification and the source/content of the appended columns are currently undetermined.*\n4.  **Return Output:** Return the resulting grid based on the executed mode."
