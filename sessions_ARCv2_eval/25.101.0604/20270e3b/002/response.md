## General Assessment

The previous code successfully implemented Mode A (Row Removal based on all-7 rows and sandwiched all-1 rows), correctly solving Example 3. However, it failed on Examples 1, 2, and 4, which fall into different transformation categories (tentatively Mode B and Mode C).

*   **Mode B (Examples 1, 2):** Triggered by 7s in the first or last row. The previous code used a simple column crop based on the first occurrence of 7 (`min_c`), which was incorrect for both width and content. The analysis suggests the output width might depend specifically on the first 7 in the *first* row or the first 7 in the *last* row, using different formulas (`W = min_c_first_row - 1` or `W = min_c_last_row + 5`). However, generating the *content* for this width is complex and involves more than simple cropping or replacing 7s with 4s. It appears context-dependent modifications occur within the selected columns.
*   **Mode C (Example 4):** Triggered by 7s present only in non-boundary rows, where those rows are *not* entirely composed of 7s. The previous code only removed rows containing 7s, failing to account for the observed width extension and content modification in the remaining rows. The transformation in this mode appears to involve:
    1.  Removing rows with 7s.
    2.  Modifying the content of the remaining rows.
    3.  Extending the width of the remaining rows. The source and logic for modification and extension are unclear.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Mode Identification:** Use the updated criteria based on whether rows consist *entirely* of 7s and whether 7s appear in boundary rows.
2.  **Maintain Mode A Logic:** The logic for removing all-7 rows and sandwiched all-1 rows works for Example 3 and should be kept.
3.  **Refine Mode B Logic:** Implement the hypothesized width calculation. For content, start with the assumption of taking the first `W_out` columns and replacing 7s with 4s, acknowledging this is likely incomplete and needs further refinement based on pattern analysis of the specific changes observed within those columns.
4.  **Refine Mode C Logic:** Implement the row removal step (removing rows with *any* 7s). Acknowledge that modification and extension are needed but the rules are not yet determined. For now, the output for this mode will be incomplete (only row removal).
5.  **Update Documentation:** Reflect the refined modes, actions, and known limitations in the YAML facts and natural language program.

## Metrics

**Example 1:**
*   Mode: B (7 in row 0)
*   Code Output Size: (7, 3)
*   Expected Output Size: (7, 8)
*   Code Correctness: Failed (Incorrect size and content)
*   Reason: Incorrect Mode B logic (simple crop at `min_c=3`). Needs correct width (`W=8`) and complex content generation.

**Example 2:**
*   Mode: B (7 in row 0 and row 6)
*   Code Output Size: (7, 1)
*   Expected Output Size: (7, 6)
*   Code Correctness: Failed (Incorrect size and content)
*   Reason: Incorrect Mode B logic (simple crop at `min_c=1`). Needs correct width (`W=6`) and complex content generation (though some rows match `grid[:,:6]`).

**Example 3:**
*   Mode: A (Rows 3 and 5 are all 7s)
*   Code Output Size: (6, 3)
*   Expected Output Size: (6, 3)
*   Code Correctness: Success
*   Reason: Mode A logic (remove all-7 rows and sandwiched all-1 rows) correctly applied.

**Example 4:**
*   Mode: C (7s present, not all-7 rows, not in boundary rows)
*   Code Output Size: (5, 9)
*   Expected Output Size: (5, 12)
*   Code Correctness: Failed (Incorrect size and content)
*   Reason: Mode C logic incomplete. Code only removed rows with 7s ({4, 5}), but did not perform necessary content modification and width extension.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Analyze Signal:** Examine the input grid to find all occurrences of the number 7. Determine the following properties:
    *   Does any row consist entirely of 7s?
    *   Are there any 7s in the first row (row 0)? If yes, find the minimum column index (`min_c_first_row`).
    *   Are there any 7s in the last row (row H-1)? If yes, find the minimum column index (`min_c_last_row`).
    *   Find the overall minimum column index (`min_c`) where any 7 appears.
2.  **Determine Transformation Mode:**
    *   **Mode A:** If any row consists entirely of 7s.
    *   **Mode B:** If Mode A is not met, AND (there is a 7 in the first row OR there is a 7 in the last row).
    *   **Mode C:** If Mode A and Mode B are not met, but 7s are present in the grid.
    *   **(Default):** If no 7s are present, return the input grid unchanged.
3.  **Execute Transformation based on Mode:**
    *   **If Mode A:**
        a. Identify the set of indices `R_all_7` for all rows containing only 7s.
        b. Identify the set of indices `R_sandwiched_1` for all rows that contain only 1s and are located vertically between any two rows whose indices are in `R_all_7`.
        c. Construct the output grid by selecting all rows from the input grid whose indices are *not* in `R_all_7` and *not* in `R_sandwiched_1`, maintaining their original relative order.
    *   **If Mode B:**
        a. Calculate the target output width `W_out`:
            i. If `min_c == min_c_last_row` (and `min_c_last_row` is finite): `W_out = min_c + 5`.
            ii. Otherwise: `W_out = min_c_first_row - 1`.
        b. Construct the output grid with the original number of rows and `W_out` columns.
        c. **(Content Generation - Complex/Uncertain):** Populate the output grid. The content seems derived from the first `W_out` columns of the input grid, but involves specific modifications and replacements (e.g., replacing 7s, potentially changing other numbers based on context) that are not fully captured by a simple rule like "replace all 7s with 4s". *Further analysis is needed to define the exact content generation rules.*
    *   **If Mode C:**
        a. Identify the set of indices `R_any_7` for all rows containing at least one 7.
        b. Create an intermediate grid by selecting all rows from the input grid whose indices are *not* in `R_any_7`, maintaining original relative order.
        c. **(Modification and Extension - Complex/Uncertain):** Modify the content of the intermediate grid and extend its width. The rules for modification and the source/content of the extended columns are currently unknown and require further analysis. *The current implementation might only perform step 3.c.a.*
4.  **Return Output:** Return the resulting grid.
