            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe previous attempt (Hypothesis V9 with a state machine) failed on all examples, indicating the logic was overly complex or fundamentally incorrect. The failures involved both incorrect modifications and missing required modifications.\n\nThe new analysis revisits the core idea: replacing the global maximum non-zero value (T) with the global minimum non-zero value (R) in columns, conditional on the position of the first R. By comparing columns where changes occurred versus where they were blocked or delayed, a refined set of conditions emerged:\n1.  A blocking condition based on the row index of the first R (relative to grid height).\n2.  A starting condition for replacement that usually begins at the first T below the first R, but has a special delay rule when the first R is at a specific early row index (index 1).\n\nThe strategy is to implement this simpler, more conditional rule (Hypothesis V13) and verify it against the examples.\n\n**Metrics and Observations from Examples:**\n\n*   **Global Values:**\n    *   Train 1: R=2, T=5, Rows=10\n    *   Train 2: R=2, T=3, Rows=10\n    *   Train 3: R=1, T=7, Rows=10\n*   **Blocking Threshold:** `rows / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5`. Blocking occurs if `first_r_row >= 5`.\n*   **Column Analysis (Focus on changes/blocks):**\n    *   **Train 1, Col 2:** `first_r_row = 6`. Blocked (6 >= 5). Expected: No change. **Hypothesis Correct.**\n    *   **Train 1, Col 4:** `first_r_row = 1`. Not blocked (1 < 5). `first_t_below_r = 2`. Special case `first_r_row == 1` applies. Start row = `2 + 2 = 4`. Replace T->R from row 4. Expected: Change rows 4-8. **Hypothesis Correct.**\n    *   **Train 1, Col 7:** `first_r_row = 3`. Not blocked (3 < 5). `first_t_below_r = 4`. Normal case. Start row = `4`. Replace T->R from row 4. Expected: Change rows 4-8. **Hypothesis Correct.**\n    *   **Train 2, Col 2:** `first_r_row = 6`. Blocked (6 >= 5). Expected: No change. **Hypothesis Correct.**\n    *   **Train 2, Col 6:** `first_r_row = 3`. Not blocked (3 < 5). `first_t_below_r = 4`. Normal case. Start row = `4`. Replace T->R from row 4. Expected: Change rows 4-8. **Hypothesis Correct.**\n    *   **Train 3, Col 2:** `first_r_row = 4`. Not blocked (4 < 5). `first_t_below_r = 5`. Normal case. Start row = `5`. Replace T->R from row 5. Expected: Change rows 5-8. **Hypothesis Correct.**\n    *   **Train 3, Col 5:** `first_r_row = 6`. Blocked (6 >= 5). Expected: No change. **Hypothesis Correct.**\n    *   **Train 3, Col 7:** `first_r_row = 7`. Blocked (7 >= 5). Expected: No change. **Hypothesis Correct.**\n\nThe hypothesis V13 appears consistent with all provided examples and their outputs.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_elements:\n  - element: Grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array\n      - content: non-negative integers (0-9)\n      - zero_meaning: background/empty\n      - dimensions: variable height and width\n  - element: Key Values\n    properties:\n      - role: Replacement Value (R)\n        identification: Smallest non-zero integer globally in the input grid.\n      - role: Target Value (T)\n        identification: Largest non-zero integer globally in the input grid.\n      - condition: Transformation only occurs if R and T exist and R != T.\n  - element: Transformation\n    properties:\n      - type: cell value modification (T -> R)\n      - scope: column-wise, conditional\n      - preserves_dimensions: true\n      - preserves_zeros: true\n  - element: Columnar Process\n    properties:\n      - scope: Operates independently on each column.\n      - dependency: Requires global R and T values first.\n      - grid_property_dependency: Uses number of rows (`rows`).\n  - element: Replacement Rule\n    properties:\n      - identification: Find the row index of the first occurrence of R in the column (`first_r_row`).\n      - blocking_condition: If `first_r_row` does not exist OR `first_r_row >= rows / 2` (integer division), no replacement occurs in this column.\n      - target_identification: If not blocked, find the row index of the first occurrence of T such that its index `first_t_below_r_row` is greater than `first_r_row`. If no such T exists, no replacement occurs.\n      - start_row_determination:\n          - If `first_r_row == 1` (the second row of the grid), `start_row = first_t_below_r_row + 2`.\n          - Otherwise, `start_row = first_t_below_r_row`.\n      - application: Iterate downwards from `start_row` to the last row of the column. If the cell value in the input grid equals T, change the corresponding cell in the output grid to R.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Global Key Values:** Scan the input grid to find the smallest non-zero integer (`R`) and the largest non-zero integer (`T`).\n2.  **Handle Edge Cases:** If `R` or `T` cannot be found, or if `R` equals `T`, return a copy of the input grid without changes.\n3.  **Initialize Output:** Create a copy of the input grid. Get the number of rows (`rows`).\n4.  **Process Each Column:** Iterate through the columns of the grid from left to right. For each column:\n    a.  **Find First R:** Find the row index of the first occurrence of `R`. If `R` is not found in this column, continue to the next column. Let the index be `first_r_row`.\n    b.  **Check Blocking Condition:** Calculate the blocking threshold `block_threshold = rows // 2`. If `first_r_row >= block_threshold`, continue to the next column (no changes in this column).\n    c.  **Find First T Below R:** Search downwards from row `first_r_row + 1`. Find the row index of the first occurrence of `T`. If no `T` is found below `first_r_row`, continue to the next column. Let this index be `first_t_below_r_row`.\n    d.  **Determine Replacement Start Row:**\n        i.  If `first_r_row` is exactly 1, set `start_row = first_t_below_r_row + 2`.\n        ii. Otherwise (if `first_r_row` is 0 or greater than 1), set `start_row = first_t_below_r_row`.\n    e.  **Apply Replacements:** Iterate through the rows from `start_row` down to the last row (`rows - 1`). For each row index `i` in this range, if the value in the *input* grid at `(i, current_column)` is equal to `T`, set the value in the *output* grid at `(i, current_column)` to `R`.\n5.  **Return Result:** After processing all columns, return the modified output grid."
