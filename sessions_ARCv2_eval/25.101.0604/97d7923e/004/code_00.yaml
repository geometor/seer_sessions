task_elements:
  - element: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - content: non-negative integers (0-9)
      - zero_meaning: background/empty
      - dimensions: variable height and width
  - element: Key Values
    properties:
      - role: Replacement Value (R)
        identification: Smallest non-zero integer globally in the input grid.
      - role: Target Value (T)
        identification: Largest non-zero integer globally in the input grid.
      - condition: Transformation only occurs if R and T exist and R != T.
  - element: Transformation
    properties:
      - type: cell value modification (T -> R)
      - scope: column-wise, conditional
      - preserves_dimensions: true
      - preserves_zeros: true
  - element: Columnar Process
    properties:
      - scope: Operates independently on each column.
      - dependency: Requires global R and T values first.
      - grid_property_dependency: Uses number of rows (`rows`).
  - element: Replacement Rule
    properties:
      - identification: Find the row index of the first occurrence of R in the column (`first_r_row`).
      - blocking_condition: If `first_r_row` does not exist OR `first_r_row >= rows / 2` (integer division), no replacement occurs in this column.
      - target_identification: If not blocked, find the row index of the first occurrence of T such that its index `first_t_below_r_row` is greater than `first_r_row`. If no such T exists, no replacement occurs.
      - start_row_determination:
          - If `first_r_row == 1` (the second row of the grid), `start_row = first_t_below_r_row + 2`.
          - Otherwise, `start_row = first_t_below_r_row`.
      - application: Iterate downwards from `start_row` to the last row of the column. If the cell value in the input grid equals T, change the corresponding cell in the output grid to R.
