task_elements:
  - element: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - content: non-negative integers
      - zero_meaning: background/empty
      - dimensions: variable
  - element: Transformation
    properties:
      - type: cell value modification
      - scope: column-wise, conditional
      - preserves_dimensions: true
      - preserves_zeros: true
  - element: Key Numbers
    properties:
      - role: Max Value (max_val)
        identification: The largest non-zero integer value present in the input grid.
        potential_role: Acts as the number to be potentially replaced (Target).
        examples: [5 (train_1), 3 (train_2), 7 (train_3)]
      - role: Min Value (min_val)
        identification: The smallest non-zero integer value present in the input grid.
        potential_role: Acts as the replacement number and triggers/modulates the replacement rule.
        examples: [2 (train_1), 2 (train_2), 1 (train_3)]
  - element: Columnar Process
    properties:
      - scope: Operates independently on each column.
      - identification_required: Must identify `min_val` and `max_val` globally first.
  - element: Replacement Rule (Revised Hypothesis)
    properties:
      - trigger_location: The row index of the *first* occurrence of `min_val` in the column (`first_min_row`).
      - target_cells: Occurrences of `max_val` at rows `i > first_min_row`.
      - replacement_value: `min_val`.
      - activation_condition: The replacement cascade for a column is only activated under specific (currently unclear) conditions related to the sequence of numbers in that column. Seems related to whether `max_val` appears immediately below `first_min_row` and potentially the presence/absence of other `min_val`s or values.
      - application_scope: If activated, the replacement might not apply to *all* `max_val` below `first_min_row` (e.g., train_1 col 4 shows a delayed start). The exact start row needs refinement. It might start at the row immediately after `first_min_row` OR potentially later. The process seems to replace contiguous blocks of `max_val`.
