task_elements:
  - element: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - content: non-negative integers
      - zero_meaning: likely background/empty
      - dimensions: variable
  - element: Transformation
    properties:
      - type: cell value modification
      - scope: column-wise
      - preserves_dimensions: true
      - preserves_zeros: true
  - element: Key Numbers
    properties:
      - role: Target Number (T)
        identification: The largest non-zero integer value present in the input grid.
        action_on: Gets replaced under specific conditions.
        examples: [5 (train_1), 3 (train_2), 7 (train_3)]
      - role: Replacement Number (R)
        identification: The smallest non-zero integer value present in the input grid.
        action_on: Triggers replacement and is the value used for replacement.
        examples: [2 (train_1), 2 (train_2), 1 (train_3)]
  - element: Condition for Change
    properties:
      - location: column-based
      - trigger: Presence of the Replacement Number (R) in a column.
      - rule: Any occurrence of the Target Number (T) in a cell *below* the topmost occurrence of the Replacement Number (R) within the same column is changed to the Replacement Number (R).
      - constraint: Cells above or at the same row as the topmost R, or cells in columns without R, are not changed based on this rule.
