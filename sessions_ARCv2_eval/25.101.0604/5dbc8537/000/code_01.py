# Overall Task Description:
# The task involves processing input grids to produce output grids.
# The transformation rules differ between examples but generally involve:
# 1. Identifying specific regions or segments within the input grid based on position or marker values.
# 2. Copying or modifying these segments/regions.
# 3. Applying color filling rules where the fill color is determined either by the row index or by patterns found in other parts of the input grid.

# Program for Train 1:
# For each row `r` from 0 to 14 in the input grid:
# 1. Find the column index of the first `9` (c1) and the last `9` (c2).
# 2. If `c1` and `c2` are found and `c2 - c1 + 1 == 7`:
#    a. Create a 7-element list for the output row, initialized with the values from `Input[r, c1]` to `Input[r, c2]`.
#    b. Determine the primary paint color `P` based on the row index `r`:
#       - P = 8 if r is 0 or 1.
#       - P = 3 if r is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
#       - P = 1 if r is 9 or 10.
#       - P = 5 if r is 11 or 15.
#       - P = 7 if r is 12, 13, or 14.
#    c. Fill the interior of the output row list (indices 1 through 5) with color `P`.
#    d. If the row index `r` is exactly 6, override the color at index 4 of the output row list, setting it to 0.
#    e. Add this completed 7-element list as the next row in the final output grid.

# Program for Train 2:
# 1. Create an empty 9x20 output grid.
# 2. For each row `r` from 0 to 8 (representing input rows `R = r + 11`):
# 3.   For each column `c` from 0 to 19:
# 4.     Get the value `V = Input[R, c]`.
# 5.     If `V` is 2:
# 6.       Set `Output[r, c] = 2`.
# 7.     Else (if `V` is 8):
# 8.       Extract the top portion of the column: `ColumnPattern = Input[0:11, c]`.
# 9.       Determine the replacement paint color `P` by applying a specific mapping rule to the `ColumnPattern`. This rule needs to be defined based on observed input-output pairs for column patterns:
#          - Example mapping: If `ColumnPattern` is all 8s, P = 4.
#          - Example mapping: If `ColumnPattern` contains a block of 6s like `[8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]`, P = 5.
#          - Example mapping: If `ColumnPattern` is `[8, 4, 7, 4, 7, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8]`, P = 0.
#          - Example mapping: If `ColumnPattern` is `[8, 7, 4, 7, 4, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8]`, P = 1.
#          - Example mapping: If `ColumnPattern` contains a block of 9s like `[8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8]`, P = 9.
#          - ... (other patterns map to 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 etc. based on examples)
# 10.      Set `Output[r, c] = P`.
# 11. Return the completed 9x20 output grid.
