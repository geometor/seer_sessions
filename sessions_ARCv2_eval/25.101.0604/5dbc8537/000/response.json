            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the examples provided.\n\n## Task Analysis\n\n**Train 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** 15x15 grid.\n*   **Output:** 15x7 grid.\n*   **Perception:** The output grid has the same height as the input but is narrower. Each output row seems derived from the corresponding input row. The number `9` appears to act as a boundary marker in the input rows. The transformation focuses on the segment between the first and last `9`. The interior of this segment in the output is filled with a color that changes based on the row index.\n*   **Key Observations:**\n    *   The output width is consistently 7.\n    *   In each input row used, the distance between the first and last `9` (inclusive) is exactly 7.\n    *   The values between the boundary `9`s in the input are mostly `4`s.\n    *   These internal values are replaced in the output by a \"paint\" color.\n    *   The paint color follows a pattern dependent on the row index: (Rows 0-1: 8), (Rows 2-8: 3, with row 6 having a special '0'), (Rows 9-10: 1), (Row 11: 5), (Rows 12-14: 7), (Row 15: 5).\n    *   Row 6 has a unique modification where one internal cell becomes `0` instead of the standard paint color for that block.\n\n**Train 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** 20x20 grid.\n*   **Output:** 9x20 grid.\n*   **Perception:** The output grid has the same width as the input but is shorter. The output corresponds to the bottom 9 rows of the input grid. The transformation seems to involve two background colors: `8` in the top part of the input and `2` in the bottom part. Cells with the bottom background color (`2`) are preserved, while other cells (`8` in the examples) are replaced with a color determined by the column's content in the top part of the input.\n*   **Key Observations:**\n    *   The output grid dimensions match the bottom 9 rows of the input (rows 11-19).\n    *   Cells with the value `2` in the input rows 11-19 remain `2` in the output.\n    *   Cells with the value `8` in the input rows 11-19 are replaced in the output.\n    *   The replacement color for an `8` at input position `(R, c)` (where R >= 11) depends *only* on the pattern of values in the column `c` within the top region of the input (rows 0-10).\n    *   The rule mapping the top column pattern to the replacement color is not immediately obvious (not simply first/last/most frequent non-background color). It appears to be a fixed mapping based on the specific pattern in the column above.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n```yaml\ntask_description: The overall task involves extracting or transforming specific regions of the input grid based on boundary markers or positional information, and applying color-filling rules determined either by row index or by patterns in other grid regions.\n\ntrain_1:\n  name: Segment Extraction and Row-Indexed Filling\n  input_dimensions: [15, 15]\n  output_dimensions: [15, 7]\n  observations:\n    - Each output row corresponds to an input row.\n    - Processing focuses on a horizontal segment in the input row.\n  objects:\n    - name: boundary_marker\n      value: 9\n      role: Defines the start and end of the relevant segment in each input row.\n    - name: segment\n      properties:\n        width: 7\n      location: Between the first and last boundary_marker (inclusive) in an input row.\n      role: Forms the basis of the output row.\n    - name: interior_cells\n      location: Cells within the segment, excluding the boundary_markers.\n      initial_value: Typically 4 in the input examples.\n      role: Target cells for color filling.\n    - name: paint_color\n      role: The color used to fill the interior_cells.\n      determination: Based on the row index `r`.\n        - r in {0, 1}: 8\n        - r in {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}: 3\n        - r == 6: 3 (with exception)\n        - r in {9, 10}: 1\n        - r == 11: 5\n        - r in {12, 13, 14}: 7\n        - r == 15: 5\n  actions:\n    - find: First (c1) and last (c2) column index of boundary_marker in input row `r`.\n    - validate: Check if `c2 - c1 + 1 == 7`.\n    - extract: Segment `Input[r, c1:c2+1]`.\n    - determine: paint_color `P` based on `r`.\n    - fill: Replace values in the extracted segment at relative indices 1 through 5 with `P`.\n    - modify (special case): If `r == 6`, set the value at relative index 4 within the segment to 0.\n  output_generation: Concatenate the processed segments row by row.\n\ntrain_2:\n  name: Bottom Region Projection with Column-Pattern Coloring\n  input_dimensions: [20, 20]\n  output_dimensions: [9, 20]\n  observations:\n    - The output grid corresponds spatially to the bottom 9 rows of the input grid.\n    - Two distinct regions with background colors exist in the input.\n  regions:\n    - name: top_region\n      rows: 0-10\n      background_color: 8\n    - name: bottom_region\n      rows: 11-19\n      background_color: 2\n  objects:\n    - name: target_cell\n      value: 8\n      location: Cells in the bottom_region that do not match the bottom_region background_color.\n      role: Cells to be replaced in the output.\n    - name: preserved_cell\n      value: 2\n      location: Cells in the bottom_region matching the background_color.\n      role: Cells copied directly to the output.\n    - name: column_pattern\n      location: `Input[0:11, c]` for a given column `c`.\n      role: Determines the replacement color for target_cells in that column.\n    - name: paint_color\n      role: The color used to replace target_cells.\n      determination: A fixed mapping (lookup or complex rule) from the column_pattern in the top_region to the paint_color.

Identifying specific regions or segments within the input grid based on position or marker values.\n# 2. Copying or modifying these segments/regions.\n# 3. Applying color filling rules where the fill color is determined either by the row index or by patterns found in other parts of the input grid.\n\n# Program for Train 1:\n# For each row `r` from 0 to 14 in the input grid:\n# 1. Find the column index of the first `9` (c1) and the last `9` (c2).\n# 2. If `c1` and `c2` are found and `c2 - c1 + 1 == 7`:\n#    a. Create a 7-element list for the output row, initialized with the values from `Input[r, c1]` to `Input[r, c2]`.\n#    b. Determine the primary paint color `P` based on the row index `r`:\n#       - P = 8 if r is 0 or 1.\n#       - P = 3 if r is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.\n#       - P = 1 if r is 9 or 10.\n#       - P = 5 if r is 11 or 15.\n#       - P = 7 if r is 12, 13, or 14.\n#    c. Fill the interior of the output row list (indices 1 through 5) with color `P`.\n#    d. If the row index `r` is exactly 6, override the color at index 4 of the output row list, setting it to 0.\n#    e. Add this completed 7-element list as the next row in the final output grid.\n\n# Program for Train 2:\n# 1. Create an empty 9x20 output grid.\n# 2. For each row `r` from 0 to 8 (representing input rows `R = r + 11`):\n# 3.   For each column `c` from 0 to 19:\n# 4.     Get the value `V = Input[R, c]`.\n# 5.     If `V` is 2:\n# 6.       Set `Output[r, c] = 2`.\n# 7.     Else (if `V` is 8):\n# 8.       Extract the top portion of the column: `ColumnPattern = Input[0:11, c]`.\n# 9.       Determine the replacement paint color `P` by applying a specific mapping rule to the `ColumnPattern`. This rule needs to be defined based on observed input-output pairs for column patterns:\n#          - Example mapping: If `ColumnPattern` is all 8s, P = 4.\n#          - Example mapping: If `ColumnPattern` contains a block of 6s like `[8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]`, P = 5.\n#          - Example mapping: If `ColumnPattern` is `[8, 4, 7, 4, 7, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8]`, P = 0.\n#          - Example mapping: If `ColumnPattern` is `[8, 7, 4, 7, 4, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8]`, P = 1.\n#          - Example mapping: If `ColumnPattern` contains a block of 9s like `[8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8]`, P = 9.\n#          - ... (other patterns map to 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 etc. based on examples)\n# 10.      Set `Output[r, c] = P`.\n# 11. Return the completed 9x20 output grid.\n\n```"
