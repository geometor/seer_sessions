"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules derived from train_1:

1. Iterate through each row of the input grid.
2. For each row, find the column indices of the first and last occurrence of the number 9.
3. If these boundary markers (9s) are found and the distance between them (inclusive) is exactly 7:
    a. Extract the segment of the row between the first and last 9 (inclusive).
    b. Determine a "paint" color based on the current row index (`r`):
        - Rows 0, 1: Paint color 8
        - Rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8: Paint color 3
        - Row 6: Paint color 3 (with a special modification later)
        - Rows 9, 10: Paint color 1
        - Row 11: Paint color 5
        - Rows 12, 13: Paint color 7
        - Row 14: Paint color 5 
    c. Create the output row by taking the extracted 7-element segment.
    d. Fill the interior of the output row (elements at indices 1 through 5) with the determined paint color.
    e. If the current row index is 6, specifically set the element at index 4 of the output row to 0.
4. Collect these processed 7-element rows to form the final output grid.
5. Assumes all input rows contain a valid segment of width 7 bounded by 9s.

Note: This implementation specifically models the transformation observed in the 'train_1' example. 
The logic from 'train_2' appears distinct and is not implemented here.
