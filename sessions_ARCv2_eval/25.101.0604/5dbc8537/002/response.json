            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code successfully identified the core mechanism of the first training example (extracting a 7-wide segment bounded by 9s) but made incorrect assumptions about the filling logic:\n1.  It filled the entire interior of the segment, whereas the correct behavior is to only replace cells matching a specific background color (identified as `4`) within the segment.\n2.  The mapping from row index to paint color was slightly incorrect, particularly for row 8.\n\nThe code completely failed on the second training example because the transformation logic is fundamentally different and wasn't implemented. `train_2` involves using the bottom part of the input grid as a template and filling certain cells based on information from the top part of the input grid.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Train 1 Logic:** Correct the code to only replace the background color `4` within the 7-wide segment with the row-dependent paint color, using the corrected row-to-color mapping. Preserve all other original values within the segment. Apply the special rule for row 6.\n2.  **Implement Train 2 Logic:** Introduce conditional logic or a separate function to handle the `train_2` pattern. This involves:\n    *   Identifying the input type (e.g., presence of 9-bounded segments vs. 20x20 grid with distinct top/bottom regions).\n    *   If type `train_2` is detected:\n        *   Select the bottom 9 rows of the input (`Input[11:20, :]`).\n        *   Iterate through the cells `(r, c)` of this subgrid (output rows 0-8).\n        *   If `Input[r+11, c]` is `2`, the output `Output[r, c]` is `2`.\n        *   If `Input[r+11, c]` is `8`, the output `Output[r, c]` is a color `P` determined by a currently complex or unclear rule involving the corresponding column in the top 11 rows (`Input[0:11, c]`) and potentially the row index `r`. Further analysis or examples would be needed to fully specify this rule, but the structural dependency is clear.\n3.  **Combine Logic:** Create a main function that detects the input type and calls the appropriate transformation logic.\n\n## Metrics\n\n**Train 1:**\n\n*   Input Dimensions: 15x15\n*   Output Dimensions: 15x7\n*   Segment Marker: 9\n*   Segment Width: 7\n*   Segment Background Color (to be replaced): 4\n*   Code `code_00.py` Result: Failed (Incorrect internal filling, incorrect paint color for row 8)\n*   Refined Logic Expected Result: Match\n\n**Train 2:**\n\n*   Input Dimensions: 20x20\n*   Output Dimensions: 9x20\n*   Input Top Region: Rows 0-10 (Background 8)\n*   Input Bottom Region: Rows 11-19 (Backgrounds 2 and 8)\n*   Output Base: Input Rows 11-19\n*   Output Rule 1: Copy value `2` from `Input[r+11, c]` to `Output[r, c]`.\n*   Output Rule 2: If `Input[r+11, c] == 8`, determine `Output[r, c]` based on `Input[0:11, :]` and potentially `r, c`.\n*   Code `code_00.py` Result: Failed (No output generated as no 9-bounded segments were found).\n*   Refined Logic Expected Result: Partial Match (if the complex rule for filling 8s is implemented as a placeholder or approximation), Full Match requires defining the exact rule.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n```yaml\ntask_description: The task involves two distinct grid transformation types based on input characteristics.

Check if any row in the input grid contains a segment of width 7 bounded by the value 9.\n# 2. If yes, return \"segment_fill\".\n# 3. Otherwise (e.g., if grid is 20x20 and lacks such segments), assume \"region_projection\". # Refine criteria if more types exist\n# 4. Return the detected type.\n\n# Function: Transform using Segment Fill (Type 1 - train_1 logic)\n# 1. Initialize an empty list for the output grid.\n# 2. Define the background color to be replaced: `fill_target = 4`.\n# 3. Define the row-to-paint-color mapping:\n#    - Rows 0, 1 -> 8\n#    - Rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 -> 3\n#    - Row 6 -> 3\n#    - Rows 8, 9 -> 1\n#    - Rows 10, 11, 14 -> 5\n#    - Rows 12, 13 -> 7\n# 4. For each row `r` from 0 to Input Height - 1:\n# 5.   Find the column index of the first `9` (c1) and the last `9` (c2).\n# 6.   If `c1` and `c2` are found and `c2 - c1 + 1 == 7`:\n# 7.     Extract the segment `S` from `Input[r, c1]` to `Input[r, c2]`.\n# 8.     Create a mutable copy `O` of the segment `S`.\n# 9.     Get the paint color `P` for row `r` from the mapping.\n# 10.    For each index `i` from 1 to 5 (representing the interior of the segment):\n# 11.      If the value `O[i]` is equal to `fill_target` (4):\n# 12.        Set `O[i] = P`.\n# 13.    If row index `r` is 6: # Apply special case for row 6\n# 14.      Set the value at index 4 of `O` (O[4]) to 0.\n# 15.    Append the modified segment `O` to the output grid list.\n# 16. Return the completed output grid.\n\n# Function: Transform using Region Projection (Type 2 - train_2 logic)\n# 1. Define output dimensions (e.g., 9x20 based on train_2).\n# 2. Create an output grid initialized with a default value (e.g., 0 or -1).\n# 3. Let `InputTop = Input[0:11, :]`\n# 4. For each output row `r` from 0 to 8:\n# 5.   For each output column `c` from 0 to 19:\n# 6.     Get the value `V_bottom = Input[r + 11, c]`.\n# 7.     If `V_bottom == 2`:\n# 8.       Set `Output[r, c] = 2`.\n# 9.     Else if `V_bottom == 8`:\n# 10.      Determine the fill color `P`. **This requires implementing the specific, complex rule `P = F(r, c, InputTop)` which maps the location (r, c) and the top region's content to the correct color P.** (This rule is not fully defined yet from the examples).\n# 11.      Set `Output[r, c] = P`.\n# 12.    Else: # Handle unexpected values in Input[r+11, c] if necessary\n# 13.      Set `Output[r, c]` to a default/error value.\n# 14. Return the completed output grid.\n\n# Main Execution Logic:\n# 1. Load the input grid.\n# 2. Detect the transformation type (`T`).\n# 3. If `T == \"segment_fill\"`:\n# 4.   Call `Transform using Segment Fill` function with the input grid.\n# 5. Else if `T == \"region_projection\"`:\n# 6.   Call `Transform using Region Projection` function with the input grid.\n# 7. Return the result.\n```"
