"""
Handles two types of grid transformations based on input grid properties.

Type 1 (Segment Fill - e.g., train_1):
- Identifies rows containing exactly one segment of width 7 bounded by the value 9.
- Extracts this 7-element segment.
- Replaces elements with the value 4 inside the segment (excluding the boundary 9s)
  with a "paint" color determined by the row index using a specific mapping.
- A special case applies to row index 6, where the element at relative index 4
  within the segment is set to 0, overriding any previous fill.

Type 2 (Region Projection - e.g., train_2):
- Assumes a 20x20 input grid.
- The output grid is 9x20, corresponding to the bottom 9 rows of the input (rows 11-19).
- Cells with value 2 in the input's bottom region are copied directly to the output.
- Cells with value 8 in the input's bottom region are replaced in the output
  with a color determined solely by the column index 'c'. This color mapping is
  derived directly by observing the column-wise relationship between the input's
  top region and the output colors in the train_2 example.
