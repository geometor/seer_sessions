Data:
  - Input: Grid (Matrix of integers)
  - Output: Grid (Matrix of integers)

Elements:
  - Type: Number / Color
    Values:
      - 0: Background/Empty
      - 1: Separator (Row or Column)
      - Others (2-9): Foreground Colors/Objects
  - Type: Pattern Color (PC)
    Derivation: The color (excluding 0, 1) whose non-zero instances have the globally minimum bounding box area. Tie-break using the smallest color value.
  - Type: Output Colors (C1, C2)
    Derivation: The two most frequent colors (excluding 0, 1, PC).
    Properties:
      - C1: Higher frequency (tie-break with smaller color value).
      - C2: Lower frequency (tie-break with smaller color value among remaining).
  - Type: PatternMask
    Derivation: Binary grid based on the location of PC within its minimal bounding box (1 for PC, 0 otherwise).
    Properties:
      - Height: Ph
      - Width: Pw
  - Type: Motif
    Derivation: A grid of size Ph x Pw, filled with C1 and C2 based on the PatternMask. The specific mapping rule (e.g., 1->C1/0->C2 vs. 1->C2/0->C1 or more complex) appears context-dependent (possibly on PC value or other factors).
    Properties:
      - Height: Ph
      - Width: Pw
      - Colors: C1, C2

Properties:
  - Frequency: Count of occurrences of each color (excluding 0, 1).
  - BoundingBox: Minimal rectangle enclosing non-zero elements of a specific color.
    Attributes: Height (h), Width (w), Area (a=h*w).
  - Output Dimensions:
    - Height (Ho): Ph (unless special case).
    - Width (Wo): Determined by a currently unknown rule, possibly involving Pw, PC, C1/C2 properties, or grid structure.
  - Input Style:
    - Default: Separators (if any) are single columns or absent.
    - Train_1 Style: Multiple full rows of separators (1s) exist.

Relationships & Actions:
  - Identify PC: Find color C != 0, 1 with minimum BBox Area(C).
  - Extract PatternMask: Get Ph x Pw binary mask from PC's BBox.
  - Identify C1, C2: Find two most frequent colors C' != 0, 1, PC.
  - Generate Motif: Create Ph x Pw grid using C1, C2, and PatternMask (rule TBD).
  - Determine Output Dimensions Ho, Wo:
      - If Train_1 Style: Ho = 2*Ph + 1, Wo = Pw.
      - Else: Ho = Ph, Wo = Apply specific rule (TBD).
  - Construct Output:
      - If Train_1 Style: Vertically stack Motif rows with a C2 row: `vstack(Motif[0], Motif[1], [C2]*Wo, Motif[0], Motif[1])`.
      - Else: Tile/arrange the Motif horizontally to fill Ho x Wo (exact mechanism needs clarification, especially for complex cases like train_2). Simple tiling: `np.tile(Motif, (1, floor(Wo/Pw)))` + `Motif[:, :Wo%Pw]`.
