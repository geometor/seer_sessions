The number `1` appears to function as a separator, either forming complete rows (like in `train_1`) or columns (like in `train_2`, `train_3`, `train_4`). These separators divide the input grid into distinct regions. The number `0` seems to act as a background or empty space within regions. Other numbers (`2`, `3`, `4`, `6`, `8`, `9`) represent foreground elements or colors within these regions.\n2.  **Output Structure**: The output is also a grid of integers, generally smaller than the input. The output grid seems composed of only two distinct integer values in each example.\n3.  **Core Logic**: The transformation appears to involve several steps:\n    *   **Color Selection**: Identifying two primary colors (let's call them C1 and C2) from the input grid that will constitute the output. These seem to be the two most frequent colors in the input, excluding the background (`0`) and separator (`1`).\n    *   **Pattern Identification**: Identifying a specific region in the input grid that defines a spatial pattern. This \"pattern region\" seems associated with a third color (let's call it PC), which is determined based on properties like frequency (least frequent?) or the spatial extent of its non-zero elements (smallest bounding box?). Color `4` often seems involved in the pattern, either as the pattern color itself or being filtered out.\n    *   **Pattern Extraction**: Extracting the spatial arrangement of the non-zero PC elements within its minimal bounding box. This creates a binary `PatternMask`.\n    *   **Motif Generation**: Creating a small grid (`Motif`) based on the `PatternMask` dimensions, where cells corresponding to `1` in the mask are filled with C1, and cells corresponding to `0` are filled with C2.\n    *   **Output Generation**: The final output grid appears to be generated by tiling, repeating, or potentially scaling the `Motif`. The exact mechanism for determining the final output dimensions and how the `Motif` is used to fill these dimensions (e.g., simple tiling, tiling with cropping) is the most complex part and not immediately obvious across all examples, although horizontal tiling seems prominent in some cases (like `train_3`). The height of the output often matches the height of the `PatternMask`.\n\n## Facts\n\n```yaml\nData:\n  - Input: Grid (Matrix of integers)\n  - Output: Grid (Matrix of integers)\n\nElements:\n  - Type: Number / Color\n    Values:\n      - 0: Background/Empty\n      - 1: Separator (Row or Column)\n      - 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9: Foreground Colors/Objects\n  - Type: Region\n    Description: Sub-grid area defined by separators (1s) or contiguous blocks of a single color.\n  - Type: PatternMask\n    Description: A binary grid derived from the spatial arrangement of a specific Pattern Color (PC) within its region. Represents the shape template.\n    Properties:\n      - Height: Ph\n      - Width: Pw\n  - Type: Motif\n    Description: A small grid generated by filling the PatternMask shape with the two primary output colors (C1, C2).\n    Properties:\n      - Height: Ph\n      - Width: Pw\n      - Colors: C1, C2\n\nProperties:\n  - Frequency: Count of occurrences of each color (excluding 0, 1).\n  - BoundingBox: Minimal rectangle enclosing non-zero elements of a specific color within a region.\n  - Area: Size of the BoundingBox.\n\nRelationships & Actions:\n  - Separation: The input grid is parsed into Regions based on Separator (1) lines.\n  - Color Selection (Output Colors):\n    - Identify all colors C != 0, 1.\n    - Calculate frequency of each C.\n    - Select C1 = most frequent color.\n    - Select C2 = second most frequent color.\n  - Color Selection (Pattern Color):\n    - Identify remaining colors R = {C | C != 0, 1, C1, C2}.\n    - Select PC from R based on a criterion (e.g., least frequent, or color whose non-zero elements form the smallest bounding box area).\n  - Pattern Extraction:\n    - Locate the Region containing PC.\n    - Find the minimal BoundingBox around non-zero PC values in that region.\n    - Create PatternMask (binary) based on the relative positions of PC values within the BoundingBox.\n  - Motif Generation:\n    - Create a Motif grid with the same dimensions as PatternMask.\n    - Fill Motif cells with C1 where PatternMask is 1.\n    - Fill Motif cells with C2 where PatternMask is 0.\n  - Output Construction:\n    - Determine output dimensions (Ho, Wo). Ho often equals PatternMask height (Ph). Wo seems derived from PatternMask width (Pw) and potentially the Pattern Color (PC) or other properties, possibly involving tiling or repetition.\n    - Fill the output grid by using the Motif as a repeating tile (primarily horizontally), potentially cropping the last tile to match Wo.\n\nExamples:\n  - train_3: C1=6, C2=4. PC=3. PatternMask (4x5) from color 3. Motif generated. Output size 4x15. Output is Motif tiled horizontally 3 times (N=3, which equals PC).\n  - Other examples suggest a more complex relationship between Motif and Output size/tiling.\n```\n\n## Natural Language Program\n\n1.  Parse the input grid. Identify separator lines (rows or columns of `1`s) to conceptually divide the grid into distinct regions.\n2.  Count the frequency of each non-zero, non-one integer (color) across the entire input grid.\n3.  Identify the color with the highest frequency as `C1`.\n4.  Identify the color with the second-highest frequency as `C2`.\n5.  Identify the set of remaining colors `R` (present in the input, but not `0`, `1`, `C1`, or `C2`).\n6.  Determine the Pattern Color `PC` by selecting the color from `R` whose non-zero instances within its primary region form the minimal bounding box with the smallest area.\n7.  Locate the region dominated by color `PC`. Find the minimal bounding box containing all `PC` values within this region.\n8.  Create a binary `PatternMask` grid representing the relative positions of `PC` values within this bounding box (1 for `PC`, 0 for others). Let the dimensions of this mask be `Ph` x `Pw`.\n9.  Create a `Motif` grid of size `Ph` x `Pw`. Fill the cells corresponding to `1`s in the `PatternMask` with `C1` and cells corresponding to `0`s with `C2`.\n10. Determine the dimensions of the output grid, `Ho` x `Wo`. The height `Ho` is typically equal to `Ph`. The width `Wo` appears determined by a rule involving `Pw` and potentially `PC` or region dimensions (the exact rule needs clarification, but `Wo` is often a multiple or near-multiple of `Pw`).\n11. Construct the final output grid of size `Ho` x `Wo` by tiling the `Motif` horizontally. The number of full tiles is `floor(Wo / Pw)`. Append the first `Wo % Pw` columns of the `Motif` to complete the width `Wo`. (Note: The exact mechanism determining `Wo` and handling edge cases like in `train_1` height needs refinement)."
