Data:
  - Input: Grid (Matrix of integers)
  - Output: Grid (Matrix of integers)

Elements:
  - Type: Number / Color
    Values:
      - 0: Background/Empty
      - 1: Separator (Row or Column)
      - Others (2-9): Foreground Colors/Objects
  - Type: Pattern Color (PC)
    Derivation: The color (excluding 0, 1) whose non-zero instances have the globally minimum bounding box area. Tie-break using the smallest color value.
  - Type: Output Colors (C1, C2)
    Derivation: The two most frequent colors (excluding 0, 1, PC).
    Properties:
      - C1: Higher frequency (tie-break with smaller color value).
      - C2: Lower frequency (tie-break with smaller color value among remaining).
  - Type: PatternMask
    Derivation: Binary grid based on the location of PC within its minimal bounding box (1 for PC, 0 otherwise).
    Properties:
      - Height: Ph
      - Width: Pw
  - Type: Motif
    Derivation: A grid of size Ph x Pw, filled based on the PatternMask: cells are C1 where PatternMask is 1, and C2 where PatternMask is 0.
    Properties:
      - Height: Ph
      - Width: Pw
      - Colors: C1, C2

Properties:
  - Frequency: Count of occurrences of each color (excluding 0, 1).
  - BoundingBox: Minimal rectangle enclosing non-zero elements of a specific color.
    Attributes: Height (h), Width (w), Area (a=h*w).
  - Input Style:
    - Train_1 Style: Multiple full rows of separators (1s) exist.
    - Default Style: Separators (if any) are single columns or absent.

Relationships & Actions:
  - Identify PC: Find color C != 0, 1 with minimum BBox Area(C).
  - Extract PatternMask: Get Ph x Pw binary mask from PC's BBox.
  - Identify C1, C2: Find two most frequent colors C' != 0, 1, PC.
  - Generate Motif: Create Ph x Pw grid mapping PatternMask 1 to C1, 0 to C2.
  - Determine Output Dimensions (Ho, Wo) and Tiling Rule:
    - If Train_1 Style:
        - Ho = 2*Ph + 1
        - Wo = Pw
        - Tiling: Special Vertical Stacking.
    - Else (Default Style):
        - Ho = Ph
        - If PC == 3 and Pw == 5: # Rule A (Ex3)
            - Wo = Pw * PC
            - Tiling: Simple Horizontal (Motif repeated PC times).
        - Else: # Rule B (Ex2, Ex4, and potentially others)
            - Wo = Pw * max(1, PC - 1) + max(0, PC - 2) # Accounts for PC=2 case (Wo=Pw)
            - Tiling: Complex Horizontal (Motif repeated PC-1 times, interspersed with PC-2 columns of C2).
  - Construct Output: Apply the determined Tiling rule using the generated Motif to fill the Ho x Wo grid.
