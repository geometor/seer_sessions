## General Assessment

The previous code (`code_00.py`) successfully identified shapes and implemented the conditional fill color logic (e.g., 8->1, 2->7, 4 based on min_obd). However, it failed on examples 1 and 2 because its method for identifying which zeros to fill (`_find_all_interior_zeros` based on boundary reachability) did not match the pattern shown in the expected outputs for those examples.

Specifically:
*   **Example 1:** The code failed to fill the zeros `(1,2)` and `(1,4)` within the '4' shape with the color '6'. The expected output requires this fill.
*   **Example 2:** The code failed to fill the zeros `(6,8)` and `(8,8)` near the '4' shape with the color '5'. The expected output requires this fill. The previous "boundary reachability" definition correctly excluded these zeros, indicating that definition was flawed for this task.

The analysis reveals that the transformation doesn't fill all globally "interior" zeros, but rather fills connected components of zeros that act as "holes" within a single shape instance. A "hole" is identified as a connected component of zeros where all of its non-zero *orthogonal* neighbors belong to the *same* shape instance.

**Strategy:**

1.  Identify all non-zero shapes (8-way connectivity).
2.  Identify all connected components of zeros (4-way/orthogonal connectivity).
3.  For each zero component, examine its interface with non-zero cells: Find all non-zero orthogonal neighbors for all cells within the zero component.
4.  If all these non-zero neighbors belong to exactly one shape instance, then this zero component is a "hole" associated with that shape.
5.  Determine the fill color using the established logic based on the enclosing shape's color (`C`) and the minimum other border color (`min_obd`) if `C=4`.
6.  Fill all cells belonging to the identified "hole" component with the determined fill color.

## Metrics

Based on the revised "hole" definition and the expected outputs:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input Shapes:** Color 4 (U-shape), Color 3 (complex), Color 7 (C-shape).
    *   **Zero Components & Holes:**
        *   Component `{(1,2)}`: Orthogonal non-zero neighbors are all from Shape 4. **Is a hole.**
        *   Component `{(1,4)}`: Orthogonal non-zero neighbors are all from Shape 4. **Is a hole.**
        *   Component `{(5,1), (5,2), ... (9,4)}`: Orthogonal non-zero neighbors are all from Shape 3. **Is a hole.**
        *   Component `{(7,8), (8,8), ... (9,10)}`: Orthogonal non-zero neighbors are all from Shape 7. **Is a hole.**
        *   Other large zero components connected to the boundary exist but are not holes.
    *   **Fill Logic:**
        *   Shape 4 holes: C=4, Others={3, 7}, min_obd=3. Fill=6.
        *   Shape 3 hole: C=3. Fill=3.
        *   Shape 7 hole: C=7. Fill=7.
    *   **Expected Output:** Fills (1,2) and (1,4) with 6; fills 3-block with 3; fills 7-block with 7. **Matches expected.**
    *   **Code_00 Result:** Failed (missed filling the '4' holes). Score: 8.33.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input Shapes:** Color 8 (rectangle), Color 5 (U-shape), Color 4 (hollow diamond).
    *   **Zero Components & Holes:**
        *   Component `{(1,5), (1,6), (2,5), (2,6)}`: Orthogonal non-zero neighbors are all from Shape 8. **Is a hole.**
        *   Component `{(6,8)}`: Orthogonal non-zero neighbors `{(6,9), (7,8)}` are all from Shape 4. **Is a hole.**
        *   Component `{(8,8)}`: Orthogonal non-zero neighbors `{(7,8), (8,9)}` are all from Shape 4. **Is a hole.**
        *   Other zero components (e.g., containing `(1,2)`, `(6,7)`) have non-zero neighbors from multiple shapes or the boundary.
    *   **Fill Logic:**
        *   Shape 8 hole: C=8. Fill=1.
        *   Shape 4 holes `{(6,8), (8,8)}`: C=4, Others={8, 5}, min_obd=5. Fill=5.
    *   **Expected Output:** Fills 8-block with 1; Fills (6,8) and (8,8) with 5. **Matches expected.**
    *   **Code_00 Result:** Failed (missed filling the '4' holes). Score: 4.0.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Input Shapes:** Color 4 (rectangle), Color 2 (L-shape).
    *   **Zero Components & Holes:**
        *   Component `{(1,11)}`: Orthogonal non-zero neighbors `{(1,10), (2,11)}` are all from Shape 2. **Is a hole.**
        *   Component `{(2,12)}`: Orthogonal non-zero neighbors `{(1,12), (2,11), (3,12)}` are all from Shape 2. **Is a hole.**
        *   Other zero components exist but are not holes.
    *   **Fill Logic:**
        *   Shape 2 holes: C=2. Fill=7.
        *   Shape 4: No holes identified for it. Fill logic for C=4 (min_obd=2) would result in None anyway.
    *   **Expected Output:** Fills (1,11) and (2,12) with 7. **Matches expected.**
    *   **Code_00 Result:** Passed. Score: 0.0. (The boundary-reachability method happened to identify the correct zeros in this specific case).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty list `all_shapes` and an empty dictionary `cell_to_shape_map`.
2.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct connected components of identical non-zero digits using 8-way adjacency (orthogonal and diagonal). For each component found:
    a.  Record its color (`C`) and the set of cell coordinates (`cells`).
    b.  Create a unique shape object containing `C`, `cells`, and a unique ID. Add this object to `all_shapes`.
    c.  For each cell `(r, c)` in `cells`, add an entry to `cell_to_shape_map` mapping `(r, c)` to the shape object.
3.  Find all distinct connected components of 0-valued cells using 4-way (orthogonal) adjacency. Store each component as a set of cell coordinates. Let this list be `zero_components`.
4.  Create the `output_grid` as a deep copy of the `input_grid`.
5.  For each `component` (a set of zero cell coordinates) in `zero_components`:
    a.  Find the set of all non-zero *orthogonal* neighbors for all cells within the `component`. Let this set be `neighbor_cells`.
    b.  If `neighbor_cells` is empty, continue to the next `component`.
    c.  Determine the set of unique shape objects these neighbors belong to by looking up each cell in `neighbor_cells` using `cell_to_shape_map`. Let this set be `neighbor_shapes`.
    d.  Check if `neighbor_shapes` contains exactly one unique shape object. If it does, this `component` is a "hole", and let the single shape object in `neighbor_shapes` be `enclosing_shape`.
    e.  If the `component` is a hole (exactly one `enclosing_shape` was found):
        i.  Determine the fill color `F` based on the `enclosing_shape` and the list `all_shapes`:
            1.  Let `C` be the color of `enclosing_shape`.
            2.  If `C` is 3, set `F` to 3.
            3.  Else if `C` is 7, set `F` to 7.
            4.  Else if `C` is 8, set `F` to 1.
            5.  Else if `C` is 2, set `F` to 7.
            6.  Else if `C` is 4:
                *   Create a set of border colors from all shapes in `all_shapes` *except* for the `enclosing_shape` (compare using shape IDs or objects).
                *   If this set is empty, set `F` to `None`.
                *   Otherwise, find the minimum value (`min_obd`) in the set.
                *   If `min_obd` is 5, set `F` to 5.
                *   Else if `min_obd` is 3, set `F` to 6.
                *   Otherwise, set `F` to `None`.
            7.  Else (for C=5 or any other color), set `F` to `None`.
        ii. If a fill color `F` was determined (i.e., `F` is not `None`), iterate through all cell coordinates `(rz, cz)` in the current `component` and set `output_grid[rz][cz]` to `F`.
6.  Return the `output_grid`.
