            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of digits (0-9).\n2.  **Objects:** The primary objects are contiguous regions (connected components) of identical non-zero digits. Let's call these \"shapes\". The digit forming the shape boundary is the \"border color\". The digit `0` typically represents the background or empty space.\n3.  **Action:** The core action is filling certain areas of `0`s within the grid with a specific non-zero digit.\n4.  **Target Areas:** The `0`s being filled are those located in the \"interior\" of a shape. A `0` is considered interior if it's completely surrounded by the shape's border color, meaning a path of `0`s starting from that cell cannot reach the edge of the grid without passing through the border color. Shapes that are \"open\" (their interior `0`s can reach the grid edge via other `0`s) are not filled (e.g., the '5' shape in train_2).\n5.  **Fill Color Determination:** The color used to fill the interior depends primarily on the border color (`C`) of the shape being filled.\n    *   For some border colors (3 and 7), the fill color is the same as the border color.\n    *   For other border colors (2 and 8), there seems to be a fixed mapping to a different fill color (2->7, 8->1).\n    *   For border color 4, the fill color depends on the *other* shapes present in the grid. Specifically, it seems related to the minimum border color among the other shapes.\n    *   For border color 5, no filling occurred (though the example shape was also open).\n6.  **No Change:** Cells that are not interior `0`s of a shape remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nelements:\n  - element: grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9)\n      - size: variable (rows x columns)\n  - element: cell\n    properties:\n      - value: integer (0-9)\n      - position: (row, column)\n  - element: shape\n    properties:\n      - type: connected component of identical non-zero cells\n      - border_color: integer (C > 0)\n      - cells: list of cell positions\n      - interior_zeros: list of cell positions (value 0) fully enclosed by the shape's border_color cells (cannot reach grid boundary via 0-valued cells)\n  - element: fill_color\n    properties:\n      - value: integer (F > 0)\nrelationships:\n  - type: spatial\n    description: Cells are adjacent (orthogonally and diagonally).

Iterate through the input grid to identify all distinct connected components (\"shapes\") formed by identical non-zero digits. Record the border color (`C`) and the cell coordinates for each shape.\n2.  For each identified shape:\n    a.  Determine the set of interior `0` cells. An interior `0` cell is one from which a path consisting only of `0` cells cannot reach any cell on the boundary of the grid. This can be found using a flood-fill algorithm starting from `0` cells adjacent to the shape's border cells, marking all reachable `0`s that do not hit the boundary. Alternatively, flood-fill from all boundary `0`s and mark reachable `0`s; any remaining unmarked `0`s are interior.\n    b.  If the shape has no interior `0` cells, proceed to the next shape.\n    c.  Determine the fill color (`F`) based on the shape's border color (`C`):\n        i.  If `C` is 3, set `F` to 3.\n        ii. If `C` is 7, set `F` to 7.\n        iii.If `C` is 8, set `F` to 1.\n        iv. If `C` is 2, set `F` to 7.\n        v.  If `C` is 4:\n            1.  Find all *other* shapes in the grid.\n            2.  Collect their border colors into a set.\n            3.  If the set of other border colors is empty, do not assign a fill color (`F` remains undetermined).\n            4.  Otherwise, find the minimum value (`min_obd`) in the set of other border colors.\n            5.  If `min_obd` is 5, set `F` to 5.\n            6.  Else if `min_obd` is 3, set `F` to 6.\n            7.  Otherwise (if `min_obd` is not 5 or 3), do not assign a fill color (`F` remains undetermined).\n        vi. If `C` is 5 (or any other digit not specified above), do not assign a fill color (`F` remains undetermined).\n    d.  If a fill color `F` was determined in the previous step, change the value of all identified interior `0` cells for the current shape to `F` in the output grid.\n3.  Return the modified grid."
