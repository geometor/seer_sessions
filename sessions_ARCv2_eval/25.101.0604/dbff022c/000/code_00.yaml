elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - size: variable (rows x columns)
  - element: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
  - element: shape
    properties:
      - type: connected component of identical non-zero cells
      - border_color: integer (C > 0)
      - cells: list of cell positions
      - interior_zeros: list of cell positions (value 0) fully enclosed by the shape's border_color cells (cannot reach grid boundary via 0-valued cells)
  - element: fill_color
    properties:
      - value: integer (F > 0)
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Cells are adjacent (orthogonally and diagonally). Shapes occupy specific regions of the grid. Interior zeros are enclosed by a shape.
actions:
  - action: identify_shapes
    input: grid
    output: list of shapes (with border_color, cells)
  - action: find_interior_zeros
    input: shape, grid
    output: list of interior_zero positions for that shape
  - action: determine_fill_color
    input: shape (border_color C), all_shapes
    output: fill_color F or None
    logic:
      - Based on C:
        - C=3 -> F=3
        - C=7 -> F=7
        - C=8 -> F=1
        - C=2 -> F=7
        - C=4 -> depends on minimum border_color (min_obd) of *other* shapes:
          - if min_obd = 5 -> F=5
          - if min_obd = 3 -> F=6
          - otherwise -> F=None (no fill)
        - C=5 -> F=None (no fill)
        - Other C -> Undefined by examples (assume F=None or F=C)
  - action: fill_grid
    input: grid, shape, interior_zeros, fill_color F
    output: modified grid
    condition: F is not None and interior_zeros is not empty
    effect: Changes the value of interior_zero cells to F
