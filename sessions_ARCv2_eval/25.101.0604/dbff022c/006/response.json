            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code execution failed due to a technical error (`unhashable type: 'dict'`) related to using dictionary objects directly within a set. The underlying logic\u2014identifying shapes, finding zero components, checking if a zero component is a \"hole\" enclosed by a single shape instance, and applying fill color rules based on the enclosing shape and context\u2014appears sound based on the analysis of expected outputs.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the implementation error by assigning unique, hashable identifiers (e.g., integers) to each distinct shape instance. The `cell_to_shape_map` will store these IDs, and the process of identifying holes will involve collecting neighbor shape IDs. Once a hole associated with a unique shape ID is found, the corresponding shape object can be retrieved to determine the fill color. This refined approach should correctly implement the previously developed transformation logic.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe previous code failed during execution for all examples due to the `unhashable type: 'dict'` error. Therefore, no output was generated, and metrics like Pixels Off, Match Status, etc., are not applicable. The conceptual analysis from the previous step, based on the \"hole\" definition, correctly predicted the expected outputs for all three examples. The current goal is to implement this logic correctly.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n```yaml\nelements:\n  - element: grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9)\n      - size: variable (rows x columns)\n  - element: cell\n    properties:\n      - value: integer (0-9)\n      - position: (row, column)\n  - element: shape\n    properties:\n      - type: connected component (8-way adjacency) of identical non-zero cells\n      - border_color: integer (C > 0)\n      - cells: set of cell positions {(r, c), ...}\n      - id: unique, hashable identifier (e.g., integer) for each shape instance\n  - element: zero_component\n    properties:\n      - type: connected component (4-way/orthogonal adjacency) of 0-valued cells\n      - cells: set of cell positions {(r, c), ...}\n  - element: hole\n    properties:\n      - type: zero_component\n      - characteristic: All non-zero orthogonal neighbors of the component's cells belong to the same, single shape instance (identified by shape.id).\n      - enclosing_shape_id: The unique ID of the shape instance identified by the neighbors.\n  - element: fill_color\n    properties:\n      - value: integer (F > 0) or None\n\nrelationships:\n  - type: spatial\n    description: Cells have orthogonal and diagonal neighbors.

Assign a counter `next_shape_id` starting from 0.\n2.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct connected components of identical non-zero digits using 8-way adjacency. For each component found:\n    a.  Record its color (`C`) and the set of cell coordinates (`cells`).\n    b.  Create a shape object containing `C`, `cells`, and the current value of `next_shape_id` as its unique ID. Add this object to `all_shapes`.\n    c.  For each cell `(r, c)` in `cells`, add an entry to `cell_to_shape_id_map` mapping `(r, c)` to `next_shape_id`.\n    d.  Increment `next_shape_id`.\n3.  Find all distinct connected components of 0-valued cells using 4-way (orthogonal) adjacency. Store each component as a set of cell coordinates. Let this list be `zero_components`.\n4.  Create the `output_grid` as a deep copy of the `input_grid`.\n5.  Create a lookup map `shape_lookup` from shape ID to the corresponding shape object in `all_shapes`.\n6.  For each `component_cells` (a set of zero cell coordinates) identified in step 3:\n    a.  Find the set of all non-zero *orthogonal* neighbors for all cells within `component_cells`.\n    b.  If there are no non-zero neighbors, continue to the next component.\n    c.  Collect the unique shape IDs corresponding to these non-zero neighbors using the `cell_to_shape_id_map`. Let this set be `neighbor_shape_ids`.\n    d.  Check if `neighbor_shape_ids` contains exactly one unique ID. If it does, this `component_cells` represents a \"hole\". Let the single ID be `enclosing_shape_id`.\n    e.  If it is a hole:\n        i.  Retrieve the `enclosing_shape` object from `shape_lookup` using `enclosing_shape_id`.\n        ii. Determine the fill color `F` based on the `enclosing_shape` and the list `all_shapes`:\n            1.  Let `C` be the color of `enclosing_shape`.\n            2.  If `C` is 3, set `F` to 3.\n            3.  Else if `C` is 7, set `F` to 7.\n            4.  Else if `C` is 8, set `F` to 1.\n            5.  Else if `C` is 2, set `F` to 7.\n            6.  Else if `C` is 4:\n                *   Create a set of border colors from all shapes in `all_shapes` whose ID is *not* equal to `enclosing_shape_id`.\n                *   If this set is empty, set `F` to `None`.\n                *   Otherwise, find the minimum value (`min_obd`) in the set.\n                *   If `min_obd` is 5, set `F` to 5.\n                *   Else if `min_obd` is 3, set `F` to 6.\n                *   Otherwise, set `F` to `None`.\n            7.  Else (for C=5 or any other color), set `F` to `None`.\n        iii. If a fill color `F` was determined (i.e., `F` is not `None`), iterate through all cell coordinates `(rz, cz)` in the current `component_cells` and set `output_grid[rz][cz]` to `F`.\n7.  Return the `output_grid`."
