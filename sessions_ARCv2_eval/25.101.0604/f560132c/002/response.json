            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code successfully identified the \"noisy\" shape and extracted the \"noise\" pattern in both examples. The core rendering logic (using the maximum of four neighboring points from the scaled noise grid) also seems fundamentally correct, as the colors present in the output match the noise colors.\n\nHowever, the calculation of the output grid's dimensions (and implicitly, the scaling factor) was incorrect. The initial hypothesis that the scale was simply the width of the noisy component's bounding box (`W_comp`) led to incorrect output sizes (10x10 instead of 8x8 for Ex1, 12x12 instead of 10x10 for Ex2).\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Re-evaluate Scale Calculation:** Determine the correct method for calculating the scaling factor. Based on re-analysis of the two examples:\n    *   Example 1: Noise grid is 2x2, Output is 8x8. Requires scale = 4. The noisy component's bbox width (`W_comp`) is 5.\n    *   Example 2: Noise grid is 2x2, Output is 10x10. Requires scale = 5. The noisy component's bbox width (`W_comp`) is 6.\n    *   A consistent relationship appears: `Scale = W_comp - 1`.\n2.  **Update Output Size Calculation:** Use the correctly derived `Scale` to calculate the output dimensions: `H_out = H_noise * Scale`, `W_out = W_noise * Scale`.\n3.  **Refine Implementation:** Modify the `_find_noise_grid_and_scale` helper function to return `scale = W_comp - 1` instead of `W_comp`. The rest of the `transform` function (noise extraction and rendering logic) should remain largely the same.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics based on the **revised understanding** (Scale = W_comp - 1):\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input Grid:** 20x20\n*   **Noisy Component:** Color 2, Bbox (1,1) to (5,5), `H_comp=5`, `W_comp=5`\n*   **Border Color:** 2\n*   **Noise Pixels:** {(2,2): 1, (2,3): 5, (3,2): 8, (3,3): 9}\n*   **Noise Bbox:** (2,2) to (3,3), `H_noise=2`, `W_noise=2`\n*   **Noise Grid:** `[[1, 5], [8, 9]]`\n*   **Scale Calculation:** `Scale = W_comp - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4`\n*   **Output Dimensions Calculation:** `H_out = H_noise * Scale = 2 * 4 = 8`, `W_out = W_noise * Scale = 2 * 4 = 8`\n*   **Expected Output Dimensions:** 8x8 (Matches)\n*   **Expected Output Colors:** {1, 5, 8, 9} (Matches noise grid colors)\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input Grid:** 20x20\n*   **Noisy Component:** Color 6, Bbox (4,4) to (11,9), `H_comp=8`, `W_comp=6`\n*   **Border Color:** 6\n*   **Noise Pixels:** {(6,5): 2, (6,6): 4, (7,5): 8, (7,6): 3}\n*   **Noise Bbox:** (6,5) to (7,6), `H_noise=2`, `W_noise=2`\n*   **Noise Grid:** `[[2, 4], [8, 3]]`\n*   **Scale Calculation:** `Scale = W_comp - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5`\n*   **Output Dimensions Calculation:** `H_out = H_noise * Scale = 2 * 5 = 10`, `W_out = W_noise * Scale = 2 * 5 = 10`\n*   **Expected Output Dimensions:** 10x10 (Matches)\n*   **Expected Output Colors:** {2, 3, 4, 8} (Matches noise grid colors)\n\n## Facts\n\n```yaml\ntask_type: grid_transformation\n\ninput_features:\n  grid_dimensions: variable (e.g., [20, 20])\n  background_color: 0\n  objects:\n    - type: shape # Connected component of non-zero cells\n      properties:\n        - color: integer (1-9)\n        - contiguity: 4-directional\n        - cells: list of (row, col) tuples\n        - bounding_box: (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c)\n        - dimensions: (H_comp, W_comp) # Height/Width of bounding_box\n        - colors_present: set of unique colors within the component\n        - is_noisy: boolean (True if len(colors_present) > 1)\n        - border_color: integer (most frequent color if is_noisy, else the single color)\n    - type: noise_pixel\n      properties:\n        - color: integer (1-9)\n        - location: (row, col)\n        - container_shape_color: integer # The border_color of the shape it's inside\n      constraints:\n        - Exists only within a 'noisy' shape\n        - color != 0\n        - color != container_shape_color\n\noutput_features:\n  grid_dimensions: [H_out, W_out] # Derived, see relationships\n  content: grid derived from the noise pattern of the unique noisy input shape\n\nrelationships:\n  - type: containment\n    description: Exactly one shape ('noisy_shape') contains noise pixels.\n  - type: transformation\n    description: The noise pattern within the 'noisy_shape' is scaled and rendered to produce the output grid.\n  - type: scale_determination\n    description: |\n      The integer scaling factor ('Scale') is determined by the width of the\n      bounding box of the 'noisy_shape' (`W_comp`).\n      Scale = W_comp - 1.\n  - type: output_size_determination\n    description: |\n      The output grid dimensions (`H_out`, `W_out`) are determined by scaling the\n      dimensions of the minimal bounding box of the noise pixels (`H_noise`, `W_noise`)\n      by the calculated 'Scale'.\n      H_out = H_noise * Scale\n      W_out = W_noise * Scale\n  - type: rendering_rule\n    description: |\n      Each output pixel's color at `(r_out, c_out)` is determined by:\n      1.

For each component, record its member cells, the set of unique colors present within it, and its overall bounding box.\n2.  **Find Noisy Shape:** Locate the single component that contains more than one unique color. This is the `noisy_shape`. Record the width of its bounding box as `W_comp`.\n3.  **Determine Border Color:** Within the `noisy_shape`, identify the color that appears most frequently. This is the `border_color`. (If there's a tie in frequency, select the largest color value.)\n4.  **Extract Noise Pattern:**\n    a.  Identify all cells within the `noisy_shape` whose color is *not* the `border_color`. These are the `noise_pixels`.\n    b.  Determine the minimal bounding box that encloses all `noise_pixels`. Let its dimensions be `H_noise` x `W_noise`.\n    c.  Create a new grid, `noise_grid`, of size `H_noise` x `W_noise`. Populate it with the colors of the `noise_pixels`, placing them relative to the top-left corner of their minimal bounding box.\n5.  **Calculate Scale and Output Size:**\n    a.  Calculate the scaling factor: `Scale = W_comp - 1`.\n    b.  Calculate the dimensions of the output grid: `H_out = H_noise * Scale`, `W_out = W_noise * Scale`.\n6.  **Render Output Grid:** Create an output grid of size `H_out` x `W_out`, initialized to 0. For each pixel `(r_out, c_out)` in the output grid (from row 0 to `H_out-1`, col 0 to `W_out-1`):\n    a.  Map the output pixel location to fractional coordinates in the `noise_grid` space: `r_f = r_out / Scale`, `c_f = c_out / Scale`.\n    b.  Identify the four integer coordinate points in the `noise_grid` space defined by the floor and ceiling of the fractional coordinates:\n        i.   `P_tl = (floor(r_f), floor(c_f))`\n        ii.  `P_tr = (floor(r_f), ceil(c_f))`\n        iii. `P_bl = (ceil(r_f), floor(c_f))`\n        iv.  `P_br = (ceil(r_f), ceil(c_f))`\n    c.  For each point `P = (nr, nc)` identified in step 6b:\n        i.   Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the bounds of the `noise_grid` (`0 <= nr < H_noise` and `0 <= nc < W_noise`).\n        ii.  If within bounds, get the value `noise_grid[nr][nc]`.\n        iii. If out of bounds, use the value 0.\n    d.  Collect the four values obtained in step 6c.\n    e.  Assign the maximum of these four values to the output pixel `output_grid[r_out][c_out]`.\n7.  **Return Output:** Return the completed `output_grid`."
