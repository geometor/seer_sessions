relationships:
  - type: containment
    description: Exactly one shape ('noisy_shape') contains noise pixels.
  - type: transformation
    description: The noise pattern within the 'noisy_shape' is scaled and rendered to produce the output grid.
  - type: scale_determination
    description: |
      The integer scaling factor ('Scale') is determined by the width of the
      bounding box of the 'noisy_shape' (`W_comp`).
      Scale = W_comp - 1.
  - type: output_size_determination
    description: |
      The output grid dimensions (`H_out`, `W_out`) are determined by scaling the
      dimensions of the minimal bounding box of the noise pixels (`H_noise`, `W_noise`)
      by the calculated 'Scale'.
      H_out = H_noise * Scale
      W_out = W_noise * Scale
  - type: rendering_rule
    description: |
      Each output pixel's color at `(r_out, c_out)` is determined by:
      1. Mapping `(r_out, c_out)` to fractional coordinates `(r_f, c_f)` in the
         noise grid space: `r_f = r_out / Scale`, `c_f = c_out / Scale`.
      2. Identifying the four noise grid integer coordinate points surrounding `(r_f, c_f)`:
         `(floor(r_f), floor(c_f))`, `(floor(r_f), ceil(c_f))`,
         `(ceil(r_f), floor(c_f))`, `(ceil(r_f), ceil(c_f))`.
      3. Retrieving the color values from the noise grid at these four points.
         Out-of-bounds lookups are treated as 0.
      4. Assigning the maximum of these four color values to the output pixel `(r_out, c_out)`.

actions:
  - find_components: Identify all 4-directionally connected components of non-zero cells.
  - identify_noisy_shape: Find the unique component containing more than one distinct color. Store its bounding box dimensions (`H_comp`, `W_comp`).
  - determine_border_color: Find the most frequent color within the noisy shape.
  - extract_noise_pixels: Identify all pixels within the noisy shape whose color is not the border color.
  - calculate_noise_bbox: Find the minimal bounding box containing all noise pixels. Store its dimensions (`H_noise`, `W_noise`).
  - create_noise_grid: Create a grid of size `H_noise` x `W_noise` containing the noise pixels relative to their bounding box origin.
  - calculate_scale: Compute `Scale = W_comp - 1`.
  - calculate_output_size: Compute `H_out = H_noise * Scale`, `W_out = W_noise * Scale`.
  - render_output: Create the output grid of size `H_out` x `W_out` using the rendering_rule described above.
