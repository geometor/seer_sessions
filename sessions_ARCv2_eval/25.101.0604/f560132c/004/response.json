            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous analysis correctly identified the noisy shape, extracted the noise pattern, and determined the scaling factor (`Scale = W_comp - 1`). The output grid dimensions calculated using this scale also matched the expected dimensions.\n\nHowever, the rendering logic, which used the `max()` of the four surrounding noise grid points corresponding to the scaled output pixel's location, produced incorrect results. The generated outputs differed significantly from the expected outputs, although the size and color palette were correct.\n\nThe comparison reveals that the transformation is likely a direct upscaling or \"nearest neighbor\" scaling based on the floor of the scaled coordinates. Each pixel in the `noise_grid` appears to be expanded into a `Scale` x `Scale` block in the output grid, rather than interpolated using the maximum value of neighbors.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Revise Rendering Rule:** Modify the rendering step to assign the color of the output pixel `(r_out, c_out)` based *only* on the noise grid pixel at `(floor(r_out / Scale), floor(c_out / Scale))`.\n2.  **Update Documentation:** Reflect this simpler rendering rule in the Facts YAML and the Natural Language Program.\n3.  **Maintain Core Logic:** Keep the existing logic for identifying the noisy component, extracting the noise grid, and calculating the scale factor, as these parts appear correct.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe metrics calculation remains largely the same as the previous step regarding the identification of the noisy shape, noise grid, and scale factor, as these were correctly determined. The key difference lies in *why* the output was wrong \u2013 previously attributed to scale, now identified as the rendering algorithm.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input Grid:** 20x20\n*   **Noisy Component:** Color 2, Bbox (1,1) to (5,5), `W_comp=5`\n*   **Border Color:** 2\n*   **Noise Grid:** `[[1, 5], [8, 9]]`, `H_noise=2`, `W_noise=2`\n*   **Scale:** `W_comp - 1 = 4`\n*   **Output Dimensions:** `H_out = 2 * 4 = 8`, `W_out = 2 * 4 = 8` (Correct)\n*   **Rendering Discrepancy:** `max()` rule produced `[[1, 5...],[8, 9...]]` etc., while expected output corresponds to `noise_grid[floor(r/4), floor(c/4)]`.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input Grid:** 20x20\n*   **Noisy Component:** Color 6, Bbox (4,4) to (11,9), `W_comp=6`\n*   **Border Color:** 6\n*   **Noise Grid:** `[[2, 4], [8, 3]]`, `H_noise=2`, `W_noise=2`\n*   **Scale:** `W_comp - 1 = 5`\n*   **Output Dimensions:** `H_out = 2 * 5 = 10`, `W_out = 2 * 5 = 10` (Correct)\n*   **Rendering Discrepancy:** `max()` rule produced `[[2, 4...],[8, 8...]]` etc., while expected output corresponds to `noise_grid[floor(r/5), floor(c/5)]`.\n\n## Facts\n\n```yaml\ntask_type: grid_transformation\n\ninput_features:\n  grid_dimensions: variable\n  background_color: 0\n  objects:\n    - type: shape # Connected component of non-zero cells\n      properties:\n        - color: integer (1-9)\n        - contiguity: 4-directional\n        - cells: list of (row, col) tuples\n        - bounding_box: (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c)\n        - dimensions: (H_comp, W_comp) # Height/Width of bounding_box\n        - colors_present: set of unique colors within the component\n        - is_noisy: boolean (True if len(colors_present) > 1)\n        - border_color: integer (most frequent color if is_noisy, tie-break with max color value)\n    - type: noise_pixel\n      properties:\n        - color: integer (1-9)\n        - location: (row, col)\n        - container_shape_color: integer # The border_color of the shape it's inside\n      constraints:\n        - Exists only within a 'noisy' shape\n        - color != 0\n        - color != container_shape_color\n\noutput_features:\n  grid_dimensions: [H_out, W_out] # Derived, see relationships\n  content: grid derived by scaling the noise pattern of the unique noisy input shape\n\nrelationships:\n  - type: containment\n    description: Exactly one shape ('noisy_shape') contains noise pixels.\n  - type: transformation\n    description: The noise pattern within the 'noisy_shape' is scaled up to produce the output grid.\n  - type: scale_determination\n    description: |\n      The integer scaling factor ('Scale') is determined by the width of the\n      bounding box of the 'noisy_shape' (`W_comp`).\n      Scale = W_comp - 1.\n  - type: output_size_determination\n    description: |\n      The output grid dimensions (`H_out`, `W_out`) are determined by scaling the\n      dimensions of the minimal bounding box of the noise pixels (`H_noise`, `W_noise`)\n      by the calculated 'Scale'.\n      H_out = H_noise * Scale\n      W_out = W_noise * Scale\n  - type: rendering_rule # Revised rule\n    description: |\n      Each output pixel's color at `(r_out, c_out)` is determined by the color\n      of the single corresponding pixel in the noise grid.\n      The corresponding noise grid coordinates `(nr, nc)` are found by integer division\n      (or floor of float division):\n      `nr = floor(r_out / Scale)`\n      `nc = floor(c_out / Scale)`\n      The output pixel `(r_out, c_out)` takes the color `noise_grid[nr][nc]`.\n      (Implicitly handles boundaries as the mapping stays within the scaled area).\n\nactions:\n  - find_components: Identify all 4-directionally connected components of non-zero cells.\n  - identify_noisy_shape: Find the unique component containing more than one distinct color.

For each component, record its member cells, the set of unique colors present within it, and its overall bounding box.\n2.  **Find Noisy Shape:** Locate the single component that contains more than one unique color. This is the `noisy_shape`. Record the width of its bounding box as `W_comp`.\n3.  **Determine Border Color:** Within the `noisy_shape`, identify the color that appears most frequently. This is the `border_color`. (If there's a tie in frequency, select the largest color value.)\n4.  **Extract Noise Pattern:**\n    a.  Identify all cells within the `noisy_shape` whose color is *not* the `border_color`. These are the `noise_pixels`.\n    b.  Determine the minimal bounding box that encloses all `noise_pixels`. Let its dimensions be `H_noise` x `W_noise`.\n    c.  Create a new grid, `noise_grid`, of size `H_noise` x `W_noise`. Populate it with the colors of the `noise_pixels`, placing them relative to the top-left corner of their minimal bounding box.\n5.  **Calculate Scale and Output Size:**\n    a.  Calculate the scaling factor: `Scale = W_comp - 1`. Ensure `Scale` is at least 1.\n    b.  Calculate the dimensions of the output grid: `H_out = H_noise * Scale`, `W_out = W_noise * Scale`.\n6.  **Render Output Grid:** Create an output grid of size `H_out` x `W_out`, initialized to 0. For each pixel `(r_out, c_out)` in the output grid (from row 0 to `H_out-1`, col 0 to `W_out-1`):\n    a.  Determine the corresponding source pixel coordinates in the `noise_grid` by integer division:\n        `nr = r_out // Scale`\n        `nc = c_out // Scale`\n    b.  Assign the color from the source noise pixel to the output pixel: `output_grid[r_out][c_out] = noise_grid[nr][nc]`.\n7.  **Return Output:** Return the completed `output_grid`."
