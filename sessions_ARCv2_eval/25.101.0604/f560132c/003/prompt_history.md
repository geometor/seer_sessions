## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The input is a 2D grid of integers (colors), typically 20x20. The output is also a 2D grid of integers, but smaller (e.g., 8x8, 10x10).
2.  **Input Content:** The input grid contains multiple contiguous areas (shapes) of non-zero integers (colors) on a background of 0. Usually, one of these shapes contains smaller regions of different non-zero integers within its boundary, which are distinct from its own primary color. I'll call these internal colors "noise".
3.  **Core Task:** The primary goal is to identify the shape containing this internal "noise", extract the pattern of the noise itself, and then render this pattern onto the output grid.
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   **Identification:** Locate the single shape whose constituent cells include values different from both the shape's main color and the background color (0).
    *   **Extraction:** Isolate the noise pattern. This involves finding the minimum bounding box containing only the noise pixels (excluding the main shape color and background 0). This forms a smaller `noise_grid`.
    *   **Scaling:** Determine the dimensions of the `noise_grid` (`H_n`, `W_n`) and the output grid (`H_out`, `W_out`). Calculate an integer scaling factor, `scale = H_out / H_n = W_out / W_n`.
    *   **Rendering:** Generate the output grid by mapping each output pixel `(r, c)` back to the `noise_grid` space and determining its color based on the noise values in its vicinity. The exact rendering rule appears complex, but seems strongly related to taking the *maximum* color value from a small neighborhood (potentially 4 specific neighbors) in the `noise_grid` corresponding to the output pixel's scaled location. Boundary conditions (when neighbors fall outside the `noise_grid`) likely default to a value of 0.

  - type: rendering_rule # Tentative hypothesis
    description: |
      Each output pixel's color is determined by the maximum color value
      among the four noise grid cells surrounding the output pixel's
      mapped location in the noise grid space. Out-of-bounds noise cells
      are treated as having a value of 0.

actions:
  - identify_noisy_shape: Find the unique shape containing internal noise pixels.
  - extract_noise_grid: Determine the minimal bounding box of noise pixels and create the noise_grid.
  - calculate_scale: Compute the scaling factor based on output grid and noise_grid dimensions.
  - render_output: For each output pixel, map its location, identify relevant noise neighbors, apply max function (with boundary handling), and assign color.

```

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Target Shape:** Scan the input grid to find connected components (shapes) of non-zero colors. Identify the unique shape that contains pixels whose colors are neither the shape's primary color nor the background color (0). Let the primary color of this shape be `border_color`.
2.  **Extract Noise Pattern:**
    a.  Determine the bounding box of the identified target shape.
    b.  Within this bounding box, find all pixels whose color is not `border_color` and not 0. These are the "noise pixels".
    c.  Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by these noise pixels.
    d.  Create a new grid, `noise_grid`, containing only these noise pixels, relative to their minimum row/column indices. Let the dimensions of `noise_grid` be `H_noise` x `W_noise`.
3.  **Determine Scaling:** Get the dimensions of the output grid, `H_out` x `W_out`. Calculate the scaling factor `scale = H_out / H_noise`. (Verify that `W_out / W_noise` yields the same integer scale).
4.  **Render Output Grid:** Create an output grid of size `H_out` x `W_out`. For each pixel `(r, c)` in the output grid (from row 0 to `H_out-1`, col 0 to `W_out-1`):
    a.  Map the output pixel location `(r, c)` to fractional coordinates in the `noise_grid` space: `r_f = r / scale`, `c_f = c / scale`.
    b.  Identify the four integer grid points surrounding `(r_f, c_f)` in the `noise_grid`:
        i.  `P_tl = (floor(r_f), floor(c_f))`
        ii. `P_tr = (floor(r_f), ceil(c_f))`
        iii. `P_bl = (ceil(r_f), floor(c_f))`
        iv. `P_br = (ceil(r_f), ceil(c_f))`
    c.  Initialize a list of neighbor values.
    d.  For each point `P = (nr, nc)` identified in step 4b:
        i.  Check if the coordinates `(nr, nc)` are within the bounds of the `noise_grid` (i.e., `0 <= nr < H_noise` and `0 <= nc < W_noise`).
        ii. If within bounds, add the value `noise_grid[nr][nc]` to the list of neighbor values.
        iii. If out of bounds, add the value 0 to the list of neighbor values.
    e.  Assign the color to the output pixel `(r, c)` by finding the maximum value in the list of neighbor values collected in step 4d.

"""
Transforms the input grid according to the following process:
1. Identify the unique 'noisy' shape (a connected component containing multiple colors).
   The 'border' color is the most frequent color in the component.
2. Extract the 'noise' pixels (those differing from the shape's border color)
   into a minimal bounding box grid ('noise_grid').
3. Determine the scale factor by calculating the width of the bounding box
   of the entire noisy component found in step 1.
4. Determine the output grid size by scaling the noise_grid dimensions by the scale factor.
5. Render the output grid: For each output pixel (r_out, c_out), map it to fractional
   coordinates (r_f, c_f) in the noise_grid space. Find the maximum color value among
   the four noise grid cells whose coordinates are derived using floor and ceil
   of (r_f, c_f): (floor(r_f), floor(c_f)), (floor(r_f), ceil(c_f)),
   (ceil(r_f), floor(c_f)), (ceil(r_f), ceil(c_f)). Out-of-bounds lookups return 0.

"""
Transforms the input grid according to the following process:
1. Identify the unique 'noisy' shape (a connected component containing multiple colors).
   The 'border' color is the most frequent color in the component.
2. Extract the 'noise' pixels (those differing from the shape's border color)
   into a minimal bounding box grid ('noise_grid').
3. Determine the scale factor by calculating the width of the bounding box
   of the entire noisy component found in step 1.
4. Determine the output grid size by scaling the noise_grid dimensions by the scale factor.
5. Render the output grid: For each output pixel (r_out, c_out), map it to fractional
   coordinates (r_f, c_f) in the noise_grid space. Find the maximum color value among
   the four noise grid cells whose coordinates are derived using floor and ceil

## General Assessment

The previous code successfully identified the "noisy" shape and extracted the "noise" pattern in both examples. The core rendering logic (using the maximum of four neighboring points from the scaled noise grid) also seems fundamentally correct, as the colors present in the output match the noise colors.

However, the calculation of the output grid's dimensions (and implicitly, the scaling factor) was incorrect. The initial hypothesis that the scale was simply the width of the noisy component's bounding box (`W_comp`) led to incorrect output sizes (10x10 instead of 8x8 for Ex1, 12x12 instead of 10x10 for Ex2).

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Re-evaluate Scale Calculation:** Determine the correct method for calculating the scaling factor. Based on re-analysis of the two examples:
    *   Example 1: Noise grid is 2x2, Output is 8x8. Requires scale = 4. The noisy component's bbox width (`W_comp`) is 5.
    *   Example 2: Noise grid is 2x2, Output is 10x10. Requires scale = 5. The noisy component's bbox width (`W_comp`) is 6.
    *   A consistent relationship appears: `Scale = W_comp - 1`.
2.  **Update Output Size Calculation:** Use the correctly derived `Scale` to calculate the output dimensions: `H_out = H_noise * Scale`, `W_out = W_noise * Scale`.
3.  **Refine Implementation:** Modify the `_find_noise_grid_and_scale` helper function to return `scale = W_comp - 1` instead of `W_comp`. The rest of the `transform` function (noise extraction and rendering logic) should remain largely the same.

## Metrics

Metrics based on the **revised understanding** (Scale = W_comp - 1):

**Example 1:**

*   **Input Grid:** 20x20
*   **Noisy Component:** Color 2, Bbox (1,1) to (5,5), `H_comp=5`, `W_comp=5`
*   **Border Color:** 2
*   **Noise Pixels:** {(2,2): 1, (2,3): 5, (3,2): 8, (3,3): 9}
*   **Noise Bbox:** (2,2) to (3,3), `H_noise=2`, `W_noise=2`
*   **Noise Grid:** `[[1, 5], [8, 9]]`
*   **Scale Calculation:** `Scale = W_comp - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4`
*   **Output Dimensions Calculation:** `H_out = H_noise * Scale = 2 * 4 = 8`, `W_out = W_noise * Scale = 2 * 4 = 8`
*   **Expected Output Dimensions:** 8x8 (Matches)
*   **Expected Output Colors:** {1, 5, 8, 9} (Matches noise grid colors)

**Example 2:**

*   **Input Grid:** 20x20
*   **Noisy Component:** Color 6, Bbox (4,4) to (11,9), `H_comp=8`, `W_comp=6`
*   **Border Color:** 6
*   **Noise Pixels:** {(6,5): 2, (6,6): 4, (7,5): 8, (7,6): 3}
*   **Noise Bbox:** (6,5) to (7,6), `H_noise=2`, `W_noise=2`
*   **Noise Grid:** `[[2, 4], [8, 3]]`
*   **Scale Calculation:** `Scale = W_comp - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5`
*   **Output Dimensions Calculation:** `H_out = H_noise * Scale = 2 * 5 = 10`, `W_out = W_noise * Scale = 2 * 5 = 10`
*   **Expected Output Dimensions:** 10x10 (Matches)
*   **Expected Output Colors:** {2, 3, 4, 8} (Matches noise grid colors)

      2. Identifying the four noise grid integer coordinate points surrounding `(r_f, c_f)`:
         `(floor(r_f), floor(c_f))`, `(floor(r_f), ceil(c_f))`,
         `(ceil(r_f), floor(c_f))`, `(ceil(r_f), ceil(c_f))`.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Components:** Scan the input grid and identify all distinct connected components (shapes) formed by adjacent non-zero cells (using 4-directional connectivity). For each component, record its member cells, the set of unique colors present within it, and its overall bounding box.
2.  **Find Noisy Shape:** Locate the single component that contains more than one unique color. This is the `noisy_shape`. Record the width of its bounding box as `W_comp`.
3.  **Determine Border Color:** Within the `noisy_shape`, identify the color that appears most frequently. This is the `border_color`. (If there's a tie in frequency, select the largest color value.)
4.  **Extract Noise Pattern:**
    a.  Identify all cells within the `noisy_shape` whose color is *not* the `border_color`. These are the `noise_pixels`.
    b.  Determine the minimal bounding box that encloses all `noise_pixels`. Let its dimensions be `H_noise` x `W_noise`.
    c.  Create a new grid, `noise_grid`, of size `H_noise` x `W_noise`. Populate it with the colors of the `noise_pixels`, placing them relative to the top-left corner of their minimal bounding box.
5.  **Calculate Scale and Output Size:**
    a.  Calculate the scaling factor: `Scale = W_comp - 1`.
    b.  Calculate the dimensions of the output grid: `H_out = H_noise * Scale`, `W_out = W_noise * Scale`.
6.  **Render Output Grid:** Create an output grid of size `H_out` x `W_out`, initialized to 0. For each pixel `(r_out, c_out)` in the output grid (from row 0 to `H_out-1`, col 0 to `W_out-1`):
    a.  Map the output pixel location to fractional coordinates in the `noise_grid` space: `r_f = r_out / Scale`, `c_f = c_out / Scale`.
    b.  Identify the four integer coordinate points in the `noise_grid` space defined by the floor and ceiling of the fractional coordinates:
        i.   `P_tl = (floor(r_f), floor(c_f))`
        ii.  `P_tr = (floor(r_f), ceil(c_f))`
        iii. `P_bl = (ceil(r_f), floor(c_f))`
        iv.  `P_br = (ceil(r_f), ceil(c_f))`
    c.  For each point `P = (nr, nc)` identified in step 6b:
        i.   Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the bounds of the `noise_grid` (`0 <= nr < H_noise` and `0 <= nc < W_noise`).
        ii.  If within bounds, get the value `noise_grid[nr][nc]`.
        iii. If out of bounds, use the value 0.
    d.  Collect the four values obtained in step 6c.
    e.  Assign the maximum of these four values to the output pixel `output_grid[r_out][c_out]`.
7.  **Return Output:** Return the completed `output_grid`.
