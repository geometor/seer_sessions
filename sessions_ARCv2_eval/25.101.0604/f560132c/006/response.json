            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous analysis successfully identified the core components of the task: finding the unique \"noisy\" shape, extracting the \"noise\" pixels into a minimal grid, and calculating the correct scaling factor (`Scale = W_comp - 1`). The output dimensions derived using this scale were also correct.\n\nHowever, the rendering algorithm used in the last attempt (nearest neighbor scaling based on `floor(coord / Scale)`) produced incorrect results. The attempt prior to that used a different rendering rule (`max` of four neighbors defined by `floor`/`ceil` of scaled coordinates) but failed because it used an incorrect *scale factor*.\n\nThe evidence suggests that the correct approach combines the accurate scale factor determination (`Scale = W_comp - 1`) with the `max(floor/ceil neighbors)` rendering rule. The failure in the first execution attempt was primarily due to the incorrect scale, not the rendering logic itself. The failure in the second attempt was due to using an oversimplified rendering logic.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  Reinstate the rendering logic from the first attempt: calculate the output pixel color as the maximum value among the four noise grid cells whose coordinates are derived using `math.floor` and `math.ceil` on the scaled output coordinates (`r_out / Scale`, `c_out / Scale`).\n2.  Ensure the correct scale factor (`Scale = W_comp - 1`) is used in conjunction with this rendering rule.\n3.  Update the documentation (Facts YAML and Natural Language Program) to accurately reflect this combined approach.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe metrics regarding the identification process remain consistent with the previous analysis, as these parts were correctly implemented:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input Grid:** 20x20\n*   **Noisy Component:** Color 2, Bbox (1,1) to (5,5), `W_comp=5`\n*   **Border Color:** 2\n*   **Noise Grid:** `[[1, 5], [8, 9]]`, `H_noise=2`, `W_noise=2`\n*   **Scale Calculation:** `Scale = W_comp - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4` (Correct)\n*   **Output Dimensions Calculation:** `H_out = 2 * 4 = 8`, `W_out = 2 * 4 = 8` (Correct)\n*   **Rendering Discrepancy (Last Attempt):** Nearest neighbor produced blocky output `[[1,1,1,1, 5,5,5,5],...]`. Expected output requires a more complex rendering based on neighbors.\n*   **Proposed Rendering:** `max(noise_safe(floor(r/4), floor(c/4)), ..., noise_safe(ceil(r/4), ceil(c/4)))` is expected to yield the correct output.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input Grid:** 20x20\n*   **Noisy Component:** Color 6, Bbox (4,4) to (11,9), `W_comp=6`\n*   **Border Color:** 6\n*   **Noise Grid:** `[[2, 4], [8, 3]]`, `H_noise=2`, `W_noise=2`\n*   **Scale Calculation:** `Scale = W_comp - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5` (Correct)\n*   **Output Dimensions Calculation:** `H_out = 2 * 5 = 10`, `W_out = 2 * 5 = 10` (Correct)\n*   **Rendering Discrepancy (Last Attempt):** Nearest neighbor produced blocky output `[[2,2,2,2,2, 4,4,4,4,4],...]`. Expected output requires a more complex rendering.\n*   **Proposed Rendering:** `max(noise_safe(floor(r/5), floor(c/5)), ..., noise_safe(ceil(r/5), ceil(c/5)))` is expected to yield the correct output.\n\n## Facts\n\n```yaml\ntask_type: grid_transformation\n\ninput_features:\n  grid_dimensions: variable\n  background_color: 0\n  objects:\n    - type: shape # Connected component of non-zero cells\n      properties:\n        - color: integer (1-9)\n        - contiguity: 4-directional\n        - cells: list of (row, col) tuples\n        - bounding_box: (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c)\n        - dimensions: (H_comp, W_comp) # Height/Width of bounding_box\n        - colors_present: set of unique colors within the component\n        - is_noisy: boolean (True if len(colors_present) > 1)\n        - border_color: integer (most frequent color if is_noisy, tie-break with max color value)\n    - type: noise_pixel\n      properties:\n        - color: integer (1-9)\n        - location: (row, col)\n        - container_shape_color: integer # The border_color of the shape it's inside\n      constraints:\n        - Exists only within a 'noisy' shape\n        - color != 0\n        - color != container_shape_color\n\noutput_features:\n  grid_dimensions: [H_out, W_out] # Derived, see relationships\n  content: grid derived by scaling and interpolating (using max) the noise pattern of the unique noisy input shape\n\nrelationships:\n  - type: containment\n    description: Exactly one shape ('noisy_shape') contains noise pixels.\n  - type: transformation\n    description: The noise pattern within the 'noisy_shape' is scaled up and rendered using a max-neighbor rule to produce the output grid.\n  - type: scale_determination\n    description: |\n      The integer scaling factor ('Scale') is determined by the width of the\n      bounding box of the 'noisy_shape' (`W_comp`).\n      Scale = W_comp - 1.\n  - type: output_size_determination\n    description: |\n      The output grid dimensions (`H_out`, `W_out`) are determined by scaling the\n      dimensions of the minimal bounding box of the noise pixels (`H_noise`, `W_noise`)\n      by the calculated 'Scale'.\n      H_out = H_noise * Scale\n      W_out = W_noise * Scale\n  - type: rendering_rule # Revised rule (back to original hypothesis, with correct scale)\n    description: |\n      Each output pixel's color at `(r_out, c_out)` is determined by:\n      1.

For each component, record its member cells, the set of unique colors present within it, and its overall bounding box.\n2.  **Find Noisy Shape:** Locate the single component that contains more than one unique color. This is the `noisy_shape`. Record the width of its bounding box as `W_comp`.\n3.  **Determine Border Color:** Within the `noisy_shape`, identify the color that appears most frequently. This is the `border_color`. (If there's a tie in frequency, select the largest color value.)\n4.  **Extract Noise Pattern:**\n    a.  Identify all cells within the `noisy_shape` whose color is *not* the `border_color`. These are the `noise_pixels`.\n    b.  Determine the minimal bounding box that encloses all `noise_pixels`. Let its dimensions be `H_noise` x `W_noise`.\n    c.  Create a new grid, `noise_grid`, of size `H_noise` x `W_noise`. Populate it with the colors of the `noise_pixels`, placing them relative to the top-left corner of their minimal bounding box.\n5.  **Calculate Scale and Output Size:**\n    a.  Calculate the scaling factor: `Scale = W_comp - 1`. If `Scale` is not positive, the transformation cannot be applied.\n    b.  Calculate the dimensions of the output grid: `H_out = H_noise * Scale`, `W_out = W_noise * Scale`.\n6.  **Render Output Grid:** Create an output grid of size `H_out` x `W_out`, initialized to 0. For each pixel `(r_out, c_out)` in the output grid (from row 0 to `H_out-1`, col 0 to `W_out-1`):\n    a.  Map the output pixel location to fractional coordinates in the `noise_grid` space: `r_f = r_out / Scale`, `c_f = c_out / Scale`.\n    b.  Identify the four integer coordinate points in the `noise_grid` space defined by the floor and ceiling of the fractional coordinates:\n        i.   `P_tl = (floor(r_f), floor(c_f))`\n        ii.  `P_tr = (floor(r_f), ceil(c_f))`\n        iii. `P_bl = (ceil(r_f), floor(c_f))`\n        iv.  `P_br = (ceil(r_f), ceil(c_f))`\n    c.  For each point `P = (nr, nc)` identified in step 6b:\n        i.   Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the bounds of the `noise_grid` (`0 <= nr < H_noise` and `0 <= nc < W_noise`).\n        ii.  If within bounds, get the value `noise_grid[nr][nc]`.\n        iii. If out of bounds, use the value 0.\n    d.  Collect the four values obtained in step 6c.\n    e.  Assign the **maximum** of these four values to the output pixel `output_grid[r_out][c_out]`.\n7.  **Return Output:** Return the completed `output_grid`."
