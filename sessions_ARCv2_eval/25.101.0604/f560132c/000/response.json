The output is also a 2D grid of integers, but smaller (e.g., 8x8, 10x10).\n2.  **Input Content:** The input grid contains multiple contiguous areas (shapes) of non-zero integers (colors) on a background of 0. Usually, one of these shapes contains smaller regions of different non-zero integers within its boundary, which are distinct from its own primary color. I'll call these internal colors \"noise\".\n3.  **Core Task:** The primary goal is to identify the shape containing this internal \"noise\", extract the pattern of the noise itself, and then render this pattern onto the output grid.\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   **Identification:** Locate the single shape whose constituent cells include values different from both the shape's main color and the background color (0).\n    *   **Extraction:** Isolate the noise pattern. This involves finding the minimum bounding box containing only the noise pixels (excluding the main shape color and background 0). This forms a smaller `noise_grid`.\n    *   **Scaling:** Determine the dimensions of the `noise_grid` (`H_n`, `W_n`) and the output grid (`H_out`, `W_out`). Calculate an integer scaling factor, `scale = H_out / H_n = W_out / W_n`.\n    *   **Rendering:** Generate the output grid by mapping each output pixel `(r, c)` back to the `noise_grid` space and determining its color based on the noise values in its vicinity. The exact rendering rule appears complex, but seems strongly related to taking the *maximum* color value from a small neighborhood (potentially 4 specific neighbors) in the `noise_grid` corresponding to the output pixel's scaled location. Boundary conditions (when neighbors fall outside the `noise_grid`) likely default to a value of 0.\n\n## Facts\n\n```yaml\ntask_type: grid_transformation\n\ninput_features:\n  grid_dimensions: [20, 20] # Example, can vary\n  background_color: 0\n  objects:\n    - type: shape\n      properties:\n        - color: integer (1-9)\n        - contiguity: cells of the same color are connected\n        - contains_noise: boolean (typically only one shape is True)\n    - type: noise_pixel\n      properties:\n        - color: integer (1-9)\n        - location: (row, col)\n        - container_shape_color: integer (color of the shape it's inside)\n      constraints:\n        - color != 0\n        - color != container_shape_color\n\noutput_features:\n  grid_dimensions: variable (e.g., [8, 8], [10, 10]) depends on input\n  content: grid derived from the noise pattern of one input shape\n\nrelationships:\n  - type: containment\n    description: One shape contains noise pixels.\n  - type: transformation\n    description: The noise pattern within the identified shape is scaled and rendered to produce the output grid.\n  - type: scaling\n    description: |\n      Output grid dimensions are an integer multiple ('scale')\n      of the noise pattern's minimal bounding box dimensions.\n  - type: rendering_rule # Tentative hypothesis\n    description: |\n      Each output pixel's color is determined by the maximum color value\n      among the four noise grid cells surrounding the output pixel's\n      mapped location in the noise grid space.

Identify the unique shape that contains pixels whose colors are neither the shape's primary color nor the background color (0). Let the primary color of this shape be `border_color`.\n2.  **Extract Noise Pattern:**\n    a.  Determine the bounding box of the identified target shape.\n    b.  Within this bounding box, find all pixels whose color is not `border_color` and not 0. These are the \"noise pixels\".\n    c.  Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by these noise pixels.\n    d.  Create a new grid, `noise_grid`, containing only these noise pixels, relative to their minimum row/column indices. Let the dimensions of `noise_grid` be `H_noise` x `W_noise`.\n3.  **Determine Scaling:** Get the dimensions of the output grid, `H_out` x `W_out`. Calculate the scaling factor `scale = H_out / H_noise`. (Verify that `W_out / W_noise` yields the same integer scale).\n4.  **Render Output Grid:** Create an output grid of size `H_out` x `W_out`. For each pixel `(r, c)` in the output grid (from row 0 to `H_out-1`, col 0 to `W_out-1`):\n    a.  Map the output pixel location `(r, c)` to fractional coordinates in the `noise_grid` space: `r_f = r / scale`, `c_f = c / scale`.\n    b.  Identify the four integer grid points surrounding `(r_f, c_f)` in the `noise_grid`:\n        i.  `P_tl = (floor(r_f), floor(c_f))`\n        ii. `P_tr = (floor(r_f), ceil(c_f))`\n        iii. `P_bl = (ceil(r_f), floor(c_f))`\n        iv. `P_br = (ceil(r_f), ceil(c_f))`\n    c.  Initialize a list of neighbor values.\n    d.  For each point `P = (nr, nc)` identified in step 4b:\n        i.  Check if the coordinates `(nr, nc)` are within the bounds of the `noise_grid` (i.e., `0 <= nr < H_noise` and `0 <= nc < W_noise`).\n        ii. If within bounds, add the value `noise_grid[nr][nc]` to the list of neighbor values.\n        iii. If out of bounds, add the value 0 to the list of neighbor values.\n    e.  Assign the color to the output pixel `(r, c)` by finding the maximum value in the list of neighbor values collected in step 4d."
