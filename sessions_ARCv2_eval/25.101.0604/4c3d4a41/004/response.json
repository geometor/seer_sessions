            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe provided execution results show that the previous code (`code_00.py`) failed to correctly transform the input grids for both training examples, resulting in 16 incorrect pixels in each case. The core concepts identified (Main Frame, Background, Content Colors, Non-Frame 5s, looking down columns) seem relevant, but their implementation or the precise rules were flawed.\n\n**Analysis of Failures:**\n\n1.  **Non-Frame 5 Transformation:** The code's transformed output incorrectly handled internal non-frame 5s (e.g., `input[1,15]=5`, `input[1,17]=5` in Example 1). Instead of adopting the content color from the cell below (as per the expected output and the code's documented Rule 4b), the transformed output left them as 5 or turned them to 0 incorrectly. This suggests either a bug in the implementation of that specific rule or, more likely, an issue where these internal 5s were mistakenly included in the `main_frame_mask`, preventing the non-frame 5 rule from being applied.\n2.  **Content Color Transformation:** The code's \"look down for 0 before 5\" rule (Rule 4c) correctly identified cases where a content color should become 5 (when 0 was below). However, it *incorrectly* transformed some content colors to 5 when they should have remained unchanged according to the expected output (e.g., `T[1,11]=5` vs `E[1,11]=3`). This indicates the condition for *keeping* the original content color (i.e., when a 5 is encountered below before a 0) needs re-evaluation or refinement, or the interaction with other rules is causing unexpected changes.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-affirm Main Frame Identification:** Ensure the logic correctly identifies only the *largest edge-touching* component of 5s. Internal disconnected 5s must be excluded.\n2.  **Refine Rule Application Order/Logic:** Process the grid cell by cell, determining the output color based *purely* on the input grid state and the pre-calculated main frame mask. Avoid bottom-up processing for now, as simpler input-based rules haven't been perfectly implemented yet.\n3.  **Correct Non-Frame 5 Rule Application:** Explicitly check if an input 5 is *not* part of the main frame mask. Apply the rule: if `input[r+1, c]` is content color, output = `input[r+1, c]`, else output = 0.\n4.  **Refine Content Color Rule:** Maintain the \"look down for 0 before 5\" logic. If 0 is found first (or boundary), output = 5. If 5 is found first, output = original content color. Critically re-examine the cases where this failed previously (e.g., `input[1,11]`) to ensure no edge cases or interactions are missed. Perhaps the look-down should stop if it encounters a different content color? No, the examples don't support this. Let's stick to the \"0 before 5\" rule but ensure it's applied correctly *only* to cells identified as content colors *not* part of the main frame.\n5.  **Update Documentation:** Reflect the refined understanding in the YAML and NLP.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the provided `code_execution` results for `code_00.py`:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Match:** False\n*   **Pixels Off:** 16\n*   **Size Correct:** True\n*   **Input Size:** 8x20 (160 pixels)\n*   **Output Size:** 8x20 (160 pixels)\n*   **Pixel Accuracy:** (160 - 16) / 160 = 144 / 160 = 90.0%\n*   **Color Palette Correct:** True\n*   **Color Count Correct:** False\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Match:** False\n*   **Pixels Off:** 16\n*   **Size Correct:** True\n*   **Input Size:** 8x20 (160 pixels)\n*   **Output Size:** 8x20 (160 pixels)\n*   **Pixel Accuracy:** (160 - 16) / 160 = 144 / 160 = 90.0%\n*   **Color Palette Correct:** True\n*   **Color Count Correct:** False\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n*   The consistent number of incorrect pixels (16) across different inputs strongly suggests systematic errors in applying specific rules, likely the non-frame 5 rule and the content color rule's condition for preserving the original color.\n*   High pixel accuracy (90%) indicates the overall structure preservation (main frame, background) is mostly correct.\n*   Incorrect color counts confirm that the errors lie in the transformation logic applied to non-frame 5s and content colors within the frame.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n```yaml\ndefinitions:\n  - name: FRAME_COLOR\n    value: 5\n  - name: BACKGROUND_COLOR\n    value: 0\n  - name: CONTENT_COLOR\n    value: any color that is not FRAME_COLOR and not BACKGROUND_COLOR\n\nelements:\n  - object: grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array of integers (colors)\n      - size: H x W (constant per task)\n      - source: input | output\n  - object: cell\n    properties:\n      - coordinates: (r, c) where 0 <= row < H, 0 <= column < W\n      - color: integer (from grid)\n      - role: determined by color and location relative to main_frame\n  - object: main_frame\n    properties:\n      - color: FRAME_COLOR\n      - connectivity: The largest connected component of FRAME_COLOR cells in the input grid that touches at least one edge of the grid.\n      - scope: A boolean mask (H x W) indicating membership.\n\nactions:\n  - action: identify_main_frame\n    inputs:\n      - input_grid\n      - FRAME_COLOR\n    outputs:\n      - main_frame_mask: H x W boolean grid\n  - action: determine_output_color\n    inputs:\n      - cell_coordinates: (r, c)\n      - input_grid: H x W array\n      - main_frame_mask: H x W boolean grid\n    process:\n      - Get input_color = input_grid[r, c]\n      - Check if main_frame_mask[r, c] is True.\n      - If yes (is_main_frame):\n          - output_color = FRAME_COLOR\n      - Else (not_main_frame):\n          - If input_color == FRAME_COLOR (is_non_frame_5):\n              - Get color_below_in = input_grid[r+1, c] (handle boundary: treat as BACKGROUND_COLOR).\n              - If color_below_in is CONTENT_COLOR:\n                 - output_color = color_below_in\n              - Else:\n                 - output_color = BACKGROUND_COLOR\n          - Else if input_color is CONTENT_COLOR:\n              - Look down column c from row r+1 in input_grid.\n              - Find the first row index `r_look >= r+1` where `input_grid[r_look, c]` is BACKGROUND_COLOR or FRAME_COLOR.\n              - If BACKGROUND_COLOR is found first (or boundary reached without finding FRAME_COLOR):\n                 - output_color = FRAME_COLOR\n              - Else (FRAME_COLOR is found first):\n                 - output_color = input_color # Keep original content color\n          - Else (input_color == BACKGROUND_COLOR):\n              - output_color = BACKGROUND_COLOR\n    outputs:\n      - output_color: integer for cell (r, c) in the output grid\n\nalgorithm:\n  - step: Initialize output_grid with same dimensions as input_grid.\n  - step: Identify main_frame_mask from input_grid using identify_main_frame.\n  - step: For each cell (r, c) from (0, 0) to (H-1, W-1):\n      - Execute determine_output_color(r, c, input_grid, main_frame_mask).\n      - Assign the result to output_grid[r, c].\n  - step: Return output_grid.\n```\n\n## Natural Language Program\n\n1.  **Define Constants:** Define `FRAME_COLOR` as 5 and `BACKGROUND_COLOR` as 0. Any color that is not 0 or 5 is a `CONTENT_COLOR`.\n2.  **Identify Main Frame:** Analyze the input grid. Find the largest connected component of `FRAME_COLOR` cells where at least one cell in the component touches any edge (top, bottom, left, or right) of the grid. Create a boolean mask `main_frame_mask` indicating which cells belong to this Main Frame.\n3.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid (the output grid) with the same dimensions as the input grid.\n4.  **Process Each Cell:** Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid:\n    a.  **Check Main Frame:** If `main_frame_mask[r, c]` is true, set `output[r, c]` to `FRAME_COLOR`.\n    b.  **Check Background:** If `main_frame_mask[r, c]` is false and `input[r, c]` is `BACKGROUND_COLOR`, set `output[r, c]` to `BACKGROUND_COLOR`.\n    c.  **Check Non-Frame 5:** If `main_frame_mask[r, c]` is false and `input[r, c]` is `FRAME_COLOR`:\n        i.  Determine the color directly below in the input: `color_below_in = input[r+1, c]`. If `r+1` is outside the grid height, treat `color_below_in` as `BACKGROUND_COLOR`.\n        ii. If `color_below_in` is a `CONTENT_COLOR`, set `output[r, c]` to `color_below_in`.\n        iii. Otherwise (if `color_below_in` is `FRAME_COLOR` or `BACKGROUND_COLOR`), set `output[r, c]` to `BACKGROUND_COLOR`.\n    d.  **Check Content Color:** If `main_frame_mask[r, c]` is false and `input[r, c]` is a `CONTENT_COLOR`:\n        i.  Look downwards in the input grid's column `c`, starting from row `r+1`.\n        ii. Search for the first occurrence of either `BACKGROUND_COLOR` (0) or `FRAME_COLOR` (5).\n        iii. If `BACKGROUND_COLOR` is encountered *before* `FRAME_COLOR`, or if the bottom boundary of the grid is reached without encountering `FRAME_COLOR`, set `output[r, c]` to `FRAME_COLOR`.\n        iv. If `FRAME_COLOR` is encountered *before* `BACKGROUND_COLOR`, set `output[r, c]` to the original `input[r, c]` color.\n5.  **Return Output:** The fully populated output grid is the result."
