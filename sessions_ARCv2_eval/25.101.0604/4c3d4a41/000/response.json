            "text": "**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of integers, representing colors (0=black, 5=blue, etc.). The grid dimensions remain constant (8x20 in the examples).\n2.  **Background Color:** The color 0 acts as the background.\n3.  **Frame Color:** The color 5 is significant. It forms a prominent, often rectangular or near-rectangular, \"frame\" or border in both input and output. This main frame appears largely preserved.\n4.  **Other Colors:** Colors other than 0 and 5 exist within the frame. These colors change between input and output.\n5.  **Positional Relationships:** The transformation seems highly dependent on the vertical relationship between adjacent cells (the cell directly below).\n6.  **Types of 5s:** There appear to be three types of cells with color 5 in the input:\n    *   **Main Frame:** A large connected component of 5s, usually touching the grid edges. These persist in the output.\n    *   **Internal 5s:** Isolated 5s or small groups of 5s located *inside* the area enclosed by the Main Frame (e.g., `train_1` input at (1,15), (1,17)). These seem to change based on the cell below.\n    *   **External 5s:** 5s located *outside* the area enclosed by the Main Frame (e.g., `train_1` input at (2,1), (3,3), etc.). These are removed (changed to 0) in the output.\n7.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation involves:\n    *   Preserving the Main Frame.\n    *   Removing External 5s.\n    *   Modifying Internal 5s based on the color of the cell below them.\n    *   Modifying other internal colors (non-0, non-5) based on the color of the cell below them (specifically, changing to 5 if the cell below is 0 or potentially if it's the same color under certain conditions).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nelements:\n  - object: grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array of integers (colors)\n      - size: constant (e.g., 8x20)\n  - object: cell\n    properties:\n      - coordinates: (row, column)\n      - color: integer (0-9)\n  - object: color\n    properties:\n      - value: integer\n      - role:\n          - 0: background\n          - 5: frame_color\n          - others: content_colors\n  - object: main_frame\n    properties:\n      - color: 5 (frame_color)\n      - connectivity: largest connected component of frame_color cells\n      - location: typically forms a border, potentially touching grid edges\n    relationships:\n      - encloses: inner_area\n  - object: inner_area\n    properties:\n      - location: region enclosed by main_frame\n      - content: cells containing background, frame_color, or content_colors\n  - object: non_frame_5\n    properties:\n      - color: 5 (frame_color)\n    relationships:\n      - location: not part of main_frame\n      - classification:\n          - internal (inside inner_area)\n          - external (outside inner_area)\n\nactions:\n  - action: identify_main_frame\n    inputs:\n      - input_grid\n      - frame_color\n    outputs:\n      - set of main_frame cell coordinates\n  - action: classify_non_frame_5s\n    inputs:\n      - input_grid\n      - frame_color\n      - main_frame coordinates\n    outputs:\n      - set of external_5 coordinates\n      - set of internal_5 coordinates\n  - action: transform_cell\n    inputs:\n      - current_cell (r, c)\n      - input_grid\n      - main_frame coordinates\n    process:\n      - determine current color `V_curr = input[r][c]`\n      - determine color below `V_below = input[r+1][c]` (handle boundaries)\n      - check if `(r, c)` is main_frame, internal_5, external_5, or other\n      - apply rules based on type and `V_below`\n    outputs:\n      - output_color for cell (r, c)\n\nrules:\n  - rule: preserve_main_frame\n    condition: cell is part of main_frame\n    action: output_color = frame_color\n  - rule: remove_external_5s\n    condition: cell is an external_5\n    action: output_color = background_color\n  - rule: propagate_into_internal_5s\n    condition: cell is an internal_5\n    action: |\n      if V_below is a content_color:\n        output_color = V_below\n      else:\n        output_color = background_color\n  - rule: fill_above_background\n    condition: V_curr is a content_color AND V_below is background_color\n    action: output_color = frame_color\n  - rule: handle_vertical_repeats (less certain)\n    condition: V_curr is a content_color AND V_below == V_curr\n    action: output_color = frame_color (potentially only if at end of repeat sequence)\n  - rule: default_copy\n    condition: none of the above apply\n    action: output_color = V_curr\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Define the Frame Color as 5 and the Background Color as 0.\n2.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n3.  Identify the largest connected component of Frame Color cells in the input grid that touches any edge of the grid; this is the \"Main Frame\".\n4.  Identify all input cells `(r, c)` that have the Frame Color but are *not* part of the Main Frame. These are \"Non-Frame 5s\".\n5.  Iterate through each Non-Frame 5 cell `(r, c)` identified in step 4:\n    a.  Examine the color of the cell directly below it in the input grid, `V_below = input[r+1][c]` (treating out-of-bounds as Background Color).\n    b.  If `V_below` is not the Background Color and not the Frame Color (i.e., it's a content color), set the `output[r][c]` to `V_below`.\n    c.  Otherwise (if `V_below` is Background Color or Frame Color), set `output[r][c]` to Background Color.\n6.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` in the grid, excluding the last row (i.e., for `r` from 0 to height-2):\n    a.  Consider the input color `V_curr = input[r][c]` and the input color below `V_below = input[r+1][c]`.\n    b.  If `V_curr` is *not* the Frame Color and *not* the Background Color (i.e., it's a content color):\n        i.  If `V_below` is the Background Color, set `output[r][c]` to the Frame Color.\n        (*Note: Leave other content colors unchanged from the initial copy, unless modified by step 5 or step 6.b.i. The rule for vertical repeats seems inconsistent or complex and is omitted for clarity, relying on the above two rules which cover many observed changes.*)\n7.  The final output grid contains the result of these modifications."
