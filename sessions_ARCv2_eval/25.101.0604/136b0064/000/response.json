The output is also a grid of numbers (7 columns wide, same number of rows as the input).\n2.  **Separator Column:** Column index 7 (the 8th column) in the input grid consistently contains the digit '4' and appears to function as a separator between two regions of the input: the left region (columns 0-6) and the right region (columns 8-14).\n3.  **Output Source:** The output grid seems primarily derived from the right region (columns 8-14) of the input grid.\n4.  **Conditional Logic:** There appears to be a conditional rule based on the content of the right region (columns 8-14) of each input row.\n    *   **Condition 1:** If the right region of an input row contains *any* non-zero digits, the corresponding output row is a direct copy of that right region.\n    *   **Condition 2:** If the right region of an input row contains *only* zeros, the corresponding output row is derived from the left region (columns 0-6) of the input row through a more complex transformation.\n5.  **Rule 2 Transformation (R=0 case):** When the right region is all zeros, the transformation of the left region involves identifying patterns or segments of non-zero numbers within the left 7 columns. The specific output generated seems to depend on the pattern found (e.g., `[2 2 2]`, `[3 3 3]`, `[6]`, `[1 1]`), often involving a change in the digit used (e.g., `2`s become `1`s, `6`s become `3`s, `1`s become `2`s) and potentially a shift in position or change in shape/length. The exact rules for this transformation appear complex and possibly context-dependent or based on a specific mapping key not immediately obvious.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n```yaml\nGrid:\n  Input:\n    Type: 2D array of integers\n    Dimensions:\n      Rows: variable (N)\n      Columns: 15\n    Structure:\n      Left_Region: Columns 0-6\n      Separator: Column 7 (Value typically '4')\n      Right_Region: Columns 8-14\n  Output:\n    Type: 2D array of integers\n    Dimensions:\n      Rows: N (same as input)\n      Columns: 7\nRelationship: Row-wise transformation from Input to Output\nTransformationRule:\n  Type: Conditional\n  Condition: Check if Input.Right_Region for the current row contains any non-zero values.\n  Case_1: # Right_Region has non-zero values\n    Action: Copy Input.Right_Region to the corresponding Output row.\n  Case_2: # Right_Region contains only zero values\n    Action:\n      - Analyze Input.Left_Region for the current row.\n      - Identify specific patterns or segments of non-zero digits within Input.Left_Region.\n      - Generate the Output row based on the identified pattern(s).\n      - This generation may involve:\n          - Selecting a specific pattern from Input.Left_Region.\n          - Mapping the pattern's digits to new digits (e.g., 2->1, 6->3, 1->2).\n          - Arranging the transformed digits into the 7-column Output row, possibly with positional shifts or shape changes.\n      - The precise mapping/transformation for Case_2 seems specific to the task patterns.\n```\n\n## Natural Language Program\n\n1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same number of rows as the input grid and 7 columns.\n2.  For each row in the input grid (from top to bottom):\n    a.  Extract the left region (columns 0 through 6).\n    b.  Extract the right region (columns 8 through 14).\n    c.  Check if any digit in the extracted right region is non-zero.\n    d.  **If** the right region contains at least one non-zero digit:\n        i.  Copy the right region directly into the corresponding row of the output grid.\n    e.  **Else** (the right region contains only zeros):\n        i.  Analyze the pattern of non-zero digits in the extracted left region.\n        ii. Determine the appropriate 7-digit output sequence based on the specific pattern found in the left region (this involves a predefined transformation rule specific to the patterns encountered in this task, potentially changing digits and their arrangement).\n        iii. Place this generated 7-digit sequence into the corresponding row of the output grid.\n3.  Return the completed output grid."
