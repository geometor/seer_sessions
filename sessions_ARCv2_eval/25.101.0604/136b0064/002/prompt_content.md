"""
Transforms an input grid based on a conditional rule applied row by row.

The input grid has 15 columns. Column 7 acts as a separator.
The output grid has 7 columns.

Transformation Rule:
1. For each row in the input grid:
2. Examine the 'right region' (columns 8-14).
3. If the 'right region' contains any non-zero digits:
    - The corresponding output row is a direct copy of the 'right region'.
4. If the 'right region' contains only zero digits:
    - The corresponding output row is generated by transforming the 'left region' (columns 0-6) based on specific, predefined patterns found within that region.
    - A heuristic mapping is used to find the first known pattern in the left region and produce a corresponding output. If no known pattern is matched, a default zero row is output.
