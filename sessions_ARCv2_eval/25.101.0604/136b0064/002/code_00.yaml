Grid:
  Input:
    Type: 2D array of integers
    Dimensions:
      Rows: variable (N)
      Columns: 15
    Structure:
      Left_Region: Columns 0-6
      Separator: Column 7 (Value typically '4')
      Right_Region: Columns 8-14
  Output:
    Type: 2D array of integers
    Dimensions:
      Rows: N (same as input)
      Columns: 7
State:
  Variable: memory
  Type: 1D array of integers (size 7)
  Initial_Value: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  Update_Rule: Updated whenever the Transformation Rule Case_2b is executed. Stores the output `O` generated in that step.
Relationship: Row-wise transformation from Input to Output, dependent on State.
TransformationRule:
  Type: Conditional, Stateful
  Condition: Check if Input.Right_Region for the current row (`R`) contains any non-zero values.
  Case_1: # R has non-zero values
    Action:
      - Output is a direct copy of `R`.
      - `memory` state remains unchanged.
  Case_2: # R contains only zero values
    Action:
      - Examine Input.Left_Region for the current row (`L`).
      - Sub_Condition_A: Check if `L` contains only zero values.
        - Action:
            - Output is the current value of `memory`.
            - `memory` state remains unchanged.
      - Sub_Condition_B: Check if `L` contains non-zero values.
        - Action:
            - Determine the output row `O` by applying a transformation function: `O = map(L, memory)`.
            - This mapping function is complex, depends on patterns within `L`, and potentially the current state of `memory`. The exact rules for `map(L, memory)` are not fully determined but involve identifying specific numeric patterns/shapes in `L` and producing a corresponding 7-element output sequence. The context (`memory`) seems crucial for resolving ambiguities where the same `L` can produce different `O`.
            - Output is `O`.
            - Update `memory` state to `O`.
