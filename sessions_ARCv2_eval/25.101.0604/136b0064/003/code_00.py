"""
Transforms an input grid based on a conditional rule applied row by row, 
incorporating a memory state.

The input grid has 15 columns. Column 7 acts as a separator.
The output grid has 7 columns.

State:
  A 'memory' variable (list of 7 integers) stores the last output generated
  when the input row's right region (cols 8-14) was all zeros and the
  left region (cols 0-6) was non-zero. It's initialized to all zeros.

Transformation Rule:
1. For each row in the input grid:
2. Extract the left region 'L' (cols 0-6) and right region 'R' (cols 8-14).
3. Check if 'R' contains any non-zero values.
4. If 'R' has non-zero values:
    - The output row is a direct copy of 'R'.
    - The 'memory' state remains unchanged.
5. If 'R' contains only zero values:
    - Check if 'L' contains only zero values.
    - If 'L' contains only zero values:
        - The output row is a copy of the current 'memory' state.
        - The 'memory' state remains unchanged.
    - If 'L' contains non-zero values:
        - Determine the output row 'O' by applying a transformation function
          based on patterns in 'L' and potentially the current 'memory'.
          This mapping is complex and not fully determined. A placeholder
          heuristic is used for now.
        - The output row is 'O'.
        - Update the 'memory' state to become 'O'.
