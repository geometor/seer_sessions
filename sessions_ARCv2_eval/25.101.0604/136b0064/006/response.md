## General Assessment

The previous execution (`code_02`) successfully solved Examples 2 and 3 by implementing a stateful approach with detailed lookup maps (`TRANSFORM_MAP` for `R=0, L!=0` cases and `L_ZERO_EXCEPTION_MAP` for `R=0, L=0` exceptions). However, it failed significantly on Example 1.

Analysis of the failure in Example 1 reveals a fundamental issue: the transformation rules associated with specific pairs of (Left Region `L`, `memory` state) are *not consistent* across different examples. Even when prioritizing rules from later examples (like Ex3), the resulting map breaks the logic required for Example 1. Specifically, the very first transformation step in Ex1 (Row 1) requires a different output for the same initial `(L, memory)` state compared to Ex3 (Row 1).

This indicates that the state representation `(L, memory)` is insufficient to determine the output uniquely. The transformation function `map(L, memory) -> O` and the logic for L=0 exceptions are context-dependent in a way not captured by the current model. The factor distinguishing the contexts (e.g., why Ex1 behaves differently from Ex3 initially) is unclear â€“ it could be related to the history preceding the current state, properties of the initial non-zero Right Region, or a more complex algorithmic rule governing the transformations.

The strategy must shift away from attempting to create a single, comprehensive static lookup map. Instead, we should acknowledge the high-level structure (stateful, conditional based on R and L) but recognize that the core transformation logic requires further algorithmic understanding or identification of additional context/state factors.

The failure cascades after the first mismatch due to the incorrect `memory` state propagating and required `(L, memory)` pairs subsequently not being found in the map.

```yaml
Grid:
  Input:
    Type: 2D array of integers
    Dimensions:
      Rows: variable (N)
      Columns: 15
    Structure:
      Left_Region (L): Columns 0-6
      Separator: Column 7 (Value '4')
      Right_Region (R): Columns 8-14
  Output:
    Type: 2D array of integers
    Dimensions:
      Rows: N (same as input)
      Columns: 7
State:
  Variable: memory
  Type: 1D array of integers (size 7)
  Initial_Value: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  Update_Rule: Updated only when R=0 and L!=0. Stores the output `O` generated in that step.
Relationship: Row-wise transformation from Input to Output, dependent on State and Context.
TransformationRule:
  Type: Conditional, Stateful, Context-Dependent
  Condition: Check if Input.Right_Region (`R`) for the current row contains any non-zero values.
  Case_1: # R has non-zero values
    Action:
      - Output (`O`) is a direct copy of `R`.
      - `memory` state remains unchanged.
  Case_2: # R contains only zero values
    Action:
      - Examine Input.Left_Region (`L`) for the current row.
      - Sub_Condition_A: Check if `L` contains only zero values.
        - Action:
            - Output (`O`) is determined by the current `memory` state, but the function is not always identity.
            - `O = func(memory)`. Observations show `func` is often identity, but sometimes transforms the pattern in `memory` (e.g., based on digit value and position).
            - The exact rule for `func(memory)` appears context-dependent or requires further analysis.
            - `memory` state remains unchanged.
      - Sub_Condition_B: Check if `L` contains non-zero values.
        - Action:
            - Determine the output row `O` by applying a complex transformation function: `O = map(L, memory, context)`.
            - This mapping function depends on the patterns within `L`, the current state of `memory`, and potentially other contextual factors (unidentified).
            - **Crucially, the same `(L, memory)` pair can yield different `O` values across different examples, indicating the mapping is not static and depends on context.**
            - Output is `O`.
            - Update `memory` state to `O`.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize a state variable `memory` as a list of 7 zeros: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
2.  Initialize an empty list called `output_grid`.
3.  For each `input_row` in the `input_grid` (processed sequentially):
    a.  Extract the left region `L` (columns 0-6) and the right region `R` (columns 8-14).
    b.  Check if `R` contains any non-zero numbers.
    c.  **If** `R` contains non-zero numbers:
        i.  Set the `current_output_row` to be a copy of `R`.
        ii. Do not change the `memory` state.
    d.  **Else** (`R` contains only zeros):
        i.  Check if `L` contains only zero numbers.
        ii. **If** `L` contains only zeros:
            *   Determine the `current_output_row` by applying a transformation rule based on the current `memory` state. (This rule often results in copying `memory`, but sometimes involves transforming the pattern within `memory` based on context or specific conditions not fully determined).
            *   Do not change the `memory` state.
        iii. **Else** (`L` contains non-zero numbers):
            *   Determine the `current_output_row` (`O`) by applying a complex, context-dependent transformation function. This function uses the pattern of non-zero digits in `L`, the current state of `memory`, and potentially other unidentified contextual factors from the input or processing history. (The exact algorithm is not determined, as the same L and memory state can lead to different outputs in different examples).
            *   Update the `memory` state to become a copy of the `current_output_row` (`O`) just determined.
    e.  Append the `current_output_row` to the `output_grid`.
4.  Return the completed `output_grid`.
