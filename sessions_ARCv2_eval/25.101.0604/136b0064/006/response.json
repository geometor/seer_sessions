            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous execution (`code_02`) successfully solved Examples 2 and 3 by implementing a stateful approach with detailed lookup maps (`TRANSFORM_MAP` for `R=0, L!=0` cases and `L_ZERO_EXCEPTION_MAP` for `R=0, L=0` exceptions). However, it failed significantly on Example 1.\n\nAnalysis of the failure in Example 1 reveals a fundamental issue: the transformation rules associated with specific pairs of (Left Region `L`, `memory` state) are *not consistent* across different examples. Even when prioritizing rules from later examples (like Ex3), the resulting map breaks the logic required for Example 1. Specifically, the very first transformation step in Ex1 (Row 1) requires a different output for the same initial `(L, memory)` state compared to Ex3 (Row 1).\n\nThis indicates that the state representation `(L, memory)` is insufficient to determine the output uniquely. The transformation function `map(L, memory) -> O` and the logic for L=0 exceptions are context-dependent in a way not captured by the current model. The factor distinguishing the contexts (e.g., why Ex1 behaves differently from Ex3 initially) is unclear \u2013 it could be related to the history preceding the current state, properties of the initial non-zero Right Region, or a more complex algorithmic rule governing the transformations.\n\nThe strategy must shift away from attempting to create a single, comprehensive static lookup map. Instead, we should acknowledge the high-level structure (stateful, conditional based on R and L) but recognize that the core transformation logic requires further algorithmic understanding or identification of additional context/state factors.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nCode `code_02` execution results:\n- **Example 1:** Failed (24 Pixels Off)\n- **Example 2:** Passed (0 Pixels Off)\n- **Example 3:** Passed (0 Pixels Off)\n\n**Detailed Analysis of Example 1 Mismatches (Code `code_02`):**\n\n| Row Idx | Input L           | R=0? | L=0? | `memory` (Start)        | Expected `O`      | Actual `O` (Code 2) | Mismatch Type        | Notes                                                                  |\n| :------ | :---------------- | :--- | :--- | :---------------------- | :---------------- | :------------------ | :------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | `(2,0,2,0,0,6,0)` | Yes  | No   | `(0,0,0,0,0,0,0)`       | `[2,2,0,0,0,0,0]` | `[0,0,0,2,2,0,0]`   | `map(L,mem)` conflict | Map used Ex3 R1 logic, incorrect for Ex1 R1. `memory` diverges.       |\n| 2       | `(2,2,2,0,0,6,0)` | Yes  | No   | `(0,0,0,2,2,0,0)`       | `[1,1,1,0,0,0,0]` | `[0,0,0,6,0,0,0]`   | `map(L,mem)` conflict | Used map entry from Ex3 R2 based on incorrect `memory`. `memory` diverges. |\n| 3       | `(0,0,0,0,0,0,0)` | Yes  | Yes  | `(0,0,0,6,0,0,0)`       | `[0,0,1,1,1,0,0]` | `[0,0,0,6,0,0,0]`   | `L=0` rule fail      | `memory` state not in `L_ZERO_EXCEPTION_MAP`.
