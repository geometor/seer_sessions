actions:
  - action: identify_components
    description: Find all connected components of non-zero cells.
  - action: filter_multi_color_components
    description: Select components with more than one unique non-zero color.
  - action: determine_max_color
    description: Find the maximum color value in a component.
  - action: identify_interface_cells
    description: Find interface cells within a component.
  - action: remove_cells
    description: Change the color of specified cells to the background color (0) in the output grid.
    variants:
      - type: remove_all_max_color_cells
        condition: if component's max_color is 7
        target: all cells in the component with color 7

        target: interface cells whose color is max_color
  - action: determine_propagation_columns
    description: Identify columns where color propagation should occur.
    variants:
      - type: median_column_of_removed
        condition: if max_color was 7
        input: columns where color 7 was removed
        output: single median column index
      - type: columns_of_topmost_removed_max_interface
        condition: if max_color was not 7
        input: set of removed max_color interface cells, component's min_row_in_col mapping
        output: set of columns where a removed cell was the topmost component cell in that column
  - action: propagate_max_color_upwards
    description: Fill a vertical block of background cells with the component's max_color.
    trigger: For each column identified by determine_propagation_columns.
    target: Contiguous block of background (0) cells in the input grid ending immediately below the component's minimum row in that column.
    color: The component's max_color.

relationships:
  - relationship: adjacency
    description: Cells sharing an edge or corner (8-way).
  - relationship: within_component
    description: A cell belongs to a specific connected component.
  - relationship: color_interface
    description: An interface cell is adjacent to another cell within the same component with a different non-zero color.
  - relationship: topmost_in_column
    description: A cell (r, c) is the topmost cell of a component in column c if no other cell (r', c) with r' < r belongs to the component.

anomalies:
  - anomaly: Example 1 shows horizontal modification/propagation rather than the vertical propagation observed in Examples 2 and 3. The removal rule also seems different (removing interface 7s, not all 7s). This suggests Example 1 might follow a distinct transformation rule not covered by the primary logic derived from Examples 2 and 3.
