## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code, based on removing all interface cells and propagating the max color upwards, failed on all examples. The results show significant discrepancies, indicating the removal and propagation rules were incorrect or incomplete.

*   **Example 1 Failure:** The code removed too many cells (all interface cells, not just max color ones) and performed vertical propagation instead of the observed horizontal changes.
*   **Example 2 Failure:** The code removed too many cells (all interface). While vertical propagation occurred, the specific columns and removal logic were wrong according to the initial code's implementation (removing *all* interface cells).
*   **Example 3 Failure:** The code removed only interface cells, while the expected output removed *all* cells of the max color (7). The propagation columns were also incorrect.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Removal Rule:** Differentiate between cases. It appears that only `max_color` interface cells are typically removed (Rule A), but if `max_color` is 7, *all* 7s are removed (Rule B).
2.  **Refine Propagation Rule:** Vertical upward propagation into the block of zeros below the component's top seems common (Examples 2 & 3). The *trigger* for which columns get propagated needs refinement.
    *   For Rule A (max_color != 7): Propagation seems tied to columns where the *topmost* cell of the component was a removed `max_color` interface cell.
    *   For Rule B (max_color == 7): Propagation seems to occur only in the *median* column among those where 7s were removed.
3.  **Address Example 1 Anomaly:** Example 1 shows horizontal changes rather than vertical propagation. This might be a distinct rule possibly related to component shape or specific color pairs, or it might involve converting adjacent background cells rather than propagating into blocks. Given its difference, the primary focus will be on creating a rule for Examples 2 and 3, acknowledging that Example 1 may follow a different pattern.

anomalies:
  - anomaly: Example 1 shows horizontal modification/propagation rather than the vertical propagation observed in Examples 2 and 3. The removal rule also seems different (removing interface 7s, not all 7s). This suggests Example 1 might follow a distinct transformation rule not covered by the primary logic derived from Examples 2 and 3.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Identify all distinct connected components of non-zero cells in the `input_grid` using 8-way adjacency. Keep track of the cells belonging to each component.
3.  For each identified component:
    a.  Determine the set of unique non-zero colors present.
    b.  If the component contains only one unique non-zero color, skip to the next component.
    c.  If the component contains multiple unique non-zero colors:
        i.   Determine the maximum color value (`max_color`).
        ii.  Initialize an empty set `propagation_columns`.
        iii. **Removal Step:**
            *   **Case 1: `max_color` is 7:**
                1.  Identify all cells `(r, c)` within the component having color 7.
                2.  Record the set of columns `removed_cols` containing these cells.
                3.  In the `output_grid`, change the color of all these identified cells to 0.
                4.  If `removed_cols` is not empty, sort the unique column indices in `removed_cols` and find the median column index (e.g., the element at index `floor(count / 2)`). Add this single median column to `propagation_columns`.
            *   **Case 2: `max_color` is not 7:**
                1.  Identify all interface cells within the component.
                2.  Identify the subset of interface cells that have the `max_color` (`max_interface_cells`).
                3.  For each `max_interface_cell` at `(r, c)`:
                    a.  Check if this cell `(r, c)` is the topmost cell of the component in column `c` (i.e., no other component cell `(r', c)` exists with `r' < r`).
                    b.  If it is the topmost, add column `c` to `propagation_columns`.
                    c.  In the `output_grid`, change the color of this cell `(r, c)` to 0.
        iv. **Propagation Step:**
            *   For each column `c` in `propagation_columns`:
                1.  Find the minimum row index (`min_row_col`) occupied by *any* cell of the original component in column `c`.
                2.  Starting from row `r_trace = min_row_col - 1` and moving upwards: Identify the contiguous block of cells `(r, c)` where `r <= r_trace` that have color 0 in the *input_grid*.
                3.  In the `output_grid`, change the color of all cells in this identified block to `max_color`.
4.  Return the `output_grid`.
