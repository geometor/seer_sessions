## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided code successfully solves Example 3, indicating the core logic for handling components where `max_color = 7` (remove all 7s, propagate vertically in the median column) is correct under certain conditions.

However, the code fails on Examples 1 and 2:

1.  **Example 1 Failure:** The code applies the `max_color = 7` logic (remove all 7s, vertical propagation) to the bottom component ({3, 7}), which contradicts the expected output (remove interface 7s, horizontal-like changes). It applies the `max_color != 7` logic (remove interface 6s, vertical propagation) to the top component ({4, 6}), again contradicting the expected horizontal changes. This confirms Example 1 requires a distinct transformation rule not captured by the current logic. The difference in behavior for `max_color = 7` between Example 1 (min_color=3) and Example 3 (min_color=6) suggests the rule might depend on the other colors present, potentially the `min_color`.

2.  **Example 2 Failure:** The code correctly identifies and removes the `max_color` (9) interface cells. However, it propagates the `max_color` (9) upwards in columns 1, 2, and 7, because the trigger is "any column where a max_color interface cell was removed". The expected output only shows propagation in columns 2 and 7. The reason column 1 is excluded is not immediately obvious from simple rules (like "topmost cell" or number of removed cells). The propagation mechanism (vertical block filling) seems correct, but the trigger condition needs refinement.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine `max_color = 7` Logic:** Introduce branching based on `min_color`.
    *   If `max_color = 7` AND `min_color > 3` (like Example 3): Remove *all* 7s, propagate vertically in the median column of removal.
    *   If `max_color = 7` AND `min_color <= 3` (like Example 1): This case requires a different rule (likely remove *interface* 7s and apply horizontal propagation/conversion). Acknowledge this rule is needed but cannot be fully defined from the current examples.
2.  **Refine `max_color != 7` Logic:** The current trigger ("propagate in any column where a max_color interface cell was removed") is slightly too broad (fails Ex 2 Col 1). Finding the precise exclusion criterion is difficult. For now, maintain this rule but acknowledge its imperfection. The core idea (remove max interface cells, propagate vertically) seems directionally correct for this case (as seen in Ex 2).
3.  **Focus Documentation:** Update the YAML and Natural Language program to reflect the branching logic for `max_color = 7` and the current best-guess logic for `max_color != 7`. Explicitly document Example 1 as an anomaly requiring a separate rule set, particularly regarding horizontal changes and the specific `max_color = 7` handling when `min_color` is low.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Identify all distinct connected components of non-zero cells in the `input_grid` using 8-way adjacency.
3.  For each identified component:
    a.  Determine the set of unique non-zero colors present.
    b.  If the component contains only one unique non-zero color, skip to the next component.
    c.  If the component contains multiple unique non-zero colors:
        i.   Determine the minimum color (`min_color`) and maximum color (`max_color`).
        ii.  Initialize an empty set `propagation_columns`.
        iii. **Removal Step & Propagation Column Determination:**
            *   **Case A: `max_color` is 7 AND `min_color` > 3 (like Example 3):**
                1.  Identify all cells `(r, c)` within the component having color 7.
                2.  Record the list of columns `removed_cols` containing these cells.
                3.  In the `output_grid`, change the color of all identified cells with color 7 to 0.
                4.  If `removed_cols` is not empty, sort the unique column indices and find the median column index. Add this single median column to `propagation_columns`.
            *   **Case B: `max_color` is not 7 (like Example 2):**
                1.  Identify all interface cells within the component.
                2.  Identify the subset of interface cells that have the `max_color` (`max_interface_cells`).
                3.  For each `max_interface_cell` at `(r, c)`:
                    a.  Add column `c` to `propagation_columns`. *(Note: This may include extra columns, as seen in Ex 2).*
                    b.  In the `output_grid`, change the color of this cell `(r, c)` to 0.
            *   **Case C: `max_color` is 7 AND `min_color` <= 3 (like Example 1):**
                1.  *(Anomaly)* The transformation rule is different. Based on Example 1, it seems only *interface* cells with color 7 should be removed, and the modification is likely horizontal, not vertical propagation. This specific rule is not fully implemented here. Skip propagation steps for this case based on current logic.
        iv. **Vertical Propagation Step (Applies to Case A and Case B):**
            *   For each column `c` in `propagation_columns`:
                1.  Find the minimum row index (`min_row_col`) occupied by *any* cell of the original component in column `c`.
                2.  Starting from row `r_trace = min_row_col - 1` and moving upwards: Identify the contiguous block of cells `(r, c)` where `r <= r_trace` that have color 0 in the *input_grid*.
                3.  In the `output_grid`, change the color of all cells in this identified block to `max_color`.
4.  Return the `output_grid`.
