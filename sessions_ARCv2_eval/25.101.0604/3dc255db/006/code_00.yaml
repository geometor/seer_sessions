    description: A connected group of non-zero cells (8-way adjacency).
    properties:
      - cells: set of (row, col) tuples
      - colors: set of unique non-zero integers present
      - num_colors: count of unique non-zero colors
      - min_color: minimum non-zero color value
      - max_color: maximum non-zero color value

actions:
  - action: identify_components
    description: Find all connected components of non-zero cells.
  - action: filter_multi_color_components
    description: Select components with more than one unique non-zero color.
  - action: determine_colors
    description: Find the min_color and max_color in a component.
  - action: identify_interface_cells
    description: Find interface cells within a component.
  - action: remove_cells
    description: Change the color of specified cells to 0 in the output grid based on max_color and min_color.
    variants:
      - type: remove_all_max_color_cells
        condition: if component's max_color is 7 AND component's min_color > 3
        target: all cells in the component with color 7
      - type: remove_max_color_interface_cells
        condition: if component's max_color is not 7 (OR if max_color is 7 and min_color <= 3 - see anomaly)
        target: interface cells whose color is max_color
      # Note: Example 1 suggests a specific case for max=7, min<=3 where only interface 7s are removed.
  - action: determine_propagation_columns
    description: Identify columns where vertical color propagation should occur.
    variants:
      - type: median_column_of_removed_7s
        condition: if max_color was 7 AND min_color > 3
        input: columns where color 7 was removed
        output: single median column index
      - type: columns_of_any_removed_max_interface
        condition: if max_color was not 7
        input: set of removed max_color interface cells
        output: set of columns containing any removed max_color interface cell
        # Known Issue: This may select too many columns (e.g., Ex 2, col 1).
      # Note: Example 1 suggests a different (horizontal?) propagation/modification mechanism entirely.
  - action: propagate_max_color_upwards
    description: Fill a vertical block of background cells with the component's max_color.
    trigger: For each column identified by determine_propagation_columns (excluding potential horizontal cases).
    target: Contiguous block of background (0) cells in the input grid ending immediately below the component's minimum row in that column.
    color: The component's max_color.

relationships:
  - relationship: adjacency
    description: Cells sharing an edge or corner (8-way).
  - relationship: within_component
    description: A cell belongs to a specific connected component.
  - relationship: color_interface
    description: An interface cell is adjacent to another cell within the same component with a different non-zero color.

anomalies:
  - anomaly: Training Example 1 transformation.
    description: Exhibits a different pattern not covered by the primary logic derived from Examples 2 and 3.
    details:
      - Removal Rule (max=7, min=3): Only interface 7s removed, not all 7s.
      - Propagation/Modification: Appears horizontal or involves conversion of adjacent cells, not vertical block filling.
    implication: Requires a separate rule set, potentially triggered by specific color combinations or component shapes.
