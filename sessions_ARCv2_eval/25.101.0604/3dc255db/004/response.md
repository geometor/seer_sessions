## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code successfully solved Example 3, indicating the logic for handling components where the `max_color` is 7 (remove all 7s, propagate in the median column of removal) is likely correct.

However, the code failed on Examples 1 and 2.
*   **Example 2 Failure:** The code correctly identified and removed the `max_color` (9) interface cells, but it failed to propagate the color upwards. The previous condition required the removed cell to be the *topmost* in its column for propagation to occur. The expected output shows propagation in columns 2 and 7, even though the removed cells `(5, 2)` and `(5, 7)` were not the topmost component cells in those columns (rows 3 and 3 were the respective tops). This suggests the "topmost" condition is incorrect. A revised hypothesis is that propagation occurs in *any* column where a `max_color` interface cell was removed (when `max_color != 7`).
*   **Example 1 Failure:** The transformation in Example 1 appears fundamentally different. Both components (top: {4, 6}, bottom: {3, 7}) exhibit changes that look more like horizontal filling or conversion of adjacent cells rather than the vertical block propagation seen in Examples 2 and 3. Furthermore, for the bottom component where `max_color` is 7, the expected output removes only the *interface* 7s, not *all* 7s, contradicting the rule that worked for Example 3.

**Strategy:**

1.  Modify the propagation rule for `max_color != 7`: Trigger propagation in all columns where a `max_color` interface cell is removed, removing the "topmost" requirement.
2.  Keep the `max_color = 7` rule as is (remove all 7s, propagate in the median column), as it worked for Example 3.
3.  Acknowledge that Example 1 follows a different pattern that is not yet captured by the current logic for either `max_color = 7` or `max_color != 7`. The current program will likely continue to fail on Example 1, but should now correctly handle Example 2 and Example 3. Further analysis would be needed to deduce the specific rules governing Example 1.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Identify all distinct connected components of non-zero cells in the `input_grid` using 8-way adjacency. Keep track of the cells belonging to each component.
3.  For each identified component:
    a.  Determine the set of unique non-zero colors present.
    b.  If the component contains only one unique non-zero color, skip to the next component.
    c.  If the component contains multiple unique non-zero colors:
        i.   Determine the maximum color value (`max_color`).
        ii.  Initialize an empty set `propagation_columns`.
        iii. **Removal Step:**
            *   **Case 1: `max_color` is 7:**
                1.  Identify all cells `(r, c)` within the component having color 7.
                2.  Record the set of columns `removed_cols` containing these cells.
                3.  In the `output_grid`, change the color of all these identified cells to 0.
                4.  If `removed_cols` is not empty, sort the unique column indices in `removed_cols` and find the median column index (e.g., the element at index `floor(count / 2)`). Add this single median column to `propagation_columns`.
            *   **Case 2: `max_color` is not 7:**
                1.  Identify all interface cells within the component.
                2.  Identify the subset of interface cells that have the `max_color` (`max_interface_cells`).
                3.  For each `max_interface_cell` at `(r, c)`:
                    a.  Add column `c` to `propagation_columns`.
                    b.  In the `output_grid`, change the color of this cell `(r, c)` to 0.
        iv. **Propagation Step:**
            *   For each column `c` in `propagation_columns`:
                1.  Find the minimum row index (`min_row_col`) occupied by *any* cell of the original component in column `c`.
                2.  Starting from row `r_trace = min_row_col - 1` and moving upwards: Identify the contiguous block of cells `(r, c)` where `r <= r_trace` that have color 0 in the *input_grid*.
                3.  In the `output_grid`, change the color of all cells in this identified block to `max_color`.
4.  Return the `output_grid`.

*Note:* This program is designed to handle the patterns observed in Training Examples 2 and 3. It is expected to fail on Training Example 1, which appears to follow a distinct transformation rule involving different removal logic for `max_color=7` and potentially horizontal propagation/modification.
