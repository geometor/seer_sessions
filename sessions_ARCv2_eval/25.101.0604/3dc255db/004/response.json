            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code successfully solved Example 3, indicating the logic for handling components where the `max_color` is 7 (remove all 7s, propagate in the median column of removal) is likely correct.\n\nHowever, the code failed on Examples 1 and 2.\n*   **Example 2 Failure:** The code correctly identified and removed the `max_color` (9) interface cells, but it failed to propagate the color upwards. The previous condition required the removed cell to be the *topmost* in its column for propagation to occur. The expected output shows propagation in columns 2 and 7, even though the removed cells `(5, 2)` and `(5, 7)` were not the topmost component cells in those columns (rows 3 and 3 were the respective tops). This suggests the \"topmost\" condition is incorrect. A revised hypothesis is that propagation occurs in *any* column where a `max_color` interface cell was removed (when `max_color != 7`).\n*   **Example 1 Failure:** The transformation in Example 1 appears fundamentally different. Both components (top: {4, 6}, bottom: {3, 7}) exhibit changes that look more like horizontal filling or conversion of adjacent cells rather than the vertical block propagation seen in Examples 2 and 3. Furthermore, for the bottom component where `max_color` is 7, the expected output removes only the *interface* 7s, not *all* 7s, contradicting the rule that worked for Example 3.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Modify the propagation rule for `max_color != 7`: Trigger propagation in all columns where a `max_color` interface cell is removed, removing the \"topmost\" requirement.\n2.  Keep the `max_color = 7` rule as is (remove all 7s, propagate in the median column), as it worked for Example 3.\n3.  Acknowledge that Example 1 follows a different pattern that is not yet captured by the current logic for either `max_color = 7` or `max_color != 7`. The current program will likely continue to fail on Example 1, but should now correctly handle Example 2 and Example 3. Further analysis would be needed to deduce the specific rules governing Example 1.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example | Component Colors | Max Color | Removal Rule Match (New Hypothesis) | Propagation Columns Match (New Hypothesis) | Overall Match (New Hypothesis) | Notes |\n| :------ | :--------------- | :-------- | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :---- |\n| 1 (Top) | {4, 6}           | 6         | No (Expected: Remove Interface 6s)  | No (Expected: Horizontal change)             | **No**                         | Rule appears different (horizontal?). |\n| 1 (Bot) | {3, 7}           | 7         | No (Expected: Remove Interface 7s)  | No (Expected: Horizontal change)             | **No**                         | Rule appears different.

Initialize the `output_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`.\n2.  Identify all distinct connected components of non-zero cells in the `input_grid` using 8-way adjacency. Keep track of the cells belonging to each component.\n3.  For each identified component:\n    a.  Determine the set of unique non-zero colors present.\n    b.  If the component contains only one unique non-zero color, skip to the next component.\n    c.  If the component contains multiple unique non-zero colors:\n        i.   Determine the maximum color value (`max_color`).\n        ii.  Initialize an empty set `propagation_columns`.\n        iii. **Removal Step:**\n            *   **Case 1: `max_color` is 7:**\n                1.  Identify all cells `(r, c)` within the component having color 7.\n                2.  Record the set of columns `removed_cols` containing these cells.\n                3.  In the `output_grid`, change the color of all these identified cells to 0.\n                4.  If `removed_cols` is not empty, sort the unique column indices in `removed_cols` and find the median column index (e.g., the element at index `floor(count / 2)`). Add this single median column to `propagation_columns`.\n            *   **Case 2: `max_color` is not 7:**\n                1.  Identify all interface cells within the component.\n                2.  Identify the subset of interface cells that have the `max_color` (`max_interface_cells`).\n                3.  For each `max_interface_cell` at `(r, c)`:\n                    a.  Add column `c` to `propagation_columns`.\n                    b.  In the `output_grid`, change the color of this cell `(r, c)` to 0.\n        iv. **Propagation Step:**\n            *   For each column `c` in `propagation_columns`:\n                1.  Find the minimum row index (`min_row_col`) occupied by *any* cell of the original component in column `c`.\n                2.  Starting from row `r_trace = min_row_col - 1` and moving upwards: Identify the contiguous block of cells `(r, c)` where `r <= r_trace` that have color 0 in the *input_grid*.\n                3.  In the `output_grid`, change the color of all cells in this identified block to `max_color`.\n4.  Return the `output_grid`.\n\n*Note:* This program is designed to handle the patterns observed in Training Examples 2 and 3. It is expected to fail on Training Example 1, which appears to follow a distinct transformation rule involving different removal logic for `max_color=7` and potentially horizontal propagation/modification."
