## Perception of Elements

The task involves transforming grids containing different non-zero integers (colors) on a zero background. The transformation operates on connected components of non-zero cells.

1.  **Objects:** The primary objects are connected components (using 8-way adjacency, i.e., edges or corners) of non-zero cells. These components can be composed of a single color or multiple colors.
2.  **Properties:** Each cell has a color (integer value). Components have properties like the set of colors they contain, their minimum color (`min_color`), their maximum color (`max_color`), and their spatial extent (bounding box, boundary cells). The interface between different colors within a component is a key property.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation only affects components containing *more than one* distinct non-zero color. Single-color components remain unchanged.
4.  **Core Logic:** The interaction between different colors within a component drives the change. The `max_color` generally "wins" or expands, while the `min_color` or interface cells are often removed.
5.  **Removal:** Cells are removed (changed to 0). This removal primarily targets cells involved in the interface between different colors. In some cases (like Train 3), *all* cells of the `max_color` are removed. In others (like Train 2), cells of *both* colors at the interface are removed.
6.  **Propagation/Conversion:** The `max_color` often appears in new locations. This can manifest as:
    *   **Upward Propagation:** Filling empty background (0) cells vertically above the original component, specifically in columns related to removed `max_color` cells (Train 2, Train 3). This propagation seems to target the highest contiguous block of 0s located immediately below the lowest non-zero cell in that column.
    *   **Conversion:** Changing existing `min_color` cells to `max_color` cells, particularly those not directly adjacent to the original `max_color` cells (Train 1 Bottom).
    *   **Horizontal Propagation:** Filling adjacent background cells horizontally (Train 1 Top - though this seems anomalous or requires a different interpretation).

7.  **Variability:** The exact rules for removal (all max vs. interface) and propagation/conversion (upward block vs. single cell vs. conversion vs. horizontal) appear to differ between examples, possibly depending on the specific colors involved, their relative values, or the geometric configuration of the component. The most consistent pattern involves removing interface cells and upward propagation of the `max_color` into the empty block below the component's top edge in relevant columns.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct connected components of non-zero cells in the input grid using 8-way adjacency.
3.  For each identified component:
    a.  Determine the set of unique non-zero colors present in the component.
    b.  If the component contains only one unique non-zero color, leave it unchanged in the output grid.
    c.  If the component contains multiple unique non-zero colors:
        i.  Find the minimum color value (`min_color`) and the maximum color value (`max_color`) present in the component.
        ii. Identify all "interface cells" within this component: these are cells that are adjacent (8-way) to at least one other cell *within the same component* that has a *different non-zero color*. Keep track of the original color of these interface cells.
        iii. Identify the subset of interface cells that originally had the `max_color` (`interface_max_cells`). Record the columns where these cells are located.
        iv. **Removal Step:** In the output grid, change the color of *all* identified interface cells (regardless of their original color) to 0 (background).
        v. **Propagation Step:** For each column `c` that contained at least one `interface_max_cell`:
            1.  Find the minimum row index (`min_row_col`) occupied by *any* non-zero cell of the original component in that column `c`.
            2.  Starting from row `r = min_row_col - 1` and going upwards (decreasing `r`): Find the contiguous block of cells `(r, c)` that have a color of 0 in the *input* grid.
            3.  If such a block exists directly below `min_row_col`, change the color of all cells in this block to `max_color` in the *output* grid.
4.  Return the modified output grid.

*Self-Correction/Refinement during thought process:* Initial hypotheses involving removing only max-color cells, or converting min-color cells, or different propagation rules (single cell, horizontal) were considered. The chosen program (based primarily on Train 2 Top) involves removing *all* interface cells and propagating the max color into the empty block just below the component's minimum row in relevant columns. This seems to be the most frequent pattern, although it doesn't perfectly replicate every detail of all examples (specifically Train 1 variations, Train 2 Middle's single-cell propagation, and Train 3's 'remove all max' behavior). It represents a plausible generalization capturing key aspects of the transformation.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code, based on removing all interface cells and propagating the max color upwards, failed on all examples. The results show significant discrepancies, indicating the removal and propagation rules were incorrect or incomplete.

*   **Example 1 Failure:** The code removed too many cells (all interface cells, not just max color ones) and performed vertical propagation instead of the observed horizontal changes.
*   **Example 2 Failure:** The code removed too many cells (all interface). While vertical propagation occurred, the specific columns and removal logic were wrong according to the initial code's implementation (removing *all* interface cells).
*   **Example 3 Failure:** The code removed only interface cells, while the expected output removed *all* cells of the max color (7). The propagation columns were also incorrect.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Removal Rule:** Differentiate between cases. It appears that only `max_color` interface cells are typically removed (Rule A), but if `max_color` is 7, *all* 7s are removed (Rule B).
2.  **Refine Propagation Rule:** Vertical upward propagation into the block of zeros below the component's top seems common (Examples 2 & 3). The *trigger* for which columns get propagated needs refinement.
    *   For Rule A (max_color != 7): Propagation seems tied to columns where the *topmost* cell of the component was a removed `max_color` interface cell.
    *   For Rule B (max_color == 7): Propagation seems to occur only in the *median* column among those where 7s were removed.
3.  **Address Example 1 Anomaly:** Example 1 shows horizontal changes rather than vertical propagation. This might be a distinct rule possibly related to component shape or specific color pairs, or it might involve converting adjacent background cells rather than propagating into blocks. Given its difference, the primary focus will be on creating a rule for Examples 2 and 3, acknowledging that Example 1 may follow a different pattern.

| Example | Component Colors | Max Color | Removal Rule Match (New Hypothesis) | Propagation Columns Match (New Hypothesis) | Overall Match (New Hypothesis) | Notes |

| 1 (Bot) | {3, 7}           | 7         | No (Expected: Remove Interface 7s)  | No (Expected: Horizontal change)             | **No**                         | Rule seems entirely different (horizontal?). Special case 7 doesn't apply as expected. |
| 2       | {3, 6, 9}        | 9         | Yes (Remove Interface 9s)           | Yes (Cols 2, 7 - Topmost interface 9s)       | **Yes**                        | Matches Rule A + Topmost trigger. |
| 3       | {6, 7}           | 7         | Yes (Remove all 7s)                 | Yes (Col 5 - Median column)                  | **Yes**                        | Matches Rule B + Median trigger. |

anomalies:
  - anomaly: Example 1 shows horizontal modification/propagation rather than the vertical propagation observed in Examples 2 and 3. The removal rule also seems different (removing interface 7s, not all 7s). This suggests Example 1 might follow a distinct transformation rule not covered by the primary logic derived from Examples 2 and 3.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Identify all distinct connected components of non-zero cells in the `input_grid` using 8-way adjacency. Keep track of the cells belonging to each component.
3.  For each identified component:
    a.  Determine the set of unique non-zero colors present.
    b.  If the component contains only one unique non-zero color, skip to the next component.
    c.  If the component contains multiple unique non-zero colors:
        i.   Determine the maximum color value (`max_color`).
        ii.  Initialize an empty set `propagation_columns`.
        iii. **Removal Step:**
            *   **Case 1: `max_color` is 7:**
                1.  Identify all cells `(r, c)` within the component having color 7.
                2.  Record the set of columns `removed_cols` containing these cells.
                3.  In the `output_grid`, change the color of all these identified cells to 0.
                4.  If `removed_cols` is not empty, sort the unique column indices in `removed_cols` and find the median column index (e.g., the element at index `floor(count / 2)`). Add this single median column to `propagation_columns`.
            *   **Case 2: `max_color` is not 7:**
                1.  Identify all interface cells within the component.
                2.  Identify the subset of interface cells that have the `max_color` (`max_interface_cells`).
                3.  For each `max_interface_cell` at `(r, c)`:
                    a.  Check if this cell `(r, c)` is the topmost cell of the component in column `c` (i.e., no other component cell `(r', c)` exists with `r' < r`).
                    b.  If it is the topmost, add column `c` to `propagation_columns`.
                    c.  In the `output_grid`, change the color of this cell `(r, c)` to 0.
        iv. **Propagation Step:**
            *   For each column `c` in `propagation_columns`:
                1.  Find the minimum row index (`min_row_col`) occupied by *any* cell of the original component in column `c`.
                2.  Starting from row `r_trace = min_row_col - 1` and moving upwards: Identify the contiguous block of cells `(r, c)` where `r <= r_trace` that have color 0 in the *input_grid*.
                3.  In the `output_grid`, change the color of all cells in this identified block to `max_color`.
4.  Return the `output_grid`.

"""
Transforms an input grid based on interactions within multi-color connected components.

1. Identifies connected components (8-way adjacency) of non-zero cells.
2. For components with multiple distinct non-zero colors:
    a. Determines the maximum color (`max_color`).
    b. **Removal Logic:**
        i. If `max_color` is 7: Removes *all* cells with color 7 within the component.
        ii. If `max_color` is not 7: Finds interface cells (adjacent to a different non-zero color within the component) and removes only those interface cells that have the `max_color`.
    c. **Propagation Column Identification Logic:**
        i. If `max_color` was 7: Identifies the median column among all columns where a 7 was removed.
        ii. If `max_color` was not 7: Identifies columns where a removed `max_color` interface cell was the topmost cell of the component in that specific column.
    d. **Propagation Logic:** For each identified propagation column, finds the minimum row (`min_row_col`) the component occupied in that column. Then, fills the contiguous block of background (0) cells located directly above this position (ending at `min_row_col - 1`) with the `max_color`.
3. Components with only one non-zero color are left unchanged.
4. The transformation primarily models the behavior seen in Training Examples 2 and 3, acknowledging that Example 1 might follow a different rule.
