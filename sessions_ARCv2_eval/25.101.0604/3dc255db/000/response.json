The transformation operates on connected components of non-zero cells.\n\n1.  **Objects:** The primary objects are connected components (using 8-way adjacency, i.e., edges or corners) of non-zero cells. These components can be composed of a single color or multiple colors.\n2.  **Properties:** Each cell has a color (integer value). Components have properties like the set of colors they contain, their minimum color (`min_color`), their maximum color (`max_color`), and their spatial extent (bounding box, boundary cells). The interface between different colors within a component is a key property.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation only affects components containing *more than one* distinct non-zero color. Single-color components remain unchanged.\n4.  **Core Logic:** The interaction between different colors within a component drives the change. The `max_color` generally \"wins\" or expands, while the `min_color` or interface cells are often removed.\n5.  **Removal:** Cells are removed (changed to 0). This removal primarily targets cells involved in the interface between different colors. In some cases (like Train 3), *all* cells of the `max_color` are removed. In others (like Train 2), cells of *both* colors at the interface are removed.\n6.  **Propagation/Conversion:** The `max_color` often appears in new locations. This can manifest as:\n    *   **Upward Propagation:** Filling empty background (0) cells vertically above the original component, specifically in columns related to removed `max_color` cells (Train 2, Train 3). This propagation seems to target the highest contiguous block of 0s located immediately below the lowest non-zero cell in that column.\n    *   **Conversion:** Changing existing `min_color` cells to `max_color` cells, particularly those not directly adjacent to the original `max_color` cells (Train 1 Bottom).\n    *   **Horizontal Propagation:** Filling adjacent background cells horizontally (Train 1 Top - though this seems anomalous or requires a different interpretation).\n\n7.  **Variability:** The exact rules for removal (all max vs. interface) and propagation/conversion (upward block vs. single cell vs. conversion vs. horizontal) appear to differ between examples, possibly depending on the specific colors involved, their relative values, or the geometric configuration of the component. The most consistent pattern involves removing interface cells and upward propagation of the `max_color` into the empty block below the component's top edge in relevant columns.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n```yaml\nelements:\n  - element: grid\n    properties:\n      - width: integer\n      - height: integer\n      - cells: list of lists of integers (colors)\n      - background_color: 0\n  - element: cell\n    properties:\n      - row: integer\n      - column: integer\n      - color: integer (0 for background, non-zero otherwise)\n  - element: component\n    description: A connected group of non-zero cells (8-way adjacency)\n    properties:\n      - cells: list of cell objects\n      - colors: set of unique non-zero integers present\n      - num_colors: count of unique non-zero colors\n      - min_color: minimum color value in the component\n      - max_color: maximum color value in the component\n      - interface_cells: subset of cells adjacent (8-way) to another cell in the component with a different non-zero color\n      - min_row: minimum row index occupied by the component\n\nactions:\n  - action: identify_components\n    description: Find all connected components of non-zero cells in the input grid.\n  - action: filter_components\n    description: Select components with more than one unique non-zero color.\n  - action: identify_interface_cells\n    description: For a multi-color component, find all cells adjacent (8-way) to a cell of a different non-zero color within the same component.\n  - action: remove_cells\n    description: Change the color of specified cells to the background color (0).\n    variants:\n      - remove_interface_cells: Remove all cells identified as interface_cells.\n      # - remove_max_color_cells: Remove all cells with max_color in the component.

Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2.  Identify all distinct connected components of non-zero cells in the input grid using 8-way adjacency.\n3.  For each identified component:\n    a.  Determine the set of unique non-zero colors present in the component.\n    b.  If the component contains only one unique non-zero color, leave it unchanged in the output grid.\n    c.  If the component contains multiple unique non-zero colors:\n        i.  Find the minimum color value (`min_color`) and the maximum color value (`max_color`) present in the component.\n        ii. Identify all \"interface cells\" within this component: these are cells that are adjacent (8-way) to at least one other cell *within the same component* that has a *different non-zero color*. Keep track of the original color of these interface cells.\n        iii. Identify the subset of interface cells that originally had the `max_color` (`interface_max_cells`). Record the columns where these cells are located.\n        iv. **Removal Step:** In the output grid, change the color of *all* identified interface cells (regardless of their original color) to 0 (background).\n        v. **Propagation Step:** For each column `c` that contained at least one `interface_max_cell`:\n            1.  Find the minimum row index (`min_row_col`) occupied by *any* non-zero cell of the original component in that column `c`.\n            2.  Starting from row `r = min_row_col - 1` and going upwards (decreasing `r`): Find the contiguous block of cells `(r, c)` that have a color of 0 in the *input* grid.\n            3.  If such a block exists directly below `min_row_col`, change the color of all cells in this block to `max_color` in the *output* grid.\n4.  Return the modified output grid.\n\n*Self-Correction/Refinement during thought process:* Initial hypotheses involving removing only max-color cells, or converting min-color cells, or different propagation rules (single cell, horizontal) were considered. The chosen program (based primarily on Train 2 Top) involves removing *all* interface cells and propagating the max color into the empty block just below the component's minimum row in relevant columns. This seems to be the most frequent pattern, although it doesn't perfectly replicate every detail of all examples (specifically Train 1 variations, Train 2 Middle's single-cell propagation, and Train 3's 'remove all max' behavior). It represents a plausible generalization capturing key aspects of the transformation."
