elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - width: integer
      - height: integer
      - cells: list of lists of integers (colors)
      - background_color: 0
  - element: cell
    properties:
      - row: integer
      - column: integer
      - color: integer (0 for background, non-zero otherwise)
  - element: component
    description: A connected group of non-zero cells (8-way adjacency)
    properties:
      - cells: list of cell objects
      - colors: set of unique non-zero integers present
      - num_colors: count of unique non-zero colors
      - min_color: minimum color value in the component
      - max_color: maximum color value in the component
      - interface_cells: subset of cells adjacent (8-way) to another cell in the component with a different non-zero color
      - min_row: minimum row index occupied by the component

actions:
  - action: identify_components
    description: Find all connected components of non-zero cells in the input grid.
  - action: filter_components
    description: Select components with more than one unique non-zero color.
  - action: identify_interface_cells
    description: For a multi-color component, find all cells adjacent (8-way) to a cell of a different non-zero color within the same component.
  - action: remove_cells
    description: Change the color of specified cells to the background color (0).
    variants:
      - remove_interface_cells: Remove all cells identified as interface_cells.
      # - remove_max_color_cells: Remove all cells with max_color in the component. (Alternative rule seen in Train 3)
      # - remove_interface_max_cells: Remove only interface cells with max_color. (Alternative rule seen in Train 1)
  - action: propagate_color
    description: Fill certain background cells (0) with the max_color.
    variants:
      - propagate_upwards_block: >
          For columns containing removed max_color interface cells,
          find the lowest row occupied by the component in that column (min_row_col).
          Identify the contiguous block of background cells (0) ending just below min_row_col.
          Fill this block with max_color. ( Matches Train 2 Top, Train 3 if combined with different removal)
      # - propagate_upwards_single: >
      #     For columns containing removed max_color interface cells,
      #     find the lowest row occupied by the component in that column (min_row_col).
      #     If the cell directly below min_row_col is background(0), fill it with max_color. (Matches Train 2 Middle)
      # - convert_min_to_max: >
      #     Find min_color cells not adjacent to any original max_color cells and change them to max_color. (Matches Train 1 Bottom)

relationships:
  - relationship: adjacency
    description: Cells sharing an edge or corner (8-way).
  - relationship: within_component
    description: A cell belongs to a specific connected component.
  - relationship: color_interface
    description: A cell is adjacent to another cell within the same component, but they have different non-zero colors.
