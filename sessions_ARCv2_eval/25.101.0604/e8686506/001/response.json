Determine the background color by finding the most frequent pixel value in the input grid.\n2. Identify all distinct connected groups (objects) of pixels that are not the background color, \n   considering pixels connected orthogonally or diagonally.\n3. For each object, find the smallest rectangular bounding box that contains it.\n4. Calculate the area (height * width) of each object's bounding box.\n5. Find the maximum area calculated in the previous step.\n6. Identify all objects whose bounding box area equals this maximum area.\n7. Determine the overall bounding box that minimally encloses *all* the objects identified in step 6. \n   This combined bounding box defines the shape and top-left reference point for the output grid.\n8. Create a new grid with the dimensions derived from the combined bounding box.\n9. Iterate through each position within this combined bounding box relative to the input grid.\n10. If the pixel at the current position in the input grid is *not* the background color, \n    copy its value to the corresponding position in the output grid.\n11. If the pixel at the current position in the input grid *is* the background color, \n    determine its value in the output grid by finding the color of the closest non-background pixel \n    located anywhere in the original input grid (using Euclidean distance, \n    breaking ties by lowest color value then lowest row index, then lowest column index). \n    Place this determined color in the corresponding position in the output grid.\n12.
