## Initial Perception

The input is an 8x8 grid of integers. The output is a 16x4 grid of integers.
The input grid appears structured into four distinct 4x4 quadrants.
- Top-left: Uniform value (1).
- Top-right: Contains two values (3, 0).
- Bottom-left: Uniform value (5).
- Bottom-right: Contains two values (6, 0) arranged in a checkerboard pattern.

The output grid contains only two values (5, 6) arranged in a checkerboard pattern. The dimensions suggest a transformation that reshapes and possibly combines information from the input quadrants. The values in the output (5 and 6) are directly present in the bottom half of the input grid. Specifically, 6 comes from the bottom-right quadrant, and 5 comes from the bottom-left quadrant. The 0s in the input's bottom-right quadrant seem to be replaced by the 5 from the bottom-left quadrant. The resulting 4x4 pattern from the bottom-right (with 0s replaced by 5s) appears to be tiled vertically to form the 16x4 output.

## Observed Facts (YAML)


```yaml
observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - dimensions: 8x8
      - contains_integers: true
      - structure: composed of four 4x4 quadrants
    quadrants:
      - name: top_left
        position: rows 0-3, cols 0-3
        content: uniform value 1
      - name: top_right
        position: rows 0-3, cols 4-7
        content: values 3 and 0
      - name: bottom_left
        position: rows 4-7, cols 0-3
        content: uniform value 5
      - name: bottom_right
        position: rows 4-7, cols 4-7
        content: values 6 and 0 in a checkerboard pattern
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - dimensions: 16x4
      - contains_integers: true
      - content: values 5 and 6 in a checkerboard pattern
  - relationship: input_to_output
    rule:
      - The values 5 and 6 in the output originate from the bottom_left and bottom_right input quadrants, respectively.
      - The pattern in the output appears derived from the bottom_right input quadrant.
      - The 0s in the bottom_right input quadrant are replaced by the value from the bottom_left input quadrant (5).
      - This modified 4x4 pattern from the bottom_right quadrant is used as a tile.
      - The output grid dimensions (16x4) suggest the 4x4 tile is repeated vertically.
    transformation_details:
      - source_pattern_quadrant: bottom_right
      - fill_value_quadrant: bottom_left
      - fill_value: 5
      - target_value_to_replace: 0
      - base_tile_dimensions: 4x4 (derived from modified bottom_right quadrant)
      - output_height_calculation: base_tile_height (4) * base_tile_height (4) = 16
      - output_width_calculation: base_tile_width (4) = 4
      - construction_method: Vertical tiling of the 4x4 base tile.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Divide** the 8x8 input grid into four equal 4x4 quadrants: top-left (Q1), top-right (Q2), bottom-left (Q3), and bottom-right (Q4).
2.  **Identify** the single constant numerical value within the bottom-left quadrant (Q3). Call this the `fill_value`.
3.  **Identify** the 4x4 pattern within the bottom-right quadrant (Q4). Call this the `template_pattern`.
4.  **Create** a new 4x4 grid, the `base_output_pattern`, by iterating through the `template_pattern`. For each cell, if the value is 0, replace it with the `fill_value`; otherwise, keep the original value.
5.  **Determine** the output grid dimensions. The width is the width of the `base_output_pattern` (4). The height is the square of the height of the `base_output_pattern` (4 * 4 = 16).
6.  **Construct** the final 16x4 output grid by vertically stacking copies of the `base_output_pattern` until the target height (16) is reached (i.e., stack it 4 times).
