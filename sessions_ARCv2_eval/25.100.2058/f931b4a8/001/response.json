            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the new example (`train_2`) and integrate the findings with the previous analysis of `train_1` to refine the understanding of the transformation rule.\n\n## Refined Perception\n\nThe input is consistently an 8x8 grid of integers, structurally divided into four 4x4 quadrants. The output grid's dimensions vary: 16x4 in the first example, 16x16 in the second. This variation suggests the output size isn't fixed but depends on input characteristics.\n\nThe core transformation still appears to involve the bottom two quadrants of the input: bottom-left (Q3) and bottom-right (Q4). Q4 serves as a template, while Q3 provides values to fill in the '0' entries within Q4. Specifically, a '0' at position `(r, c)` within Q4 seems to be replaced by the value present in row `r` of Q3. This generates a 4x4 `core_pattern`.\n\nThe crucial difference lies in how this `core_pattern` is used to construct the output. The output is formed by tiling the `core_pattern`. The number of vertical tiles seems consistently related to the height of the `core_pattern` (4 tiles for a 4x4 pattern, resulting in 16 rows). The number of horizontal tiles appears to depend on the content of Q3: if Q3 contains only one distinct value (uniform, as in `train_1`), the `core_pattern` is used only once horizontally (`tile_cols = 1`, output width 4). If Q3 contains multiple distinct values (row variation, as in `train_2`), the `core_pattern` is tiled horizontally as many times as its width (`tile_cols = 4`, output width 16).\n\nThe top two quadrants (Q1 and Q2) still seem irrelevant to the output's content or structure based on these two examples.\n\n## Updated Observed Facts (YAML)\n\n"
