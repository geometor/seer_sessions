            "text": "**Refined Perception:**\n\nBased on the three examples, the core task involves identifying rectangular, two-row high \"objects\" composed of digits other than '8' within a central subgrid of the input. The background digit '8' is used for padding in the output and is ignored when identifying objects. The first few columns (index 0, 1) and the last column of the input appear to be border/padding and are ignored. The first one or two rows might also be header/ignored.\n\nTwo distinct transformation strategies seem to exist:\n\n1.  **Stacking Strategy (Observed in `train_2`, `train_3`):** All identified 2-row high object *instances* are extracted. The maximum width among these objects determines the output width. Each object is then represented in the output, centered horizontally within the maximum width (padded with '8's), and stacked vertically in the order they appear in the input (top-to-bottom, left-to-right). The output dimensions are dynamic (`2 * num_objects` rows, `max_object_width` columns). This strategy seems applicable when the input objects are relatively simple and clearly separated.\n\n2.  **Composition Strategy (Observed in `train_1`):** Specific *types* of 2-row high objects found in the input trigger placement and potential transformation onto a *fixed-size* output canvas (12x6 in `train_1`). The output is constructed based on a predefined layout rule, potentially combining elements from different object types, applying transformations (like transposition/rotation), and filling unspecified areas with '8'. This strategy seems applicable for inputs with more complex pattern arrangements or specific object types requiring transformation/combination.\n\nThe determining factor between these two strategies is not yet fully clear but might relate to input grid dimensions (e.g., taller inputs like `train_1` use Composition) or the presence of specific complex/asymmetric object types (like `[[1,6],[2,6]]` or `[[4,7],[7,4]]` in `train_1`).\n\n**Updated YAML Facts:**\n\n"
