**Refined Perception:**

Based on the three examples, the core task involves identifying rectangular, two-row high "objects" composed of digits other than '8' within a central subgrid of the input. The background digit '8' is used for padding in the output and is ignored when identifying objects. The first few columns (index 0, 1) and the last column of the input appear to be border/padding and are ignored. The first one or two rows might also be header/ignored.

Two distinct transformation strategies seem to exist:

1.  **Stacking Strategy (Observed in `train_2`, `train_3`):** All identified 2-row high object *instances* are extracted. The maximum width among these objects determines the output width. Each object is then represented in the output, centered horizontally within the maximum width (padded with '8's), and stacked vertically in the order they appear in the input (top-to-bottom, left-to-right). The output dimensions are dynamic (`2 * num_objects` rows, `max_object_width` columns). This strategy seems applicable when the input objects are relatively simple and clearly separated.

2.  **Composition Strategy (Observed in `train_1`):** Specific *types* of 2-row high objects found in the input trigger placement and potential transformation onto a *fixed-size* output canvas (12x6 in `train_1`). The output is constructed based on a predefined layout rule, potentially combining elements from different object types, applying transformations (like transposition/rotation), and filling unspecified areas with '8'. This strategy seems applicable for inputs with more complex pattern arrangements or specific object types requiring transformation/combination.

The determining factor between these two strategies is not yet fully clear but might relate to input grid dimensions (e.g., taller inputs like `train_1` use Composition) or the presence of specific complex/asymmetric object types (like `[[1,6],[2,6]]` or `[[4,7],[7,4]]` in `train_1`).

**Updated YAML Facts:**


```yaml
common_properties:
  background_digit: 8
  object_height: 2 # Key patterns/objects are consistently 2 rows high.
  ignored_input_columns: [0, 1, -1] # First, second, and last columns.
  ignored_input_rows: [0, 1] # First two rows seem consistently non-data.
  object_definition: Connected components of non-background digits, exactly 2 rows high, within the core input area.

transformation_strategies:
  - strategy_name: Stacking
    observed_in: [train_2, train_3]
    trigger_conditions: Potentially shorter input grids (e.g., <= 8 rows?), absence of specific complex patterns.
    input_processing: Identify all object *instances*.
    output_construction:
      - Determine max object width (`W`).
      - Output dimensions: `(2 * num_objects) x W`.
      - For each object instance (in input order):
        - Center its pattern horizontally in width `W`, padding with background_digit.
        - Append the resulting 2 rows to the output.
  - strategy_name: Composition
    observed_in: [train_1]
    trigger_conditions: Potentially taller input grids (e.g., > 8 rows?), presence of specific complex patterns (e.g., `[[1,6],[2,6]]`, `[[4,7],[7,4]]`).
    input_processing: Identify object *types* present.
    output_construction:
      - Target output grid has fixed dimensions (e.g., 12x6 for train_1).
      - A predefined layout maps specific input object types to specific locations and patterns in the output grid.
      - May involve transformations (e.g., transposition) or combining parts of different objects.
      - Unspecified cells filled with background_digit.

**Updated Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Define Constants:** Set the background digit (assumed '8'). Define ignored input rows (e.g., 0, 1) and columns (e.g., 0, 1, last).
2.  **Isolate Core Input:** Extract the subgrid from the input by removing the ignored rows and columns.
3.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the core input subgrid row by row, then column by column. Identify all connected components of non-background digits that span exactly two rows. Store each unique object found, recording its pattern (grid of digits) and its dimensions (width).
4.  **Determine Strategy:** Analyze the input grid's properties (e.g., dimensions) and the characteristics of the identified objects.
    *   **Hypothesis:** If the input grid height is large (e.g., > 8 rows) OR if specific complex/asymmetric patterns like `[[1,6],[2,6]]` or `[[4,7],[7,4]]` are present, select the **Composition Strategy**.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Otherwise, select the **Stacking Strategy**.
5.  **Execute Strategy:**
    *   **If Stacking Strategy:**
        a.  Collect all identified object *instances* in the order they were found (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
        b.  Calculate the maximum width (`max_width`) among all collected object instances.
        c.  Initialize an empty output grid.
        d.  For each object instance:
            i.  Determine the necessary left/right padding with the background digit to center the object's pattern within `max_width`.
            ii. Create the two padded rows for this object.
            iii. Append these two rows to the output grid.
    *   **If Composition Strategy (Example based on `train_1`):**
        a.  Identify the *types* of objects present in the input (e.g., `T_44`, `T_99`, `T_12_66`, `T_66`, `T_4774`, `T_77`, `T_33`).
        b.  Initialize a fixed-size output grid (e.g., 12x6 for `train_1`) filled with the background digit.
        c.  Apply a predefined set of rules to populate the output grid based on the presence of object types:
            *   If `T_44` exists, place `[[4,4],[4,4]]` at rows 1-2, cols 3-4 AND rows 9-10, cols 3-4.
            *   If `T_99` exists, place `[[9,9],[9,9]]` at rows 7-8, cols 3-4.
            *   If `T_12_66` exists, place `[[1],[2]]` at rows 3-4, col 1.
            *   If `T_12_66` or `T_66` exists, fill rows 3-4, cols 2-5 with `6`.
            *   If `T_66` exists, place `[[6,6]]` (top row of `T_66`) at row 5, cols 2-3.
            *   If `T_33` exists, place `[[3,3]]` at row 5, cols 4-5 AND at row 6, cols 2-3 AND at row 6, cols 4-5.
            *   If `T_4774` exists, place its transformed pattern `[[7,4],[4,7]]` at rows 11-12, cols 1-2.
            *   If `T_77` exists, fill rows 11-12, cols 3-5 with `7`.
            *   (Note: This composition logic is specific to `train_1` and may need generalization if more examples of this type appear).
6.  **Return Output:** Return the final constructed output grid.
