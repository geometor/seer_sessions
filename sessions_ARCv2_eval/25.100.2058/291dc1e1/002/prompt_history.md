Okay, let's break down the transformation based on this first example.

**Initial Perception:**

The input is a 20x8 grid of single digits. The output is a smaller 12x6 grid. The numbers appear to represent colors or categories in a pixel-like grid. The transformation seems to involve extracting specific, smaller patterns or "objects" from a central region of the input grid and arranging them into the output grid. The number '8' appears frequently in both input and output, possibly acting as a background or default color. The core task seems to be recognizing certain 2-row high patterns (mostly 2x2 blocks, but also some 2x1 or mixed blocks) within columns 2-7 of the input and then assembling these recognized patterns into the fixed-size output grid, potentially combining or overlaying them.

**Observed Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: [20, 8]
  value_range: 0-9
  structure: 2D grid of integers
  features:
    - Column 0: Mostly '1', first row is '0'.
    - Column 1: Mostly '8'.
    - Columns 2-7: Contain various numerical patterns, often in 2-row high configurations, embedded within regions of '8'.
    - Notable patterns (within cols 2-7):
      - Pairs of identical rows exist (e.g., rows 2-3, 8-9, 12-13, 16-17).
      - Specific 2-row structures observed:
        - `[[4, 4], [4, 4]]` (multiple locations)
        - `[[9, 9], [9, 9]]`
        - `[[6, 6], [6, 6]]` (multiple locations)
        - `[[7, 7], [7, 7]]` (multiple locations)
        - `[[3, 3], [3, 3]]`
        - `[[1], [2]]` (vertical pair in col 2)
        - `[[4, 7], [7, 4]]` (diagonal pair)
output_grid:
  dimensions: [12, 6]
  value_range: 1-9 (0 is absent)
  structure: 2D grid of integers
  features:
    - Contains rearranged/combined patterns from the input's central columns.
    - '8' appears as a frequent background/padding value.
    - Specific patterns from input are present:
      - `4 4` block appears twice.
      - `9 9` block appears once.
    - Composite patterns are present:
      - Rows 3-4 combine `1 2` and `6 6`.
      - Rows 5-6 combine `6 6` and `3 3`.
      - Rows 11-12 combine `4 7`/`7 4` and `7 7`.
relationship:
  - The output grid seems derived from the input grid's columns 2 through 7.
  - Specific 2-row high patterns are extracted from the input.
  - These patterns are placed, sometimes combined, into a fixed 12x6 output layout.
  - The background value '8' fills unspecified areas in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program (Based on this example only):**

1.  **Focus:** Isolate the central 6 columns (columns 2 through 7) of the 20-row input grid.
2.  **Identify Patterns:** Scan this 20x6 subgrid to find all occurrences of the following specific 2-row high patterns:
    *   `P_44`: A 2x2 block of `4`.
    *   `P_99`: A 2x2 block of `9`.
    *   `P_66`: A 2x2 block of `6`.
    *   `P_77`: A 2x2 block of `7`.
    *   `P_33`: A 2x2 block of `3`.
    *   `P_12`: A 2x1 block with `1` above `2`.
    *   `P_4774`: A 2x2 block with `4` top-left, `7` top-right, `7` bottom-left, `4` bottom-right.
3.  **Construct Output:** Create a new 12x6 grid.
4.  **Populate Output:** Fill the output grid according to the following specific layout, using the patterns identified in step 2 and filling remaining cells with '8':
    *   Rows 1-2: Place `P_44` centered horizontally (`8 8 4 4 8 8`).
    *   Rows 7-8: Place `P_99` centered horizontally (`8 8 9 9 8 8`).
    *   Rows 9-10: Place `P_44` centered horizontally (`8 8 4 4 8 8`).
    *   Row 3: Fill with `6`.
    *   Row 4: Place `P_12` at columns 1-2, fill remaining columns 3-6 with `6`. (`1 2 6 6 6 6`).
    *   Row 5: Place `P_66` at columns 2-3, place `P_33` at columns 4-5. Fill remaining with `8`. (`8 6 6 3 3 8`).
    *   Row 6: Place `P_33` twice, at columns 2-3 and 4-5. Fill remaining with `8`. (`8 3 3 3 3 8`).
    *   Row 11: Place the top row of `P_4774` (`4 7`) at columns 1-2, fill remaining columns 3-6 with `7`. (`7 4 7 7 7 7`). Note: The first '7' seems to come from P_4774 or P_77. Let's refine: Row 11 is `[7, 4, 7, 7, 7, 7]`. Maybe derived from `P_4774`'s `[4, 7]` and `P_77`.
    *   Row 12: Place the bottom row of `P_4774` (`7 4`) at columns 1-2, fill remaining columns 3-6 with `7`. (`4 7 7 7 7 7`). Let's refine: Row 12 is `[4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]`. Maybe derived from `P_4774`'s `[7, 4]` and `P_77`.
    *   Refined step for Rows 11-12: Place the `P_4774` pattern (specifically `[[4, 7], [7, 4]]`) at columns 1-2 (`[[?, 4, ?, ...], [?, 7, ?, ...]]`) and overlay/fill the rest with `7`s derived from `P_77`. Output: `[[7, 4, 7, 7, 7, 7], [4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]]`. This seems inconsistent with the pattern definition. Let's re-examine P_4774: Input rows 10-11, cols 5-6 are `[[4, 7], [7, 4]]`. Output rows 11-12, cols 1-2 are `[[7, 4], [4, 7]]`. This looks like the pattern is transposed or rotated, or my pattern identification was slightly off. Let's adjust: Output rows 11-12, columns 1-2 use the `[[7, 4], [4, 7]]` block (which is the `P_4774` pattern found transposed?), and columns 3-6 are filled with `7` (from `P_7

## train_2

8 6 6 8
8 9 9 8
8 9 9 8
```

Okay, let's refine the analysis based on the new example (`train_2`).

**Refined Perception:**

The core task remains identifying significant patterns (or "objects") within a central region of the input grid, ignoring likely border/padding columns (like column 0, 1, and the last column) and potentially the first row. These objects consistently appear to be exactly two rows high. The primary background or padding digit is '8'.

The key difference highlighted by `train_2` is the *output construction mechanism*.

*   In `train_1`, the output seemed to be a fixed 12x6 canvas where specific identified input object *types* were placed, sometimes composed or transformed, into predefined locations.
*   In `train_2`, the output size (8x4) is directly determined by the identified objects. It seems to be a simple vertical stack of representations of *all* found objects, padded horizontally with '8's to match the width of the widest object found.

This suggests two potential modes of operation or two classes of problems: one involving complex, fixed-layout composition (`train_1`) and another involving simple, dynamic-layout stacking (`train_2`). The trigger for which mode to use might depend on the input structure or the types of objects found.

**Updated YAML Facts:**


```yaml
common_properties:
  background_digit: 8
  object_height: 2 # Key patterns/objects are consistently 2 rows high.
  border_columns_ignored: true # First column (index 0), second (index 1), and last column seem irrelevant.
  first_row_potentially_ignored: true # First row in train_1 (index 0) seems irrelevant.

example_train_1:
  input_grid:
    dimensions: [20, 8]
    value_range: 0-9
    core_area: Rows 1-19, Columns 2-7
    identified_objects_2rows_high:
      - pattern: [[4, 4], [4, 4]]
      - pattern: [[9, 9], [9, 9]]
      - pattern: [[1, 6], [2, 6]]
      - pattern: [[6, 6], [6, 6]] # Found multiple times
      - pattern: [[4, 7], [7, 4]]
      - pattern: [[7, 7], [7, 7]] # Found multiple times
      - pattern: [[3, 6], [3, 6]]
      - pattern: [[3, 3], [3, 3]]
  output_grid:
    dimensions: [12, 6]
    value_range: 1-9
    structure: Fixed layout composed from transformed/selected input objects.
    relationship: Complex mapping from input object types to specific output regions/patterns. Involves padding ('8'), potential transformation (rotation/transposition), and composition.

example_train_2:
  input_grid:
    dimensions: [8, 11]
    value_range: 0-9
    core_area: Rows 1-7, Columns 2-9
    identified_objects_2rows_high:
      - pattern: [[3, 3], [3, 3]]
      - pattern: [[4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4]]
      - pattern: [[6, 6], [6, 6]]
      - pattern: [[9, 9], [9, 9]]
  output_grid:
    dimensions: [8, 4]
    value_range: 3-9
    structure: Dynamic layout determined by identified objects.
    relationship: Simple stacking. Output width matches max object width. Each object is centered horizontally with '8' padding and placed vertically in order of detection.
```


**Updated Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Isolate Core:** Identify the relevant core subgrid of the input by excluding border rows/columns that primarily contain padding ('8') or indexing information (like the first column, second column, last column). Assume the background/padding digit is '8'.
2.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the core subgrid to detect all connected components (objects) of non-'8' digits that are exactly two rows high. Record the pattern (digit grid) for each object found.
3.  **Determine Output Strategy:** Analyze the set of identified objects and potentially the overall input structure to select the appropriate output generation strategy:
    *   **Strategy A (Stacking):** If the task follows the pattern observed in `train_2` (e.g., perhaps simpler object structures, or a specific input configuration), construct the output as follows:
        a.  Find the maximum width (`max_width`) among all identified objects.
        b.  Initialize an empty output grid. The number of rows will be `2 * number_of_objects`, and the number of columns will be `max_width`.
        c.  Iterate through the identified objects (e.g., in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order of their appearance in the input core).
        d.  For each object, create its 2x`max_width` representation by horizontally centering its pattern and padding with the background digit ('8') on the left/right as needed.
        e.  Append these two rows to the output grid.
    *   **Strategy B (Composition):** If the task follows the pattern observed in `train_1` (e.g., more complex object interactions, transformations required, or a specific input configuration), construct the output using a predefined mapping:
        a.  Initialize a fixed-size output grid (e.g., 12x6 for `train_1`).
        b.  Identify the *types* of objects found in the input (e.g., `[[4,4],[4,4]]`, `[[1,6],[2,6]]`, `[[4,7],[7,4]]`, etc.).
        c.  For each required output pattern/region, check if the corresponding input object type(s) were found.
        d.  If found, populate the target region in the output grid using the specified composition or transformation rule for that object type (e.g., place a padded `[[4,4],[4,4]]`, use the `[[1],[2]]` part of `[[1,6],[2,6]]`, use a transposed `[[4,7],[7,4]]`, combine parts of `[[6,6],[6,6]]` and `[[3,3],[3,3]]`).
        e.  Fill any remaining unspecified cells in the output grid with the background digit ('8').
4.  **Final Output:** Return the generated output grid.
