common_properties:
  background_digit: 8
  object_height: 2 # Key patterns/objects are consistently 2 rows high.
  border_columns_ignored: true # First column (index 0), second (index 1), and last column seem irrelevant.
  first_row_potentially_ignored: true # First row in train_1 (index 0) seems irrelevant.

example_train_1:
  input_grid:
    dimensions: [20, 8]
    value_range: 0-9
    core_area: Rows 1-19, Columns 2-7
    identified_objects_2rows_high:
      - pattern: [[4, 4], [4, 4]]
      - pattern: [[9, 9], [9, 9]]
      - pattern: [[1, 6], [2, 6]]
      - pattern: [[6, 6], [6, 6]] # Found multiple times
      - pattern: [[4, 7], [7, 4]]
      - pattern: [[7, 7], [7, 7]] # Found multiple times
      - pattern: [[3, 6], [3, 6]]
      - pattern: [[3, 3], [3, 3]]
  output_grid:
    dimensions: [12, 6]
    value_range: 1-9
    structure: Fixed layout composed from transformed/selected input objects.
    relationship: Complex mapping from input object types to specific output regions/patterns. Involves padding ('8'), potential transformation (rotation/transposition), and composition.

example_train_2:
  input_grid:
    dimensions: [8, 11]
    value_range: 0-9
    core_area: Rows 1-7, Columns 2-9
    identified_objects_2rows_high:
      - pattern: [[3, 3], [3, 3]]
      - pattern: [[4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4]]
      - pattern: [[6, 6], [6, 6]]
      - pattern: [[9, 9], [9, 9]]
  output_grid:
    dimensions: [8, 4]
    value_range: 3-9
    structure: Dynamic layout determined by identified objects.
    relationship: Simple stacking. Output width matches max object width. Each object is centered horizontally with '8' padding and placed vertically in order of detection.
