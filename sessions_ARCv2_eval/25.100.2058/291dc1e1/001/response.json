            "text": "Okay, let's refine the analysis based on the new example (`train_2`).\n\n**Refined Perception:**\n\nThe core task remains identifying significant patterns (or \"objects\") within a central region of the input grid, ignoring likely border/padding columns (like column 0, 1, and the last column) and potentially the first row. These objects consistently appear to be exactly two rows high. The primary background or padding digit is '8'.\n\nThe key difference highlighted by `train_2` is the *output construction mechanism*.\n\n*   In `train_1`, the output seemed to be a fixed 12x6 canvas where specific identified input object *types* were placed, sometimes composed or transformed, into predefined locations.\n*   In `train_2`, the output size (8x4) is directly determined by the identified objects. It seems to be a simple vertical stack of representations of *all* found objects, padded horizontally with '8's to match the width of the widest object found.\n\nThis suggests two potential modes of operation or two classes of problems: one involving complex, fixed-layout composition (`train_1`) and another involving simple, dynamic-layout stacking (`train_2`). The trigger for which mode to use might depend on the input structure or the types of objects found.\n\n**Updated YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Assume the background/padding digit is '8'.\n2.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the core subgrid to detect all connected components (objects) of non-'8' digits that are exactly two rows high. Record the pattern (digit grid) for each object found.\n3.  **Determine Output Strategy:** Analyze the set of identified objects and potentially the overall input structure to select the appropriate output generation strategy:\n    *   **Strategy A (Stacking):** If the task follows the pattern observed in `train_2` (e.g., perhaps simpler object structures, or a specific input configuration), construct the output as follows:\n        a.  Find the maximum width (`max_width`) among all identified objects.\n        b.  Initialize an empty output grid. The number of rows will be `2 * number_of_objects`, and the number of columns will be `max_width`.\n        c.  Iterate through the identified objects (e.g., in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order of their appearance in the input core).\n        d.  For each object, create its 2x`max_width` representation by horizontally centering its pattern and padding with the background digit ('8') on the left/right as needed.\n        e.  Append these two rows to the output grid.\n    *   **Strategy B (Composition):** If the task follows the pattern observed in `train_1` (e.g., more complex object interactions, transformations required, or a specific input configuration), construct the output using a predefined mapping:\n        a.  Initialize a fixed-size output grid (e.g., 12x6 for `train_1`).\n        b.  Identify the *types* of objects found in the input (e.g., `[[4,4],[4,4]]`, `[[1,6],[2,6]]`, `[[4,7],[7,4]]`, etc.).\n        c.  For each required output pattern/region, check if the corresponding input object type(s) were found.\n        d.  If found, populate the target region in the output grid using the specified composition or transformation rule for that object type (e.g., place a padded `[[4,4],[4,4]]`, use the `[[1],[2]]` part of `[[1,6],[2,6]]`, use a transposed `[[4,7],[7,4]]`, combine parts of `[[6,6],[6,6]]` and `[[3,3],[3,3]]`).\n        e.  Fill any remaining unspecified cells in the output grid with the background digit ('8').\n4.  **Final Output:** Return the generated output grid."
