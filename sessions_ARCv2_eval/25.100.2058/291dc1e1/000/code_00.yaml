input_grid:
  dimensions: [20, 8]
  value_range: 0-9
  structure: 2D grid of integers
  features:
    - Column 0: Mostly '1', first row is '0'.
    - Column 1: Mostly '8'.
    - Columns 2-7: Contain various numerical patterns, often in 2-row high configurations, embedded within regions of '8'.
    - Notable patterns (within cols 2-7):
      - Pairs of identical rows exist (e.g., rows 2-3, 8-9, 12-13, 16-17).
      - Specific 2-row structures observed:
        - `[[4, 4], [4, 4]]` (multiple locations)
        - `[[9, 9], [9, 9]]`
        - `[[6, 6], [6, 6]]` (multiple locations)
        - `[[7, 7], [7, 7]]` (multiple locations)
        - `[[3, 3], [3, 3]]`
        - `[[1], [2]]` (vertical pair in col 2)
        - `[[4, 7], [7, 4]]` (diagonal pair)
output_grid:
  dimensions: [12, 6]
  value_range: 1-9 (0 is absent)
  structure: 2D grid of integers
  features:
    - Contains rearranged/combined patterns from the input's central columns.
    - '8' appears as a frequent background/padding value.
    - Specific patterns from input are present:
      - `4 4` block appears twice.
      - `9 9` block appears once.
    - Composite patterns are present:
      - Rows 3-4 combine `1 2` and `6 6`.
      - Rows 5-6 combine `6 6` and `3 3`.
      - Rows 11-12 combine `4 7`/`7 4` and `7 7`.
relationship:
  - The output grid seems derived from the input grid's columns 2 through 7.
  - Specific 2-row high patterns are extracted from the input.
  - These patterns are placed, sometimes combined, into a fixed 12x6 output layout.
  - The background value '8' fills unspecified areas in the output.
