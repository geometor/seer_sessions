Okay, let's break down the transformation based on this first example.

**Initial Perception:**

The input is a 20x8 grid of single digits. The output is a smaller 12x6 grid. The numbers appear to represent colors or categories in a pixel-like grid. The transformation seems to involve extracting specific, smaller patterns or "objects" from a central region of the input grid and arranging them into the output grid. The number '8' appears frequently in both input and output, possibly acting as a background or default color. The core task seems to be recognizing certain 2-row high patterns (mostly 2x2 blocks, but also some 2x1 or mixed blocks) within columns 2-7 of the input and then assembling these recognized patterns into the fixed-size output grid, potentially combining or overlaying them.

**Observed Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: [20, 8]
  value_range: 0-9
  structure: 2D grid of integers
  features:
    - Column 0: Mostly '1', first row is '0'.
    - Column 1: Mostly '8'.
    - Columns 2-7: Contain various numerical patterns, often in 2-row high configurations, embedded within regions of '8'.
    - Notable patterns (within cols 2-7):
      - Pairs of identical rows exist (e.g., rows 2-3, 8-9, 12-13, 16-17).
      - Specific 2-row structures observed:
        - `[[4, 4], [4, 4]]` (multiple locations)
        - `[[9, 9], [9, 9]]`
        - `[[6, 6], [6, 6]]` (multiple locations)
        - `[[7, 7], [7, 7]]` (multiple locations)
        - `[[3, 3], [3, 3]]`
        - `[[1], [2]]` (vertical pair in col 2)
        - `[[4, 7], [7, 4]]` (diagonal pair)
output_grid:
  dimensions: [12, 6]
  value_range: 1-9 (0 is absent)
  structure: 2D grid of integers
  features:
    - Contains rearranged/combined patterns from the input's central columns.
    - '8' appears as a frequent background/padding value.
    - Specific patterns from input are present:
      - `4 4` block appears twice.
      - `9 9` block appears once.
    - Composite patterns are present:
      - Rows 3-4 combine `1 2` and `6 6`.
      - Rows 5-6 combine `6 6` and `3 3`.
      - Rows 11-12 combine `4 7`/`7 4` and `7 7`.
relationship:
  - The output grid seems derived from the input grid's columns 2 through 7.
  - Specific 2-row high patterns are extracted from the input.
  - These patterns are placed, sometimes combined, into a fixed 12x6 output layout.
  - The background value '8' fills unspecified areas in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program (Based on this example only):**

1.  **Focus:** Isolate the central 6 columns (columns 2 through 7) of the 20-row input grid.
2.  **Identify Patterns:** Scan this 20x6 subgrid to find all occurrences of the following specific 2-row high patterns:
    *   `P_44`: A 2x2 block of `4`.
    *   `P_99`: A 2x2 block of `9`.
    *   `P_66`: A 2x2 block of `6`.
    *   `P_77`: A 2x2 block of `7`.
    *   `P_33`: A 2x2 block of `3`.
    *   `P_12`: A 2x1 block with `1` above `2`.
    *   `P_4774`: A 2x2 block with `4` top-left, `7` top-right, `7` bottom-left, `4` bottom-right.
3.  **Construct Output:** Create a new 12x6 grid.
4.  **Populate Output:** Fill the output grid according to the following specific layout, using the patterns identified in step 2 and filling remaining cells with '8':
    *   Rows 1-2: Place `P_44` centered horizontally (`8 8 4 4 8 8`).
    *   Rows 7-8: Place `P_99` centered horizontally (`8 8 9 9 8 8`).
    *   Rows 9-10: Place `P_44` centered horizontally (`8 8 4 4 8 8`).
    *   Row 3: Fill with `6`.
    *   Row 4: Place `P_12` at columns 1-2, fill remaining columns 3-6 with `6`. (`1 2 6 6 6 6`).
    *   Row 5: Place `P_66` at columns 2-3, place `P_33` at columns 4-5. Fill remaining with `8`. (`8 6 6 3 3 8`).
    *   Row 6: Place `P_33` twice, at columns 2-3 and 4-5. Fill remaining with `8`. (`8 3 3 3 3 8`).
    *   Row 11: Place the top row of `P_4774` (`4 7`) at columns 1-2, fill remaining columns 3-6 with `7`. (`7 4 7 7 7 7`). Note: The first '7' seems to come from P_4774 or P_77. Let's refine: Row 11 is `[7, 4, 7, 7, 7, 7]`. Maybe derived from `P_4774`'s `[4, 7]` and `P_77`.
    *   Row 12: Place the bottom row of `P_4774` (`7 4`) at columns 1-2, fill remaining columns 3-6 with `7`. (`4 7 7 7 7 7`). Let's refine: Row 12 is `[4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]`. Maybe derived from `P_4774`'s `[7, 4]` and `P_77`.
    *   Refined step for Rows 11-12: Place the `P_4774` pattern (specifically `[[4, 7], [7, 4]]`) at columns 1-2 (`[[?, 4, ?, ...], [?, 7, ?, ...]]`) and overlay/fill the rest with `7`s derived from `P_77`. Output: `[[7, 4, 7, 7, 7, 7], [4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]]`. This seems inconsistent with the pattern definition. Let's re-examine P_4774: Input rows 10-11, cols 5-6 are `[[4, 7], [7, 4]]`. Output rows 11-12, cols 1-2 are `[[7, 4], [4, 7]]`. This looks like the pattern is transposed or rotated, or my pattern identification was slightly off. Let's adjust: Output rows 11-12, columns 1-2 use the `[[7, 4], [4, 7]]` block (which is the `P_4774` pattern found transposed?), and columns 3-6 are filled with `7` (from `P_7
