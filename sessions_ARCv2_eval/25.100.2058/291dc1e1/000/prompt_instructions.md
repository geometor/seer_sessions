**INSTRUCTIONS**

Above is the *first* example pair for a task.

This is your initial opportunity to perceive the underlying logic that transforms the
input into the output.

Respond with the following deliverables:

- Your initial perception of the elements of the task based *only* on this example.
- A YAML block documenting facts observed in *this* example - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, actions performed on them, and the relationships between them.
- A natural language program describing the transformation rule based *only* on this example.

Your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a conversation.
We will refine this understanding with subsequent examples.
