The numbers appear to represent colors or categories in a pixel-like grid. The transformation seems to involve extracting specific, smaller patterns or \"objects\" from a central region of the input grid and arranging them into the output grid. The number '8' appears frequently in both input and output, possibly acting as a background or default color. The core task seems to be recognizing certain 2-row high patterns (mostly 2x2 blocks, but also some 2x1 or mixed blocks) within columns 2-7 of the input and then assembling these recognized patterns into the fixed-size output grid, potentially combining or overlaying them.\n\n**Observed Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

(`1 2 6 6 6 6`).\n    *   Row 5: Place `P_66` at columns 2-3, place `P_33` at columns 4-5. Fill remaining with `8`. (`8 6 6 3 3 8`).\n    *   Row 6: Place `P_33` twice, at columns 2-3 and 4-5. Fill remaining with `8`. (`8 3 3 3 3 8`).\n    *   Row 11: Place the top row of `P_4774` (`4 7`) at columns 1-2, fill remaining columns 3-6 with `7`. (`7 4 7 7 7 7`). Note: The first '7' seems to come from P_4774 or P_77. Let's refine: Row 11 is `[7, 4, 7, 7, 7, 7]`. Maybe derived from `P_4774`'s `[4, 7]` and `P_77`.\n    *   Row 12: Place the bottom row of `P_4774` (`7 4`) at columns 1-2, fill remaining columns 3-6 with `7`. (`4 7 7 7 7 7`). Let's refine: Row 12 is `[4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]`. Maybe derived from `P_4774`'s `[7, 4]` and `P_77`.\n    *   Refined step for Rows 11-12: Place the `P_4774` pattern (specifically `[[4, 7], [7, 4]]`) at columns 1-2 (`[[?, 4, ?, ...], [?, 7, ?, ...]]`) and overlay/fill the rest with `7`s derived from `P_77`. Output: `[[7, 4, 7, 7, 7, 7], [4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]]`. This seems inconsistent with the pattern definition. Let's re-examine P_4774: Input rows 10-11, cols 5-6 are `[[4, 7], [7, 4]]`. Output rows 11-12, cols 1-2 are `[[7, 4], [4, 7]]`. This looks like the pattern is transposed or rotated, or my pattern identification was slightly off. Let's adjust: Output rows 11-12, columns 1-2 use the `[[7, 4], [4, 7]]` block (which is the `P_4774` pattern found transposed?), and columns 3-6 are filled with `7` (from `P_7"
