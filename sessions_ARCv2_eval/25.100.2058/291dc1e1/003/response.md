**Refined Perception:**

Based on all four examples, the task consistently involves identifying rectangular "objects" composed of non-background digits ('8') that are exactly two rows high. These objects reside within a core area of the input grid, excluding border rows and columns. The transformation then generates an output grid based on these identified objects using one of two distinct strategies: Stacking or Composition.

*   **Core Area:** The relevant data is consistently found by excluding the first two rows (index 0, 1) and the first two columns (index 0, 1) as well as the last column (index -1) of the input grid.
*   **Object Identification:** Within this core area, the algorithm finds all maximal connected rectangular components of digits other than '8' that span exactly two rows.
*   **Strategy Selection:** The choice between Stacking and Composition appears primarily linked to the input grid's structure, potentially its height or specific patterns in the header rows/objects.
    *   **Composition (`train_1`):** Used for taller grids (e.g., 20 rows) potentially containing specific asymmetric/complex objects. It involves placing (potentially transformed) representations of *object types* onto a fixed-size canvas according to a predefined layout. The first row pattern `0 2...` might also be a trigger.
    *   **Stacking (`train_2`, `train_3`, `train_4`):** Used for shorter grids (e.g., 8 rows). It involves taking all identified object *instances* and arranging them vertically in the output. The output width is determined by the widest object found, and each object is centered horizontally with '8' padding. The specific vertical *order* of stacking seems dependent on the pattern of the *first* input row:
        *   If the first input row starts `0 1 1...` (`train_2`, `train_3`), objects are stacked in the order they are found (top-to-bottom, left-to-right within the core input).
        *   If the first input row starts `1 1 1...` (`train_4`), objects found within the same horizontal band of rows (e.g., input rows 2-3, then input rows 5-6) are grouped, and within each group, they are stacked in *reverse* order of appearance (right-to-left). The groups themselves are processed top-to-bottom.

**Updated YAML Facts:**


```yaml
common_properties:
  background_digit: 8
  object_height: 2 # Key patterns/objects are consistently 2 rows high.
  ignored_input_rows: [0, 1] # First two rows.
  ignored_input_columns: [0, 1, -1] # First two and last columns.
  object_definition: Maximal connected rectangular components of non-background digits, exactly 2 rows high, within the core input area.

transformation_strategies:
  - strategy_name: Stacking
    observed_in: [train_2, train_3, train_4]
    trigger_conditions:
      - Input grid height <= 10 (tentative)
      - AND absence of specific complex/asymmetric patterns seen in train_1.
      - Potentially correlated with input row 0 patterns (`0 1...` or `1 1...`).
    input_processing: Identify all object *instances* and their locations within the core input.
    output_construction:
      - Determine max object width (`W`).
      - Output dimensions: `(2 * num_objects) x W`.
      - Determine object order based on input row 0:
        - If row 0 starts `0 1 1...`: Order is top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan of core input.
        - If row 0 starts `1 1 1...`: Group objects by row pairs (e.g., core rows 0-1, then 2-3, etc.). Order is group-by-group (top-down), and within each group, right-to-left scan.
      - For each object instance (in determined order):
        - Center its pattern horizontally in width `W`, padding with background_digit.
        - Append the resulting 2 rows to the output.

**Updated Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Define Constants:** Set the background digit to '8'. Define ignored input rows as `[0, 1]` and ignored input columns as `[0, 1, -1]`.
2.  **Read Input:** Load the input grid.
3.  **Determine Strategy:**
    *   Check input grid dimensions and potentially the pattern in row 0.
    *   **Hypothesis:** If grid height > 10 OR row 0 starts `0 2...`, select **Composition Strategy**.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Else (grid height <= 10 AND row 0 starts `0 1...` or `1 1...`), select **Stacking Strategy**.
4.  **Isolate Core Input:** Create a core subgrid by removing the ignored rows and columns from the input grid.
5.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the core input subgrid to find all maximal connected rectangular components of non-background digits that span exactly two rows. Store each object instance, recording its pattern (grid of digits), its dimensions (width), and its top-left coordinates within the core subgrid.
6.  **Execute Strategy:**
    *   **If Stacking Strategy:**
        a.  Determine the stacking order:
            i.  Read the pattern of the *original* input grid's row 0.
            ii. If row 0 starts `0 1...`: Order objects by their top coordinate, then left coordinate (Top-to-Bottom, Left-to-Right).
            iii. If row 0 starts `1 1...`: Group objects based on their top coordinate (e.g., top=0, top=2, top=4...). Order the groups by the top coordinate. Within each group, order the objects by their left coordinate in *descending* order (Right-to-Left). Concatenate these ordered groups to get the final object sequence.
        b.  Calculate the maximum width (`max_width`) among all identified object instances.
        c.  Initialize an empty output grid.
        d.  For each object instance, in the determined stacking order:
            i.  Calculate left/right padding counts needed to center the object's pattern within `max_width` using the background digit.
            ii. Create the two padded rows for this object.
            iii. Append these two rows to the output grid.
    *   **If Composition Strategy (Example based on `train_1`):**
        a.  Identify the *types* of objects present in the input (e.g., `T_44`, `T_99`, `T_12_66`, `T_66`, `T_4774`, `T_77`, `T_33`).
        b.  Initialize a fixed-size output grid (e.g., 12x6 for `train_1`) filled with the background digit.
        c.  Apply a predefined set of rules (specific to this strategy/input type) to populate the output grid based on the presence and potentially location/combination of object types. This may involve transformations. (Refer to `train_1` analysis for specific rules observed).
7.  **Return Output:** Return the final constructed output grid.
