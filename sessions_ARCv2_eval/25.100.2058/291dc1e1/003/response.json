            "text": "**Refined Perception:**\n\nBased on all four examples, the task consistently involves identifying rectangular \"objects\" composed of non-background digits ('8') that are exactly two rows high. These objects reside within a core area of the input grid, excluding border rows and columns. The transformation then generates an output grid based on these identified objects using one of two distinct strategies: Stacking or Composition.\n\n*   **Core Area:** The relevant data is consistently found by excluding the first two rows (index 0, 1) and the first two columns (index 0, 1) as well as the last column (index -1) of the input grid.\n*   **Object Identification:** Within this core area, the algorithm finds all maximal connected rectangular components of digits other than '8' that span exactly two rows.\n*   **Strategy Selection:** The choice between Stacking and Composition appears primarily linked to the input grid's structure, potentially its height or specific patterns in the header rows/objects.\n    *   **Composition (`train_1`):** Used for taller grids (e.g., 20 rows) potentially containing specific asymmetric/complex objects. It involves placing (potentially transformed) representations of *object types* onto a fixed-size canvas according to a predefined layout. The first row pattern `0 2...` might also be a trigger.\n    *   **Stacking (`train_2`, `train_3`, `train_4`):** Used for shorter grids (e.g., 8 rows). It involves taking all identified object *instances* and arranging them vertically in the output. The output width is determined by the widest object found, and each object is centered horizontally with '8' padding. The specific vertical *order* of stacking seems dependent on the pattern of the *first* input row:\n        *   If the first input row starts `0 1 1...` (`train_2`, `train_3`), objects are stacked in the order they are found (top-to-bottom, left-to-right within the core input).\n        *   If the first input row starts `1 1 1...` (`train_4`), objects found within the same horizontal band of rows (e.g., input rows 2-3, then input rows 5-6) are grouped, and within each group, they are stacked in *reverse* order of appearance (right-to-left). The groups themselves are processed top-to-bottom.\n\n**Updated YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Define ignored input rows as `[0, 1]` and ignored input columns as `[0, 1, -1]`.\n2.  **Read Input:** Load the input grid.\n3.  **Determine Strategy:**\n    *   Check input grid dimensions and potentially the pattern in row 0.\n    *   **Hypothesis:** If grid height > 10 OR row 0 starts `0 2...`, select **Composition Strategy**.\n    *   **Hypothesis:** Else (grid height <= 10 AND row 0 starts `0 1...` or `1 1...`), select **Stacking Strategy**.\n4.  **Isolate Core Input:** Create a core subgrid by removing the ignored rows and columns from the input grid.\n5.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the core input subgrid to find all maximal connected rectangular components of non-background digits that span exactly two rows. Store each object instance, recording its pattern (grid of digits), its dimensions (width), and its top-left coordinates within the core subgrid.\n6.  **Execute Strategy:**\n    *   **If Stacking Strategy:**\n        a.  Determine the stacking order:\n            i.  Read the pattern of the *original* input grid's row 0.\n            ii. If row 0 starts `0 1...`: Order objects by their top coordinate, then left coordinate (Top-to-Bottom, Left-to-Right).\n            iii. If row 0 starts `1 1...`: Group objects based on their top coordinate (e.g., top=0, top=2, top=4...). Order the groups by the top coordinate. Within each group, order the objects by their left coordinate in *descending* order (Right-to-Left). Concatenate these ordered groups to get the final object sequence.\n        b.

Calculate left/right padding counts needed to center the object's pattern within `max_width` using the background digit.\n            ii. Create the two padded rows for this object.\n            iii. Append these two rows to the output grid.\n    *   **If Composition Strategy (Example based on `train_1`):**\n        a.  Identify the *types* of objects present in the input (e.g., `T_44`, `T_99`, `T_12_66`, `T_66`, `T_4774`, `T_77`, `T_33`).\n        b.  Initialize a fixed-size output grid (e.g., 12x6 for `train_1`) filled with the background digit.\n        c.  Apply a predefined set of rules (specific to this strategy/input type) to populate the output grid based on the presence and potentially location/combination of object types. This may involve transformations. (Refer to `train_1` analysis for specific rules observed).\n7.  **Return Output:** Return the final constructed output grid."
