Okay, let's break down the transformation based on this first example.

**Initial Perception:**

The input is a 20x8 grid of single digits. The output is a smaller 12x6 grid. The numbers appear to represent colors or categories in a pixel-like grid. The transformation seems to involve extracting specific, smaller patterns or "objects" from a central region of the input grid and arranging them into the output grid. The number '8' appears frequently in both input and output, possibly acting as a background or default color. The core task seems to be recognizing certain 2-row high patterns (mostly 2x2 blocks, but also some 2x1 or mixed blocks) within columns 2-7 of the input and then assembling these recognized patterns into the fixed-size output grid, potentially combining or overlaying them.

**Observed Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: [20, 8]
  value_range: 0-9
  structure: 2D grid of integers
  features:
    - Column 0: Mostly '1', first row is '0'.
    - Column 1: Mostly '8'.
    - Columns 2-7: Contain various numerical patterns, often in 2-row high configurations, embedded within regions of '8'.
    - Notable patterns (within cols 2-7):
      - Pairs of identical rows exist (e.g., rows 2-3, 8-9, 12-13, 16-17).
      - Specific 2-row structures observed:
        - `[[4, 4], [4, 4]]` (multiple locations)
        - `[[9, 9], [9, 9]]`
        - `[[6, 6], [6, 6]]` (multiple locations)
        - `[[7, 7], [7, 7]]` (multiple locations)
        - `[[3, 3], [3, 3]]`
        - `[[1], [2]]` (vertical pair in col 2)
        - `[[4, 7], [7, 4]]` (diagonal pair)
output_grid:
  dimensions: [12, 6]
  value_range: 1-9 (0 is absent)
  structure: 2D grid of integers
  features:
    - Contains rearranged/combined patterns from the input's central columns.
    - '8' appears as a frequent background/padding value.
    - Specific patterns from input are present:
      - `4 4` block appears twice.
      - `9 9` block appears once.
    - Composite patterns are present:
      - Rows 3-4 combine `1 2` and `6 6`.
      - Rows 5-6 combine `6 6` and `3 3`.
      - Rows 11-12 combine `4 7`/`7 4` and `7 7`.
relationship:
  - The output grid seems derived from the input grid's columns 2 through 7.
  - Specific 2-row high patterns are extracted from the input.
  - These patterns are placed, sometimes combined, into a fixed 12x6 output layout.
  - The background value '8' fills unspecified areas in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program (Based on this example only):**

1.  **Focus:** Isolate the central 6 columns (columns 2 through 7) of the 20-row input grid.
2.  **Identify Patterns:** Scan this 20x6 subgrid to find all occurrences of the following specific 2-row high patterns:
    *   `P_44`: A 2x2 block of `4`.
    *   `P_99`: A 2x2 block of `9`.
    *   `P_66`: A 2x2 block of `6`.
    *   `P_77`: A 2x2 block of `7`.
    *   `P_33`: A 2x2 block of `3`.
    *   `P_12`: A 2x1 block with `1` above `2`.
    *   `P_4774`: A 2x2 block with `4` top-left, `7` top-right, `7` bottom-left, `4` bottom-right.
3.  **Construct Output:** Create a new 12x6 grid.
4.  **Populate Output:** Fill the output grid according to the following specific layout, using the patterns identified in step 2 and filling remaining cells with '8':
    *   Rows 1-2: Place `P_44` centered horizontally (`8 8 4 4 8 8`).
    *   Rows 7-8: Place `P_99` centered horizontally (`8 8 9 9 8 8`).
    *   Rows 9-10: Place `P_44` centered horizontally (`8 8 4 4 8 8`).
    *   Row 3: Fill with `6`.
    *   Row 4: Place `P_12` at columns 1-2, fill remaining columns 3-6 with `6`. (`1 2 6 6 6 6`).
    *   Row 5: Place `P_66` at columns 2-3, place `P_33` at columns 4-5. Fill remaining with `8`. (`8 6 6 3 3 8`).
    *   Row 6: Place `P_33` twice, at columns 2-3 and 4-5. Fill remaining with `8`. (`8 3 3 3 3 8`).
    *   Row 11: Place the top row of `P_4774` (`4 7`) at columns 1-2, fill remaining columns 3-6 with `7`. (`7 4 7 7 7 7`). Note: The first '7' seems to come from P_4774 or P_77. Let's refine: Row 11 is `[7, 4, 7, 7, 7, 7]`. Maybe derived from `P_4774`'s `[4, 7]` and `P_77`.
    *   Row 12: Place the bottom row of `P_4774` (`7 4`) at columns 1-2, fill remaining columns 3-6 with `7`. (`4 7 7 7 7 7`). Let's refine: Row 12 is `[4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]`. Maybe derived from `P_4774`'s `[7, 4]` and `P_77`.
    *   Refined step for Rows 11-12: Place the `P_4774` pattern (specifically `[[4, 7], [7, 4]]`) at columns 1-2 (`[[?, 4, ?, ...], [?, 7, ?, ...]]`) and overlay/fill the rest with `7`s derived from `P_77`. Output: `[[7, 4, 7, 7, 7, 7], [4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]]`. This seems inconsistent with the pattern definition. Let's re-examine P_4774: Input rows 10-11, cols 5-6 are `[[4, 7], [7, 4]]`. Output rows 11-12, cols 1-2 are `[[7, 4], [4, 7]]`. This looks like the pattern is transposed or rotated, or my pattern identification was slightly off. Let's adjust: Output rows 11-12, columns 1-2 use the `[[7, 4], [4, 7]]` block (which is the `P_4774` pattern found transposed?), and columns 3-6 are filled with `7` (from `P_7

8 9 9 8
```

Okay, let's refine the analysis based on the new example (`train_2`).

**Refined Perception:**

The core task remains identifying significant patterns (or "objects") within a central region of the input grid, ignoring likely border/padding columns (like column 0, 1, and the last column) and potentially the first row. These objects consistently appear to be exactly two rows high. The primary background or padding digit is '8'.

The key difference highlighted by `train_2` is the *output construction mechanism*.

*   In `train_1`, the output seemed to be a fixed 12x6 canvas where specific identified input object *types* were placed, sometimes composed or transformed, into predefined locations.
*   In `train_2`, the output size (8x4) is directly determined by the identified objects. It seems to be a simple vertical stack of representations of *all* found objects, padded horizontally with '8's to match the width of the widest object found.

This suggests two potential modes of operation or two classes of problems: one involving complex, fixed-layout composition (`train_1`) and another involving simple, dynamic-layout stacking (`train_2`). The trigger for which mode to use might depend on the input structure or the types of objects found.

**Updated YAML Facts:**

    structure: Dynamic layout determined by identified objects.
    relationship: Simple stacking. Output width matches max object width. Each object is centered horizontally with '8' padding and placed vertically in order of detection.
```


**Updated Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Isolate Core:** Identify the relevant core subgrid of the input by excluding border rows/columns that primarily contain padding ('8') or indexing information (like the first column, second column, last column). Assume the background/padding digit is '8'.
2.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the core subgrid to detect all connected components (objects) of non-'8' digits that are exactly two rows high. Record the pattern (digit grid) for each object found.
3.  **Determine Output Strategy:** Analyze the set of identified objects and potentially the overall input structure to select the appropriate output generation strategy:
    *   **Strategy A (Stacking):** If the task follows the pattern observed in `train_2` (e.g., perhaps simpler object structures, or a specific input configuration), construct the output as follows:
        a.  Find the maximum width (`max_width`) among all identified objects.
        b.  Initialize an empty output grid. The number of rows will be `2 * number_of_objects`, and the number of columns will be `max_width`.
        c.  Iterate through the identified objects (e.g., in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order of their appearance in the input core).
        d.  For each object, create its 2x`max_width` representation by horizontally centering its pattern and padding with the background digit ('8') on the left/right as needed.
        e.  Append these two rows to the output grid.
    *   **Strategy B (Composition):** If the task follows the pattern observed in `train_1` (e.g., more complex object interactions, transformations required, or a specific input configuration), construct the output using a predefined mapping:
        a.  Initialize a fixed-size output grid (e.g., 12x6 for `train_1`).
        b.  Identify the *types* of objects found in the input (e.g., `[[4,4],[4,4]]`, `[[1,6],[2,6]]`, `[[4,7],[7,4]]`, etc.).
        c.  For each required output pattern/region, check if the corresponding input object type(s) were found.
        d.  If found, populate the target region in the output grid using the specified composition or transformation rule for that object type (e.g., place a padded `[[4,4],[4,4]]`, use the `[[1],[2]]` part of `[[1,6],[2,6]]`, use a transposed `[[4,7],[7,4]]`, combine parts of `[[6,6],[6,6]]` and `[[3,3],[3,3]]`).
        e.  Fill any remaining unspecified cells in the output grid with the background digit ('8').
4.  **Final Output:** Return the generated output grid.

```

**Refined Perception:**

Based on the three examples, the core task involves identifying rectangular, two-row high "objects" composed of digits other than '8' within a central subgrid of the input. The background digit '8' is used for padding in the output and is ignored when identifying objects. The first few columns (index 0, 1) and the last column of the input appear to be border/padding and are ignored. The first one or two rows might also be header/ignored.

Two distinct transformation strategies seem to exist:

1.  **Stacking Strategy (Observed in `train_2`, `train_3`):** All identified 2-row high object *instances* are extracted. The maximum width among these objects determines the output width. Each object is then represented in the output, centered horizontally within the maximum width (padded with '8's), and stacked vertically in the order they appear in the input (top-to-bottom, left-to-right). The output dimensions are dynamic (`2 * num_objects` rows, `max_object_width` columns). This strategy seems applicable when the input objects are relatively simple and clearly separated.

2.  **Composition Strategy (Observed in `train_1`):** Specific *types* of 2-row high objects found in the input trigger placement and potential transformation onto a *fixed-size* output canvas (12x6 in `train_1`). The output is constructed based on a predefined layout rule, potentially combining elements from different object types, applying transformations (like transposition/rotation), and filling unspecified areas with '8'. This strategy seems applicable for inputs with more complex pattern arrangements or specific object types requiring transformation/combination.

The determining factor between these two strategies is not yet fully clear but might relate to input grid dimensions (e.g., taller inputs like `train_1` use Composition) or the presence of specific complex/asymmetric object types (like `[[1,6],[2,6]]` or `[[4,7],[7,4]]` in `train_1`).

**Updated Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Define Constants:** Set the background digit (assumed '8'). Define ignored input rows (e.g., 0, 1) and columns (e.g., 0, 1, last).
2.  **Isolate Core Input:** Extract the subgrid from the input by removing the ignored rows and columns.
3.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the core input subgrid row by row, then column by column. Identify all connected components of non-background digits that span exactly two rows. Store each unique object found, recording its pattern (grid of digits) and its dimensions (width).
4.  **Determine Strategy:** Analyze the input grid's properties (e.g., dimensions) and the characteristics of the identified objects.
    *   **Hypothesis:** If the input grid height is large (e.g., > 8 rows) OR if specific complex/asymmetric patterns like `[[1,6],[2,6]]` or `[[4,7],[7,4]]` are present, select the **Composition Strategy**.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Otherwise, select the **Stacking Strategy**.
5.  **Execute Strategy:**
    *   **If Stacking Strategy:**
        a.  Collect all identified object *instances* in the order they were found (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
        b.  Calculate the maximum width (`max_width`) among all collected object instances.
        c.  Initialize an empty output grid.
        d.  For each object instance:
            i.  Determine the necessary left/right padding with the background digit to center the object's pattern within `max_width`.
            ii. Create the two padded rows for this object.
            iii. Append these two rows to the output grid.
    *   **If Composition Strategy (Example based on `train_1`):**
        a.  Identify the *types* of objects present in the input (e.g., `T_44`, `T_99`, `T_12_66`, `T_66`, `T_4774`, `T_77`, `T_33`).
        b.  Initialize a fixed-size output grid (e.g., 12x6 for `train_1`) filled with the background digit.
        c.  Apply a predefined set of rules to populate the output grid based on the presence of object types:
            *   If `T_44` exists, place `[[4,4],[4,4]]` at rows 1-2, cols 3-4 AND rows 9-10, cols 3-4.

**Refined Perception:**

Based on all four examples, the task consistently involves identifying rectangular "objects" composed of non-background digits ('8') that are exactly two rows high. These objects reside within a core area of the input grid, excluding border rows and columns. The transformation then generates an output grid based on these identified objects using one of two distinct strategies: Stacking or Composition.

*   **Core Area:** The relevant data is consistently found by excluding the first two rows (index 0, 1) and the first two columns (index 0, 1) as well as the last column (index -1) of the input grid.
*   **Object Identification:** Within this core area, the algorithm finds all maximal connected rectangular components of digits other than '8' that span exactly two rows.
*   **Strategy Selection:** The choice between Stacking and Composition appears primarily linked to the input grid's structure, potentially its height or specific patterns in the header rows/objects.
    *   **Composition (`train_1`):** Used for taller grids (e.g., 20 rows) potentially containing specific asymmetric/complex objects. It involves placing (potentially transformed) representations of *object types* onto a fixed-size canvas according to a predefined layout. The first row pattern `0 2...` might also be a trigger.
    *   **Stacking (`train_2`, `train_3`, `train_4`):** Used for shorter grids (e.g., 8 rows). It involves taking all identified object *instances* and arranging them vertically in the output. The output width is determined by the widest object found, and each object is centered horizontally with '8' padding. The specific vertical *order* of stacking seems dependent on the pattern of the *first* input row:
        *   If the first input row starts `0 1 1...` (`train_2`, `train_3`), objects are stacked in the order they are found (top-to-bottom, left-to-right within the core input).
        *   If the first input row starts `1 1 1...` (`train_4`), objects found within the same horizontal band of rows (e.g., input rows 2-3, then input rows 5-6) are grouped, and within each group, they are stacked in *reverse* order of appearance (right-to-left). The groups themselves are processed top-to-bottom.

**Updated YAML Facts:**

  object_height: 2 # Key patterns/objects are consistently 2 rows high.
  ignored_input_rows: [0, 1] # First two rows.
  ignored_input_columns: [0, 1, -1] # First two and last columns.
  object_definition: Maximal connected rectangular components of non-background digits, exactly 2 rows high, within the core input area.

transformation_strategies:

    observed_in: [train_2, train_3, train_4]
    trigger_conditions:
      - Input grid height <= 10 (tentative)
      - AND absence of specific complex/asymmetric patterns seen in train_1.
      - Potentially correlated with input row 0 patterns (`0 1...` or `1 1...`).
    input_processing: Identify all object *instances* and their locations within the core input.
    output_construction:
      - Determine max object width (`W`).
      - Output dimensions: `(2 * num_objects) x W`.
      - Determine object order based on input row 0:
        - If row 0 starts `0 1 1...`: Order is top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan of core input.
        - If row 0 starts `1 1 1...`: Group objects by row pairs (e.g., core rows 0-1, then 2-3, etc.). Order is group-by-group (top-down), and within each group, right-to-left scan.
      - For each object instance (in determined order):
        - Center its pattern horizontally in width `W`, padding with background_digit.
        - Append the resulting 2 rows to the output.

**Updated Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Define Constants:** Set the background digit to '8'. Define ignored input rows as `[0, 1]` and ignored input columns as `[0, 1, -1]`.
2.  **Read Input:** Load the input grid.
3.  **Determine Strategy:**
    *   Check input grid dimensions and potentially the pattern in row 0.
    *   **Hypothesis:** If grid height > 10 OR row 0 starts `0 2...`, select **Composition Strategy**.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Else (grid height <= 10 AND row 0 starts `0 1...` or `1 1...`), select **Stacking Strategy**.
4.  **Isolate Core Input:** Create a core subgrid by removing the ignored rows and columns from the input grid.
5.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the core input subgrid to find all maximal connected rectangular components of non-background digits that span exactly two rows. Store each object instance, recording its pattern (grid of digits), its dimensions (width), and its top-left coordinates within the core subgrid.
6.  **Execute Strategy:**
    *   **If Stacking Strategy:**
        a.  Determine the stacking order:
            i.  Read the pattern of the *original* input grid's row 0.
            ii. If row 0 starts `0 1...`: Order objects by their top coordinate, then left coordinate (Top-to-Bottom, Left-to-Right).
            iii. If row 0 starts `1 1...`: Group objects based on their top coordinate (e.g., top=0, top=2, top=4...). Order the groups by the top coordinate. Within each group, order the objects by their left coordinate in *descending* order (Right-to-Left). Concatenate these ordered groups to get the final object sequence.
        b.  Calculate the maximum width (`max_width`) among all identified object instances.
        c.  Initialize an empty output grid.
        d.  For each object instance, in the determined stacking order:
            i.  Calculate left/right padding counts needed to center the object's pattern within `max_width` using the background digit.
            ii. Create the two padded rows for this object.
            iii. Append these two rows to the output grid.
    *   **If Composition Strategy (Example based on `train_1`):**
        a.  Identify the *types* of objects present in the input (e.g., `T_44`, `T_99`, `T_12_66`, `T_66`, `T_4774`, `T_77`, `T_33`).
        b.  Initialize a fixed-size output grid (e.g., 12x6 for `train_1`) filled with the background digit.
        c.  Apply a predefined set of rules (specific to this strategy/input type) to populate the output grid based on the presence and potentially location/combination of object types. This may involve transformations. (Refer to `train_1` analysis for specific rules observed).
7.  **Return Output:** Return the final constructed output grid.
