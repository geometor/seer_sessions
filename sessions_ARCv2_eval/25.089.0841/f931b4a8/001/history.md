Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Relationship:** The core task involves identifying a specific region or pattern within the input grid and transforming it to produce the output grid. The transformation rules vary significantly across the examples.
2.  **Input Structure:** The input grids often seem conceptually divided into four quadrants. These quadrants can contain solid blocks of color, repeating patterns, multiple distinct shapes, or background color (white).
3.  **Output Generation:** The output grid is derived from content primarily found in the bottom half (bottom-left and bottom-right quadrants) of the input grid. The top half sometimes provides parameters for the transformation (e.g., tiling dimensions).
4.  **Transformation Variety:** The examples showcase several distinct transformation types:
    *   **Pattern Extraction:** Directly copying a pattern from one quadrant (`train_4`).
    *   **Pattern Tiling:** Repeating a pattern from one quadrant multiple times, with the repetition factor determined by another quadrant (`train_2`).
    *   **Pattern Combination/Modification:** Identifying multiple patterns in one quadrant, modifying their background color using the color from another quadrant, arranging them, and adding a border (`train_3`).
    *   **Color/Pattern Generation:** Creating a new pattern (checkerboard) using colors derived from two quadrants, with specific output dimensions related to the input dimensions (`train_1`).
    *   **Row Composition:** Constructing the output by selecting and stacking specific rows from different bottom quadrants (`train_5`).
5.  **Rule Selection Logic:** The specific rule applied seems to depend on the types of content (solid color, single pattern, multiple patterns, empty) found in the bottom-left (BL) and bottom-right (BR) quadrants, and sometimes the relationship between them or the nature of the pattern itself (e.g., checkerboard vs. row-based).

## Facts


```yaml
Input Grid Properties:
  - structure: Often divisible into four quadrants (TL, TR, BL, BR).
  - quadrant_content: Can be [SolidColor, SinglePattern, MultiPattern, Background].
  - dimensions: Variable (e.g., 8x8, 16x16).

Output Grid Properties:
  - derivation: Primarily derived from content in BL and/or BR input quadrants.
  - size: Variable, determined by the specific transformation rule (can be smaller, larger, or differently proportioned than input quadrants).
  - content: Can be extracted patterns, tiled patterns, combined/modified patterns, generated patterns, or composed rows.

Objects:
  - name: Quadrants (TL, TR, BL, BR)
    properties: [content_type, dimensions, colors, patterns]
  - name: Patterns
    properties: [colors, structure, location (within quadrant), dimensions]
  - name: Solid Colors
    properties: [color_value, location (within quadrant)]

Relationships & Actions:
  - relationship: Output depends on the content_type of BL and BR.
  - relationship: TL quadrant properties (e.g., dimensions) can influence transformations involving BR (e.g., tiling factor).
  - relationship: BL solid color can be used to modify patterns from BR (e.g., background replacement, border color).
  - action: Extract pattern from a quadrant.
  - action: Tile pattern from one quadrant based on properties of another.
  - action: Identify multiple patterns within a quadrant.
  - action: Replace background color within a pattern.
  - action: Combine/Arrange patterns.
  - action: Add border to a pattern/grid.
  - action: Generate new pattern based on colors from different quadrants.
  - action: Select specific rows from quadrants.
  - action: Stack rows to form the output.

Transformation Rules (Conditional):
  - condition: BL=Pattern, BR=Empty -> action: Extract BL pattern.
  - condition: BL=Pattern, BR=Pattern -> action: Tile BR pattern using TL dimensions.
  - condition: BL=Solid, BR=MultiPattern -> action: Combine BR patterns, replace background with BL color, add BL color border.
  - condition: BL=Solid, BR=CheckerboardPattern -> action: Generate new checkerboard from BL/BR colors, specific output size (2*H_in, W_in/2).
  - condition: BL=Solid, BR=RowBasedPattern -> action: Combine specific rows from BL and BR.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Analyze Input Grid:** Divide the input grid into four equal quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR).
2.  **Characterize Bottom Quadrants:** Determine the content type of BL and BR: are they solid single colors, do they contain a single distinct pattern, multiple distinct patterns, or are they mostly background color (white)?
3.  **Select Transformation Rule based on BL and BR content:**
    *   **If** BL contains a pattern and BR is background/empty: The output is the pattern extracted directly from BL.
    *   **Else If** both BL and BR contain patterns: Identify the pattern in BR (P_BR). Find the largest solid-colored rectangle in TL and get its dimensions (H_TL, W_TL). The output is P_BR tiled H_TL times vertically and W_TL times horizontally.
    *   **Else If** BL is a solid color (C_BL) and BR contains pattern(s):
        *   **If** BR contains multiple distinct non-background patterns (P1, P2, ...): Identify the main two patterns (P1, P2). Create modified patterns (P1_mod, P2_mod) by replacing their background color (white) with C_BL within their bounding boxes. Construct a core grid by arranging P1_mod and P2_mod horizontally, then duplicating this row vertically (`[[P1_mod, P2_mod], [P1_mod, P2_mod]]`). The final output is this core grid surrounded by a 1-pixel border of C_BL.
        *   **Else If** BR contains a single pattern (P_BR) that is a checkerboard of a color (C_BR) and background: The output is a new grid of size (2 * Input_Height, Input_Width / 2), filled with a checkerboard pattern using C_BR and C_BL (specifically `[[C_BR, C_BL], [C_BL, C_BR]]` tiled).
        *   **Else If** BR contains a single pattern (P_BR) composed of distinct horizontal rows: The output is created by vertically stacking the following three rows: the first row of P_BR, the first row of BL (treated as a solid row of C_BL), and the third row of P_BR.
