            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Relationship:** The core task involves identifying a specific region or pattern within the input grid and transforming it to produce the output grid. The transformation rules vary significantly across the examples.\n2.  **Input Structure:** The input grids often seem conceptually divided into four quadrants. These quadrants can contain solid blocks of color, repeating patterns, multiple distinct shapes, or background color (white).\n3.  **Output Generation:** The output grid is derived from content primarily found in the bottom half (bottom-left and bottom-right quadrants) of the input grid. The top half sometimes provides parameters for the transformation (e.g., tiling dimensions).\n4.  **Transformation Variety:** The examples showcase several distinct transformation types:\n    *   **Pattern Extraction:** Directly copying a pattern from one quadrant (`train_4`).\n    *   **Pattern Tiling:** Repeating a pattern from one quadrant multiple times, with the repetition factor determined by another quadrant (`train_2`).\n    *   **Pattern Combination/Modification:** Identifying multiple patterns in one quadrant, modifying their background color using the color from another quadrant, arranging them, and adding a border (`train_3`).\n    *   **Color/Pattern Generation:** Creating a new pattern (checkerboard) using colors derived from two quadrants, with specific output dimensions related to the input dimensions (`train_1`).\n    *   **Row Composition:** Constructing the output by selecting and stacking specific rows from different bottom quadrants (`train_5`).\n5.  **Rule Selection Logic:** The specific rule applied seems to depend on the types of content (solid color, single pattern, multiple patterns, empty) found in the bottom-left (BL) and bottom-right (BR) quadrants, and sometimes the relationship between them or the nature of the pattern itself (e.g., checkerboard vs. row-based).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Create modified patterns (P1_mod, P2_mod) by replacing their background color (white) with C_BL within their bounding boxes. Construct a core grid by arranging P1_mod and P2_mod horizontally, then duplicating this row vertically (`[[P1_mod, P2_mod], [P1_mod, P2_mod]]`). The final output is this core grid surrounded by a 1-pixel border of C_BL.\n        *   **Else If** BR contains a single pattern (P_BR) that is a checkerboard of a color (C_BR) and background: The output is a new grid of size (2 * Input_Height, Input_Width / 2), filled with a checkerboard pattern using C_BR and C_BL (specifically `[[C_BR, C_BL], [C_BL, C_BR]]` tiled).\n        *   **Else If** BR contains a single pattern (P_BR) composed of distinct horizontal rows: The output is created by vertically stacking the following three rows: the first row of P_BR, the first row of BL (treated as a solid row of C_BL), and the third row of P_BR.\n4.  **"
