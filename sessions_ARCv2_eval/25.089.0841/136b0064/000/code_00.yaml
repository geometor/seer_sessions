task_description: Copy the portion of the input grid left of a vertical yellow line, discard the line and the rest of the right side, then reposition a single gray pixel (found right of the yellow line) into the output grid based on its original row and its horizontal distance from the yellow line.

input_elements:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - contains multiple colored objects (contiguous non-white pixels)
      - contains a single vertical line of yellow (4) pixels
      - contains a single gray (5) pixel located to the right of the yellow line
      - uses white (0) as background

output_elements:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - height matches input grid height
      - width equals the column index of the yellow line in the input grid
      - contains the objects originally left of the yellow line
      - contains the single gray pixel repositioned
      - does not contain the yellow line

actions:
  - action: Find
    target: Vertical yellow (4) line
    result: Column index `yellow_col`
  - action: Find
    target: Single gray (5) pixel
    condition: Must be right of `yellow_col`
    result: Coordinates (`gray_row`, `gray_col`)
  - action: Determine Output Dimensions
    inputs:
      - Input grid height `H`
      - `yellow_col`
    outputs:
      - Output grid height `H`
      - Output grid width `W = yellow_col`
  - action: Create Grid
    properties:
      - height `H`
      - width `W`
      - initialized with white (0)
    result: Output grid
  - action: Copy Subgrid
    source: Input grid
    source_region: rows 0 to H-1, columns 0 to `yellow_col - 1`
    destination: Output grid
    destination_region: rows 0 to H-1, columns 0 to `W - 1`
  - action: Calculate Position
    inputs:
      - `gray_row`
      - `gray_col`
      - `yellow_col`
    calculation: `output_gray_col = gray_col - yellow_col - 1`
    result: `output_gray_col`
  - action: Place Pixel
    target: Output grid
    position: (`gray_row`, `output_gray_col`)
    value: Gray (5)

relationships:
  - The output grid's width is determined by the horizontal position (column index) of the yellow line in the input.
  - The objects left of the yellow line in the input maintain their relative positions and colors in the output.
  - The gray pixel's vertical position (row) is preserved from input to output.
  - The gray pixel's horizontal position (column) in the output is its horizontal distance from the yellow line in the input (specifically, `input_col - yellow_line_col - 1`).

assumptions:
  - There is always exactly one vertical yellow line.
  - There is always exactly one gray pixel, and it's always located to the right of the yellow line.
