            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The output grid retains the same dimensions as the input grid.\n2.  **Core Transformation:** The primary transformation involves filling in areas of white pixels (color 0) within the input grid. The surrounding structures and most other pixels remain unchanged.\n3.  **Object Identification:** The non-white pixels form distinct shapes or objects. These objects often appear as closed boundaries (like rectangles or other polygons), sometimes complex.\n4.  **Identifying Target Areas:** The white pixels that get filled are those completely enclosed within a non-white shape. White pixels connected to the grid's border are *not* filled. This suggests a concept of \"inside\" vs. \"outside\".\n5.  **Fill Color Determination:** The color used to fill an enclosed white area seems dependent on the color of the single, unique non-white color that forms the immediate boundary around that white area. There appears to be a specific mapping or set of rules:\n    *   If the boundary color is Green (3), the fill color is Green (3).\n    *   If the boundary color is Orange (7), the fill color is Orange (7).\n    *   If the boundary color is Gray (5), the fill color is Gray (5).\n    *   If the boundary color is Gray (8), the fill color is Blue (1).\n    *   If the boundary color is Red (2), the fill color is Orange (7).\n    *   If the boundary color is Yellow (4), the fill color depends on the context of the *entire grid*:\n        *   If Magenta (6) exists anywhere in the input grid, the fill color is Magenta (6) (seen in train\\_1).\n        *   Otherwise, if Gray (5) exists anywhere in the input grid, the fill color is Gray (5) (seen in train\\_2).\n        *   Otherwise, the fill color is Yellow (4) (seen in train\\_3).\n6.  **Process:** The process seems to be:\n    *   Identify all white pixels enclosed by a single color.\n    *   Determine the specific boundary color for each enclosed region.\n    *   Apply the color mapping rule (including the conditional logic for Yellow) to find the fill color.\n    *   Modify the input grid by replacing the enclosed white pixels with their determined fill color.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
