Grid:
  - Type: 2D Array
  - Cell Values: Integers 0-9 (representing colors)
  - Background Color: White (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous areas of non-white pixels.
  - Property: Often form closed boundaries.
  - Property: Can be composed of a single color (monochromatic) or multiple colors.

Target Areas:
  - Type: Regions of white (0) pixels.
  - Property: Must be completely enclosed by non-white pixels (not connected to the grid border by other white pixels).
  - Relationship: Each enclosed white region is bordered by exactly one unique non-white color in the examples provided.

Transformation:
  - Action: Fill enclosed white regions with a specific color.
  - Rule: The fill color (F) is determined by the unique border color (B) of the enclosed region.
  - Mapping:
      - If B=3 (Green), F=3 (Green).
      - If B=7 (Orange), F=7 (Orange).
      - If B=5 (Gray), F=5 (Gray).
      - If B=8 (Gray), F=1 (Blue).
      - If B=2 (Red), F=7 (Orange).
      - If B=4 (Yellow):
          - If color 6 (Magenta) exists anywhere in the input grid, F=6 (Magenta).
          - Else if color 5 (Gray) exists anywhere in the input grid, F=5 (Gray).
          - Else, F=4 (Yellow).
  - Invariance: Pixels not part of an enclosed white region remain unchanged. Grid dimensions remain unchanged.

Assumptions:
  - Each enclosed white region is bordered by only one unique non-white color.
