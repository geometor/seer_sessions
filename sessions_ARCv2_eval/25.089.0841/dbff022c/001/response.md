Transformation Rule:

1. Identify regions of white pixels (color 0) in the input grid.
2. Determine if a white region is "internal" (completely enclosed by non-white pixels) or "external" (connected to the grid border by other white pixels).
3. For each internal white region:
    a. Find the single, unique color (B) of the non-white pixels directly adjacent (sharing a side) to the region.
    b. Determine the fill color (F) based on the border color (B) using the following rules:
        i. If B is Gray (8), F is Blue (1).
        ii. If B is Red (2), F is Orange (7).
        iii. If B is Yellow (4):
            - Check if Magenta (6) exists anywhere in the *entire* input grid. If yes, F is Magenta (6).
            - Else, check if Gray (5) exists anywhere in the *entire* input grid. If yes, F is Gray (5).
            - Otherwise, F is Yellow (4).
        iv. For all other border colors B (e.g., Green(3), Orange(7), Gray(5)), F is the same as B.
    c. Fill all pixels within that internal white region with the determined fill color F in the output grid.
4. External white regions and all non-white pixels remain unchanged in the output grid.
5. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
