task_description: Identify and extract the largest contiguous rectangular area composed of white pixels from the input grid.
grid_properties:
  - input_grid_size: Variable (e.g., 20x22, 23x23, 21x20)
  - output_grid_size: Variable, determined by the size of the identified white rectangle (e.g., 7x7, 7x12, 5x5)
  - dominant_input_background_color: Varies (green, blue, azure), appears irrelevant to the output.
  - output_background_color: Consistently white (0).
objects:
  - type: Contiguous Rectangular Area
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - role: Defines the boundaries of the output grid.
      - location: Varies within the input grid.
      - key_feature: Appears to be the largest such rectangle by area in each input.
  - type: Pixels
    properties:
      - color: Various non-white colors (e.g., red, yellow, azure, blue, green)
      - location: Some are scattered outside the white rectangle (ignored), others are located *inside* the white rectangle (preserved).
      - role: Pixels inside the white rectangle are copied to the output grid in their relative positions.
transformation:
  - action: Find all contiguous rectangular regions composed entirely of white (0) pixels in the input grid.
  - action: Select the rectangular region with the largest area (width * height).
  - action: Extract the subgrid defined by the boundaries of the selected white rectangle.
  - result: The extracted subgrid becomes the output grid.
relationships:
  - The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid.
  - The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the dimensions of the largest white (0) rectangular area found in the input.
  - The content of the output grid (including non-white pixels) is identical to the content within the boundaries of the largest white (0) rectangular area in the input.
