            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous attempt incorrectly assumed the target area to be extracted was a rectangle composed *entirely* of white pixels. The results clearly show this is wrong, as the generated outputs were much smaller than expected and consisted only of white pixels, whereas the expected outputs match the dimensions of a specific white-bordered area in the input and include non-white pixels found within that area.\n\nThe core error lies in the identification criteria for the rectangle. The new hypothesis is that the task requires identifying the largest rectangular region whose *border* is composed entirely of white pixels (0). The content *inside* this border (including non-white pixels) is then extracted.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  Modify the search algorithm to identify candidate rectangles based on their *border* pixels being white (0).\n2.  For each candidate rectangle identified by a white border, calculate its area.\n3.  Select the rectangle with the largest area.\n4.  Extract the subgrid corresponding to the *full extent* of this largest white-bordered rectangle from the input grid.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's verify the coordinates and dimensions of the assumed target rectangles (those with all-white borders) in the training inputs and compare them with the expected output dimensions.\n\n"
