This serves as the background.\n2.  **Key Input Colors:** The significant colors in the input grids, besides the background, are green (3), blue (1), and red (2).\n3.  **Green Pixel:** In each input example, there is exactly one green (3) pixel. Its position varies.\n4.  **Blue/Red Patterns:** The input grids contain patterns (often lines or segments) composed of blue (1) and red (2) pixels.\n5.  **Output Transformation 1 (Color Change):** Comparing inputs and outputs, all blue (1) pixels in the input are changed to red (2) in the output. Original red (2) pixels remain red (2).\n6.  **Output Transformation 2 (Green Extension):** The single green (3) pixel from the input remains in the output. Additionally, new green (3) pixels appear in the output, forming lines extending horizontally and vertically from the original green pixel's location.\n7.  **Extension Rule:** These green lines extend outwards from the original green pixel, overwriting the background azure (8) pixels. The extension stops just *before* hitting a red (2) pixel (either an original red pixel or a blue pixel that was transformed to red) or the boundary of the grid. The red pixels act as barriers.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Locate the coordinates (row `r`, column `c`) of the single green (3) pixel in the original input grid.\n4.  **Extend Upwards:** Starting from the cell directly above the green pixel (`r-1`, `c`), move upwards row by row towards row 0.
