task_description: Filter out background pixels (defined by the top-left corner) and flatten the remaining foreground pixels into a single column, preserving the row-major scan order.
elements:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
    properties:
      - Contains a background color, consistently located at index [0][0].
      - Contains foreground pixels (colors different from the background).
      - Dimensions vary (e.g., 16x16 in the examples).
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
    properties:
      - Always has a width of 1 (a column vector).
      - Height equals the total count of foreground pixels in the input grid.
      - Contains only the foreground colors extracted from the input grid.
      - The order of pixels matches the row-major scan order of foreground pixels in the input.
  - name: background_color
    type: integer (pixel value)
    determination: The color value of the pixel at input_grid[0][0].
  - name: foreground_pixels
    type: list of integers (pixel values)
    determination: All pixels in the input_grid whose color is not equal to the background_color.
relationships:
  - The number of foreground pixels in the input_grid directly determines the height of the output_grid.
  - The sequence of pixels in the output_grid corresponds exactly to the order in which foreground_pixels are encountered when scanning the input_grid row by row (top to bottom), and within each row, column by column (left to right).
actions:
  - Identify the background_color from the pixel at input_grid[0][0].
  - Initialize an empty list to collect foreground pixel values.
  - Iterate through the input_grid using row-major order (row by row, left to right within each row).
  - For each pixel, compare its value to the background_color.
  - If the pixel's value is different from the background_color, append its value to the collection list.
  - Construct the output_grid as a single column where each row contains one pixel value from the collection list, preserving the collected order.
