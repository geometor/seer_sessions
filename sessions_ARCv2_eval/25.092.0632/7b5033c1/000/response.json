There appears to be a dominant background color, which is the color found at the top-left corner (0,0) of the input grid. Scattered across this background are several objects or collections of pixels of different colors.\n\nThe output is always a single column (Nx1 grid) containing a sequence of colors.\n\nThe transformation involves identifying the background color from the input grid's top-left pixel. Then, the input grid is scanned row by row, from top to bottom, and within each row, from left to right. Every pixel encountered that is *not* the background color is collected in the order it was scanned. Finally, these collected pixel colors are arranged sequentially into a single vertical column to form the output grid. The height of the output column corresponds exactly to the total count of non-background pixels in the input grid.\n\n**Facts**\n"
