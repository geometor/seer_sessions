            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided training examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples involve transforming an 18x18 grid of pixels.\n2.  **Background Color:** The background color differs between the two examples. Example 1 has a Yellow (4) background, while Example 2 has a Green (3) background. This difference seems crucial as the transformation rules appear distinct.\n3.  **Objects/Pixels of Interest:** Both grids contain distinct \"objects\" or scattered pixels of various colors, different from the background.\n4.  **Color Changes (Example 1 - Yellow Background):**\n    *   Green (3) pixels seem to swap places/colors with Azure (8) pixels. All original Green pixels become Azure, and all original Azure pixels become Green.\n    *   Some Red (2) pixels also change color to Azure (8). These changed Red pixels appear to be those adjacent (including diagonals) to the *original* locations of the Green pixels. Other Red pixels remain unchanged.\n    *   Blue (1) and Yellow (4) pixels remain unchanged.\n5.  **Color Changes (Example 2 - Green Background):**\n    *   There is initially a single Magenta (6) pixel.\n    *   There are several Yellow (4) pixels.\n    *   In the output, all original Yellow (4) pixels become Magenta (6).\n    *   The original Magenta (6) pixel disappears (becomes the background Green (3)).\n    *   A new Magenta (6) pixel appears at the top edge (row 0) of the grid, in the same column as the Yellow (4) pixel that had the lowest row index in the input grid.\n    *   Blue (1), Red (2), and Green (3) pixels (other than the background replacement for the original Magenta) remain unchanged.\n\n6.  **Transformation Logic:** The core logic appears conditional on the background color. Different rules apply depending on whether the background is Yellow or Green.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
