            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming input grids containing primarily yellow (4), blue (1), and orange (7) pixels into output grids. The core operation seems to revolve around the orange (7) pixels acting as \"contaminants\" or markers for removal. The output grids are generally smaller than or derived from the input grids, with orange pixels consistently absent.\n\nTwo distinct patterns of transformation emerge based on the configuration of orange pixels:\n\n1.  **Regional Cropping and Cleanup (Examples 1 & 2):** When orange pixels are present but not forming distinct, full horizontal lines within sub-blocks, a region on the right side of the grid, seemingly associated with the rightmost orange contamination, is cropped. After cropping, any remaining orange pixels and blue pixels directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to them within the preserved area are replaced by the background color, yellow (4).\n2.  **Block Removal (Example 3):** When orange pixels form complete horizontal rows within a recognizable, vertically stacked block structure (like the 3x3 blocks in example 3), the entire set of rows belonging to the contaminated block(s) is removed.\n\nExample 4 presents a significant inconsistency. Its output grid dimensions (5x12) are drastically different from the input (7x9) in a way that doesn't fit either of the patterns above (adding columns while removing rows). This suggests either a third, more complex rule, or a potential error in the example data provided for train_4. Assuming the first three examples represent the core logic, the transformation targets orange pixels and their context.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Structure:** Examine the input grid. Determine if it's composed of distinct, vertically stacked horizontal blocks (like the 3x3 blocks in `train_3`). Check if any of these blocks contain one or more rows consisting entirely of orange (7) pixels.\n2.  **Apply Block Removal Rule:** If such orange-row-containing blocks are found, construct the output grid by removing all rows belonging to those specific blocks and concatenating the remaining blocks vertically.\n3.  **Apply Crop and Cleanup Rule:** If the condition in step 2 is not met, but the grid contains orange (7) pixels:\n    a.  Identify the set of columns that constitute the \"rightmost contaminated region\". This region is likely the connected component of non-yellow (non-4) pixels that contains the orange pixel(s) with the largest column index. Determine the minimum column index (`c_min`) and maximum column index (`c_max`) spanned by this specific region.\n    b.  Create a preliminary output grid by taking only the columns from 0 up to (but not including) `c_min` from the original input grid.\n    c.  Refine the preliminary output grid: Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` in this cropped grid. Check the corresponding cell `(r, c)` in the *original* input grid.\n        i.  If the original cell `input[r][c]` was orange (7), set the output cell `output[r][c]` to yellow (4).\n        ii. If the original cell `input[r][c]` was blue (1) AND it had an orthogonal neighbor (up, down, left, or right) in the *original* input grid that was orange (7), set the output cell `output[r][c]` to yellow (4).\n        iii. Otherwise, keep the original color `input[r][c]` in the output cell `output[r][c]`.\n4.  **No Orange:** If the input grid contains no orange (7) pixels, the output is identical to the input.\n5.  **(Note on train_4):** This program is based on the patterns observed in `train_1`, `train_2`, and `train_3`. `train_4` does not fit this logic and may require a separate rule or represents an error in the task data."
