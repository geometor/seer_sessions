elements:
  - color: 7 (orange)
    role: background/fill, potentially transformable
  - color: 2 (red)
    role: static barrier
  - color: 6 (magenta)
    role: static barrier, also the target color for transformation
constants:
  - barrier_colors: [2, 6]
  - fill_color: 7
  - target_color: 6
objects:
  - type: barrier
    description: Pixels with colors red (2) or magenta (6) in the input grid.
    properties: Impassable, remain unchanged in the output.
  - type: fill_area
    description: Contiguous regions of orange (7) pixels in the input grid.
    properties: Can be transformed based on connectivity.
spatial_relationships:
  - relation: adjacency
    description: Pixels are adjacent if they share an edge (up, down, left, right). Diagonals are not considered adjacent for path finding.
  - relation: boundary_connectivity
    description: An orange pixel is connected to the boundary if there exists a path of adjacent orange pixels from it to any pixel on the grid's edge (row 0, max_row, col 0, max_col), without crossing any barrier pixel.
transformation:
  - type: conditional_color_change
    input_color: 7 (orange)
    output_color: 6 (magenta)
    condition: The orange pixel is NOT connected to the grid boundary (as defined above).
  - type: preservation
    colors: [2 (red), 6 (magenta)]
    condition: Pixels with these colors in the input retain their color and position in the output.
  - type: preservation
    colors: [7 (orange)]
    condition: The orange pixel IS connected to the grid boundary (as defined above).
