These shapes might contain some noise pixels within their boundaries.\n3.  **Noise:** A specific color acts as \"noise\" in each example (gray=5 in train_1 and train_2, orange=7 in train_3). These noise pixels are scattered throughout the grid, sometimes within or near the character objects.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output is a small grid (Nx4). Each row represents one identified character object from the input.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves:\n    *   Identifying the character objects and their primary colors.\n    *   Identifying the dominant noise color for the entire input grid.\n    *   Determining the vertical order of the character objects in the input.\n    *   Creating an output row for each character, consisting of its primary color followed by three cells filled with the identified noise color.\n    *   Stacking these rows vertically in the output grid, maintaining the original top-to-bottom order of the characters.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
