This gives the final output row order.\nIdentify the \"noise color\" for the grid. This is the most frequently occurring color in the input grid, excluding White(0) and the character colors identified. If there's a tie in frequency, choose the color with the smaller numerical value. If no such noise color exists, default to Gray(5).\nConstruct the output grid, which will have 4 columns and one row for each character color in the final order.\nFor each character color in the final order, at position `idx` (starting from 0):\n  a. Calculate the number of times the character color should repeat (`n_repeats`) after the first column:\n     * If this is the *last* color in the order *and* its index `idx` is 2 or greater, `n_repeats` is 3.\n     * Otherwise, `n_repeats` is equal to the index `idx`, but capped at a maximum of 3.\n  b. Create the output row: Start with the character color, followed by `n_repeats` copies of the character color, followed by `(3 - n_repeats)` copies of the noise color.\nAssemble these rows into the final output grid, maintaining the order determined.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef find_noise_color(grid: np.ndarray, character_colors: set) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the most frequent color in the grid, excluding background (0)\n    and the provided character colors.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input numpy array grid.\n        character_colors: A set of integers representing the colors identified as characters.\n\n    Returns:\n        The integer color value identified as the noise color.\n        Defaults to 5 (gray) if no suitable noise color is found.\n        Ties in frequency are broken by choosing the lower color value.\n    \"\"\"\n    counts = Counter(grid.flatten())\n\n    noise_candidate_counts = {}\n    for color, count in counts.items():\n        # Include only colors that are not background and not character colors\n        if color != 0 and color not in character_colors:\n            noise_candidate_counts[color] = count\n\n    if not noise_candidate_counts:\n        # No non-background, non-character colors found.
