            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous attempt correctly identified the core components: finding character colors, identifying a noise color, and generating a fixed-width output grid. The fill logic for the output rows was also mostly correct.\n\nThe primary error occurred in determining the **order** of rows in the output grid for the first training example. While the canonical order `[8, 1, 2, 4, 3]` filtered by present colors worked for examples 2 and 3, it failed for example 1, which required a swap between colors 2 (Red) and 3 (Green).\n\nThe secondary error was in the description of the fill logic, which was slightly off in the initial analysis but correctly implemented in the code. The code's fill logic successfully matched all examples *once the correct order was established*.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Refine the rule for determining the output row order to include the conditional swap observed in Train 1.\n2.  Verify that this refined ordering rule, combined with the previously implemented fill logic, consistently produces the correct output for all training examples.\n3.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect this revised understanding.\n\n## Metrics\n\nNo specific numerical metrics need recalculation via code execution at this stage. The issue identified is purely logical concerning the ordering and fill rules, which can be deduced by comparing the expected and actual outputs from the previous run.\n\n*   **Train 1 Failure:**\n    *   Expected Order: `[1, 3, 2]`\n    *   Code Produced Order: `[1, 2, 3]` (Based on filtering canonical `[8, 1, 2, 4, 3]`)\n    *   Fill Mismatch: Resulted from incorrect order applying the fill logic.\n*   **Train 2 & 3 Success:**\n    *   The filtered canonical order matched the expected output order.\n    *   The fill logic (`n_repeats = 3` if last and idx>=2 else `min(idx, 3)`) worked correctly with the correct order.\n\n## Updated YAML Facts\n\n"

Identify the set of \"character colors\" present in the input grid by checking which of the colors {Blue(1), Red(2), Green(3), Yellow(4), Azure(8)} exist in the input.\n2.  Determine the initial order of rows for the output grid by taking the canonical sequence `[Azure(8), Blue(1), Red(2), Yellow(4), Green(3)]` and keeping only the colors identified in step 1.\n3.  Apply a special ordering rule: If *neither* Azure(8) *nor* Yellow(4) were present in the input grid, *and* if both Red(2) and Green(3) *are* present, swap the positions of Red(2) and Green(3) in the order determined in step 2. This gives the final output row order.\n4.  Identify the \"noise color\" for the grid. This is the most frequently occurring color in the input grid, excluding White(0) and the character colors identified in step 1. If there's a tie in frequency, choose the color with the smaller numerical value. If no such noise color exists, default to Gray(5).\n5.  Construct the output grid, which will have 4 columns and one row for each character color in the final order determined in step 3.\n6.
