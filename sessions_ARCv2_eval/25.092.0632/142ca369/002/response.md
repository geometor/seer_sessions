**Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code correctly identified the core action: projecting diagonal lines downwards and to the right from each non-white source pixel. However, it failed to accurately implement the stopping condition. The results show that the generated lines continued even when they encountered coordinates that corresponded to non-white pixels in the *original input grid*. The lines should have terminated *before* reaching such coordinates.

The strategy is to modify the line-drawing logic to check, at each step of the diagonal projection (`nr`, `nc`), whether the corresponding cell in the *original input grid* (`input_grid[nr, nc]`) is non-white (value > 0). If it is, the line projection from the current source pixel must stop immediately *before* drawing at `(nr, nc)`. If `input_grid[nr, nc]` is white (value == 0), the pixel at `(nr, nc)` in the *output grid* can be colored, and the projection continues to the next diagonal step (`nr+1`, `nc+1`).

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Examples: 3
Grid_Size: Variable (e.g., 20x20, 18x18)
Colors: white(0), blue(1), red(2), green(3), yellow(4), gray(5), magenta(6), orange(7)

Input_Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous shapes or individual pixels.
  - Colors: Various non-white colors.
  - Property: Source for diagonal lines.
  - Persistence: All input objects remain unchanged in the output grid.

Output_Objects:
  - Includes all input objects.
  - Additional pixels forming diagonal lines originating from input pixels.

Actions:
  - Create an output grid identical to the input grid.
  - For each non-white pixel `P` at (`r`, `c`) with color `C` in the input grid:
    - Action: Emit a diagonal line trace.
    - Start_Trace_Position: (`r+1`, `c+1`).
    - Direction: Downwards and to the right (+1 row, +1 column per step).
    - Color: `C`.
    - Trace_Step: For current trace position (`tr`, `tc`):
      - Condition_Check: Examine the pixel at (`tr`, `tc`) in the *original input grid*.
      - If `input_grid[tr, tc]` is white (0):
          - Color the pixel at (`tr`, `tc`) in the *output grid* with color `C`.
          - Continue trace to (`tr+1`, `tc+1`).
      - If `input_grid[tr, tc]` is non-white (> 0):
          - Stop the trace for pixel `P` immediately. Do *not* color (`tr`, `tc`).
    - Termination_Condition_Boundary: Stop trace if `tr` or `tc` goes outside grid bounds.

Relationships:
  - Added diagonal lines originate *from* input non-white pixels.
  - The path of a diagonal line is constrained by grid boundaries and the positions of *other* non-white pixels in the *input grid*.
  - The final output grid combines the original input pixels and the correctly terminated diagonal line pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create an output grid initialized as an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (`r`, `c`) of the *input* grid.
3.  If the cell at (`r`, `c`) in the *input* grid contains a non-white color `C`:
    a.  Define the starting trace position: `trace_r = r + 1`, `trace_c = c + 1`.
    b.  Start a loop that continues as long as `trace_r` is less than the grid height AND `trace_c` is less than the grid width.
    c.  Inside the loop, check the cell at (`trace_r`, `trace_c`) in the *original input grid*.
    d.  If `input_grid[trace_r, trace_c]` is white (0):
        i.  Set the color of the cell at (`trace_r`, `trace_c`) in the *output* grid to `C`.
        ii. Update the trace position: `trace_r = trace_r + 1`, `trace_c = trace_c + 1`.
    e.  If `input_grid[trace_r, trace_c]` is *not* white (i.e., it belongs to an original object in the input):
        i.  Terminate the loop for the current source pixel (`r`, `c`) immediately (break out of the loop started in step 3b).
    f.  (Loop continues from step 3b if not terminated).
4.  After iterating through all source cells (`r`, `c`) in the input grid, return the final output grid.
