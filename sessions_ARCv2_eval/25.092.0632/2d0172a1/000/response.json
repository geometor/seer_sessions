There appears to be a dominant background color in each example (green, blue, yellow, red respectively).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output is also a 2D grid, generally smaller than the input grid.\n3.  **Color Preservation:** The colors present in the output grid are also present in the input grid. No new colors are introduced.\n4.  **Spatial Relationship:** The output grid appears to be a sub-section or crop of the input grid.\n5.  **Content Focus:** The cropping seems focused around the pixels that are *not* the dominant background color. The output grid tightly encloses all instances of these non-background pixels found in the input.\n6.  **Bounding Box:** The core operation looks like identifying all non-background pixels, calculating the smallest rectangular bounding box that encloses all of them, and then extracting that rectangular region from the input grid to form the output grid.\n\n**Facts (YAML Block):**\n\n"
