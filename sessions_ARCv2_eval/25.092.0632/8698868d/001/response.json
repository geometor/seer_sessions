Identify a second set of frames. \nPair frames from the first set (targets) with frames from the second set (sources) based on relative position. \nFor each target frame, replace its internal noise pixels with the color of its paired source frame. \nAssemble the modified target frames, maintaining their original relative spatial arrangement, to create the output grid.\n\nWorkflow:\n1. Find all distinct contiguous objects (non-background shapes) in the input grid.\n2. Determine the background/noise color (heuristically, often the most frequent color, or the color separating major objects).\n3. Categorize objects into 'targets' (those containing the noise color within their bounding box) and 'sources' (those that don't).\n4. Sort targets and sources based on their top-left corner positions (row, then column) to establish pairing.\n5. For each target-source pair:\n    a. Extract the target object's subgrid based on its bounding box.\n    b. Create a copy of the subgrid.\n    c. Replace all pixels matching the noise color within this copied subgrid with the source object's color.\n    d. Store the modified subgrid and its original relative position.\n6. Determine the layout and dimensions of the output grid based on the relative positions and sizes of the (modified) target subgrids.\n7.
