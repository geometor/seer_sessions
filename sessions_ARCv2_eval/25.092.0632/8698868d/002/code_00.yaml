task_description: Identify distinct colored shapes (frames) separated by a background/noise color. Group these frames into two sets (Targets and Sources) based on spatial arrangement and potentially other properties like noise presence or size. Pair Target frames with Source frames based on relative position within their groups. For each Target frame, replace pixels matching the noise color *within its bounding box* with the solid color of its paired Source frame. Assemble the modified Target frames into the output grid, maintaining their relative spatial arrangement.

noise_color_determination: Identify the color that acts as a separator between major shapes and also appears within the bounding boxes of some shapes but is not part of the shape itself. Heuristics like frequency and presence within other bounding boxes are useful.

object_identification: Find all contiguous blocks of non-noise color. Record their color, bounding box, pixel coordinates, and size.

grouping_and_pairing:
  - Identify all primary non-noise objects.
  - Divide these objects into two distinct groups (Group A = Targets, Group B = Sources). This division is based on spatial clustering (e.g., top vs. bottom half, quadrants) or potentially other distinguishing features if spatial clustering is ambiguous (like size difference between groups).
  - Ensure both groups have the same number of objects.
  - Identify Group A (Targets): This group typically contains the noise color within the bounding boxes of its constituent objects. In cases of ambiguity, the group with larger objects might be the target group (as seen in Example 2 analysis).
  - Pair objects: Match the i-th object in Group A (sorted by position) with the i-th object in Group B (sorted by position).

transformation_step:
  - For each pair (Target Object, Source Object):
    - Get the bounding box of the Target Object.
    - Create a temporary subgrid copy of the input grid corresponding to the Target's bounding box.
    - Identify the `filler_color` which is the main color of the Source Object.
    - Iterate through the pixels of the temporary subgrid. If a pixel's color matches the `noise_color`, change it to the `filler_color`.

assembly:
  - Determine the relative positions of the Target Objects from the input grid (e.g., based on their top-left corners).
  - Create a new output grid sized to fit all the modified target subgrids while maintaining their relative spatial layout.
  - Place each modified target subgrid onto the output grid at its calculated relative position.

example_1_details:
  - noise_color: azure (8)
  - non_noise_objects: blue(1), yellow(4), red(2), green(3)
  - grouping: Group A (Targets) = [blue(1), yellow(4)] (top group, contains noise in bbox). Group B (Sources) = [red(2), green(3)] (bottom group).
  - pairing: blue(1) <-> red(2), yellow(4) <-> green(3)
  - action: Fill noise (8) in blue bbox with red(2). Fill noise(8) in yellow bbox with green(3).
  - assembly: Arrange modified blue and yellow side-by-side.

example_2_details:
  - noise_color: red (2)
  - non_noise_objects: yellow(4), green(3), maroon(9), azure(8), blue(1)[mid], gray(5), blue(1)[bottom], orange(7)
  - grouping: Analysis suggests Group A (Targets) = [yellow(4), green(3), azure(8), blue(1)[mid]] (spatially first 4, larger size). Group B (Sources) = [maroon(9), orange(7), blue(1)[bottom], gray(5)] (these seem out of positional order based on simple sort - need a better grouping/sorting, perhaps quadrant based? The analysis identified these as sources based on size heuristic). Let's assume correct pairing is target-quadrant -> source-color: Q1(Yellow) -> Maroon(9), Q2(Green) -> Orange(7), Q3(Azure) -> Blue(1)[bottom], Q4(Blue[mid]) -> Gray(5). The analysis grouping might be incorrect. Revisit: The *actual* source colors (9, 7, 1, 5) correspond to the objects found later in the sort/lower down. The analysis 'size heuristic' correctly identified the first four sorted objects (4, 3, 9, 8) as targets *incorrectly* including 9, and the latter four (1, 5, 1, 7) as sources *incorrectly* including the target 1.
  - Revised Grouping for Example 2: Targets = [Yellow(4), Green(3), Azure(8), Blue(1)[mid]]. Sources = [Maroon(9), Orange(7), Blue(1)[bottom], Gray(5)]. Pairing needs to respect the 2x2 layout implicitly.
  - pairing (corrected): yellow(4) <-> maroon(9), green(3) <-> orange(7), azure(8) <-> blue(1)[bottom], blue(1)[mid] <-> gray(5). This requires matching relative positions within the target 2x2 grid and the source cluster.
  - action: Fill noise (2) in yellow bbox with maroon(9). Fill noise(2) in green bbox with orange(7). Fill noise(2) in azure bbox with blue(1). Fill noise(2) in blue[mid] bbox with gray(5).
  - assembly: Arrange modified targets in their original 2x2 relative layout.
