These objects are \nthen shifted horizontally. The direction of the shift (left or right) alternates \nfor each object when ordered top-to-bottom by their marker pixel, but this \nalternation is modified by the column parity of the marker pixel. The magnitude \nof the shift is specific to the marker/moved color pair.\n\nWorkflow:\n1. Determine the background color (most frequent color).\n2. Identify the task-specific marker color, moved color, and shift amount based \n   on the non-background colors present (e.g., Yellow(4)/Azure(8) -> shift 3, \n   Red(2)/Blue(1) -> shift 2). This identification is currently hardcoded based \n   on observed patterns in the training examples.\n3. Find all distinct contiguous objects composed primarily of non-background colors \n   that contain *both* the marker and moved colors using Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n4. For each identified object, find the top-most, left-most coordinate of a pixel \n   with the marker color.\n5. Sort these objects based on their marker pixel coordinates (first by row, then by column).\n6. Initialize the shift direction to 'Right' for the first object in the sorted list. \n   Keep track of the direction used for the previous object.\n7. Iterate through the sorted list of objects:\n    a. Determine the horizontal shift direction for the current object:\n       - If it's the first object, the direction is 'Right'.\n       - Otherwise, examine the column index of its marker pixel:\n         - If the column index is even, flip the direction used for the previous object \n           (Right becomes Left, Left becomes Right).\n         - If the column index is odd, use the same direction as the previous object.\n    b. Calculate the horizontal shift delta: +shift_amount for 'Right', -shift_amount for 'Left'.\n    c. Store the details for this move: the set of original coordinates, the calculated \n       set of new coordinates, and a mapping from original coordinates to their colors.\n       Check if the move is valid (stays within grid bounds).\n8. Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n9. Erase all original pixels of the validly moved objects from the output grid by setting \n   them to the background color. This is done first to avoid conflicts.\n10. Draw all pixels of the validly moved objects at their calculated new coordinates in the \n    output grid, using the colors stored earlier.\n11.
