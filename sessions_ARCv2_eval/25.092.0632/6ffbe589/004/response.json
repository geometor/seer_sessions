            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.\n\n**General Assessment & Strategy**\n\nThe initial hypothesis\u2014extracting the single largest contiguous non-white object\u2014correctly identified a key component in the examples, but failed because the desired output often includes multiple distinct objects or structures that are spatially related but not contiguous. The generated outputs in Examples 2 and 3 clearly show only the largest single component, while the expected outputs encompass a larger region containing that component plus others (the grey frame in Ex 2, the yellow checkerboard in Ex 3). Example 1's failure report is confusing, as the bounding box of the largest object *should* match the expected output; the reported \"Transformed Output\" might be erroneous, but the failures in Ex 2 and 3 clearly point towards needing a different approach.\n\nThe revised strategy is to identify *all* non-white pixels, potentially filter out very small \"noise\" objects, and then find the minimal bounding box that encloses all the *remaining* relevant pixels. We need to determine the precise rule for filtering noise. A threshold based on object size seems plausible.\n\n**Gather Metrics**\n\nLet's analyze the objects in each input and determine which ones contribute to the final bounding box. We'll use code execution to find all objects and their sizes.\n\n"
