**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The output grid generally resembles the input grid, with specific modifications.
2.  **Core Transformation:** The primary change involves filling regions of `white` (0) pixels within the input grid with a specific non-`white` color.
3.  **Identifying Regions to Fill:** The `white` regions that get filled appear to be "holes" â€“ contiguous areas of `white` pixels that are completely surrounded (including diagonals) by pixels of a single, uniform non-`white` color.
4.  **Determining Fill Color:** The color used to fill a hole depends on the color (`C`) of the surrounding pixels. There's a specific mapping rule:
    *   If the surrounding color `C` is Green (3), the fill color `F` is Green (3).
    *   If `C` is Orange (7), `F` is Orange (7).
    *   If `C` is Red (2), `F` is Orange (7).
    *   If `C` is Gray (8), `F` is Blue (1).
    *   If `C` is Yellow (4), the rule is conditional:
        *   If the grid is square (height equals width), the fill color `F` is determined by the grid dimension (Height / 2 or Width / 2). For example, in a 12x12 grid, F=6 (Magenta); in a 10x10 grid, F=5 (Gray).
        *   If the grid is not square, holes surrounded by Yellow (4) are *not* filled (remain `white` (0)).
5.  **No Other Changes:** Pixels that are not part of these fillable `white` holes remain unchanged from input to output. Shapes and other colored pixels retain their original positions and colors.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: Fill enclosed white regions based on surrounding color and grid properties.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  - element: pixel
    description: A single cell in the grid with a color value.
    properties:
      - color: Integer 0-9.
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
  - element: region
    description: A contiguous area of pixels of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: The uniform color of the pixels in the region.
      - connectivity: Pixels are connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (8-way adjacency).
  - element: hole
    description: A contiguous region of white (0) pixels.
    properties:
      - boundary_pixels: The set of non-white pixels directly adjacent (8-way) to the hole region.
      - surrounding_color_uniformity: Whether all boundary pixels share the same single color C.
      - surrounding_color: The uniform color C of the boundary pixels, if uniformity holds.

actions:
  - action: identify_holes
    description: Find all contiguous regions of white (0) pixels.
  - action: analyze_boundary
    description: For each white region, determine the set of adjacent non-white pixels and check if they are all of a single color C.
  - action: determine_fill_color
    description: Based on the surrounding color C and grid properties (shape and size), determine the fill color F according to specific rules.
  - action: fill_hole
    description: Change the color of all pixels within an identified hole region to the determined fill color F (if F is non-white).

relationships:
  - relationship: enclosure
    description: A white region is enclosed if all its adjacent non-white pixels have the same color C.
  - relationship: color_mapping
    description: A mapping exists between the surrounding color C and the fill color F.
    details:
      - C=2 (Red) -> F=7 (Orange)
      - C=3 (Green) -> F=3 (Green)
      - C=7 (Orange) -> F=7 (Orange)
      - C=8 (Gray) -> F=1 (Blue)
      - C=4 (Yellow) -> depends on grid shape/size
  - relationship: grid_property_dependency
    description: The fill rule for holes surrounded by Yellow (4) depends on whether the grid is square and its dimensions.
    details:
      - If grid is square (H=W), F = H / 2.
      - If grid is not square, F = 0 (no fill).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find all distinct contiguous regions of `white` (0) pixels in the input grid. Use 8-way adjacency (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections). Keep track of visited `white` pixels to process each region only once.
3.  For each `white` region found:
    a.  Identify all pixels that are adjacent (8-way) to any pixel within this `white` region.
    b.  From these adjacent pixels, collect only the ones that are *not* `white` (color > 0). Let this set be the `boundary_pixels`.
    c.  Check if the `boundary_pixels` set is non-empty and if all pixels in this set have the exact same color. Let this uniform color be `C`.
    d.  If such a uniform surrounding color `C` exists, determine the fill color `F` based on the following rules:
        i.  If `C` is Green (3), set `F` to Green (3).
