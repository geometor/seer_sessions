The output grid generally resembles the input grid, with specific modifications.\n2.  **Core Transformation:** The primary change involves filling regions of `white` (0) pixels within the input grid with a specific non-`white` color.\n3.  **Identifying Regions to Fill:** The `white` regions that get filled appear to be \"holes\" \u2013 contiguous areas of `white` pixels that are completely surrounded (including diagonals) by pixels of a single, uniform non-`white` color.\n4.  **Determining Fill Color:** The color used to fill a hole depends on the color (`C`) of the surrounding pixels. There's a specific mapping rule:\n    *   If the surrounding color `C` is Green (3), the fill color `F` is Green (3).\n    *   If `C` is Orange (7), `F` is Orange (7).\n    *   If `C` is Red (2), `F` is Orange (7).\n    *   If `C` is Gray (8), `F` is Blue (1).\n    *   If `C` is Yellow (4), the rule is conditional:\n        *   If the grid is square (height equals width), the fill color `F` is determined by the grid dimension (Height / 2 or Width / 2). For example, in a 12x12 grid, F=6 (Magenta); in a 10x10 grid, F=5 (Gray).\n        *   If the grid is not square, holes surrounded by Yellow (4) are *not* filled (remain `white` (0)).\n5.  **No Other Changes:** Pixels that are not part of these fillable `white` holes remain unchanged from input to output. Shapes and other colored pixels retain their original positions and colors.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
