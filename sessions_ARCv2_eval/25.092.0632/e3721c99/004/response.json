            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanism: using shapes defined in a 'key area' (above a blue separator line) to determine the color transformation of matching gray shapes in a 'work area' (below the separator). However, the provided code execution results show that the `transform` function returned the *original input grid* instead of the *modified output grid* for both training examples. This indicates a critical failure in the implementation of the color replacement step, despite the logic appearing sound in the provided code listing.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1. Re-verify the core logic components (separator identification, key/work area definition, object finding, shape normalization).\n2. Focus intently on the step where the output grid is modified. Ensure that the gray pixels corresponding to a matched shape are correctly overwritten with the key pattern's color in the `output_grid_np` copy.\n3. Use code execution to gather precise metrics about the objects and shapes involved in the examples to confirm assumptions.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nWe will use the provided Python functions (`find_objects`, `get_object_shape`) to analyze the training examples more thoroughly.\n\n*   **Example 1 Analysis:**\n    "

            "text": "**Analysis of Metrics Results:**\n\nThere's a significant discrepancy between the metrics results and the visual interpretation/expected behavior:\n\n1.  **Example 1:**\n    *   The code only found 3 key patterns (colors 4, 3, 2), missing the blue (1) pattern. *Correction:* Looking closely at the key area for Example 1, the blue shape is indeed different from the gray shapes below. My initial visual check was flawed. The code might be correct in identifying only 3 *used* key patterns. *Further Correction:* Ah, the `find_objects` correctly identified colors 4, 3, and 2. The blue shape `1` in the key area *is* visually present, but the code correctly ignores color `1` based on `key_colors = set(range(10)) - {0, 1}`. This means the blue shape in the key area is *not* intended as a pattern.\n    *   Crucially, the code reports **0** gray objects matching any key shape. This directly explains why the output was identical to the input \u2013 no replacements were triggered. This contradicts the visual evidence of the expected output, where gray shapes *are* replaced. This points to a potential issue in either `find_objects` (less likely given it finds objects) or `get_object_shape` (how shapes are normalized/compared) or the comparison logic itself. Let's re-examine the shapes. The gray shapes below *do* look like the key shapes above. Maybe the issue is subtle coordinate differences or the normalization method.\n\n2.  **Example 2:**\n    *   The code found 3 key patterns (colors 2, 3, 5). This is unexpected. Color 5 (gray) should not be a key pattern; keys are non-gray, non-background, non-separator colors above the line. *Correction:* Inspecting Example 2 input again, there *is* a gray shape (color 5) *above* the separator line at `(1, 18), (1, 19)`. The code correctly found this according to the rules given (`key_colors = set(range(10)) - {0, 1}`). This implies the rule \"key patterns are non-gray\" might be an incorrect assumption derived only from Example 1. The rule should be \"key patterns are any non-background, non-separator objects above the line\".\n    *   Similar to Example 1, the code reports **0** gray objects matching any key shape, explaining the failure. Again, this contradicts the expected output.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n\nThe core issue seems to be the shape matching failing. The `get_object_shape` function normalizes coordinates relative to the object's top-left pixel. This seems standard. The comparison `gray_shape in key_patterns` relies on the exact tuple representation of these relative coordinates matching. This should work.\n\nPossible failure points:\n1.  **Subtle Off-by-One Errors:** Could the coordinates captured by `find_objects` or normalized by `get_object_shape` be slightly off? (Unlikely if BFS is correct).\n2.  **Data Type Issues:** Could comparing tuples derived from `np.int64` coordinates cause issues? (Unlikely, Python handles tuple comparison robustly).\n3.  **Flaw in Premise:** Is the matching purely based on shape, or is there another factor (size, position relative to something, etc.)? The visual evidence strongly suggests shape matching is the key.\n4.  **Error in Metric Code Execution:** Is it possible the `tool_code` execution environment ran the code differently or had an error preventing matches?\n\nLet's stick to the shape-matching hypothesis and refine the definition and program, assuming the core comparison logic *should* work if shapes are correctly derived. The failure likely lies in *why* the shapes aren't matching when they visually appear to. For now, we will assume the provided `find_objects` and `get_object_shape` implementations are correct conceptually and focus on refining the description based on the *intended* logic seen in the examples. The implementation needs debugging.\n\n**Revised YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
