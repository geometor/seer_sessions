It contains distinct, relatively small shapes made of colors like yellow (4), green (3), blue (1), and red (2), separated from the lower part by a solid horizontal line (blue=1).\n3.  **Work Area:** The bottom portion of the grid, below the separator line, contains various shapes made of gray (5) pixels on a white (0) background.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation primarily affects the gray shapes in the work area. These gray shapes are replaced by colored shapes in the output.\n5.  **Color Replacement Logic:** The color used to replace a gray shape in the output corresponds to the color of a shape in the key area whose shape *exactly matches* the gray shape in the input.\n6.  **Preservation:** The key area, the separator line, and the white background pixels in the work area remain unchanged in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
