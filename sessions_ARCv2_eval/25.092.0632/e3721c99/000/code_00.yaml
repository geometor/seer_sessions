  grid_size: ثابت (30x30 in examples)
  background_color: white (0)
  separator:
    exists: True
    color: blue (1)
    type: horizontal_line
    location: separates grid into upper (key) and lower (work) areas
key_area:
  location: above separator line
  content: contains multiple distinct colored objects (key patterns) on background
  key_pattern_colors: [yellow (4), green (3), blue (1), red (2)] # colors vary per example
  purpose: provides shape-color mapping templates
work_area:
  location: below separator line
  input_content: contains target objects (gray=5) on background
  output_content: target objects are replaced by colors based on shape match with key patterns
target_objects:
  input_color: gray (5)
  location: work_area
  property: contiguous shape
action:
  type: shape-based_color_replacement
  input: gray objects in work_area
  output: colored objects in work_area
  rule: >
    Find each contiguous gray object in the work area.
    Compare its shape to the shapes of the key patterns in the key area.
    If a gray object's shape matches a key pattern's shape, replace the gray object's pixels with the color of the matching key pattern in the output grid.
