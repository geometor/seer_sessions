            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial code failed because the definition of \"shape\" and the matching logic were incorrect. The code identified contiguous blocks of a single color (e.g., all connected gray pixels) and tried to match their relative coordinates. However, the examples show that the relevant \"shape\" or \"pattern\" includes internal structures (pixels of the background color, white=0) within the object's overall footprint.\n\nThe comparison needs to be done not just on the set of colored pixels, but on the entire rectangular pattern within the bounding box of the object, including any internal background pixels.\n\nThe failure mode (transformed output being identical to input in the work area) indicates that the shape matching condition (`gray_shape in key_patterns`) consistently evaluated to false, preventing any color replacement.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  Redefine how \"patterns\" are identified and represented for both the key area and the work area. Instead of just collecting coordinates of the target color, find the bounding box of each contiguous object and extract the entire rectangular subgrid within that box. This subgrid, including internal background pixels, will serve as the pattern representation.\n2.  Modify the matching logic to compare these extracted subgrids (patterns).\n3.  Adjust the color replacement logic. When a match occurs, only the pixels corresponding to the *original target color* (gray=5) within the matched region in the work area should be replaced with the key pattern's primary color. Internal background pixels within the pattern must remain unchanged.\n\n**Gather Metrics**\n"
