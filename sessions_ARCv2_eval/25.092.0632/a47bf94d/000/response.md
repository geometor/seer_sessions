**Perception:**

The input grids contain various shapes and patterns made of different colors against a white background. The key elements undergoing transformation appear to be solid 3x3 squares composed of a single non-white color. Other shapes and patterns in the input seem to remain unchanged in the output. The core operation involves modifying the central pixel of these identified 3x3 squares. In examples 2 and 3, additional patterns appear in the output that were not present in the input, specifically in the lower part of the grid. These new patterns also consist of hollowed 3x3 squares, but their origin and color mapping relative to the input squares isn't immediately obvious or consistent across those two examples. The most consistent and directly observable transformation across all examples is the hollowing of the existing solid 3x3 squares.

General_Observation:
  - The primary, consistent transformation involves identifying solid 3x3 squares of a single color.
  - The center pixel of these identified squares is set to white (0).
  - Other pixels and shapes generally remain unchanged.
  - Examples 2 and 3 exhibit an additional phenomenon where new hollowed squares appear at the bottom, seemingly related to the colors of the squares hollowed at the top, but the exact rule for this secondary effect is unclear or inconsistent.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid, checking its potential as the top-left corner of a 3x3 square (i.e., check from row 0 to height-3 and column 0 to width-3).
3.  For each potential top-left corner (row `r`, column `c`):
    a.  Examine the 3x3 area starting at (`r`, `c`).
    b.  Check if all 9 pixels within this 3x3 area have the same, non-white color. Let this color be `C`.
    c.  If the 3x3 area is a solid square of color `C`, modify the pixel at the center of this square (position `r+1`, `c+1`) in the *output* grid, setting its color to white (0).
4.  Return the modified output grid.

*(Self-correction: The program above correctly describes the consistent hollowing action observed. It deliberately ignores the unexplained appearance of new patterns in the lower sections of examples 2 and 3, focusing on the transformation rule that applies reliably across all examples to existing objects.)*
