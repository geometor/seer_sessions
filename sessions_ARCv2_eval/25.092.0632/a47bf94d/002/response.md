**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code correctly identified the basic transformation pattern—hollowing out solid 3x3 squares—but failed for two main reasons:
1.  **Incorrect Object Identification:** The code hollowed out the center of *any* 3x3 block that was uniformly colored, including those that were part of larger solid shapes (e.g., the 4x4 maroon square in Ex 1 and Ex 3). The rule should only apply to squares that are *exactly* 3x3.
2.  **Incomplete Transformation:** The code only performed the "hollowing in place" action. The expected outputs clearly show that for each original solid 3x3 square identified and hollowed, a *new* hollow 3x3 square is also generated elsewhere in the grid. The location and color of this generated square appear to depend on the original square's color and position, and potentially on other elements or grid properties, in a way that was not captured and varies between examples.

**Strategy:**
1.  Refine the object identification step to find only *exact* 3x3 solid squares by checking their surrounding borders.
2.  Implement the two-part transformation:
    *   Hollow the identified exact 3x3 squares in place.
    *   Determine the rule for generating the *new* hollow squares (location and color) based on the original squares. This requires closer examination of the relationship between the input squares and the newly appearing output squares across all examples. Analyze the positional (row, column) and color mappings between the original solid squares and the generated hollow squares.

**Metrics and Analysis**

Let's re-examine the examples focusing on the discrepancies and the generation rule.
