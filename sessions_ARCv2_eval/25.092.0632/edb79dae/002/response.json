The core logic involving identifying a gray frame, deriving a color map from external key blocks, and transforming the content within the frame seems correct based on the examples.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n\n1.  Replace the `skimage` functions (`label`, `regionprops`) with custom implementations or equivalent numpy operations to find the largest connected component of gray pixels (the frame). A Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) approach is suitable for finding connected components.\n2.  Refine the method for identifying the color mapping pairs. Instead of scanning the entire area outside the frame, focus specifically on the region where these key blocks appear (observed to be the top-left area, specifically above the frame). Ensure the logic correctly pairs vertically adjacent, distinct, non-background, non-gray colors.\n3.  Verify assumptions about background colors (global vs. internal) and ensure they are handled correctly in the mapping process.\n4.  Update the Natural Language Program and Facts based on these refinements.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\n"
