            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple distinct regions. There's a large background area (azure 8 in train_1, azure 1 in train_2). There's a prominent rectangular frame made of gray (5) pixels. Inside this frame, there's a pattern composed of a few specific colors on a local background (which matches the main grid background). Outside the frame, typically in the top-left corner, there are several small, solid-colored rectangular blocks, often arranged in pairs.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is smaller than the input. It consists of a gray (5) border enclosing an inner area. The dimensions of the output grid match the dimensions of the gray frame identified in the input grid.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The central operation is extracting the content from *inside* the gray frame in the input and placing it into the *inside* of the output grid (within the gray border).\n4.  **Color Transformation:** The colors of the pixels extracted from inside the input frame are systematically changed when placed into the output grid. The background color inside the frame remains the same, but other colors are mapped to new colors.\n5.  **Mapping Rule:** The specific color mapping rule is not fixed but appears to be defined *contextually* within each input grid. The pairs of colored blocks located outside the gray frame (in the top-left) seem to define the mapping. Specifically, if a block of color `C1` is located directly above a block of color `C2`, then any pixel with color `C1` found *inside* the gray frame is transformed to color `C2` in the output grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Determine its bounding box (minimum and maximum row and column indices).\n2.  **Determine Output Size:** Calculate the height and width of the identified gray frame. These dimensions will be the height and width of the output grid.\n3.  **Identify Color Mapping Pairs:**\n    *   Examine the area of the input grid *outside* the gray frame's bounding box.\n    *   Identify all pairs of solid-colored, non-background rectangular blocks where one block is positioned directly above another distinct-colored block.\n    *   For each such vertical pair, record a mapping rule: `Color_Above -> Color_Below`. Store these rules (e.g., in a dictionary).\n4.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the dimensions determined in step 2.\n5.  **Draw Output Border:** Fill the perimeter (first/last row and first/last column) of the new output grid with gray (5).\n6.  **Map and Copy Content:**\n    *   Iterate through each pixel location `(r_in, c_in)` *inside* the bounding box of the gray frame in the input grid (i.e., excluding the frame pixels themselves).\n    *   Determine the corresponding inner location `(r_out, c_out)` in the output grid (e.g., `r_out = r_in - frame_min_row`, `c_out = c_in - frame_min_col`).\n    *   Get the color `C_in` of the input pixel at `(r_in, c_in)`.\n    *   Check if `C_in` exists as a key in the color mapping rules identified in step 3.\n        *   If yes, set the output pixel at `(r_out, c_out)` to the corresponding mapped color `C_out`.\n        *   If no (meaning it's likely the local background color inside the frame), keep the color unchanged and set the output pixel at `(r_out, c_out)` to `C_in`.\n7.  **Return Output:** The fully constructed output grid is the result."
