Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple distinct regions. There's a large background area (azure 8 in train_1, azure 1 in train_2). There's a prominent rectangular frame made of gray (5) pixels. Inside this frame, there's a pattern composed of a few specific colors on a local background (which matches the main grid background). Outside the frame, typically in the top-left corner, there are several small, solid-colored rectangular blocks, often arranged in pairs.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is smaller than the input. It consists of a gray (5) border enclosing an inner area. The dimensions of the output grid match the dimensions of the gray frame identified in the input grid.
3.  **Core Transformation:** The central operation is extracting the content from *inside* the gray frame in the input and placing it into the *inside* of the output grid (within the gray border).
4.  **Color Transformation:** The colors of the pixels extracted from inside the input frame are systematically changed when placed into the output grid. The background color inside the frame remains the same, but other colors are mapped to new colors.
5.  **Mapping Rule:** The specific color mapping rule is not fixed but appears to be defined *contextually* within each input grid. The pairs of colored blocks located outside the gray frame (in the top-left) seem to define the mapping. Specifically, if a block of color `C1` is located directly above a block of color `C2`, then any pixel with color `C1` found *inside* the gray frame is transformed to color `C2` in the output grid.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: Input Grid
    properties:
      - Contains a background color (variable across examples).
      - Contains a large rectangular frame object made of gray (5) pixels.
      - Contains content pixels inside the frame (foreground colors + local background color).
      - Contains small, solid-colored 'key' blocks outside the frame, often vertically paired.
  - item: Output Grid
    properties:
      - Dimensions match the dimensions of the gray frame in the input.
      - Has a border of gray (5) pixels.
      - Contains content pixels inside the border.
      - The background color inside the border matches the background color inside the input frame.
  - item: Gray Frame
    properties:
      - Largest connected component of gray (5) pixels.
      - Defines the bounding box for content extraction.
      - Its dimensions determine the output grid size.
      - Its color (gray 5) is used for the output grid border.
  - item: Key Blocks
    properties:
      - Located outside the gray frame (observed in top-left).
      - Solid rectangular blocks of single colors (non-background).
      - Vertical adjacency between blocks of different colors defines the color mapping rule.
      - Rule format: If color `C1` block is above color `C2` block, then map `C1 -> C2`.
  - item: Content Inside Frame
    properties:
      - Pixels located spatially within the bounds of the gray frame, excluding the frame itself.
      - Consists of a local background color and one or more foreground colors.
actions:
  - action: Identify Frame
    actor: system
    input: Input Grid
    output: Coordinates and dimensions of the gray (5) frame.
  - action: Determine Output Size
    actor: system
    input: Frame dimensions
    output: Output grid dimensions.
  - action: Identify Mapping Rules
    actor: system
    input: Input Grid (specifically, the area outside the frame)
    output: A set of color mapping pairs (C_input -> C_output).
    details: Find vertically adjacent, distinct, non-background color blocks. The upper color maps to the lower color.
  - action: Extract and Transform Content
    actor: system
    input: Input Grid (content inside frame), Color mapping rules
    output: Transformed content pixels.
    details: Iterate through pixels inside the input frame. If a pixel's color is a key in the mapping rules, change it to the corresponding value. If it's the local background color, keep it unchanged.
  - action: Construct Output Grid
    actor: system
    input: Output dimensions, Transformed content
    output: Final Output Grid.
    details: Create a grid of the determined size. Fill the border with gray (5). Fill the interior with the transformed content pixels, maintaining their relative positions.
relationships:
  - The output grid size is determined by the input grid's gray frame size.
  - The output grid's border color is the same as the input grid's frame color (gray 5).
  - The output grid's inner content is a transformed version of the input grid's inner content (within the frame).
  - The color transformation rules applied to the inner content are derived from the spatial relationships (vertical adjacency) of key blocks located outside the frame in the input grid.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Find the Frame:** Scan the input grid to locate the largest connected object composed entirely of gray (5) pixels. Determine its bounding box (minimum and maximum row and column indices).
2.  **Determine Output Size:** Calculate the height and width of the identified gray frame. These dimensions will be the height and width of the output grid.
3.  **Identify Color Mapping Pairs:**
    *   Examine the area of the input grid *outside* the gray frame's bounding box.
    *   Identify all pairs of solid-colored, non-background rectangular blocks where one block is positioned directly above another distinct-colored block.
    *   For each such vertical pair, record a mapping rule: `Color_Above -> Color_Below`. Store these rules (e.g., in a dictionary).
4.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the dimensions determined in step 2.
5.  **Draw Output Border:** Fill the perimeter (first/last row and first/last column) of the new output grid with gray (5).
6.  **Map and Copy Content:**
    *   Iterate through each pixel location `(r_in, c_in)` *inside* the bounding box of the gray frame in the input grid (i.e., excluding the frame pixels themselves).
    *   Determine the corresponding inner location `(r_out, c_out)` in the output grid (e.g., `r_out = r_in - frame_min_row`, `c_out = c_in - frame_min_col`).
    *   Get the color `C_in` of the input pixel at `(r_in, c_in)`.
    *   Check if `C_in` exists as a key in the color mapping rules identified in step 3.
        *   If yes, set the output pixel at `(r_out, c_out)` to the corresponding mapped color `C_out`.
        *   If no (meaning it's likely the local background color inside the frame), keep the color unchanged and set the output pixel at `(r_out, c_out)` to `C_in`.
7.  **Return Output:** The fully constructed output grid is the result.
