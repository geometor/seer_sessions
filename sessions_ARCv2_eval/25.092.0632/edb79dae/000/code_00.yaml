task_elements:
  - item: Input Grid
    properties:
      - Contains a background color (variable across examples).
      - Contains a large rectangular frame object made of gray (5) pixels.
      - Contains content pixels inside the frame (foreground colors + local background color).
      - Contains small, solid-colored 'key' blocks outside the frame, often vertically paired.
  - item: Output Grid
    properties:
      - Dimensions match the dimensions of the gray frame in the input.
      - Has a border of gray (5) pixels.
      - Contains content pixels inside the border.
      - The background color inside the border matches the background color inside the input frame.
  - item: Gray Frame
    properties:
      - Largest connected component of gray (5) pixels.
      - Defines the bounding box for content extraction.
      - Its dimensions determine the output grid size.
      - Its color (gray 5) is used for the output grid border.
  - item: Key Blocks
    properties:
      - Located outside the gray frame (observed in top-left).
      - Solid rectangular blocks of single colors (non-background).
      - Vertical adjacency between blocks of different colors defines the color mapping rule.
      - Rule format: If color `C1` block is above color `C2` block, then map `C1 -> C2`.
  - item: Content Inside Frame
    properties:
      - Pixels located spatially within the bounds of the gray frame, excluding the frame itself.
      - Consists of a local background color and one or more foreground colors.
actions:
  - action: Identify Frame
    actor: system
    input: Input Grid
    output: Coordinates and dimensions of the gray (5) frame.
  - action: Determine Output Size
    actor: system
    input: Frame dimensions
    output: Output grid dimensions.
  - action: Identify Mapping Rules
    actor: system
    input: Input Grid (specifically, the area outside the frame)
    output: A set of color mapping pairs (C_input -> C_output).
    details: Find vertically adjacent, distinct, non-background color blocks. The upper color maps to the lower color.
  - action: Extract and Transform Content
    actor: system
    input: Input Grid (content inside frame), Color mapping rules
    output: Transformed content pixels.
    details: Iterate through pixels inside the input frame. If a pixel's color is a key in the mapping rules, change it to the corresponding value. If it's the local background color, keep it unchanged.
  - action: Construct Output Grid
    actor: system
    input: Output dimensions, Transformed content
    output: Final Output Grid.
    details: Create a grid of the determined size. Fill the border with gray (5). Fill the interior with the transformed content pixels, maintaining their relative positions.
relationships:
  - The output grid size is determined by the input grid's gray frame size.
  - The output grid's border color is the same as the input grid's frame color (gray 5).
  - The output grid's inner content is a transformed version of the input grid's inner content (within the frame).
  - The color transformation rules applied to the inner content are derived from the spatial relationships (vertical adjacency) of key blocks located outside the frame in the input grid.
