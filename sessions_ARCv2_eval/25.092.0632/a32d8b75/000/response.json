            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grid is consistently divided into (at least) two main regions separated by a vertical magenta (6) line located at the 6th column (index 5).\n    *   **Key Region:** A 5x5 area in the top-left corner (rows 0-4, columns 0-4). This region contains a pattern made of two distinct non-white colors set against a white (0) background.\n    *   **Source Region:** The area to the right of the magenta line (columns 6 onwards). This region contains various shapes and areas composed of different colors.\n    *   **Separator:** The magenta (6) line itself.\n    *   **Other elements:** Sometimes other patterns or colors exist outside the 5x5 key but to the left of the separator line. These seem potentially relevant for determining the transformation rule but not directly part of the key pattern itself.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid's dimensions match the dimensions of the Source Region from the input. The content of the output grid is a modified version of the Source Region.\n3.  **Transformation Core Logic:** The 5x5 Key Region acts as a control mechanism dictating how a specific color within the Source Region is transformed.\n    *   The two non-white colors within the Key Region define *which* color in the Source Region will be targeted for replacement and *how* it will be replaced.\n    *   The replacement involves using a 3x3 pattern derived from the central 3x3 part of the Key Region.\n    *   This 3x3 pattern is tiled across all pixels of the target color in the Source Region to produce the output.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Examine the central 3x3 area within the 'key region' (`key_region[1:4, 1:4]`).\n    b.  Identify the two distinct non-white colors present in this central 3x3 area. Call them `Color1` and `Color2`.\n3.  **Determine Target Color:** Based on the pair (`Color1`, `Color2`), determine the `TargetColor` that will be replaced in the 'source region' using the following predefined mapping:\n    *   If the key colors are yellow (4) and orange (7), the `TargetColor` is green (3).\n    *   If the key colors are blue (1) and red (2), the `TargetColor` is azure (8).\n    *   If the key colors are green (3) and azure (8), the `TargetColor` is gray (5).\n4.  **Generate Replacement Pattern:**\n    a.  Create a new 3x3 grid called the 'replacement pattern'.\n    b.  For each cell in the central 3x3 area of the 'key region':\n        *   If the cell color is `Color1`, set the corresponding cell in the 'replacement pattern' to `Color2`.\n        *   If the cell color is `Color2`, set the corresponding cell in the 'replacement pattern' to `Color1`.\n        *   If the cell color is any other color (e.g., white), keep that color in the corresponding cell of the 'replacement pattern'.\n5.  **Transform Source:**\n    a.  Create the 'output grid' initially as an identical copy of the 'source region'.\n    b.  Iterate through every cell `(row, column)` of the 'output grid'.\n    c.  Check if the original color in the 'source region' at `(row, column)` was the `TargetColor`.\n    d.  If it was the `TargetColor`, update the 'output grid' at `(row, column)` with the color from the 'replacement pattern' at position `(row modulo 3, column modulo 3)`.\n6.  **Final Output:** The final 'output grid' is the result of the transformation."
