**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code failed on all three training examples. The core misunderstanding was in how the output grid is constructed, specifically concerning the pixels that do *not* match the `TargetColor`.

*   **Initial Incorrect Assumption:** The code assumed a single "background" color (determined by a potentially complex rule) filled the entire output grid initially, and then only the `TargetColor` pixels were overwritten with the `ReplacementPattern`.
*   **Revised Understanding (based on results):**
    1.  The transformation primarily involves replacing pixels of the `TargetColor` in the `SourceRegion` with the tiled `ReplacementPattern`.
    2.  The handling of *non*-`TargetColor` pixels depends on the `KeyColors`:
        *   If `KeyColors` are {blue(1), red(2)}, all non-`TargetColor` pixels in the `SourceRegion` are changed to azure(8) in the `OutputGrid`.
        *   For all other `KeyColor` pairs observed ({yellow(4), orange(7)} and {green(3), azure(8)}), the non-`TargetColor` pixels retain their original color from the `SourceRegion` in the `OutputGrid`.
*   **Strategy:** Modify the process:
    1.  Determine `KeyColors`, `TargetColor`, and `ReplacementPattern` as before.
    2.  Initialize the `OutputGrid`:
        *   If `KeyColors` are {1, 2}, create an `OutputGrid` of the same dimensions as the `SourceRegion`, filled entirely with azure(8).
        *   Otherwise, create the `OutputGrid` as a direct copy of the `SourceRegion`.
    3.  Iterate through the `SourceRegion` and the `OutputGrid` simultaneously. If a pixel at `(r, c)` in the `SourceRegion` matches the `TargetColor`, update the pixel at `(r, c)` in the `OutputGrid` using the tiled `ReplacementPattern` value `ReplacementPattern[r % 3][c % 3]`.

This revised strategy addresses the specific failure modes observed in each example.
