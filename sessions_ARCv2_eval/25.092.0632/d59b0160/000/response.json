Both input and output grids contain various small, scattered objects composed of different colors. The key difference between input and output is that many of these objects present in the input are removed (replaced by the orange background color) in the output. There is a consistent feature across all inputs: a horizontal line of four green (3) pixels located at row 3, columns 0 through 3. This green line object remains unchanged in all outputs. Observing the objects that remain versus those that are removed reveals a pattern related to proximity to this green line. Objects that are adjacent (sharing a side or a corner) with any part of the green line object are preserved in the output. All other objects, regardless of their color or shape, that are not adjacent to the green line are removed and replaced with the orange background color.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
