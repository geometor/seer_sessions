task_description: "Move specific rectangular objects horizontally based on their frame color, preserving the rest of the grid."
grid_properties:
  background_color:
    description: "The dominant color of the grid, determined from input and used for erasing."
    value_in_example_1: 0 # white
    value_in_example_2: 4 # yellow
    value_in_example_3: 1 # blue

    description: "Height and width remain constant between input and output."
    value_in_example_1: [22, 22]
    value_in_example_2: [22, 22] # Correction: width is 22, not 24 as initially thought
    value_in_example_3: [22, 22]
objects_to_move:
  - type: "Framed Rectangle"
    description: "A solid rectangle (core) surrounded by a 1-pixel thick frame."
    identification_criteria:
      - frame_color is azure (8) or red (2).
      - frame is exactly 1 pixel thick around the entire perimeter.
      - core is a solid rectangle of a single color, different from the frame and background.
      - object size (including frame) is at least 3x3.
    properties_persisted:
      - core_color: The color of the solid inner rectangle.
      - shape: The dimensions (height, width) of the object.
      - vertical_position: The top row index (min_r).
    action:
      description: "Translate the object horizontally, erasing its original position and drawing it at the new position, based on its frame color."
      rule:
        - if: "frame_color is azure (8)"
          then: "Move the object left until its leftmost column is 0."
        - if: "frame_color is red (2)"
          then: "Move the object right until its rightmost column matches the grid's width - 1."
static_elements:
  description: "All pixels in the input grid that are *not* part of an identified 'Framed Rectangle' object."
  action: "Preserve these pixels in their original positions in the output grid."
output_grid_construction:
  steps:
    - "Create an initial output grid as an identical copy of the input grid."
    - "Identify all 'Framed Rectangle' objects in the input grid."
    - "For each identified object:"
    - "  Erase the object from the output grid by filling its original bounding box with the background color."
    - "  Calculate the object's new horizontal position based on its frame color."
    - "  Draw the object (using its original pixel data) at the new position on the output grid."
