            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial code (`code_00.py`) attempted to implement the core logic: identify framed objects and move them horizontally based on frame color. However, the results show significant errors across all training examples. The `Transformed Output` differs substantially from the `Expected Output`, indicating flaws in object identification, background handling, or the movement/placement process.\n\nKey observations from the failed results:\n1.  **Background Corruption:** Pixels belonging to the original background or static elements appear to be incorrectly modified or erased, especially in areas where objects were originally located. This strongly suggests the strategy of copying the input grid and then erasing/redrawing objects is problematic.\n2.  **Incomplete Movement:** Some objects are not moved to their correct final positions (leftmost/rightmost edge).\n3.  **Object Misidentification/Partial Modification:** It seems the object identification might be capturing incorrect areas or the drawing process is overwriting parts of objects.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Ensure the `find_objects` function strictly adheres to the definition: a perfect rectangular frame (1-pixel thick) of color 2 or 8, enclosing a solid core of a single *different* color (not background, not frame color), with minimum dimensions of 3x3. The current BFS and validation logic needs review.\n2.  **Revise Transformation Logic:** Instead of modifying a copy of the input, the `transform` function should:\n    *   Initialize the `output_grid` filled entirely with the determined `background_color`.\n    *   Identify *all* valid objects and their original pixel data (`subgrid`) and bounding boxes.\n    *   For *each* identified object, calculate its *new* target position (top-left corner) based on the frame color rule (azure -> left edge, red -> right edge, vertical position unchanged).\n    *   Draw the object's original `subgrid` onto the clean `output_grid` at the *new* target position. This ensures only the moved objects appear, preserving the background implicitly.\n3.  **Verify Background Color Detection:** Ensure the background color is correctly identified, as it's crucial for initializing the output and validating object cores. Using the top-left pixel seems reasonable but could fail if an object touches that corner; a more robust method might be needed if examples show this (e.g., finding the most frequent color).\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's analyze the structure and discrepancies programmatically.\n"
