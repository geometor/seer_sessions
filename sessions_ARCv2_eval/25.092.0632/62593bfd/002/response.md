**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified that the task involves rearranging objects based on background color. However, the specific rearrangement rule (moving objects to corners) derived primarily from the first example did not generalize correctly to the second example, leading to significant pixel mismatches. The errors indicate that the core transformation logic needs revision. Both examples show that objects retain their shape and only change position. The key is to correctly determine the target position based on the background color and the object's properties.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Object Analysis:** Use code execution to accurately identify all non-background objects in both the input and output grids for each training example. Extract properties like color, bounding box, shape (relative pixel coordinates), and exact position (top-left corner coordinates).
2.  **Map Transformations:** For each object in each example, calculate the precise translation vector (change in row, change in column) required to move it from its input position to its output position.
3.  **Identify Unified Pattern:** Analyze the calculated transformations across both examples, looking for a consistent rule based on the input grid's background color and the object's color. Discard the previous corner-placement hypothesis.
4.  **Refine Program:** Update the natural language program to describe the newly discovered transformation rule.
