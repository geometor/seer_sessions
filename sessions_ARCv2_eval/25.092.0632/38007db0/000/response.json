This separator color also forms the border of each subgrid.\n3.  **Subgrid Content:** Each subgrid contains an internal pattern distinct from the separators/borders.\n4.  **Transformation:** The output grid seems to be a vertical slice of the input grid. Specifically, it corresponds exactly to the rightmost column of subgrids from the input.\n5.  **Dimensions:** The height of the output grid is identical to the height of the input grid. The width of the output grid is identical to the width of a single subgrid in the input.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Determine the total width (`iw`) of the input grid.\n3.  Calculate the starting column index (`start_col`) for the rightmost subgrid column by subtracting the subgrid width (`sw`) from the total input width (`iw`): `start_col = iw - sw`.\n4.  Extract the portion of the input grid that includes all rows and the columns from `start_col` up to (but not including) `iw`.\n5.  The extracted portion is the final output grid."
