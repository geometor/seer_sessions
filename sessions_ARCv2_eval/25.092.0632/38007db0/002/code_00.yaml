Examples:
  - Input:
      GridType: Input Matrix
      Structure: Composed of repeating 7x7 subgrids arranged in a 3x3 pattern.
      SeparatorColor: Blue (1)
      Dimensions: 19x19
    Output:
      GridType: Output Matrix
      Structure: A single column of 3 subgrids, modified from input.
      Dimensions: 19x7
      Modification: Colors Yellow (4) and Magenta (6) are swapped compared to the rightmost input subgrid column.
  - Input:
      GridType: Input Matrix
      Structure: Composed of repeating 7x7 subgrids arranged in a 3x4 pattern.
      SeparatorColor: Green (3)
      Dimensions: 19x25
    Output:
      GridType: Output Matrix
      Structure: A single column of 3 subgrids, modified from input.
      Dimensions: 19x7
      Modification: Colors Blue (1) and Yellow (4) are swapped compared to the rightmost input subgrid column.

DerivedGeneralizations:
  - Object: Input Grid, Output Grid, Subgrids, Separator Lines, Internal Colors
  - Properties:
      - Input grid has width (`iw`), height (`ih`), and `SeparatorColor`.
      - Input grid is tiled with repeating subgrids of width (`sw`) and height (`sh`).
      - Output grid has height `ih` and width `sw`.
  - Actions: Extraction, Identification, Swapping
  - Relationship:
      - A temporary grid is extracted from the input grid, corresponding to the rightmost `sw` columns.
      - The unique colors within this temporary grid, excluding the `SeparatorColor`, are identified. Let these be `InternalColor1` and `InternalColor2`.
      - The final output grid is created by taking the temporary grid and replacing all instances of `InternalColor1` with `InternalColor2`, and all instances of `InternalColor2` with `InternalColor1`.
