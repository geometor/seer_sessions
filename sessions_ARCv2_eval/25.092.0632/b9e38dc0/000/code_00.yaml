task_description: Identify a background color, a fill color, and barrier colors in the input grid. Perform a flood fill starting from the initial fill color pixels, replacing adjacent background color pixels with the fill color, stopping at barrier colors and grid edges.

definitions:
  - name: background_color
    description: The most frequent color in the input grid. This color is subject to being replaced by the fill color.
  - name: fill_color
    description: The color that initiates the fill operation and expands into the background. Identified by observing which color increases its area significantly in the output compared to the input, replacing the background color.
  - name: barrier_colors
    description: Any color present in the input grid that is neither the background color nor the fill color. These colors remain unchanged and block the fill propagation.
  - name: fill_seeds
    description: All pixels in the input grid that have the fill_color.
  - name: fill_operation
    description: A process starting from fill_seeds that iteratively changes adjacent (non-diagonal) background_color pixels to the fill_color.
  - name: stopping_conditions
    description: The fill_operation stops propagating into a pixel if that pixel is a barrier_color, already the fill_color, or outside the grid boundaries.

examples:
  - train_1:
      background_color: blue (1)
      fill_color: maroon (9)
      barrier_colors: [green (3), gray (5)]
      action: Flood fill starts from the single maroon pixel, replacing adjacent blue pixels with maroon until green, gray, or grid boundaries are met.
  - train_2:
      background_color: white (0)
      fill_color: yellow (4)
      barrier_colors: [gray (5)]
      action: Flood fill starts from the single yellow pixel, replacing adjacent white pixels with yellow until gray or grid boundaries are met.
  - train_3:
      background_color: orange (7)
      fill_color: green (3)
      barrier_colors: [magenta (6), maroon (9), azure (8)]
      action: Flood fill starts from all initial green pixels, replacing adjacent orange pixels with green until magenta, maroon, azure, or grid boundaries are met.
