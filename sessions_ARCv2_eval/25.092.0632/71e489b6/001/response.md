    Transforms the input grid based on the following rule:
    1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2. Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
    3. If a pixel is black (0), check its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right).
    4. If none of the cardinal neighbors are black (0), the black pixel is considered "isolated".
    5. For each isolated black pixel, find its cardinal neighbors in the input grid that are white (1).
    6. Change the color of these corresponding white neighbors in the output grid to orange (7).
    7. All other pixels, including the isolated black pixels, retain their original color in the output grid.
