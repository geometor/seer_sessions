Each grid has a dominant background color.\n2.  **Objects:** There are two main types of objects placed on the background:\n    *   **Plus-signs:** These are cross-like shapes, consistently 13 pixels in size (a 5x5 bounding box with the corners missing, forming a central cross). They appear in various colors.\n    *   **Bars:** These are 5-pixel line segments, either 1x5 horizontal or 5x1 vertical. In the examples, there are always exactly two bars present: one Red (2) and one Green (3).\n3.  **Transformation Goal:** The core goal is to selectively modify or remove some of the plus-sign objects based on the configuration of the Red and Green bars, and to remove the bars entirely. The background color remains unchanged.\n4.  **Key Transformation Logic:**\n    *   The bars (Red and Green) act as control signals; they are themselves removed in the output.\n    *   The relative horizontal position of the Red bar versus the Green bar determines *which* plus-sign colors are targeted for modification or removal.\n    *   Targeted plus-signs either change color to Gray (5) or are removed (changed to the background color).\n    *   One specific rule involves finding the *topmost* instance of a plus-sign of a particular color for removal.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
