Identifies the background color as the most frequent color in the input grid.\n2.  Finds all contiguous objects (connected components) of non-background colors using Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n3.  From the found objects, specifically identifies:\n    a.  A single Red (2) bar object (defined as a 5-pixel object with dimensions 1x5 or 5x1).\n    b.  A single Green (3) bar object (defined similarly).\n    c.  All plus-sign shaped objects (defined as 13-pixel objects forming a cross within a 5x5 bounding box, excluding the corners). These are categorized by their color (Maroon(9), Magenta(6), Green(3), or others).\n4.  Determines the relative horizontal position of the Red bar compared to the Green bar by comparing their minimum column indices (leftmost pixel).\n5.  Based on this relative position, selects a target plus-sign color and a modification mode:\n    a.  If the Red bar is to the left of the Green bar:\n        i.  If any Maroon (9) plus-signs exist, target Maroon with 'all' mode (modify all Maroon plus-signs).\n        ii. Else if any Green (3) plus-signs exist, target Green with 'topmost' mode (modify only the highest Green plus-sign).\n    b.  If the Red bar is to the right of (or at the same horizontal position as) the Green bar:\n        i.  If any Magenta (6) plus-signs exist, target Magenta with 'all' mode.\n        ii. Else if any Green (3) plus-signs exist, target Green with 'topmost' mode.\n6.  Creates the output grid by:\n    a.  Initializing it as a copy of the input grid.\n    b.  Removing the Red and Green bars by changing their constituent pixels to the background color in the output grid.\n    c.  Modifying the targeted plus-signs in the output grid:\n        i.  If the mode is 'all', change all pixels of all plus-signs matching the target color to Gray (5).\n        ii. If the mode is 'topmost', find the single plus-sign of the target color with the minimum top-row index and change its pixels to Gray (5).\n7.  Returns the modified grid. If the required Red or Green bars are not found, returns the original input grid unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid, background_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all connected components (objects) of non-background colors in the grid using BFS.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        background_color (int): The background color.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an object\n              and contains 'color' (int) and 'pixels' (set of (row, col) tuples).\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            #
