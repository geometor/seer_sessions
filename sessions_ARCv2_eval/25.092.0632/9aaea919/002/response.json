            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core components: background color, plus-sign objects, and Red/Green bar objects acting as controls. The shape recognition for bars (5 pixels, 1x5 or 5x1) and plus-signs (13 pixels, 5x5 bounding box minus corners) seems appropriate. The core transformation involves removing the bars and modifying specific plus-sign objects based on the relative horizontal position of the bars.\n\nThe primary issue appears to be an incomplete or incorrect deduction of the conditional logic governing *which* plus-signs are modified and *how*. The timeout error in the previous attempt prevents direct comparison of outputs, suggesting either an inefficiency in the object detection/processing loop or a potential edge case causing excessive computation. The strategy going forward is to refine the conditional logic based on all three examples and ensure the implementation is reasonably efficient.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nBased on visual inspection and re-evaluation of the three training examples:\n\n1.  **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Background: Orange (7)\n    *   Objects: Multiple plus-signs (Maroon-9, White-0, Blue-1, Yellow-4), one Red-2 bar (vertical), one Green-3 bar (vertical).\n    *   Bar Positions: Red bar (col 3) is left of Green bar (col 16).\n    *   Transformation: Red/Green bars removed. Both Maroon (9) plus-signs changed to Gray (5). Other plus-signs remain.\n    *   Implied Rule: If Red left of Green, target Maroon (9). Change *all* targeted plus-signs to Gray (5).\n\n2.  **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Background: Blue (1)\n    *   Objects: Multiple plus-signs (White-0, Azure-8, Yellow-4, Magenta-6), one Red-2 bar (vertical), one Green-3 bar (vertical).\n    *   Bar Positions: Red bar (col 21) is right of Green bar (col 3).\n    *   Transformation: Red/Green bars removed. The single Magenta (6) plus-sign changed to Gray (5). Other plus-signs remain.\n    *   Implied Rule: If Red right of Green, check for Magenta (6). If found, target Magenta. Change *all* targeted plus-signs to Gray (5).\n\n3.  **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Background: Magenta (6)\n    *   Objects: Multiple plus-signs (Red-2, Green-3, Orange-7, White-0), one Red-2 bar (vertical), one Green-3 bar (vertical). Note: One Red and one Green plus-sign, *distinct* from the bars.\n    *   Bar Positions: Red bar (col 10) is left of Green bar (col 16).\n    *   Transformation: Red/Green bars removed. The *topmost* Green (3) plus-sign changed to Gray (5). Other plus-signs (including the other Green plus-sign) remain.\n    *   Implied Rule refinement: If Red left of Green *and* no Maroon (9) plus-signs exist, target Green (3). Change only the *topmost* targeted plus-sign to Gray (5).\n\n**Revised Combined Logic:**\n\n*   The Red (2) and Green (3) bars determine the action.\n*   If the Red bar is horizontally to the left of the Green bar:\n    *   Check if any Maroon (9) plus-signs exist.\n        *   If yes, change *all* Maroon plus-signs to Gray (5).\n        *   If no, check if any Green (3) plus-signs exist.\n            *   If yes, change the *topmost* Green plus-sign to Gray (5).\n*   If the Red bar is horizontally to the right of the Green bar:\n    *   Check if any Magenta (6) plus-signs exist.\n        *   If yes, change *all* Magenta plus-signs to Gray (5).\n        *   If no, check if any Green (3) plus-signs exist.\n            *   If yes, change the *topmost* Green plus-sign to Gray (5).\n*   In all cases, remove the Red and Green bars (change their pixels to the background color).\n\nThe timeout issue needs addressing, potentially by ensuring object detection is efficient and avoiding redundant searches. The `find_objects` function itself seems standard; the overhead might come from multiple passes or inefficient checks within the main transform logic.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
