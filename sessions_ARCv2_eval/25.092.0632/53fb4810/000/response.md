*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
    *   The background color is consistently 'azure' (8).
    *   The grids contain various shapes and patterns made of different colors.
    *   In both examples, there is a single 'red' (2) pixel and a single 'yellow' (4) pixel that appear somewhat isolated from larger structures of the same color in the input. These specific pixels are absent in the output.
    *   In the output grids, a new vertical line pattern appears, composed of alternating 'red' (2) and 'yellow' (4) pixels.
    *   The position (column) and vertical extent (end row) of this new line pattern seem related to the positions of the input's isolated 'red' and 'yellow' pixels.
    *   The order of colors in the alternating pattern also seems determined by the relative positions (specifically, the column index) of the input's isolated 'red' and 'yellow' pixels.
    *   Other shapes and patterns in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid, except where they are overwritten by the new vertical pattern.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      grid_size: Constant between input and output.
      background_color: 8 (azure).
      input_features:
        - type: Objects/Shapes
          description: Various contiguous groups of non-background colors.
        - type: Specific Pixels
          description: Presence of a 'red' (2) pixel with no adjacent 'red' neighbors.
          property: location (row_red, col_red)
        - type: Specific Pixels
          description: Presence of a 'yellow' (4) pixel with no adjacent 'yellow' neighbors.
          property: location (row_yellow, col_yellow)
      output_features:
        - type: Objects/Shapes
          description: Most input objects/shapes are preserved.
        - type: Specific Pixels Removed
          description: The specific 'red' and 'yellow' pixels identified in the input are replaced with the background color.
        - type: New Pattern
          description: A vertical line pattern is introduced.
          location:
            column: Determined by the minimum column index between the specific 'red' and 'yellow' input pixels. Let this be target_col.
            start_row: 0
            end_row: Determined by the row index of the specific pixel (red or yellow) that defined the target_col. Let this be target_row.
          composition:
            colors: Alternating sequence of 'red' (2) and 'yellow' (4).
            order: Starts with the color of the specific pixel (red or yellow) that defined the target_col.
    transformation_rule:
      - Identify the locations of the unique 'red' pixel (r_red, c_red) and 'yellow' pixel (r_yellow, c_yellow) that have no neighbors of the same color.
      - Determine the target column (target_col), target row (target_row), and starting color (color_A) based on which of these pixels has the smaller column index. The other color becomes color_B.
      - Create a copy of the input grid.
      - Overwrite the target column from row 0 to target_row with an alternating pattern of color_A and color_B.
      - Replace the original identified 'red' and 'yellow' pixels at (r_red, c_red) and (r_yellow, c_yellow) with the background color (8).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Define the background color as 'azure' (8).
    3.  Scan the input grid to find the coordinates `(r_red, c_red)` of a 'red' (2) pixel that has no 'red' pixels in any of its 8 neighboring cells (including diagonals). Assume exactly one such pixel exists.
    4.  Scan the input grid to find the coordinates `(r_yellow, c_yellow)` of a 'yellow' (4) pixel that has no 'yellow' pixels in any of its 8 neighboring cells (including diagonals). Assume exactly one such pixel exists.
    5.  Compare the column indices `c_red` and `c_yellow`.
    6.  If `c_red` is less than or equal to `c_yellow`:
        a.  Set the target column `target_col = c_red`.
        b.  Set the target ending row `target_row = r_red`.
        c.  Set the first pattern color `color_A = 2` (red).
        d.  Set the second pattern color `color_B = 4` (yellow).
    7.  Else (if `c_yellow` is less than `c_red`):
        a.  Set the target column `target_col = c_yellow`.
        b.  Set the target ending row `target_row = r_yellow`.
        c.  Set the first pattern color `color_A = 4` (yellow).
        d.  Set the second pattern color `color_B = 2` (red).
    8.  Iterate through the rows from `row = 0` up to and including `target_row`.
    9.  For each `row`:
        a.  If `row` is even (0, 2, 4,...), set the pixel in the output grid at `(row, target_col)` to `color_A`.
        b.  If `row` is odd (1, 3, 5,...), set the pixel in the output grid at `(row, target_col)` to `color_B`.
    10. Set the pixel in the output grid at the original location `(r_red, c_red)` to the background color (8).
    11. Set the pixel in the output grid at the original location `(r_yellow, c_yellow)` to the background color (8).
    12. The final output grid is the modified grid.
