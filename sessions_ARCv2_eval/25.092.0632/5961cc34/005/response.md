"""
Transforms an input grid based on the number and location of connected components 
formed by blue (1) and green (3) pixels ("pattern objects").

1. Initialize the output grid with the background color (azure, 8).
2. Find all connected components consisting of blue (1) or green (3) pixels. 
   Connectivity is defined by adjacent (non-diagonal) cells. Blue and green 
   pixels are considered connected to each other. Count these components.
3. If exactly one component is found:
   a. Locate the column index of the single yellow (4) marker pixel.
   b. Fill this entire column in the output grid with red (2).
4. If more than one component is found:
   a. Determine the overall minimum bounding box that encompasses *all* the 
      pattern objects found.
   b. Fill the area within this single encompassing bounding box in the output 
      grid with red (2).
5. If zero pattern objects are found, the output grid remains the background color.
6. Return the modified output grid.
