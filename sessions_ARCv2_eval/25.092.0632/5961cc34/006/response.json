However, it fails when there are multiple pattern objects. The function currently calculates the single bounding box encompassing *all* pattern objects and fills that entire rectangle. The expected outputs for examples 2, 3, and 4 clearly show that the transformation should instead fill the individual bounding box of *each* pattern object separately. The strategy is to modify the logic for handling multiple objects to iterate through each identified pattern object, calculate its individual bounding box, and fill only that specific rectangular area in the output grid.\n\n**Metrics:**\n"
