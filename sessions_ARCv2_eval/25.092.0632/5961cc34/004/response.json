            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The initial hypothesis worked correctly for the first training example where there was only one pattern object. However, it failed for examples 2, 3, and 4, all of which contained multiple pattern objects (four in example 2, three in examples 3 and 4). The generated output for these cases involved filling the individual bounding boxes of each pattern object. By contrast, the expected output fills a larger, single rectangular area that encompasses *all* the pattern objects. This suggests the rule for multiple objects should involve calculating the bounding box of the *union* of all pattern objects, rather than filling each object's bounding box separately. The strategy is to verify this \"union bounding box\" hypothesis against the failed examples and update the logic accordingly.\n\n*   **Metrics and Analysis:**\n\n    Let's analyze the failed examples (2, 3, 4) to confirm the \"union bounding box\" hypothesis. We need to find the pattern objects, their individual bounding boxes, and the overall bounding box encompassing all of them.\n\n    **Example 2:**\n    *   Input contains 4 pattern objects (blue/green components).\n    *   Expected output fills a single rectangle with red (2).\n"
