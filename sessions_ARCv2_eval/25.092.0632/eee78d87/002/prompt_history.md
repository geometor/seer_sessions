Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids are consistently 6x6. They feature a dominant background color (orange, 7) and a smaller pattern made of a single different color (green, blue, or magenta in the examples).
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are consistently 16x16. They have a white (0) background and a repeating grid pattern. This pattern consists of 2x2 blocks separated by single lines of white pixels. There are 5 such blocks horizontally and 5 vertically, creating a 5x5 grid of these 2x2 blocks.
3.  **Base Pattern Generation:** The color used for the 2x2 blocks in the output grid seems to be determined by the background color of the input grid. In all examples, the input background is orange (7), and the output 2x2 blocks are also orange (7).
4.  **Overlay Pattern:** A fixed pattern of maroon (9) pixels is overlaid onto the base output grid *if* the input grid contains any pixel that is *not* the background color. The shape, color, or position of these non-background input pixels doesn't alter the maroon pattern itself, only its presence or absence.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation involves two main steps:
    *   Generating a base 16x16 grid patterned with 2x2 blocks whose color matches the input background color, separated by white lines.
    *   Conditionally overlaying a predefined maroon pattern if the input contains any non-background color pixels.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input Properties:
  - Grid Size: 6x6
  - Background Color: Dominant color in the grid (Orange=7 in examples).
  - Foreground Object: Present if any pixel color differs from the background color.
  - Foreground Properties: Color and shape vary but seem irrelevant to the output pattern beyond their existence.

Output Properties:
  - Grid Size: 16x16
  - Base Pattern:
      - Background: White (0)
      - Structure: A 5x5 arrangement of 2x2 blocks separated by single white lines (rows/cols 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 are white).
      - Block Color: Matches the background color of the input grid.
  - Conditional Overlay:
      - Trigger: Presence of any non-background pixel in the input grid.
      - Overlay Color: Maroon (9)
      - Overlay Pattern: A fixed, specific pattern centered within the 16x16 grid. The exact coordinates are:
          - Rows 5, 10: Cols 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
          - Rows 6, 9: Cols 5, 8, 11
          - Rows 7, 8: Cols 6, 7, 9, 10

Transformation Rule:
  - Step 1: Identify the background color of the input grid.
  - Step 2: Generate a 16x16 base grid with a pattern of 5x5 blocks (each 2x2) using the identified background color, separated by white lines.
  - Step 3: Check if the input grid contains any pixel whose color is different from the background color.
  - Step 4: If such a pixel exists, overlay the fixed maroon pattern onto the base grid. Otherwise, the base grid is the final output.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the background color of the input grid (the most frequent color).
2.  Create a new 16x16 grid, initially filled with white (0).
3.  Generate a base pattern on the 16x16 grid: For each cell (row `r`, column `c`), if both `(r mod 3)` and `(c mod 3)` are not equal to 0, set the cell's color to the input background color. This creates a 5x5 grid of 2x2 blocks of the background color, separated by white lines.
4.  Scan the input grid to determine if any pixel has a color different from the background color identified in step 1.
5.  If at least one non-background pixel exists in the input grid, modify the 16x16 output grid by drawing the following fixed pattern using maroon (9):
    *   Set pixels `(5, 6)` through `(5, 10)` to maroon.
    *   Set pixels `(10, 6)` through `(10, 10)` to maroon.
    *   Set pixels `(6, 5)`, `(6, 8)`, `(6, 11)` to maroon.
    *   Set pixels `(9, 5)`, `(9, 8)`, `(9, 11)` to maroon.
    *   Set pixels `(7, 6)`, `(7, 7)`, `(7, 9)`, `(7, 10)` to maroon.
    *   Set pixels `(8, 6)`, `(8, 7)`, `(8, 9)`, `(8, 10)` to maroon.
6.  The resulting 16x16 grid is the final output.

"""
Transforms a 6x6 input grid into a 16x16 output grid based on the following rules:
1. Determines the background color of the input grid (the most frequent color).
2. Creates a 16x16 output grid, initially filled with white (0).
3. Generates a base pattern on the 16x16 grid: A 5x5 arrangement of 2x2 blocks using the input background color, separated by single white lines. Specifically, cells (r, c) where neither (r mod 3) nor (c mod 3) is 0 are set to the background color.
4. Checks if the input grid contains any pixel with a color different from the background color.
5. If non-background pixels exist in the input, overlays a fixed pattern of maroon (9) onto the base output grid.
6. Returns the final 16x16 grid.
