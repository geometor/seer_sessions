            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core components: white (W), red (R), and blue (B) objects/pixels, and the basic transformations (W->B, and either R->W or B->W). However, the conditional logic determining *which* object (R or a specific B) turns white was incorrect, leading to failures in all examples.\n\nThe failures stemmed from misunderstandings in the priority of shape matching and the specific conditions for the R->W swap versus the B->W swap.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-evaluate Conditions:** Precisely define the conditions based on shape equality (W vs. R) and the existence of blue subregions matching W's shape.\n2.  **Prioritize Blue Match:** Establish that checking for a blue subregion matching W's shape is always the primary condition after the mandatory W->B change.\n3.  **Refine Rules:** Update the `IF/ELSE` structure in the natural language program and YAML facts to reflect the correct priority and outcomes for both `shapeW == shapeR` and `shapeW != shapeR` cases.\n4.  **Verify Subregion Finding:** Ensure the concept and implementation of `find_subregion_with_shape` correctly identify contiguous blue pixels matching the target shape *within the original input grid*.\n5.  **Use Metrics:** Use code execution to verify shapes and the presence/absence of matching blue subregions in each example to confirm the refined rules.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"

            "text": "**Revised Analysis based on Metrics**\n\nThe metrics calculation seems to have an error in Example 3. Let's re-examine manually:\n*   Example 3 Input:\n    *   W object: Color 0 at (12,1), (12,2), (12,3), (13,1), (13,2), (13,3), (14,1), (14,2), (14,3). This is a 3x3 square. Shape Size = 9. `shapeW = frozenset({(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)})`\n    *   R object: Color 2 at (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). This is also a 3x3 square. Shape Size = 9. `shapeR = frozenset({(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)})`\n    *   Shapes Match: True.\n    *   Blue Pixels (Color 1): Many. Is there a 3x3 blue subregion? Yes, e.g., at (6,7) anchor: (6,7),(6,8),(6,9), (7,7),(7,8),(7,9), (8,7),(8,8),(8,9). Blue_Matches_W = True.\n*   The code output incorrectly stated W_Shape_Size=3, R_Shape_Size=3x3=9, Shapes_Match=False for Example 3. This indicates a potential bug in the metric gathering code itself (likely `find_objects` or `get_object_shape` for the white object in Ex3). Let's assume the manual analysis is correct.\n\n**Corrected Logic based on Manual Analysis & Expected Outputs:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** W(2x2), R(2x2). Shapes match. Blue 2x2 *exists* at (2,1). Expected output: R->White. W->Blue. *Implication:* The existence of a blue shape matching W does *not* always mean the blue shape changes. It only changes *if* it exists? No, that doesn't fit. Let's re-read the *entire* problem description and expected outputs.\n    *   Ex1 In: W(2x2) at (9,8), R(2x2) at (0,1). Blue 2x2 at (2,1).\n    *   Ex1 Out: R at (0,1) -> White. W at (9,8) -> Blue. Blue at (2,1) -> Unchanged.\n    *   Rule inferred: If W==R AND **NO** blue object matches W's shape, THEN R->White.\n    *   My metrics said Blue_Matches_W was True for Ex1. Why? Ah, `find_subregion_with_shape` looks *anywhere*. The blue object at (2,1) *is* a 2x2. Okay.\n    *   So, Ex1: W==R. Blue matching W *exists*. Expected output: R->White. This contradicts the previous attempt's logic.\n*   **Example 2:** W(2x2), R(2x2). Shapes match. Blue 2x2 *exists* at (2,5) and (7,9). Expected output: Blue at (7,9) -> White. W->Blue. R unchanged.\n    *   Rule inferred: If W==R AND Blue matching W *exists*, THEN Blue(matching W)->White.\n*   **Example 3:** W(3x3), R(3x3). Shapes match. Blue 3x3 *exists* at (6,7). Expected output: Blue at (6,7) -> White. W->Blue. R unchanged.\n    *   Rule inferred: If W==R AND Blue matching W *exists*, THEN Blue(matching W)->White. (Consistent with Ex2).\n*   **Example 4:** W(1x1), R(1x1). Shapes match. Blue 1x1 *exists* (many). Expected output: R->White. W->Blue.\n    *   Rule inferred: If W==R AND **NO** blue object matches W's shape, THEN R->White. Wait, blue 1x1s *do* exist. This is confusing.\n\nLet's reconsider \"object\" vs \"subregion\". Maybe we should use `find_objects` for blue as well?\n\n*   Ex1: W(2x2), R(2x2). Blue Objects: 2x2 at (2,1), L-shape at (3,4), complex shape... Does any *complete* blue object match shapeW? Yes, the one at (2,1). Expected Output: R->White.\n*   Ex2: W(2x2), R(2x2). Blue Objects: 2x2 at (2,5), 2x2 at (7,9), large complex shape... Do any *complete* blue objects match shapeW? Yes, two of them. Expected Output: Blue at (7,9) -> White. Why that one? Position? Closest? Last?\n*   Ex3: W(3x3), R(3x3). Blue Objects: 3x3 at (6,7), others... Does any *complete* blue object match shapeW? Yes, at (6,7). Expected Output: Blue at (6,7) -> White.\n*   Ex4: W(1x1), R(1x1). Blue Objects: 1x2 at (1,2), 1x1 at (2,3), 1x3 at (2,5), ... Does any *complete* blue object match shapeW (1x1)? Yes, at (2,3), (3,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,4), (7,4), (7,8), (8,4), (8,8). Expected Output: R->White.\n\nOkay, using *complete objects* found by `find_objects` seems key.\n\n**Revised Logic Attempt 2:**\n\n1.  Find the single white object W (coords `W_coords`, shape `shapeW`).\n2.  Find the single red object R (coords `R_coords`, shape `shapeR`).\n3.  Find *all* complete, contiguous blue objects `{B}` (list of coord sets). Calculate their shapes `{shapeBi}`.\n4.  **Mandatory Change:** W -> Blue.\n5.  Find the subset of blue objects `B_match_W` where `shapeBi == shapeW`.\n6.  **IF `shapeW == shapeR`:**\n    *   IF `B_match_W` is *empty* (no blue object has the same shape as W/R):\n        *   Change R -> White.\n    *   ELSE (`B_match_W` is not empty):\n        *   Select *one* target blue object `Bk` from `B_match_W`. (Rule needed: First found? Lowest row/col anchor? Largest coord sum? Let's re-check Ex2 - (7,9) was chosen over (2,5). (7,9) has a higher row index). Let's tentatively choose the one whose top-left anchor (min row, then min col) is largest (bottom-most, then right-most).\n        *   Change `Bk` -> White.\n7.  **ELSE (`shapeW != shapeR`):**\n    *   IF `B_match_W` is *not* empty:\n        *   Select one target blue object `Bk` from `B_match_W` (using the same selection rule as 6.ELSE).\n        *   Change `Bk` -> White.\n    *   ELSE (`B_match_W` is empty):\n        *   Find the subset of blue objects `B_match_R` where `shapeBi == shapeR`.\n        *   IF `B_match_R` is *not* empty:\n            *   Select one target blue object `Bk` from `B_match_R` (using the same selection rule).\n            *   Change `Bk` -> White.\n        *   ELSE (No blue object matches W or R):\n            *   No further changes (only W changed to Blue).\n\nLet's test this logic:\n*   Ex1: W(2x2), R(2x2). Shapes match. Blue objects: 2x2@ (2,1), others. `B_match_W` contains {coords of blue@(2,1)}. Condition 6.ELSE applies. Select the only matching blue object. Change blue@(2,1) -> White. **This STILL doesn't match the expected output (R->White).**\n\n**Third Reassessment:** There must be a simpler distinguishing feature. What's different between Ex1/Ex4 (where R->W) and Ex2/Ex3 (where B->W)?\n\n*   Ex1: W(2x2), R(2x2). Match. Blue 2x2 exists. Output: R->W.\n*   Ex2: W(2x2), R(2x2). Match. Blue 2x2 exists. Output: B->W.\n*   Ex3: W(3x3), R(3x3). Match. Blue 3x3 exists. Output: B->W.\n*   Ex4: W(1x1), R(1x1). Match. Blue 1x1 exists. Output: R->W.\n\nIs it about *overlap* or *adjacency*?\n*   Ex1: W at (9,8), R at (0,1). Blue 2x2 at (2,1). No overlaps. R is adjacent (diag) to blue 2x2. W is far away.\n*   Ex2: W at (2,10), R at (12,1). Blue 2x2 at (2,5) & (7,9). W is adjacent to the blue block containing (2,5). The chosen B(7,9) is not adjacent to W or R.\n*   Ex3: W at (12,1), R at (0,0). Blue 3x3 at (6,7). None are adjacent.\n*   Ex4: W at (1,1), R at (9,4). Blue 1x1s exist. W adjacent to blue 1x2 at (1,2). R not adjacent to any blue.\n\nThis isn't clarifying. Let's reconsider the simplest case: **WHEN does R turn white?** Only in Ex1 and Ex4. In both, `shapeW == shapeR`. What else is common?\n*   Ex1: W=2x2, R=2x2. Blue 2x2 exists.\n*   Ex4: W=1x1, R=1x1. Blue 1x1 exists.\n\n**WHEN does Blue turn white?** Only in Ex2 and Ex3. In both, `shapeW == shapeR`.\n*   Ex2: W=2x2, R=2x2. Blue 2x2 exists.\n*   Ex3: W=3x3, R=3x3. Blue 3x3 exists.\n\nThis seems contradictory. The *only* difference is the specific grids.\n\nCould the `find_subregion_with_shape` being correct in the metrics be the key?\nIf we use the subregion logic (allowing matches within larger blue areas):\n*   Ex1: W(2x2), R(2x2). Shapes match. Blue *subregion* matching W exists (at 2,1). Expected: R->W.\n*   Ex2: W(2x2), R(2x2). Shapes match. Blue *subregion* matching W exists (at 2,5 and 7,9). Expected: B(7,9)->W.\n*   Ex3: W(3x3), R(3x3). Shapes match. Blue *subregion* matching W exists (at 6,7). Expected: B(6,7)->W.\n*   Ex4: W(1x1), R(1x1). Shapes match. Blue *subregion* matching W exists (many). Expected: R->W.\n\nOkay, let's refine the rule based on *subregions* found by `find_subregion_with_shape`:\n\n**Revised Logic Attempt 3 (Using Subregions):**\n\n1.  Find W (coords `W_coords`, shape `shapeW`).\n2.  Find R (coords `R_coords`, shape `shapeR`).\n3.  **Mandatory Change:** W -> Blue.\n4.  Find *first* blue subregion matching `shapeW` (coords `B_match_W_coords`).\n5.  **IF `shapeW == shapeR`:**\n    *   IF `B_match_W_coords` is `None`:\n        *   Change R -> White.\n    *   ELSE (`B_match_W_coords` exists):\n        *   **This is the tricky part.** Why does R->W in Ex1/Ex4 but B->W in Ex2/Ex3?\n        *   Compare location? In Ex1, R is at (0,1), W is at (9,8). Matching Blue is at (2,1). In Ex4, R is at (9,4), W is at (1,1). Matching Blue is at (1,2).\n        *   In Ex2, R is at (12,1), W is at (2,10). Matching Blue is at (2,5) [first], expected change is at (7,9). In Ex3, R is at (0,0), W is at (12,1). Matching Blue is at (1,10) [first], expected change is at (6,7).\n        *   What if the rule is: If `shapeW == shapeR` AND a blue subregion `B` matching `shapeW` exists, THEN IF `W_coords == B_coords` (i.e., the white object *was* blue - impossible by definition) OR `R_coords == B_coords` (i.e., the red object *was* blue - impossible by definition), THEN R->White ELSE B->White? No, colors are distinct.\n        *   What if it depends on *which* matching blue region is chosen? The `find_subregion` finds the first (lowest row, then lowest col).\n            *   Ex1: Finds blue@(2,1). Expected: R->W.\n            *   Ex2: Finds blue@(2,5). Expected: B@(7,9)->W.\n            *   Ex3: Finds blue@(1,10). Expected: B@(6,7)->W. (Assuming my manual check for first blue 3x3 was wrong and code was right).\n            *   Ex4: Finds blue@(1,2). Expected: R->W.\n        *   Hypothesis: If `shapeW == shapeR` and a matching blue subregion `B` exists: IF this first-found `B` overlaps/is identical to the original R object's location OR the original W object's location (impossible by color constraints, but maybe relevant if colors could overlap?), THEN change R->W. ELSE change *that specific first-found B* -> W.\n            *   Ex1: B@(2,1) does not overlap W@(9,8) or R@(0,1). Hypothesis predicts B->W. **Incorrect.**\n            *   Ex4: B@(1,2) does not overlap W@(1,1) or R@(9,4). Hypothesis predicts B->W. **Incorrect.**\n\n**Let's discard the subregion idea and go back to OBJECTS.** My analysis of Ex1/Ex4 matching the expected output was wrong earlier.\n\n**Re-Re-Analysis with OBJECTS:**\n\n*   Ex1: W(2x2), R(2x2). Shapes Match. Blue OBJECT matching W exists? Yes, at (2,1). Expected: R->W.\n*   Ex2: W(2x2), R(2x2). Shapes Match. Blue OBJECT matching W exists? Yes, at (2,5) and (7,9). Expected: B@(7,9)->W.\n*   Ex3: W(3x3), R(3x3). Shapes Match. Blue OBJECT matching W exists? Yes, at (6,7). Expected: B@(6,7)->W.\n*   Ex4: W(1x1), R(1x1). Shapes Match. Blue OBJECT matching W exists? Yes, multiple. Expected: R->W.\n\nThere *must* be a condition distinguishing {Ex1, Ex4} from {Ex2, Ex3} when shapes match and a matching blue object exists.\n\n*   Could it be the *number* of matching blue objects?\n    *   Ex1: One matching blue obj. Output: R->W.\n    *   Ex2: Two matching blue objs. Output: B->W (the last one?).\n    *   Ex3: One matching blue obj. Output: B->W.\n    *   Ex4: Multiple matching blue objs. Output: R->W.\n    *   This doesn't hold (Ex1 vs Ex3).\n\n*   Is the red object (R) *also* blue somewhere else? No, R is always red.\n*   Is the white object (W) *also* blue somewhere else? No.\n\nLet's revisit the exact outputs vs inputs carefully.\n\n**Example 1:**\nInput W: (9,8),(9,9),(10,8),(10,9) - Color 0\nInput R: (0,1),(0,2),(1,1),(1,2) - Color 2\nInput B obj match W: (2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(3,2) - Color 1\nOutput: R coords become 0. W coords become 1. B obj coords remain 1.\nRule: W==R, B_match exists -> R->W.\n\n**Example 2:**\nInput W: (2,10),(2,11),(3,10),(3,11) - Color 0\nInput R: (12,1),(12,2),(13,1),(13,2) - Color 2\nInput B obj match W #1: (2,5),(2,6),(3,5),(3,6) - Color 1\nInput B obj match W #2: (7,9),(7,10),(8,9),(8,10) - Color 1\nOutput: W coords become 1. R coords remain 2. B obj #1 coords remain 1. B obj #2 coords become 0.\nRule: W==R, B_match exists -> B(last one?)->W.\n\n**Example 3:**\nInput W: 3x3@(12,1) - Color 0\nInput R: 3x3@(0,0) - Color 2\nInput B obj match W: 3x3@(6,7) - Color 1\nOutput: W coords become 1. R coords remain 2. B obj coords become 0.\nRule: W==R, B_match exists -> B->W.\n\n**Example 4:**\nInput W: (1,1) - Color 0\nInput R: (9,4) - Color 2\nInput B obj match W: Many single pixels. Let's list anchors: (2,3), (3,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,4), (7,4), (7,8), (8,4), (8,8).\nOutput: R coords become 0. W coords become 1. B obj coords remain 1.\nRule: W==R, B_match exists -> R->W.\n\n**FINAL HYPOTHESIS:**\nThe rule depends on whether the **Red object R** also exists as a **Blue object** somewhere else in the grid.\n\n1.  Find W (coords, shapeW). Find R (coords, shapeR). Find all Blue objects {Bi} (coords, shapeBi).\n2.  Mandatory: W -> Blue.\n3.  Check if any Blue object `Bj` exists such that `shapeBj == shapeR`. Let this set be `B_match_R`.\n4.  Check if any Blue object `Bk` exists such that `shapeBk == shapeW`. Let this set be `B_match_W`.\n5.  **IF `shapeW == shapeR`:**\n    *   IF `B_match_R` is **empty** (no blue object has the same shape as R/W):\n        *   Change R -> White. (This covers Ex1 & Ex4 - check data below)\n    *   ELSE (`B_match_R` is not empty):\n        *   Select the target Blue object `Bt` from `B_match_R` (e.g., last one found / highest anchor row/col).\n        *   Change `Bt` -> White. (This covers Ex2 & Ex3 - check data below)\n6.  **ELSE (`shapeW != shapeR`):**\n    *   IF `B_match_W` is **not empty**:\n        *   Select target `Bt` from `B_match_W`. Change `Bt` -> White.\n    *   ELSE (`B_match_W` is empty):\n        *   IF `B_match_R` is **not empty**:\n            *   Select target `Bt` from `B_match_R`. Change `Bt` -> White.\n        *   ELSE: No further changes.\n\nLet's re-check the data for this hypothesis:\n*   Ex1: W(2x2), R(2x2). Does a blue object match R's shape (2x2)? Yes, at (2,1). Hypothesis predicts B->W. **Still fails.**\n*   Ex2: W(2x2), R(2x2). Does a blue object match R's shape (2x2)? Yes, at (2,5) and (7,9). Hypothesis predicts B->W (e.g., the one at 7,9). **Matches expected.**\n*   Ex3: W(3x3), R(3x3). Does a blue object match R's shape (3x3)? Yes, at (6,7). Hypothesis predicts B->W. **Matches expected.**\n*   Ex4: W(1x1), R(1x1). Does a blue object match R's shape (1x1)? Yes, many. Hypothesis predicts B->W. **Still fails.**\n\nI am fundamentally misunderstanding the condition that differentiates Ex1/Ex4 from Ex2/Ex3. It cannot be shape equality or existence of matching blue shapes alone.\n\nWhat if the white object location relative to the grid matters? Or red?\n\nLet's look at the pixels *changed* in the output compared to the input:\n*   Ex1: Pixels at W coords (0->1). Pixels at R coords (2->0).\n*   Ex2: Pixels at W coords (0->1). Pixels at B obj @(7,9) coords (1->0).\n*   Ex3: Pixels at W coords (0->1). Pixels at B obj @(6,7) coords (1->0).\n*   Ex4: Pixels at W coords (0->1). Pixels at R coords (2->0).\n\nRule: W always becomes B. One other object becomes W.\nCandidate objects to become W: R, or any B object.\nSelection criteria:\nIF `shapeW == shapeR`:\n  IF ??? : Select R to become W. (Condition true in Ex1, Ex4)\n  ELSE : Select a B object (matching shape W? matching shape R?) to become W. (Condition true in Ex2, Ex3)\nELSE (`shapeW != shapeR`): (No examples provided for this case!)\n  Select a B object (matching shape W first, then shape R?) to become W.\n\nWhat is the ??? condition?\nIs R adjacent to W? Ex1: No. Ex4: No. Ex2: No. Ex3: No.\nIs R identical to a B object in shape? Ex1: Yes. Ex4: Yes. Ex2: Yes. Ex3: Yes. This doesn't differentiate.\nIs W identical to a B object in shape? Ex1: Yes. Ex4: Yes. Ex2: Yes. Ex3: Yes. This doesn't differentiate.\n\nMaybe the crucial part is the selection *amongst* the matching blue objects.\nIf W==R, find all blue objects `Bk` where `shapeBk == shapeW`.\n  If this set is empty -> Change R to W. (Never happens in examples).\n  If this set is non-empty -> ??? determines if R->W or B->W.\n    If R->W (Ex1, Ex4): What's special? In Ex1, only one B matches W. In Ex4, multiple B match W.\n    If B->W (Ex2, Ex3): What's special? In Ex2, multiple B match W. In Ex3, only one B matches W.\n\nThis is highly ambiguous. Let's assume the simplest rule that fits Ex2/Ex3: If W==R and a B matching W exists, change B->W. This contradicts Ex1/Ex4.\nLet's assume the simplest rule that fits Ex1/Ex4: If W==R and a B matching W exists, change R->W. This contradicts Ex2/Ex3.\n\nPossibility: The interpretation of \"shape\" is wrong. But they look identical.\nPossibility: Connectivity matters differently? (Used 8-way).\nPossibility: There's a hidden priority (e.g. color transformation order matters).\n\nLet's try the simplest path covering most cases:\nRule: W->B. If shapeW == shapeR AND a Blue object B exists with shapeB == shapeW, THEN change B->W (choose last/bottom-right if multiple). ELSE change R->W.\n*   Ex1: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> B->W. Expected R->W. **Fail.**\n*   Ex2: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> B->W (select 7,9). Expected B->W. **Pass.**\n*   Ex3: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> B->W. Expected B->W. **Pass.**\n*   Ex4: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> B->W. Expected R->W. **Fail.**\n\nLet's try the opposite simple path:\nRule: W->B. If shapeW == shapeR AND a Blue object B exists with shapeB == shapeW, THEN change R->W. ELSE (no matching B exists OR shapeW != shapeR)... need logic for this part. Assume if W!=R, then B->W if match found.\n*   Ex1: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> R->W. Expected R->W. **Pass.**\n*   Ex2: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> R->W. Expected B->W. **Fail.**\n*   Ex3: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> R->W. Expected B->W. **Fail.**\n*   Ex4: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> R->W. Expected R->W. **Pass.**\n\nNeither simple rule works. The differentiating factor is elusive. Reverting to the object-based logic and acknowledging the ambiguity in selection when W==R and B_match_W exists. The safest bet might be the logic from the *second* code attempt, which passed Ex2/Ex3 but failed Ex1/Ex4. Maybe the selection rule for B needs refinement, or there's an edge case for 1x1 or specific positioning causing Ex1/Ex4 to revert to R->W.\n\nGiven the conflict, I will document the logic that worked for Ex2/Ex3, explicitly noting the conflict with Ex1/Ex4.\n\n**YAML Facts (Reflecting Logic Attempt Matching Ex2/Ex3)**\n\n"
