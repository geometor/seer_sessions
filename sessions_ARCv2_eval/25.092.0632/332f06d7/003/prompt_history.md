**Perception**

1.  **Colors:** The grids primarily use green (3) as a background/border color. Key active colors are red (2), white (0), and blue (1).
2.  **Objects:** In each input grid, there appear to be distinct, contiguous objects composed of red pixels and white pixels. There are also objects or regions composed of blue pixels. Often, there seems to be exactly one red object and one white object.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the white object(s) and one other object (either the red object or a blue object).
    *   **White to Blue:** All white pixels in the input consistently become blue pixels in the output.
    *   **Something to White:** Exactly one other object changes its color to white.
4.  **Conditional Change:** The object that changes *to* white depends on a condition related to the shapes of the white and red objects, and the presence of blue objects with specific shapes.
    *   If the white object and the red object have the exact same shape, *and* no blue object shares this shape, then the red object becomes white.
    *   Otherwise (if white and red shapes differ, OR if a blue object shares the white object's shape), the red object remains unchanged, and a specific blue object becomes white.
5.  **Blue Object Selection (if applicable):** When a blue object is chosen to become white, the selection criteria seem to be:
    *   If a blue object exists with the same shape as the original white object, that blue object is chosen.
    *   If not, but a blue object exists with the same shape as the red object, that blue object is chosen.

**Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - color: white (0)
    property: forms a single contiguous object (assumption based on examples)
    shape: variable (e.g., 1x1, 2x2, 3x1)
    action: always changes color to blue (1)
  - color: red (2)
    property: forms a single contiguous object (assumption based on examples)
    shape: variable (e.g., 1x1, 2x2, 3x3)
    action:
      - changes color to white (0) IF its shape matches the white object's shape AND no blue object shares that shape.
      - remains unchanged otherwise.
  - color: blue (1)
    property: forms one or more contiguous objects/regions
    shape: variable
    action:
      - one specific blue object changes color to white (0) IF the red object does not change to white.
      - remains unchanged otherwise (except where white pixels become blue).
  - color: green (3)
    property: appears as background or border
    action: remains unchanged

relationships:
  - type: shape_comparison
    between: [white object, red object]
    purpose: determines if red object changes to white (Rule A trigger)
  - type: shape_comparison
    between: [white object, blue objects]
    purpose: determines if Rule A is overridden; identifies candidate blue object for Rule B
  - type: shape_comparison
    between: [red object, blue objects]
    purpose: identifies candidate blue object for Rule B (if no blue object matches white shape)

transformation_rules:
  - rule: A (Primary Swap)
    condition: shape(white_object) == shape(red_object) AND NOT EXISTS blue_object WHERE shape(blue_object) == shape(white_object)
    steps:
      - change white_object pixels to blue (1)
      - change red_object pixels to white (0)
  - rule: B (White->Blue, Blue->White)
    condition: shape(white_object) != shape(red_object) OR EXISTS blue_object WHERE shape(blue_object) == shape(white_object)
    steps:
      - change white_object pixels to blue (1)
      - leave red_object unchanged
      - find target_blue_object:
          - IF EXISTS blue_object WHERE shape(blue_object) == shape(white_object):
              target_blue_object = that blue_object
          - ELSE IF EXISTS blue_object WHERE shape(blue_object) == shape(red_object):
              target_blue_object = that blue_object
          - ELSE:
              # (Case not observed in examples, default might be no change or error)
              target_blue_object = None
      - IF target_blue_object exists:
          change target_blue_object pixels to white (0)

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the single contiguous object composed of white (0) pixels. Determine its shape and location. Let this be `W`.
2.  Identify the single contiguous object composed of red (2) pixels. Determine its shape and location. Let this be `R`.
3.  Identify all contiguous objects composed of blue (1) pixels. Determine their shapes and locations. Let this set be `{B}`.
4.  Compare the shape of `W` with the shape of `R`.
5.  Check if any blue object `Bi` in `{B}` has the same shape as `W`.
6.  **Decision Point:**
    *   **IF** the shape of `W` is identical to the shape of `R`, **AND** no blue object `Bi` has the same shape as `W`:
        *   Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
        *   Change all pixels corresponding to `W` in the output grid to blue (1).
        *   Change all pixels corresponding to `R` in the output grid to white (0).
    *   **ELSE** (the shapes of `W` and `R` differ, OR a blue object `Bi` has the same shape as `W`):
        *   Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
        *   Change all pixels corresponding to `W` in the output grid to blue (1).
        *   Leave the pixels corresponding to `R` unchanged (still red).
        *   Find a target blue object `Bk` to change to white:
            *   Search for a blue object `Bi` in `{B}` whose shape is identical to the shape of `W`. If found, this is `Bk`.
            *   If no such blue object is found, search for a blue object `Bj` in `{B}` whose shape is identical to the shape of `R`. If found, this is `Bk`.
        *   If a target blue object `Bk` was found, change all pixels corresponding to `Bk` in the output grid to white (0).
7.  Return the modified output grid.

Okay, the initial code failed on two examples (2 and 3). The failure mode was consistent: the code changed the red object to white when it should have remained red, and it failed to change a blue region to white. This occurred specifically when the white object and red object had the same shape, and a blue region *also* existed with that same shape.

The root cause, revealed by the `tool_code` analysis, was an incorrect understanding of "blue objects". The `find_objects` function, even with 8-directional connectivity, often found a single large, connected blue region rather than multiple distinct objects. The critical insight is that the transformation rule doesn't necessarily look for a *separate* blue object matching the shape, but rather for a *sub-region* within the blue pixels that matches the required shape.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

1.  **Initial Hypothesis Error:** The assumption that the relevant blue element would be a disconnected, separate object was incorrect. ARC objects are defined by connectivity, and diagonal connections often merge visually distinct areas into one object.
2.  **Revised Hypothesis:** The transformation logic involves identifying potential sub-regions within the pixels of a specific color (primarily blue) that match the shape of either the white or red object.
3.  **Connectivity:** Using 8-directional connectivity for finding the full extent of colored regions seems appropriate for ARC tasks.
4.  **Sub-region Identification:** The core task is now to implement a reliable way to check if a given shape exists as a contiguous sub-part of a larger colored area.
5.  **Refined Logic:** The decision logic (when to change red vs. when to change blue) depends on the shapes of white and red *and* the existence of a blue sub-region matching the white shape. If shapes match AND no matching blue sub-region exists, red changes. Otherwise, a blue sub-region (matching white shape first, then red shape if necessary) changes.

**Metrics and Verification**

The `tool_code` executions confirmed:
*   Examples 1 & 4 worked with the initial logic because either the shapes didn't match (Ex 4) or they matched but no blue region/sub-region had that shape (Ex 1).
*   Examples 2 & 3 failed because shapes matched (2x2 in Ex2, 3x3 in Ex3) AND a blue sub-region with that same shape existed within the larger blue area. The original code failed to detect this sub-region, incorrectly triggering the "change red to white" rule.
*   The `find_objects` function (both 4-dir and 8-dir) correctly identified the full extent of connected regions based on the connectivity rule used, but this didn't align with the required "sub-region" matching logic.

**Facts (Revised)**


```yaml
objects:
  - color: white (0)
    property: forms a single contiguous object (W)
    shape: variable, denoted shape(W)
    action: always changes color to blue (1) in the output.
  - color: red (2)
    property: forms a single contiguous object (R)
    shape: variable, denoted shape(R)
    action:
      - changes color to white (0) IF shape(W) == shape(R) AND no sub-region within blue pixels matches shape(W).
      - remains unchanged (red) otherwise.
  - color: blue (1)
    property: forms one or more contiguous regions/pixels (B)
    shape: region is variable; contains potential sub-regions.
    action:
      - A specific sub-region changes color to white (0) IF the red object does not change to white.
      - The sub-region chosen is the first one found that matches shape(W).
      - If no sub-region matches shape(W), the sub-region chosen is the first one found that matches shape(R) (only applicable if shape(W) != shape(R)).
      - Pixels originally white become blue, adding to the blue pixels.
      - Other blue pixels remain unchanged.
  - color: green (3)
    property: background/border
    action: remains unchanged

    between: [white object (W), red object (R)]
    purpose: Primary condition for determining R's fate.
  - type: shape_embedding_check
    target_shape: shape(W)
    search_area_color: blue (1)
    purpose: Secondary condition for R's fate; identifies primary candidate blue sub-region to change.
  - type: shape_embedding_check
    target_shape: shape(R)
    search_area_color: blue (1)
    purpose: Identifies secondary candidate blue sub-region to change (used only if shape(W) != shape(R) and no blue sub-region matches shape(W)).

transformation_rules:
  - rule: Base Change
    steps:
      - Identify W, R, and all blue pixels B.
      - Determine shape(W) and shape(R).
      - Create output grid copy.
      - Change all pixels of W to blue (1) in the output grid.
  - rule: Conditional Change (apply one)
    - condition_A: shape(W) == shape(R)
      - sub_condition_A1: A sub-region matching shape(W) exists within the original blue pixels B.
        - steps:
            - Find one such blue sub-region.
            - Change the pixels of that sub-region to white (0) in the output grid.
            - Leave R unchanged (red).
      - sub_condition_A2: No sub-region matching shape(W) exists within the original blue pixels B.
        - steps:
            - Change all pixels of R to white (0) in the output grid.
    - condition_B: shape(W) != shape(R)
      - steps:
          - Leave R unchanged (red).
          - Find if a sub-region matching shape(W) exists within the original blue pixels B.
          - IF YES:
              - Change the pixels of the first found matching sub-region to white (0).
          - IF NO:
              - Find if a sub-region matching shape(R) exists within the original blue pixels B.
              - IF YES:
                 - Change the pixels of the first found matching sub-region to white (0).
              # (Implicit ELSE: if neither shape W nor R matches a blue sub-region, no blue pixels change to white).

**Natural Language Program (Revised)**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the contiguous set of white (0) pixels. Record their coordinates (`W_coords`) and determine their relative shape (`shapeW`).
3.  Identify the contiguous set of red (2) pixels. Record their coordinates (`R_coords`) and determine their relative shape (`shapeR`).
4.  Identify all blue (1) pixels in the input grid. Record their coordinates (`B_coords`).
5.  **Mandatory Change:** Change the color of all pixels at `W_coords` to blue (1) in the output grid.
6.  **Conditional Changes:**
    *   **Compare shapes:** Check if `shapeW` is identical to `shapeR`.
    *   **Search for Blue Sub-region matching White:** Check if there exists a sub-set of coordinates within `B_coords` that, when treated as an object, has the shape `shapeW`. Let the first such found sub-set be `TargetB_W`.
    *   **IF** `shapeW` == `shapeR`:
        *   **IF** `TargetB_W` exists (a blue sub-region matching `shapeW` was found):
            *   Change the color of all pixels at coordinates `TargetB_W` to white (0) in the output grid.
            *   Leave the red object at `R_coords` unchanged (red).
        *   **ELSE** (`TargetB_W` does not exist):
            *   Change the color of all pixels at `R_coords` to white (0) in the output grid.
    *   **ELSE** (`shapeW` != `shapeR`):
        *   Leave the red object at `R_coords` unchanged (red).
        *   **IF** `TargetB_W` exists:
            *   Change the color of all pixels at coordinates `TargetB_W` to white (0) in the output grid.
        *   **ELSE** (`TargetB_W` does not exist):
            *   **Search for Blue Sub-region matching Red:** Check if there exists a sub-set of coordinates within `B_coords` that, when treated as an object, has the shape `shapeR`. Let the first such found sub-set be `TargetB_R`.
            *   **IF** `TargetB_R` exists:
                *   Change the color of all pixels at coordinates `TargetB_R` to white (0) in the output grid.
            *   **(ELSE)** (Neither `TargetB_W` nor `TargetB_R` exists): No further changes are made.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
