task_description: Fill enclosed white regions with a special color found elsewhere in the grid.
elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9.
  - element: background
    color: 0 (white)
    role: Fills most of the grid, some areas are targeted for filling.
  - element: boundary_pixels
    color: Any non-white color (1-9)
    role: Form shapes and enclose regions of white pixels. Specific color doesn't matter for enclosure, only that it's non-white.
  - element: enclosed_regions
    description: Contiguous areas of white pixels (0) fully surrounded by non-white pixels. These regions do not touch the grid borders.
    property: target_for_filling
  - element: special_pixel
    description: A single pixel in the input grid with a specific color.
    color: 4 (yellow) or 7 (orange)
    role: Determines the color used to fill the enclosed regions. There is exactly one such pixel per input grid.
    property: fill_color
relationships:
  - type: enclosure
    subject: boundary_pixels
    object: enclosed_regions
    description: Non-white pixels form a boundary completely surrounding a region of white pixels (using 4-connectivity).
  - type: color_source
    subject: special_pixel
    object: enclosed_regions
    description: The color of the special_pixel is used as the new color for the pixels within the enclosed_regions in the output.
actions:
  - action: find_special_pixel
    input: input_grid
    output: fill_color (color 4 or 7)
    description: Locate the unique pixel with color 4 or 7.
  - action: identify_enclosed_regions
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_enclosed_regions (coordinates of white pixels in each region)
    description: Find all contiguous regions of white pixels that are fully surrounded by non-white pixels and do not touch the grid border.
  - action: fill_regions
    input: input_grid, fill_color, list_of_enclosed_regions
    output: output_grid
    description: Create the output grid by copying the input grid and changing the color of all pixels within the identified enclosed regions to the fill_color.
