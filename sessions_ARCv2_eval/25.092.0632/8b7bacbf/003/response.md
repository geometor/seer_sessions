"""
Identifies contiguous regions of white pixels (color 0) that are fully enclosed 
within a boundary composed of a single non-white color and do not touch the grid border. 
These enclosed regions are then filled with a special color (either 4 or 7) 
which is determined by finding the unique pixel of that color elsewhere in the input grid.

Transformation Steps:
1. Find the unique special 'fill_color' (4 or 7) in the input grid.
2. Create a copy of the input grid for the output.
3. Identify all white pixels (0) that are not connected to the grid border via a path of white pixels.
4. Group these border-disconnected white pixels into contiguous regions (components).
5. For each such region:
    a. Find all non-white pixels immediately adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the region.
    b. Check if all these adjacent non-white pixels have the exact same color.
    c. If the boundary color is uniform, fill all pixels within this white region in the output grid with the 'fill_color'.
6. Return the modified output grid.
