**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves identifying specific regions within the input grid and modifying their color based on a global property of the grid.

1.  **Input Grid Analysis:** The input grids contain various shapes and patterns formed by different colored pixels against a white background (color 0). Key colors observed are blue (2), green (3), yellow (4), gray (5), and orange (7). Other colors like blue (1) are also present but seem less critical to the core transformation.
2.  **Output Grid Analysis:** The output grids are largely identical to the input grids, except that certain areas of white pixels (0) have been filled with a specific color.
3.  **Identifying the Transformation Trigger:** In each example, there is exactly one pixel with a "special" color: orange (7) in `train_1` and yellow (4) in `train_2`, `train_3`, and `train_4`. This special color becomes the "fill color" in the output.
4.  **Identifying the Target Regions:** The regions that get filled are areas composed entirely of white pixels (0). These white regions appear to be completely enclosed or surrounded by non-white pixels. The shape and color of the enclosing pixels do not determine the fill color, only that they are non-white.
5.  **Defining "Enclosed":** A white region seems to be considered "enclosed" if it does not touch the boundary of the grid and all paths leading out of the region must cross a non-white pixel. This suggests using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right neighbours) to define regions and their boundaries.
6.  **Transformation Rule:** The core transformation is to find the unique special color pixel (orange 7 or yellow 4) in the input, identify all fully enclosed white regions, and change the color of all pixels within these enclosed regions to the special color.

**YAML Facts:**

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input grid to find the single pixel whose color is either yellow (4) or orange (7). Store this color as the `fill_color`.
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
3.  Identify all contiguous regions of white (0) pixels in the input grid.
4.  For each identified white region:
    a.  Check if the region is fully enclosed. A region is fully enclosed if none of its pixels are located on the border rows or columns of the grid, AND all pixels immediately adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the pixels of the white region are non-white pixels. (Alternatively, perform a flood fill starting from all white pixels on the grid border; any white pixel *not* reached by this fill belongs to an enclosed region).
    b.  If a white region is determined to be fully enclosed, change the color of all pixels belonging to that region in the copied grid to the `fill_color` identified in step 1.
5.  The modified copied grid is the final output grid.
