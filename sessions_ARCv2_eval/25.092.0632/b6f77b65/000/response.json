This pixel's color varies across examples (maroon, yellow, magenta, orange).\n    *   Besides the top-left pixel, the input grids contain various colored shapes or patterns composed of non-white pixels.\n    *   In the output grid, the top-left pixel remains unchanged from the input.\n    *   All other non-white pixels and the patterns they form appear to be shifted vertically downwards relative to their position in the input grid.\n    *   The amount of the downward shift seems correlated with the color of the top-left pixel.\n    *   By comparing input and output pairs:\n        *   `train_1`: Top-left is maroon (9). No shift occurs (shift = 0).\n        *   `train_2`: Top-left is yellow (4). Shapes shift down by 3 rows.\n        *   `train_3`: Top-left is magenta (6). Shapes shift down by 2 rows.\n        *   `train_4`: Top-left is yellow (4). Shapes shift down by 3 rows.\n        *   `train_5`: Top-left is orange (7). Shapes shift down by 5 rows.\n    *   Pixels shifted off the bottom edge of the grid are removed. The original positions of the shifted pixels become white (background).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, but with all pixels set to the background color (white, 0), preserving the original dimensions.\n    2.  Identify the color of the pixel at the top-left corner (row 0, column 0) of the input grid. Call this the `anchor_color`.\n    3.  Determine the vertical shift amount (`shift`) based on the `anchor_color` using the following mapping:\n        *   If `anchor_color` is maroon (9), `shift` is 0.\n        *   If `anchor_color` is yellow (4), `shift` is 3.\n        *   If `anchor_color` is magenta (6), `shift` is 2.\n        *   If `anchor_color` is orange (7), `shift` is 5.\n        *   (Assume `shift` is 0 for any other anchor color not observed in the examples).\n    4.  Copy the `anchor_color` pixel from the input grid's position (0, 0) to the output grid's position (0, 0).\n    5.  Iterate through each pixel in the input grid, starting from row 0, column 1 (skipping the anchor pixel if it's at (0,0)) or more generally, iterate through all pixels *not* at (0,0).\n    6.  For each input pixel at `(row, col)` that is not the anchor pixel (i.e., `(row, col) != (0, 0)`) and is not the background color (white, 0):\n        a.  Calculate the target row index in the output grid: `new_row = row + shift`.\n        b.  The target column index remains the same: `new_col = col`.\n        c.  Check if the target position `(new_row, new_col)` is within the bounds of the output grid.\n        d.  If it is within bounds, set the pixel at `(new_row, new_col)` in the output grid to the color of the input pixel at `(row, col)`."
