"""
The transformation identifies the central horizontal and vertical blue dividing lines 
in the input grid. It then performs two independent reflection operations across 
the vertical divider:
1. The content of the top-left quadrant (area above the horizontal divider and 
   left of the vertical divider) is reflected horizontally and replaces the 
   content of the top-right quadrant in the output.
2. The content of the bottom-right quadrant (area below the horizontal divider and 
   right of the vertical divider) is reflected horizontally and replaces the 
   content of the bottom-left quadrant in the output.
The original content of the top-left and bottom-right quadrants, as well as the 
dividing lines themselves, remain unchanged in the output grid. The output grid 
is initialized as a copy of the input grid, and then the target quadrants are 
overwritten with the reflected content.
