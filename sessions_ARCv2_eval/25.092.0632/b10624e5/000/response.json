            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are square (27x27 in the examples) and predominantly filled with a yellow background (color 4).\n2.  **Dividers:** A central horizontal blue line (color 1) and a central vertical blue line (color 1) divide the grid into four distinct quadrants. These lines persist unchanged from input to output.\n3.  **Quadrant Content:** Each quadrant can contain distinct objects composed of various colors (red, green, azure, maroon, blue, etc.) or be empty (containing only the yellow background).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves reflecting content between quadrants across the central vertical blue line, but the direction of reflection depends on whether the quadrant is in the top or bottom half of the grid.\n    *   **Top Half:** The content of the top-left quadrant is reflected horizontally into the top-right quadrant. The original content of the top-right quadrant is discarded. The top-left quadrant remains unchanged.\n    *   **Bottom Half:** The content of the bottom-right quadrant is reflected horizontally into the bottom-left quadrant. The original content of the bottom-left quadrant is discarded. The bottom-right quadrant remains unchanged.\n5.  **Object Integrity:** The reflection preserves the shapes and colors of the objects within the reflected quadrants.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
