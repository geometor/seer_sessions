## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of colored pixels. The background color is primarily magenta (6), sometimes with maroon (9) lines acting as dividers.
2.  **Key Objects:** The main objects of interest are contiguous areas enclosed by white (0) pixels. Inside these enclosures, we find pixels of gray (5) and orange (7).
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation primarily occurs *within* the white-enclosed areas. Specifically, it involves an interaction between orange (7) pixels and gray (5) pixels.
4.  **Interaction Rule:** If a connected component of gray (5) pixels (connected orthogonally or diagonally) is adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to *any* orange (7) pixel within the same white-enclosed area, then *all* pixels belonging to that gray component change their color to orange (7).
5.  **Connectivity:** Adjacency and connectivity (8-way, including diagonals) are crucial for determining which gray pixels are affected. A gray component is treated as a single unit for the color change.
6.  **No Interaction:** Gray components within a white enclosure that are *not* adjacent to any orange pixel within that same enclosure remain unchanged. Pixels outside the white enclosures (background, dividing lines, etc.) also remain unchanged.
7.  **Anomalies:** Examples `train_1` and `train_3` show some changes outside the white-enclosed areas (specifically in row 2 of both outputs) and an anomalous change within a white area in `train_1` (pixel (3,1)) that don't fit the primary interaction rule identified. These might be errors in the provided examples or indicate a secondary, less obvious rule. However, the orange-gray interaction within white boundaries is consistent across all relevant areas in `train_2`, `train_3`, and one area of `train_1`. The plan focuses on this dominant, consistent pattern.

## Facts

yaml
Input_Output_Relationship:
  - Description: The output grid is derived from the input grid by selectively changing the color of some gray pixels to orange based on their proximity to existing orange pixels within specific regions.
  - Grid_Dimensions: Input and output grids have the same dimensions in all examples.

Objects:
  - Type: Enclosure
    Properties:
      - Color: White (0)
      - Shape: Variable, forms closed boundaries.
      - Role: Defines regions where the transformation occurs.
  - Type: Background
    Properties:
      - Color: Primarily Magenta (6)
      - Role: Fills the space outside enclosures and structural lines.
  - Type: Dividers
    Properties:
      - Color:

Transformation Rule:

The primary transformation identifies connected components of gray pixels (color 5) using 8-way connectivity (including diagonals). 
For each distinct gray component found in the input grid:
1. Check all pixels that are orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any pixel within that gray component.
2. If any of these adjacent pixels in the input grid has the color orange (7), then all pixels belonging to that specific gray component are changed to orange (7) in the output grid.
3. If a gray component has no adjacent orange pixels, it remains unchanged in the output grid.
4. All other pixels (background, white borders, pixels of other colors not involved in this interaction) retain their original color from the input grid.

Note: This rule addresses the consistent gray-to-orange conversion observed. Some examples contain additional changes (e.g., near borders or involving other colors) that are not covered by this primary rule and might represent noise or a secondary, less clear transformation. This implementation focuses on the dominant gray/orange interaction.

## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the gray-to-orange color change based on adjacency to orange pixels. However, the code implementing this rule failed on all examples because it did not account for a significant **movement** or **shifting** of distinct regions within the grid. The discrepancies observed in the test results (large numbers of pixels off, structural differences) strongly indicate that a spatial transformation occurs *in addition* to the color change.

The strategy must now incorporate this movement. The key appears to lie in how maroon (9) pixels/lines interact with regions defined by white (0) enclosures. The transformation seems to be a two-stage process:

1.  **Color Interaction:** Connected components of gray (5) pixels change to orange (7) if they are adjacent (8-way) to *any* orange (7) pixel in the original input grid.
2.  **Region Movement:** Specific regions, often corresponding to the bounding boxes of white (0) enclosures, are translated (shifted) horizontally or vertically. The trigger and parameters (direction, magnitude) of this shift seem related to the location of nearby maroon (9) lines relative to the region. The space vacated by the moved region is filled with the background color (magenta, 6).

Refining the natural language program requires codifying the rules for identifying the movable regions and determining their specific shift vectors based on the maroon line configurations.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's analyze each example to understand the movement and interaction:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** 8x8 grid. White enclosure bounds: approx. `rows 3-7`, `cols 0-4` and `rows 4-7`, `cols 5-8`. Orange at `(5,6)`. Gray components at `(4,1)...(6,2)` and `(6,6)`. Maroon lines in rows 1 and 2.
*   **Interaction:** Gray component `(4,1)...` is adjacent (e.g., `(5,2)` to `(5,6)`) to orange `(5,6)`. Gray `(6,6)` is adjacent to orange `(5,6)`. Both should turn orange.
*   **Movement:** The block roughly corresponding to `Input[2:8, :]` appears shifted up by 1 row to `Output[1:7, :]`. Row 2 `(9 9 9 9 6 9 9 9)` seems to overwrite Row 1. The original Row 7 `(0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0)` moves to Row 6. The new Row 7 is filled with magenta `(6)`.
*   **Expected Output Analysis:** `Output[3,1]` is orange (correctly predicted interaction from `Input[4,1]`). `Output[5,6]` is orange (correctly predicted interaction from `Input[6,6]`). The overall block `Input[2:8, :]` shifted up by 1.
*   **Code Discrepancy:** Code only performed interaction, not movement. It correctly changed `Input[6,6]` to 7 but missed `Input[4,1]` because its adjacency check might have been flawed or the interaction rule was initially misinterpretated (e.g., confined to enclosures). The lack of movement accounts for most errors.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** 17x17 grid. Multiple enclosures and maroon lines/pixels.
*   **Interaction:** Gray component `Input[13:16, 7:12]` is adjacent to orange `Input[13,6], Input[14,6], Input[14,7]`. This component should turn orange. Other gray components are not adjacent to orange.
*   **Movement:**
    *   Block 1 (approx. `Input[1:4, 9:16]`): Near maroon column 9. Shifts left by 3 (`Output[1:4, 6:13]`).
    *   Block 2 (approx. `Input[6:10, 2:10]`): Near maroon column 9. Shifts right by 7 (`Output[6:10, 9:17]`).
    *   Block 3 (approx. `Input[12:16, 4:13]`): Near maroon column 4. Shifts left by 4 (`Output[12:16, 0:9]`).
*   **Expected Output Analysis:** The predicted gray-to-orange change occurs within Block 3, and this block correctly appears shifted left by 4 in the output (`Output[13:16, 3:8]` are orange). The other blocks also shift as described.
*   **Code Discrepancy:** Code performed interaction *without* movement. It correctly identified and changed the gray component in Block 3 but placed it in the original input location, leading to massive discrepancies due to the missed shifts of all three blocks.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** 12x12 grid. Two main enclosed areas. Maroon lines in columns 5 and 10, and rows 2, 6, 8, 11.
*   **Interaction:** Gray component `Input[3:6, 1:3]` is adjacent to orange `Input[3,3], Input[4,3]`. This component should turn orange. The orange area `Input[9:11, 4:9]` has no adjacent gray pixels.
*   **Movement:**
    *   Block 1 (approx. `Input[2:7, 0:5]`): Left of maroon column 5. Shifts right by 5 (`Output[2:7, 5:10]`).
    *   Block 2 (approx. `Input[8:12, 0:11]`): Spans multiple maroon lines. No shift (`Output[8:12, 0:11]`).
*   **Expected Output Analysis:** The gray component in Block 1 changes to orange, and the entire block shifts right by 5. Block 2 remains unchanged. This matches the expected output.
*   **Code Discrepancy:** Code performed the interaction correctly within Block 1 but failed to move the block, placing the changed pixels in the original `Input[3:6, 1:3]` location instead of the correct `Output[3
