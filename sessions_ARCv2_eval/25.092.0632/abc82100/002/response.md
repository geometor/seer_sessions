**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis identified several distinct transformation rules based on the unique colors present in the input grids. However, the execution results show that the implementation failed for all examples, indicating errors in either the rule interpretation, the identification of features (like single pixels or largest objects), or the execution logic (swaps, pattern application).

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-analyze each failed example against its expected output, focusing on the discrepancies.
2.  Use code execution (metrics gathering) to rigorously verify assumptions about object properties (single pixels, largest object, connectivity) and pattern shapes.
3.  Refine the natural language description and implementation details for each conditional rule based on the new evidence. Pay close attention to details like connectivity (4-way vs 8-way), the exact definition of features triggering rules (e.g., "single red pixel"), the precise nature of swaps (pixel vs object vs local propagation), and the exact patterns used.
