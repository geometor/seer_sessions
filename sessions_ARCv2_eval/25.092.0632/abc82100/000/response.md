Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

The task involves transforming input grids based on the colors present and their arrangements. Across the examples, the color azure (8) seems to play a significant but varying role. Sometimes it's removed, sometimes its shape is preserved but recolored, and sometimes it triggers a pattern replacement. The transformations range from simple color swaps/removals on a pixel-wise basis to shape preservation/recoloring based on global properties (like single pixels) and complex pattern replacements centered on specific input colors. There appear to be distinct modes of operation, potentially triggered by the specific collection of colors present in the input or the existence of unique features like single-pixel objects.

1.  **Example 1:** The largest object (azure L-shape) has its color changed to the color of the unique single-pixel object (red). All other non-white objects are removed.
2.  **Example 2:** Azure pixels are removed. A color swap occurs between pairs: red (2) swaps with yellow (4), and magenta (6) swaps with orange (7). This is a pixel-wise operation for the swapping colors.
3.  **Example 3:** Azure pixels, along with yellow (4) and blue (1) pixels, trigger the placement of 3x3 patterns in the output. Blue triggers an orange pattern, while yellow and azure trigger a red pattern. Original red (2) and orange (7) pixels are removed without triggering patterns.
4.  **Example 4:** Azure pixels are removed. A color swap occurs between blue (1) and red (2). This is a pixel-wise operation.

The core logic seems conditional, depending heavily on the set of colors present and potentially the count/color of single-pixel objects.
