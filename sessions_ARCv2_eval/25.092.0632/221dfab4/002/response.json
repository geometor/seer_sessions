            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core components: a background, a main object color, and a template object defined by shape and color found on the bottom row. It also correctly identified the color mapping (yellow -> green) and the three primary transformation rules:\n1.  Replace main-colored template shapes with green.\n2.  Replace the original yellow template shape with green.\n3.  Fill background-colored template shapes adjacent to main-colored pixels with yellow.\n\nHowever, the generated code failed significantly on both training examples, producing outputs vastly different from the expected ones. The primary issue seems to be an over-application or misapplication of Rule 3, resulting in large areas being incorrectly filled with the template color (yellow=4).\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Re-verify Identification:** Double-check the logic for identifying the background color, the template object (ensuring it captures the exact shape, not just the bounding box, although they seem identical here), and the main object color.\n2.  **Refine Rule 3 Condition:** The adjacency check (`check_adjacency`) is the most likely source of error. It needs to ensure that a *background-colored* area matching the *template shape* is edge-adjacent to a *main-colored* pixel *in the original input*. The current implementation seems logically sound but might have a subtle bug or interact incorrectly with the loop structure.\n3.  **Rule Application Order:** The current code iterates through potential top-left corners and applies rules. It starts with a copy of the input. This seems reasonable, as later rules overwrite earlier ones if coordinates overlap, but maybe the order matters more subtly. Let's ensure the conditions strictly check the *input* grid for colors and adjacency before modifying the *output* grid.\n4.  **Code Execution for Metrics:** Use tool execution to precisely measure counts and identify discrepancies.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's gather metrics for each example.\n\n"
