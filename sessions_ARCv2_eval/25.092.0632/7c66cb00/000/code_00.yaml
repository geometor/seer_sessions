task_context:
  grid_size: [30, 24] # rows, columns
  bands:
    type: horizontal
    source:
      location: top-most band containing multiple colors
      role: provides patterns/objects
      output_action: clear to source background color
    target:
      location: below source band
      structure: typically framed (border color different from background color)
      role: receives patterns from source
      properties:
        - background_color
        - frame_color
    separators: may exist as rows of uniform color between bands

objects:
  definition: contiguous block of same-colored pixels (non-background) in the source band
  properties:
    - color
    - shape (set of coordinates)
    - size (pixel count)
  relationships:
    - containment: one object can be fully enclosed within another
  filtering: enclosed objects are ignored for primary shape transfer

transformation:
  type: pattern transfer from source to target bands
  rules:
    - rule_1: # Standard Rule
        condition: target_band.background_color is NOT yellow (4)
        selection:
          - find source objects where object.color == target_band.background_color
          - filter_out_enclosed_source_objects: true
          - disambiguation (if multiple match): select the largest object by pixel count
        action:
          - if an object is selected:
              for each pixel_coord in selected_object.shape:
                output_grid[pixel_coord] = target_band.frame_color
    - rule_2: # Special Yellow Rule
        condition: target_band.background_color IS yellow (4)
        selection:
          - find all pixel_coords in source band where input_grid[pixel_coord] == yellow (4)
        action:
          - for each selected pixel_coord:
              output_grid[pixel_coord] = target_band.frame_color

output_generation:
  - start with a copy of the input grid
  - identify source and target bands, storing background and frame colors
  - identify primary source objects (non-enclosed, non-background)
  - clear the source band area in the output grid (fill with source background color)
  - for each target band:
      apply rule_1 or rule_2 based on target_band.background_color
