            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code failed significantly, producing outputs vastly different from the expected ones. The core issue was the expansion logic; it seemed to implement a simple flood fill rather than the bounded expansion observed in the examples. The expected outputs suggest a process where regions grow from initial \"seed\" pixels, but the growth is limited, likely by proximity to other seeds. Boundaries form where the influence of different seeds meets.\n\nThe key observations leading to the failure are:\n1.  **Unbounded Expansion:** The code allowed colors to spread far beyond the localized regions seen in the expected outputs.\n2.  **Boundary Handling:** The logic for handling conflicts where different color expansions meet was incorrect or missing, leading to colors overwriting each other or spreading incorrectly instead of forming boundaries (white pixels).\n3.  **Simultaneity Misinterpretation:** While the previous logic attempted simultaneous updates, the underlying mechanism didn't correctly capture the competition between expanding regions.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\nThe transformation appears to be based on assigning each white pixel to the \"nearest\" seed pixel, using Manhattan distance. Where a white pixel is equidistant from multiple seeds with *different effective fill colors*, it remains white, forming a boundary.\n\n1.  **Identify Seeds and Effective Colors:** As before, find all non-white pixels and determine their effective fill color (magenta 6 -> orange 7, others unchanged).\n2.  **Calculate Distances:** For every pixel in the grid, calculate the Manhattan distance to *all* seed pixels.\n3.  **Determine Closest Seed(s):** For each pixel, find the minimum distance calculated in the previous step. Identify all seeds that are at this minimum distance.\n4.  **Assign Color:**\n    *   If the pixel was originally a seed, keep its original color.\n    *   If the pixel was originally white:\n        *   Check the *effective fill colors* of all seeds at the minimum distance.\n        *   If all closest seeds have the *same* effective fill color, assign that color to the pixel.\n        *   If the closest seeds have *different* effective fill colors, leave the pixel white (0).\n5.  **Final Correction (Redundant but Safe):** Ensure original seed locations retain their original input color in the final grid (this should be handled by step 4, but provides robustness).\n\nThis distance-based approach should create the observed bounded regions and handle conflicts correctly.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's gather some basic metrics to confirm understanding.\n\n"

For each seed, store its location `(r, c)`, its `original_color` (the color in the input grid, 1-9), and its `effective_fill_color` (which is orange (7) if the `original_color` is magenta (6), otherwise it's the same as the `original_color`).\n2.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros (white).\n3.  Iterate through each pixel location `(r, c)` in the grid.\n4.  For the current pixel `(r, c)`:\n    a.  Check if this location corresponds to one of the seed pixels identified in step 1.\n    b.  If it is a seed pixel location, set the color of the output grid at `(r, c)` to the `original_color` of that seed and proceed to the next pixel location (skip steps 4c-4e).\n    c.  If it is not a seed pixel location (i.e., it was white in the input):\n        i.  Calculate the Manhattan distance `d = abs(r - sr) + abs(c - sc)` from `(r, c)` to every seed pixel `(sr, sc)` in the list from step 1.\n        ii. Find the minimum distance (`min_dist`) among all calculated distances.\n        iii. Create a list of the `effective_fill_color`s of all seeds that are exactly `min_dist` away from `(r, c)`.\n        iv. Examine the list of `effective_fill_color`s from the closest seeds:\n            *   If the list is empty (should not happen if there's at least one seed), leave the output pixel white (0).\n            *   If the list contains only one unique `effective_fill_color`, set the color of the output grid at `(r, c)` to that unique color.\n            *   If the list contains two or more *different* unique `effective_fill_color`s (indicating a tie in distance between competing colors), leave the output pixel white (0).\n5.
