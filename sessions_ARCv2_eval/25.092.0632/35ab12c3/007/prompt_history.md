*   **Perception**: The task involves transforming an input grid containing scattered, single-colored pixels (or small groups of pixels) on a white background into an output grid where these initial pixels have "expanded" outwards, filling the surrounding white space. The expansion seems to follow specific rules:
    *   Each non-white pixel in the input acts as a "seed".
    *   These seeds expand into adjacent (cardinal directions: up, down, left, right) white pixels.
    *   The expansion continues iteratively until no more white pixels can be filled.
    *   The expansion from one seed stops when it meets the boundary of the grid, an existing non-white pixel from the input, or the expansion area of another seed.
    *   Crucially, the color used for expansion (the "fill color") is usually the same as the seed color, *except* for magenta (6) seeds, which expand using orange (7). All other colors (blue, red, green, yellow, gray, orange, azure, maroon) expand using their own color.
    *   The process appears to be simultaneous for all seeds, meaning expansions happen in parallel, respecting each other's boundaries as they form.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml

          location: (row, column)
      - type: expansion_area
        description: The region filled by the expansion process originating from one or more seed pixels of the same effective fill color.
        properties:
          fill_color: integer 1-9 (determined by seed color)

    relationships:
      - type: adjacency
        description: Pixels can be adjacent cardinally (sharing an edge) or diagonally (sharing a corner). Cardinal adjacency is relevant for expansion.
      - type: boundary
        description: Expansion stops at grid edges or pixels belonging to a different expansion area or original non-white pixels.

    actions:
      - name: identify_seeds
        description: Find all pixels in the input grid with colors 1 through 9.
      - name: determine_fill_color
        description: Assign a fill color to each seed. Magenta (6) seeds get orange (7). All other seeds get their own color.
      - name: expand_simultaneously
        description: Iteratively fill adjacent white (0) pixels with the determined fill color.
        details:
          - Start with the seed pixels considered filled.
          - In each step, identify all white pixels cardinally adjacent to any currently filled pixel.
          - For each identified white pixel, check the fill colors of its adjacent filled neighbors.
          - If all adjacent filled neighbors belong to the *same* fill color group, color the white pixel with that fill color.
          - If adjacent filled neighbors belong to *different* fill color groups, the white pixel remains white (boundary).
          - Repeat until no more white pixels can be colored in a step.

    state_changes:
      - description: White (0) pixels in the input grid are changed to non-zero colors based on the expansion rules.
      - description: Original non-white pixels remain unchanged in color and location.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify all non-white pixels (colors 1-9) in the input grid. These are the initial "seed" pixels.
    3.  Create a mapping of seed locations to their "fill color". If a seed pixel has color magenta (6), its fill color is orange (7). Otherwise, its fill color is its own color.
    4.  Create a set of "active" pixels, initially containing the locations of all seed pixels.
    5.  Start an iterative expansion process:
        a.  Initialize an empty set for `next_active_pixels` and a dictionary `potential_fills` mapping coordinates `(r, c)` to a set of fill colors proposing to fill that coordinate.
        b.  For each pixel location `(r, c)` in the `active` set:
            i.  Get the fill color `fill_c` associated with this active pixel (determined in step 3).
            ii. Check its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right).
            iii. For each neighbor `(nr, nc)` that is within the grid boundaries and is currently white (0) in the output grid:
                *   Add `fill_c` to the set associated with `(nr, nc)` in the `potential_fills` dictionary. If the key `(nr, nc)` doesn't exist, create it with a new set containing `fill_c`.
        c.  Iterate through the `potential_fills` dictionary:
            i.  For each coordinate `(r, c)` and its associated set of proposed fill colors `colors_set`:
                *   If `colors_set` contains exactly one color `fill_c`:
                    *   Change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to `fill_c`.
                    *   Add `(r, c)` to the `next_active_pixels` set.
        d.  If `next_active_pixels` is empty, the expansion is complete; break the loop.
        e.  Otherwise, update `active` to be `next_active_pixels` and continue to the next iteration (step 5a).
    6.  Return the final state of the output grid.

Transformation Rule Description:

1.  Identify non-white pixels (colors 1-9) in the input grid; these are "seeds".
2.  Determine the "effective fill color" for each seed: 
    - If a seed's color is magenta (6), its effective fill color is orange (7).
    - Otherwise, the effective fill color is the seed's own color.
3.  Initialize an output grid, initially identical to the input grid. Maintain a separate grid to track the effective fill color associated with each non-white cell.
4.  Iteratively expand the effective fill colors into adjacent white (0) cells based on a simultaneous update rule:
    a. In each iteration, identify all white cells.
    b. For each white cell, examine its cardinally adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right).
    c. Collect the effective fill colors of all non-white neighbors.
    d. If a white cell has at least one non-white neighbor AND all of its non-white neighbors share the *exact same* effective fill color, then schedule this white cell to be filled with that color in the next step.
    e. If a white cell's non-white neighbors have different effective fill colors, or if it has no non-white neighbors, it remains white.
    f. After checking all white cells, update all scheduled cells simultaneously. Update both the output grid (with the fill color) and the effective fill color tracking grid.
5.  Repeat the expansion iteration until no white cells can be filled in a full pass.
6.  Final Correction: After the expansion process is complete, iterate through the original input grid. For every position `(r, c)` that contained a non-white pixel in the input, ensure the corresponding pixel in the final output grid has the *original* input color. This specifically corrects cases where a magenta (6) seed's location might have been visually colored orange (7) during expansion.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code failed significantly, producing outputs vastly different from the expected ones. The core issue was the expansion logic; it seemed to implement a simple flood fill rather than the bounded expansion observed in the examples. The expected outputs suggest a process where regions grow from initial "seed" pixels, but the growth is limited, likely by proximity to other seeds. Boundaries form where the influence of different seeds meets.

The key observations leading to the failure are:
1.  **Unbounded Expansion:** The code allowed colors to spread far beyond the localized regions seen in the expected outputs.
2.  **Boundary Handling:** The logic for handling conflicts where different color expansions meet was incorrect or missing, leading to colors overwriting each other or spreading incorrectly instead of forming boundaries (white pixels).
3.  **Simultaneity Misinterpretation:** While the previous logic attempted simultaneous updates, the underlying mechanism didn't correctly capture the competition between expanding regions.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

The transformation appears to be based on assigning each white pixel to the "nearest" seed pixel, using Manhattan distance. Where a white pixel is equidistant from multiple seeds with *different effective fill colors*, it remains white, forming a boundary.

1.  **Identify Seeds and Effective Colors:** As before, find all non-white pixels and determine their effective fill color (magenta 6 -> orange 7, others unchanged).
2.  **Calculate Distances:** For every pixel in the grid, calculate the Manhattan distance to *all* seed pixels.
3.  **Determine Closest Seed(s):** For each pixel, find the minimum distance calculated in the previous step. Identify all seeds that are at this minimum distance.
4.  **Assign Color:**
    *   If the pixel was originally a seed, keep its original color.
    *   If the pixel was originally white:
        *   Check the *effective fill colors* of all seeds at the minimum distance.
        *   If all closest seeds have the *same* effective fill color, assign that color to the pixel.
        *   If the closest seeds have *different* effective fill colors, leave the pixel white (0).
5.  **Final Correction (Redundant but Safe):** Ensure original seed locations retain their original input color in the final grid (this should be handled by step 4, but provides robustness).

This distance-based approach should create the observed bounded regions and handle conflicts correctly.

## Facts


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      height: variable (e.g., 20, 18, 15)
      width: variable (e.g., 20, 18, 15)
      pixels: integers 0-9, representing colors. 0 is white (background).
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer 0-9
      location: (row, column) coordinates
  - type: seed_pixel
    description: A non-white (color 1-9) pixel in the input grid. Acts as an origin for expansion.
    properties:
      original_color: integer 1-9 (The color seen in the input grid)
      effective_fill_color: integer 1-9 (The color used for expansion/distance competition. Orange(7) if original_color is magenta(6), otherwise same as original_color)
      location: (row, column)
  - type: region
    description: An area in the output grid associated with a single effective_fill_color, determined by proximity to seed pixels.
    properties:
      fill_color: The effective_fill_color of the seed(s) defining the region.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Cardinal adjacency (sharing an edge) is implicitly used in distance calculations (Manhattan distance).
  - type: proximity (Manhattan Distance)
    description: The distance between two pixels (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) is abs(r1 - r2) + abs(c1 - c2). This determines which seed influences a given white pixel.
  - type: boundary
    description: Occurs at pixels equidistant from two or more seeds with different effective_fill_colors. These pixels remain white (0). Also occurs at grid edges.

actions:
  - name: identify_seeds_and_effective_colors
    description: Find all non-white pixels in the input. For each seed, record its location, original color, and effective fill color (6->7, others same).
  - name: calculate_minimum_distances_and_owners
    description: For every pixel (r, c) in the grid, calculate its Manhattan distance to all seeds. Find the minimum distance. Identify all seeds achieving this minimum distance.
  - name: determine_pixel_color
    description: Assign a color to each pixel (r, c) in the output grid based on the closest seed(s).
    details:
      - If pixel (r, c) was originally a seed (input color != 0), its output color is its original_color.
      - If pixel (r, c) was originally white (input color == 0):
        - Get the effective_fill_colors of all seeds identified as closest in the previous step.
        - If there is only one unique effective_fill_color among the closest seeds, set the output pixel color to this effective_fill_color.
        - If there are multiple different effective_fill_colors among the closest seeds (a tie), set the output pixel color to white (0).
  - name: construct_output_grid
    description: Create the output grid by applying the determined pixel color for every location.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a list of all "seed" pixels from the input grid. For each seed, store its location `(r, c)`, its `original_color` (the color in the input grid, 1-9), and its `effective_fill_color` (which is orange (7) if the `original_color` is magenta (6), otherwise it's the same as the `original_color`).
2.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros (white).
3.  Iterate through each pixel location `(r, c)` in the grid.
4.  For the current pixel `(r, c)`:
    a.  Check if this location corresponds to one of the seed pixels identified in step 1.
    b.  If it is a seed pixel location, set the color of the output grid at `(r, c)` to the `original_color` of that seed and proceed to the next pixel location (skip steps 4c-4e).
    c.  If it is not a seed pixel location (i.e., it was white in the input):
        i.  Calculate the Manhattan distance `d = abs(r - sr) + abs(c - sc)` from `(r, c)` to every seed pixel `(sr, sc)` in the list from step 1.
        ii. Find the minimum distance (`min_dist`) among all calculated distances.
        iii. Create a list of the `effective_fill_color`s of all seeds that are exactly `min_dist` away from `(r, c)`.
        iv. Examine the list of `effective_fill_color`s from the closest seeds:
            *   If the list is empty (should not happen if there's at least one seed), leave the output pixel white (0).
            *   If the list contains only one unique `effective_fill_color`, set the color of the output grid at `(r, c)` to that unique color.
            *   If the list contains two or more *different* unique `effective_fill_color`s (indicating a tie in distance between competing colors), leave the output pixel white (0).
5.  Return the completed output grid.
