*   **Perception**: The task involves transforming an input grid containing scattered, single-colored pixels (or small groups of pixels) on a white background into an output grid where these initial pixels have "expanded" outwards, filling the surrounding white space. The expansion seems to follow specific rules:
    *   Each non-white pixel in the input acts as a "seed".
    *   These seeds expand into adjacent (cardinal directions: up, down, left, right) white pixels.
    *   The expansion continues iteratively until no more white pixels can be filled.
    *   The expansion from one seed stops when it meets the boundary of the grid, an existing non-white pixel from the input, or the expansion area of another seed.
    *   Crucially, the color used for expansion (the "fill color") is usually the same as the seed color, *except* for magenta (6) seeds, which expand using orange (7). All other colors (blue, red, green, yellow, gray, orange, azure, maroon) expand using their own color.
    *   The process appears to be simultaneous for all seeds, meaning expansions happen in parallel, respecting each other's boundaries as they form.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - type: grid
        properties:
          height: variable (e.g., 20, 18, 15)

          pixels: represented by integers 0-9
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          color: integer 0-9 (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon)
          location: (row, column) coordinates
      - type: seed_pixel
        description: A non-white (color 1-9) pixel in the input grid.
        properties:
          color: integer 1-9
          location: (row, column)
      - type: expansion_area
        description: The region filled by the expansion process originating from one or more seed pixels of the same effective fill color.
        properties:
          fill_color: integer 1-9 (determined by seed color)

    relationships:
      - type: adjacency
        description: Pixels can be adjacent cardinally (sharing an edge) or diagonally (sharing a corner). Cardinal adjacency is relevant for expansion.
      - type: boundary
        description: Expansion stops at grid edges or pixels belonging to a different expansion area or original non-white pixels.

    actions:
      - name: identify_seeds
        description: Find all pixels in the input grid with colors 1 through 9.
      - name: determine_fill_color
        description: Assign a fill color to each seed. Magenta (6) seeds get orange (7). All other seeds get their own color.
      - name: expand_simultaneously
        description: Iteratively fill adjacent white (0) pixels with the determined fill color.
        details:
          - Start with the seed pixels considered filled.
          - In each step, identify all white pixels cardinally adjacent to any currently filled pixel.
          - For each identified white pixel, check the fill colors of its adjacent filled neighbors.
          - If all adjacent filled neighbors belong to the *same* fill color group, color the white pixel with that fill color.
          - If adjacent filled neighbors belong to *different* fill color groups, the white pixel remains white (boundary).
          - Repeat until no more white pixels can be colored in a step.

    state_changes:
      - description: White (0) pixels in the input grid are changed to non-zero colors based on the expansion rules.
      - description: Original non-white pixels remain unchanged in color and location.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify all non-white pixels (colors 1-9) in the input grid. These are the initial "seed" pixels.
    3.  Create a mapping of seed locations to their "fill color". If a seed pixel has color magenta (6), its fill color is orange (7). Otherwise, its fill color is its own color.
    4.  Create a set of "active" pixels, initially containing the locations of all seed pixels.
    5.  Start an iterative expansion process:
        a.  Initialize an empty set for `next_active_pixels` and a dictionary `potential_fills` mapping coordinates `(r, c)` to a set of fill colors proposing to fill that coordinate.
        b.  For each pixel location `(r, c)` in the `active` set:
            i.  Get the fill color `fill_c` associated with this active pixel (determined in step 3).
            ii. Check its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right).
            iii. For each neighbor `(nr, nc)` that is within the grid boundaries and is currently white (0) in the output grid:
                *   Add `fill_c` to the set associated with `(nr, nc)` in the `potential_fills` dictionary. If the key `(nr, nc)` doesn't exist, create it with a new set containing `fill_c`.
        c.  Iterate through the `potential_fills` dictionary:
            i.  For each coordinate `(r, c)` and its associated set of proposed fill colors `colors_set`:
                *   If `colors_set` contains exactly one color `fill_c`:
                    *   Change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to `fill_c`.
                    *   Add `(r, c)` to the `next_active_pixels` set.
        d.  If `next_active_pixels` is empty, the expansion is complete; break the loop.
        e.  Otherwise, update `active` to be `next_active_pixels` and continue to the next iteration (step 5a).
    6.  Return the final state of the output grid.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code attempt failed significantly on all training examples. The transformed outputs show excessive filling, incorrect boundary formation, and color bleeding, indicating a fundamental misunderstanding or incorrect implementation of the expansion mechanism. The core concept of simultaneous expansion, where different color zones grow concurrently and stop where they meet, was not captured correctly. The code seems to perform something closer to independent flood fills originating from each seed, overwriting or ignoring conflict zones.

The strategy moving forward is to:
1.  Re-analyze the examples focusing specifically on how boundaries between different color zones form.
2.  Gather detailed metrics to quantify the differences between expected and actual outputs.
3.  Refine the `facts` and `natural language program` to precisely describe the simultaneous expansion and boundary conflict resolution (leaving the conflicting pixel white).
4.  The implementation needs to ensure that in each step of the expansion, all potential white cells to be filled are identified, conflicts are resolved (cells adjacent to multiple distinct fill colors remain white), and only then the grid is updated for that step.

**Metrics Gathering:**

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_grid(grid_name, grid):
    if grid is None:
        print(f"{grid_name}: None")
        return {}
    height, width = grid.shape
    non_white_pixels = np.count_nonzero(grid)
    colors, counts = np.unique(grid[grid != 0], return_counts=True)
    color_counts = dict(zip(colors, counts))
    return {
        "name": grid_name,
        "shape": (height, width),
        "non_white_pixels": non_white_pixels,

**Observations from Metrics:**

*   **Shape:** The shapes of the transformed outputs match the expected outputs, which is correct.
*   **Non-white Pixels:** The number of non-white pixels in the transformed outputs is vastly higher than in the expected outputs (e.g., 385 vs 80 in Ex1, 301 vs 36 in Ex2, 211 vs 106 in Ex3). This confirms the overfilling observation.
*   **Color Counts:**
    *   The counts for each specific color are significantly different between the transformed and expected outputs.
    *   Crucially, the transformed outputs sometimes contain colors that were not present in the *expected* output (though they might have been seeds or intermediate fill colors). For example, in Ex1, the transformed output has 3 magenta (6) pixels, while the expected output has 11. This suggests the original magenta pixels might not be getting correctly overwritten/incorporated into the orange (7) expansion area in the failed code. The expected output *does* retain the original magenta pixel at (2,7) and the ones at (8,13), (6,11), (6,3) -> (4,6), (5,4), (4,9), (5,11), (3,8), but the code is leaving others behind or placing them incorrectly. Wait, re-reading the expected output for Ex1, *only* the original magenta seeds remain magenta, the expansion is purely orange. The code gets this partly wrong.
    *   The counts for orange (7) are very high in the transformed outputs (101, 100, 92) compared to expected (11, 0, 20). This is likely because the magenta->orange rule is applied, but the expansion itself is uncontrolled.
    *   Other color counts are also skewed, indicating incorrect expansion boundaries.

```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      height: variable
      width: variable
      pixels: represented by integers 0-9 (white to maroon)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer 0-9
      location: (row, column) coordinates
  - type: seed_pixel
    description: A non-white (color 1-9) pixel in the input grid.
    properties:
      color: integer 1-9
      location: (row, column)
  - type: expansion_area
    description: The region potentially filled by the expansion process originating from one or more seed pixels of the same effective fill color.
    properties:
      fill_color: integer 1-9 (determined by seed color; 6->7, others unchanged)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are cardinally adjacent if they share an edge. This is used for expansion.
  - type: boundary
    description: Formed at grid edges, original non-white pixels, or where expansions from different fill colors meet. Pixels where different expansions meet remain white (0).

actions:
  - name: initialize_grids
    description: Create an output grid (copy of input) and a 'fill_color_grid' (same shape, initialized to 0).
  - name: identify_seeds_and_populate_grids
    description: Iterate through the input grid. If a pixel (r, c) has color 'C' (1-9), set output_grid[r, c] = C. Determine its fill_color 'F' (7 if C=6, else C). Set fill_color_grid[r, c] = F.
  - name: iterative_simultaneous_expansion
    description: Repeat the following steps until no changes occur in an iteration:
    details:
      - Initialize an empty dictionary `updates_this_step` to store `{ (r, c): fill_color }`.
      - Iterate through every white pixel `(r, c)` in the current `output_grid`.
      - For each white pixel `(r, c)`, find its cardinally adjacent non-white neighbors `(nr, nc)`.
      - Collect the *fill colors* of these neighbors using the `fill_color_grid`: `neighbor_fill_colors = {fill_color_grid[nr, nc] for (nr, nc) in non_white_neighbors if output_grid[nr, nc] != 0}`.
      - If `neighbor_fill_colors` is not empty AND contains exactly one unique fill color `single_fill_color`:
          - Add `(r, c): single_fill_color` to `updates_this_step`.
      - After checking all white pixels, if `updates_this_step` is empty, break the loop (expansion complete).
      - Otherwise, apply the updates: For each `(r, c), fill_c` in `updates_this_step`:
          - Set `output_grid[r, c] = fill_c`.
          - Set `fill_color_grid[r, c] = fill_c`.

state_changes:
  - description: White (0) pixels in the output grid are changed iteratively to non-zero fill colors based on the simultaneous expansion rules.
  - description: Pixels adjacent to areas expanding with different fill colors remain white (0).
  - description: Original non-white pixels from the input grid retain their original color in the output grid, but their associated fill color (potentially different, e.g., 6->7) is used for propagation in the fill_color_grid.

**Refined Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create two grids: `output_grid` initialized as a copy of the `input_grid`, and `fill_color_grid` of the same dimensions initialized with zeros.
2.  Iterate through the `input_grid`. For each pixel at `(r, c)` with a non-white color `C`:
    *   Determine its effective `fill_color`: `F = 7` if `C == 6`, otherwise `F = C`.
    *   Store this effective color in the `fill_color_grid` at `(r, c)`: `fill_color_grid[r, c] = F`.
    *   Ensure the original color remains in the `output_grid`: `output_grid[r, c] = C`. (This step is implicitly handled by copying the input initially, but emphasizes that original pixels keep their visual color).
3.  Start an iterative expansion process. Continue looping as long as changes are made in a full iteration.
    a.  Initialize an empty list or dictionary called `pending_updates` to store `((r, c), fill_color)` pairs for pixels to be colored in this step.
    b.  Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` in the grid.
    c.  If `output_grid[r, c]` is white (0):
        i.   Find all cardinally adjacent neighbor coordinates `(nr, nc)` that are within grid bounds and are *not* white (`output_grid[nr, nc] != 0`).
        ii.  Collect the *fill colors* associated with these non-white neighbors from the `fill_color_grid`: `neighbor_fills = {fill_color_grid[nr, nc] for (nr, nc) in non_white_neighbors}`.
        iii. If the set `neighbor_fills` contains exactly one unique color `single_fill_color`:
            *   Add the update `((r, c), single_fill_color)` to `pending_updates`.
    d.  After checking all cells, check if `pending_updates` is empty. If it is, break the loop (expansion is complete).
    e.  If `pending_updates` is not empty, apply all updates simultaneously: For each `((r, c), fill_c)` in `pending_updates`:
        *   Set `output_grid[r, c] = fill_c`.
        *   Set `fill_color_grid[r, c] = fill_c`.
4.  Return the final `output_grid`.
