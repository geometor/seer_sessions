Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.

**1. General Assessment & Strategy**

The initial code produced outputs significantly different from the expected ones. The core logic of simultaneous expansion seems flawed in its implementation. Key issues appear to be:

*   **Incorrect Boundary Handling**: The expansion seems to bleed across areas where different colors should meet, often resulting in large, uncontrolled fills instead of distinct regions separated by white boundaries. The expected outputs show that when expansions from different "fill colors" meet, the boundary pixels often remain white (0). The previous code didn't correctly implement this conflict resolution.
*   **Fill Color vs. Visual Color**: The rule about magenta (6) expanding as orange (7) needs careful handling. The expansion logic should use orange (7) for propagation and boundary checks originating from magenta seeds, but the original magenta pixels must retain their color (6) in the final output. The previous code attempted this with a `fill_color_grid` and a final restoration step, but the expansion itself was likely incorrect, leading to the wrong areas being filled.
*   **Expansion Mechanism**: The iterative process needs to strictly adhere to the rule: a white pixel `(r, c)` is colored with color `C` in step `k+1` *if and only if* it was white in step `k`, and *all* of its non-white neighbors in step `k` have the *same fill color* `C` (where magenta seeds contribute fill color orange). If neighboring non-white cells have *different* fill colors, the cell `(r, c)` remains white.

**Strategy:**

1.  Re-analyze the expected outputs to confirm the boundary rules and the magenta->orange behavior.
2.  Gather precise metrics (color counts, palettes) to quantify the differences observed.
3.  Refine the `Facts` based on the analysis.
4.  Rewrite the `Natural Language Program` to be more precise about the expansion condition, conflict resolution (remaining white), and the handling of original seed colors versus fill colors.

**2. Metrics Gathering**

Let's use `tool_code` to get specific data about the examples.
