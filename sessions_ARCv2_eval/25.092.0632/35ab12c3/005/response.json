Determine the \"effective fill color\" for each seed: \n    - If a seed's color is magenta (6), its effective fill color is orange (7).\n    - Otherwise, the effective fill color is the seed's own color.\n3.  Initialize an output grid, initially identical to the input grid. Maintain a separate grid to track the effective fill color associated with each non-white cell.\n4.  Iteratively expand the effective fill colors into adjacent white (0) cells based on a simultaneous update rule:\n    a. In each iteration, identify all white cells.\n    b. For each white cell, examine its cardinally adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n    c. Collect the effective fill colors of all non-white neighbors.\n    d. If a white cell has at least one non-white neighbor AND all of its non-white neighbors share the *exact same* effective fill color, then schedule this white cell to be filled with that color in the next step.\n    e. If a white cell's non-white neighbors have different effective fill colors, or if it has no non-white neighbors, it remains white.\n    f. After checking all white cells, update all scheduled cells simultaneously. Update both the output grid (with the fill color) and the effective fill color tracking grid.\n5.  Repeat the expansion iteration until no white cells can be filled in a full pass.\n6.  Final Correction: After the expansion process is complete, iterate through the original input grid. For every position `(r, c)` that contained a non-white pixel in the input, ensure the corresponding pixel in the final output grid has the *original* input color. This specifically corrects cases where a magenta (6) seed's location might have been visually colored orange (7) during expansion.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by simultaneously expanding seed pixels into \n    adjacent white space according to specific fill rules, preserving original \n    seed colors in the final output.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A numpy array representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = input_grid.shape\n    \n    # Initialize output grid (copy of input) and fill color grid\n    # output_grid holds the visual colors.\n    # fill_color_grid holds the 'effective' color used for propagation rules.\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    fill_color_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid, dtype=int)\n\n    # Populate fill_color_grid based on initial seeds and ensure output has original colors\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            original_color = input_grid[r, c]\n            if original_color != 0:\n                # Determine the effective fill color for propagation\n                effective_fill_color = 7 if original_color == 6 else original_color\n                fill_color_grid[r, c] = effective_fill_color\n                # Ensure output grid starts with the original color visually\n                output_grid[r, c] = original_color \n\n    # Iterative simultaneous expansion\n    while True:\n        # Dictionary to store updates for this iteration: {(r, c): fill_color}\n        pending_updates = {}\n        \n        # Iterate through every cell to check if it's a white cell ready to be filled\n        for r in range(height):\n            for c in range(width):\n                # Consider only white cells in the current output_grid state\n                if output_grid[r, c] == 0:\n                    neighbor_effective_fills = set()\n                    has_non_white_neighbor = False\n\n                    # Check cardinal neighbors\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n\n                        # Check bounds\n                        if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                            # Check if neighbor is non-white *based on the visual output grid*\n                            if output_grid[nr, nc] != 0:\n                                has_non_white_neighbor = True\n                                # Get the effective fill color associated with this neighbor\n                                neighbor_fill = fill_color_grid[nr, nc]\n                                # It's possible a neighbor became non-white but fill_color wasn't set yet\n                                # if it was an original seed -
