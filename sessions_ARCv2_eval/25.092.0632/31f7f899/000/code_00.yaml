Grid Properties:
  - Background Color: azure (8)
  - Grid Size: Variable (e.g., 13x13, 15x15, 7x7)

Objects:
  - Type: Separator Line
    Properties:
      - Color: magenta (6)
      - Orientation: Horizontal
      - Thickness: 1 pixel
      - Role: Acts as a barrier to vertical propagation. Remains unchanged in the output.
  - Type: Propagating Pixels
    Properties:
      - Color: Any color except azure (8) and magenta (6).
      - Location: Can be anywhere except on the separator line itself.
      - Role: Source of color for vertical propagation within their column.
  - Type: Background Pixels
    Properties:
      - Color: azure (8)
      - Role: Can be replaced by propagating colors.

Relationships & Actions:
  - Action: Vertical Color Propagation
    Actor: Propagating Pixels
    Target: Background Pixels (azure 8)
    Constraint: Occurs within the same column as the source pixel.
    Direction:
      - Towards the separator line from above.
      - Towards the separator line from below.
    Rule:
      - For each column, find the non-background, non-separator pixel closest to the separator line from above. Propagate this color downwards, replacing background pixels, until the row just above the separator line.
      - For each column, find the non-background, non-separator pixel closest to the separator line from below. Propagate this color upwards, replacing background pixels, until the row just below the separator line.
    Boundary: Propagation stops at the separator line.
