Red (2) takes precedence over Blue (1). If neither Red nor Blue is present in the input grid, no changes are made, and the original grid is returned.\n2.  **Determine Susceptible Colors:** Based on the `C_trigger`, define the set of \"susceptible\" colors (`S_target`):\n    *   If `C_trigger` is Red (2), `S_target` = {Gray (5), Green (3)}.\n    *   If `C_trigger` is Blue (1), `S_target` = {Gray (5), Orange (7)}.\n3.  **Initialize Output:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid. Modifications will be made to this copy.\n4.  **Column-wise Processing:** Iterate through each column (`c`) of the grid independently.\n5.  **Identify Trigger Pixels in Column:** Find the row indices of all pixels in the current column `c` that match the `C_trigger`.\n6.  **Check Conditions for Transformation:** A transformation within the column occurs only if *all* the following conditions are met:\n    *   There are at least two `C_trigger` pixels in the column.\n    *   Let `r_min` be the row index of the *highest* `C_trigger` pixel and `r_max` be the row index of the *lowest* `C_trigger` pixel in the column.\n    *   The highest trigger pixel is not too high: `r_min >= 2`.\n    *   The vertical distance between the highest and lowest trigger pixels is sufficiently large: `r_max - r_min >= 5`.\n7.  **Apply Transformation (if conditions met):** If all conditions in step 6 are true:\n    *   Iterate through the rows `r` strictly *between* the highest and lowest trigger pixels (i.e., `r_min < r < r_max`).\n    *   For each pixel at `(r, c)`, check if its color in the *input* grid belongs to the `S_target` set.\n    *   If the pixel's color is susceptible, change the color of the corresponding pixel `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to `C_trigger`.\n8.  **Return Result:** After processing all columns, return the modified output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a transformation rule based on trigger colors (Red=2 or Blue=1) within columns.\n    Susceptible colors (Gray=5, Green=3 for Red; Gray=5, Orange=7 for Blue)\n    are changed to the trigger color between the highest and lowest trigger pixels\n    in a column, provided specific position and distance conditions are met.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for efficient processing\n    input_array = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    # Initialize output grid as a copy of the input\n    output_array = np.copy(input_array)\n    height, width = input_array.shape\n\n    trigger_color = None\n    susceptible_colors = set()\n\n    # Step 1: Identify Global Trigger Color (Red=2 > Blue=1)\n    if np.any(input_array == 2):\n        trigger_color = 2\n    elif np.any(input_array == 1):\n        trigger_color = 1\n    else:\n        # No trigger color found, return the original grid\n        return input_grid # Return original list of lists format\n\n    # Step 2: Determine Susceptible Colors\n    if trigger_color == 2:\n        susceptible_colors = {5, 3} # Gray, Green are susceptible to Red\n    elif trigger_color == 1:\n        susceptible_colors = {5, 7} # Gray, Orange are susceptible to Blue\n\n    # Step 4: Column-wise Processing\n    for c in range(width):\n        # Step 5: Identify Trigger Pixels in Column\n        trigger_indices = np.where(input_array[:, c] == trigger_color)[0]\n\n        # Step 6: Check Conditions for Transformation\n        if len(trigger_indices) >= 2:\n            r_min = np.min(trigger_"
