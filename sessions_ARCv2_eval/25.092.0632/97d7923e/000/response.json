The background is white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** While contiguous blocks of color exist, the core logic seems to operate column-wise, focusing on the vertical relationships between pixels within the same column rather than distinct multi-pixel objects.\n3.  **Colors:** Specific colors play key roles:\n    *   Red (2) and Blue (1) act as \"trigger\" or \"dominant\" colors in different examples.\n    *   Gray (5), Green (3), and Orange (7) act as \"target\" or \"susceptible\" colors that can be changed.\n    *   White (0) is the background and is ignored.\n    *   Green (3) is susceptible to Red(2) but not to Blue(1). Gray (5) is susceptible to both Red(2) and Blue(1). Orange (7) is susceptible to Blue(1).\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves changing the color of certain pixels based on the presence and position of a trigger color within the same column. Specifically, susceptible pixels *below* the lowest instance of a trigger color in a column adopt the trigger color.\n5.  **Columnar Focus:** The transformation rule is applied independently to each column of the grid. The presence and vertical position of specific colors within a column dictate the changes in that column.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Based on the examples, if Red (2) is present anywhere in the input, `C_trigger` is Red (2). Otherwise, if Blue (1) is present, `C_trigger` is Blue (1). (If neither is present, no changes occur).\n3.  Define the set of \"susceptible\" colors (`S_target`) based on the identified `C_trigger`:\n    *   If `C_trigger` is Red (2), `S_target` includes Gray (5) and Green (3).\n    *   If `C_trigger` is Blue (1), `S_target` includes Gray (5) and Orange (7).\n4.  Iterate through each column index `c` from left to right.\n5.  Within each column `c`, find the row index `r_trigger` corresponding to the *lowest* occurrence of `C_trigger`. If `C_trigger` does not exist in column `c`, proceed to the next column.\n6.  If `r_trigger` was found, iterate through all row indices `r` *below* `r_trigger` (i.e., from `r_trigger + 1` down to the last row).\n7.  For each pixel at position `(r, c)`, check if its original color (from the input grid) is present in the set `S_target`.\n8.  If the pixel's color is in `S_target`, update the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to `C_trigger`.\n9.  After processing all columns, return the final output grid."
