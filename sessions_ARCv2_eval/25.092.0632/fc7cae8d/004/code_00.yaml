Task: Extract the largest object containing the dominant internal color.

Input:
  - Grid: Input grid (e.g., 22x22).
  - Properties:
      - Contains:
          - Background Pixels: White (0).
          - Border Pixels: Form an outer frame (1-pixel thick).
          - Inner Area: The grid excluding the 1-pixel border.
          - Noise Pixels: Scattered non-background pixels, potentially inside or outside the target object's bounding box, distinct from the target object's primary color.
          - Potential Target Object(s): Contiguous areas of non-background pixels.

Identification:
  - Background Color: White (0).
  - Target Color: The non-background color with the highest frequency count within the inner area (input grid excluding the 1-pixel border).
  - Target Object Definition: The single largest contiguous component (8-way adjacency) of non-background pixels that contains *at least one pixel* of the `Target Color`.

Action:
  - Define Inner Area: Conceptually remove the outermost row/column from the input grid.
  - Find Target Color: Count frequencies of non-background colors in the inner area and identify the most frequent one (`target_color`).
  - Find Components: Identify all contiguous groups of non-background pixels in the *original* input grid.
  - Select Target Component: Filter the components to find those containing at least one pixel of `target_color`. From this filtered list, select the component with the largest number of pixels.
  - Define Bounding Box: Find the minimum rectangular area enclosing the selected target component.
  - Extract: Copy the portion of the original input grid defined by the bounding box.

Relationship:
  - The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid.
  - The content is determined by the largest connected object that incorporates the most frequent color found inside the input's border.
  - Pixels belonging to the absolute border or noise components not connected to the target object (even if they are within its bounding box area conceptually) are excluded.
