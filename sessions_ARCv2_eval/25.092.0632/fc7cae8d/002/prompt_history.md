Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The inputs are relatively large grids (around 22x22) containing various colored pixels, including a distinct border and scattered 'noise' pixels. The outputs are significantly smaller grids.
2.  **Background:** The color white (0) seems to function as the primary background color within the main area of the input grid, separating different elements.
3.  **Borders:** The input grids often have distinct borders made of single colors (yellow in train\_1, complex in train\_2, red/yellow in train\_3). These borders do not seem to directly contribute to the output grid's content, other than potentially framing the area of interest.
4.  **Noise:** Scattered pixels of various colors (often gray (5) or the border color) appear near the edges or randomly within the background area. These noise pixels are not part of the final output.
5.  **Target Object:** The core feature in each input grid is a large, contiguous or near-contiguous object composed of one or more colors (not white). This object appears to be the sole source of the output grid's content.
    *   In `train_1`, the object is primarily blue (1).
    *   In `train_2`, the object is primarily red (2).
    *   In `train_3`, the object is primarily azure (8).
6.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to be an extraction process. The task involves identifying the main, largest non-background object within the input grid, determining its spatial extent (bounding box), and copying the pixels within that bounding box to form the output grid. The relative positions of the pixels within the extracted object are preserved.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Extract the largest contiguous non-background object.

Input:
  - Grid: Input grid containing pixels of various colors.
  - Properties:
      - Dimensions: Variable (e.g., 22x22).
      - Contains:
          - Background Pixels: Predominantly white (0) in the central area.
          - Border Pixels: Frame the grid, variable colors.
          - Noise Pixels: Scattered, non-contiguous, non-background pixels, often near edges.
          - Target Object(s): Contiguous areas of non-background pixels.

Output:
  - Grid: Output grid containing the extracted object.
  - Properties:
      - Dimensions: Smaller than the input, determined by the target object's bounding box.
      - Content: Pixels corresponding exactly to the target object from the input grid.

Identification:
  - Background Color: White (0) is the relevant background for object identification (ignoring outer grid borders).
  - Target Object Definition: The single largest contiguous object composed of any color(s) *except* the background color (white). Contiguity includes adjacent (side-by-side and diagonal) pixels.

Action:
  - Find Objects: Identify all contiguous groups of non-background (non-white) pixels in the input grid.
  - Select Largest: Determine which of these objects contains the most pixels.
  - Define Bounding Box: Find the minimum rectangular area (top-left row/col, bottom-right row/col) that encloses all pixels of the selected largest object.
  - Extract: Copy the portion of the input grid defined by the bounding box.

Relationship:
  - The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid.
  - The content of the output grid is solely determined by the largest contiguous block of non-white pixels found within the input grid.
  - Borders and noise pixels in the input are ignored during the extraction process.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Define the background color as white (0).
2.  Scan the input grid to identify all contiguous groups of pixels whose color is *not* the background color (white). Consider pixels connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally as part of the same contiguous group.
3.  Calculate the size (number of pixels) of each identified contiguous group.
4.  Select the group with the largest size. If there's a tie, assume based on the examples that there will be only one largest group relevant to the task's core pattern.
5.  Determine the minimum bounding box of the selected largest group: find the minimum row index, maximum row index, minimum column index, and maximum column index occupied by the pixels of this group.
6.  Create a new output grid whose dimensions match the height (max_row - min_row + 1) and width (max_col - min_col + 1) of the bounding box.
7.  Copy the pixels from the input grid within the calculated bounding box (from `min_row`, `min_col` to `max_row`, `max_col` inclusive) into the new output grid, preserving their relative positions.
