            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial code failed because the strategy of simply selecting the largest contiguous non-background object was too simplistic. The failures across all three examples indicate that the selected component often included parts of the border or unrelated noise elements connected to the main object. The bounding boxes were consequently incorrect, leading to outputs that were the wrong size and contained extraneous colors.\n\nThe key seems to be identifying the *correct* object of interest, which might not strictly be the largest overall non-background component, but rather the largest component associated with the *primary* color or pattern found *within* the central area, excluding the immediate border noise.\n\n**Strategy Revision:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Area:** Define an \"inner grid\" by excluding the outermost 1-pixel border from the input grid. This helps ignore potential border noise when identifying the main pattern.\n2.  **Determine Target Color:** Find the most frequent non-background color within this inner grid. This color likely represents the primary constituent of the object we want to extract.\n3.  **Locate Target Object:** Find all contiguous non-background components in the *original* grid (using 8-way adjacency). Filter these components to keep only those containing at least one pixel of the determined `target_color`.\n4.  **Select Largest Relevant Object:** From the filtered list, select the component with the most pixels. This is assumed to be the object of interest.\n5.  **Extract:** Calculate the bounding box of this selected component and extract the corresponding subgrid from the original input.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
