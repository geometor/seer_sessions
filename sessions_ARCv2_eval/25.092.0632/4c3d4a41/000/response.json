            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are consistently 8 rows by 20 columns. They are visually divided into two halves: a left side (columns 0-8) and a right side (columns 9-19).\n2.  **Right Frame:** The right side contains a permanent gray (5) rectangular frame along its perimeter (row 0/col 9-19, row 7/col 9-19, col 9/row 0-7, col 19/row 0-7).\n3.  **Right Internal Columns:** Inside the frame, columns 11, 13, 15, and 17 contain vertical arrangements of colored pixels (or white pixels), separated by columns of mostly white pixels (10, 12, 14, 16, 18). These colored columns vary between examples.\n4.  **Left Gray Pixels:** The left side (columns 0-8) contains scattered gray (5) pixels. The pattern of these gray pixels differs between examples.\n5.  **Transformation - Left Side:** In the output, all gray (5) pixels originally present in columns 0-8 of the input grid are removed (changed to white (0)).\n6.  **Transformation - Right Side:** Specific pixels within the internal columns (11, 13, 15, 17) on the right side are changed to gray (5). This change appears to be triggered by the presence of gray pixels in specific columns on the *left* side of the input grid.\n7.  **Mapping:** There's a positional correspondence:\n    *   Gray pixels in input column 1 affect output column 11.\n    *   Gray pixels in input column 3 affect output column 13.\n    *   Gray pixels in input column 5 affect output column 15.\n    *   Gray pixels in input column 7 affect output column 17.\n8.  **Conditional Change:** The change to gray (5) in the target right columns (11, 13, 15, 17) only occurs if the *original* color of the target pixel in the input grid is *not* magenta (6) and *not* orange (7). If a gray pixel exists in the corresponding trigger column (1, 3, 5, or 7) on the left, but the target pixel on the right is magenta (6) or orange (7), the target pixel remains unchanged. If the target pixel is any other color (including white (0)), it changes to gray (5).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```"
