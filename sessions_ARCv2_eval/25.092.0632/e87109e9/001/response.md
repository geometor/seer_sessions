Transformation Rule:

1.  Isolate the top 6 rows as the 'Palette' and the rest as the 'Canvas'.
2.  Identify 'paintable foreground colors' from the Palette: these are non-white, non-gray colors adjacent (4-way) to white pixels within the Palette's gray border.
3.  Identify the 'paintable background color' as the most frequent color in the initial Canvas, excluding azure (8).
4.  Combine the foreground colors and the background color into a single set of 'paintable colors'.
5.  Locate all initial azure (8) pixels in the Canvas; these are the 'seeds'.
6.  Perform an 8-way connected flood fill starting from the seeds. The fill proceeds onto adjacent pixels only if their color is in the 'paintable colors' set.
7.  Pixels that are part of the fill become azure (8). Non-paintable colors act as barriers.
8.  The final output is the modified Canvas grid after the flood fill is complete.
