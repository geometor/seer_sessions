Isolate the top 6 rows of the input grid as the 'Palette' and the remaining rows as the 'Canvas'. Handle cases where the grid is too short for a standard 6-row palette.\n2.  Identify 'paintable foreground colors' from the Palette: these are colors other than white (0) and gray (5) that are directly adjacent (4-way connectivity: up, down, left, right) to a white (0) pixel within the Palette's inner area (excluding the gray border).\n3.  Identify the 'paintable background color' as the single most frequent color in the initial Canvas, excluding azure (8).\n4.  Combine the paintable foreground colors and the paintable background color into a single set called `paintable_colors`.\n5.  Locate all initial azure (8) pixels in the Canvas; these are the 'seeds' for the flood fill.\n6.  Initialize an output grid as a copy of the Canvas section.\n7.  Perform an 8-way connected flood fill starting from the seed pixels. The fill propagates from an azure pixel to an adjacent pixel only if the adjacent pixel's current color is present in the `paintable_colors` set.\n8.  Pixels that are filled change their color to azure (8). Pixels with colors not in `paintable_colors` act as barriers and stop the fill in that direction. Original azure seeds remain azure.\n9.  The final output is the modified Canvas grid after the flood fill is complete.\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef get_paintable_colors(palette, canvas):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies paintable foreground colors from the palette and the background color from the canvas.\n\n    Args:\n        palette (np.ndarray): The top section of the input grid (usually 6 rows).\n                                Can be empty if input grid is too small.\n        canvas (np.ndarray): The bottom section of the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        set: A set of integers representing the paintable colors (foreground + background).\n    \"\"\"\n    paintable_foreground = set()\n    \n    # --- Find Paintable Foreground Colors from Palette ---\n    if palette.size > 0 and palette.shape[0] > 2 and palette.shape[1] > 2:\n        palette_h, palette_w = palette.shape\n        # Iterate within the palette's assumed inner area (excluding 1-pixel border)\n        for r in range(1, palette_h - 1):\n            for c in range(1, palette_w - 1):\n                color = palette[r, c]\n                # Check if the color is a potential foreground color (not border 5, not background 0)\n                if color != 0 and color != 5:\n                    # Check 4-way neighbors for white (0)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                        # Ensure neighbor is within the palette bounds (including border for check)\n                        if 0 <= nr < palette_h and 0 <= nc < palette_w:\n                            if palette[nr, nc] == 0:\n                                paintable_foreground.add(color)\n                                break # Found a white neighbor, add color and move to next pixel in palette\n\n    # --- Find Paintable Background Color from Canvas ---\n    background_color = None\n    if canvas.size > 0:\n        canvas_colors, counts = np.unique(canvas, return_counts=True)\n        color_counts = Counter(dict(zip(canvas_colors, counts)))\n        \n        # Exclude azure (8) from background consideration\n        if 8 in color_counts:\n            del color_counts[8]\n            \n        # Find the most frequent remaining color\n        if color_counts:\n            # Ensure the result is a standard int type\n            background_color = int(color_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]) \n\n    # --- Combine Paintable Colors ---\n    paintable_colors = paintable_foreground\n    if background_color is not None:\n      paintable_colors.add(background_color)\n      \n    return paintable_colors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the flood fill transformation based on palette-defined foreground colors\n    and the canvas background color.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed output grid (canvas section only).\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=np.int64) # Use numpy for easier manipulation\n\n    # --- 1.
