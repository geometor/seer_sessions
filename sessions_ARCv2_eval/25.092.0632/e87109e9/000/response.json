            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid is consistently divided into two main sections:\n    *   **Top Section (Palette):** Rows 0-5. This section is framed by a gray (5) border. Inside, there are typically four small squares, each containing a unique color next to a white (0) area. The specific colors vary between examples (e.g., blue, magenta, yellow, red in train_1). This section appears to function as a key or legend.\n    *   **Bottom Section (Canvas):** The remaining rows below the top section. This area forms the main working space. It primarily consists of a single dominant background color (green in train_1, blue in train_2, orange in train_3) upon which various shapes or regions of other colors are placed. Notably, there is always at least one object colored azure (8).\n\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:**\n    *   The top \"Palette\" section is completely absent in the output.\n    *   The output grid consists only of the modified bottom \"Canvas\" section. The dimensions of the output correspond to the dimensions of the input's canvas section.\n    *   The background color of the canvas generally remains the same, except where modifications occur.\n\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The core transformation involves the azure (8) color. In the input, azure pixels form distinct, often small, objects.\n    *   In the output, the azure color spreads significantly from its original locations.\n    *   The spreading mechanism appears related to the colors defined in the input's top \"Palette\" section.\n    *   Specifically, the azure color seems to \"paint over\" or \"flood fill\" adjacent pixels (including diagonals) if those pixels belong to a set of \"paintable\" colors.\n    *   The \"paintable\" colors are determined by:\n        *   The colors explicitly paired with white (0) in the top \"Palette\" section.\n        *   The dominant background color of the bottom \"Canvas\" section.\n    *   Pixels with colors *not* defined as paintable (i.e., not in the palette next to white, and not the canvas background color) act as barriers and are not painted over by the azure flood fill, even if adjacent to azure pixels.\n    *   The original azure pixels remain azure in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"

Find all pixels that are *not* white (0) and *not* gray (5) but are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a white (0) pixel within the gray (5) border. Collect these colors into a set called `paintable_foreground_colors`.\n3.  **Identify Paintable Background Color:** Determine the most frequent color in the Canvas section. This is the `paintable_background_color`.\n4.  **Combine Paintable Colors:** Create a final set `paintable_colors` by taking the union of `paintable_foreground_colors` and the `paintable_background_color`.\n5.  **Locate Azure Seeds:** Find the coordinates of all pixels in the input Canvas that have the azure (8) color. Store these as the initial `fill_queue`.\n6.  **Initialize Output Canvas:** Create a copy of the input Canvas. This will be modified to become the output.\n7.  **Perform Flood Fill:**\n    *   While the `fill_queue` is not empty:\n        *   Remove a coordinate `(r, c)` from the `fill_queue`.\n        *   For each of the 8 neighbors `(nr, nc)` of `(r, c)` within the Canvas boundaries:\n            *   Check the color `neighbor_color` of the pixel at `(nr, nc)` in the *output* Canvas.\n            *   If `neighbor_color` is present in the `paintable_colors` set AND `neighbor_color` is *not* already azure (8):\n                *   Change the color of the pixel at `(nr, nc)` in the output Canvas to azure (8).\n                *   Add the coordinate `(nr, nc)` to the `fill_queue`.\n8.  **Final Output:** The modified output Canvas is the result of the transformation."
