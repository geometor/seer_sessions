grid_properties:
  - Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
colors:
  - Gray (8): Background color in the input. Some remain gray, others change.
  - Blue (1): 'Active' objects in the input. Remain unchanged in the output. Trigger color changes in adjacent gray pixels.
  - Magenta (6): A single 'marker' pixel in the input (bottom-left). Remains unchanged in the output. Does not directly trigger color changes.
  - Orange (7): A new color appearing only in the output. Replaces certain gray pixels.
objects:
  - Background: The set of gray (8) pixels.
  - Blue Pixels: Individual blue (1) pixels or contiguous groups of them.
  - Magenta Marker: The single magenta (6) pixel.
relationships:
  - Adjacency: The core relationship is the adjacency (including diagonals) between gray pixels and blue pixels.
transformation:
  - Rule: A gray pixel changes to orange if and only if it is adjacent (8 neighbors) to at least one blue pixel.
  - Preservation: Blue pixels and the magenta pixel retain their color and position. Gray pixels not adjacent to any blue pixel also retain their color and position.
