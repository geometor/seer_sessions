The input grids consist primarily of a gray (8) background, with scattered blue (1) pixels and a single magenta (6) pixel consistently located in the bottom-left corner.\n\nThe transformation rule centers on changing the color of specific gray pixels based on their proximity to blue pixels. The blue pixels themselves, as well as the magenta pixel, remain unchanged in the output grid. Gray pixels that are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to at least one blue pixel are changed to orange (7) in the output. All other gray pixels remain gray. The magenta pixel does not influence the color change of adjacent gray pixels unless those pixels are also adjacent to a blue pixel.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
