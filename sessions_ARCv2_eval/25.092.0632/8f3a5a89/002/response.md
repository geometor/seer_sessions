**Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core components (gray background, blue activators, magenta marker) and the basic transformation principle (gray changes to orange based on blue proximity). However, the implementation failed because the transformation is not limited to *direct* adjacency. The errors, particularly the large number of pixels that remained gray (8) in the `transformed_output` when they should have been orange (7) in the `expected_output`, strongly suggest a region-filling or flood-fill mechanism.

The strategy is to refine the understanding of how the orange (7) color propagates. The blue (1) pixels seem to initiate the change, but the effect spreads outwards through contiguous gray (8) pixels until it encounters boundaries. These boundaries appear to be the grid edges, other blue (1) pixels, and the magenta (6) pixel. Gray pixels adjacent only to the magenta pixel do not change unless they are also adjacent to a blue pixel or connected to one via a path of other gray pixels that will change.
