**General Assessment**

The initial transformation logic correctly identified the core trigger: gray pixels adjacent to blue pixels change color. However, the results show that this change isn't limited *only* to those directly adjacent pixels. In the expected outputs, the orange color (7) propagates outwards from the initially triggered gray pixels, filling entire contiguous regions of gray pixels that contain at least one pixel adjacent to a blue pixel. The previous code only changed the *directly* adjacent gray pixels, leading to significantly fewer orange pixels than expected.

The strategy to resolve this is to modify the transformation rule to incorporate a "flood fill" or "connected components" concept. We need to:
1. Identify all gray pixels directly adjacent (8-way) to any blue pixel.
2. Identify all contiguous regions (connected components) of gray pixels in the input.
3. If a gray region contains *any* of the pixels identified in step 1, then *all* pixels in that region should be changed to orange in the output.
4. Regions of gray pixels that have no adjacency to any blue pixel remain gray.
5. Non-gray pixels (blue and magenta) remain unchanged.

**Metrics Analysis**

Let's gather metrics to confirm the observations.
