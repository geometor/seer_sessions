Identify the background color (azure, 8) and boundary colors (any other color present in the input).\n2. Perform a flood fill (BFS) starting from all background pixels located on the grid's border.\n3. This flood fill only propagates through adjacent background pixels. Boundary pixels act as barriers.\n4. Keep track of all background pixels reached by this flood fill (the 'exterior' background pixels).\n5. Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n6. Iterate through the grid. Any pixel that was originally the background color but was *not* reached by the flood fill (i.e., it's an 'interior' background pixel enclosed by boundaries) is changed to the fill color (red, 2).\n7. All other pixels (boundary pixels and exterior background pixels) retain their original color.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by flood-filling the exterior background area and\n    then changing the color of the interior (unfilled) background pixels.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid represented as a 2D list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = grid.copy()\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    \n    # Define colors based on the analysis (background is azure 8, fill is red 2)\n    background_color = 8\n    fill_color = 2\n\n    # Keep track of visited background cells reachable from the exterior\n    # Initialize a boolean mask of the same shape as the grid, default to False\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    # Initialize a queue for the Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Seed the BFS queue with all background cells on the border\n    for r in range(height):\n        # Check left border\n        if grid[r, 0] == background_color and not visited[r, 0]:\n            queue.append((r, 0))\n            visited[r, 0] = True\n        # Check right border\n        if grid[r, width - 1] == background_color and not visited[r, width - 1]:\n            queue.append((r, width - 1))\n            visited[r, width - 1] = True\n            \n    for c in range(width): # Range already covers corners checked above, but adds interior border cells\n        # Check top border\n        if grid[0, c] == background_color and not visited[0, c]:\n            queue.append((0, c))\n            visited[0, c] = True\n        # Check bottom border\n        if grid[height - 1, c] == background_color and not visited[height - 1, c]:\n            queue.append((height - 1, c))\n            visited[height - 1, c] = True\n\n    # Perform the flood fill (BFS) from the border background cells\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Check neighbors (up, down, left, right)\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n\n            # Check if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries\n            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                # Check if the neighbor is a background cell in the original grid\n                # AND if it hasn't been visited yet by the flood fill\n                if grid[nr, nc] == background_color and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                    # Mark the neighbor as visited\n                    visited[nr, nc] = True\n                    # Add the neighbor to the queue to explore from it later\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    # Iterate through the entire grid to determine the final output colors\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # If a cell is background color in the original grid \n            # AND it was *not* visited by the flood fill (meaning it's enclosed)\n            if grid[r, c] == background_color and not visited[r, c]:\n                # Change its color to the fill color in the output grid\n                output_grid[r, c] = fill_color\n            # Otherwise, the output_grid pixel retains its original color (from the initial copy)\n\n    # Convert the final numpy array back to a list of lists\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
