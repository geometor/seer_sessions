task_elements:
  - item: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: 'azure' (8)
      - contains: 'boundary' pixels
  - item: boundary_pixels
    properties:
      - color: Varies per example ('yellow' (4) or 'green' (3)), but is consistent within one example.
      - distribution: Scattered, acting as single-pixel objects.
      - role: Define the limits of regions to be filled.
  - item: output_grid
    properties:
      - size: Same as input grid.
      - background_color: 'azure' (8) (in areas outside the filled regions)
      - boundary_pixels: Unchanged from input.
      - filled_pixels:
          - color: 'red' (2)
          - location: Occupy the positions of original 'azure' background pixels that were enclosed by 'boundary' pixels.
actions:
  - action: identify_colors
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: background_color, boundary_color
  - action: identify_regions
    inputs: input_grid, background_color, boundary_color
    description: Determine which background pixels are 'inside' the boundary defined by boundary_pixels.
    method: Flood fill from an exterior point. Pixels not reached by the fill are considered 'inside'.
  - action: fill_regions
    inputs: input_grid, identified_interior_pixels
    output: output_grid
    description: Change the color of identified interior background pixels to 'red' (2). Keep all other pixels as they were in the input.
relationships:
  - type: enclosure
    subject: boundary_pixels
    object: background_pixels ('azure')
    description: The boundary pixels collectively enclose certain regions of background pixels.
  - type: transformation
    subject: enclosed_background_pixels
    target: filled_pixels ('red')
    description: Enclosed background pixels are transformed into filled pixels.
