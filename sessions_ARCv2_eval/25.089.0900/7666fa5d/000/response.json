Let's call this the 'boundary' color.\n    *   The output grid introduces 'red' (2) pixels.\n3.  **Constancy:** The background color pixels ('azure') far from the 'boundary' color pixels remain 'azure'. The 'boundary' color pixels ('yellow' or 'green') remain in their original positions in the output.\n4.  **Transformation:** The change occurs in the 'azure' background pixels located *between* or *enclosed by* the 'boundary' color pixels. These 'azure' pixels are changed to 'red' (2).\n5.  **Shape/Region:** The 'red' pixels form contiguous regions. These regions appear to be the areas of the background ('azure') that are \"inside\" the shapes or outlines formed by the 'boundary' ('yellow'/'green') pixels.\n6.  **Mechanism:** This strongly suggests a region-filling process. The 'boundary' pixels act as barriers. The 'azure' pixels that are not reachable from the outer edges of the grid without crossing a 'boundary' pixel are filled with 'red'. This is characteristic of a flood fill algorithm applied inversely: identify the exterior, and everything else that was originally background becomes the filled region.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify the background color (which is 'azure', 8) and the single non-background color (the 'boundary' color, e.g., 'yellow' 4 or 'green' 3).\n3.  Select a starting pixel for a flood fill, ensuring it's a background pixel located on the exterior of any shapes formed by the boundary pixels (e.g., a corner pixel like (0,0) if it's the background color).\n4.  Perform a flood fill starting from that exterior point:\n    *   Mark the starting pixel and add it to a queue.\n    *   Use a temporary marker color (e.g., a color not present in input or output like 9) to track visited exterior background pixels. Change the starting pixel in the working grid to this temporary color.\n    *   While the queue is not empty:\n        *   Dequeue a pixel.\n        *   For each of its neighbors (up, down, left, right):\n            *   If the neighbor is within the grid boundaries AND its color in the working grid is the original background color ('azure'):\n                *   Change the neighbor's color in the working grid to the temporary marker color.\n                *   Enqueue the neighbor.\n5.  After the flood fill completes, iterate through every pixel in the working grid:\n    *   If a pixel's color is the original background color ('azure'), change it to 'red' (2). This identifies the interior pixels that were not reached by the flood fill.\n    *   If a pixel's color is the temporary marker color, change it back to the original background color ('azure'). This restores the exterior background pixels.\n    *   Leave pixels with the 'boundary' color unchanged.\n6.  The final working grid is the result."
