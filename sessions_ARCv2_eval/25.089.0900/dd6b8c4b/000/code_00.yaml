elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      size: 11x11 (constant in examples)
      background_color: orange (7)

  - object: core_object
    description: A structure composed of green and red pixels.
    properties:
      - color_composition: [green (3), red (2)]
      - structure: In examples, a 3x3 square with a central red pixel.
      - connectivity: The green and red pixels form a single connected component.
      - unique_red_pixel: Contains exactly one red (2) pixel.
    location: Centered variably within the grid.

  - object: border
    description: Pixels immediately adjacent to the core_object (excluding pixels within the core_object).
    properties:
      - color: Can be uniformly magenta (6) or orange (7) in examples.
      - relationship: Adjacent to the green pixels of the core_object.

  - object: maroon_pixels
    description: Scattered individual or groups of maroon (9) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: maroon (9)
      - location: Variable throughout the grid.
      - relationship: Can be adjacent to the 'border' object (specifically when the border is magenta).

actions:
  - identify: Locate the unique red (2) pixel.
  - identify: Locate the connected green (3) pixels associated with the red pixel (the core_object).
  - determine: Find the pixels forming the border around the core_object.
  - check_property: Determine the color(s) of the border pixels.
  - check_adjacency: Determine if any maroon (9) pixels are adjacent to magenta (6) border pixels.
  - transform: Change the color of specific green (3) pixels within the core_object to maroon (9) based on conditions.

conditions_and_rules:
  - condition: Check if all border pixels are magenta (6).
    - if_true:
      - condition: Check if any maroon (9) pixel is adjacent to any magenta (6) border pixel.
        - if_true: Apply Rule B (change all green pixels in core_object to maroon).
        - if_false: Apply Rule A (change green pixels above or left-of-same-row relative to the red pixel to maroon).
    - if_false: (e.g., border is orange)
      - Apply Rule A (change green pixels above or left-of-same-row relative to the red pixel to maroon).
