task_elements:
  - Input Grid: A 2D array of colored pixels.
  - Output Grid: A 2D array of colored pixels, derived from the input.
  - Background Color: The most frequent color in the input grid.
  - Delimiter Line:
    - A vertical line (column) in the input grid.
    - Spans the entire height of the grid.
    - Composed of a single color that is *different* from the background color.
    - Multiple delimiter lines might exist, but only the leftmost one is relevant.
  - Target Subgrid: The rectangular portion of the input grid located from the leftmost column up to (but not including) the column of the first delimiter line.

transformation:
  - action: Identify the background color of the input grid (most frequent color).
  - action: Scan the columns of the input grid from left to right (index 0 upwards).
  - action: Find the first column that meets the criteria for a 'Delimiter Line'.
  - action: Extract the 'Target Subgrid' based on the identified delimiter column index.
  - result: The extracted 'Target Subgrid' is the output grid.

relationships:
  - The output grid's height is identical to the input grid's height.
  - The output grid's width is determined by the column index of the first vertical delimiter line found in the input.
  - The delimiter line itself is excluded from the output grid.
  - The colors and relative positions of pixels within the target subgrid are preserved in the output grid.
