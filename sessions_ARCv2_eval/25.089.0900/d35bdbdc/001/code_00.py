"""
Transforms the input grid based on identifying specific 3x3 patterns.

The core logic identifies 3x3 patterns where a central pixel (color C, C!=0) 
is surrounded by 8 frame pixels of a single, uniform color F (F!=0, F!=C).

Based on the specific pair (C, F), one of two actions is taken:
1. Removal: The entire 3x3 pattern area is replaced with white (0) pixels.
2. Center Color Change: Only the center pixel's color is changed to a new color N.

Pixels not part of such identified and modified patterns remain unchanged. 
Removal takes precedence if a pixel is marked for both change and removal.
