The input grids contain a background color (azure, 8), a single horizontal line composed of magenta (6) pixels, and various other colored pixels (objects) primarily located above the magenta line. The transformation moves these objects downwards within their respective columns until they either rest on the magenta line or land on top of another object that has already settled in that column. Objects maintain their original colors and horizontal positions. Pixels below the magenta line, the magenta line itself, and the background pixels that are not replaced by falling objects remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Iterate through each column of the grid.\n5.  For the current column, identify all falling objects (non-azure, non-magenta pixels above the magenta floor line).\n6.  If falling objects exist in the column:\n    a.  Temporarily remove all falling objects from this column in the output grid, replacing them with the background color (azure, 8).\n    b.  For each falling object identified in step 5 (processing them from lowest original row to highest original row is simplest), determine its 'landing spot' in the output grid's column. The landing spot is the highest row index `r` such that `grid[r][col]` is azure (8) and `grid[r+1][col]` is either magenta (6) or another non-azure object.\n    c.  Place the falling object's color into the determined landing spot `(r, col)` in the output grid.\n7.  After processing all columns, the modified output grid represents the final state."
