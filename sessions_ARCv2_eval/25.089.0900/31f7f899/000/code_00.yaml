Grid:
  Background: Azure (8) is the predominant color.
  Reference Line:
    Exists: True
    Color: Magenta (6)
    Orientation: Horizontal
    Uniqueness: Single instance per grid.
    Behavior: Static, acts as a barrier or floor.
Objects:
  Identification: Contiguous pixels or single pixels of any color other than Azure (8) and Magenta (6).
  Location: Primarily located above the Magenta reference line in the input.
  Behavior:
    Action: Move vertically downwards ("fall").
    Constraint: Movement stops when the object is directly above a Magenta pixel or another non-Azure pixel in the same column.
    Integrity: Objects retain their shape and color during movement.
    Relativity: Objects maintain their horizontal position (column).
Transformation:
  Focus: Applies only to objects located above the Magenta line.
  Mechanism: Simulates gravity within each column independently.
  Outcome: Objects settle at the lowest possible position within their column, bounded below by the Magenta line or previously settled objects.
  Scope: Pixels at or below the Magenta line are unaffected.
