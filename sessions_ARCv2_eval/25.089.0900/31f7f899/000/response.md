**Perception**

The task involves simulating a form of gravity constrained by a specific horizontal line within the grid. The input grids contain a background color (azure, 8), a single horizontal line composed of magenta (6) pixels, and various other colored pixels (objects) primarily located above the magenta line. The transformation moves these objects downwards within their respective columns until they either rest on the magenta line or land on top of another object that has already settled in that column. Objects maintain their original colors and horizontal positions. Pixels below the magenta line, the magenta line itself, and the background pixels that are not replaced by falling objects remain unchanged.

**Facts**


```yaml
Grid:
  Background: Azure (8) is the predominant color.
  Reference Line:
    Exists: True
    Color: Magenta (6)
    Orientation: Horizontal
    Uniqueness: Single instance per grid.
    Behavior: Static, acts as a barrier or floor.
Objects:
  Identification: Contiguous pixels or single pixels of any color other than Azure (8) and Magenta (6).
  Location: Primarily located above the Magenta reference line in the input.
  Behavior:
    Action: Move vertically downwards ("fall").
    Constraint: Movement stops when the object is directly above a Magenta pixel or another non-Azure pixel in the same column.
    Integrity: Objects retain their shape and color during movement.
    Relativity: Objects maintain their horizontal position (column).
Transformation:
  Focus: Applies only to objects located above the Magenta line.
  Mechanism: Simulates gravity within each column independently.
  Outcome: Objects settle at the lowest possible position within their column, bounded below by the Magenta line or previously settled objects.
  Scope: Pixels at or below the Magenta line are unaffected.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the horizontal row composed entirely of magenta (6) pixels. This is the 'floor'.
2.  Identify all non-azure (8) and non-magenta (6) pixels located *above* the magenta floor line. These are the 'falling objects'.
3.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
4.  Iterate through each column of the grid.
5.  For the current column, identify all falling objects (non-azure, non-magenta pixels above the magenta floor line).
6.  If falling objects exist in the column:
    a.  Temporarily remove all falling objects from this column in the output grid, replacing them with the background color (azure, 8).
    b.  For each falling object identified in step 5 (processing them from lowest original row to highest original row is simplest), determine its 'landing spot' in the output grid's column. The landing spot is the highest row index `r` such that `grid[r][col]` is azure (8) and `grid[r+1][col]` is either magenta (6) or another non-azure object.
    c.  Place the falling object's color into the determined landing spot `(r, col)` in the output grid.
7.  After processing all columns, the modified output grid represents the final state.
