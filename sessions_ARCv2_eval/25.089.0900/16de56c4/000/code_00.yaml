task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  cell_values: integers 0-9 (colors)
  background_color: 0 (white)
  size_variable: true

input_features:
  - objects: individual non-white pixels
  - objects: horizontal pairs/segments of identical non-white pixels
  - property: position (row, column) of pixels
  - property: color of pixels
  - critical_feature: content and structure of the last row (presence/absence of adjacent identical non-white pixels)
  - critical_feature: position and color of all non-white pixels in the last row (for vertical mode)
  - critical_feature: position and color of leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels within each row (for horizontal mode)
  - critical_feature: set of unique colors within each row (for horizontal mode)
  - critical_feature: maximum column index containing any non-white pixel across the entire grid (for horizontal mode)

output_features:
  - transformation_mode_1: horizontal line filling/extension
    - based_on: pixels within each row, grid maximum column index
    - color_rule: depends on unique colors in the row (color of rightmost pixel)
    - extent_rule: depends on unique colors in the row (min/max columns in row or grid max column)
  - transformation_mode_2: vertical line drawing
    - based_on: pixels in the last row of the input
    - color_rule: color of the corresponding last-row pixel
    - extent_rule: full height of the grid at the column of the corresponding last-row pixel
  - preservation: original input pixels are generally preserved in the output, overlaid by new lines.

relationships:
  - conditional_logic: the transformation rule depends on the structure of the last row of the input grid.
  - pattern_mapping: specific patterns in rows (horizontal) or the last row (vertical) map to specific output structures (lines).

anomaly:
  - example: train_1, row 1
  - description: the transformation adds a single pixel (1,6,blue) which does not align perfectly with the generalized horizontal filling rule derived from other rows in the same example.
