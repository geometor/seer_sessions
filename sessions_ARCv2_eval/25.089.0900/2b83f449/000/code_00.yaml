elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - contains pixels of various colors (0-White, 3-Green, 7-Orange, 8-Gray initially)
      - dimensions vary between examples
      - exhibits alternating row patterns in some cases
  - object: color_block
    properties:
      - type: horizontal segment
      - color: Orange (7)
      - shape: 1x3 rectangle (7 7 7)
      - location: found within rows primarily containing White (0)
actions:
  - name: locate
    input: Orange (7) horizontal 1x3 blocks
    target: grid
  - name: transform_block
    input_object: Orange (7) 1x3 block at (r, c), (r, c+1), (r, c+2)
    output_pattern:
      - cell (r, c) becomes Gray (8)
      - cell (r, c+1) becomes Magenta (6)
      - cell (r, c+2) becomes Gray (8)
  - name: modify_above
    condition: pixel at (r-1, c+1) exists and is Gray (8) in the input
    input_object: middle pixel (r, c+1) of an original Orange (7) 1x3 block
    target_cell: pixel at (r-1, c+1)
    output_color: Magenta (6)
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The transformation affects the pixel directly above the central pixel of the Orange (7) block.
  - type: replacement
    description: Orange (7) pixels are replaced by Gray (8) and Magenta (6). Some Gray (8) pixels are replaced by Magenta (6).
  - type: identity
    description: Pixels not part of the Orange blocks or directly above their centers (if Gray) remain unchanged.
