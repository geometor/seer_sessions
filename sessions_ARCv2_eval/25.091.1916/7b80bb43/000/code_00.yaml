task_context:
  grid_size_relationship: input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  colors_present: two distinct colors per example pair.
  background_color: the most frequent color in the input grid (blue=1 or white=0).
  foreground_color: the less frequent color in the input grid (magenta=6 or green=3).

objects:
  - type: background_pixels
    properties:
      color: varies (blue=1 or white=0)
      role: constitutes the main area of the grid.
  - type: foreground_pixels
    properties:
      color: varies (magenta=6 or green=3)
      role: forms patterns or shapes, acts as boundaries for filling.
  - type: horizontal_gap
    properties:
      color: background_color
      location: exists within a single row.
      definition: a contiguous sequence of one or more background pixels.
      boundary_condition: must be immediately adjacent (left and right) to foreground pixels within the same row.

actions:
  - name: identify_colors
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: background_color, foreground_color
    description: Determine the most frequent (background) and the other (foreground) color.
  - name: scan_rows
    inputs: input_grid, background_color, foreground_color
    outputs: modified_grid
    description: Process each row independently.
  - name: find_horizontal_gaps
    inputs: row, background_color, foreground_color
    outputs: list_of_gap_indices
    description: Identify sequences of background pixels bounded horizontally by foreground pixels within the row.
  - name: fill_gaps
    inputs: row, list_of_gap_indices, foreground_color
    outputs: modified_row
    description: Change the color of pixels within identified gaps to the foreground color.

relationships:
  - type: horizontal_adjacency
    description: The core logic relies on checking pixels immediately to the left and right of a sequence within the same row.
  - type: color_filling
    description: Identified horizontal gaps (background color) are filled with the foreground color.
  - type: conservation
    description: Pixels not involved in a fillable gap retain their original color. Grid dimensions are conserved.
