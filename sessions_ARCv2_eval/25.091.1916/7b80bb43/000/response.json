Determine the background color (the color that appears most frequently in the input grid) and the foreground color (the other color present).\n3.  Iterate through each row of the grid copy, from top to bottom.\n4.  For the current row, iterate through the pixels from left to right (e.g., index `c` from 1 to width-2).\n5.  At each position `(r, c)`, check if the pixel color is the background color *and* if the pixel immediately to its left `(r, c-1)` and the pixel immediately to its right `(r, c+1)` are *both* the foreground color.\n6.  If this condition is met, change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the grid copy to the foreground color.\n7.  Continue this process. Note: This simple check only fills gaps of size 1. A more robust approach is needed for larger gaps.\n8.  **Revised Row Processing:** Iterate through each row `r`. Find all column indices `c` where `grid[r][c]` is the foreground color.\n9.  For each pair of consecutive foreground column indices `c1` and `c2` in that row (where `c2 > c1 + 1`), check if all pixels `grid[r][k]` for `c1 < k < c2` are the background color.\n10. If all pixels between `c1` and `c2` are the background color, change the color of these pixels (`grid_copy[r][k]` for `c1 < k < c2`) to the foreground color.\n11. After processing all rows, the modified grid copy is the final output grid."
