task_description: "Modify colors of plus-shaped objects based on the color of specific horizontal lines directly below them on the bottom row, then remove the lines."

grid_properties:
  - background_color: Determined by the color of the pixel at (0,0). Remains constant in output except where lines are removed.
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.

objects:
  - type: plus_shape
    description: "A 5x5 cross shape made of a single color."
    properties:
      - color: Various (Maroon, White, Blue, Yellow, Azure, Magenta, Green, Red, Orange)
      - position: Various locations within the grid.
    actions:
      - color_change: May change color to Gray (5) based on the trigger_line below.
      - remain_unchanged: If not above a trigger_line, or if above a Green trigger_line.
  - type: trigger_line
    description: "A 1x5 horizontal rectangle located on the bottom row (row H-1)."
    properties:
      - color: Exclusively Red (2) or Green (3).
      - position: Always on the bottom row, column varies.
    actions:
      - cause_effect: Triggers potential color change in the plus_shape object directly above it.
      - removed: Always removed from the output grid (pixels replaced by background_color).

relationships:
  - relationship: "directly_above"
    object1: plus_shape
    object2: trigger_line
    condition: "The column range of the plus_shape significantly overlaps with the column range of the trigger_line on the row below (H-1)."

transformation_rules:
  - rule: "Red Trigger"
    condition: "A plus_shape is directly_above a Red (2) trigger_line."
    action: "Change the color of the plus_shape to Gray (5)."
  - rule: "Green Trigger"
    condition: "A plus_shape is directly_above a Green (3) trigger_line."
    action: "The color of the plus_shape remains unchanged."
  - rule: "Line Removal"
    condition: "An object is a trigger_line (Red or Green on the bottom row)."
    action: "Remove the trigger_line by replacing its pixels with the background_color."
  - rule: "Default Preservation"
    condition: "Any pixel not part of a trigger_line or a plus_shape modified by a Red trigger_line."
    action: "Keep the pixel's original color."
