Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with varying dimensions (all examples here are 30x30).
2.  **Background Color:** Each grid has a dominant background color filling most of the space (Orange=7 in train_1, Blue=1 in train_2, Magenta=6 in train_3). This color seems consistent between the input and output, except where objects are modified. The background color appears to be the color of the top-left pixel (0,0).
3.  **Objects:** The input grids contain distinct objects placed on the background. These objects appear in two main shapes:
    *   **Plus Shape:** A cross shape, typically 5 pixels tall and 5 pixels wide (e.g., a 3x5 horizontal bar intersecting a 5x3 vertical bar at the center seems incorrect based on the visual, it's more like a 1x5 horizontal bar intersecting a 3x1 vertical bar or vice versa, specifically a 3-pixel vertical line and a 5-pixel horizontal line crossing at their centers). These plus shapes appear in various colors (Maroon, White, Blue, Yellow, Azure, Magenta, Green, Red, Orange).
    *   **Horizontal Line:** A 1x5 rectangle (line segment) located specifically on the bottom row of the grid (row index H-1). These lines only appear in Red (2) or Green (3).
4.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation involves:
    *   Identifying the Red (2) and Green (3) horizontal lines on the bottom row.
    *   Locating the plus-shaped object(s) positioned directly above these lines (sharing the same column range).
    *   Conditionally changing the color of the plus-shaped object based on the color of the line below it.
    *   Removing the Red and Green lines from the bottom row.
5.  **Color Changes:**
    *   If a plus-shaped object is above a *Red (2)* line, its color changes to *Gray (5)*. (Observed for Maroon(9), Magenta(6), Green(3)).
    *   If a plus-shaped object is above a *Green (3)* line, its color *does not change*. (Observed for Blue(1), White(0), Red(2)).
6.  **Object Removal:** The Red (2) and Green (3) horizontal lines on the bottom row are always removed (replaced by the background color) in the output.
7.  **Object Preservation:** All other plus-shaped objects not located directly above a Red or Green line on the bottom row remain unchanged in position and color. The background color also remains the same.

**YAML Fact Sheet**


```yaml
task_description: "Modify colors of plus-shaped objects based on the color of specific horizontal lines directly below them on the bottom row, then remove the lines."

grid_properties:
  - background_color: Determined by the color of the pixel at (0,0). Remains constant in output except where lines are removed.
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.

objects:
  - type: plus_shape
    description: "A 5x5 cross shape made of a single color."
    properties:
      - color: Various (Maroon, White, Blue, Yellow, Azure, Magenta, Green, Red, Orange)
      - position: Various locations within the grid.
    actions:
      - color_change: May change color to Gray (5) based on the trigger_line below.
      - remain_unchanged: If not above a trigger_line, or if above a Green trigger_line.
  - type: trigger_line
    description: "A 1x5 horizontal rectangle located on the bottom row (row H-1)."
    properties:
      - color: Exclusively Red (2) or Green (3).
      - position: Always on the bottom row, column varies.
    actions:
      - cause_effect: Triggers potential color change in the plus_shape object directly above it.
      - removed: Always removed from the output grid (pixels replaced by background_color).

relationships:
  - relationship: "directly_above"
    object1: plus_shape
    object2: trigger_line
    condition: "The column range of the plus_shape significantly overlaps with the column range of the trigger_line on the row below (H-1)."

transformation_rules:
  - rule: "Red Trigger"
    condition: "A plus_shape is directly_above a Red (2) trigger_line."
    action: "Change the color of the plus_shape to Gray (5)."
  - rule: "Green Trigger"
    condition: "A plus_shape is directly_above a Green (3) trigger_line."
    action: "The color of the plus_shape remains unchanged."
  - rule: "Line Removal"
    condition: "An object is a trigger_line (Red or Green on the bottom row)."
    action: "Remove the trigger_line by replacing its pixels with the background_color."
  - rule: "Default Preservation"
    condition: "Any pixel not part of a trigger_line or a plus_shape modified by a Red trigger_line."
    action: "Keep the pixel's original color."

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Determine the background color by inspecting the color of the pixel at coordinates (0, 0) in the input grid.
3.  Identify all horizontal, 5-pixel-long line segments composed solely of Red (2) or Green (3) pixels located on the bottom row (row index H-1, where H is the grid height) of the input grid. Let's call these "trigger lines".
4.  For each identified trigger line:
    a.  Determine its color (Red or Green) and its column range.
    b.  Scan the input grid to find any plus-shaped objects positioned directly above the trigger line (i.e., the object's columns overlap with the trigger line's columns, and the object is vertically adjacent or close).
    c.  If the trigger line's color is Red (2):
        i.  For each plus-shaped object found directly above it, change all pixels belonging to that object in the *output* grid to Gray (5).
    d.  If the trigger line's color is Green (3):
        i.  The plus-shaped object(s) directly above it remain unchanged in the output grid (no action needed due to step 1).
    e.  Change the pixels corresponding to the trigger line itself (on the bottom row in the identified column range) in the *output* grid to the background color determined in step 2.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
