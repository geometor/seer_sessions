            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with varying dimensions (all examples here are 30x30).\n2.  **Background Color:** Each grid has a dominant background color filling most of the space (Orange=7 in train_1, Blue=1 in train_2, Magenta=6 in train_3). This color seems consistent between the input and output, except where objects are modified. The background color appears to be the color of the top-left pixel (0,0).\n3.  **Objects:** The input grids contain distinct objects placed on the background. These objects appear in two main shapes:\n    *   **Plus Shape:** A cross shape, typically 5 pixels tall and 5 pixels wide (e.g., a 3x5 horizontal bar intersecting a 5x3 vertical bar at the center seems incorrect based on the visual, it's more like a 1x5 horizontal bar intersecting a 3x1 vertical bar or vice versa, specifically a 3-pixel vertical line and a 5-pixel horizontal line crossing at their centers). These plus shapes appear in various colors (Maroon, White, Blue, Yellow, Azure, Magenta, Green, Red, Orange).\n    *   **Horizontal Line:** A 1x5 rectangle (line segment) located specifically on the bottom row of the grid (row index H-1). These lines only appear in Red (2) or Green (3).\n4.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation involves:\n    *   Identifying the Red (2) and Green (3) horizontal lines on the bottom row.\n    *   Locating the plus-shaped object(s) positioned directly above these lines (sharing the same column range).\n    *   Conditionally changing the color of the plus-shaped object based on the color of the line below it.\n    *   Removing the Red and Green lines from the bottom row.\n5.  **Color Changes:**\n    *   If a plus-shaped object is above a *Red (2)* line, its color changes to *Gray (5)*. (Observed for Maroon(9), Magenta(6), Green(3)).\n    *   If a plus-shaped object is above a *Green (3)* line, its color *does not change*. (Observed for Blue(1), White(0), Red(2)).\n6.  **Object Removal:** The Red (2) and Green (3) horizontal lines on the bottom row are always removed (replaced by the background color) in the output.\n7.  **Object Preservation:** All other plus-shaped objects not located directly above a Red or Green line on the bottom row remain unchanged in position and color. The background color also remains the same.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet**\n\n"
