task_description: "Modify the color of specific 3x5 cross shapes to gray if they are positioned directly above a red 1x5 line on the bottom row. Remove all red and green 1x5 lines from the bottom row."

grid_properties:
  - background_color: Determined by the color of the pixel at (0,0). Replaces removed trigger lines.
  - dimensions: Input and output grids share the same dimensions (all examples 30x30).

objects:
  - type: cross_shape
    description: "A shape composed of a 1x5 horizontal bar and a 3x1 vertical bar intersecting at their centers. Total 9 pixels, size 3 rows x 5 columns."
    properties:
      - color: Various (non-background colors observed: Maroon, White, Blue, Yellow, Azure, Magenta, Red, Green, Orange).
      - position: Various locations. Relevant ones are positioned with rows H-4 to H-2 for a grid of height H.
      - width: 5 pixels.
      - height: 3 pixels.
    actions:
      - color_change: Changes color to Gray (5) if directly above a red_trigger_line.
      - remain_unchanged: If directly above a green_trigger_line or no trigger_line.
  - type: trigger_line
    description: "A 1x5 horizontal rectangle located exactly on the bottom row (row H-1)."
    properties:
      - color: Exclusively Red (2) or Green (3).
      - position: Row H-1, columns c to c+4.
      - width: 5 pixels.
      - height: 1 pixel.
    actions:
      - cause_effect: If Red, triggers color change in the cross_shape directly above it. If Green, causes no change.
      - removed: Always removed from the output grid (replaced by background_color).

relationships:
  - relationship: "directly_above"
    object1: cross_shape
    object2: trigger_line
    condition: "The trigger_line occupies row H-1, columns c to c+4. The cross_shape occupies rows H-4 to H-2 and columns c to c+4 (exact column match)."

transformation_rules:
  - rule: "Red Trigger Activation"
    condition: "A cross_shape is directly_above a Red (2) trigger_line."
    action: "Change all 9 pixels of the cross_shape in the output grid to Gray (5)."
  - rule: "Green Trigger Inactivation"
    condition: "A cross_shape is directly_above a Green (3) trigger_line."
    action: "The cross_shape remains unchanged in the output grid."
  - rule: "Line Removal"
    condition: "A 1x5 line segment on the bottom row (H-1) consists entirely of Red (2) or Green (3) pixels."
    action: "Replace these 5 pixels in the output grid with the background_color."
  - rule: "Default Preservation"
    condition: "Any pixel not part of a removed trigger_line or a cross_shape modified by a Red trigger."
    action: "Keep the pixel's original color (achieved by initializing output as a copy of input)."
