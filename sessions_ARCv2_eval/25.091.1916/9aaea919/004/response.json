            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial code attempt failed due to a timeout, likely caused by an incorrect understanding of the spatial relationship between the \"trigger lines\" and the \"cross shapes\". The assumption was that the cross shapes were *directly* above the lines, leading to checks in the wrong locations. Re-analysis of all three training examples reveals that the critical factor is the *column overlap* between the trigger lines (1x5 Red or Green lines on the bottom row) and the cross shapes (3x5 shapes anywhere in the grid), irrespective of the vertical distance.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution**\n\n1.  **Identify Trigger Lines:** Scan only the bottom row (H-1) for contiguous 1x5 segments of Red (2) or Green (3) pixels. Store the color and column range `(start_col, end_col)` for each found line.\n2.  **Identify Cross Shapes:** Scan the entire grid to locate all 3x5 cross shapes (a 1x5 horizontal bar intersecting a 3x1 vertical bar at their centers). Ensure these shapes are isolated (surrounding relevant pixels match the background color). Store the coordinates of the pixels belonging to each cross, its original color, and its column range `(start_col, end_col)`.\n3.  **Apply Transformation Logic:**\n    *   Create a copy of the input grid for the output.\n    *   Iterate through each identified cross shape.\n    *   Check if its column range overlaps with the column range of any identified Red trigger line. Overlap occurs if `max(cross_start_col, line_start_col) <= min(cross_end_col, line_end_col)`.\n    *   If an overlap with a Red line exists, change the color of all pixels belonging to that cross shape in the *output* grid to Gray (5).\n    *   If no overlap with a Red line exists, check for overlap with any Green trigger line using the same logic. If overlap exists, the cross shape remains unchanged (no action needed on the output grid copy).\n    *   If a cross overlaps with neither, it also remains unchanged.\n4.  **Remove Trigger Lines:** Iterate through the stored Red and Green trigger lines. For each line, change the corresponding pixels on the bottom row of the *output* grid to the background color.\n5.  Return the modified output grid.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
