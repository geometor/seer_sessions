Modifies the area to the left of the line: replaces white (0) pixels with magenta (6).\n3. Analyzes connected white (0) shapes in the original input's left area.\n4. Modifies the area to the right of the line based on the white shapes found on the left:\n   - If any white shape intersecting a given row contains a vertical segment of 2 or more pixels,\n     that row's right section in the output is filled with red (2).\n   - Otherwise (if the row has no white pixels, or only white shapes without vertical segments),\n     a portion of the input grid's left side (starting from the second column, index 1) is copied\n     to the output grid's right side. The width of the copied portion equals the width\n     of the right side section, or the available width on the left side starting from column 1,\n     whichever is smaller.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Helper function to find connected components (shapes) of a specific color\ndef find_shapes(grid_section, target_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds connected components (shapes) of target_color using BFS.\n    Detects connectivity based on the 8 neighboring cells (Moore neighborhood).\n\n    Args:\n        grid_section: A 2D numpy array representing the area to search.\n        target_color: The color value (int) to find shapes of.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a shape\n        and contains:\n        'coords': A set of (row, col) tuples relative to grid_section.\n        'rows': A set of unique row indices (relative to grid_section)\n                spanned by the shape.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid_section.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid_section, dtype=bool)\n    shapes = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Start BFS if we find a target pixel that hasn't been visited\n            if grid_section[r, c] == target_color and not visited[r, c]:\n                shape_coords = set()\n                shape_rows = set()\n                q = [(r, c)] # Queue for BFS\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                \n                while q:\n                    curr_r, curr_c = q.pop(0)\n                    shape_coords.add((curr_r, curr_c))\n                    shape_rows.add(curr_r)\n                    \n                    # Check 8 neighbors (Moore neighborhood)\n                    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                                continue # Skip self\n                            nr, nc = curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc\n                            \n                            # Check neighbor validity (bounds, color, visited status)\n                            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                               grid_section[nr, nc] == target_color and \\\n                               not visited[nr, nc]:\n                                visited[nr, nc] = True\n                                q.append((nr, nc))\n                                \n                # Add the found shape to the list if it's not empty\n                if shape_coords:\n                    shapes.append({'coords': shape_coords, 'rows': shape_rows})\n    return shapes\n\n# Helper function to check for vertical segment of length >= 2 within a shape\ndef has_vertical_segment(shape_coords):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a shape contains a vertical segment of 2 or more pixels.\n    A vertical segment means a pixel at (r, c) and another at (r+1, c)\n    are both part of the shape.\n\n    Args:\n        shape_coords: A set of (row, col) tuples representing the shape's coordinates.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if a vertical segment of length 2 or more exists, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    for r, c in shape_coords:\n        # Check if the pixel directly below is also part of the shape\n        if (r + 1, c) in shape_coords:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation logic to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    # Create a copy to modify for the output\n    output_grid = input_grid_np.copy()\n    rows, cols = input_grid_np.shape\n\n    # --- Step 1: Find the vertical gray (5) separator line ---\n    gray_col_index = -1\n    for c in range(cols):\n        # Check if the entire column consists of the"
