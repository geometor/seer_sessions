"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
1. Identifies a vertical gray (5) separator line.
2. Modifies the area to the left of the line: replaces white (0) pixels with magenta (6).
3. Analyzes connected white (0) shapes in the original input's left area.
4. Modifies the area to the right of the line based on the white shapes found on the left:
   - If any white shape intersecting a given row contains a vertical segment of 2 or more pixels,
     that row's right section in the output is filled with red (2).
   - Otherwise (if the row has no white pixels, or only white shapes without vertical segments),
     a portion of the input grid's left side (starting from the second column, index 1) is copied
     to the output grid's right side. The width of the copied portion equals the width
     of the right side section, or the available width on the left side starting from column 1,
     whichever is smaller.
