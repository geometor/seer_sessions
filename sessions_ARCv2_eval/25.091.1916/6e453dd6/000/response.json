            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on 2D grids of pixels with different colors. The grid dimensions vary between examples but remain constant from input to output within a single example.\n2.  **Key Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), magenta (6), and gray (5) in the input. The output introduces red (2).\n3.  **Dominant Feature:** A single, continuous vertical line of gray (5) pixels is present in all input and output grids. This line acts as a crucial separator, dividing the grid into a left and a right section.\n4.  **Left Section (Input):** Contains a background of magenta (6) with various shapes formed by white (0) pixels.\n5.  **Right Section (Input):** Predominantly magenta (6), sometimes extending to the grid edge, sometimes bounded by the gray line.\n6.  **Transformation Core:** The transformation modifies both the left and right sections based on the patterns of white pixels found on the left side of the gray line in the input.\n7.  **Left Section (Output):** The white (0) pixels originally present on the left side in the input are replaced by magenta (6) pixels in the output.\n8.  **Right Section (Output):** The content of the right section in the output depends on the properties of the white shapes on the corresponding rows of the input's left section.\n    *   **Condition:** If a connected component (shape) of white pixels on the left side contains a vertical segment of 2 or more contiguous white pixels, a specific transformation (red fill) occurs on the right.\n    *   **Red Fill Transformation:** For all rows spanned by such a white shape, the entire right section (from the gray line to the right edge) is filled with red (2).\n    *   **Copy Transformation:** If a row's left section contains white pixels, but *none* of the connected white shapes involving that row meet the vertical segment condition, a different transformation occurs. The pattern of pixels from the *second column up to a specific width* of the input's left section is copied to the output's right section. The width copied is equal to the width of the right section.\n    *   **No White Pixels:** If a row's left section contains no white pixels, the copy transformation still applies, effectively copying the magenta background pattern from the relevant slice of the input's left section to the output's right section.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"
