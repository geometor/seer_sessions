task_description: Replace the fourth pattern block with a copy of one of the first three, based on foreground color priority.

grid_properties:
  - size: Constant 7x25 for all examples.
  - structure: Contains a 1-pixel border frame and internal vertical separators of the same border color.
  - separators: Vertical columns of the border color divide the inner area (rows 1-5) into four equally sized rectangular regions (5x5 pixels each).
    - Region 1 (P1): Columns 1-5
    - Region 2 (P2): Columns 7-11
    - Region 3 (P3): Columns 13-17
    - Region 4 (P4): Columns 19-23

object_definitions:
  - object: Border
    definition: The outermost frame (row 0, row 6, col 0, col 24) and the vertical separator columns (col 6, col 12, col 18).
    properties:
      - color: Varies per example (gray, blue, magenta, yellow).
  - object: Pattern_Region
    definition: One of the four 5x5 areas (P1, P2, P3, P4) defined by the separators.
  - object: Background_Color
    definition: The color that fills the P4 region in the input. This color also appears as part of P1, P2, and P3.
    properties:
      - color: Varies per example (yellow, azure, maroon, white). Coincides with the color filling P4.
  - object: Foreground_Object
    definition: The connected pixels within P1, P2, or P3 that are *not* the Background_Color.
    properties:
      - color: The distinguishing color of the pattern (e.g., magenta in P1/Ex1, red in P2/Ex1, green in P3/Ex1).
      - shape: Forms a distinct shape within the 5x5 region.

relationships:
  - P1, P2, P3 each contain one Background_Color and one Foreground_Object color.
  - P4 contains only the Background_Color in the input.
  - The Background_Color is consistent across P1, P2, P3, and P4 within a single example.
  - The Foreground_Object colors for P1, P2, P3 are unique within those three patterns for each example.

actions:
  - action: Identify
    parameters: [Border Color, Separator Columns, Pattern Regions (P1, P2, P3, P4), Background_Color, Foreground_Object Colors (F1, F2, F3)]
  - action: Select_Pattern_To_Copy
    logic: |
      Check Foreground_Object colors {F1, F2, F3}:
      1. If Red (2) is present, select the pattern (P1, P2, or P3) whose Foreground_Object color is Red (2).
      2. Else if Blue (1) is present, select the pattern (P1, P2, or P3) whose Foreground_Object color is Blue (1).
      (Assumption: One of these conditions will always be met based on examples).
  - action: Copy_Paste
    source: The selected pattern region (P1, P2, or P3) from the input grid.
    destination: The P4 pattern region in the output grid.
  - action: Preserve
    elements: Border, Separator Columns, P1, P2, P3 regions remain unchanged from input to output.

transformation_summary: The fourth internal pattern area, initially filled with the background color, is overwritten by copying the pattern from the first three areas that contains the highest priority foreground color (Priority: Red > Blue).
