**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grids are composed of a regular pattern of smaller subgrids (blocks) separated by single-pixel-thick lines. These lines form a grid structure.
2.  **Separator Color:** The color of the separating lines is consistent throughout the input grid and is the same as the color of the pixel at the top-left corner (0,0). In `train_1`, it's blue (1); in `train_2`, it's green (3).
3.  **Content Blocks:** The areas enclosed by the separator lines contain distinct patterns. These content blocks are square. In the examples, these blocks are 5x5 pixels.
4.  **Block Arrangement:** The content blocks are arranged in a larger grid format within the input. `train_1` has a 3x3 arrangement of content blocks, while `train_2` has a 3x4 arrangement.
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to isolate and extract only the rightmost column of these content blocks from the input grid.
6.  **Output Structure:** The output grid reconstructs the vertical structure of the rightmost column of blocks from the input. It maintains the original height, the vertical arrangement of the selected blocks, and the separator lines (both horizontal and the vertical lines immediately surrounding the blocks). The width of the output corresponds to the width of one content block plus its left and right separator lines.

**Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - object: grid_structure
    description: Input consists of a grid formed by separator lines.
    properties:
      line_thickness: 1 pixel
      separator_color: Determined by the pixel at (0,0). (Blue in train_1, Green in train_2)
  - object: content_block
    description: Square areas enclosed by the separator grid lines containing distinct patterns.
    properties:
      size: Determined by the spacing between separator lines (e.g., 5x5 if lines are 6 pixels apart).
      arrangement: Arranged in a 2D grid layout (e.g., 3x3 in train_1, 3x4 in train_2).
      location: Defined by their top-left corner relative to the separator grid.
relationships:
  - type: separation
    object1: content_block
    object2: content_block
    details: Adjacent content blocks are separated by a single line of the separator color, both horizontally and vertically.
  - type: selection
    object: content_block
    criteria: Belongs to the rightmost column in the arrangement of content blocks within the input grid.
actions:
  - action: identify
    actor: system
    target: separator_color
    method: Check pixel color at (0,0).
  - action: identify
    actor: system
    target: grid_spacing
    method: Find the distance between parallel separator lines.
  - action: identify
    actor: system
    target: content_block_locations
    method: Determine the coordinates of the top-left corner of each content block.
  - action: extract
    actor: system
    target: content_blocks
    condition: Located in the rightmost column of the block arrangement.
  - action: construct
    actor: system
    target: output_grid
    components:
      - extracted content blocks
      - separator lines (horizontal and immediate vertical)
    details: Vertically stack the extracted blocks, placing them within a new grid structure using the original separator color. The output width accommodates one block and its vertical separators. The output height matches the input height.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the `separator_color` by reading the color of the pixel at coordinate (0,0) in the input grid.
2.  Identify the grid pattern formed by the `separator_color`. Find the row indices and column indices where the separator lines occur. These lines are 1 pixel thick.
3.  Calculate the `spacing` between consecutive parallel separator lines (this will be constant, e.g., 6 in the examples). The content blocks between the lines will have dimensions (`spacing`-1) x (`spacing`-1).
4.  Identify the column index of the separator line that defines the left edge of the *rightmost* column of content blocks. Let this be `rightmost_block_start_col`. This corresponds to `1 + max_col_index * spacing`, where `max_col_index` is the index of the last column of blocks.
5.  Identify the row indices where content blocks start. These are `1 + row_index * spacing`.
6.  Extract all the square content blocks of size (`spacing`-1) x (`spacing`-1) whose top-left corner is at `(1 + row_index * spacing, rightmost_block_start_col)` for all valid `row_index` values.
7.  Create a new output grid with the same height as the input grid and a width of `spacing` + 1.
8.  Fill the output grid entirely with the `separator_color`.
9.  For each extracted content block (obtained in step 6), copy its pixels into the output grid. The top-left corner of the `i`-th extracted block (corresponding to `row_index = i`) should be placed at position `(1 + i * spacing, 1)` in the output grid.
