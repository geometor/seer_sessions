task_description: Modify specific 3x3 square objects within a grid by changing their internal pattern while preserving other objects and the background.

grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - dimensions: Variable (up to 30x30)

objects:
  - type: colored_pixels
  - properties:
      - color: blue(1), red(2), green(3), yellow(4), gray(5), magenta(6), orange(7), azure(8), maroon(9)
      - shape: Can be diverse, including solid 3x3 squares, crosses, irregular structures.
      - contiguity: Pixels of the same color forming an object are connected (usually side-by-side, potentially diagonal).

target_objects:
  - criteria:
      - is_solid_square: True
      - size: 3x3 pixels
      - color: Not in [white(0), gray(5), azure(8), maroon(9)] # Based on observed unaffected colors/shapes
  - examples:
      - train_1: green(3) square, red(2) square
      - train_2: blue(1) square, red(2) square, green(3) square, yellow(4) square
      - train_3: red(2) square, yellow(4) square, magenta(6) square

actions:
  - name: identify_target_squares
    description: Scan the input grid to find all objects meeting the target_objects criteria.
  - name: transform_square
    description: For each identified target square, modify its 3x3 area in the output grid.
    details:
      - Preserve original color at the 4 corners and the center pixel.
      - Change the 4 edge pixels (top-middle, bottom-middle, left-middle, right-middle) to white(0).
  - name: preserve_others
    description: All pixels and objects not part of a target square transformation remain unchanged in the output grid.

relationships:
  - input_output_mapping: Pixel-wise copy, except for the internal pixels of identified 3x3 target squares.
  - position: Transformed squares maintain their original top-left coordinate. Other objects remain in their original positions.
