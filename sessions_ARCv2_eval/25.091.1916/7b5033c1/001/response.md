"""
Determine the background color by finding the most frequently occurring pixel value
in the input grid. Initialize an empty list to store the foreground pixel colors.
Iterate through each row of the input grid, from the top row to the bottom row.
For each row, iterate through each pixel (cell) from the left column to the
right column. For each pixel, compare its color value to the identified
background color. If the pixel's color is different from the background color,
append the pixel's color value to the list. After iterating through all pixels
in the input grid, convert the collected list of foreground pixel colors into a
grid with a single column and as many rows as there are items in the list. This
is the final output grid.
