The height N varies depending on the input.\n3.  **Background Color:** Each input grid has a dominant color that acts as the background. In `train_1`, it's azure (8); in `train_2`, it's blue (1). This background color seems to be the most frequent color in the input grid.\n4.  **Foreground Pixels:** Pixels that are *not* the background color are considered foreground pixels. These are the pixels of interest.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the background color, then iterating through the input grid (likely row by row, then column by column within each row) and collecting the color values of all foreground pixels in the order they are encountered.\n6.  **Output Construction:** The collected list of foreground pixel colors is then arranged into a single column to form the output grid. The height of the output grid equals the total count of foreground pixels in the input.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

For each row, iterate through each pixel (cell) from the left column to the right column.\n5.  For each pixel, compare its color value to the identified background color.\n6.  If the pixel's color is different from the background color, append the pixel's color value to the list created in step 2.\n7.  After iterating through all pixels in the input grid, convert the collected list of foreground pixel colors into a grid with a single column and as many rows as there are items in the list. This is the final output grid."
