The orange (7) pixels appear to be the gray (8) pixels that are *not* reachable from the magenta (6) pixel without crossing a blue (1) barrier.

Identify all gray (8) pixels that are reachable from the starting point by moving horizontally or vertically through adjacent gray (8) pixels only. Blue (1) pixels block movement.
