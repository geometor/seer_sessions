"""
Identify the background color (most frequent color).
Identify all contiguous objects (shapes) of non-background colors.
Determine the largest non-background object as the main boundary.
Identify all other non-background objects.

Check if the main boundary encloses any background regions by performing a flood fill from the grid edges on background pixels. Background pixels not reached are considered enclosed.

If enclosed background regions exist:
  Determine the fill color by finding the most frequent non-background color within the original pixels of the enclosed region(s).
  The fill target is the set of enclosed background pixels.
Else (no enclosed regions):
  Determine the fill color from the smallest non-background, non-boundary object (by pixel count).
  The fill target is the set of background pixels reachable from the grid edge.

Create the output grid by copying the input grid and replacing the pixels in the fill target region with the determined fill color.
