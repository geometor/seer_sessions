Key elements are the background color, boundary-forming objects, potential fill colors derived from other objects, and determining whether the fill occurs in regions connected to the grid edge (\"outside\") or regions enclosed by boundaries (\"inside\").\n\n    1.  **Background Identification:** The most frequent color in the grid typically serves as the background.\n    2.  **Boundary Identification:** Contiguous shapes of non-background colors act as boundaries that constrain the fill operation. Often, one main boundary shape can be identified (e.g., the largest non-background object).\n    3.  **Fill Color Determination:** The color used for filling is derived from specific, often unique or small, non-background, non-boundary objects present in the input grid.\n    4.  **Fill Region Determination:** The core logic distinguishes between two types of fill regions:\n        *   **Outside Fill:** Targets background pixels that are connected to the grid's edge. This occurs when the main boundary shape does *not* completely enclose any background region. The fill color is typically taken from the smallest non-background, non-boundary object.\n        *   **Inside Fill:** Targets background pixels that are completely enclosed by the main boundary shape (cannot reach the grid edge via background pixels). This occurs when such enclosed regions exist. The fill color is determined by the color(s) found within the enclosed region in the input grid (often the most frequent non-background color within that region).\n    5.  **Transformation:** The final output grid is created by replacing the pixels in the determined fill region (either inside or outside) with the determined fill color, while leaving all other pixels (boundary objects, other objects) unchanged.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

The fill operation targets these enclosed background pixels.\n        b.  Examine the pixels within these enclosed regions in the original input grid.

The fill operation targets the background pixels that *are* reachable from the grid edge (identified in step 5).\n        b.
