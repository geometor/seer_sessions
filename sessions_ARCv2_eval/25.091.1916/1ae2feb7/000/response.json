            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Separator:** Each input grid contains a single vertical line of red pixels (color 2). This line acts as a separator, dividing the grid into a left region and a right region.\n2.  **Input Patterns:** To the left of the red line, some rows contain horizontal sequences of non-white pixels. These sequences are the primary input patterns. They vary in color, length, and composition.\n3.  **Transformation Trigger:** The presence of a non-white pattern in a row to the left of the red line triggers a transformation in the corresponding row to the right of the red line.\n4.  **Output Area:** The region to the right of the red line is initially white (color 0) in the input. In the output, this area is filled with new patterns in the rows corresponding to the input patterns.\n5.  **Invariant Regions:** The red vertical line itself, the area to its left, and any rows that were entirely white to the left of the red line remain unchanged in the output.\n6.  **Pattern Generation:** The patterns generated in the output area seem derived from the properties (colors, sequence) of the input pattern in the same row. The specific generation rule depends on the colors present in the input pattern, particularly the first and last non-white colors. The generated pattern is tiled or repeated to fill the available space to the right of the red line.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Let `lenS = len(S)`.\n    e.  **Determine Base Pattern (P):**\n        i.  If `last_color` is azure (8), the base pattern `P` is `[azure (8)]`.\n        ii. Else if `first_color` is red (2) and `last_color` is blue (1), the base pattern `P` is `[blue (1), red (2)]`.\n        iii. Else if `first_color` is green (3) and `last_color` is yellow (4), the base pattern `P` is `[yellow (4), white (0), yellow (4), green (3)]`.\n        iv. Otherwise (default case), the base pattern `P` consists of the `first_color` followed by `lenS - 1` white (0) pixels. If `lenS` is 1, `P` is just `[first_color]`.\n    f.  **Generate Tiled Output Pattern:** Create the final pattern for the row (`OutPat`) by repeating the base pattern `P` until it fills the required width `W`. Calculate the number of full repetitions (`num_repeats = W // len(P)`) and the remaining length (`remainder = W % len(P)`). The `OutPat` is `P` concatenated `num_repeats` times, followed by the first `remainder` elements of `P`.\n    g.  **Update Output Grid:** Replace the segment of the output grid in row `r` to the right of the separator with the generated `OutPat`: `output_grid[r, C+1 : C+1+W] = OutPat`.\n5.  **Return Result:** After processing all rows, return the modified output grid."
