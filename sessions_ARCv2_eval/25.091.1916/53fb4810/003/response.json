Vertical: Yellow (4) is directly above Red (2) in the same column 'c'.\n2. Horizontal: Yellow (4) is directly to the left of Red (2) in the same row, involving columns 'c' and 'c+1'.\n\nBased on the trigger type and location, specific columns are filled with an alternating pattern of yellow (4) and red (2) from the top edge (row 0) down to, but not including, the row containing the topmost blue (1) pixel in that column. If no blue pixel exists in a column, the pattern fills the entire column height.\n\n- If the trigger is vertical (4 above 2) in column 'c':\n    - The target column is 'c'.\n    - The alternating pattern starts with red (2) and alternates with yellow (4).\n- If the trigger is horizontal (4 left of 2) involving columns 'c' (yellow) and 'c+1' (red):\n    - Target columns are 'c' and 'c+1'.\n    - Column 'c' pattern starts with yellow (4), alternates with red (2).\n    - Column 'c+1' pattern starts with red (2), alternates with yellow (4).\n\nAll other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_highest_blue(grid, col_index):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the row index of the topmost blue (1) pixel in a given column.\n    Returns the grid height if no blue pixel is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    height = grid.shape[0]\n    for r in range(height):\n        if grid[r, col_index] == 1:\n            return r\n    return height # Return height if no blue pixel is found\n\ndef apply_pattern(output_grid, col_index, end_row, color1, color2):\n    \"\"\"Applies the alternating pattern to a specific column.\"\"\"\n    for row in range(end_row):\n        if row % 2 == 0:\n            output_grid[row, col_index] = color1\n        else:\n            output_grid[row, col_index] = color2\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    \n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid represented as a list of lists.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_grid = grid.copy()\n    height, width = grid.shape\n\n    trigger_found = False\n    trigger_type = None\n    trigger_col_c = -1\n    trigger_col_c1 = -1 # For horizontal trigger's second column\n\n    # Search for the first trigger (vertical or horizontal) in row-major order\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Check for vertical trigger (4 above 2)\n            if r + 1 < height and grid[r, c] == 4 and grid[r + 1, c] == 2:\n                trigger_type = 'vertical'\n                trigger_col_c = c\n                trigger_found = True\n                break\n            # Check for horizontal trigger (4 left of 2)\n            if c + 1 < width and grid[r, c] == 4 and grid[r, c + 1] == 2:\n                trigger_type = 'horizontal'\n                trigger_col_c = c\n                trigger_col_c1 = c + 1\n                trigger_found = True\n                break\n        if trigger_found:\n            break\n            \n    # If no trigger was found, return the original grid\n    if not trigger_found:\n        return output_grid.tolist()\n\n    # Apply transformation based on trigger type\n    if trigger_type == 'vertical':\n        # Find the blue boundary for the affected column\n        blue_row = find_highest_blue(grid, trigger_col_c)\n        # Apply pattern: starts with red (2), alternates with yellow (4)\n        apply_pattern(output_grid, trigger_col_c, blue_row, 2, 4)\n        \n    elif trigger_type == 'horizontal':\n        # Process column c (where yellow 4 was)\n        blue_row_c = find_highest_blue(grid, trigger_col_c)\n        # Apply pattern: starts with yellow (4), alternates with red (2)\n        apply_pattern(output_grid, trigger_col_c, blue_row_c, 4, 2)\n        \n        # Process column c+1 (where red 2 was)\n        blue_row_c1 = find_highest_blue(grid, trigger_col_c1)\n         # Apply pattern: starts with red (2), alternates with yellow (4)\n        apply_pattern(output_grid, trigger_col_c1, blue_row_c1, 2, 4)\n\n    # Return the modified grid as a list of lists\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
