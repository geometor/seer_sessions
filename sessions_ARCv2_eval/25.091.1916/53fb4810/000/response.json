            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Background:** The grids predominantly use azure (8) as the background color.\n2.  **Key Colors:** Yellow (4), Red (2), and Blue (1) appear to play crucial roles in the transformation. Other colors like green (3) and the background azure (8) might be present but seem unaffected or overwritten.\n3.  **Trigger Pattern:** There's a specific spatial relationship between a yellow (4) pixel and a red (2) pixel that seems to initiate the main transformation. In `train_1`, yellow is directly above red (`4` at (11,10), `2` at (12,10)). In `train_2`, yellow is directly to the left of red (`4` at (11,8), `2` at (11,9)).\n4.  **Blocking Pattern:** Blue (1) pixels appear to define the lower boundary for the transformation. The transformation affects columns containing the trigger pattern but stops just above the first blue (1) pixel encountered from the top in those columns.\n5.  **Output Pattern:** A vertical alternating pattern using yellow (4) and red (2) is generated in the output grid. This pattern fills one or more columns from the top edge (row 0) down to the row just above the blocking blue (1) pixel(s).\n6.  **Pattern Determination:**\n    *   The *columns* affected are those containing the trigger pixels.\n    *   The *colors* used in the pattern are yellow (4) and red (2).\n    *   The *starting color* of the alternating pattern depends on the orientation of the trigger:\n        *   If yellow is *above* red (vertical trigger), the pattern starts with red (2).\n        *   If yellow is *left of* red (horizontal trigger), the pattern starts with yellow (4).\n    *   The *vertical extent* of the pattern is determined by the location of the topmost blue (1) pixel in each affected column.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
