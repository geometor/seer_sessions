Vertical: Yellow (4) is directly above Red (2) in the same column 'c'.\n2. Horizontal: Yellow (4) is directly to the left of Red (2) in the same row, involving columns 'c' and 'c+1'.\n\nBased on the trigger type and location, specific columns are filled with an alternating pattern of yellow (4) and red (2) from the top edge (row 0) down to, but not including, the row containing the topmost blue (1) pixel in that column. If no blue pixel exists in a column, the pattern fills the entire column height.\n\nThe starting color of the alternating pattern in each affected column depends on the color of the trigger pixel located within that column:\n- If the column contains the yellow (4) part of the trigger, the pattern starts with yellow (4) and alternates with red (2).\n- If the column contains the red (2) part of the trigger, the pattern starts with red (2) and alternates with yellow (4).\n\nAll other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_highest_blue(grid, col_index):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the row index of the topmost blue (1) pixel in a given column.\n    Returns the grid height if no blue pixel is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    height = grid.shape[0]\n    # Check if col_index is valid\n    if col_index < 0 or col_index >= grid.shape[1]:\n        return height # Treat invalid columns as having no blue boundary\n        \n    for r in range(height):\n        if grid[r, col_index] == 1:\n            return r\n    return height # Return height if no blue pixel is found\n\ndef apply_pattern(output_grid, col_index, end_row, start_color, alternate_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the alternating pattern (start_color, alternate_color, ...) \n    to a specific column up to the end_row (exclusive).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if col_index is valid before applying pattern\n    if col_index < 0 or col_index >= output_grid.shape[1]:\n        return \n        \n    for row in range(end_row):\n        if row % 2 == 0:\n            output_grid[row, col_index] = start_color\n        else:\n            output_grid[row, col_index] = alternate_color\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    \n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid represented as a list of lists.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    # Initialize output grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = grid.copy()\n    height, width = grid.shape\n\n    trigger_found = False\n    trigger_type = None\n    trigger_col_c = -1  # Column containing yellow (4) or the only column for vertical\n    trigger_col_c1 = -1 # Column containing red (2) for horizontal trigger\n\n    # Scan row-major to find the first trigger\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Check for vertical trigger (4 above 2)\n            if r + 1 < height and grid[r, c] == 4 and grid[r + 1, c] == 2:\n                trigger_type = 'vertical'\n                trigger_col_c = c # In vertical, both trigger parts are in the same column\n                trigger_found = True\n                break # Found the first trigger, stop searching columns\n            # Check for horizontal trigger (4 left of 2)\n            if c + 1 < width and grid[r, c] == 4 and grid[r, c + 1] == 2:\n                trigger_type = 'horizontal'\n                trigger_col_c = c   # Column with yellow (4)\n                trigger_col_c1 = c + 1 # Column with red (2)\n                trigger_found = True\n                break # Found the first trigger, stop searching columns\n        if trigger_found:\n            break # Found the first trigger, stop searching rows\n            \n    # If no trigger was found, return the original grid copy\n    if not trigger_found:\n        return output_grid.tolist()\n\n    # Apply transformation based on the identified trigger\n    if trigger_type == 'vertical':\n        # The column contains the red part of the trigger (at r+1, c)\n        start_color = 2\n        alternate_color = 4\n        # Find the blue boundary for the affected column\n        blue_row = find_highest_blue(grid, trigger_col_c)\n        # Apply pattern starting with red (2)\n        apply_pattern(output_grid, trigger_col_c, blue_row, start_color, alternate_color)\n        \n    elif trigger_type == 'horizontal':\n        # Process column c (where yellow 4 was)\n        start_color_c = 4\n        alternate_color_c = 2\n        blue_row_c = find_highest_blue(grid, trigger_col_c)\n        # Apply pattern starting with yellow (4)\n        apply_pattern(output_grid, trigger_col_c, blue_row_c, start_color_c, alternate_color_c)\n        \n        # Process column c+1 (where red 2 was)\n        start_color_c1 = 2\n        alternate_color_c1 = 4\n        blue_row_c1 = find_highest_blue(grid, trigger_col_c1)\n         # Apply pattern starting with red (2)\n        apply_pattern(output_grid, trigger_col_c1, blue_row_c1, start_color_c1, alternate_color_c1)\n\n    # Return the modified grid as a list of lists\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
