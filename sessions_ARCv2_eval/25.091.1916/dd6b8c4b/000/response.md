Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of colored pixels. Orange (7) often acts as a background or border.
2.  **Key Objects:** The central element is a contiguous object composed of green (3) pixels, usually containing a single red (2) pixel. Other colors like magenta (6) and maroon (9) exist but don't seem to be the primary focus of the transformation itself, though they might influence it.
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation involves changing *some* or *all* of the green (3) pixels within the green/red object to maroon (9). The red (2) pixel always remains unchanged. Pixels outside this object also remain unchanged.
4.  **Conditionality:** The specific green pixels that change depend on the context. Comparing the three examples reveals that the *same* internal green/red structure (a 3x3 block with red in the center-left position relative to the block) results in different outputs. This implies the transformation is influenced by factors *external* to the green/red object itself.
5.  **External Influence:** The key difference between the examples lies in the colors of the pixels immediately surrounding (cardinally adjacent to) the green/red object.
    *   In `train_1`, the object is bordered by orange (7) on the top, bottom, and left
