*   **Perception:**
    The task involves transforming a 6x6 input grid into a larger 16x16 output grid. The input grid always contains a background color (orange, 7) and some pixels of another color arranged in a pattern. The output grid is constructed based on analyzing 2x2 blocks within the input grid. The output grid has a tiled structure with white (0) borders separating 5x5 regions. Within each 5x5 region, a central 2x2 pattern is determined by the content of the corresponding 2x2 input block. If the 2x2 input block contains only the background orange color (7), the central 2x2 output pattern is solid orange (7). If the 2x2 input block contains *any* non-orange pixel, the central 2x2 output pattern becomes a specific checkerboard pattern of maroon (9) and orange (7). The specific non-orange color in the input does not influence the output pattern, only its presence does.

        details: For each input 2x2 block at grid index (row_idx, col_idx) [0-based, from 0 to 2]:
          - calculate_target_coordinates: Top-left corner (r, c) in the output grid is (row_idx * 5 + 1, col_idx * 5 + 1).

    grid_structure:
      input: Treated as 3x3 blocks of 2x2 pixels.
      output: Composed of 3x3 tiled 5x5 regions, separated by 1-pixel white borders. The central 2x2 area of each 5x5 region contains the determined pattern.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a new 16x16 grid and fill it entirely with the white color (0). This will be the output grid.
    2.  Iterate through the 6x6 input grid by considering it as a 3x3 grid of 2x2 blocks. The top-left corners of these blocks in the input are at (0,0), (0,2), (0,4), (2,0), (2,2), (2,4), (4,0), (4,2), (4,4).
    3.  For each 2x2 block from the input grid:
        a.  Examine the four pixels within the block.
        b.  Check if *any* of these four pixels has a color different from orange (7).
        c.  Determine the 2x2 pattern to place in the output grid:
            i.  If *all* four pixels in the input block are orange (7), the pattern is `[[7, 7], [7, 7]]` (solid orange).
            ii. If *at least one* pixel in the input block is *not* orange (7), the pattern is `[[9, 7], [7, 9]]` (maroon/orange checkerboard).
        d.  Determine the position in the output grid to place this 2x2 pattern. If the input block's top-left corner is at `(input_r, input_c)`, the output pattern's top-left corner will be at `(output_r, output_c)`, where `output_r = (input_r // 2) * 5 + 1` and `output_c = (input_c // 2) * 5 + 1`.
        e.  Copy the determined 2x2 pattern into the output grid at the calculated `(output_r, output_c)` position.
    4.  Return the completed 16x16 output grid.
