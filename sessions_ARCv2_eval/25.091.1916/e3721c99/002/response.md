## Assessment and Strategy

The initial code failed because it was based on an incorrect hypothesis derived solely from the first example: that the *key pattern* must fit *inside* the *gray object pattern*. Analysis of both examples reveals this is often not the case. Furthermore, the initial code incorrectly assumed the 'key' shapes were constant across all examples, while Example 2 clearly shows different key shapes (specifically the blue key).

The strategy is to:
1.  **Dynamically Identify Keys:** Extract the key shapes and their properties (color, relative pattern, pixel count, bounding box dimensions) from the area above the separator line for *each* input grid individually.
2.  **Reverse the Matching Logic:** The evidence suggests the correct relationship is that the *gray object's pattern* must be found *within* the *key object's pattern*.
3.  **Refine the Tie-Breaker:** When a gray object's pattern is found within multiple key patterns, the original tie-breaker (largest key pixel count) was incorrect. A new tie-breaker rule is needed, likely based on the properties of the matching keys. Based on analysis, the rule appears to be:
    *   Choose the key(s) with the smallest bounding box area (height * width).
    *   If there's a tie in bounding box area, choose the key with the largest pixel count among the tied keys.
4.  **Implement and Verify:** Update the code with dynamic key identification, the reversed matching logic, and the new tie-breaker, then re-verify against the training examples.

## Metrics and Analysis

We need to analyze the relationship between gray input shapes and their corresponding key shapes based on the correct output mapping.

**Tool Code for Analysis (Conceptual - requires running the `find_objects` and `get_relative_pattern` functions from the previous attempt on the provided examples):**
