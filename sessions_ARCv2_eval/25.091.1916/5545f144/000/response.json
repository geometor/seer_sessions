The output grid appears to be a horizontal slice (a subset of columns) of the input grid, retaining the original height.\n2.  **Key Colors:** Each grid uses multiple colors. There's typically a dominant background color. Other colors form distinct patterns.\n3.  **Pattern Identification:**\n    *   **Vertical Lines:** In each input grid, there is one color (distinct from the background) that forms one or more perfect vertical lines spanning the entire height of the grid. Let's call this the `line_color`.\n    *   **Scattered Pixels:** There is another color (distinct from the background and the `line_color`) whose pixels are scattered across the grid. Let's call this the `scatter_color`.\n    *   **Background:** The most frequent color fills the remaining space.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying these elements (`background_color`, `line_color`, `scatter_color`) and the columns containing the vertical lines. These lines act as delimiters, dividing the grid horizontally into regions. The core logic seems to be selecting one of these regions based on the distribution of the `scatter_color` pixels. Specifically, the region containing the highest number of `scatter_color` pixels is extracted to form the output grid.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Select the region that has the highest count.\n7.  **Generate Output:** Construct the output grid by extracting the full-height slice of the input grid corresponding exactly to the columns included in the selected region. The output grid will have the same height as the input but a width equal to the width of the selected region."
