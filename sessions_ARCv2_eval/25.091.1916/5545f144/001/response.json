Identify the most frequent color (background) and the two other unique colors present.\n2.  Determine which non-background color forms full-height vertical lines (line_color) \n    and find the columns (line_columns) where these occur. The remaining \n    non-background color is the scatter_color.\n3.  Define horizontal regions based on the spaces between/around the line_columns. \n    Regions are defined by column ranges: [0, c1), [c1+1, c2), ..., [clast+1, width).\n4.  For each region, count the number of pixels matching the scatter_color.\n5.  Identify the region with the maximum count of scatter_color pixels. If there's a tie,\n    the leftmost region (smallest starting column index) is chosen.\n6.  Create the output grid by extracting the columns defined by the selected region \n    from the input grid, maintaining the original height.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _is_vertical_line(grid, col_idx, color):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a column consists entirely of a specific color.\"\"\"\n    # Helper function to check if all pixels in a given column match the specified color.\n    height = grid.shape[0]\n    return np.all(grid[:, col_idx] == color)\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Extracts a horizontal section of the input grid based on vertical line delimiters\n    and the density of a specific 'scatter' color within the delimited regions.\n    \"\"\"\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = grid.shape\n\n    # Step 1: Identify background, potential line, and potential scatter colors.\n    unique_elements, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)\n\n    # Basic validation: Need at least 3 colors for the described logic.\n    if len(unique_elements) < 3:\n        # print(f\"Warning: Expected at least 3 unique colors, found {len(unique_elements)}.
