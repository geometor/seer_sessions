            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Background Color:** The grids predominantly use azure (8) as the background color.\n2.  **Source Objects/Pixels:** There are distinct regions or pixels within the grid that are neither the background color (azure 8) nor green (3). These seem to be the sources of the transformation. Examples include maroon (9), blue (1), yellow (4), magenta (6), red (2), and orange (7).\n3.  **Barrier Color:** Green (3) pixels often form borders or enclosures around the source pixels/regions. These green pixels seem to act as barriers.\n4.  **Transformation Action:** The core action appears to be projecting \"rays\" outwards from the source pixels.\n5.  **Ray Behavior:**\n    *   Rays originate from each source pixel (non-azure, non-green).\n    *   Rays travel outwards in the 8 cardinal and diagonal directions.\n    *   The color of the ray is the same as the color of the source pixel it originated from.\n    *   Rays overwrite azure (8) background pixels in their path.\n    *   Rays stop traveling in a specific direction if they hit the grid boundary or encounter *any* non-azure (8) pixel in the original input grid. This means they stop at the green (3) borders, other source pixels, or the source pixel itself if tracing back towards it (though the algorithm starts tracing *from* the adjacent pixel).\n6.  **Output Grid:** The final output grid is the input grid modified by the projected rays overwriting the azure (8) background pixels. The original source pixels and green (3) pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
