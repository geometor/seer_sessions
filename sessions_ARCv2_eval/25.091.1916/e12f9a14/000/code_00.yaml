task_description: Project rays from colored source pixels until they hit a non-background pixel or grid edge.

definitions:
  background_color: 8 # azure
  source_colors: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9] # any color except background (8) and green (3)
  barrier_condition_color: 8 # azure - rays only travel *through* this color
  directions:
    - [-1, 0]  # N
    - [-1, 1]  # NE
    - [0, 1]   # E
    - [1, 1]   # SE
    - [1, 0]   # S
    - [1, -1]  # SW
    - [0, -1]  # W
    - [-1, -1] # NW

grid_elements:
  - type: background
    color: 8 # azure
  - type: source_pixel
    color: any color in source_colors
    description: Origin point for projecting rays.
  - type: other_pixel
    color: any color not 8 (e.g., green 3, or another source_color)
    description: Acts as a barrier, stopping rays.

transformation_logic:
  - action: initialize_output
    description: Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
  - action: identify_sources
    input: input_grid
    output: list of coordinates [(r1, c1, color1), (r2, c2, color2), ...] for all source_pixels.
  - action: project_rays_from_sources
    input: list_of_sources, input_grid, output_grid
    process:
      - For each source (r, c, source_color) in the list:
        - For each direction [dr, dc] in directions:
          - Initialize current position (curr_r, curr_c) = (r + dr, c + dc).
          - Loop while (curr_r, curr_c) is within grid boundaries:
            - Get the color 'target_color' at (curr_r, curr_c) from the **input_grid**.
            - If 'target_color' is the background_color (8):
              - Set the color at (curr_r, curr_c) in the **output_grid** to 'source_color'.
              - Update current position: curr_r += dr, curr_c += dc.
            - Else (target_color is not background_color):
              - Stop tracing in this direction (break the inner loop).
  - final_output: The modified output_grid after all rays are projected.

relationships:
  - Rays originate from source_pixels.
  - Rays travel through background_color pixels.
  - Rays are stopped by any non-background_color pixel (based on the input grid state) or the grid boundary.
  - Rays modify the output grid by changing background_color pixels to the source_color.
