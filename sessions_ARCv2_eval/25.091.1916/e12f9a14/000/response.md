Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Background Color:** The grids predominantly use azure (8) as the background color.
2.  **Source Objects/Pixels:** There are distinct regions or pixels within the grid that are neither the background color (azure 8) nor green (3). These seem to be the sources of the transformation. Examples include maroon (9), blue (1), yellow (4), magenta (6), red (2), and orange (7).
3.  **Barrier Color:** Green (3) pixels often form borders or enclosures around the source pixels/regions. These green pixels seem to act as barriers.
4.  **Transformation Action:** The core action appears to be projecting "rays" outwards from the source pixels.
5.  **Ray Behavior:**
    *   Rays originate from each source pixel (non-azure, non-green).
    *   Rays travel outwards in the 8 cardinal and diagonal directions.
    *   The color of the ray is the same as the color of the source pixel it originated from.
    *   Rays overwrite azure (8) background pixels in their path.
    *   Rays stop traveling in a specific direction if they hit the grid boundary or encounter *any* non-azure (8) pixel in the original input grid. This means they stop at the green (3) borders, other source pixels, or the source pixel itself if tracing back towards it (though the algorithm starts tracing *from* the adjacent pixel).
6.  **Output Grid:** The final output grid is the input grid modified by the projected rays overwriting the azure (8) background pixels. The original source pixels and green (3) pixels remain unchanged.

**Facts (YAML):**

definitions:
  background_color: 8 # azure

transformation_logic:
  - action: initialize_output
    description: Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
  - action: identify_sources
    input: input_grid
    output: list of coordinates [(r1, c1, color1), (r2, c2, color2), ...] for all source_pixels.
  - action: project_rays_from_sources
    input: list_of_sources, input_grid, output_grid
    process:
      - For each source (r, c, source_color) in the list:
        - For each direction [dr, dc] in directions:
          - Initialize current position (curr_r, curr_c) = (r + dr, c + dc).
          - Loop while (curr_r, curr_c) is within grid boundaries:
            - Get the color 'target_color' at (curr_r, curr_c) from the **input_grid**.
            - If 'target_color' is the background_color (8):
              - Set the color at (curr_r, curr_c) in the **output_grid** to 'source_color'.
              - Update current position: curr_r += dr, curr_c += dc.
            - Else (target_color is not background_color):
              - Stop tracing in this direction (break the inner loop).
  - final_output: The modified output_grid after all rays are projected.

relationships:
  - Rays originate from source_pixels.
  - Rays travel through background_color pixels.
  - Rays are stopped by any non-background_color pixel (based on the input grid state) or the grid boundary.
  - Rays modify the output grid by changing background_color pixels to the source_color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid; this will be the output grid.
2.  Identify all pixels in the *input* grid whose color is *not* azure (8) and *not* green (3). These are the "source pixels". Remember the location `(row, column)` and color `C` of each source pixel.
3.  For each identified source pixel `(r, c)` with color `C`:
    a.  Consider all 8 directions (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest).
    b.  For each direction:
        i.  Start tracing from the pixel immediately adjacent to `(r, c)` in that direction. Let the current tracing position be `(curr_r, curr_c)`.
        ii. Check if `(curr_r, curr_c)` is within the grid boundaries. If not, stop tracing in this direction.
        iii. Examine the color of the pixel at `(curr_r, curr_c)` in the *original input grid*.
        iv. If the color in the *input grid* at `(curr_r, curr_c)` is azure (8):
            *   Change the color of the pixel at `(curr_r, curr_c)` in the *output grid* to the source pixel's color `C`.
            *   Move one step further in the current direction to update `(curr_r, curr_c)`.
            *   Repeat from step 3.b.ii.
        v.  If the color in the *input grid* at `(curr_r, curr_c)` is *not* azure (8), stop tracing in this direction.
4.  After processing all source pixels and all 8 directions for each, the final state of the output grid is the result.
