"""
Projects rays outwards from specific 'source' pixels (colors other than azure 8 and green 3) in the 8 cardinal and diagonal directions.
These rays travel through azure (8) background pixels, changing their color in the output grid to match the source pixel's color.
The rays stop when they hit the grid boundary or any pixel in the original input grid that is not azure (8).
The original source pixels and any non-azure (8) pixels from the input remain unchanged in the output.
