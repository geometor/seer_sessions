Okay, I will analyze the provided training examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are square grids (16x16 in all examples).
2.  **Background Color:** The color orange (7) appears to be the dominant background color in all examples. It fills most of the grid space and seems to replace removed elements.
3.  **Objects:** There are distinct clusters or shapes formed by contiguous pixels (sharing sides or corners) of colors other than orange (7). These non-orange clusters can be considered "objects".
4.  **Key Color for Change:** The white color (0) seems crucial. Objects containing white pixels are candidates for modification.
5.  **Condition for Change:** Objects are removed (replaced by orange 7) only if they meet two conditions:
    *   The object contains at least one white (0) pixel.
    *   The object is completely surrounded by the background color (orange 7). This means no pixel belonging to the object touches the grid boundary or another non-orange pixel that is part of a *different* object.
6.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying these specific objects (containing white and surrounded by orange) and replacing all their constituent pixels with the background color (orange 7). Objects that do not meet both conditions remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_size: Fixed 16x16 for all examples.
  background_color: 7 (orange)
  object_definition: A contiguous group of pixels (connected cardinally or diagonally) with colors other than the background_color.

transformation_elements:
  target_indicator_color: 0 (white)
  removal_condition_1: The object must contain at least one pixel of the target_indicator_color (white).
  removal_condition_2: The object must be fully enclosed by the background_color (orange). No pixel of the object can be adjacent (cardinally or diagonally) to the grid boundary or to a pixel of a different object.
  action: If both removal conditions are met, replace all pixels belonging to the identified object with the background_color (orange).
  otherwise: Pixels belonging to objects not meeting both conditions, or pixels that are already the background_color, remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Define the background color as orange (7).
3.  Identify all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a connected component of pixels (adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) that are *not* the background color.
4.  For each identified object:
    a.  Check if any pixel within the object has the color white (0).
    b.  Check if the object is entirely surrounded by the background color (orange 7). To do this, examine all pixels directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any pixel of the object. If all these adjacent pixels are either within the grid boundaries and have the background color (orange 7), then the object is considered surrounded. If any adjacent position is outside the grid or contains a non-background color pixel *not* belonging to the current object, it is *not* surrounded.
    c.  If *both* conditions (contains white AND is surrounded by orange) are true for the object:
        i.  Iterate through all pixels belonging to this object in the output grid.
        ii. Replace the color of each of these pixels with the background color (orange 7).
5.  Return the modified output grid.
