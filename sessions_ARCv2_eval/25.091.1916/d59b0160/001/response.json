An object is a connected \n   component of pixels (adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) that \n   are not the background color (orange, 7).\n2. For each identified object:\n   a. Check if it contains at least one white pixel (0).\n   b. Check if it is entirely surrounded by the background color (orange, 7). \n      This means no pixel of the object touches the grid boundary or is adjacent \n      (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a non-background pixel that \n      is not part of the same object.\n3. If both conditions (contains white AND is surrounded by orange) are true \n   for an object, replace all pixels belonging to that object with the \n   background color (orange, 7).\n4. Otherwise, the object remains unchanged.\n5. Pixels that are initially the background color also remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid: np.ndarray, background_color: int) -> List[Set[Tuple[int, int]]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all connected objects of non-background pixels in the grid.\n    Connectivity includes diagonals.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            if grid[r, c] != background_color and not visited[r, c]:\n                # Start a Breadth-First Search (BFS) for a new object\n                current_object = set()\n                q = [(r, c)]\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                \n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.pop(0)\n                    current_object.add((row, col))\n\n                    # Check all 8 neighbors (including diagonals)\n                    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                                continue # Skip self\n\n                            nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n\n                            # Check bounds\n                            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                                # Check if neighbor is part of the object and not visited\n                                if grid[nr, nc] != background_color and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                                    visited[nr, nc] = True\n                                    q.append((nr, nc))\n                \n                if current_object:\n                    objects.append(current_object)\n                    \n    return objects\n\ndef is_surrounded(grid: np.ndarray, obj: Set[Tuple[int, int]], background_color: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if an object is completely surrounded by the background color or grid boundaries.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    \n    for r, c in obj:\n        # Check all 8 neighbors\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                    continue # Skip self\n                \n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n\n                # Check if neighbor is out of bounds\n                if not (0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width):\n                    return False # Touches boundary\n\n                # Check if neighbor is inside bounds but not background and not part of the object\n                if (nr, nc) not in obj and grid[nr, nc] != background_color:\n                    return False # Touches another object or non-background pixel\n                    \n    return True # All adjacent cells outside the object are background\n\ndef contains_color(grid: np.ndarray, obj: Set[Tuple[int, int]], target_color: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if any pixel within the object has the target color.\n    \"\"\"\n    for r, c in obj:\n        if grid[r, c] == target_color:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    Identifies objects containing white (0) and surrounded by orange (7),\n    and replaces them entirely with orange (7).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    height, width = grid_np.shape\n    \n    background_color = 7\n    target_indicator_color = 0\n\n    # Find all distinct objects (connected components of non-background pixels)\n    objects = find_objects(grid_np, background_color)\n\n    # Iterate through each found object\n    for obj in objects:\n        # Check Condition 1: Does the object contain the target indicator color (white, 0)?\n        has_target_color = contains_color(grid_np, obj, target_indicator_color)\n        \n        # Check Condition 2: Is the object completely surrounded by the background color (orange, 7)?\n        is_obj_surrounded = is_surrounded(grid_np, obj, background_color)\n        \n        # If both conditions are met, replace the object's pixels with the background color\n        if has_target_color and is_obj_surrounded:\n            for r, c in obj:\n                output_grid[r, c] = background_color\n\n    # Convert back to list of lists for the required output format\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
