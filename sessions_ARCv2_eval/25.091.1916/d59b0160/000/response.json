It fills most of the grid space and seems to replace removed elements.\n3.  **Objects:** There are distinct clusters or shapes formed by contiguous pixels (sharing sides or corners) of colors other than orange (7). These non-orange clusters can be considered \"objects\".\n4.  **Key Color for Change:** The white color (0) seems crucial. Objects containing white pixels are candidates for modification.\n5.  **Condition for Change:** Objects are removed (replaced by orange 7) only if they meet two conditions:\n    *   The object contains at least one white (0) pixel.\n    *   The object is completely surrounded by the background color (orange 7). This means no pixel belonging to the object touches the grid boundary or another non-orange pixel that is part of a *different* object.\n6.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying these specific objects (containing white and surrounded by orange) and replacing all their constituent pixels with the background color (orange 7). Objects that do not meet both conditions remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a connected component of pixels (adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) that are *not* the background color.\n4.  For each identified object:\n    a.  Check if any pixel within the object has the color white (0).\n    b.  Check if the object is entirely surrounded by the background color (orange 7). To do this, examine all pixels directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any pixel of the object. If all these adjacent pixels are either within the grid boundaries and have the background color (orange 7), then the object is considered surrounded. If any adjacent position is outside the grid or contains a non-background color pixel *not* belonging to the current object, it is *not* surrounded.\n    c.  If *both* conditions (contains white AND is surrounded by orange) are true for the object:\n        i.  Iterate through all pixels belonging to this object in the output grid.\n        ii. Replace the color of each of these pixels with the background color (orange 7).\n5.  Return the modified output grid."
