            "text": "**General Assessment & Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core components: a background color (orange 7), objects (non-orange connected components), a trigger color (white 0), and an action (replace object with background color). However, the code implementing the \"surrounded by background\" condition failed on all examples. The failures consistently involved objects near the boundaries or objects that should have been removed but weren't, or vice-versa.\n\nThe key error seems to be in the definition and implementation of the `is_surrounded` function. The original implementation incorrectly treated boundary adjacency, leading to incorrect decisions about which objects to remove.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine `is_surrounded`:** Modify the logic to explicitly check neighbors. An object is surrounded *only if* every adjacent pixel *outside* the object, but *inside* the grid boundaries, is the background color (orange 7). If any adjacent pixel is outside the grid boundary, the object is *not* surrounded.\n2.  **Verify other components:** Double-check `find_objects` (using 8-way connectivity) and `contains_color`. These seem correct based on the analysis, but careful verification is needed.\n3.  **Recalculate Metrics:** Use code execution to precisely quantify the mismatches in the previous run.\n4.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the corrected understanding of the \"surrounded\" condition.\n\n**Metrics from Previous Run**\n"
