Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** Large (30x30) grids primarily composed of white (0) background. They contain multiple distinct objects made of solid colors (1-9, excluding 5). There are also separate objects made of gray (5).
2.  **Colored Objects:** These objects vary in shape, size, and color across examples. Some inputs feature repeating patterns of colored objects (Example 2).
3.  **Gray Objects:** These appear distinct from the colored objects. In examples 1 and 3, they form shapes resembling numerical digits ('2' and '7', respectively). In example 2, there are two separate small gray shapes, one near the colored patterns and another ('L' shape) further away. These gray objects seem crucial as indicators or instructions.
4.  **Output Grid:** The output grids are significantly smaller than the inputs.
    *   In examples 1 and 3, the output grid depicts the *same digit* that was formed by the gray objects in the input, using the *color corresponding to that digit's value*. (Input gray '2' -> Output red '2'; Input gray '7' -> Output orange '7'). The dimensions and exact pixel pattern of the output digit vary.
    *   In example 2, the output is a 14x2 grid containing a vertical pattern using the colors (maroon-9, azure-8, yellow-4) that were prominent in the repeating patterns of the input grid. This output pattern appears related to, but not identical to, the repeating 2-column units in the input.

**YAML Fact Sheet:**

task_description: Determine the output grid based on instructions encoded by gray (5) objects in the input grid.

elements:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
  - element: colored_objects
    description: Contiguous blocks of pixels with colors 1-4, 6-9. Vary in shape, size, location. Can form patterns.
    attributes:
      - color
      - shape
      - position
      - size
  - element: gray_markers
    description: Contiguous blocks of pixels with gray color (5). Appear separate from colored objects. Encode instructions.
    attributes:
      - color: gray (5)
      - shape: Can resemble digits (e.g., '2', '7') or other forms (e.g., 'L', scattered points).
      - position
      - count: Number of separate gray objects/groups.
      - pixel_count: Total number of gray pixels.

relationships_actions:
  - type: encoding
    subject: gray_markers
    verb: represent
    object: instructions
    details: The shape/form of the gray markers determines the transformation rule.
  - type: selection_or_generation
    details: Based on the gray marker interpretation, either a specific digit shape is generated, or a pattern is selected/extracted from the input's colored objects.
  - type: color_mapping
    details: In the digit case, the value N of the digit represented by gray markers dictates the color C=N used in the output.
  - type: pattern_extraction
    details: In the non-digit case (Example 2), the gray markers seem to guide the extraction of a specific vertical pattern slice (e.g., 14x2) from the input's repeating colored patterns. The colors used in the output match those in the input pattern (9, 8, 4).

transformation_logic_cases:
  - case: Gray markers form a digit 'N'.
    input_condition: A contiguous group of gray pixels clearly represents a numerical digit N.
    action: Generate an output grid.
    output_properties:
      - shape: Represents the digit N.
      - color: Uses the color C corresponding to the digit's value (C=N).
      - size: Varies (e.g., 3x6 for '2', 17x3 for '7'). Determination unclear.
    examples: [train_1, train_3]
  - case: Gray markers do not form a digit.
    input_condition: Gray pixels form shapes not recognizable as digits (e.g., 'L', scattered points).
