**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implementation based on the first example produced incorrect results for both training examples. The core misunderstanding was the nature of the transformation: it's not simply propagation/copying of colors downwards, but rather a *movement* of specific colored pixels (Red, Yellow, Azure) step-by-step, where the pixel vacates its original position (which reverts to its original background color) and occupies a new position determined by color-specific rules, provided the target position is currently background. Static Green pixels act as obstacles. The process iterates until no more pixels can move.

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-analyze the examples focusing on the start and end positions of mobile pixels and the state of their original locations in the output.
2.  Confirm that Red (2) tries to move down, then down-left. Yellow (4) tries to move down, then down-right. Azure (8) tries to move *both* down-left and down-right in each step.
3.  Verify that movement only occurs into cells that are currently background (Blue=1 or White=0).
4.  Confirm that when a pixel moves, its original cell reverts to the background color it had in the *initial* input grid.
5.  Implement an iterative simulation where, in each step, all potential valid moves are identified based on the current grid state. Then, these moves are executed simultaneously (handling conflicts where multiple pixels target the same cell), updating the grid for the next iteration. The original position is cleared *after* the move is confirmed.
6.  Use a stable iteration approach (e.g., calculating all moves based on state N, then applying them to create state N+1) to avoid cascading effects within a single iteration.
7.  Address conflicts: If multiple pixels attempt to move into the same target cell in one iteration step, a consistent rule is needed. Processing pixels row-by-row (top-down) provides a natural priority, potentially resolving conflicts implicitly. A pixel attempting to move into a cell already claimed by a higher-priority pixel in the same step will fail.
