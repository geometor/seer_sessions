**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels.
2.  **Background Pattern:** A prominent checkerboard pattern using blue (1) and white (0) pixels forms the background in the input grids.
3.  **Foreground Objects/Pixels:** Other colors (green=3, azure=8, red=2, yellow=4) appear as individual pixels or small clusters on top of the checkerboard background.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the movement or propagation of certain foreground colors downwards, while others remain static. The background pattern is overwritten by the moving colors along their paths.
5.  **Color-Specific Behavior:**
    *   Green (3) pixels are static obstacles; they do not move and are not overwritten.
    *   Red (2) pixels move/propagate downwards. If directly below is blocked (or not background), they try to move/propagate down-left.
    *   Yellow (4) pixels move/propagate downwards. If directly below is blocked (or not background), they try to move/propagate down-right.
    *   Azure (8) pixels propagate simultaneously down-left and down-right.
6.  **Propagation Rule:** The moving/propagating pixels only overwrite cells that were originally part of the blue/white checkerboard background. They stop when they hit the grid boundary, a static green pixel, or a cell already occupied by another propagated pixel from the same or a different source.
7.  **Iteration:** The propagation process seems iterative, continuing until all mobile pixels have reached a stable position (boundary, obstacle, or occupied cell).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: variable height and width
    - background: checkerboard pattern of blue (1) and white (0)
    - foreground_pixels: scattered pixels of other colors (green, red, yellow, azure)

Pixels:
  Types:
    - Background: [blue (1), white (0)]
    - Static: [green (3)]
      - Properties: remains in original position, acts as an obstacle
    - Mobile/Propagating: [red (2), yellow (4), azure (8)]
      - Properties: propagates downwards, overwrites background pixels

Actions:
  - Propagation:
    - Condition: Applies to Mobile pixels (red, yellow, azure).
    - Trigger: A pixel of a mobile color exists at cell (r, c).
    - Rule: The pixel's color potentially propagates to adjacent cells in the row below (r+1).
    - Target_Condition: Propagation only occurs into cells that were originally background pixels (blue or white) in the input grid.
    - Color_Rules:
      - Red (2):
        - Tries (r+1, c).
        - If blocked or non-background, tries (r+1, c-1).
        - Paints target cell red (2) if propagation successful.
      - Yellow (4):
        - Tries (r+1, c).
        - If blocked or non-background, tries (r+1, c+1).
        - Paints target cell yellow (4) if propagation successful.
      - Azure (8):
        - Tries (r+1, c-1). Paints target cell azure (8) if successful.
        - Tries (r+1, c+1). Paints target cell azure (8) if successful. (These happen independently/simultaneously based on the source pixel at (r, c)).
    - Iteration: The propagation process repeats until no more pixels can propagate in a full pass over the grid.

Output_Grid:
  - Starts as a copy of the input grid.
  - Background pixels are potentially overwritten by propagating colors.
  - Static (green) pixels remain unchanged.
  - Final state reflects the settled positions of all propagated colors.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Create a static reference copy of the input grid to remember the original state, especially which cells were background (blue or white).
3.  Repeatedly iterate through the output grid until a full pass results in no changes:
    a.  For each row `r` from 0 to height-2 (iterate top-down):
    b.  For each column `c` from 0 to width-1:
    c.  Examine the pixel color `P` at `output[r, c]`.
    d.  **If `P` is Red (2):**
        i.  Check the cell directly below: `target = (r+1, c)`. If `target` is within grid bounds AND the corresponding cell in the *reference input grid* is background (blue or white), change `output[target]` to Red (2).
        ii. Else (if straight down is blocked or invalid), check the cell down-left: `target = (r+1, c-1)`. If `target` is within grid bounds AND the corresponding cell in the *reference input grid* is background (blue or white), change `output[target]` to Red (2).
    e.  **If `P` is Yellow (4):**
        i.  Check the cell directly below: `target = (r+1, c)`. If `target` is within grid bounds AND the corresponding cell in the *reference input grid* is background (blue or white), change `output[target]` to Yellow (4).
        ii. Else (if straight down is blocked or invalid), check the cell down-right: `target = (r+1, c+1)`. If `target` is within grid bounds AND the corresponding cell in the *reference input grid* is background (blue or white), change `output[target]` to Yellow (4).
    f.  **If `P` is Azure (8):**
        i.  Check the cell down-left: `target_left = (r+1, c-1)`. If `target_left` is within grid bounds AND the corresponding cell in the *reference input grid* is background (blue or white), change `output[target_left]` to Azure (8).
        ii. Check the cell down-right: `target_right = (r+1, c+1)`. If `target_right` is within grid bounds AND the corresponding cell in the *reference input grid* is background (blue or white), change `output[target_right]` to Azure (8). (Note: Both checks are performed independently based on the state of `output[r, c]`).
4.  Once an iteration completes with no changes made to the output grid, the process is finished. Return the final output grid.
```python

"""
Transforms an input grid based on color-specific propagation rules over a checkerboard background.

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify background pixels (blue=1, white=0) from the original input grid.
3.  Repeatedly iterate through the grid until no pixels can propagate further in a full pass:
    a.  Create a temporary grid for the next state based on the current state.
    b.  For each pixel in the current grid:
        i.  If the pixel is Red (2):
            - Try to propagate Red to the cell directly below (r+1, c).
            - If the target cell is within bounds, was originally background, and is currently background in the next state grid, change it to Red in the next state grid.
            - If propagation straight down fails, try propagating Red to the cell down-left (r+1, c-1) under the same conditions.
        ii. If the pixel is Yellow (4):
            - Try to propagate Yellow to the cell directly below (r+1, c).
            - If the target cell is within bounds, was originally background, and is currently background in the next state grid, change it to Yellow in the next state grid.
            - If propagation straight down fails, try propagating Yellow to the cell down-right (r+1, c+1) under the same conditions.
        iii. If the pixel is Azure (8):
            - Try to propagate Azure to the cell down-left (r+1, c-1). If the target cell is within bounds, was originally background, and is currently background in the next state grid, change it to Azure in the next state grid.
            - Try to propagate Azure to the cell down-right (r+1, c+1). If the target cell is within bounds, was originally background, and is currently background in the next state grid, change it to Azure in the next state grid. (These are independent attempts).
    c.  Update the main grid with the next state.
    d.  If no changes were made in this pass, terminate the iteration.
4.  Return the final grid state. Green (3) pixels are static and act as blockers but are never overwritten.

"""
Simulates the movement of colored pixels on a grid based on specific rules.

The grid contains a background checkerboard pattern (blue=1, white=0) and foreground pixels of different colors.
Green (3) pixels are static obstacles.
Red (2), Yellow (4), and Azure (8) pixels are mobile.
The simulation proceeds in discrete steps until no pixels can move.

Rules per step:
1.  Identify all mobile pixels in the current grid state.
2.  For each mobile pixel, determine its potential next position(s) based on its color:
    - Red (2): Tries to move one step down. If the cell below is blocked (out of bounds, not background, or already claimed in this step), it tries to move one step down-left.
    - Yellow (4): Tries to move one step down. If the cell below is blocked, it tries to move one step down-right.
    - Azure (8): Tries to move *both* one step down-left and one step down-right simultaneously. Each potential move is evaluated independently.
3.  A move is valid only if the target cell is within grid bounds, contains a background color (0 or 1) in the *current* grid state, and has not already been claimed by another pixel moving in the *same* step.
4.  Conflicts for the same target cell are resolved by prioritizing the pixel encountered first during a top-down, left-right scan of the grid.
5.  All valid moves are determined based on the grid state at the beginning of the step.
6.  After identifying all valid moves for the step:
    - Create the next grid state.
    - Place the moved pixels in their new target cells.
    - For each pixel that successfully moved, clear its original cell by restoring the background color (0 or 1) from the initial input grid. An Azure pixel's original cell is cleared if at least one of its potential moves (down-left or down-right) was successful.
7.  Repeat steps 1-6 until a step occurs where no pixels move.
8.  Return the final grid state.

**General Assessment:**

The provided code (`code_00.py` which implements the second, "movement" based strategy) significantly deviates from the expected outputs for both training examples. The transformed outputs show excessive propagation/filling, ignoring the structure, obstacles (green pixels), and the rule that propagation should only overwrite original background pixels. The core issue seems to be a misinterpretation of the transformation as "pixel movement" (where the source pixel moves and its original location is cleared) instead of "pixel propagation" or "painting" (where the source pixel remains and its color spreads downwards iteratively under specific conditions).

The original natural language program and YAML seemed closer to the propagation concept, but the implementation failed. The error analysis suggests the propagation logic needs refinement, specifically regarding:
1.  **Iteration:** The process must repeat until a stable state is reached.
2.  **Target Condition:** Propagation should only color a target cell if that cell was *originally* background (blue/white) in the input AND is *currently* background in the grid being modified.
3.  **Source Persistence:** The original colored pixels initiating the propagation should remain in place.
4.  **Obstacles:** Green pixels block propagation and are not overwritten.

**Strategy:**

Revise the natural language program and subsequent code implementation to follow an iterative "painting" or "propagation" model. The simulation will proceed in steps, where each step attempts to propagate colors downwards based on the rules, until a step occurs where no grid cells change color. We will explicitly use the original input grid to check if a target cell was initially background and the current state of the output grid to see if it's available to be painted.

**Metrics Analysis:**

Let's use code execution to analyze the differences more formally for the failed `code_00.py`.
