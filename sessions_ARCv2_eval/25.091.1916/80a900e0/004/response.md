**General Assessment:**

The provided code (`code_00.py` which implements the second, "movement" based strategy) significantly deviates from the expected outputs for both training examples. The transformed outputs show excessive propagation/filling, ignoring the structure, obstacles (green pixels), and the rule that propagation should only overwrite original background pixels. The core issue seems to be a misinterpretation of the transformation as "pixel movement" (where the source pixel moves and its original location is cleared) instead of "pixel propagation" or "painting" (where the source pixel remains and its color spreads downwards iteratively under specific conditions).

The original natural language program and YAML seemed closer to the propagation concept, but the implementation failed. The error analysis suggests the propagation logic needs refinement, specifically regarding:
1.  **Iteration:** The process must repeat until a stable state is reached.
2.  **Target Condition:** Propagation should only color a target cell if that cell was *originally* background (blue/white) in the input AND is *currently* background in the grid being modified.
3.  **Source Persistence:** The original colored pixels initiating the propagation should remain in place.
4.  **Obstacles:** Green pixels block propagation and are not overwritten.

**Strategy:**

Revise the natural language program and subsequent code implementation to follow an iterative "painting" or "propagation" model. The simulation will proceed in steps, where each step attempts to propagate colors downwards based on the rules, until a step occurs where no grid cells change color. We will explicitly use the original input grid to check if a target cell was initially background and the current state of the output grid to see if it's available to be painted.

**Metrics Analysis:**

Let's use code execution to analyze the differences more formally for the failed `code_00.py`.
