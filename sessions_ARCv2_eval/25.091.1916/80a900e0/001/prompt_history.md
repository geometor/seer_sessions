**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels.
2.  **Background Pattern:** A prominent checkerboard pattern using blue (1) and white (0) pixels forms the background in the input grids.
3.  **Foreground Objects/Pixels:** Other colors (green=3, azure=8, red=2, yellow=4) appear as individual pixels or small clusters on top of the checkerboard background.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the movement or propagation of certain foreground colors downwards, while others remain static. The background pattern is overwritten by the moving colors along their paths.
5.  **Color-Specific Behavior:**
    *   Green (3) pixels are static obstacles; they do not move and are not overwritten.
    *   Red (2) pixels move/propagate downwards. If directly below is blocked (or not background), they try to move/propagate down-left.
    *   Yellow (4) pixels move/propagate downwards. If directly below is blocked (or not background), they try to move/propagate down-right.
    *   Azure (8) pixels propagate simultaneously down-left and down-right.
6.  **Propagation Rule:** The moving/propagating pixels only overwrite cells that were originally part of the blue/white checkerboard background. They stop when they hit the grid boundary, a static green pixel, or a cell already occupied by another propagated pixel from the same or a different source.
7.  **Iteration:** The propagation process seems iterative, continuing until all mobile pixels have reached a stable position (boundary, obstacle, or occupied cell).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: variable height and width
    - background: checkerboard pattern of blue (1) and white (0)
    - foreground_pixels: scattered pixels of other colors (green, red, yellow, azure)

Pixels:
  Types:
    - Background: [blue (1), white (0)]
    - Static: [green (3)]
      - Properties: remains in original position, acts as an obstacle
    - Mobile/Propagating: [red (2), yellow (4), azure (8)]
      - Properties: propagates downwards, overwrites background pixels

Actions:
  - Propagation:
    - Condition: Applies to Mobile pixels (red, yellow, azure).
    - Trigger: A pixel of a mobile color exists at cell (r, c).
    - Rule: The pixel's color potentially propagates to adjacent cells in the row below (r+1).
    - Target_Condition: Propagation only occurs into cells that were originally background pixels (blue or white) in the input grid.
    - Color_Rules:
      - Red (2):
        - Tries (r+1, c).
        - If blocked or non-background, tries (r+1, c-1).
        - Paints target cell red (2) if propagation successful.
      - Yellow (4):
        - Tries (r+1, c).
        - If blocked or non-background, tries (r+1, c+1).
        - Paints target cell yellow (4) if propagation successful.
      - Azure (8):
        - Tries (r+1, c-1). Paints target cell azure (8) if successful.
        - Tries (r+1, c+1). Paints target cell azure (8) if successful. (These happen independently/simultaneously based on the source pixel at (r, c)).
    - Iteration: The propagation process repeats until no more pixels can propagate in a full pass over the grid.

Output_Grid:
  - Starts as a copy of the input grid.
  - Background pixels are potentially overwritten by propagating colors.
  - Static (green) pixels remain unchanged.
  - Final state reflects the settled positions of all propagated colors.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Create a static reference copy of the input grid to remember the original state, especially which cells were background (blue or white).
3.  Repeatedly iterate through the output grid until a full pass results in no changes:
    a.  For each row `r` from 0 to height-2 (iterate top-down):
    b.  For each column `c` from 0 to width-1:
    c.  Examine the pixel color `P` at `output[r, c]`.
    d.  **If `P` is Red (2):**
        i.  Check the cell directly below: `target = (r+1, c)`. If `target` is within grid bounds AND the corresponding cell in the *reference input grid* is background (blue or white), change `output[target]` to Red (2).
        ii. Else (if straight down is blocked or invalid), check the cell down-left: `target = (r+1, c-1)`. If `target` is within grid bounds AND the corresponding cell in the *reference input grid* is background (blue or white), change `output[target]` to Red (2).
    e.  **If `P` is Yellow (4):**
        i.  Check the cell directly below: `target = (r+1, c)`. If `target` is within grid bounds AND the corresponding cell in the *reference input grid* is background (blue or white), change `output[target]` to Yellow (4).
        ii. Else (if straight down is blocked or invalid), check the cell down-right: `target = (r+1, c+1)`. If `target` is within grid bounds AND the corresponding cell in the *reference input grid* is background (blue or white), change `output[target]` to Yellow (4).
    f.  **If `P` is Azure (8):**
        i.  Check the cell down-left: `target_left = (r+1, c-1)`. If `target_left` is within grid bounds AND the corresponding cell in the *reference input grid* is background (blue or white), change `output[target_left]` to Azure (8).
        ii. Check the cell down-right: `target_right = (r+1, c+1)`. If `target_right` is within grid bounds AND the corresponding cell in the *reference input grid* is background (blue or white), change `output[target_right]` to Azure (8). (Note: Both checks are performed independently based on the state of `output[r, c]`).
4.  Once an iteration completes with no changes made to the output grid, the process is finished. Return the final output grid.
