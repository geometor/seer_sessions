Transformation rule:
1. Find the largest rectangular region in the input grid composed solely of white (0) pixels (the 'white box').
2. Determine the dimensions (height H, width W) and top-left corner (r0, c0) of this white box.
3. Create an output grid of size H x W, initialized entirely with white (0) pixels.
4. Identify all non-white 'marker' pixels located within the bounds of the white box in the input grid. Store each unique pair of (marker_color, relative_row), where relative_row is the marker's row index minus r0.
5. For each unique marker_color found inside the white box:
   a. Count the number of distinct, 8-way connected components (objects) of that same color located entirely *outside* the white box in the input grid.
6. For each unique (marker_color, relative_row) pair identified in step 4:
   a. Retrieve the count of external objects for marker_color calculated in step 5.
   b. In the output grid, on the 'relative_row', place pixels of 'marker_color' at column indices 1, 3, 5, ..., up to the number of external objects counted.
   c. Stop placing pixels for this row/color if the calculated column index (2*k - 1) is greater than or equal to the output grid's width (W).
7. Return the final output grid.
