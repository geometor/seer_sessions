The primary failure was likely due to library unavailability (`skimage`) or potential bugs in the custom implementations of `find_largest_rectangle` and `find_connected_components`.\n\nThe strategy moving forward is:\n\n1.  **Refine Algorithms:** Implement robust, dependency-free versions of `find_largest_rectangle` and `find_connected_components` (using BFS/DFS).\n2.  **Clarify Rules:** Ensure the definitions of \"inside the white rectangle,\" \"external object,\" and \"connected components\" (8-way) are precise. Confirm that the count of external objects is *per color*, and this count is applied to *all* rows marked by that color.\n3.  **Verify with Metrics:** Use code execution to extract key details from each example to confirm assumptions about rectangle size, marker locations, object counts, and output structure.\n\n## Metrics Extraction\n\nLet's extract metrics for each training example to solidify our understanding.\n\n"
