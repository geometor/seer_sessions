Rows with even indices (0, 2, 4...) often consist of gray (8) pixels, sometimes with green (3) pixels at the horizontal edges. Rows with odd indices (1, 3, 5...) consist mostly of white (0) background pixels, interspersed with distinct objects.\n2.  **Objects:** The key objects in the input grids are horizontal rectangles of size 1x3, composed entirely of orange (7) pixels. These orange rectangles appear only within the white background rows (odd indices).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves these orange rectangles.\n    *   The orange rectangles themselves are replaced in the output.\n    *   New magenta (6) pixels appear in the output grid.\n4.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   Each 1x3 orange rectangle is identified.\n    *   The location of the middle pixel of this orange rectangle is crucial.\n    *   The orange rectangle is replaced: the left and right orange pixels become gray (8), and the middle orange pixel becomes magenta (6).\n    *   The pixels directly above and directly below the *middle* pixel of the original orange rectangle are changed to magenta (6), regardless of their original color.\n5.  **Background/Other Elements:** Most other pixels retain their original colors from the input to the output. There are some instances where gray (8) pixels adjacent to green (3) pixels turn green (3) in the output, but this pattern is not perfectly consistent across all examples or locations and seems secondary to the main orange-related transformation. The primary, consistent rule governs the orange rectangles and their vertical neighbors.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
