            "text": "**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation involves modifying specific regions of the input grid while removing others.\n2.  **Background:** Each example has a dominant background color (white=1 in ex1, azure=8 in ex2, yellow=4 in ex3) which remains largely the same in the output, except where objects are removed or modified.\n3.  **Framed Rectangles:** The most salient features are large rectangles defined by a single-pixel-thick frame of one color (FrameColor) surrounding a solid rectangular area of another color (FillColor). These structures persist in the output, but their FillColor area is modified.\n4.  **Small Objects:** The input grids also contain smaller, distinct objects located separately from the large framed rectangles, often near the top. These small objects are *removed* in the output, replaced by the background color.\n5.  **Modification Rule:** The core transformation happens within the FillColor area of the large framed rectangles. A specific letter-like shape ('H', 'E', or 'L') is \"drawn\" inside this area using the FrameColor.\n6.  **Shape Determination:** The specific letter drawn ('H', 'E', 'L') appears to be determined by a relationship between the large framed rectangle and one of the small objects that were removed. Specifically, the small object whose primary color matches the *fill color* of the large rectangle seems to dictate which letter is drawn.\n7.  **Shape Placement:** The letters ('H', 'E', 'L') are consistently 5 pixels high and 3 pixels wide. They are drawn starting 1 pixel down and 1 pixel right from the top-left corner of the FillColor area.\n8.  **Special Case ('L'):** In `train_1`, when the letter 'L' is drawn (in the Azure fill area), a second, horizontally mirrored 'L' is drawn immediately to its right, separated by a 1-pixel gap. This seems linked to the specific small object (the Azure square) that corresponded to this rectangle.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
