Transformation rule:
1. Identify the background color (most frequent color overall).
2. Find large rectangular regions defined by a 1-pixel frame of one color (FrameColor) surrounding a solid area of another color (FillColor).
3. Find all other distinct 'small objects' that are not background and not part of the large framed rectangles.
4. Classify each small object based on its shape, size, and color pattern (e.g., "Red frame, Azure center", "Solid Green cross"). There's a predefined mapping from these classifications to letter shapes ('H', 'E', 'L') and a flag indicating if a mirrored version should also be drawn (specifically for 'L' derived from a 2x2 solid Azure square).
5. Create the output grid, initially filled with the background color.
6. For each large framed rectangle found:
    a. Copy its frame (using FrameColor) to the output grid.
    b. Fill the area inside the frame on the output grid with its original FillColor.
    c. Find the small object whose properties (frame color, solid color, or center color) match the FillColor of the large rectangle.
    d. Based on the classification of the matched small object, determine the letter ('H', 'E', 'L') and mirrored flag.
    e. Draw the determined letter pattern inside the filled area on the output grid, starting 1 pixel down and 1 pixel right from the top-left corner of the FillColor area. Use the FrameColor for drawing the letter.
    f. If the mirrored flag is set, draw a horizontally mirrored version of the letter ('L' only in examples) immediately to the right of the first letter, separated by a 1-pixel gap, also using FrameColor.
7. Small objects identified in step 3 are effectively removed as they are not copied to the output grid.
