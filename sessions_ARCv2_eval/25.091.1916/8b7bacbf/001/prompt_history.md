## Perception

The task involves modifying an input grid based on color patterns. The core operation seems to be identifying specific 2x2 blocks of white pixels and filling them with a special color found elsewhere in the grid.

1.  **Identify the Fill Color:** In each example, there's exactly one pixel whose color is unique across the entire grid (appears only once). This unique color serves as the "fill color" for the transformation. In the examples, orange (7) and yellow (4) were the fill colors.
2.  **Identify Target Squares:** The transformation targets 2x2 squares composed entirely of white pixels (0).
3.  **Identify Frame Colors:** Certain colors seem to act as "frames" or "triggers" for the fill operation. These frame colors surround the target 2x2 white squares. Based on the examples, red (2), green (3), and gray (5) act as frame colors. White (0), blue (1), and the unique fill color itself do *not* act as frame colors.
4.  **Apply Fill Condition:** A 2x2 square of white pixels is filled with the unique fill color if it is "sufficiently bordered" by pixels of the frame colors. Specifically, if at least three of the eight neighboring cells surrounding the 2x2 white square are of a valid frame color.
5.  **Output:** The output grid is the input grid modified by filling the qualifying 2x2 white squares with the unique fill color. The original frame pixels and the unique fill color pixel remain unchanged. Other parts of the grid also remain unchanged.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input grid and count the occurrences of each color (excluding white, color 0).
2.  Identify the color that appears exactly once; this is the `fill_color`. If no color appears exactly once, the transformation might not apply or the rule is different (though all examples show a unique color).
3.  Define a set of `frame_colors` which includes all colors present in the input grid except for white (0), blue (1), and the identified `fill_color`.
4.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
5.  Iterate through the grid, examining every possible 2x2 square. For a grid of height H and width W, check top-left corners (r, c) where `0 <= r < H-1` and `0 <= c < W-1`.
6.  For each potential top-left corner (r, c), check if the 2x2 square defined by `(r, c), (r+1, c), (r, c+1), (r+1, c+1)` consists entirely of white (0) pixels in the *input* grid.
7.  If it is a 2x2 white square, examine its 8 neighboring pixels in the *input* grid (cells `(r-1, c-1)` through `(r+2, c+2)`, excluding the square itself, and respecting grid boundaries).
8.  Count how many of these 8 neighbors have a color that is included in the `frame_colors` set.
9.  If this count is 3 or greater, modify the *output* grid by setting the color of the four pixels `(r, c), (r+1, c), (r, c+1), (r+1, c+1)` to the `fill_color`.
10. After checking all possible 2x2 squares, return the modified output grid.
