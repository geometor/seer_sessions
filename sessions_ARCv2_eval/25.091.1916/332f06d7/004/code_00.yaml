task_elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - height: H (integer between 1 and 30)
      - width: W (integer between 1 and 30)
      - pixels: colored cells with values 0-9
  - element: pixel_color_white
    value: 0
    transformation: changes to Blue(1)
    condition: always, regardless of grid size
  - element: pixel_color_red
    value: 2
    transformation: changes to White(0)
    condition: grid is small (H < 14 AND W < 14)
  - element: pixel_color_red
    value: 2
    transformation: remains Red(2) (unchanged)
    condition: grid is large (H >= 14 OR W >= 14)
  - element: pixel_color_blue
    value: 1
    transformation: remains Blue(1) (unchanged)
    condition: grid is small (H < 14 AND W < 14)
  - element: pixel_color_blue
    value: 1
    transformation: changes to White(0)
    condition: grid is large (H >= 14 OR W >= 14) AND all 8 neighbors are either Blue(1) or Green(3)
  - element: pixel_color_blue
    value: 1
    transformation: remains Blue(1) (unchanged)
    condition: grid is large (H >= 14 OR W >= 14) AND at least one neighbor is NOT Blue(1) and NOT Green(3)
  - element: other_pixel_colors
    value: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
    transformation: remain unchanged
    condition: always
relationships:
  - The transformation logic depends entirely on a grid size check: (Height < 14 AND Width < 14).
  - Two distinct sets of rules apply based on whether the grid is 'small' or 'large'.
  - White(0) pixels are always transformed to Blue(1).
  - Red(2) pixels are transformed only in small grids.
  - Blue(1) pixels are transformed (conditionally based on neighbors) only in large grids.
  - Green(3) acts as a contextual color for the Blue(1) transformation in large grids but is otherwise unchanged.
