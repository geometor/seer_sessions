"""
Transforms the input grid based on pixel color and grid dimensions.
The transformation rules depend on whether the grid is "small" (both height H and width W < 14) or "large" (H >= 14 or W >= 14).

Rule Overview:
1. White(0) pixels always change to Blue(1). This is applied first.
2. If the grid is small (H < 14 AND W < 14):
   - After step 1, Red(2) pixels change to White(0).
   - Other colors (including Blue(1)) remain unchanged.
3. If the grid is large (H >= 14 OR W >= 14):
   - After step 1, identify solid rectangular blocks composed entirely of Blue(1) pixels in the *original* input grid.
   - For each such Blue(1) rectangle, check if all cells immediately neighboring its perimeter (including diagonals) in the *original* input grid are either Blue(1) or Green(3).
   - If the neighbor condition is met for a Blue(1) rectangle, change all pixels within that rectangle in the *output grid* to White(0).
   - Other colors (including Red(2)) remain unchanged in large grids, except for the transformations in step 1 and the Blue(1) rectangle rule.
