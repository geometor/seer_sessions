"""
Transforms the input grid based on pixel color and grid dimensions.

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new grid (output_grid) as a copy of the input grid.
3.  Evaluate the condition: Is H less than 14 AND W less than 14?
4.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid at position (row, column):
    a.  Get the color value `C` of the input cell.
    b.  If `C` is 0 (white), set the corresponding cell in the output_grid to 1 (blue).
    c.  Else if `C` is 2 (red):
        i.  If the condition (H < 14 AND W < 14) is true, set the corresponding cell in the output_grid to 0 (white).
        ii. If the condition is false, the corresponding cell in output_grid remains 2 (red) (handled by initial copy).
    d.  Else (for any other color `C`), the corresponding cell in output_grid remains `C` (handled by initial copy).
5.  The output_grid is the final result.
