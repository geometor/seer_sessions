White pixels always change to blue (1). Red pixels change to white (0) only if a specific condition related to the grid's size is met. Other colors, like blue (1) and green (3), are present but remain unchanged and do not seem to directly influence the transformation rule, except potentially as context that was considered during analysis. The key insight is identifying that the grid dimensions act as the condition for the transformation of red pixels.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
