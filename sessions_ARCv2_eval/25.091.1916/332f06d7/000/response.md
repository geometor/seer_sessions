*   **Perception:** The task involves conditional color replacement based on the input grid's properties. The primary colors involved are red (2) and white (0). White pixels always change to blue (1). Red pixels change to white (0) only if a specific condition related to the grid's size is met. Other colors, like blue (1) and green (3), are present but remain unchanged and do not seem to directly influence the transformation rule, except potentially as context that was considered during analysis. The key insight is identifying that the grid dimensions act as the condition for the transformation of red pixels.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - element: grid
        properties:
          - height: integer between 1 and 30
          - width: integer between 1 and 30
          - pixels: colored cells with values 0-9
      - element: pixel_color_white
        value: 0
        transformation: changes to blue (1)
        condition: always
      - element: pixel_color_red
        value: 2
        transformation: changes to white (0)
        condition: depends on grid size
    conditions:
      - condition_name: grid_size_check
        property: grid dimensions (height H, width W)
        rule: (H < 14) AND (W < 14)
    relationships:
      - The transformation rule for red pixels (2) is gated by the grid_size_check condition.
      - If grid_size_check is true, red pixels change to white (0).
      - If grid_size_check is false, red pixels remain red (2).
      - The transformation rule for white pixels (0) is independent and always results in blue (1).
      - All other pixel colors remain unchanged.

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
    2.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    3.  Evaluate the condition: Is H less than 14 AND W less than 14?
    4.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid at position (row, column):
        a.  Get the color value `C` of the input cell.
        b.  If `C` is 0 (white), set the corresponding cell in the new grid to 1 (blue).
        c.  Else if `C` is 2 (red):
            i.  If the condition (H < 14 AND W < 14) is true, set the corresponding cell in the new grid to 0 (white).
            ii. If the condition is false, set the corresponding cell in the new grid to 2 (red).
        d.  Else (for any other color `C`), set the corresponding cell in the new grid to `C`.
    5.  The new grid is the output.
