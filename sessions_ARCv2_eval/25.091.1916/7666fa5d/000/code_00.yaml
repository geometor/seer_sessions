task_description: Draw straight lines between all pairs of non-background pixels.
background_color: 8 (azure)
objects:
  - type: feature_pixels
    description: Isolated pixels that are not the background color.
    color_in_example_1: 4 (yellow)
    color_in_example_2: 3 (green)
    count: Variable across examples and grids.
  - type: background
    description: The dominant color filling most of the grid.
    color: 8 (azure)
  - type: connecting_lines
    description: Pixels added in the output grid to connect pairs of feature pixels.
    color: 2 (red)
relationships:
  - type: pairwise_connection
    description: Every pair of feature pixels defines the start and end points for a potential connecting line.
actions:
  - action: identify_feature_pixels
    description: Locate all pixels in the input grid that are not the background color.
  - action: identify_pairs
    description: Generate all unique pairs from the identified feature pixels.
  - action: draw_lines
    description: For each pair of feature pixels, calculate the coordinates of the pixels forming a straight line between them.
    color_used: 2 (red)
    target_pixels: Only pixels that were originally background pixels (azure, 8) along the line path are changed.
    preservation: Original feature pixels are not overwritten by the connecting lines.
grid_properties:
  - size: Remains the same between input and output.
  - content: Input feature pixels are preserved in the output. Background pixels may be replaced by connecting line pixels.
