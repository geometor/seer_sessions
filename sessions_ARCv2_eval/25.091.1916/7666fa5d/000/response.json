            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids feature a dominant background color (azure, 8). Scattered across this background are individual pixels of a different, single color (yellow, 4 in the first example; green, 3 in the second). These non-background pixels appear somewhat sparse.\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grids retain the original background color and the original scattered pixels (yellow/green) in their exact input positions. Additionally, new pixels of red color (2) have been introduced.\n3.  **Transformation:** The red pixels appear to form straight lines (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) connecting pairs of the original scattered pixels (yellow/green). It seems that for every possible pair of the initial yellow/green pixels, a line is drawn between them using the red color.\n4.  **Line Drawing:** The lines are drawn *over* the background pixels (azure, 8). Importantly, the original yellow/green pixels are *not* overwritten, even if a line passes through their location. They remain unchanged. The red lines fill the space between the pairs.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
