*   **General Assessment:** The initial hypothesis correctly identified the two main transformation branches based on the count of Blue/Green shapes. The logic for the single-shape case (filling the Key Column) was correct and worked for Example 1. However, the logic for the multiple-shape case was incorrect. Instead of simply copying the shape pixels, the transformation involves calculating the convex hull of *all* Blue (1) and Green (3) pixels combined and filling this hull area with Red (2). The Key Column location is only relevant when there's exactly one shape.

*   **Strategy:** The plan is to refine the logic for the `num_shapes > 1` condition. This involves:
    1.  Collecting all coordinates of Blue (1) and Green (3) pixels across all shapes.
    2.  Calculating the convex hull of these points.
    3.  Identifying all grid cells that fall inside or on the boundary of this convex hull polygon.
    4.  Coloring these identified cells Red (2) in the output grid.
    5.  Handle the edge case where fewer than 3 points exist (no hull possible) by simply coloring the original Blue/Green pixels red.

*   **Metrics and Analysis:**
