The Green pixels often appear at corners or edges but seem functionally part of the Blue shapes. Let's call these \"Blue/Green shapes\". The number of these shapes varies across examples (1, 4, 3, 2).\n    *   There is always a single Yellow (4) pixel.\n    *   Directly below the Yellow pixel, there is a short vertical line of Red (2) pixels. This Yellow/Red structure appears consistently in one column. Let's call this the \"Key Column\".\n4.  **Output Elements:**\n    *   The output grids consist only of the background color (Azure, 8) and Red (2) pixels.\n    *   The Blue/Green shapes and the Yellow/Red key structure from the input are absent in the output.\n    *   Two distinct output patterns emerge based on the input:\n        *   In Example 1, where there's only *one* Blue/Green shape, the output is a solid Red vertical line filling the *entire* Key Column.\n        *   In Examples 2, 3, and 4, where there are *multiple* Blue/Green shapes, the output grid replicates the exact positions of *all* the input Blue/Green shapes, but colored Red (2) instead of Blue (1) or Green (3).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
