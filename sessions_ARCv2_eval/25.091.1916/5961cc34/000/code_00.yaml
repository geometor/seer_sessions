Task: Conditional Shape Transformation or Column Fill

Grid_Properties:
  - Background_Color: 8 (Azure)
  - Grid_Size_Preserved: True

Input_Objects:
  - Object: Key_Marker
    - Pixels:
        - Color: 4 (Yellow), Count: 1
        - Color: 2 (Red), Variable Count (>=1)
    - Properties:
        - Yellow pixel is unique.
        - Red pixels form a vertical line directly below the Yellow pixel.
    - Role: Defines the 'Key_Column'. Also involved in triggering the transformation.
  - Object: Shapes
    - Pixels:
        - Color: 1 (Blue)
        - Color: 3 (Green)
    - Properties:
        - Form connected components (objects).
        - Green pixels seem part of the Blue shapes structurally.
        - The number of distinct shapes varies (1 to many).
    - Role: These are the primary objects potentially transformed or counted.

Relationships_Actions:
  - Relationship: Key_Column_Definition
    - Element1: Key_Marker (Yellow pixel)
    - Element2: Grid Column
    - Description: The column containing the Yellow pixel (and the Red line below it) is the Key_Column.
  - Action: Count_Shapes
    - Target: Shapes (Blue/Green objects)
    - Description: Determine the number of distinct, disconnected Blue/Green shapes.
  - Action: Conditional_Transformation
    - Trigger: Count of Shapes
    - Condition_1: Count == 1
      - Result: Fill the entire Key_Column with Red (2) in the output grid. Set all other pixels to the Background_Color (8).
    - Condition_2: Count > 1
      - Result: For every pixel belonging to any Blue (1) or Green (3) shape in the input, color the corresponding pixel Red (2) in the output grid. Set all other pixels to the Background_Color (8).

Output_Objects:
  - Color: 2 (Red)
  - Represents: Either the Key_Column (if input shape count was 1) or the copied locations of input Shapes (if input shape count > 1).
  - Color: 8 (Azure)
  - Represents: Background filler.
