            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Each example consists of an input grid and a corresponding output grid. The grids vary in size across examples (12x12, 22x22, 16x16).\n2.  **Colors:** The grids use only two colors: white (0) as the background and azure (8) for the patterns.\n3.  **Initial State:** The input grid contains a small, initial pattern of azure pixels on a white background. The shapes differ in each example ('+', 'H', 'T').\n4.  **Transformation:** The output grid is generated by iteratively expanding the initial azure pattern according to a specific rule. The original azure pixels from the input remain azure in the output.\n5.  **Growth Rule:** The pattern grows based on the neighborhood of each pixel. Observing the examples, particularly the way white pixels turn azure, suggests a cellular automaton rule. A white pixel seems to turn azure only if it has a specific number of azure neighbors in the previous step. Comparing the input and output, and considering common cellular automaton rules, the rule appears to be:\n    *   An existing azure pixel (8) remains azure.\n    *   A white pixel (0) becomes azure (8) if it has exactly 3 azure neighbors (including diagonals) in the current state.\n    *   Otherwise, a white pixel remains white.\n    This is often referred to as the B3/S_all rule (Birth if 3 neighbors / Survive always).\n6.  **Iterations:** The rule is applied iteratively. The number of iterations seems related to the grid size. A plausible hypothesis is that the number of iterations is half the maximum dimension of the grid (height or width), rounded down.\n    *   Example 1 (12x12): `max(12, 12) // 2 = 6` iterations.\n    *   Example 2 (22x22): `max(22, 22) // 2 = 11` iterations.\n    *   Example 3 (16x16): `max(16, 16) // 2 = 8` iterations.\n7.  **Grid Boundaries:** The growth occurs within the boundaries of the original grid dimensions.\n\n**YAML Block of Facts:**\n\n"
