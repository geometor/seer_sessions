task_description: Apply a cellular automaton growth rule iteratively to an initial pattern.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_match: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - colors_used: [white (0), azure (8)]
  - background_color: white (0)
initial_pattern:
  - color: azure (8)
  - location: Contained within the input grid.
  - role: Serves as the seed for the growth process.
transformation_rule:
  type: Cellular Automaton
  rule_name: B2/S_all (Birth=2 neighbors, Survival=always) # Updated Rule
  details:
    - A white (0) cell becomes azure (8) in the next step if it has exactly 2 azure neighbors (including diagonals) in the current step. # Updated Condition
    - An azure (8) cell remains azure (8) in the next step.
    - All other white (0) cells remain white (0).
  iterations:
    dependency: Grid dimensions
    calculation: floor(max(grid_height, grid_width) / 2) # Kept the same for now
    application: The rule is applied iteratively for the calculated number of steps.
output_pattern:
  - color: azure (8)
  - generation: Result of applying the transformation rule for the specified iterations, starting from the initial pattern.
  - relation_to_input: Contains the initial azure pattern as a subset.
