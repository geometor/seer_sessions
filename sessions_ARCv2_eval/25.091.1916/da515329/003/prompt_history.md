Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Each example consists of an input grid and a corresponding output grid. The grids vary in size across examples (12x12, 22x22, 16x16).
2.  **Colors:** The grids use only two colors: white (0) as the background and azure (8) for the patterns.
3.  **Initial State:** The input grid contains a small, initial pattern of azure pixels on a white background. The shapes differ in each example ('+', 'H', 'T').
4.  **Transformation:** The output grid is generated by iteratively expanding the initial azure pattern according to a specific rule. The original azure pixels from the input remain azure in the output.
5.  **Growth Rule:** The pattern grows based on the neighborhood of each pixel. Observing the examples, particularly the way white pixels turn azure, suggests a cellular automaton rule. A white pixel seems to turn azure only if it has a specific number of azure neighbors in the previous step. Comparing the input and output, and considering common cellular automaton rules, the rule appears to be:
    *   An existing azure pixel (8) remains azure.
    *   A white pixel (0) becomes azure (8) if it has exactly 3 azure neighbors (including diagonals) in the current state.
    *   Otherwise, a white pixel remains white.
    This is often referred to as the B3/S_all rule (Birth if 3 neighbors / Survive always).
6.  **Iterations:** The rule is applied iteratively. The number of iterations seems related to the grid size. A plausible hypothesis is that the number of iterations is half the maximum dimension of the grid (height or width), rounded down.
    *   Example 1 (12x12): `max(12, 12) // 2 = 6` iterations.
    *   Example 2 (22x22): `max(22, 22) // 2 = 11` iterations.
    *   Example 3 (16x16): `max(16, 16) // 2 = 8` iterations.
7.  **Grid Boundaries:** The growth occurs within the boundaries of the original grid dimensions.

**YAML Block of Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Apply a cellular automaton growth rule iteratively to an initial pattern.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_match: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - colors_used: [white (0), azure (8)]
  - background_color: white (0)
initial_pattern:
  - color: azure (8)
  - location: Contained within the input grid.
  - role: Serves as the seed for the growth process.
transformation_rule:
  type: Cellular Automaton
  rule_name: B3/S_all (Birth=3 neighbors, Survival=always)
  details:
    - A white (0) cell becomes azure (8) in the next step if it has exactly 3 azure neighbors (including diagonals) in the current step.
    - An azure (8) cell remains azure (8) in the next step.
    - All other white (0) cells remain white (0).
  iterations:
    dependency: Grid dimensions
    calculation: floor(max(grid_height, grid_width) / 2)
    application: The rule is applied iteratively for the calculated number of steps.
output_pattern:
  - color: azure (8)
  - generation: Result of applying the transformation rule for the specified iterations, starting from the initial pattern.
  - relation_to_input: Contains the initial azure pattern as a subset.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Calculate the number of iterations `k = max(H, W) // 2`.
3.  Initialize the current grid state with the input grid.
4.  Repeat the following process `k` times:
    a.  Create a new grid, `next_grid`, of the same dimensions (H x W), initially copying the `current_grid`.
    b.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` from row `r=0` to `H-1` and column `c=0` to `W-1`.
    c.  If the cell `current_grid[r, c]` is white (0):
        i.  Count the number of azure (8) neighbors for the cell `(r, c)` in the `current_grid`. Consider all 8 neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal), staying within the grid boundaries.
        ii. If the count of azure neighbors is exactly 3, set the corresponding cell in the `next_grid` to azure (8): `next_grid[r, c] = 8`.
    d.  After checking all cells, update the `current_grid` to be the `next_grid`.
5.  The final state of the `current_grid` after `k` iterations is the output grid.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial hypothesis implementing the B3/S_all cellular automaton rule for `k = max(grid_height, grid_width) // 2` iterations failed. The code produced outputs identical to the inputs for examples 1 and 3, and only minor changes for example 2, indicating that the conditions for cell "birth" (white changing to azure) were rarely met under the B3 rule.

Further analysis using code execution confirmed that key white cells adjacent to the initial patterns in examples 1 and 3 only had 2 azure neighbors, not the required 3 for the B3 rule. This strongly suggests the B3 birth condition is incorrect.

The strategy is to revise the hypothesized cellular automaton rule. Given that the outputs show significant growth and density, a less restrictive birth condition seems likely. The "Seeds" rule (B2/S_all - Birth if 2 neighbors, Survival always) is a plausible candidate. We will test this rule while keeping the original iteration count logic (`k = max(H, W) // 2`), as there's no clear evidence yet to change it.

**Metrics and Analysis**

Code execution was used to verify the neighbor counts for specific white cells near the initial patterns in the input grids:



*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

def count_azure_neighbors(grid, r, c):
    height, width = grid.shape
    count = 0
    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:
            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:
                continue
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:
                if grid[nr, nc] == 8:
                    count += 1
    return count

# Example 1 Input
grid1 = np.array([
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
])

# Example 3 Input
grid3 = np.array([
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],

])

# Check neighbors for cell (3,4) in grid1 (White, expected to become Azure)
count1_3_4 = count_azure_neighbors(grid1, 3, 4)
# Check neighbors for cell (5,5) in grid3 (White, expected to become Azure)
count3_5_5 = count_azure_neighbors(grid3, 5, 5)

print(f'Grid 1, Cell (3,4) - Neighbors: {count1_3_4}')
print(f'Grid 3, Cell (5,5) - Neighbors: {count3_5_5}')
```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
Grid 1, Cell (3,4) - Neighbors: 2
Grid 3, Cell (5,5) - Neighbors: 2

```
*   **Example 1:** Cell (3, 4) is white in the input. The expected output shows it becomes azure. Code confirms it has exactly 2 azure neighbors in the input grid.
*   **Example 3:** Cell (5, 5) is white in the input. The expected output shows it becomes azure. Code confirms it has exactly 2 azure neighbors in the input grid.

This evidence strongly supports changing the birth rule from B3 (requires 3 neighbors) to B2 (requires 2 neighbors). The survival rule (S_all - azure cells always survive) seems consistent with the observations, as the initial patterns appear fully preserved within the outputs.

  - colors_used: [white (0), azure (8)]
  - background_color: white (0)

output_pattern:
  - color: azure (8)
  - generation: Result of applying the transformation rule for the specified iterations, starting from the initial pattern.
  - relation_to_input: Contains the initial azure pattern as a subset.
```


**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Calculate the number of iterations `k = max(H, W) // 2`.
3.  Initialize the `current_grid` state with the input grid.
4.  Repeat the following process `k` times:
    a.  Create a new grid, `next_grid`, of the same dimensions (H x W), initially copying the `current_grid`.
    b.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` from row `r=0` to `H-1` and column `c=0` to `W-1`.
    c.  If the cell `current_grid[r, c]` is white (0):
        i.  Count the number of azure (8) neighbors for the cell `(r, c)` in the `current_grid`. Consider all 8 neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal), staying within the grid boundaries.
        ii. If the count of azure neighbors is exactly 2, set the corresponding cell in the `next_grid` to azure (8): `next_grid[r, c] = 8`. *(Rule updated from 3 neighbors to 2)*
    d.  After checking all cells, update the `current_grid` to be the `next_grid`.
5.  The final state of the `current_grid` after `k` iterations is the output grid.
