Often, there's one prominent, larger pattern and potentially other smaller, isolated non-white pixels or groups scattered elsewhere.\n3.  **Transformation:** The output grid appears to be a cropped version of the input grid. The cropping focuses specifically on the largest connected \"object\" or pattern formed by non-white pixels. All surrounding white space and any smaller, disconnected non-white pixels or groups from the input are excluded from the output.\n4.  **Object Definition:** An \"object\" or \"component\" seems to be a group of connected non-white pixels. Connectivity includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal adjacency.\n5.  **Selection Criteria:** The core logic selects the *largest* connected component based on the number of pixels it contains.\n6.  **Cropping Mechanism:** The output grid's dimensions and content correspond exactly to the minimum bounding box enclosing the selected largest component in the input grid.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Consider pixels connected if they touch horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Each such group is a \"connected component\".\n2.  Count the number of pixels in each connected component found in step 1.\n3.  Identify the connected component that has the largest pixel count. This is the \"target component\".\n4.  Find the minimum and maximum row indices and the minimum and maximum column indices occupied by the pixels of the target component. These four values define the \"bounding box\".\n5.  Create the output grid by extracting the rectangular region from the input grid that corresponds exactly to the bounding box determined in step 4. The output grid will have dimensions (max_row - min_row + 1) by (max_col - min_col + 1)."
