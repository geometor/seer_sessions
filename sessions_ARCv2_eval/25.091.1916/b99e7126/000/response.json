Each 4x4 block consists of a 3x3 inner pattern surrounded by a 1-pixel border.\n2.  **Repeating Blocks:** The grid is tiled with these 4x4 blocks. The border color (separating the 3x3 patterns) is consistent within each grid (red in examples 1 & 2, blue in example 3).\n3.  **Pattern Types:** Within each grid, there are typically two distinct 3x3 patterns present:\n    *   A \"base\" or \"default\" pattern that appears most frequently.\n    *   One or more instances of a \"variant\" pattern.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the \"variant\" pattern influencing adjacent \"base\" patterns. Specifically, if a block containing the base pattern shares a side (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally) with a block containing the variant pattern in the *input* grid, that base pattern block is replaced by the variant pattern block in the *output* grid.\n5.  **Propagation:** This replacement seems to be a single-step process based on the initial configuration. Blocks that change from base to variant do not immediately trigger further changes in the same step.\n6.  **Invariance:** The border pixels remain unchanged throughout the transformation.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
