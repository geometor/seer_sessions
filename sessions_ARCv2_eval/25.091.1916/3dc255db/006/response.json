            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code, based on identifying pixels unreachable via white cells and applying transformations based on column frequency and centroids, failed on all training examples.\n\n*   **Example 1 Failure:** The code incorrectly identified almost all non-white pixels as \"enclosed\" because the definition (\"unreachable via white cells\") was too broad for this example's pattern. The expected output suggests a different mechanism entirely, possibly related to adjacency or local patterns, not large-scale enclosure.\n*   **Examples 2 & 3 Failure:** The code correctly identified the truly enclosed pixels (Maroon in Ex2, Orange in Ex3) using the \"unreachable via white cells\" method and correctly removed them. However, the logic for placing the *new* indicator pixels was flawed. While the centroid tie-breaker worked for Example 3, it failed for Example 2, which required adding indicators to multiple columns.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Enclosed Pixel Identification:** The \"unreachable via white cells\" method works for Examples 2 and 3. We will keep this but acknowledge it doesn't capture Example 1's logic.\n2.  **Refine Grouping:** Instead of grouping all unreachable pixels of a single color together globally, we need to group them based on connectivity *and* potentially the context of their specific enclosure. A promising approach (Hypothesis 3 from internal thought process)"
