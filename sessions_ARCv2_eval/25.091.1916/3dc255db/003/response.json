Identify Enclosed Pixels: For each non-white color C present in the grid, find all pixels of color C that are \"enclosed\". A pixel is considered enclosed if it cannot reach the boundary of the grid by moving only through white (0) pixels or pixels of the same color C. This is determined using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all boundary cells, propagating only through white cells. Any non-white cell *not* reached by this BFS is potentially enclosed. We then filter these potentially enclosed cells to find those specifically of color C.\n\n2. Remove Enclosed Pixels: Change the color of all identified enclosed pixels (for all colors) to white (0) in a copy of the input grid.\n\n3. Add Indicator Pixels: For each color C for which enclosed pixels were found and removed:\n    a. Collect the locations (row, column) of the removed pixels of color C.\n    b. Count the frequency of each column index among these locations.\n    c. Find the maximum frequency (the highest number of removed pixels in a single column).\n    d. Identify all column indices that have this maximum frequency.\n    e. Select the minimum (leftmost) column index among those identified in step 3d. Let this be `target_col`.\n    f. Count the number of unique row indices among the removed pixel locations for color C. Let this be `N`.\n    g. In the `target_col`, change the color of the top `N` pixels (rows 0 to N-1) to color C.\n\n4. Final Grid: The grid after performing steps 2 and 3 for all relevant colors is the final output. If no pixels are enclosed according to the definition in step 1, the output grid is identical to the input grid. This rule specifically addresses the pattern observed in Examples 2 and 3. Example 1 appears to follow a different logic not covered here.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_unreachable_non_white(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all non-white pixels that cannot reach the grid boundary via white cells.\n    Uses BFS starting from the boundary, propagating only through white cells (0).\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    reachable = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    q = deque()\n\n    # Add boundary white cells to the queue\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in [0, cols - 1]:\n            if not reachable[r, c] and grid[r, c] == 0:\n                q.append((r, c))\n                reachable[r, c] = True\n    for c in range(cols):\n        for r in [0, rows - 1]:\n             if not reachable[r, c] and grid[r, c] == 0:\n                q.append((r, c))\n                reachable[r, c] = True\n\n    # Perform BFS through white cells\n    while q:\n        r, c = q.popleft()\n\n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n\n            # Check bounds and if neighbor is white and not visited\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n               not reachable[nr, nc] and grid[nr, nc] == 0:\n                reachable[nr, nc] = True\n                q.append((nr, nc))\n\n    # Identify non-white pixels that were not reached\n    unreachable_locations = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and not reachable[r, c]:\n                unreachable_locations.append(((r, c), grid[r,c])) # Store location and color\n\n    return unreachable_locations\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the enclosure transformation rule to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # 1.
