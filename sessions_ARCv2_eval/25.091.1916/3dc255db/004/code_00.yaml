Task: Remove Enclosed Pixels by Group and Add Centroid-Based Indicators

Elements:
  - Grid: A 2D array of pixels (0-9). Background is white (0).
  - Pixels: Individual cells with color and location (row, col).
  - Unreachable Pixels: Non-white pixels unable to reach the grid boundary via only white (0) pixels.
  - Enclosed Group: A connected component (4-way adjacency) of Unreachable Pixels sharing the same color. Processed independently.
  - Removed Pixels: Pixels belonging to an Enclosed Group, changed to white (0).
  - Indicator Pixels: Pixels added at the top of the grid (rows 0 to N-1) in a specific column.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Cardinal (4-way) connection between pixels. Used for grouping.
  - Reachability (via White): Defines Unreachable Pixels based on BFS from boundary through white cells.
  - Grouping: Unreachable Pixels are partitioned by color and then by adjacency into Enclosed Groups.

Actions:
  - Find Unreachable: Identify all Unreachable Pixels.
  - Group Unreachable: Find connected components within Unreachable Pixels of the same color.
  - Process Group (for each Enclosed Group):
      1.  Store Locations: Record (row, col) for all pixels in the group.
      2.  Remove: Set corresponding pixels in the output grid to white (0).
      3.  Calculate Column Frequencies: Count group pixels per column.
      4.  Find Max Frequency: Determine the highest column frequency for the group.
      5.  Identify Max Frequency Columns: List columns achieving the max frequency.
      6.  Apply Tie-breaker (`target_col` selection):
          *   If only one max frequency column, select it.
          *   If multiple: Calculate the average column index (centroid) of the group's pixel locations. Select the column from the tied list closest to the centroid. If still tied (equidistant), select the leftmost (minimum index) tied column.
      7.  Count Unique Rows (`N`): Find the number of distinct row indices in the group's locations.
      8.  Add Indicators: Set pixels `(0..N-1, target_col)` in the output grid to the group's color.

Exclusions:
  - Example 1 follows a pattern distinct from this enclosure/indicator logic.

Properties:
  - Color: Pixel value (0-9).
  - Location: (row, column).
  - Frequency: Count per column within a group.
  - Centroid Column: Average column index of a group's pixels (used for tie-breaking).
