**Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code failed on all three examples. The core issue appears to be the definition and detection of "enclosed" pixels. The first attempt used a BFS that allowed travel through the color being checked, incorrectly marking pixels adjacent to white space as not enclosed. Furthermore, Example 1 seems to follow a fundamentally different transformation rule than Examples 2 and 3, as it involves adjacency and removal/placement based on proximity to other shapes rather than strict enclosure.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Enclosure Detection:** Modify the Breadth-First Search (BFS) to define reachability strictly through white (0) pixels starting from the grid boundary. Any non-white pixel not reached by this BFS is considered potentially enclosed.
2.  **Refine Target Column Selection:** The initial rule ("leftmost column with max count") worked for Example 2 but failed for Example 3. The analysis suggests the correct rule is likely the *median* column among those columns containing the maximum number of enclosed pixels of a given color. If there's an even number of such columns, the lower median (floor of the average index) should be chosen.
3.  **Isolate Example 1 Logic:** Since the revised enclosure/median-column logic correctly identifies *no* enclosed pixels in Example 1 (as observed by running the analysis locally), it confirms Example 1 requires a separate rule. For this iteration, we will focus on correctly implementing the enclosure rule derived from Examples 2 and 3. The code should correctly process Examples 2 and 3 and leave Example 1 unchanged (which is still incorrect compared to the target output, but correctly reflects the *absence* of the enclosure condition). A complete solution would require identifying and implementing the rule for Example 1, possibly as a conditional check before or after the enclosure check.
4.  **Gather Metrics:** Use code execution to verify the refined enclosure definition and the median column selection rule against Examples 2 and 3.
