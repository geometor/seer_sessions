Task: Color Fill based on Enclosure

Elements:
  - Grid: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors (0-9). Background is white (0).
  - Objects: Contiguous regions of non-white pixels.
  - Enclosing Object: An object whose pixels form a boundary completely surrounding pixels of a different non-white color.
  - Enclosed Pixels: Non-white pixels located within the boundary of an Enclosing Object of a different color.
  - Enclosed Color: The color of the Enclosed Pixels.

Relationships:
  - Enclosure: An Enclosing Object spatially surrounds Enclosed Pixels. A pixel is enclosed if any path from it to the grid boundary must cross a pixel of the Enclosing Object.

Actions:
  - Identify Enclosures: Find all pairs of (Enclosing Object, Enclosed Pixels of a specific Enclosed Color).
  - Remove: Change the color of all identified Enclosed Pixels to white (0).
  - Analyze Columns: For each Enclosed Color removed:
      - Count how many pixels were removed in each column.
      - Find the maximum count.
      - Identify the column index(es) with the maximum count.
      - Select the minimum (leftmost) column index among those with the maximum count.
  - Analyze Rows: For each Enclosed Color removed:
      - Count the number of unique row indices (`N`) from which pixels were removed.
  - Add: In the selected column, change the color of the top `N` pixels (rows 0 to N-1) to the Enclosed Color.

Properties:
  - Color: The integer value (0-9) of a pixel.
  - Location: The (row, column) index of a pixel.
  - Shape: The configuration of pixels forming an object.
  - Connectivity: Pixels are connected cardinally (up, down, left, right). (Note: Flood fill for enclosure might need to consider diagonals or just ensure no path to edge exists).

Rule Focus: The transformation primarily targets pixels enclosed by objects of a different color, as seen consistently in examples 2 and 3. Example 1's behavior seems different and is not covered by this primary rule.
