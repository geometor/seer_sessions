In the output, green color expands from this seed.\n    *   Blue (1) and Red (2): These colors appear together in the input, often forming lines or patterns. They seem to define boundaries or barriers. In the output, all blue pixels associated with these boundary objects are changed to red.\n3.  **Transformation Core Logic:** The core transformation involves a \"flood fill\" or \"growth\" process originating from the single green pixel. This fill spreads through the azure background pixels.\n4.  **Barriers:** The objects initially containing blue and red pixels act as barriers to the green fill. Once the blue pixels within these objects are turned red, the entire object (now solid red) blocks the spread of the green color.\n5.  **Fill Termination:** The green fill stops when it encounters a red pixel (original or converted) or reaches the edge of the grid.\n6.  **Connectivity:** The fill appears to spread horizontally and vertically (4-connectivity), not diagonally.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
