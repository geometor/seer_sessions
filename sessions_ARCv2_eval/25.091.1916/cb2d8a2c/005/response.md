Transformation Rule:
1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Identify all blue (1) pixels in the input grid and change their color to red (2) in the output grid. These red pixels, along with any pre-existing red (2) pixels in the input, will form barriers.
3. Locate the single green (3) pixel in the original input grid; this is the starting seed for the flood fill.
4. Perform a flood fill operation starting from the seed coordinates using Breadth-First Search (BFS).
5. The fill color is green (3), and it spreads only into adjacent azure (8) pixels.
6. The fill propagates horizontally and vertically (4-connectivity).
7. The fill is blocked by any red (2) pixels (either originally red or converted from blue), any other non-azure pixels, and by the grid boundaries.
8. Return the modified output grid containing the original non-azure/non-blue pixels, the converted blue-to-red pixels, and the green filled area.
