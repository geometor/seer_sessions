Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consist of horizontal stripes (bands) of solid colors. Each stripe spans the full width of the grid. The height of each stripe can vary.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are larger squares. They appear to be constructed from concentric frames, where the color and thickness of each frame are derived from the input stripes.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation takes the sequence of horizontal color bands from the input and uses them to build the output grid outwards-in (or inwards-out). The outermost band in the input corresponds to the outermost frame in the output, the next input band corresponds to the next frame inward, and so on, until the final input band forms the central core of the output grid.
4.  **Frame Thickness:** The thickness of each concentric frame (or the size of the central core for the last band) in the output directly corresponds to the height (number of rows) of the corresponding color band in the input grid.
5.  **Output Size:** The size of the output square grid is determined by the heights of the input bands. Specifically, if the band heights are `h1, h2, ..., hn`, the output grid dimension `N` is calculated as `N = 2 * (h1 + h2 + ... + hn-1) + hn`.

    input:
      - band_list
      - output_grid
      - N
    output: filled_output_grid
    details:
      - Uses band color for frame/core color.
      - Uses band height for frame thickness / core size.
      - Each frame fills the available space between the previous (outer) frame and the next (inner) frame boundary.
      - The last band fills the remaining central rectangular area.

relationships:
  - input_band_order -> output_frame_order (outermost to innermost)
  - input_band_height -> output_frame_thickness / core_size
  - input_band_color -> output_frame_color / core_color
  - input_band_heights -> output_grid_size
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Analyze Input Bands:** Scan the input grid from top to bottom. Identify contiguous horizontal bands of the same color. Record the sequence of these bands, noting the color and height (number of rows) for each distinct band encountered. Store this as an ordered list of `(color, height)` pairs.
2.  **Calculate Output Dimension:** Let the heights of the identified bands be `h1, h2, ..., hn`. Calculate the dimension `N` for the square output grid using the formula: `N = (2 * h1) + (2 * h2) + ... + (2 * hn-1) + hn`.
3.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a new square grid of size `N x N`.
4.  **Construct Output Frames:**
    *   Initialize a `current_offset` variable to 0.
    *   Iterate through the band list from the first band (`i=0`) up to the second-to-last band (`i=n-2`). For each band `i` with color `c_i` and height `h_i`:
        *   Define the boundaries for the current frame layer:
            *   `top_row_start = current_offset`
            *   `top_row_end = current_offset + h_i - 1`
            *   `bottom_row_start = N - 1 - current_offset - h_i + 1`
            *   `bottom_row_end = N - 1 - current_offset`
            *   `left_col_start = current_offset`
            *   `left_col_end = current_offset + h_i - 1`
            *   `right_col_start = N - 1 - current_offset - h_i + 1`
            *   `right_col_end = N - 1 - current_offset`
        *   Fill the top horizontal part of the frame: Set pixels from row `top_row_start` to `top_row_end` and column `left_col_start` to `right_col_end` to color `c_i`.
        *   Fill the bottom horizontal part of the frame: Set pixels from row `bottom_row_start` to `bottom_row_end` and column `left_col_start` to `right_col_end` to color `c_i`.
        *   Fill the left vertical part of the frame (between top and bottom parts): Set pixels from column `left_col_start` to `left_col_end` and row `top_row_end + 1` to `bottom_row_start - 1` to color `c_i`.
        *   Fill the right vertical part of the frame (between top and bottom parts): Set pixels from column `right_col_start` to `right_col_end` and row `top_row_end + 1` to `bottom_row_start - 1` to color `c_i`.
        *   Update the offset for the next inner frame: `current_offset = current_offset + h_i`.
    *   **Fill Center Core:** For the last band (`n-1`) with color `c_last` and height `h_last`:
        *   Fill the central rectangular area defined by rows `current_offset` to `N - 1 - current_offset` and columns `current_offset` to `N - 1 - current_offset` with color `c_last`. (Note: This central area will have dimensions `h_last x h_last`).
5.  **Return Output:** The completed `N x N` grid is the result.
