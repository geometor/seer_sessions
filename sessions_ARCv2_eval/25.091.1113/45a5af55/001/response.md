"""
Transforms an input grid composed of horizontal color bands into an output square grid made of concentric frames.

The transformation process involves:
1. Analyzing the input grid to identify the sequence of horizontal color bands from top to bottom, noting the color and height (number of rows) of each band.
2. Calculating the dimension `N` of the output square grid based on the heights of the input bands using the formula: N = (2 * h1) + (2 * h2) + ... + (2 * hn-1) + hn, where h1 to hn are the heights of the bands in sequence. If there is only one band (n=1), N = h1.
3. Initializing an N x N output grid.
4. Constructing the output grid by drawing concentric frames:
    - The outermost frame corresponds to the first input band (color c1, thickness h1).
    - The next inner frame corresponds to the second input band (color c2, thickness h2), placed inside the first frame.
    - This continues until the second-to-last band (n-1).
    - The final, innermost band (n) fills the remaining central rectangular area. The dimensions of this central area will correspond to the height hn.
5. Returning the constructed output grid.
