"""
Transforms an input grid by performing a pattern fill operation originating from 
seed pixels and propagating through fillable areas, respecting background and 
terminator pixels.

The process involves:
1.  Determining parameters based on input grid characteristics (currently hardcoded 
    based on training examples):
    - Background color: Unchanged, acts as boundary.
    - Fillable color: Area to be overwritten by the pattern.
    - Seed color(s): Initiate the fill into adjacent fillable areas.
    - Terminator color(s): Halt the pattern fill, retain their color, act as boundary.
    - Erased color(s): (Optional) Replaced by background color before filling.
    - Pattern Sequence: Repeating sequence of colors used for filling.
    - Seed Handling: Rule for seed pixels ('retain' original color or 'replace' 
      with the first pattern color).
2.  Initializing an output grid.
3.  Pre-processing the grid and initializing a 'visited' set:
    - Copy the input grid to the output grid.
    - Populate the 'visited' set with the coordinates of all pixels that are *not* 
      the fillable color in the input grid (background, seeds, terminators, erased).
    - Update the output grid: Replace erased colors with the background color. 
      If seed handling is 'replace', update seed pixels in the output grid with the 
      first pattern color.
4.  Identifying initial fill locations: Find pixels that were originally fillable 
    and are 8-directionally adjacent to any original seed pixel location.
5.  Performing a Breadth-First Search (BFS) pattern fill:
    - Seed the BFS queue with the initial fill locations, coloring them with the 
      first pattern color and marking them as visited. Store the pattern index (0) used.
    - While the queue is not empty:
        - Dequeue a pixel P and the pattern index 'current_idx' used to color it.
        - Calculate the next pattern index 'next_idx' and corresponding 'next_color'.
        - For each 8-directional neighbor N of P:
            - If N is within grid bounds and has *not* been visited:
                - Color N with 'next_color' in the output grid.
                - Mark N as visited.
                - Enqueue N with 'next_idx'.
6.  Returning the modified grid. The fill naturally stops at grid edges, pre-marked 
    visited pixels (background, terminators, seeds), and already filled pixels.
