Identifying key color roles dynamically (Placeholder - currently hardcoded per example):\n    - Background color: Generally unchanged.\n    - Fillable color: Area to be overwritten.\n    - Seed color(s): Initiate the fill.\n    - Terminator color(s): Stop the fill, retaining their color.\n    - Erased color(s): Replaced by background color before filling.\n    - Pattern Sequence: Repeating sequence of colors for filling.\n    - Seed Handling: How seed pixels are treated ('retain' or 'replace').\n2.  Initializing an output grid as a copy of the input.\n3.  Pre-processing:\n    - Replacing Erased colors with the Background color.\n    - Modifying Seed pixels according to the Seed Handling rule.\n4.  Identifying initial fill locations: Fillable pixels adjacent (8-directionally) to original Seed pixels.\n5.  Performing a Breadth-First Search (BFS) pattern fill:\n    - Starting from initial fill locations, color them with the first pattern color.\n    - Propagate the fill into adjacent Fillable pixels.\n    - The color applied to a new pixel depends cyclically on the color of the pixel it's propagating from, following the Pattern Sequence.\n    - The fill stops at grid boundaries, Background pixels, Terminator pixels, and already filled pixels.\n6.
