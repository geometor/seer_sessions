"""
Transforms an input grid by performing a pattern fill operation.

The process involves:
1.  Identifying key color roles dynamically (Placeholder - currently hardcoded per example):
    - Background color: Generally unchanged.
    - Fillable color: Area to be overwritten.
    - Seed color(s): Initiate the fill.
    - Terminator color(s): Stop the fill, retaining their color.
    - Erased color(s): Replaced by background color before filling.
    - Pattern Sequence: Repeating sequence of colors for filling.
    - Seed Handling: How seed pixels are treated ('retain' or 'replace').
2.  Initializing an output grid as a copy of the input.
3.  Pre-processing:
    - Replacing Erased colors with the Background color.
    - Modifying Seed pixels according to the Seed Handling rule.
4.  Identifying initial fill locations: Fillable pixels adjacent (8-directionally) to original Seed pixels.
5.  Performing a Breadth-First Search (BFS) pattern fill:
    - Starting from initial fill locations, color them with the first pattern color.
    - Propagate the fill into adjacent Fillable pixels.
    - The color applied to a new pixel depends cyclically on the color of the pixel it's propagating from, following the Pattern Sequence.
    - The fill stops at grid boundaries, Background pixels, Terminator pixels, and already filled pixels.
6.  Returning the modified grid.
