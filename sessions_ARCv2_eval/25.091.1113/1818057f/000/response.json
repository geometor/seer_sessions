It occurs in specific configurations. Comparing input and output grids, the pixels that change form a '+' shape (a central pixel and its four orthogonal neighbors).\n4.  **Condition for Change:** A '+' shape configuration of pixels changes color *only if* all five pixels comprising the shape (center and four orthogonal neighbors) are yellow (4) in the input grid.\n5.  **Result of Change:** When the condition is met, all five yellow pixels forming that specific '+' shape change their color to azure (8) in the output grid. Pixels not part of such a \"qualifying\" yellow '+' shape retain their original input color.\n6.  **Multiple Instances:** The transformation applies independently to all occurrences of qualifying yellow '+' shapes within the grid (as seen clearly in `train_2`).\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Iterate through each cell (pixel) in the input grid at `(row, column)`, excluding the border rows and columns (i.e., iterate from `row = 1` to `height - 2` and `column = 1` to `width - 2`), considering each as a potential center of a '+' shape.\n3.  For each potential center cell `(row, column)`:\n    a.  Check if the color of the center cell `(row, column)` is yellow (4).\n    b.  Check if the color of the top neighbor `(row - 1, column)` is yellow (4).\n    c.  Check if the color of the bottom neighbor `(row + 1, column)` is yellow (4).\n    d.  Check if the color of the left neighbor `(row, column - 1)` is yellow (4).\n    e.  Check if the color of the right neighbor `(row, column + 1)` is yellow (4).\n4.  If all five conditions in step 3 (a-e) are true (i.e., the cell and all four orthogonal neighbors are yellow in the input grid):\n    a.  Update the color of the cell at `(row, column)` in the *output* grid to azure (8).\n    b.  Update the color of the cell at `(row - 1, column)` in the *output* grid to azure (8).\n    c.  Update the color of the cell at `(row + 1, column)` in the *output* grid to azure (8).\n    d.  Update the color of the cell at `(row, column - 1)` in the *output* grid to azure (8).\n    e.  Update the color of the cell at `(row, column + 1)` in the *output* grid to azure (8).\n5.  After checking all possible center cells, return the final output grid."
