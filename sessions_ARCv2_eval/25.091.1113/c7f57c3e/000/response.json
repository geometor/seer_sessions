The background color itself can be subject to change (as seen implicitly in train\\_1 where yellow remains yellow, and explicitly in train\\_2 where green remains green).\n3.  **Objects:** There are distinct shapes or patterns formed by non-background colors. These appear as objects within the grid.\n4.  **Color Transformation:** The primary change between input and output grids appears to be a specific color substitution rule applied globally.\n5.  **Train 1 Analysis:** The input contains yellow (4), blue (1), red (2), green (3), and azure (8). The output contains the same colors. No magenta (6) is present. Yellow pixels remain yellow. Other colors also seem to remain, although their positions change based on a complex vertical pattern relative to red pixels (this initial interpretation turned out to be incorrect when considering train\\_2).\n6.  **Train 2 Analysis:** The input contains green (3), blue (1), red (2), yellow (4), and magenta (6). The output contains green (3), blue (1), red (2), yellow (4), and magenta (6). Critically, input yellow (4) pixels become magenta (6) in the output, and the input magenta (6) pixel becomes yellow (4). Green (3), blue (1), and red (2) pixels remain unchanged.\n7.  **Combined Rule:** Comparing both examples reveals a simple, consistent rule: yellow (4) and magenta (6) are swapped. All other colors remain unchanged. The complex pattern observed in train\\_1 alone was likely a coincidental feature of that specific example and not the core rule. The rule applies pixel-wise across the entire grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
