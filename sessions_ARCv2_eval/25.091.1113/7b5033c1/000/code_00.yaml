task_type: extraction_and_serialization
input_description: A 2D grid of pixels with a dominant background color and several foreground objects composed of different colors.
output_description: A 1D vertical grid (column vector) containing the pixel values of the foreground objects from the input.
elements:
  - role: background
    description: The most frequent pixel color in the input grid. It is ignored during processing.
    properties: [dominant_color]
  - role: foreground_pixels
    description: Pixels in the input grid whose color is different from the background color.
    properties: [color, position]
  - role: color_groups
    description: Collections of all foreground pixels sharing the same color.
    properties: [color, count, first_occurrence_position]
relationships:
  - type: grouping
    description: Foreground pixels are grouped by their color.
  - type: ordering
    description: The color groups are ordered based on the row-major scan order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) of the first pixel encountered for each color group in the input grid.
actions:
  - action: identify_background
    description: Determine the background color (most frequent color) in the input grid.
  - action: scan_and_order
    description: Scan the input grid row by row, then column by column, to find the first occurrence of each non-background color. Record the order in which these colors are first encountered.
  - action: count_pixels
    description: For each non-background color identified, count the total number of pixels of that color in the input grid.
  - action: serialize_output
    description: Construct the output column by appending each non-background color value repeatedly, according to its count, following the order determined by the scan_and_order action.
