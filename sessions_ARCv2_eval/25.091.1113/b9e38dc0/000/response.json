            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nEach task example consists of an input grid and a corresponding output grid. The grids contain pixels of different colors. The core transformation seems to involve a \"filling\" process where one color expands into the background color, constrained by other colors.\n\n1.  **Example 1:** The input has a blue background (1), green (3) and gray (5) pixels forming a partial boundary, and a single maroon (9) pixel inside this boundary. The output shows the maroon (9) color having filled the blue (1) area enclosed by the green (3) and gray (5) pixels. The original boundary and maroon pixels remain.\n2.  **Example 2:** The input has a white background (0), gray (5) pixels forming scattered boundary elements, and a single yellow (4) pixel. The output shows the yellow (4) color having filled the white (0) area connected to the original yellow pixel, stopping when it encounters gray (5) pixels.\n3.  **Example 3:** The input has an orange background (7), maroon (9) pixels forming an outer boundary, green (3) pixels inside this boundary, and some isolated magenta (6) and azure (8) pixels. The output shows the green (3) color having filled the orange (7) area within the maroon (9) boundary, starting from the original green (3) pixels. The maroon, magenta, and azure pixels remain unchanged and act as implicit boundaries for the fill.\n\nThe common pattern is a flood fill operation. A specific color (\"fill color\") expands into the background color. All other non-background colors act as boundaries, halting the expansion. The fill originates from the initial position(s) of the fill color.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

In the examples, it seems to be the color whose flood fill (using other non-background colors as boundaries) successfully generates the output. A more direct selection criteria isn't immediately obvious from just these three examples (e.g., it's not always the unique color, nor always the color with fewest/most pixels).\n\n```"
