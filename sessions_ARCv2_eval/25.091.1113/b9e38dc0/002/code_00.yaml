task_type: pattern_transformation
transformation_name: selective_flood_fill
common_elements:
  - grid_representation: 2D array of integers (colors)
  - background_color: The most frequent color in the input grid. Acts as the area to be filled.
objects:
  - type: fill_source
    properties:
      - color: One of the non-background colors.
      - role: Its pixels are the starting points for the flood fill.
      - identification: Determined by simulation - the color whose flood fill (using other non-background colors as boundaries) matches the target output.
  - type: boundary
    properties:
      - color: All non-background colors *except* the fill_source color.
      - role: Impassable barriers that stop the flood fill. Pixels of these colors remain unchanged.
actions:
  - identify_background_color: Find the most frequent color.
  - identify_non_background_colors: Find all unique colors != background.
  - simulate_fill_for_each_candidate:
      For each non_background_color C:
        - Designate C as potential_fill_color.
        - Designate others as boundary_colors.
        - Perform flood_fill starting from C's initial pixels into background_color, stopping at boundary_colors or grid edges.
        - Store the resulting grid.
  - select_correct_fill: Compare each simulated grid to the target output grid. The simulation that matches identifies the correct fill_color and the final output grid.
relationships:
  - fill_source color expands into background_color areas.
  - boundary colors contain the expansion of the fill_source color.
