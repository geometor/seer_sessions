            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial hypothesis, based on Example 1, suggested a flood-fill mechanism constrained by green barriers. However, testing this against all examples revealed significant discrepancies, particularly massive overfilling compared to the expected outputs. The original code correctly implemented the flood-fill, indicating the underlying transformation logic was misunderstood.\n\nRe-analysis, focusing on Examples 2, 3, and 4, strongly suggests a \"projection\" or \"ray casting\" mechanism rather than flood fill. In these examples, colors from \"seed\" pixels (non-gray, non-green) are projected outwards in straight lines (orthogonal and diagonal) onto adjacent gray pixels. These projections continue until they hit a green pixel, a non-gray pixel (that wasn't gray initially), or the grid boundary. The original seed pixels and green pixels remain unchanged.\n\nExample 1's output does not perfectly align with this projection model, as the resulting colored pixels appear sparse and sometimes non-contiguous with the projection lines. However, given that the projection model perfectly explains Examples 2, 3, and 4, it represents the most likely general rule. Example 1 might be an edge case, have a subtle variation, or its provided output might highlight a specific aspect not immediately obvious.\n\nThe strategy is to adopt the projection model (Hypothesis v2 from thought process) as the primary explanation, refine the description and YAML facts accordingly, and implement code based on this model.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the grids based on the projection hypothesis.\n\n"
