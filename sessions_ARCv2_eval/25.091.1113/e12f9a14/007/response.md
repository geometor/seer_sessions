"""
Perform a multi-source flood fill on a grid, originating from 'seed' pixels.

1. Identify 'seed' pixels: Any pixel not colored gray (8) or green (3).
2. Identify 'barrier' pixels: Green (3) pixels.
3. Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
4. Initialize a queue with all seed pixel locations and their colors.
5. Initialize a 'visited' grid/set, marking barrier and seed pixels as initially visited.
6. Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS):
   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a pixel (r, c) with its fill_color.
   - For each of its 8 neighbors (nr, nc):
     - Check if the neighbor is within bounds.
     - Check if the neighbor was originally gray (8) in the input grid.
     - Check if the neighbor has not been visited yet.
     - If all conditions are met:
       - Color the neighbor in the output grid with fill_color.
       - Mark the neighbor as visited.
       - Enqueue the neighbor with the same fill_color.
7. Return the modified output grid.
