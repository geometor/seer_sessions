Observations:
  - Input contains a background color, hollow rectangular frames, and noise pixels.
  - Output contains the background color and modified frames, with noise removed.

Background:
  - Property: The most frequent color in the input grid.
  - Role: Fills the space not occupied by frames or noise in the input, and replaces noise in the output.

Objects:
  - Type: Hollow Rectangular Frame
    - Properties:
      - Composed of a single, non-background color.
      - Forms the perimeter of a rectangle.
      - Has a bounding box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col).
      - Has a specific color.
    - Actions:
      - Identified in the input.
      - Preserved in the output.
      - Modified internally in the output.
  - Type: Noise Pixel
    - Properties:
      - Any color different from the background.
      - Not part of a contiguous hollow rectangular frame structure.
    - Actions:
      - Identified in the input.
      - Removed in the output (replaced by background color).

Transformations:
  - Noise Removal:
    - Condition: Pixel is not background color AND not part of any identified frame.
    - Action: Change pixel color to background color.
  - Frame Modification (Dot Insertion):
    - For each frame:
      - Target Row: The middle row of the frame's bounding box (`mid_row = (min_row + max_row) // 2`).
      - Target Columns: Columns strictly inside the frame's left and right boundaries (`min_col + 1` to `max_col - 1`).
      - Pattern: Color pixels at `(mid_row, col)` with the frame's color if the column index `col` is odd relative to the first *internal* column (`(col - (min_col + 1)) % 2 != 0`).

Relationships:
  - Frames are distinct objects on the background.
  - Noise pixels are separate from frames and background.
  - The modification pattern inside a frame depends on its bounding box dimensions and color.
