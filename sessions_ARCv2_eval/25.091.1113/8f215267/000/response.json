Additionally, there are scattered pixels of various colors (\"noise\") that are not part of the background or the rectangular frames.\n\nThe transformation involves two main steps:\n1.  **Noise Removal:** All pixels that are neither the background color nor part of a hollow rectangular frame are removed (replaced with the background color).\n2.  **Frame Modification:** Pixels are added inside each hollow rectangular frame. Specifically, along the horizontal line that vertically bisects the frame, pixels are colored with the frame's color in an alternating pattern, starting from the second column inside the frame's boundary.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify all hollow rectangular frames in the input grid. For each frame, record its color and its bounding box coordinates (minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, maximum column). A frame is a connected perimeter of a single non-background color forming a rectangle.\n3.  Create a new grid (the output grid) as a copy of the input grid.\n4.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid. If the color of the pixel `input[r, c]` is not the background color AND the pixel `(r, c)` is not part of any identified rectangular frame's perimeter, change the corresponding pixel in the output grid `output[r, c]` to the background color.\n5.  For each identified rectangular frame with color `C` and bounding box `min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c`:\n    a. Calculate the middle row index: `mid_row = floor((min_r + max_r) / 2)`.\n    b. Define the starting internal column index: `start_internal_col = min_c + 1`.\n    c. Iterate through the columns `col` from `start_internal_col` to `max_c - 1`.\n    d. If the column index `col` relative to the `start_internal_col` is odd (i.e., `(col - start_internal_col)` is odd, or equivalently `(col - start_internal_col) % 2 != 0`), set the pixel in the output grid at `output[mid_row, col]` to the frame's color `C`.\n6.
