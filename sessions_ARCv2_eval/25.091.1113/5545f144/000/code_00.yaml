task_description: Find vertical columns acting as dividers, identify the background color, count foreground pixels in each section defined by the dividers, and output the section with the maximum count of foreground pixels.

elements:
  - role: input_grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors.
  - role: output_grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels, representing a subgrid derived from the input.
  - role: divider_column
    description: A vertical column in the input grid where all pixels share the same color. This color is consistent across all divider columns within a single input.
    properties:
      - uniformity: All pixels in the column have the same color.
      - function: Partitions the grid into vertical sections.
  - role: divider_color
    description: The color of the pixels within the divider columns.
  - role: background_color
    description: The most frequent color in the input grid, excluding the divider columns.
    properties:
      - prevalence: Most common pixel color outside dividers.
  - role: section
    description: A vertical subgrid of the input grid, located between divider columns or between a grid edge and a divider column.
  - role: foreground_pixel
    description: A pixel within a section whose color is neither the background_color nor the divider_color.
    properties:
      - color: Distinguishes it from background and dividers.

actions:
  - name: identify_divider_columns
    description: Scan the input grid column by column to find columns composed of a single, repeating color. Determine the divider_color.
  - name: identify_background_color
    description: Count the frequency of each color in the input grid, ignoring pixels in the divider columns. The color with the highest frequency is the background_color.
  - name: segment_grid
    description: Use the identified divider columns to split the input grid into vertical sections.
  - name: count_foreground_pixels
    description: For each section, count the number of pixels that are neither the background_color nor the divider_color.
  - name: select_target_section
    description: Identify the section(s) with the maximum count of foreground pixels. If there is a tie, select the leftmost section among those tied.
  - name: generate_output
    description: Create the output grid by copying the selected target section.

relationships:
  - type: defines
    source: divider_columns
    target: sections
    description: Divider columns define the boundaries between sections.
  - type: excludes
    source: foreground_pixel
    target: [background_color, divider_color]
    description: A foreground pixel's color cannot be the background or divider color.
  - type: determines
    source: count_of_foreground_pixels_in_sections
    target: selected_target_section
    description: The maximum count determines which section is selected.
  - type: equals
    source: output_grid
    target: selected_target_section
    description: The output grid is identical to the selected target section.
