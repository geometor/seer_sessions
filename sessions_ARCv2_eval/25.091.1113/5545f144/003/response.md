"""
The transformation rule involves identifying vertical divider columns (columns where all pixels have the same color, and this color is consistent across all such columns). 
These dividers split the input grid into vertical sections. 
The background color is determined as the most frequent color in the grid, excluding the pixels within the divider columns. 
Foreground pixels within each section are defined as those whose color is neither the background color nor the divider color. 
The rule is to count these foreground pixels in each section. 
The output grid is a copy of the section that contains the maximum number of foreground pixels. 
If multiple sections tie for the maximum count, the leftmost section among them is chosen.
