            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code failed on all training examples. The core issue stemmed from an incorrect initial identification of the 'divider' columns and 'background' color based on the code's execution (`tool_code` output), which contradicted a visual interpretation that actually aligns with the expected outputs.\n\nThe execution results showed that the implemented `find_divider_columns` function latched onto the first uniform column color it found, even if that color was the most prevalent color (visually the background) and not the intended separator color. Consequently, the `find_background_color` function also derived an incorrect background.\n\nThe successful strategy involves reverting to the initial *visual* interpretation of the roles, but defining the identification logic more precisely:\n\n1.  **Identify Overall Most Frequent Color:** Determine the color that appears most often in the entire input grid.\n2.  **Identify Potential Divider Columns:** Find all columns in the grid that are perfectly uniform (composed of a single color).\n3.  **Determine True Divider Color:** Among the colors forming uniform columns (identified in step 2), the true `divider_color` is the one that is *not* the overall most frequent color (identified in step 1). If multiple such colors exist, assume based on the examples that only one will fit this criteria and act as the separator.\n4.  **Determine Background Color:** The `background_color` is the overall most frequent color identified in step 1.\n5.  **Define Sections:** Split the grid vertically using the columns composed of the true `divider_color` as separators.\n6.  **Define Foreground Pixels:** Pixels within a section whose color is neither the `divider_color` nor the `background_color`.\n7.  **Select Section:** Count the foreground pixels in each section. The output is the section with the maximum count. Ties are broken by choosing the leftmost section.\n\nThis revised logic correctly interprets the roles and relationships in all training examples.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nBased on the revised understanding:\n\n*   **Train 1:**\n    *   Overall Most Frequent Color: 1 (Blue)\n    *   Uniform Column Colors Found: 1 (Blue), 3 (Green)\n    *   Divider Color: 3 (Green) (since 1 is most frequent overall)\n    *   Background Color: 1 (Blue)\n    *   Foreground Color: 4 (Yellow)\n    *   Divider Indices (Green): [8, 17]\n    *   Sections (Indices): `[:, 0:8]`, `[:, 9:17]`, `[:, 18:27]`\n    *   Section Shapes: `(10, 8)`, `(10, 8)`, `(10, 9)`\n    *   Foreground (Yellow) Counts: [7, 4, 3]\n    *   Max Count: 7 (Index 0)\n    *   Selected Section: `[:, 0:8]` (Matches Expected Output)\n\n*   **Train 2:**\n    *   Overall Most Frequent Color: 0 (White)\n    *   Uniform Column Colors Found: 0 (White), 2 (Red)\n    *   Divider Color: 2 (Red) (since 0 is most frequent overall)\n    *   Background Color: 0 (White)\n    *   Foreground Color: 3 (Green)\n    *   Divider Indices (Red): [6, 13, 20]\n    *   Sections (Indices): `[:, 0:6]`, `[:, 7:13]`, `[:, 14:20]`, `[:, 21:27]`\n    *   Section Shapes: `(8, 6)`, `(8, 6)`, `(8, 6)`, `(8, 6)`\n    *   Foreground (Green) Counts: [6, 5, 4, 7]\n    *   Max Count: 7 (Index 3)\n    *   Selected Section: `[:, 21:27]` (Matches Expected Output)\n\n*   **Train 3:**\n    *   Overall Most Frequent Color: 5 (Gray)\n    *   Uniform Column Colors Found: 4 (Yellow), 5 (Gray)\n    *   Divider Color: 4 (Yellow) (since 5 is most frequent overall)\n    *   Background Color: 5 (Gray)\n    *   Foreground Color: 6 (Magenta)\n    *   Divider Indices (Yellow): [12]\n    *   Sections (Indices): `[:, 0:12]`, `[:, 13:25]`\n    *   Section Shapes: `(12, 12)`, `(12, 12)`\n    *   Foreground (Magenta) Counts: [11, 8]\n    *   Max Count: 11 (Index 0)\n    *   Selected Section: `[:, 0:12]` (Matches Expected Output)\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
