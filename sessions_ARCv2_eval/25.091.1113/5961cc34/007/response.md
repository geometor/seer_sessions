Transformation Rule:
1. Identify an "activation column" defined by the vertical alignment of a unique yellow (4) pixel located directly above one or more red (2) pixels in the same column within the input grid.
2. Find all distinct contiguous objects made of blue (1) pixels using 8-way connectivity (orthogonal and diagonal).
3. Determine if any blue object intersects the activation column.
4. If intersection occurs:
    a. Identify *all* blue objects that intersect the activation column ("activated objects").
    b. Create a single set containing all coordinates belonging to *any* of the activated objects. This forms the "target fill area".
    c. Find all green (3) pixels in the input grid.
    d. Determine the "hole coordinates": these are the locations of green pixels that are either *within* the target fill area or adjacent (8-way, including diagonally) to any pixel within the target fill area.
    e. Initialize the output grid filled with the background color (azure 8).
    f. Fill the output grid with red (2) at the locations corresponding to the target fill area, *except* for the hole coordinates, which remain the background color (azure 8).
5. If no blue object intersects the activation column:
    a. Initialize the output grid filled with the background color (azure 8).
    b. Fill the output grid with a vertical red (2) line in the activation column, spanning the full height of the grid.
