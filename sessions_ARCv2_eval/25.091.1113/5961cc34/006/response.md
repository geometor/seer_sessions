## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code correctly identified the core mechanism: an activation column defined by yellow-over-red pixels triggers a transformation related to blue shapes. It also handled the "no intersection" case (Example 1) correctly. However, the code failed when multiple blue shapes intersected the activation column or when green "hole" pixels were present near the activated shapes (Examples 2, 3, 4).

The errors indicate that:
1.  **Activated shapes might merge:** When multiple blue shapes intersect the activation column, they should potentially be treated as a single entity for filling, possibly connecting them in the output (as seen in Example 2 and 3's expected output).
2.  **Hole definition needs refinement:** The logic for determining which green pixels create holes and their relation to the activated blue shapes needs adjustment. A green pixel seems to create a hole if it is adjacent (including diagonally) to *any* part of the combined area of *all* activated blue shapes.

**Strategy:**
1.  Modify the logic to first identify *all* blue shapes intersecting the activation column.
2.  Combine the coordinates of *all* these activated shapes into a single set.
3.  Identify *all* green pixels from the input.
4.  Determine the "hole coordinates" by finding green pixels that are adjacent (8-way connectivity, including diagonals) to *any* coordinate in the combined set of activated blue shape coordinates. Also include green pixels that are *within* the combined set itself.
5.  Fill the combined activated shape coordinates with red, *except* for the identified hole coordinates.
