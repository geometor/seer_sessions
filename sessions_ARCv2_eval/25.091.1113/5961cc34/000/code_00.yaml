elements:
  - role: background
    color: azure (8)
    description: Fills the grid initially and replaces consumed or inactive elements.
  - role: shape_template
    color: blue (1)
    description: Defines potential shapes to be filled. Exists as one or more contiguous objects.
  - role: hole_marker
    color: green (3)
    description: Marks locations within or adjacent to blue shapes that should not be filled in the output.
  - role: activation_column_marker
    color: yellow (4)
    description: A single pixel marking the column used for activation. Always appears above red pixels.
  - role: activation_color_source
    color: red (2)
    description: Pixels located below the yellow pixel, confirming the activation column. Also the color used to fill activated shapes in the output.

actions:
  - identify_activation_column:
      input: yellow (4) and red (2) pixel locations
      output: the specific column index containing these pixels
  - identify_target_shapes:
      input: blue (1) shapes, activation_column
      output: the set of blue shapes that have at least one pixel in the activation column
  - identify_holes:
      input: green (3) pixel locations, target_shapes
      output: the set of green pixel locations adjacent (including diagonally) to any pixel within the target_shapes
  - fill_shapes:
      input: target_shapes, holes, activation_color_source (red 2)
      output: A grid where locations corresponding to target_shapes are filled with red (2), except for locations corresponding to holes, which remain background color (azure 8).
  - clear_inactive_elements:
      input: original grid, filled shapes grid
      output: final grid where all input elements not part of the filled shapes (including holes) are replaced by the background color (azure 8).

relationships:
  - The yellow (4) and red (2) pixels vertically align to define a single column.
  - Activation depends on a blue (1) shape intersecting the activation column.
  - Green (3) pixels act as exclusion zones (holes) only if associated with an activated blue shape.
  - The output color for filled shapes is determined by the input activation_color_source (red 2).
