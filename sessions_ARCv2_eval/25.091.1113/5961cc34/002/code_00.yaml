elements:
  - role: background
    color: azure (8)
    description: Fills the grid initially and replaces inactive/consumed elements or forms the base grid.
  - role: shape_template
    color: blue (1)
    description: Defines potential shapes to be filled. Exists as one or more contiguous objects (8-way connectivity).
  - role: hole_marker
    color: green (3)
    description: Marks locations within or adjacent (8-way) to blue shapes that should not be filled in the output *if* the corresponding blue shape is activated.
  - role: activation_column_marker
    color: yellow (4)
    description: A single pixel marking the column used for activation. Always appears above red pixels.
  - role: activation_trigger
    color: red (2)
    description: Pixels located below the yellow pixel, confirming the activation column. Also the color used for filling/drawing in the output.

actions:
  - identify_activation_column:
      input: yellow (4) and red (2) pixel locations
      output: the specific column index containing these pixels
  - find_blue_objects:
      input: grid, blue (1) color
      output: a list of sets, where each set contains the (row, col) coordinates of a distinct blue object (using 8-way connectivity).
  - check_intersection:
      input: list of blue_objects, activation_column
      output: boolean indicating if any blue object has a pixel in the activation column.
  - identify_activated_shapes_and_holes:
      condition: check_intersection is true
      input: blue_objects, activation_column, green (3) pixel locations
      output:
        - activated_shapes: list of coordinate sets for blue objects intersecting the activation column.
        - all_hole_coords: set of coordinates corresponding to green pixels that are within or adjacent (8-way) to any activated_shape.
  - fill_activated_shapes:
      condition: check_intersection is true
      input: grid_shape, activated_shapes, all_hole_coords, fill_color (red 2), background_color (azure 8)
      output: an output grid filled with background_color, where pixels in activated_shapes are set to fill_color, unless they are in all_hole_coords.
  - draw_activation_line:
      condition: check_intersection is false
      input: grid_shape, activation_column, fill_color (red 2), background_color (azure 8)
      output: an output grid filled with background_color, where all pixels in the activation_column are set to fill_color.

relationships:
  - The yellow (4) and red (2) pixels vertically align to define a single activation column.
  - Blue (1) objects are defined by 8-way (including diagonal) connectivity.
  - The transformation depends entirely on whether any blue (1) object intersects the activation column.
  - If intersection occurs, green (3) pixels act as exclusion zones (holes) only if they are within or adjacent (8-way) to an *activated* blue shape.
  - If no intersection occurs, blue and green pixels are ignored, and a red line is drawn.
