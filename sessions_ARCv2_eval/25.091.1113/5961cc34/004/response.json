            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial transformation function successfully solved Example 1, demonstrating a correct understanding of the \"no intersection\" case where a vertical line is drawn. However, it failed on Examples 2, 3, and 4, which involve blue shapes intersecting the activation column. The failures indicate issues in correctly identifying *all* activated blue shapes, determining the precise set of \"hole\" coordinates based on green pixels adjacent to activated shapes, and filling the combined area of all activated shapes minus the holes. The core concepts (activation column, blue shapes, green holes, red fill) seem correct, but their implementation and interaction logic need refinement, especially regarding aggregation when multiple shapes are activated. 8-way connectivity for shapes and adjacency appears to be the correct interpretation based on the expected outputs.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nWe will analyze the key components for each training example.\n\n"
