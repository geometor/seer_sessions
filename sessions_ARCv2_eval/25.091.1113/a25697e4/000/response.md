Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Background:** The consistent background color across all examples is blue (1). This color seems inert and defines the space where transformations occur.
2.  **Objects:** The inputs contain distinct objects or clusters of objects composed of colors other than blue (red=2, green=3, yellow=4 in train_1/2; gray=5, orange=7, magenta=6 in train_3). These objects have specific shapes, sizes, colors, and positions.
3.  **Conditional Transformation:** The core transformation logic appears to depend fundamentally on the specific combination of colors present in the input grid, specifically whether *both* green (3) and yellow (4) are present.
4.  **Case 1 (Green and Yellow Present):** When both green (3) and yellow (4) are in the input (train\_1, train\_2), the transformation involves:
    *   Identifying distinct spatial clusters of non-background colors.
    *   Counting the pixels of each color (red, green, yellow) within each cluster.
    *   Swapping the *counts* of green and yellow pixels. Red pixel counts remain unchanged.
    *   Reconstructing the clusters in the output, possibly in different locations and using simplified shapes (like lines or blocks), based on the modified pixel counts. The spatial separation of input clusters seems preserved in the output.
5.  **Case 2 (Green and Yellow NOT Both Present):** When the input does not contain both green (3) and yellow (4) simultaneously (train\_3), the transformation involves:
    *   Identifying individual non-background objects.
    *   Preserving the original shape and color of each object.
    *   Relocating these objects within the grid. The objects in the output appear closer together than in the input, suggesting a compaction or movement towards a common area (seemingly bottom-center/right in train\_3), while roughly maintaining their relative spatial arrangement. The exact rule for relocation isn't perfectly clear but involves translation without rotation or significant shape change.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_context:
  background_color: 1 (blue)
  transformation_type: conditional based on input colors

conditions:
  - name: green_and_yellow_present
    trigger: Grid contains both color 3 (green) AND color 4 (yellow) pixels (excluding background).
    actions:
      - Identify spatial clusters of non-background pixels.
      - For each cluster:
          - Count pixels of each color (e.g., red_count, green_count, yellow_count).
          - Calculate modified counts: new_green_count = old_yellow_count, new_yellow_count = old_green_count, other counts unchanged.
          - Reconstruct cluster in output grid using modified counts.
          - Output shapes may be simplified (e.g., lines, blocks).
          - Relative spatial location of clusters is preserved (e.g., left cluster stays left).
  - name: green_and_yellow_not_both_present
    trigger: Grid does NOT contain both color 3 (green) AND color 4 (yellow) pixels simultaneously.
    actions:
      - Identify individual non-background objects (connected components of a single color).
      - Preserve the shape and color of each object.
      - Relocate objects to a new position in the output grid.
      - Relocation appears to move objects closer together, potentially towards the bottom-center/right area, maintaining approximate relative positions.

example_specifics:
  train_1_and_2:
    condition: green_and_yellow_present
    input_clusters:
      - left: 8 red pixels
      - right: 4 green, 7 yellow pixels
    output_clusters (based on swapped counts):
      - left: 8 red, 4 yellow pixels
      - right: 7 green pixels
  train_3:
    condition: green_and_yellow_not_both_present
    input_objects:
      - object_1: gray(5), specific shape, count=6
      - object_2: orange(7), specific shape, count=4
      - object_3: magenta(6), specific shape, count=4
    output_objects:
      - object_1: gray(5), same shape, count=6, relocated
      - object_2: orange(7), same shape, count=4, relocated
      - object_3: magenta(6), same shape, count=4, relocated
    relocation_effect: Objects moved generally down/right and closer together.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid's background color (blue, 1).
2.  Scan the input grid to determine if pixels of color green (3) AND pixels of color yellow (4) are both present.
3.  **If both green (3) and yellow (4) are present:**
    a.  Identify distinct connected clusters of non-background pixels in the input grid. Treat clusters separated by the background color as distinct.
    b.  For each identified input cluster:
        i.  Record its approximate location/region (e.g., left side, right side, top, bottom).
        ii. Count the number of pixels for each color within that cluster (specifically red=2, green=3, yellow=4).
        iii. Calculate the *output* pixel counts for this cluster: swap the green and yellow counts recorded in the previous step. Keep the red count (and any other color counts) the same.
        iv. Determine the corresponding output region based on the input cluster's region.
        v. Populate the output region with pixels according to the calculated output counts (original red count, swapped green count, swapped yellow count). Use simple shapes like horizontal lines or rectangular blocks to represent these counts compactly within the region.
4.  **If green (3) and yellow (4) are NOT both present:**
    a.  Identify all individual, connected non-background objects in the input grid. An object is a contiguous area of the same non-background color.
    b.  For each object, record its original color, shape (relative pixel coordinates), and location (e.g., bounding box or top-left coordinate).
    c.  Determine a target location for each object in the output grid. (This step requires a precise rule, but observation suggests objects are moved, potentially based on a collective property like the overall bounding box or centroid, towards a common target area like the bottom-center/right, while preserving their shapes, colors, and approximate relative positions, possibly becoming more compact).
    d.  Draw each object onto the output grid at its new target location, using its original shape and color. Handle potential overlaps if necessary (the examples don't show conflict resolution, perhaps later objects overwrite earlier ones).
5.  Return the final output grid.
