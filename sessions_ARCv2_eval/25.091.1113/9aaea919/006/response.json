            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic involving specific shapes (5-pixel pluses and horizontal lines) and colors. The rules derived seemed consistent across the examples. The timeout error encountered during testing strongly suggests that the implementation strategy (iterating pixel-by-pixel and checking for shapes locally) was inefficient for the 30x30 grid size, rather than the logic being flawed. The next step should be to reimplement the logic using a more efficient object-finding approach, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Connected Components Labeling, to identify distinct objects first and then apply the rules to those objects.\n\n*   **Metrics and Analysis:**\n    We will analyze each training example to confirm the shapes, colors, and transformations. Let's define the shapes:\n    *   `plus`: 5 pixels in a '+' shape.\n    *   `hline`: 5 pixels in a '-' shape (horizontal line).\n"
