The rules appear consistent across all three training examples.\n    *   The code implementing this logic timed out during execution on the training set. This suggests that while the core logic might be correct, the implementation (specifically object detection via BFS and subsequent shape/color checks) is likely too slow for the 30x30 grid size within the allowed time limit.\n    *   The strategy is to refine the understanding of the objects and rules based on all examples, ensuring the natural language program is accurate and complete. The implementation efficiency will be a key concern for the coder phase, but the dreamer phase focuses on accurately describing *what* needs to happen.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    "

An object is a group of 5 connected pixels of the same non-background color.\n    4.  For each identified 5-pixel object:\n        a.  Determine its shape: is it a 'plus' (center pixel with 4 orthogonal neighbors) or a 'horizontal_line' (1x5 row)?\n        b.  Determine its color.\n        c.  If the object's shape is 'horizontal_line' AND its color is Red (2) or Green (3), do nothing (the area remains background color in the output grid).\n        d.  If the object's shape is 'plus' AND its color is Maroon (9), Magenta (6), or Green (3), draw the same 'plus' shape at the corresponding location in the output grid using the Gray (5) color.\n        e.  If the object's shape is 'plus' AND its color is *not* Maroon (9), Magenta (6), or Green (3), draw the same 'plus' shape at the corresponding location in the output grid using the object's original color.\n        f.  (Implicitly) If an object doesn't match these specific shapes and conditions (though none are seen in examples), it is ignored (remains background color).\n    5.  Return the completed output grid."
