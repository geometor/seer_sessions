            "text": "**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids maintain the same dimensions. The background color is consistently Azure (8).\n2.  **Key Colors:** The task prominently features Red (2) and Yellow (4) pixels, often interacting with each other. Blue (1) and Green (3) pixels also appear, often forming static structures or acting as boundaries.\n3.  **Static Elements:** Some structures, like the blue shapes and the red/green lines/segments, seem to remain unchanged between input and output, *except* where they are overwritten by the transformation rule.\n4.  **Target Colors & Trigger:** Red (2) and Yellow (4) appear to be \"target\" colors. Their presence in certain configurations triggers the main transformation.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves generating vertical alternating patterns of Red (2) and Yellow (4) in specific columns.\n6.  **Column Identification:** The columns to be modified are identified based on the presence and combination of the target colors (Red and Yellow):\n    *   A column containing *both* Red and Yellow pixels is modified. (Example 1, Column 10)\n    *   A pair of *adjacent* columns, where one contains Red (but not Yellow) and the other contains Yellow (but not Red), are *both* modified. (Example 2, Columns 8 and 9)\n7.  **Pattern Generation:**\n    *   The pattern always uses Red (2) and Yellow (4).\n    *   The pattern fills the identified column(s) from the top row (row 0) downwards.\n    *   The pattern stops just before the first row containing a non-background pixel that is *not* Red or Yellow (acting as a \"stopper\"). In the examples, Blue (1) acts as a stopper. If no stopper exists below, the pattern likely continues to the bottom row.\n    *   The starting color of the alternating pattern depends on the configuration:\n        *   If a single column contained both Red and Yellow, the starting color is the color of the *lowest* Red or Yellow pixel found in that column in the input.\n        *   If an adjacent pair of columns (one Red-only, one Yellow-only) triggered the modification, the starting color is determined by the target pixel with the *minimum row index* across the pair. If both are at the same minimum row, the color from the *leftmost* column of the pair is used. This same starting color is used for both columns in the pair.\n8.  **Overwriting:** The generated pattern overwrites any existing content in the affected column segments. Pixels outside these segments (in other columns, or below the stopper row in the modified columns) are copied unchanged from the input.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify the set of columns `M` that need modification based on two conditions:\n    a.  Find all columns that contain *both* Red and Yellow pixels. Add these columns to `M`. Remember which rule identified them (Rule A).\n    b.  Find all pairs of adjacent columns `(x, x+1)` where `x` contains *only* Red (from the target colors) and `x+1` contains *only* Yellow (from the target colors), OR vice-versa. Add both `x` and `x+1` to `M`, ensuring not to add duplicates already present from rule (a). Remember which rule identified them (Rule B).\n4.  For each column `x` in the set `M`:\n    a.  Determine the starting color for the alternating Red/Yellow pattern:\n        i.  If column `x` was identified by Rule A (contains both Red and Yellow): Find the lowest row `y` in column `x` containing either Red or Yellow in the *input* grid. The color of the input pixel `input[y, x]` is the starting color.\n        ii. If column `x` was identified by Rule B (adjacent pair): Consider the pair `(x, x+1)` (or `(x-1, x)` if `x` is the right column of the pair). Find the minimum row index `y_min` of any target color pixel within this pair in the *input* grid. Check the pixel(s) at `y_min`. If only one column has a target pixel at `y_min`, use its color. If both have target pixels at `y_min`, use the color from the left column of the pair. This determined color is the starting color for column `x`. (Note: This same starting color will be used for the other column in the pair when its turn comes).\n    b.  Determine the sequence of colors (e.g., if Red starts: Red, Yellow, Red, Yellow...; if Yellow starts: Yellow, Red, Yellow, Red...).\n    c.  Determine the stop row `y_stop`: Find the first row index `y` (starting from 0) such that the input pixel `input[y, x]` is *not* the background color (Azure 8) and is *not* one of the target colors (Red 2 or Yellow 4). If such a pixel is found at row `y`, the pattern should fill rows 0 to `y-1`. If no such pixel exists in the column, the pattern fills all rows (0 to grid height - 1).\n    d.  Modify the `output_grid`: Fill column `x` from row 0 up to (and including) row `y_stop` (or the last row if no stopper was found) using the determined alternating color sequence.\n5.  Return the final `output_grid`."
