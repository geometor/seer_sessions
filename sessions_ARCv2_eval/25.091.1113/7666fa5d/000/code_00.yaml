  - description: Grid properties
    properties:
      - grid_size_input: 16x16 (consistent across examples)
      - grid_size_output: 16x16 (same as input)
      - background_color: azure (8)
      - fill_color: red (2)
  - description: Objects in input
    objects:
      - object: Background
        color: azure (8)
        role: defines exterior space
      - object: Boundary Pixels
        color: yellow (4) in example 1, green (3) in example 2
        role: form closed loops, define enclosed regions
        properties:
          - are contiguous or connected to form shapes
          - separate interior regions from exterior background
  - description: Transformation action
    action:
      - name: identify_regions
        steps:
          - Identify the background color (azure 8).
          - Identify boundary pixels (non-azure colors).
          - Identify regions of background color pixels completely enclosed by boundary pixels.
      - name: fill_regions
        target: Enclosed background regions
        result: Change color to red (2)
  - description: Relationships
    relationship:
      - type: Preservation
        element1: Input Background Pixels (exterior)
        element2: Output Background Pixels (exterior)
        detail: Pixels remain azure (8).
      - type: Preservation
        element1: Input Boundary Pixels
        element2: Output Boundary Pixels
        detail: Pixels retain their original color (yellow 4 or green 3).
      - type: Containment
        element1: Boundary Pixel Loops
        element2: Filled Red (2) Regions
        detail: The red regions are located spatially inside the areas enclosed by the boundary loops.
      - type: Adjacency
        element1: Filled Red (2) Pixels
        element2: Boundary Pixels
        detail: Red pixels are often adjacent (including diagonally) to the boundary pixels that enclose them.
