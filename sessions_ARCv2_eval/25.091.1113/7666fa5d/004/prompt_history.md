**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Size:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions (16x16 in both examples).
2.  **Color Palette:** The examples use azure (8) as the primary background color. Example 1 uses yellow (4) for foreground elements, and Example 2 uses green (3). The output introduces red (2) as a new color while preserving the original colors.
3.  **Background Preservation:** The azure (8) pixels that are part of the exterior background remain unchanged in the output.
4.  **Foreground Preservation:** The non-background pixels present in the input (yellow 4 in example 1, green 3 in example 2) are preserved in their original locations in the output. These pixels seem to form closed loops or boundaries.
5.  **Filling:** The key transformation is the addition of red (2) pixels. These red pixels appear to fill the areas *enclosed* by the loops formed by the non-background pixels (yellow or green).
6.  **Interior Definition:** The "inside" of the loop seems to be defined relative to the grid; areas connected to the grid boundary via the background color are considered "outside". Any background-colored regions completely surrounded by the non-background color loop are "inside".
7.  **Consistency:** The fill color is always red (2), regardless of the color forming the boundary (yellow or green).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Define the background color as azure (8).
3.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are *not* the background color; these are the "boundary" pixels.
4.  Create a marker grid of the same dimensions to track visited background pixels, initialized to 'unvisited'.
5.  Iterate through all pixels on the border (edges) of the grid.
6.  If a border pixel contains the background color and is marked 'unvisited':
    a.  Start a flood fill (using 4-way adjacency - up, down, left, right) from this pixel.
    b.  During the flood fill, only move to adjacent pixels that contain the background color and are 'unvisited'.
    c.  Mark every reachable background pixel as 'visited' on the marker grid.
7.  After checking all border pixels, iterate through every pixel (r, c) in the grid.
8.  If the pixel at (r, c) in the original input contains the background color AND its corresponding location in the marker grid is still 'unvisited':
    a.  Change the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the *output* grid to red (2).
9.  Return the final output grid.
```python
"""
This program transforms an input grid by filling enclosed regions.
1. It identifies the background color (azure 8).
2. It performs a flood fill starting from all background-colored pixels on the grid's border. This marks all background pixels connected to the outside.
3. It iterates through the grid. Any background pixel that was *not* reached by the flood fill (i.e., is enclosed by non-background pixels) is changed to red (2).
4. Non-background pixels and background pixels connected to the border remain unchanged.
