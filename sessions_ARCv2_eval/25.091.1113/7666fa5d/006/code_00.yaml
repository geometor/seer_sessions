  - description: Grid properties
    properties:
      - grid_size_input: 16x16 (consistent across examples)
      - grid_size_output: 16x16 (same as input)
      - background_color: azure (8), identified as the most frequent color in input.
      - fill_color: red (2), identified as the color present in output but not input.
  - description: Objects in input
    objects:
      - object: Background
        color: azure (8)
        role: occupies space, can be exterior (connected to border) or interior (enclosed)
      - object: Boundary Pixels
        color: yellow (4) in example 1, green (3) in example 2 (variable non-background colors)
        role: form structures that potentially enclose background regions
        properties:
          - Are preserved in the output grid at their original locations and with their original colors.
          - Separate some background regions from the grid border.
  - description: Transformation action
    action:
      - name: identify_exterior_background
        method: Flood fill (BFS) using 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right)
        start_points: All background pixels located on the grid's border (row 0, last row, col 0, last col).
        target: All background pixels reachable from the border via a path of only background pixels.
        output: A set of coordinates or a boolean mask marking these exterior background pixels.
      - name: fill_interior_background
        target: All background pixels that were *not* identified as exterior background.
        result: Change the color of these target pixels to red (2) in the output grid.
        preservation: Pixels identified as exterior background and all original boundary pixels retain their original colors.
  - description: Relationships
    relationship:
      - type: Preservation
        element1: Input Boundary Pixels
        element2: Output Boundary Pixels
        detail: Location and color are unchanged.
      - type: Preservation
        element1: Exterior Background Pixels (connected to border)
        element2: Corresponding Output Pixels
        detail: Location and color (azure 8) are unchanged.
      - type: Transformation (Color Change)
        element1: Interior Background Pixels (enclosed, not connected to border)
        element2: Corresponding Output Pixels
        detail: Color changes from azure (8) to red (2). Location is unchanged.
      - type: Spatial Containment
        element1: Boundary Pixel structures
        element2: Interior Background Pixels / Filled Red (2) Pixels
        detail: The interior/filled pixels are spatially surrounded by boundary pixels, preventing a 4-way path of background pixels to the grid border.
      - type: Connectivity (Flood Fill)
        element1: Border Background Pixels
        element2: Exterior Background Pixels
        detail: Connected via paths of 4-way adjacent background pixels.
