            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code attempt failed to modify the input grid, indicating that the core logic for identifying and filling enclosed regions did not execute as intended. The transformed output was identical to the input in both examples. This suggests that the condition used to identify internal background pixels (`grid[r, c] == background_color and not visited_exterior[r, c]`) was never met. This implies the flood fill incorrectly marked *all* background pixels as being connected to the exterior.\n\nThe metric analysis confirms the initial hypothesis:\n1.  The background color is azure (8).\n2.  Non-background colors in the input act as boundaries (yellow 4 or green 3).\n3.  These boundaries are preserved in the output.\n4.  Regions of the background color (8) that are fully enclosed by boundary pixels are changed to red (2).\n5.  Background pixels connected to the grid edge remain unchanged.\n6.  The number of background pixels lost equals the number of red pixels gained.\n\nThe strategy remains to identify background pixels connected to the exterior and then fill any background pixels *not* connected to the exterior. The failure was likely in the implementation of the flood fill (BFS) or boundary detection, not the overall concept. The refined approach will re-implement the flood fill carefully, ensuring correct neighbour checking (4-way adjacency) and state tracking (visited markers).\n\n**Metrics Analysis**\n"
