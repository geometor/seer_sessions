Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** Contains mostly background pixels (white, 0) and a distinct shape or pattern made of azure (8) pixels. The dimensions vary between examples.
2.  **Output Grid:** Has the same dimensions as the corresponding input grid. It also contains only white (0) and azure (8) pixels. The azure pattern in the output is significantly different and generally larger than the input pattern.
3.  **Transformation:** The azure pixels in the input seem to act as barriers or "walls". The output grid appears to be generated by a process that fills areas of the grid with azure, starting from the borders, but is blocked by these input barriers.
4.  **Colors:** White (0) represents empty or background space. Azure (8) in the input represents barriers. Azure (8) in the output represents areas reachable from the border without crossing a barrier. White (0) in the output represents both the original barrier locations and any background areas that were *not* reachable from the border.
5.  **Connectivity:** The filling process seems to use 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right). Diagonal movement does not appear relevant for the fill propagation.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: "Perform a flood fill starting from the white border cells, using the input azure cells as barriers. The filled area becomes azure in the output, everything else becomes white."
grid_properties:
  - size_relation: Output grid dimensions are identical to input grid dimensions.
  - color_palette_input: [white (0), azure (8)]
  - color_palette_output: [white (0), azure (8)]
objects:
  - object: background_cell
    color: white (0)
    location: Input grid
    role: Represents potentially fillable space.
  - object: barrier_cell
    color: azure (8)
    location: Input grid
    role: Acts as an impassable wall during the fill process.
  - object: border_cell
    location: Input grid cells at row 0, last row, column 0, or last column.
    role: Potential starting points for the flood fill if they are background_cells.
  - object: filled_cell
    color: azure (8)
    location: Output grid
    derivation: A background_cell reachable from a border_cell without crossing any barrier_cells.
  - object: unfilled_cell
    color: white (0)
    location: Output grid
    derivation: Either an original barrier_cell location or a background_cell not reachable from any border_cell due to barriers.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    connects: grid cells
    directionality: 4-way (up, down, left, right)
    relevance: Defines the path for flood fill propagation.
  - type: blockage
    actor: barrier_cell
    action: Prevents flood fill propagation through its location.
  - type: reachability
    from: border_cell (if white in input)
    to: background_cell
    condition: Path exists using 4-way adjacency without passing through barrier_cells.
actions:
  - action: initialize_output
    result: Create a new grid of same dimensions as input, filled with white (0).
  - action: identify_barriers
    source: input_grid
    criteria: Cells with value azure (8).
    result: A set of barrier coordinates.
  - action: flood_fill_from_borders
    target: output_grid
    start_condition: Cells on the border of the input grid that are white (0).
    propagation: Move to adjacent (4-way) cells that are within grid bounds and are NOT barrier cells.
    effect: Mark reachable cells in the output_grid with azure (8).
  - action: finalize_output
    result: The output_grid after the flood fill is complete. Cells not marked azure (8) remain white (0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid, `output_grid`, with the same height and width as the `input_grid`, and initialize all its cells to white (0).
2.  Identify all cells in the `input_grid` that contain the azure (8) color. Store their coordinates as a set called `barrier_locations`.
3.  Create a queue data structure (e.g., FIFO) to manage cells to visit during the fill process.
4.  Create a set data structure, `visited_locations`, to keep track of cells that have been added to the queue to prevent redundant processing.
5.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` located on the border of the `input_grid` (where `r` is 0 or the maximum row index, or `c` is 0 or the maximum column index).
6.  For each border cell `(r, c)`:
    *   Check if this cell's location `(r, c)` is *not* in `barrier_locations`.
    *   If it is not a barrier, add the location `(r, c)` to the `queue` and to the `visited_locations` set. Also, set the color of the cell `(r, c)` in the `output_grid` to azure (8).
7.  While the `queue` is not empty:
    *   Remove a location `(r, c)` from the front of the `queue`.
    *   Examine the four adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right) of `(r, c)`. Let a neighbor's location be `(nr, nc)`.
    *   For each neighbor `(nr, nc)`:
        *   Verify that `(nr, nc)` is within the bounds of the grid.
        *   Verify that `(nr, nc)` has not already been added to `visited_locations`.
        *   Verify that `(nr, nc)` is *not* in the `barrier_locations` set.
        *   If all these conditions are true:
            *   Add `(nr, nc)` to the `queue`.
            *   Add `(nr, nc)` to the `visited_locations` set.
            *   Set the color of the cell `(nr, nc)` in the `output_grid` to azure (8).
8.  After the `queue` is empty, the `output_grid` contains the final pattern. Return the `output_grid`.

Perform a flood fill starting from the white (0) border cells of the input grid.
The fill propagates only through adjacent white (0) cells in the input grid.
Input azure (8) cells act as barriers and stop the fill.
All cells reachable by the fill (starting from the white border cells) are marked

Cells that were originally barriers (input azure 8) or were white (0) but unreachable
