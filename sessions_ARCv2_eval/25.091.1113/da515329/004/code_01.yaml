task_description: "Perform a flood fill starting from the white border cells of the input grid. The input azure cells act as barriers. Mark all reachable white cells as azure in the output grid. Barrier cells and unreachable white cells remain white in the output."
grid_properties:
  - size_relation: Output grid dimensions are identical to input grid dimensions.
  - color_palette_input: [white (0), azure (8)]
  - color_palette_output: [white (0), azure (8)]
objects:
  - object: background_cell
    color: white (0)
    location: Input grid
    role: Represents potentially fillable space. Can be a starting point if on the border.
  - object: barrier_cell
    color: azure (8)
    location: Input grid
    role: Acts as an impassable wall during the fill process. Retains white color in output.
  - object: border_cell
    location: Input grid cells at row 0, last row, column 0, or last column.
    role: Starting point for the flood fill IF its color in the input grid is white (0).
  - object: reachable_cell
    location: A cell (r, c) in the input grid.
    derivation: A cell is reachable if it is white (0) in the input grid AND there is a path of adjacent (4-way) white (0) input cells connecting it to a white (0) border cell.
  - object: output_azure_cell
    color: azure (8)
    location: Output grid
    condition: The corresponding cell in the input grid was a reachable_cell.
  - object: output_white_cell
    color: white (0)
    location: Output grid
    condition: The corresponding cell in the input grid was either a barrier_cell (azure 8) or a background_cell (white 0) that was not reachable from any white border cell.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    connects: grid cells
    directionality: 4-way (up, down, left, right)
    relevance: Defines the path for flood fill propagation through white (0) cells.
  - type: blockage
    actor: barrier_cell (input azure 8)
    action: Prevents flood fill propagation through its location.
  - type: reachability
    from: border_cell (if white 0 in input)
    to: background_cell (white 0 in input)
    condition: Path exists using 4-way adjacency consisting only of white (0) input cells.
actions:
  - action: initialize_output
    result: Create a new grid of same dimensions as input, filled with white (0).
  - action: identify_start_points
    source: input_grid
    criteria: Cells on the border where input_grid value is white (0).
  - action: flood_fill_from_white_borders
    target: output_grid
    start_points: Result from identify_start_points.
    propagation: Move to adjacent (4-way) cells `(nr, nc)` if they are within grid bounds AND `input_grid[nr, nc]` is white (0).
    effect: Mark visited cells in the output_grid with azure (8).
  - action: finalize_output
    result: The output_grid after the flood fill is complete. Cells not marked azure (8) remain white (0).
