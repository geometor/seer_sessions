**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis was incorrect. The previous code assumed a flood fill starting from the *white* border cells, using the input azure cells as barriers. The results clearly show this leads to overfilling the grid with azure.

The key insight from reviewing the failed examples is that the output pattern seems to represent the areas *unreachable* from the initial azure cells, while staying within the grid boundaries. The white areas in the output correspond precisely to the original azure input cells *plus* all the white input cells that can be reached from those initial azure cells via 4-way adjacency without crossing the grid border.

The strategy is to reverse the logic:
1.  Identify the starting points: these are the azure (8) cells in the input grid.
2.  Perform a flood fill (BFS or DFS) starting from these azure cells.
3.  The fill should only propagate into adjacent *white* (0) cells within the grid boundaries.
4.  Keep track of all cells visited during this fill (both the initial azure cells and the reachable white cells).
5.  Construct the output grid: Mark all *unvisited* cells as azure (8) and all *visited* cells as white (0).

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's analyze the relationship between input azure cells, reachable white cells, and the output grid for `train_1`.

**Revised Assessment:**

The metric gathering code confirms the second hypothesis is also incorrect. Filling from the input azure cells into adjacent white cells visits *all* cells in the grid, resulting in an entirely white output grid according to the proposed logic (visited = white, unvisited = azure). This also does not match the expected outputs.

Let's rethink the interaction between the fill and the borders/barriers.

Maybe the fill *does* start from the border, but the *input azure cells* define areas that are *protected* from the fill?

Consider `train_1`:
Input has an azure cross. Output has azure everywhere *except* the original cross locations and the central white square enclosed by the cross.

New Hypothesis 3:
1.  Start a flood fill from *all* white (0) cells on the border of the *input* grid.
2.  The fill can propagate to adjacent (4-way) white (0) cells only.
3.  The fill *cannot* enter cells that were originally azure (8) in the input. These azure cells act as barriers.
4.  Mark all cells visited by this fill process.
5.  Create the output grid:
    *   Cells that were visited by the fill become azure (8) in the output.
    *   Cells that were *not* visited (either because they were original barriers or because they were white cells enclosed by barriers) become white (0) in the output.

This seems identical to the *first* hypothesis, which produced the incorrect code. Why did that code fail? Let's re-examine the first code's output for `train_1`:

Expected Output:

```
0 8 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8
...
```

Transformed Output (from first attempt):

```
8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
...
```

The code filled *everything* reachable from the border, including the border cells themselves, with azure (8). The expected output has *some* border cells remaining white (0).

Why would a border cell remain white? It could only happen if that border cell itself was an azure barrier in the input.

Let's re-examine the first code:

```python
# Seed the queue with white border cells
for r in range(height):
    for c in [0, width - 1]: # Left and right borders
        # PROBLEM: This condition checks the *barrier_locations* set
        # It SHOULD check the *input_grid* value at (r,c)
        if (r, c) not in barrier_locations and (r,c) not in visited:
            queue.append((r, c))
            visited.add((r, c))
            output_grid[r, c] = 8 # Mark reachable cell in output
# ... similar logic for top/bottom ...

# Perform the flood fill (BFS)
while queue:
    r, c = queue.popleft()
    # Explore neighbors
    for dr, dc in moves:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:
            # PROBLEM: This condition ALSO checks the *barrier_locations* set
            # It SHOULD check the *input_grid* value at (nr, nc)
            if (nr, nc) not in barrier_locations and (nr, nc) not in visited:
                visited.add((nr, nc))
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                output_grid[nr, nc] = 8
```

The issue was subtle. The code correctly identified `barrier_locations` (where `input_grid == 8`). However, during the BFS seeding and propagation, it checked `if (coord) not in barrier_locations` instead of the more direct `if input_grid[coord] == 0`. While these seem equivalent *if* the only non-zero input color is 8, relying on the pre-computed set might have masked an error or led to slightly different behavior than intended. The core logic *should* be: start fill from border cells *if they are white (0)*, propagate to adjacent cells *if they are white (0)*.

Let's retry the first hypothesis with the corrected logic check (`input_grid[coord] == 0`).

**Final Hypothesis (Revisiting the First):**

1.  Initialize the output grid to all white (0).
2.  Identify starting points: All cells `(r, c)` on the border (row 0, last row, col 0, last col) where `input_grid[r, c] == 0`.
3.  Perform a flood fill (BFS) starting from these points.
4.  The fill propagates to adjacent (4-way) cells `(nr, nc)` only if `input_grid[nr, nc] == 0` and the cell hasn't been visited.
5.  For every cell visited by the fill (including the starting border cells), set the corresponding cell in the output grid to azure (8).
6.  Cells that were not visited (either because they were `input_grid == 8` or were white cells unreachable from the border due to barriers) remain white (0) in the output grid.

**YAML Facts (Refined based on Final Hypothesis):**

**Natural Language Program (Refined based on Final Hypothesis):**

1.  Create a new grid, `output_grid`, with the same dimensions as the `input_grid`, initialized entirely with white (0) pixels.
2.  Create a queue for the flood fill (Breadth-First Search) and a set `visited_locations` to track cells added to the queue.
3.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` located on the border of the `input_grid` (row 0, last row, column 0, last column).
4.  For each border cell `(r, c)`:
    *   Check if the value of `input_grid[r, c]` is white (0).
    *   Check if the location `(r, c)` has *not* already been added to `visited_locations`.
    *   If both conditions are true, add `(r, c)` to the queue, add `(r, c)` to `visited_locations`, and set `output_grid[r, c]` to azure (8).
5.  While the queue is not empty:
    *   Dequeue a location `(r, c)`.
    *   Examine the four adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right) of `(r, c)`. Let a neighbor's location be `(nr, nc)`.
    *   For each neighbor `(nr, nc)`:
        *   Verify `(nr, nc)` is within the grid boundaries.
        *   Verify `(nr, nc)` has *not* already been added to `visited_locations`.
        *   Verify the value of `input_grid[nr, nc]` is white (0).
        *   If all these conditions are true:
            *   Add `(nr, nc)` to the queue.
            *   Add `(nr, nc)` to `visited_locations`.
            *   Set `output_grid[nr, nc]` to azure (8).
6.  Return the `output_grid`. (Cells corresponding to input azure barriers, and white cells unreachable from the border, will remain white (0) as initialized).
