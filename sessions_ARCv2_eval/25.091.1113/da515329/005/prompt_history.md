Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** Contains mostly background pixels (white, 0) and a distinct shape or pattern made of azure (8) pixels. The dimensions vary between examples.
2.  **Output Grid:** Has the same dimensions as the corresponding input grid. It also contains only white (0) and azure (8) pixels. The azure pattern in the output is significantly different and generally larger than the input pattern.
3.  **Transformation:** The azure pixels in the input seem to act as barriers or "walls". The output grid appears to be generated by a process that fills areas of the grid with azure, starting from the borders, but is blocked by these input barriers.
4.  **Colors:** White (0) represents empty or background space. Azure (8) in the input represents barriers. Azure (8) in the output represents areas reachable from the border without crossing a barrier. White (0) in the output represents both the original barrier locations and any background areas that were *not* reachable from the border.
5.  **Connectivity:** The filling process seems to use 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right). Diagonal movement does not appear relevant for the fill propagation.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: "Perform a flood fill starting from the white border cells, using the input azure cells as barriers. The filled area becomes azure in the output, everything else becomes white."
grid_properties:
  - size_relation: Output grid dimensions are identical to input grid dimensions.
  - color_palette_input: [white (0), azure (8)]
  - color_palette_output: [white (0), azure (8)]
objects:
  - object: background_cell
    color: white (0)
    location: Input grid
    role: Represents potentially fillable space.
  - object: barrier_cell
    color: azure (8)
    location: Input grid
    role: Acts as an impassable wall during the fill process.
  - object: border_cell
    location: Input grid cells at row 0, last row, column 0, or last column.
    role: Potential starting points for the flood fill if they are background_cells.
  - object: filled_cell
    color: azure (8)
    location: Output grid
    derivation: A background_cell reachable from a border_cell without crossing any barrier_cells.
  - object: unfilled_cell
    color: white (0)
    location: Output grid
    derivation: Either an original barrier_cell location or a background_cell not reachable from any border_cell due to barriers.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    connects: grid cells
    directionality: 4-way (up, down, left, right)
    relevance: Defines the path for flood fill propagation.
  - type: blockage
    actor: barrier_cell
    action: Prevents flood fill propagation through its location.
  - type: reachability
    from: border_cell (if white in input)
    to: background_cell
    condition: Path exists using 4-way adjacency without passing through barrier_cells.
actions:
  - action: initialize_output
    result: Create a new grid of same dimensions as input, filled with white (0).
  - action: identify_barriers
    source: input_grid
    criteria: Cells with value azure (8).
    result: A set of barrier coordinates.
  - action: flood_fill_from_borders
    target: output_grid
    start_condition: Cells on the border of the input grid that are white (0).
    propagation: Move to adjacent (4-way) cells that are within grid bounds and are NOT barrier cells.
    effect: Mark reachable cells in the output_grid with azure (8).
  - action: finalize_output
    result: The output_grid after the flood fill is complete. Cells not marked azure (8) remain white (0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid, `output_grid`, with the same height and width as the `input_grid`, and initialize all its cells to white (0).
2.  Identify all cells in the `input_grid` that contain the azure (8) color. Store their coordinates as a set called `barrier_locations`.
3.  Create a queue data structure (e.g., FIFO) to manage cells to visit during the fill process.
4.  Create a set data structure, `visited_locations`, to keep track of cells that have been added to the queue to prevent redundant processing.
5.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` located on the border of the `input_grid` (where `r` is 0 or the maximum row index, or `c` is 0 or the maximum column index).
6.  For each border cell `(r, c)`:
    *   Check if this cell's location `(r, c)` is *not* in `barrier_locations`.
    *   If it is not a barrier, add the location `(r, c)` to the `queue` and to the `visited_locations` set. Also, set the color of the cell `(r, c)` in the `output_grid` to azure (8).
7.  While the `queue` is not empty:
    *   Remove a location `(r, c)` from the front of the `queue`.
    *   Examine the four adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right) of `(r, c)`. Let a neighbor's location be `(nr, nc)`.
    *   For each neighbor `(nr, nc)`:
        *   Verify that `(nr, nc)` is within the bounds of the grid.
        *   Verify that `(nr, nc)` has not already been added to `visited_locations`.
        *   Verify that `(nr, nc)` is *not* in the `barrier_locations` set.
        *   If all these conditions are true:
            *   Add `(nr, nc)` to the `queue`.
            *   Add `(nr, nc)` to the `visited_locations` set.
            *   Set the color of the cell `(nr, nc)` in the `output_grid` to azure (8).
8.  After the `queue` is empty, the `output_grid` contains the final pattern. Return the `output_grid`.

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis was incorrect. The previous code assumed a flood fill starting from the *white* border cells, using the input azure cells as barriers. The results clearly show this leads to overfilling the grid with azure.

The key insight from reviewing the failed examples is that the output pattern seems to represent the areas *unreachable* from the initial azure cells, while staying within the grid boundaries. The white areas in the output correspond precisely to the original azure input cells *plus* all the white input cells that can be reached from those initial azure cells via 4-way adjacency without crossing the grid border.

The strategy is to reverse the logic:
1.  Identify the starting points: these are the azure (8) cells in the input grid.
2.  Perform a flood fill (BFS or DFS) starting from these azure cells.
3.  The fill should only propagate into adjacent *white* (0) cells within the grid boundaries.
4.  Keep track of all cells visited during this fill (both the initial azure cells and the reachable white cells).
5.  Construct the output grid: Mark all *unvisited* cells as azure (8) and all *visited* cells as white (0).

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's analyze the relationship between input azure cells, reachable white cells, and the output grid for `train_1`.

**Revised Assessment:**

The metric gathering code confirms the second hypothesis is also incorrect. Filling from the input azure cells into adjacent white cells visits *all* cells in the grid, resulting in an entirely white output grid according to the proposed logic (visited = white, unvisited = azure). This also does not match the expected outputs.

Let's rethink the interaction between the fill and the borders/barriers.

Maybe the fill *does* start from the border, but the *input azure cells* define areas that are *protected* from the fill?

Consider `train_1`:
Input has an azure cross. Output has azure everywhere *except* the original cross locations and the central white square enclosed by the cross.

New Hypothesis 3:
1.  Start a flood fill from *all* white (0) cells on the border of the *input* grid.
2.  The fill can propagate to adjacent (4-way) white (0) cells only.
3.  The fill *cannot* enter cells that were originally azure (8) in the input. These azure cells act as barriers.
4.  Mark all cells visited by this fill process.
5.  Create the output grid:
    *   Cells that were visited by the fill become azure (8) in the output.
    *   Cells that were *not* visited (either because they were original barriers or because they were white cells enclosed by barriers) become white (0) in the output.

This seems identical to the *first* hypothesis, which produced the incorrect code. Why did that code fail? Let's re-examine the first code's output for `train_1`:

Expected Output:

```
0 8 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8
...
```

Transformed Output (from first attempt):

```
8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
...
```

The code filled *everything* reachable from the border, including the border cells themselves, with azure (8). The expected output has *some* border cells remaining white (0).

Why would a border cell remain white? It could only happen if that border cell itself was an azure barrier in the input.

Let's re-examine the first code:

```python
# Seed the queue with white border cells
for r in range(height):
    for c in [0, width - 1]: # Left and right borders
        # PROBLEM: This condition checks the *barrier_locations* set
        # It SHOULD check the *input_grid* value at (r,c)
        if (r, c) not in barrier_locations and (r,c) not in visited:
            queue.append((r, c))
            visited.add((r, c))
            output_grid[r, c] = 8 # Mark reachable cell in output
# ... similar logic for top/bottom ...

# Perform the flood fill (BFS)
while queue:
    r, c = queue.popleft()
    # Explore neighbors
    for dr, dc in moves:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:
            # PROBLEM: This condition ALSO checks the *barrier_locations* set
            # It SHOULD check the *input_grid* value at (nr, nc)
            if (nr, nc) not in barrier_locations and (nr, nc) not in visited:
                visited.add((nr, nc))
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                output_grid[nr, nc] = 8
```

The issue was subtle. The code correctly identified `barrier_locations` (where `input_grid == 8`). However, during the BFS seeding and propagation, it checked `if (coord) not in barrier_locations` instead of the more direct `if input_grid[coord] == 0`. While these seem equivalent *if* the only non-zero input color is 8, relying on the pre-computed set might have masked an error or led to slightly different behavior than intended. The core logic *should* be: start fill from border cells *if they are white (0)*, propagate to adjacent cells *if they are white (0)*.

Let's retry the first hypothesis with the corrected logic check (`input_grid[coord] == 0`).

**Final Hypothesis (Revisiting the First):**

1.  Initialize the output grid to all white (0).
2.  Identify starting points: All cells `(r, c)` on the border (row 0, last row, col 0, last col) where `input_grid[r, c] == 0`.
3.  Perform a flood fill (BFS) starting from these points.
4.  The fill propagates to adjacent (4-way) cells `(nr, nc)` only if `input_grid[nr, nc] == 0` and the cell hasn't been visited.
5.  For every cell visited by the fill (including the starting border cells), set the corresponding cell in the output grid to azure (8).
6.  Cells that were not visited (either because they were `input_grid == 8` or were white cells unreachable from the border due to barriers) remain white (0) in the output grid.

**YAML Facts (Refined based on Final Hypothesis):**

    from: border_cell (if white 0 in input)
    to: background_cell (white 0 in input)
    condition: Path exists using 4-way adjacency consisting only of white (0) input cells.

  - action: finalize_output
    result: The output_grid after the flood fill is complete. Cells not marked azure (8) remain white (0).
```


**Natural Language Program (Refined based on Final Hypothesis):**

1.  Create a new grid, `output_grid`, with the same dimensions as the `input_grid`, initialized entirely with white (0) pixels.
2.  Create a queue for the flood fill (Breadth-First Search) and a set `visited_locations` to track cells added to the queue.
3.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` located on the border of the `input_grid` (row 0, last row, column 0, last column).
4.  For each border cell `(r, c)`:
    *   Check if the value of `input_grid[r, c]` is white (0).
    *   Check if the location `(r, c)` has *not* already been added to `visited_locations`.
    *   If both conditions are true, add `(r, c)` to the queue, add `(r, c)` to `visited_locations`, and set `output_grid[r, c]` to azure (8).
5.  While the queue is not empty:
    *   Dequeue a location `(r, c)`.
    *   Examine the four adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right) of `(r, c)`. Let a neighbor's location be `(nr, nc)`.
    *   For each neighbor `(nr, nc)`:
        *   Verify `(nr, nc)` is within the grid boundaries.
        *   Verify `(nr, nc)` has *not* already been added to `visited_locations`.
        *   Verify the value of `input_grid[nr, nc]` is white (0).
        *   If all these conditions are true:
            *   Add `(nr, nc)` to the queue.
            *   Add `(nr, nc)` to `visited_locations`.
            *   Set `output_grid[nr, nc]` to azure (8).
6.  Return the `output_grid`. (Cells corresponding to input azure barriers, and white cells unreachable from the border, will remain white (0) as initialized).
