task_description: "Perform a flood fill starting from the white border cells, using the input azure cells as barriers. The filled area becomes azure in the output, everything else becomes white."
grid_properties:
  - size_relation: Output grid dimensions are identical to input grid dimensions.
  - color_palette_input: [white (0), azure (8)]
  - color_palette_output: [white (0), azure (8)]
objects:
  - object: background_cell
    color: white (0)
    location: Input grid
    role: Represents potentially fillable space.
  - object: barrier_cell
    color: azure (8)
    location: Input grid
    role: Acts as an impassable wall during the fill process.
  - object: border_cell
    location: Input grid cells at row 0, last row, column 0, or last column.
    role: Potential starting points for the flood fill if they are background_cells.
  - object: filled_cell
    color: azure (8)
    location: Output grid
    derivation: A background_cell reachable from a border_cell without crossing any barrier_cells.
  - object: unfilled_cell
    color: white (0)
    location: Output grid
    derivation: Either an original barrier_cell location or a background_cell not reachable from any border_cell due to barriers.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    connects: grid cells
    directionality: 4-way (up, down, left, right)
    relevance: Defines the path for flood fill propagation.
  - type: blockage
    actor: barrier_cell
    action: Prevents flood fill propagation through its location.
  - type: reachability
    from: border_cell (if white in input)
    to: background_cell
    condition: Path exists using 4-way adjacency without passing through barrier_cells.
actions:
  - action: initialize_output
    result: Create a new grid of same dimensions as input, filled with white (0).
  - action: identify_barriers
    source: input_grid
    criteria: Cells with value azure (8).
    result: A set of barrier coordinates.
  - action: flood_fill_from_borders
    target: output_grid
    start_condition: Cells on the border of the input grid that are white (0).
    propagation: Move to adjacent (4-way) cells that are within grid bounds and are NOT barrier cells.
    effect: Mark reachable cells in the output_grid with azure (8).
  - action: finalize_output
    result: The output_grid after the flood fill is complete. Cells not marked azure (8) remain white (0).
