This module defines a transformation function for an ARC task.
The transformation identifies regions delineated by thick, solid-colored frame lines (horizontal or vertical).
Within each delineated region, it identifies the local background color (most frequent color in that region in the input).
It then replaces all pixels within that region that are not the local background color with the local background color.
The frame lines themselves and any areas outside the delineated regions remain unchanged.
