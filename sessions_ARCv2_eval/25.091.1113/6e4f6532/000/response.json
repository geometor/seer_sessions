            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided training examples for this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples feature a large grid with distinct regions. There's an outer border or frame structure, and an inner region.\n2.  **Frame:** The frame consists of thick, solid lines of specific colors along some or all edges of the grid.\n    *   In `train_1`, the frame is vertical lines: blue (1) on the left, yellow (4) in the middle, and red (2) on the right. The background color (gray 5) exists both inside and outside these frame lines.\n    *   In `train_2`, the frame encloses a rectangular area: red (2) lines at the top, yellow (4) on the left, orange (7) on the right, and green (3) at the bottom.\n3.  **Inner Region:** This is the area enclosed or defined by the frame lines. It contains a background color and various smaller objects composed of different colors.\n    *   In `train_1`, the inner background is gray (5). The objects are made of azure (8), maroon (9), red (2), blue (1), yellow (4).\n    *   In `train_2`, the inner background is blue (1). The objects are made of azure (8), maroon (9), red (2), yellow (4), green (3), orange (7).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation happens *within* the inner region defined by the frame. The frame itself and any areas outside the frame remain unchanged. Inside the inner region, all pixels that are *not* the local background color are changed *to* the local background color. Essentially, the inner region is \"cleaned up\" or \"reset\" to its background color, erasing all the smaller objects within it.\n5.  **Identifying Background:** The relevant background color is the one dominant *within* the inner region (gray 5 in `train_1`, blue 1 in `train_2`), not necessarily the most frequent color in the entire grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

These lines constitute the frame.

This can often be found by sampling a pixel within the inner region that is not part of the frame and not part of any small, distinct object pattern, or by identifying the most frequent color within that inner region.\n5.  **Clean Inner Region:** Iterate through every pixel `(row, column)` located within the inner region defined in step 3.\n6.  **Check Pixel Color:** For each pixel inside the inner region, compare its color in the *input* grid to the local background color identified in step 4.\n7.  **Replace if Necessary:** If the pixel's color is *not* the local background color, change the color of the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid to the local background color.\n8.  **Final Output:** The modified output grid, containing the original frame and exterior areas, and the cleaned inner region, is the result."
