task_description: Erase all objects within a framed area, replacing them with the local background color, while keeping the frame and exterior areas intact.

definitions:
  - object: frame
    description: A set of thick, solid lines of non-background color located near or at the grid edges. Defines an inner region.
    properties:
      - colors: Varies per example (e.g., [blue, yellow, red] in train_1; [red, yellow, orange, green] in train_2)
      - location: Typically along one or more edges (vertical, horizontal, or both).
      - thickness: Often 2 pixels or more.
  - object: inner_region
    description: The area enclosed or delineated by the frame lines.
    properties:
      - contains: local_background, inner_objects
  - object: local_background
    description: The dominant color within the inner_region in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: Varies per example (gray 5 in train_1; blue 1 in train_2)
  - object: inner_objects
    description: Contiguous groups of pixels within the inner_region whose color is different from the local_background color.
    properties:
      - colors: Varies, can include multiple colors different from local_background and frame colors.
      - location: Strictly within the boundaries defined by the frame.

actions:
  - action: identify_frame
    description: Locate the solid lines defining the frame structure.
  - action: identify_inner_region
    description: Determine the bounding box or area defined by the frame.
  - action: identify_local_background
    description: Determine the background color specific to the inner_region.
  - action: erase_inner_objects
    description: Iterate through the inner_region and replace pixels belonging to inner_objects with the local_background color.

relationships:
  - relationship: containment
    subject: inner_objects
    verb: are contained within
    object: inner_region
  - relationship: boundary
    subject: frame
    verb: defines the boundary of
    object: inner_region
  - relationship: persistence
    subject: frame
    verb: remains unchanged
    object: between input and output
  - relationship: persistence
    subject: local_background
    verb: remains unchanged
    object: within the inner_region between input and output (where it existed)
  - relationship: transformation
    subject: inner_objects
    verb: are replaced by
    object: local_background color in the output

example_specific_facts:
  - example: train_1
    frame_colors: [blue(1), yellow(4), red(2)]
    local_background_color: gray(5)
    inner_region_definition: Columns between the frame lines (approx cols 2-11 and 14-23).
  - example: train_2
    frame_colors: [red(2), yellow(4), orange(7), green(3)]
    local_background_color: blue(1)
    inner_region_definition: Rectangular area bounded by the frame lines (approx rows 2-23, cols 2-23).
