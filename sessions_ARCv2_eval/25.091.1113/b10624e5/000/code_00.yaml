grid_properties:
  - width: 27
  - height: 27
  - background_color: 4 # yellow
  - axes:
      - orientation: vertical
        color: 1 # blue
        index: 13 # zero-based column index
      - orientation: horizontal
        color: 1 # blue
        index: 13 # zero-based row index

objects:
  - description: Contiguous areas of pixels with colors other than the background (yellow, 4) or axes (blue, 1).
  - location: Distributed across the grid, off the main axes.
  - properties: Vary in shape, size, and color composition between examples.

transformation:
  - type: reflection
  - axis_of_reflection: vertical
  - axis_location: column 13 (zero-based index)
  - rule: The pixel value at output coordinate (row, col) is determined by the pixel value at input coordinate (row, 26 - col).
  - invariant_elements:
      - Grid dimensions
      - Central vertical blue axis (col 13)
      - Central horizontal blue axis (row 13)
      # Note: The background color (yellow, 4) is not strictly invariant,
      # as it can be overwritten by a reflected object pixel.
      # However, areas that are background in both the original and reflected position remain background.
