grid_properties:
  - width: 27
  - height: 27
  - background_color: 4 # yellow (predominant, but can be overwritten)
  - axes:
      - orientation: vertical
        color: 1 # blue
        index: 13 # zero-based column index (center_col)
      - orientation: horizontal
        color: 1 # blue
        index: 13 # zero-based row index (center_row)
  - width_minus_1: 26 # Useful constant for reflection calculation

objects:
  - description: Contiguous or complex patterns of pixels with colors other than the primary background (yellow, 4) or main axes (blue, 1).
  - location: Present in all four quadrants in the input grids.

transformation:
  - type: Partial Copy and Reflection
  - axis_of_reflection: Vertical axis at index 13
  - rule:
      1. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input.
      2. Copy the left half of the input grid (columns 0 through 13, inclusive) directly to the left half of the output grid (columns 0 through 13).
      3. For the right half of the output grid (columns 14 through 26), populate each cell (row, col) with the value from the input grid at cell (row, 26 - col). This effectively reflects the input grid's columns 0 through 12 onto the output grid's columns 26 down to 14.
  - invariant_elements:
      - Grid dimensions
      - The content of the left half of the grid (columns 0-13) is preserved from input to output.
  - variant_elements:
      - The content of the right half of the grid (columns 14-26) is completely replaced by a reflection of the input's left half. The original content of the input's right half is discarded.
