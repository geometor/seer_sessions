            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the grid structure, axes, and the presence of objects. The first code attempt implemented a simple horizontal reflection across the entire grid's central vertical axis. The results showed this was incorrect because the output grids in the examples do not preserve the original objects from the right half of the input; instead, the left half of the output matches the left half of the input, and the right half of the output is a reflection of the left half of the input.\n\nThe strategy is to revise the transformation rule:\n1.  The output grid should first replicate the left half of the input grid (including the central vertical axis).\n2.  The right half of the output grid should then be populated by reflecting the content of the *input* grid's left half across the central vertical axis.\n3.  The original content of the input grid's right half is effectively discarded.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nTo confirm the revised hypothesis, let's trace key points:\n\n*   **Grid Dimensions:** Both examples use 27x27 grids. Width = 27.\n*   **Vertical Axis:** Column 13 (index).\n*   **Horizontal Axis:** Row 13 (index).\n*   **Reflection Rule:** Output(r, c) = Input(r, 26 - c)\n*   **Left Half:** Columns 0-12.\n*   **Right Half:** Columns 14-26.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n*   Input TL object: Azure (8) at (4, 5). Left half.\n    *   Output TL position (4, 5): Should match input -> Azure (8). **Expected Output matches.**\n    *   Reflection target (TR): Output (4, 26-5) = (4, 21). Should be Azure (8). **Expected Output matches.**\n*   Input TR object: Red (2) at (5, 20). Right half.\n    *   This object should not appear in Output TL. Expected Output TL at (5, 26-20) = (5, 6) is Yellow (4). **Expected Output matches.**\n    *   This object should not appear in Output TR. Output TR at (5, 20) should be the reflection of Input TL at (5, 26-20)=(5, 6), which is Azure (8). **Expected Output matches.**\n*   Input BL object: Red (2) at (20, 3). Left half.\n    *   Output BL position (20, 3): Should match input -> Red (2). **Expected Output matches.**\n    *   Reflection target (BR): Output (20, 26-3) = (20, 23). Should be Red (2). **Expected Output matches.**\n*   Input BR object: Red (2) at (18, 20). Right half.\n    *   This object should not appear in Output BL. Expected Output BL at (18, 26-20) = (18, 6) is Yellow (4). **Expected Output matches.**\n    *   This object should not appear in Output BR. Output BR at (18, 20) should be the reflection of Input BL at (18, 26-20)=(18, 6), which is Yellow (4). **Expected Output matches.**\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n*   Input TL object: Maroon (9) at (5, 4). Left half.\n    *   Output TL position (5, 4): Should match input -> Maroon (9). **Expected Output matches.**\n    *   Reflection target (TR): Output (5, 26-4) = (5, 22). Should be Maroon (9). **Expected Output matches.**\n*   Input TR object: Red (2) at (5, 20). Right half.\n    *   Should not appear in Output TL. Expected Output TL at (5, 26-20)=(5, 6) is Red (2) [from input TL]. **Expected Output matches.**\n    *   Should not appear in Output TR. Output TR at (5, 20) should be reflection of Input TL at (5, 26-20)=(5, 6), which is Red (2). **Expected Output matches.**\n\nThe metrics confirm the revised hypothesis: Copy left half, reflect left half onto right half.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
