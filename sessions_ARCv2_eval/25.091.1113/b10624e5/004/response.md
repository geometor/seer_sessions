**Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the grid structure, axes, and the presence of objects. The first code attempt implemented a simple horizontal reflection across the entire grid's central vertical axis. The results showed this was incorrect because the output grids in the examples do not preserve the original objects from the right half of the input; instead, the left half of the output matches the left half of the input, and the right half of the output is a reflection of the left half of the input.

The strategy is to revise the transformation rule:
1.  The output grid should first replicate the left half of the input grid (including the central vertical axis).
2.  The right half of the output grid should then be populated by reflecting the content of the *input* grid's left half across the central vertical axis.
3.  The original content of the input grid's right half is effectively discarded.

**Metrics**

To confirm the revised hypothesis, let's trace key points:

*   **Grid Dimensions:** Both examples use 27x27 grids. Width = 27.
*   **Vertical Axis:** Column 13 (index).
*   **Horizontal Axis:** Row 13 (index).
*   **Reflection Rule:** Output(r, c) = Input(r, 26 - c)
*   **Left Half:** Columns 0-12.
*   **Right Half:** Columns 14-26.

**Example 1 Analysis:**
*   Input TL object: Azure (8) at (4, 5). Left half.
    *   Output TL position (4, 5): Should match input -> Azure (8). **Expected Output matches.**
    *   Reflection target (TR): Output (4, 26-5) = (4, 21). Should be Azure (8). **Expected Output matches.**
*   Input TR object: Red (2) at (5, 20). Right half.
    *   This object should not appear in Output TL. Expected Output TL at (5, 26-20) = (5, 6) is Yellow (4). **Expected Output matches.**
    *   This object should not appear in Output TR. Output TR at (5, 20) should be the reflection of Input TL at (5, 26-20)=(5, 6), which is Azure (8). **Expected Output matches.**
*   Input BL object: Red (2) at (20, 3). Left half.
    *   Output BL position (20, 3): Should match input -> Red (2). **Expected Output matches.**
    *   Reflection target (BR): Output (20, 26-3) = (20, 23). Should be Red (2). **Expected Output matches.**
*   Input BR object: Red (2) at (18, 20). Right half.
    *   This object should not appear in Output BL. Expected Output BL at (18, 26-20) = (18, 6) is Yellow (4). **Expected Output matches.**
    *   This object should not appear in Output BR. Output BR at (18, 20) should be the reflection of Input BL at (18, 26-20)=(18, 6), which is Yellow (4). **Expected Output matches.**

**Example 2 Analysis:**
*   Input TL object: Maroon (9) at (5, 4). Left half.
    *   Output TL position (5, 4): Should match input -> Maroon (9). **Expected Output matches.**
    *   Reflection target (TR): Output (5, 26-4) = (5, 22). Should be Maroon (9). **Expected Output matches.**
*   Input TR object: Red (2) at (5, 20). Right half.
    *   Should not appear in Output TL. Expected Output TL at (5, 26-20)=(5, 6) is Red (2) [from input TL]. **Expected Output matches.**
    *   Should not appear in Output TR. Output TR at (5, 20) should be reflection of Input TL at (5, 26-20)=(5, 6), which is Red (2). **Expected Output matches.**

The metrics confirm the revised hypothesis: Copy left half, reflect left half onto right half.

**Facts**


```yaml
grid_properties:
  - width: 27
  - height: 27
  - background_color: 4 # yellow (predominant, but can be overwritten)
  - axes:
      - orientation: vertical
        color: 1 # blue
        index: 13 # zero-based column index (center_col)
      - orientation: horizontal
        color: 1 # blue
        index: 13 # zero-based row index (center_row)
  - width_minus_1: 26 # Useful constant for reflection calculation

objects:
  - description: Contiguous or complex patterns of pixels with colors other than the primary background (yellow, 4) or main axes (blue, 1).
  - location: Present in all four quadrants in the input grids.

transformation:
  - type: Partial Copy and Reflection
  - axis_of_reflection: Vertical axis at index 13
  - rule:
      1. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input.
      2. Copy the left half of the input grid (columns 0 through 13, inclusive) directly to the left half of the output grid (columns 0 through 13).
      3. For the right half of the output grid (columns 14 through 26), populate each cell (row, col) with the value from the input grid at cell (row, 26 - col). This effectively reflects the input grid's columns 0 through 12 onto the output grid's columns 26 down to 14.
  - invariant_elements:
      - Grid dimensions
      - The content of the left half of the grid (columns 0-13) is preserved from input to output.
  - variant_elements:
      - The content of the right half of the grid (columns 14-26) is completely replaced by a reflection of the input's left half. The original content of the input's right half is discarded.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the width of the input grid. Let this be `width`. Calculate `width_minus_1 = width - 1`.
2.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  Iterate through each row `r` from 0 to `height - 1`.
4.  Iterate through each column `c` from 0 to `width - 1`.
5.  Get the color value from the input grid at `(r, c)`. Let this be `input_color`.
6.  If the current column `c` is less than or equal to the central column index (`width // 2`, which is 13 for width 27):
    a.  Place the `input_color` into the output grid at the same position `(r, c)`.
7.  Calculate the reflected column index `c_reflected = width_minus_1 - c`.
8.  If the reflected column `c_reflected` is greater than the central column index (13):
    a.  Place the `input_color` (which came from the left side or center, `c <= 13`) into the output grid at the reflected position `(r, c_reflected)`.
9.  Return the completed output grid.

*(Self-correction: The loops can be simplified. We can process the left side copy and the right side reflection in two stages or structure the loop differently)*

**Revised Natural Language Program (Simpler Logic):**

1.  Determine the width (`width`) and height (`height`) of the input grid. Calculate the central column index `center_col = width // 2`. Calculate `width_minus_1 = width - 1`.
2.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions, initially filled with a placeholder or copied from the input.
3.  **Copy Left Half:** Iterate through rows `r` from 0 to `height - 1` and columns `c` from 0 to `center_col` (inclusive). Set `output_grid[r][c] = input_grid[r][c]`.
4.  **Reflect Left onto Right Half:** Iterate through rows `r` from 0 to `height - 1` and columns `c` from 0 to `center_col - 1` (exclusive of the center column). Calculate the target reflected column `c_reflected = width_minus_1 - c`. Set `output_grid[r][c_reflected] = input_grid[r][c]`.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
