**General Assessment**

The initial analysis correctly identified the transformation as a horizontal reflection across the central vertical axis. However, the code implementation incorrectly assigned the pixel values during the reflection. Instead of assigning `output[row, col] = input[row, reflected_col]`, the code assigned `output[row, reflected_col] = input[row, col]`. This resulted in an incorrect transformation, as evidenced by the mismatches in the training examples.

The strategy is to correct the implementation logic to match the intended reflection rule derived from observing the input/output pairs. The core rule is that the pixel value at a given coordinate `(r, c)` in the output grid corresponds to the pixel value at the horizontally mirrored coordinate `(r, width - 1 - c)` in the input grid.

**Metrics**

| Example   | Input Dimensions | Output Dimensions | Axis Column Index | Axis Row Index | Correctly Transformed (Previous Code) | Pixels Off (Previous Code) |
| :-------- | :--------------- | :---------------- | :---------------- | :------------- | :------------------------------------ | :------------------------- |
| train\_1 | 27x27            | 27x27             | 13                | 13             | False                                 | 60                         |
| train\_2 | 27x27            | 27x27             | 13                | 13             | False                                 | 74                         |

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
grid_properties:
  - width: 27
  - height: 27
  - background_color: 4 # yellow
  - axes:
      - orientation: vertical
        color: 1 # blue
        index: 13 # zero-based column index (center)
      - orientation: horizontal
        color: 1 # blue
        index: 13 # zero-based row index (center)

objects:
  - description: Contiguous areas or patterns of pixels with colors other than the background (yellow, 4) or axes (blue, 1).
  - location: Distributed across the grid, primarily off the main axes.
  - properties: Vary in shape, size, and color composition between examples.

transformation:
  - type: reflection
  - axis_of_reflection: vertical
  - axis_location: column 13 (zero-based index, width / 2)
  - rule: The pixel value at output coordinate (row, col) is determined by the pixel value at input coordinate (row, width - 1 - col).
  - invariant_elements:
      - Grid dimensions
      - Central vertical blue axis (col 13) maps onto itself.
      # Note: The horizontal blue axis (row 13) also appears invariant,
      # but this is a consequence of the horizontal reflection rule applied to it,
      # not a separate rule preserving it.
      # output[13, c] = input[13, width - 1 - c]. Since input[13, x] is always 1 (blue),
      # the output row 13 remains blue.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the dimensions (height `H`, width `W`) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions (`H`x`W`).
3.  For each cell in the output grid, identified by its `row` index `r` (from 0 to `H-1`) and `column` index `c` (from 0 to `W-1`):
    a.  Calculate the corresponding source column index in the input grid: `source_c = W - 1 - c`.
    b.  Get the color value from the input grid at position `(r, source_c)`.
    c.  Place this color value into the output grid at position `(r, c)`.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
