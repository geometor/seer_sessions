grid_properties:
  - width: 27
  - height: 27
  - background_color: 4 # yellow
  - axes:
      - orientation: vertical
        color: 1 # blue
        index: 13 # zero-based column index (center)
      - orientation: horizontal
        color: 1 # blue
        index: 13 # zero-based row index (center)

objects:
  - description: Contiguous areas or patterns of pixels with colors other than the background (yellow, 4) or axes (blue, 1).
  - location: Distributed across the grid, primarily off the main axes.
  - properties: Vary in shape, size, and color composition between examples.

transformation:
  - type: reflection
  - axis_of_reflection: vertical
  - axis_location: column 13 (zero-based index, width / 2)
  - rule: The pixel value at output coordinate (row, col) is determined by the pixel value at input coordinate (row, width - 1 - col).
  - invariant_elements:
      - Grid dimensions
      - Central vertical blue axis (col 13) maps onto itself.
      # Note: The horizontal blue axis (row 13) also appears invariant,
      # but this is a consequence of the horizontal reflection rule applied to it,
      # not a separate rule preserving it.
      # output[13, c] = input[13, width - 1 - c]. Since input[13, x] is always 1 (blue),
      # the output row 13 remains blue.
