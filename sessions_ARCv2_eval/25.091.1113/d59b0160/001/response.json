Find all non-background pixels (any color other than 7) that are located on the grid's border (top/bottom row, left/right column).\n3. Starting from these border non-background pixels, perform a search (e.g., Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) to identify all other non-background pixels that are connected to them through a path of adjacent (including diagonals) non-background pixels. Mark these reachable pixels as \"border-connected\".\n4. Create the output grid by initially copying the input grid.\n5. Iterate through every pixel in the input grid. If a pixel is non-background AND it was *not* marked as \"border-connected\" in step 3, change its color in the output grid to the background color (orange, 7).\n6. Pixels that were originally the background color or were non-background but marked as \"border-connected\" retain their original color in the output grid.\n7. Return the modified output grid.\n\nEssentially, the transformation preserves non-background pixels (and shapes formed by them) that touch or are connected to the grid's border, while removing (filling with background color) any non-background pixels or shapes completely surrounded by the background color.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by removing non-background pixels that are not connected \n    to the grid border via a path of other non-background pixels.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of list of int): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of list of int: The transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for efficient operations\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_np = np.copy(input_np)\n    H, W = input_np.shape\n    bg_color = 7\n\n    # Set to store coordinates of non-background pixels connected to the border\n    connected_pixels = set()\n    # Queue for BFS\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Initialize the search with non-background pixels on the border\n    for r in range(H):\n        for c in range(W):\n            if r == 0 or r == H - 1 or c == 0 or c == W - 1:\n                if input_np[r, c] != bg_color and (r, c) not in connected_pixels:\n                    connected_pixels.add((r, c))\n                    queue.append((r, c))\n\n    # Perform BFS to find all connected non-background pixels\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Check 8 neighbors (including diagonals)\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                    continue # Skip self\n\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n\n                # Check boundaries\n                if 0 <= nr < H and 0 <= nc < W:\n                    # Check if neighbor is non-background and not already visited/connected\n                    if input_np[nr, nc] != bg_color and (nr, nc) not in connected_pixels:\n                        connected_pixels.add((nr, nc))\n                        queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    # Iterate through the grid and change non-connected non-background pixels to background\n    for r in range(H):\n        for c in range(W):\n            # If a pixel is not background AND it's not in the connected set\n            if input_np[r, c] != bg_color and (r, c) not in connected_pixels:\n                # Change it to background color in the output grid\n                output_np[r, c] = bg_color\n\n    # Convert numpy array back to list of lists\n    output_grid = output_np.tolist()\n    return output_grid\n```"
