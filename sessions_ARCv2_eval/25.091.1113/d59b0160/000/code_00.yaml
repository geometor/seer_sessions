task_context:
  grid_size: 16x16 (consistent across examples)
  background_color: 7 (orange)
  primary_action: Selective color replacement

elements:
  - type: pixel_group
    description: Contiguous regions of non-background pixels (colors 0-6, 8-9).
    properties:
      - color: Various (non-orange)
      - connectivity: Can be connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
      - location: Can be anywhere in the grid.
      - relationship_to_border: A group can touch the grid border or be fully internal.

transformation:
  - operation: identify_background
    description: Determine the background color (orange, 7).
  - operation: identify_target_pixels
    description: Find all pixels that are not the background color.
  - operation: connectivity_analysis
    source: Grid border
    path_constraint: Path must consist only of non-background pixels.
    connectivity_type: Adjacency (including diagonals)
    goal: Identify all non-background pixels reachable from the border via a path of non-background pixels. Let's call these "border_connected" pixels.
  - operation: apply_change
    target: Non-background pixels that are *not* border_connected.
    action: Change the color of these pixels to the background color (orange, 7).
    condition: Pixel is non-background AND not border_connected.
  - operation: preserve_pixels
    target: Background pixels AND non-background pixels that *are* border_connected.
    action: Keep their original color.

input_output_relationship:
  - description: The output grid is derived from the input grid by replacing isolated non-background pixels (those not connected to the border via other non-background pixels) with the background color. Pixels connected to the border retain their original color.
