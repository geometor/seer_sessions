White pixels (color 0) act as separators and are never triggers or targets.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Iterate through each column index `c` from left to right (0 to width-1).\n    3.  For the current column `c`, iterate through each row index `r` from top to bottom (0 to height-2, as we need to look at the pixel below).\n    4.  Let `trigger_pixel_color` be the color of the pixel at `(r, c)`.\n    5.  Let `pixel_below_color` be the color of the pixel at `(r+1, c)`.\n    6.  Check if `trigger_pixel_color` is not white (0), `pixel_below_color` is not white (0), and `trigger_pixel_color` is different from `pixel_below_color`.\n    7.  If all conditions in step 6 are true:\n        a.  Identify the contiguous vertical segment of `pixel_below_color` starting at `(r+1, c)` and extending downwards. Let this segment run from row `r+1` to row `k`.\n        b.  Change the color of all pixels in the output grid from `(r+1, c)` down to `(k, c)` to `trigger_pixel_color`.\n        c.  Since the change propagates downwards, potentially modifying pixels we would have checked later in this column, advance the row iterator `r` to `k` to avoid re-processing the just-modified segment or incorrectly triggering off a newly changed pixel. (Alternatively, simply continue the loop from `r+1` after modification, assuming only one such trigger-target interaction per column matters based on examples, or that modified pixels cannot act as new triggers). *Correction based on thought process re-evaluation: Modifying the grid in place and continuing the scan from `r+1` correctly handles the examples.*\n    8.  After iterating through all rows in the current column, move to the next column.\n    9.  Once all columns are processed, return the modified output grid."
