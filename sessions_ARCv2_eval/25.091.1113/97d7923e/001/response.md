"""
This transformation modifies vertical segments in a grid based on the color of the pixel directly above them.

The rule operates independently on each column.
1. Iterate through each column of the input grid.
2. For each column, iterate through the rows from top to bottom, checking each pixel (r, c) and the one directly below it (r+1, c).
3. Identify a "trigger" pixel at (r, c) if its color (C1) is not white (0).
4. Identify a potential "target" segment starting at (r+1, c) if its color (C2) is not white (0) and C1 is different from C2.
5. If such a trigger and potential target start are found:
    a. Determine the full extent of the contiguous vertical segment of color C2 starting at (r+1, c) and extending downwards. Let this segment end at row k.
    b. In the output grid, change the color of all pixels in this segment, from row r+1 to row k in column c, to the trigger color C1.
6. Pixels not part of a segment modified this way retain their original color. White pixels (0) act as boundaries and are never triggers or targets.
7. The process continues iterating through the rows and columns. Modifications are made to a copy of the grid, ensuring that the original pixel colors are used for subsequent checks within the same column scan.
