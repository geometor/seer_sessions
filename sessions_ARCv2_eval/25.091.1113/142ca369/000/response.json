Some objects are single pixels, while others form simple shapes like lines or 'L' shapes.\n\nThe output grids show the original objects from the input grid, plus additional colored pixels forming diagonal lines. These lines originate from each of the non-white pixels present in the input grid. Each line extends downwards and to the right, maintaining the color of the originating pixel. The lines continue until they reach either the bottom edge or the right edge of the grid. The final output grid appears to be a superposition of the original input grid and these newly generated diagonal paths.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
