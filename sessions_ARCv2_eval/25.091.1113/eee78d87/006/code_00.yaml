task_context:
  description: Creates a patterned 16x16 output grid based on the input grid's colors. The background pattern depends on the minority color, and a fixed shape is overlaid if the input contains more than one color.
  input_grid_size: Variable (6x6 in examples)
  output_grid_size: Fixed (16x16)

elements:
  - element: input_grid
    properties:
      - colors: Contains a dominant background color (D) and potentially one minority color type (M).
      - dominant_color: The color that appears most frequently.
      - minority_color: The color that appears less frequently (if any). Assume only one type based on examples.
      - is_monochromatic: Boolean flag indicating if only one color exists.

  - element: output_grid
    properties:
      - size: 16x16
      - background_pattern:
          description: A grid pattern determined by the dominant input color (D), the minority input color (M), and white (0).
          rule_depends_on: minority_color (M)
          pattern_A: Cell (r, c) is 0 if r % 3 == 0 or c % 3 == 0, otherwise it is D. (Used when M=3 or M is None)
          pattern_B: Cell (r, c) is D if r % 3 == 0 or c % 3 == 0, otherwise it is 0. (Used when M=1)
          pattern_C: Cell (r, c) follows Pattern A if (c // 3) is even, follows Pattern B if (c // 3) is odd. (Used when M=6)
      - overlay_shape:
          description: A fixed shape made of maroon (9) pixels, overlaid only if the input is not monochromatic.
          shape_name: Blocky 'H'
          color: Maroon (9)
          coordinates: Fixed set [(5, 6), (5, 9), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (9, 10), (10, 6), (10, 9)]
          condition: Applied only if `is_monochromatic` is false.

actions:
  - action: analyze_input_colors
    input: input_grid
    output: dominant_color (D), minority_color (M), is_monochromatic
    description: Find the most frequent color (D), identify the less frequent color (M, if any), and determine if the grid has only one color.

  - action: select_and_create_background_grid
    input: dominant_color (D), minority_color (M)
    output: initial_output_grid (16x16)
    description: Generate a 16x16 grid using Pattern A if M=3 or M is None; Pattern B if M=1; Pattern C if M=6.

  - action: conditionally_overlay_H_shape
    input: initial_output_grid, is_monochromatic
    output: final_output_grid
    description: If `is_monochromatic` is false, change the pixels at the predefined 'H' coordinates in the initial_output_grid to maroon (9). Otherwise, return the initial_output_grid unchanged.

relationships:
  - relationship: background_pattern_determination
    from: input_grid (dominant color D, minority color M)
    to: output_grid (selection and application of Pattern A, B, or C)
  - relationship: overlay_trigger
    from: input_grid (is_monochromatic flag)
    to: output_grid (conditional inclusion of the maroon 'H' overlay)
