Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Background:** Both input and output grids feature a consistent checkerboard pattern using white (0) and blue (1) pixels. This pattern forms the background canvas.
2.  **Foreground Objects/Pixels:** Scattered within the checkerboard are pixels of other colors: azure (8) and green (3) in the first example, and red (2), green (3), and yellow (4) in the second. These appear as individual pixels or small clusters.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves certain foreground colors "projecting" or "radiating" diagonally from their original positions. The background checkerboard pattern is overwritten by this projection, but only where the projection path encounters background pixels.
4.  **Color-Specific Behavior:**
    *   **Green (3):** Pixels of this color appear static; they remain in their original positions in the output and do not project. They also act as barriers, stopping the projection of other colors.
    *   **Azure (8) and Yellow (4):** These colors project diagonally downwards and to the left (row increases, column decreases).
    *   **Red (2):** This color projects diagonally upwards and to the left (row decreases, column decreases).
5.  **Projection Rules:**
    *   Projection originates from the location of each source pixel (azure, yellow, red) in the *input* grid.
    *   The projection ray continues in its specific diagonal direction, step by step.
    *   At each step, the target cell is checked in the *input* grid:
        *   If the target cell is outside the grid boundaries, the projection stops.
        *   If the target cell contains *any* non-background color (anything other than white-0 or blue-1) in the *input* grid, the projection stops *before* reaching that cell.
        *   If the target cell contains a background color (white-0 or blue-1) in the *input* grid, that cell in the *output* grid is colored with the projecting color.
6.  **Output Construction:** The output grid starts as a copy of the input. Then, the background cells along the valid projection paths are colored according to the rules above. Original non-background pixels (including the sources and static green pixels) retain their positions and colors.

**Facts**

      Foreground pixels present in the input grid block the diagonal projection
      of other colors if they lie on the projection path.

    input: source_pixel (coordinate, color), input_grid, output_grid
    condition: color is red, yellow, or azure
    effect: >
      Modifies output_grid by coloring background pixels along a diagonal path
      starting from the source_pixel's location + 1 step, according to color-specific direction.
      Projection stops at grid boundary or when the next cell in the path corresponds
      to a non-background pixel in the input_grid.
    parameters:
      direction:
        red: up-left (dr=-1, dc=-1)
        yellow: down-left (dr=+1, dc=-1)
        azure: down-left (dr=+1, dc=-1)
rules:
  - >
    Static pixels (green) remain unchanged in the output grid and act as obstacles.
  - >
    Projecting pixels (red, yellow, azure) remain unchanged in the output grid
    but also generate projection rays.
  - >
    Projection only overwrites pixels that were originally background colors (white or blue).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all non-background pixels (colors other than white-0 and blue-1) in the input grid. Store their locations (row, column) and colors. These are potential sources and obstacles.
3.  Iterate through each identified non-background pixel (let's call it the `source_pixel`) from the input grid.
4.  Determine the projection behavior based on the `source_pixel`'s color:
    *   If the color is green (3), do nothing further for this pixel (it's static).
    *   If the color is red (2), set the projection direction to up-left (change in row = -1, change in column = -1).
    *   If the color is yellow (4) or azure (8), set the projection direction to down-left (change in row = +1, change in column = -1).
5.  If the `source_pixel`'s color requires projection (red, yellow, or azure):
    a.  Initialize the current position `(curr_row, curr_col)` to the `source_pixel`'s location.
    b.  Start a loop for projection steps:
        i.  Calculate the next position `(next_row, next_col)` by adding the determined directional changes to `(curr_row, curr_col)`.
        ii. Check boundary conditions: If `next_row` or `next_col` is outside the grid dimensions, stop the projection loop for this `source_pixel`.
        iii. Check for obstacles: Look up the color of the cell at `(next_row, next_col)` in the *original input grid*. If this color is *not* white (0) and *not* blue (1), stop the projection loop for this `source_pixel`.
        iv. If the checks pass (within bounds and the target cell in the input is background), update the *output grid* at `(next_row, next_col)` with the `source_pixel`'s color.
        v.  Update the current position: `curr_row = next_row`, `curr_col = next_col`.
        vi. Continue the loop (go back to step 5.b.i).
6.  After iterating through all initial non-background pixels, the modified output grid is the final result.

**Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code failed because its interpretation of the projection rule was slightly incorrect. It stopped projection whenever the next cell in the *input* grid contained *any* non-background color. The analysis of the discrepancies between the expected and transformed outputs revealed that projection should only be stopped by grid boundaries or by encountering a *specific* static obstacle color (green-3) in the input grid. Projections *can* pass through the original location of other *projecting* colors (red-2, yellow-4, azure-8), but only color the output cell if that cell was originally a background color (white-0 or blue-1).

The strategy is to modify the projection logic:
1.  Identify all non-background source pixels in the input.
2.  For each source pixel, determine its projection direction (or lack thereof for green).
3.  Trace the projection path step-by-step diagonally.
4.  At each step, check for stopping conditions:
    *   Is the next position outside the grid? -> Stop projection.
    *   Does the input grid at the next position contain green (3)? -> Stop projection.
5.  If projection does not stop, check if the input grid at the next position contains a background color (0 or 1). If yes, update the corresponding cell in the *output* grid with the projecting color.
6.  Continue tracing the projection path from the new position, regardless of whether the cell was colored or not in the previous step (unless a stop condition was met).

**Metrics**

Based on the previous execution results:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Match: False
    *   Pixels Off: 14
    *   Cause: Projection stopped prematurely when the path encountered the original location of *any* non-background pixel in the input, instead of only stopping for green (3) pixels or grid boundaries. Cells that should have been colored by projection (because they were background in the input and not blocked by green) remained as background.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Match: False
    *   Pixels Off: 50
    *   Cause: Same as Example 1. Both red (up-left) and yellow (down-left) projections were shorter than expected because they were incorrectly blocked by other red/yellow/azure pixels in the input grid along their paths.

  - name: copy_grid
    input: input_grid
    output: initial_output_grid
  - name: identify_sources
    input: input_grid
    output: list of coordinates and colors for non-background pixels

    condition: color is red, yellow, or azure
    effect: >
      Iteratively checks cells along a diagonal path starting from the source_pixel's location.
      Modifies the output_grid by coloring a cell if:
      1. The cell is within grid boundaries.
      2. The corresponding cell in the input_grid is NOT green (3).
      3. The corresponding cell in the input_grid IS a background color (0 or 1).
      The projection continues until boundaries are hit or a green (3) pixel is encountered in the input_grid along the path.
    parameters:
      direction:
        red: up-left (dr=-1, dc=-1)
        yellow: down-left (dr=+1, dc=-1)
        azure: down-left (dr=+1, dc=-1)
rules:
  - >
    Static pixels (green) remain unchanged in the output grid and act as projection obstacles based on their input grid position.
  - >
    Projecting pixels (red, yellow, azure) remain unchanged in the output grid
    and generate projection rays based on their input grid position. They do not block projections from other sources.
  - >
    Projection only overwrites pixels in the output grid if the corresponding pixel in the input grid was a background color (white or blue).
  - >
    The path of projection continues as long as it is within bounds and does not encounter a green (3) pixel in the input grid, even if it passes over locations that originally held other projecting pixels or non-background colors that aren't green.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Define the set of background colors: white (0) and blue (1).
3.  Define the static obstacle color: green (3).
4.  Define the projecting colors and their directions:
    *   Red (2): Up-left (row change -1, column change -1)
    *   Yellow (4): Down-left (row change +1, column change -1)
    *   Azure (8): Down-left (row change +1, column change -1)
5.  Identify all pixels in the *input grid* that are not background colors. Store their locations (row, column) and colors.
6.  Iterate through each identified non-background pixel (the `source_pixel`) from step 5.
7.  If the `source_pixel`'s color is green (3), do nothing further for this pixel and proceed to the next one.
8.  If the `source_pixel`'s color is one of the projecting colors (red, yellow, or azure):
    a.  Determine the row change (`dr`) and column change (`dc`) based on the color's projection direction.
    b.  Initialize the current position `(curr_row, curr_col)` to the `source_pixel`'s location `(r, c)`.
    c.  Start a loop to trace the projection path:
        i.  Calculate the next potential position `(next_row, next_col)` by adding `(dr, dc)` to `(curr_row, curr_col)`.
        ii. Check boundary conditions: If `next_row` or `next_col` is outside the grid dimensions, stop the projection loop for this `source_pixel`.
        iii. Check for static obstacle: Look up the color of the cell at `(next_row, next_col)` in the *original input grid*. If this color is green (3), stop the projection loop for this `source_pixel`.
        iv. Check if the target cell was originally background: If the color of the cell at `(next_row, next_col)` in the *original input grid* is one of the background colors (0 or 1), then update the *output grid* at `(next_row, next_col)` to be the `source_pixel`'s color.
        v.  Update the current position for the next iteration: `curr_row = next_row`, `curr_col = next_col`.
        vi. Continue the loop (go back to step 8.c.i).
9.  After iterating through all initial non-background pixels, the potentially modified output grid is the final result.
