Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2. Identify all non-background pixels (colors other than white-0 and blue-1) \n   in the input grid. These are potential sources or obstacles.\n3. Iterate through each identified non-background source pixel from the input grid.\n4. Determine the projection direction based on the source pixel's color:\n    - Red (2): Projects diagonally up-left (row decreases, column decreases).\n    - Yellow (4) and Azure (8): Project diagonally down-left (row increases, column decreases).\n    - Green (3): Does not project; it's static but acts as an obstacle.\n5. For projecting colors (Red, Yellow, Azure):\n    a. Start from the cell diagonally adjacent to the source pixel in the determined direction.\n    b. Continue projecting step-by-step in the same diagonal direction.\n    c. At each step, check the corresponding cell in the *original input grid*:\n        i. If the cell is outside the grid boundaries, stop projection.\n        ii. If the cell contains a non-background color (any color except 0 or 1), \n           stop projection *before* coloring this cell.\n        iii. If the cell contains a background color (0 or 1), color the \n            corresponding cell in the *output grid* with the source pixel's color.\n    d. Update the current position and repeat step 5.c.\n6. Pixels that are sources of projection or static (green) retain their original \n   color and position in the output grid.\n7.
