            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial hypothesis that the transformation is triggered by black pixels (0) completely surrounded by blue pixels (1) was incorrect. The code based on this hypothesis failed on all training examples, indicating a fundamental misunderstanding of the trigger condition. The discrepancies show that the transformation occurs around some black pixels that have black neighbors and sometimes occurs even at the grid edges.\n\nThe strategy is to re-evaluate the properties of the black pixels that *do* cause the transformation versus those that do not. By comparing the local neighborhood (specifically looking for patterns involving adjacent black pixels) of triggering and non-triggering black pixels across all examples, a new hypothesis was formed: the transformation is triggered by any black pixel (0) that is *not* part of any 2x2 square composed entirely of black pixels. This hypothesis successfully explains the observed behavior in all training examples. The Natural Language program and YAML facts will be updated based on this revised understanding.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nTo refine the analysis, let's identify the coordinates of the triggering black pixels (those that cause the orange transformation in their neighborhood) according to the expected outputs and check if they satisfy the \"not part of a 2x2 black square\" condition.\n\n*   **Function to check for 2x2 black squares:**\n    "

            "text": "**Correction**: The code execution reveals that the \"not part of a 2x2 black square\" hypothesis is *also* incorrect.\n*   In Example 1, pixel `(5,7)` is part of a 2x2 black square (`(5,7), (6,7), (5,8), (6,8)`), so `is_part_of_2x2_black` returns `True`, meaning `not is_part_of_2x2_black` is `False`. This correctly matches the expected output (no trigger). All identified triggers correctly return `True` (not part of a 2x2).\n*   In Example 2, pixel `(3,2)` is part of a 2x2, so it correctly returns `False` (no trigger). However, pixel `(6,12)` is black but is *not* part of a 2x2 square, returning `True`. Looking at the expected output for Ex 2, there is *no* transformation around `(6,12)`. This contradicts the hypothesis.\n*   In Example 3, pixel `(3,7)` is identified as a trigger in the expected output, but the code indicates `is_part_of_2x2_black` is `True` (check `(3,7)=0, (4,7)=1, (3,8)=0, (4,8)=1`, `(3,7)=0, (2,7)=?, (3,8)=0, (2,8)=?`, `(3,7)=0, (4,7)=1, (3,6)=1, (4,6)=1`, `(3,7)=0, (2,7)=?, (3,6)=1, (2,6)=?`). Wait, the code logic for `is_part_of_2x2_black` seems flawed or my manual check was. Let's re-check `(3,7)` in Ex3: `grid[3,7]=0`.\n    1. `(3,7),(4,7),(3,8),(4,8)` -> `0, 1, 0, 1` - NO\n    2. `(3,7),(4,7),(3,6),(4,6)` -> `0, 1, 1, 1` - NO\n    3. `(3,7),(2,7),(3,8),(2,8)` -> `0, 0, 0, 0` - YES! This pixel *is* part of a 2x2 black square. The function correctly returns `True`, meaning `not is_part_of_2x2_black` is `False`. But the expected output *shows* a trigger at `(3,7)`. Hypothesis fails definitively here.\n\n**Further Refined Strategy:** The 2x2 rule failed. Let's go back to the core idea of \"isolated\" black pixels. Maybe \"isolated\" means something specific about the *neighbors*.\nLet's reconsider the very first hypothesis: \"surrounded by blue\". It only worked for one case (`(7,8)` in Ex 2). What if the rule is: **A black pixel triggers the change IF AND ONLY IF it has 8 neighbors AND all 8 neighbors are blue.** This is a stricter version. It excludes edge/corner pixels. Let's test this.\n\n*   Ex 1: `(4,8)` fails (has black neighbors). `(10,6)` fails. `(11,5)` fails. `(11,6)` fails. `(17,14)` fails. `(0,3)` fails (edge). `(2,16)` fails (edge). Only black pixels *not* on edges/corners *and* fully surrounded by blue would trigger. None exist in Ex 1 that trigger in the expected output. Hypothesis fails.\n*   Ex 2: `(7,8)` has 8 neighbors, all blue (1). **Triggers.** This matches expected. Are there others? `(6,14)` has 8 neighbors, but `(5,13)=0`, `(7,13)=0`. Fails. `(8,14)` has 8 neighbors, but `(7,13)=0`, `(8,13)=0`, `(8,15)=0`, `(9,13)=0`. Fails. `(13,6)` has 8 neighbors, but `(13,7)=0`. Fails. `(13,7)` has 8 neighbors, but `(13,6)=0`. Fails. `(0,15)` fails (edge). This hypothesis only explains the trigger at `(7,8)`. Fails overall.\n*   Ex 3: `(6,10)` has 8 neighbors, `(7,11)=0`. Fails. `(7,11)` has 8 neighbors, `(6,10)=0`. Fails. `(12,7)` has 8 neighbors, `(13,6)=0`, `(13,7)=0`, `(13,8)=0`. Fails. `(3,7)` fails (only 4 neighbors). Fails overall.\n\n**Let's rethink the \"object\" idea.** The transformation happens *near* black pixels, but maybe the trigger isn't the black pixel itself. Maybe it's a *pattern* of blue pixels?\nConsider the 3x3 orange patterns in the output. They always seem centered on a black pixel from the input.\nWhat if the rule involves the 3x3 neighborhood? Find all 3x3 squares. If the center is black (0), and *all other 8 pixels* in the 3x3 square are blue (1), then change those 8 blue pixels to orange (7).\n\n*   Test this:\n    *   Ex 1: Check `(4,8)`. Center is 0. Neighbors are not all blue. No trigger. Fails. Check `(1,3)`. Center is 1. No trigger. Check `(11,6)`. Center is 0. Neighbors not all blue. No trigger. Fails.\n    *   Ex 2: Check `(7,8)`. Center is 0. Neighbors are `(6,7)=1, (6,8)=1, (6,9)=1, (7,7)=1, (7,9)=1, (8,7)=1, (8,8)=1, (8,9)=1`. All 8 neighbors are blue! **Trigger.** Change the 8 neighbors to orange. Matches expected output at this location. Check `(1,15)`. Center is 1. No trigger. Check `(13,6)`. Center is 0. Neighbors include `(13,7)=0`. No trigger. Fails.\n    *   Ex 3: Check `(7,11)`. Center is 0. Neighbors include `(6,10)=0`. No trigger. Fails.\n\nThis hypothesis (\"center black, all 8 neighbors blue\") only worked for one specific case `(7,8)` in Ex 2. It's identical to the strict version of the first hypothesis.\n\n**Final, Final Hypothesis:** Find all 3x3 patterns in the input grid that match this specific shape:\n"

If this exact pattern is found, replace the blue (1) pixels in that pattern with orange (7) in the output grid, keeping the central black (0) pixel. *Crucially, the transformations from multiple found patterns can overlap.*\n\n*   Testing this:\n    *   Ex 1:\n        *   Does `(0,3)` center a pattern `[[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]`? Needs `(-1,2)` to `(1,4)`. Out of bounds. No match. *Still doesn't explain trigger at (0,3)*. Let's pause on edges.\n        *   Does `(4,8)` center the pattern? Input neighborhood: `[[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]`. No match. *Still doesn't explain trigger at (4,8)*.\n        *   This precise pattern match only explains the trigger at `(7,8)` in Ex 2. It fails for almost all observed triggers.\n\n**Conclusion:** There must be a different trigger condition or interaction. The consistent factor is that orange appears in the 3x3 neighborhood of *some* input black pixels, replacing blue pixels. The trigger condition remains unclear and inconsistent across the simple local hypotheses tested. Let's revert to the most plausible-seeming failed hypothesis (\"not part of 2x2 black square\") and document it, acknowledging its known flaws from the code execution check. It captured *more* of the cases than other simple hypotheses, even if flawed. The coder phase might require more sophisticated pattern analysis or graph-based approaches to find the true rule.\n\n**YAML Facts (Based on Flawed \"Not 2x2\" Hypothesis):**\n\n"

All other pixels (black pixels, non-affected blue pixels) retain their original color. Overlapping transformations are allowed (a blue pixel can be changed to orange if it's a neighbor of multiple trigger_pixels).\n```"
