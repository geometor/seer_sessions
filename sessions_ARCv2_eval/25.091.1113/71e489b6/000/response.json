The output grids introduce orange (7) pixels while retaining the original black and blue pixels, though some blue pixels change to orange.\n3.  **Key Feature:** The transformation seems centered around specific black (0) pixels in the input grid.\n4.  **Condition for Transformation:** Not all black pixels trigger a change. The black pixels that trigger the change appear to be those completely surrounded (including diagonals) by blue (1) pixels. Black pixels adjacent to other black pixels or at the grid edge do not trigger the change.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:** When a black (0) pixel meets the condition (surrounded by blue), its neighboring blue (1) pixels within the 3x3 area centered on the black pixel are changed to orange (7) in the output grid. The central black pixel itself remains black (0). The changes caused by different qualifying black pixels can overlap.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
