"""
Identify the background color and four distinct rectangular regions separated by it.
The regions are ordered left-to-right (1 to 4). Region 4 is the target, initially filled
with a single 'fill_color'. Region 2 is Source A, Region 3 is Source B.
Create the output grid by copying the input.
Iterate through each cell location relative to the region boundaries.
For each relative location (rel_row, rel_col):
  - Get the color 'colorA' from the corresponding location in Source A (Region 2).
  - Get the color 'colorB' from the corresponding location in Source B (Region 3).
  - Get the target location in Region 4 of the output grid.
  - If colorA is different from the 'fill_color', set the target location to colorA.
  - Else if colorB is different from the 'fill_color', set the target location to colorB.
  - Otherwise, the target location retains the 'fill_color'.
The fill_color is determined by the initial color filling Region 4.
Patterns in Region 2 and Region 3 are defined as pixels not matching this fill_color.
