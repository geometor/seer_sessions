    identifier: 3x3_square
    properties:
      - border_pixels: The 8 outer pixels of the 3x3 square.
      - center_pixel: The pixel at the center of the 3x3 square.
      - border_color: The single color shared by all 8 border_pixels.
      - center_color: The color of the center_pixel, must be different from border_color.
      - internal_pixels: All 9 pixels within the 3x3 square.
    subtypes:
      - name: standard_object
        condition: All internal_pixels have either the border_color or the center_color.
      - name: non_standard_object
        condition: At least one internal_pixel has a color different from both border_color and center_color.
actions:
  - name: remove_object
    target: 3x3_square object
    effect: Replace all 9 internal_pixels with the background_color (white).
  - name: modify_center
    target: center_pixel of a standard_object
    effect: Change the center_pixel's color to a new_color.
    dependency: The new_color depends on the specific pair of (border_color, center_color).
relationships:
  - type: rule
    condition: If a 3x3_square is a non_standard_object.
    action: remove_object.
  - type: rule_set
    condition: If a 3x3_square is a standard_object.
    action: Depends on the specific (border_color, center_color) pair.
