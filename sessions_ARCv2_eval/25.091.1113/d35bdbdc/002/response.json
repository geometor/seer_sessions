            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial code successfully processed examples `train_2` and `train_3` but failed on `train_1`. The failure occurred because a specific 3x3 object (yellow border, red center) present in `train_1` was expected to be removed (replaced with white), but the derived rules did not include a removal condition for this specific combination.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Re-examine all training examples to comprehensively map the input 3x3 object patterns (border color, center color, presence of extra colors) to their corresponding output transformations (removal, center modification, or no change).\n2.  Identify the missing rule(s) by analyzing the failed example (`train_1`) and confirming consistency across all examples.\n3.  Update the rule sets (`REMOVAL_PAIRS`, `MODIFICATION_RULES`) used by the code.\n4.  Refine the YAML facts and the natural language program to accurately reflect the complete set of observed rules. The core logic of identifying 3x3 objects and the two-pass (remove then modify) approach appears sound, but the specific rules governing the transformations need correction.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's analyze the specific 3x3 objects in each example. A 3x3 object is defined as having 8 border pixels of the same color (`BorderColor`) and a center pixel of a different color (`CenterColor`). We also note if any of the 9 pixels have a color different from both `BorderColor` and `CenterColor` (`HasExtraColor`).\n\n"
