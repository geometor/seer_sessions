            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are relatively large (20x20) and mostly composed of the background color, white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** Within the white background, there are distinct shapes or patterns formed by non-white pixels (colors 1 through 9). These appear to be the primary focus.\n3.  **Multiple Objects:** In some inputs, there might be several disconnected groups of non-white pixels. For example, in `train_1`, besides the main central pattern, there are isolated azure pixels and a green/magenta pair near the bottom.\n4.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are smaller than the input grids and contain only one main object, seemingly extracted from the input. The output grid's size corresponds exactly to the dimensions of this extracted object.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be identifying the \"most significant\" object in the input grid and cropping the grid to the minimal bounding box containing just that object.\n6.  **Significance Criteria:** Comparing the central objects with the smaller, isolated groups of pixels, the central objects are significantly larger in terms of the number of pixels they contain. This suggests the \"most significant\" object is the one with the largest area (pixel count).\n7.  **Connectivity:** The pixels forming the main object are connected, often including diagonal connections (8-way connectivity).\n8.  **Color Preservation:** The colors of the pixels within the extracted object remain unchanged in the output.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
