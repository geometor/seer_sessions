            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code successfully identified the core concepts: finding blue shapes, creating a border, and conditionally filling the interior based on the presence of holes. However, the execution results reveal inaccuracies, primarily in correctly identifying and filling the \"hole\" pixels (originally yellow, enclosed by blue, becoming magenta '6') and distinguishing them from border pixels (originally yellow, adjacent to blue, becoming red '2').\n\nThe failures occur consistently where holes are present. In examples 1 and 2, the transformed output incorrectly colors some expected magenta (6) pixels as red (2) or azure (8). In example 3, a smaller hole region is misidentified. This points to a flaw in the logic that determines:\n1.  Which yellow pixels constitute a \"hole\".\n2.  Which specific blue shape encloses a given hole.\n3.  How to handle pixels that are both adjacent to a blue shape (potential border) *and* part of a hole.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Hole Identification:** The current method identifies all yellow pixels not reachable from the exterior (`all_hole_pixels`). This is a good start.\n2.  **Refine Hole Association:** Instead of associating holes based purely on adjacency (`shape_adjacent_holes`), we need a more robust method. For each identified `hole_pixel`, determine which blue shape surrounds it. A flood fill starting from a hole pixel, restricted to other hole pixels, could identify the entire connected hole region. Then, examine the pixels *immediately* surrounding this hole region. If all surrounding non-hole, non-background pixels belong to the *same* blue shape component, that shape encloses the hole.\n3.  **Refine Border vs. Hole Filling:** The order of operations and conditions needs adjustment.\n    *   Identify all blue shapes (`shape_pixels`).\n    *   Identify all exterior yellow pixels (`exterior_yellow`).\n    *   Identify all interior yellow pixels (`hole_pixels`).\n    *   Determine which shapes enclose which holes.\n    *   Initialize the output grid.\n    *   Fill hole pixels with magenta (6).\n    *   Fill shape pixels (azure 8 if holes, blue 1 if not).\n    *   Fill border pixels: Iterate through neighbors of original `shape_pixels`. If a neighbor is `exterior_yellow`, color it red (2) in the output. *Do not* overwrite magenta hole pixels.\n    *   Copy remaining `exterior_yellow` pixels.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's analyze the differences for the failed examples using the provided outputs.\n\n**Example 1 Failure Analysis:**\n\n*   **Input Shape 1 (Top Left):** Has holes. Expected fill: azure (8), magenta (6).\n*   **Input Shape 2 (Bottom Middle):** No holes. Expected fill: blue (1).\n*   **Input Shape 3 (Top Right):** Has holes. Expected fill: azure (8), magenta (6).\n*   **Incorrect Pixels:** The errors are concentrated in the hole areas of Shape 1 and Shape 3.\n    *   Shape 1 Hole Pixels (Expected 6): `(4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 7), (5, 8)`. Code Output: `(4,7)=2, (4,8)=2, (5,7)=2, (5,8)=2`. These seem to be border pixels incorrectly prioritized over hole pixels.\n    *   Shape 3 Hole Pixels (Expected 6): `(2, 17), (2, 18), (2, 19)`, `(3, 17), (3, 18), (3, 19)`, `(4, 17), (4, 18), (4, 19)`. Code Output: `(2,17)=2, (2,18)=2, (2,19)=2`, `(3,17)=2, (3,18)=6, (3,19)=2`, `(4,17)=2, (4,18)=2, (4,19)=2`. Only one pixel `(3,18)` was correctly identified as a hole. Others were likely overwritten by the border logic or misclassified.\n\n**Example 2 Failure Analysis:**\n\n*   **Input Shape 1 (Top Left):** No holes. Expected fill: blue (1).\n*   **Input Shape 2 (Top Middle):** Has holes. Expected fill: azure (8), magenta (6).\n*   **Input Shape 3 (Top Right):** Has holes. Expected fill: azure (8), magenta (6).\n*   **Input Shape 4 (Middle Left):** No holes. Expected fill: blue (1).\n*   **Input Shape 5 (Middle Right):** No holes. Expected fill: blue (1).\n*   **Input Shape 6 (Bottom Left):** No holes. Expected fill: blue (1).\n*   **Input Shape 7 (Bottom Right):** No holes. Expected fill: blue (1).\n*   **Incorrect Pixels:** Errors are in the hole area of Shape 3.\n    *   Shape 3 Hole Pixels (Expected 6): `(2, 15)...(2, 18)`, `(3, 15)...(3, 18)`, `(4, 15)...(4, 18)`, `(5, 15)...(5, 18)`. Code Output: Some are `2` (border overwrite), some are `8` (misclassified as shape), some are `6` (correct). Specifically, `(3,16),(3,17),(4,16),(4,17)` were correct, others wrong.\n\n**Example 3 Failure Analysis:**\n\n*   **Input Shape 1 (Top Left):** No holes. Expected fill: blue (1).\n*   **Input Shape 2 (Top Right):** No holes. Expected fill: blue (1).\n*   **Input Shape 3 (Bottom):** Has holes. Expected fill: azure (8), magenta (6).\n*   **Incorrect Pixels:** Errors are in the hole area of Shape 3.\n    *   Shape 3 Hole Pixels (Expected 6): `(13, 5), (13, 6)`. Code Output: `(13,5)=2, (13,6)=2`. Border overwrite issue.\n\n**Conclusion from Metrics:** The primary issue is the handling of yellow pixels that are *both* adjacent to a blue shape *and* part of an enclosed hole. The expected behavior is that they become magenta (6), but the current code often makes them red (2) as part of the border. The secondary issue might be accurately identifying the full extent of the hole region associated with a shape.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
