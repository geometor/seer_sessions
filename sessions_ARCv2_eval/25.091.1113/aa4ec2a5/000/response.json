The output grids maintain the overall dimensions and the yellow background but modify the blue shapes.\n2.  **Object Identification:** The core objects in the input are contiguous regions of blue (1) pixels, set against a uniform yellow (4) background.\n3.  **Transformation - Bordering:** In the output, every blue shape from the input is surrounded by a one-pixel thick border of red (2) pixels. This border replaces adjacent yellow pixels or expands the shape's footprint slightly where it touches the grid edge.\n4.  **Transformation - Interior Filling:** The pixels that were originally blue (1) in the input undergo a conditional change based on the topology of the shape:\n    *   **Shapes with Holes:** If a blue shape in the input completely encloses one or more regions of the yellow (4) background (i.e., it has \"holes\"), its interior is filled differently. The pixels that were originally blue (1) become azure (8). The pixels that formed the enclosed yellow (4) \"holes\" become magenta (6).\n    *   **Shapes without Holes:** If a blue shape in the input does not enclose any background pixels (it is \"solid\"), the pixels that were originally blue (1) remain blue (1) in the output.\n5.  **Background:** Pixels that were yellow (4) in the input and are not part of the new red (2) border remain yellow (4) in the output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
