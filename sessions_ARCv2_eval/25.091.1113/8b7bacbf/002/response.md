## General Assessment

The initial code successfully implements the hypothesized rule: "Fill white regions that are fully enclosed by a single non-white color and do not touch the grid edge, using the unique yellow(4) or orange(7) pixel's color found elsewhere in the grid."

However, the results show this rule is necessary but not sufficient. In examples 1, 2, and 3, the code correctly identifies multiple enclosed white regions matching these criteria, but the expected output only fills a *subset* of them. Example 4, where the rule works perfectly, only has one such region.

The primary challenge is identifying the **additional filtering condition** that determines *which* of the geometrically enclosed regions should actually be filled. The current logic overfills because it lacks this filter.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Analyze Differences:** Systematically compare the properties of the correctly filled regions versus the incorrectly filled regions (which still meet the basic enclosure criteria) in examples 1, 2, and 3.
2.  **Identify Distinguishing Feature:** Look for patterns related to:
    *   The color of the boundary shape.
    *   The relationship between the boundary color and the fill color (Yellow/4 or Orange/7).
    *   Geometric properties of the white region or the boundary shape (size, shape, complexity, bounding box).
    *   Positional relationships (e.g., proximity to the fill color pixel, proximity to other grid elements).
    *   Topological properties (e.g., holes within the boundary shape itself).
3.  **Refine Rule:** Update the natural language program and YAML facts to include the discovered filtering condition.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's analyze the relationship between the fill color and the boundary color for regions that *should* be filled versus those that *shouldn't* (but were incorrectly filled by the initial code).
