The code implemented this using connected components (BFS) and checking boundary conditions (uniform color, no edge contact, color filter).\n\nHowever, the tests revealed failures indicating the initial rule was incomplete:\n1.  **Overfilling (Examples 1, 2, 3):** The code filled some regions that should have remained white. Analysis shows these incorrectly filled regions were consistently 2x2 white squares enclosed *specifically* by red (2) pixels.\n2.  **Underfilling (Example 3):** The code failed to fill one region `{(1,18),(1,19),(2,18),(2,19)}` that *was* filled in the expected output. This region is unique because its boundary is *not* uniform (contains red and green pixels), contradicting the uniform boundary rule derived from other examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine the Rule:** Incorporate the observation about excluding 2x2 white regions enclosed by red pixels. This appears to fix the overfilling errors in all examples where it occurred.\n2.  **Address Example 3 Anomaly:** The non-uniform boundary region filled in Example 3 remains unexplained by the refined rule. Given it contradicts the pattern in other examples, we will proceed with the refined rule that works for Ex 1, 2, 4 and the *other* regions in Ex 3. We'll note the discrepancy for potential"
