## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial hypothesis correctly identified the core mechanism: filling enclosed white regions with a specific color found elsewhere. However, the results show that the definition of "enclosed" or the condition for filling was too broad. The previous code filled *any* white region enclosed by a single non-white color (and not touching the edge), but the examples demonstrate a more specific rule is required.

**Analysis of Discrepancies:**

1.  **Example 1 (Orange Fill):** The code incorrectly filled regions enclosed by Green (3). The expected output only fills regions enclosed by Red (2) and Gray (5).
2.  **Example 2 (Yellow Fill):** The code incorrectly filled a region enclosed by Red (2) at `(4,12)-(5,13)`. Closer inspection of the *expected* output shows this region *is not* filled. Re-checking the boundary condition: the neighbors of this white region include `(3,13)` which is white (0). The previous code *shouldn't* have filled this according to its own logic (`is_uniform_non_white` check). There might be a bug in the implementation or my previous analysis of the code's incorrect output was wrong. Assuming the code worked as intended by the refined logic below, it would *not* fill this region, aligning with the expected output. *Correction*: The code output provided shows it *did* fill regions bounded by Red(2) at `(4,12)-(5,13)` and `(5,12)-(5,13)`. Let's re-re-examine `(4,12),(4,13),(5,12),(5,13)`. Neighbors: (3,12)=2, (3,13)=0, (4,11)=2, (4,14)=2, (5,11)=2, (5,14)=2, (6,12)=2, (6,13)=2. Because of the white(0) neighbor at (3,13), this is *not* enclosed by a *single non-white* color. The previous code should not have filled it. The provided "Transformed Output" for Example 2 seems inconsistent with the previous code's logic. Let's proceed assuming the *refined* logic is the target.
3.  **Example 3 (Yellow Fill):** The code incorrectly filled regions enclosed by Green (3). The expected output only fills regions enclosed by Red (2).
4.  **Example 4 (Yellow Fill):** The code worked correctly. The fill color was Yellow (4), and the only enclosed region was bounded by Red (2), which was correctly filled.

**Refined Strategy:**

The key is a filter based on the `fill_color` and the `boundary_color` of the enclosed white region.

*   Identify the unique `fill_color` (Orange/7 or Yellow/4).
*   Identify all white regions enclosed by a single, uniform, non-white `boundary_color` that do not touch the edge.
*   Apply a filter:
    *   If `fill_color` is Orange (7), only fill the region if `boundary_color` is Red (2) or Gray (5).
    *   If `fill_color` is Yellow (4), only fill the region if `boundary_color` is Red (2).

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's analyze each example with the refined strategy in mind. We need to find the fill color, identify enclosed white regions, their boundary colors, and whether they should be filled according to the refined rule.
