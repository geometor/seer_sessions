Example 2 uses White (0) as the background and Green (3) as the foreground/object color. The background color appears to be the most frequent color in the grid.\n3.  **Objects:** The foreground colors form sparse pixels and some horizontal and vertical lines or segments.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve \"filling\" small horizontal gaps. Specifically, when a sequence of `Color Background Background Background Color` appears horizontally in a row (where `Color` is the same non-background color and `Background` is the background color), the three `Background` pixels are changed to `Color`.\n5.  **Consistency:** This gap-filling rule applies consistently in both examples, despite the different background and foreground colors. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
