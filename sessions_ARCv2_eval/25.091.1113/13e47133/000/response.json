            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are the same size (20x20 in the examples).\n2.  **Separators:** The input grids contain prominent red (2) lines acting as separators, both vertical and horizontal. These red separators appear unchanged in the exact same positions in the output grid.\n3.  **Regions:** The red separators divide the grid into distinct rectangular regions. In `train_1`, there's one vertical separator (col 8) and two horizontal ones (row 9, row 15), creating 6 regions. In `train_2`, there's one vertical (col 10) and one horizontal (row 12), creating 4 regions.\n4.  **Background Color:** Each input grid seems to have a dominant background color (blue 1 in `train_1`, yellow 4 in `train_2`). This background color is largely replaced in the output regions.\n5.  **Key Pixels:** Within each region of the input grid, certain non-background, non-red pixels appear to be significant. These seem to determine the colors used within that region in the output.\n6.  **Transformation within Regions:** Each region in the output grid appears to be filled based on the key pixels found in the corresponding input region.\n    *   **Fill Color:** The primary color filling the bulk of an output region seems determined by the \"first\" key pixel in the input region (sorted by row, then column). If a region has no key pixels, a default fill color is used, potentially determined by the region's position (left vs. right side of the vertical separator).\n    *   **Pattern Overlay:** A distinct geometric pattern (like a frame or stencil) is overlaid onto each region in the output.\n    *   **Pattern Color(s):** The color(s) used for this pattern seem determined by the *other* key pixels (beyond the first one) in the input region. If there's only one key pixel (or none), a default pattern color is used, again potentially based on position (left vs. right). If there are multiple key pixels beyond the first one, the pattern's pixels seem to take the color of the nearest corresponding input key pixel (using Manhattan distance, with tie-breaking based on the original pixel's position).\n7.  **Geometric Patterns:** The geometric shape of the pattern overlay appears consistent for all regions on the left side of the vertical separator and potentially different but consistent for all regions on the right side.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

These form the separators.\n3.  **Define Regions:** Use the separators to divide the input grid into distinct rectangular regions.\n4.  **Define Patterns:** Determine the geometric shapes (stencils) for the Left Pattern (applied to regions left of the main vertical separator) and the Right Pattern (applied to regions right of the main vertical separator) by observing the non-fill colors in the example outputs.\n5.  **Initialize Output:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initially copying only the red (2) separator pixels.\n6.  **Process Each Region:** For each region defined in step 3:\n    a.  **Find Key Pixels:** Collect all pixels within the current input region whose color is neither the background color nor red (2).\n    b.  **Sort Key Pixels:** Sort these key pixels first by row index, then by column index. Let the sorted list be `P = [P1, P2, P3, ...]`.\n    c.  **Determine Fill Color (C_fill):**\n        *   If `P` is empty, determine the default fill color based on whether the region is to the left or right of the main vertical separator (derive defaults from examples).\n        *   If `P` is not empty, set `C_fill = color(P1)`.\n    d.  **Determine Pattern Source Pixels (PatternP):** Create a list `PatternP` containing all pixels from `P` *except* `P1`. (i.e., `PatternP = [P2, P3, ...]`).\n    e.  **Determine Default Pattern Color (C_pattern_default):**\n        *   If `P` contains 0 or 1 pixel, determine the default pattern color based on whether the region is to the left or right (derive defaults from examples).\n    f.  **Apply Transformation to Output Region:** Iterate through each pixel location `(r, c)` within the current region's boundaries in the output grid:\n        *   Check if `(r, c)` corresponds to a location in the region's designated pattern stencil (LeftPattern or RightPattern).\n        *   **If `(r, c)` is part of the pattern stencil:**\n            *   If `PatternP` is empty, set the output pixel `(r, c)` to `C_pattern_default`.\n            *   If `PatternP` is not empty, find the pixel `Pj` in `PatternP` that has the minimum Manhattan distance to `(r, c)`. If there's a tie in distance, choose the `Pj` that appeared earliest in the original sorted list `P`. Set the output pixel `(r, c)` to `color(Pj)`.\n        *   **If `(r, c)` is NOT part of the pattern stencil:**\n            *   Set the output pixel `(r, c)` to `C_fill`.\n7.  **Return Output:** The completed output grid contains the original separators and the filled/patterned regions."
