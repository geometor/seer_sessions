            "text": "**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are orange (7), magenta (6), and red (2). Orange appears to be the background color. Magenta is present in the input as vertical lines and is the color used for filling in the output. Red forms various shapes scattered across the grid.\n2.  **Input Structure:** The input grid contains one or more red objects and one or two distinct vertical lines composed entirely of magenta pixels. These magenta lines always span the full height of the grid. The rest of the grid is typically filled with the orange background color.\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is the input grid modified by changing some orange pixels to magenta. The original red objects and magenta lines remain unchanged.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying a specific region based on the vertical magenta lines and the locations of the red objects, and then filling the orange pixels within that region with magenta.\n5.  **Region Identification:**\n    *   **Vertical Boundaries:** The vertical magenta lines in the input define the vertical boundaries of the region to be filled.\n        *   If two magenta lines exist, the region is between these two lines (inclusive of the columns containing the lines).\n        *   If only one magenta line exists, the region is between that line (inclusive) and the closest vertical edge of the grid (left or right edge). The side chosen (left or right of the single line) is the one containing red objects. More precisely, it seems to be the area from the grid edge *up to* the single magenta line, encompassing any red objects found in that span.\n        *   If no magenta lines exist (though not shown in examples, consider this edge case), maybe no filling occurs, or it fills based only on red objects. The examples all have lines, so we focus on that.\n    *   **Horizontal Boundaries:** Within the vertically defined columns, the horizontal boundaries (top and bottom rows) of the fill region are determined by the minimum and maximum row indices containing any red pixels within those specific columns.\n6.  **Filling Process:** All pixels that are originally orange (7) within the identified rectangular region (defined by the vertical boundaries from magenta lines/edges and horizontal boundaries from red objects) are changed to magenta (6). Pixels that are already red (2) or part of the original magenta (6) lines within this region remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all columns that consist entirely of magenta (6) pixels (these are the vertical magenta lines). Store their column indices.\n3.  Determine the vertical range (minimum and maximum column indices) for the potential fill area based on the identified magenta lines:\n    *   If two magenta lines are found at columns `c1` and `c2` (where `c1 < c2`), the vertical range is from `c1` to `c2`, inclusive.\n    *   If one magenta line is found at column `c`, determine which side (left or right) relative to this line contains red (2) pixels.\n        *   Check for red pixels in columns `0` to `c`. If found, the vertical range is `0` to `c`, inclusive.\n        *   Check for red pixels in columns `c` to `grid_width - 1`. If found, the vertical range is `c` to `grid_width - 1`, inclusive. (Assume red pixels won't exist on both sides relative to a single line based on examples). If red pixels exist both left and right (or if only one side is checked and is positive), assume the range is from the line to the nearest edge encompassing red pixels. *Refinement based on examples:* If one line at `c` exists, the range seems to be columns `0` to `c` *if* red pixels exist in that range, OR columns `c` to `grid_width-1` *if* red pixels exist in *that* range. The examples suggest it fills the side containing the red pixels, bounded by the line and the grid edge.\n    *   If no magenta lines are found, no filling occurs (the output is identical to the input).\n4.  If a vertical range (`min_col`, `max_col`) was determined:\n    *   Find all red (2) pixels within this vertical range (columns `min_col` to `max_col`).\n    *   If no red pixels are found within this range, no filling occurs.\n    *   If red pixels are found, determine the minimum (`min_row`) and maximum (`max_row`) row indices among these red pixels.\n    *   Iterate through all cells in the output grid within the rectangle defined by `min_row`, `max_row`, `min_col`, `max_col`.\n    *   If a cell's color in the original input grid at this location `(row, col)` is orange (7), change its color in the output grid to magenta (6).\n5.
