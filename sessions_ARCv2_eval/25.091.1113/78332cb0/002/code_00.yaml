facts:
  - element: grid
    attributes:
      - type: input/output
      - pixels: colored integers (0-9)
      - dimensions: height, width
  - element: delimiter
    attributes:
      - color: magenta (6)
      - shape: single-pixel-thick lines (horizontal rows or vertical columns)
      - function: separates subgrids
      - property: orientation (Horizontal, Vertical, Both) - determined by which type of delimiter line exists.
  - element: subgrid
    attributes:
      - content: rectangular blocks of non-magenta pixels
      - source: extracted from input grid based on delimiters
      - properties: internal pattern/shape, background color, dimensions
      - relationship: arranged in a layout dictated by delimiter orientation (e.g., vertical stack if Horizontal delimiters, horizontal row if Vertical delimiters, 2D grid if Both)
  - element: process
    attributes:
      - step 1: identify delimiter lines (full rows/columns of magenta)
      - step 2: determine dominant delimiter orientation (Horizontal, Vertical, or Both)
      - step 3: extract subgrids based on delimiters
      - step 4: create an ordered list of subgrids (top-to-bottom, left-to-right reading order)
      - step 5: apply transformation rule based on delimiter orientation:
        - if Horizontal Only: reverse subgrid order, arrange horizontally, use vertical delimiters
        - if Vertical Only: preserve subgrid order, stack vertically, use horizontal delimiters
        - if Both: apply specific reorder (TL, BR, TR, BL for 2x2), stack vertically, use horizontal delimiters
      - step 6: construct output grid by assembling subgrids and inserting appropriate delimiters
