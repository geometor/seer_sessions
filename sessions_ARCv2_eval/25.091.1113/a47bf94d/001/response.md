Transformation Rule:
1. Find all solid 3x3 squares of a single color (not white/0) in the input grid.
2. For each found solid 3x3 square:
    a. Hollow it out in place by changing its center pixel to white (0).
    b. Determine a 'partner' color based on a swap rule: Red (2) <-> Green (3), Blue (1) <-> Yellow (4), Magenta (6) <-> Magenta (6).
    c. Determine a new location for a corresponding hollow frame based on the original square's position:
        i. If all original solid 3x3 squares were found in row 1, the new location's top-left corner is (14, original_col).
        ii. Otherwise, if the original square was in column 2, the new location's top-left corner is (original_row, 15).
        iii. Otherwise, if the original square was in column 15, the new location's top-left corner is (original_row, 2).
        iv. (Assumption: The examples cover all location rules needed).
    d. Create a new 3x3 hollow frame (center pixel white/0, perimeter pixels are the partner color) at the calculated new location.
3. Keep all other elements (background, complex shapes, pre-existing hollow frames) unchanged.
