**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core concepts: finding solid 3x3 squares, hollowing them, swapping colors, and creating new hollow frames at shifted positions. However, the code implementation failed because it didn't correctly execute the "hollowing" step for the *original* squares.

*   **Error:** The code only changed the center pixel of the original 3x3 square to white (0), leaving the perimeter pixels unchanged.
*   **Expected Behavior:** The entire original 3x3 square should be transformed into a hollow frame (perimeter pixels remain the original color, center pixel becomes white).
*   **Strategy:** Modify the code to explicitly redraw the original solid 3x3 square as a hollow 3x3 frame *in place*, using its original color for the perimeter. The logic for finding squares, determining new locations, swapping colors, and drawing the *new* frame appears correct based on the examples and needs no change. Pre-existing hollow frames in the input are correctly ignored by the `find_solid_3x3_squares` function and should remain unchanged unless overwritten by a newly created frame.
