            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code failed on all training examples, indicating a fundamental misunderstanding of the transformation rule. The key errors were:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Modification:** The code modified the *original* solid 3x3 squares by hollowing them out. The expected outputs show the original squares are *not* modified unless overwritten by a *new* frame.\n2.  **Incorrect New Object Type:** The code created *solid* 3x3 squares at the new locations instead of the required *hollow* 3x3 frames.\n3.  **Flawed Location Logic (Example 1 & 3):** While the column-swapping logic (2 <-> 15) was partially identified, it wasn't correctly implemented or prioritized over the row-based rule (row 1 -> row 14). The `all_in_row_1` check seems to take precedence.\n4.  **Handling Existing Frames:** The code didn't explicitly ensure that pre-existing hollow frames were ignored during the transformation process (although `find_solid_3x3_squares` implicitly helped, the drawing step could overwrite them).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Modify the core logic: Instead of modifying the input grid directly or hollowing squares in place, create a clean copy of the input grid.\n2.  Identify only the *solid* 3x3 squares in the *original input*.\n3.  For each identified solid square, determine its swapped color and target location based on the refined rules (checking `all_in_row_1` first, then `c==2`, then `c==15`).\n4.  Draw a *new*, *hollow* 3x3 frame with the swapped color at the target location on the output grid copy. This new frame might overwrite parts of the original grid, which is expected.\n5.  Ensure the function to draw frames correctly creates a hollow structure (perimeter of color, center white).\n6.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect this process.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
