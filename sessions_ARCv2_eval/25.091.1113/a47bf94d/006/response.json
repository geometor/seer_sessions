            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core elements: finding solid 3x3 squares, swapping colors, and calculating new positions. However, the comparison between the transformed output and the expected output revealed a fundamental misunderstanding of the transformation applied to both the original squares and the newly created objects.\n\n*   **Error 1:** The original solid 3x3 squares were left untouched in the previous code's output, whereas the expected output shows them transformed into hollow frames *in place*.\n*   **Error 2:** The object created at the new location was assumed to be a hollow frame, but careful re-examination of the expected outputs shows it's a different 3x3 pattern (a \"cross\" shape).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct In-Place Transformation:** Modify the logic to explicitly replace the original solid 3x3 square with a hollow 3x3 frame (center pixel white=0, perimeter pixels=original color).\n2.  **Correct New Object Creation:** Identify the correct 3x3 pattern for the object created at the new location. Based on visual inspection, it appears to be a \"cross\" pattern: the center and corner pixels have the swapped color, while the remaining pixels are white (0). Specifically: `[[C,0,C],[0,C,0],[C,0,C]]` where C is the swapped color. Update the drawing logic for the new object accordingly.\n3.  **Refine Rules:** Ensure the location rules (Row 1 -> Row 14 vs. Column 2 <-> Column 15) and color swap rules are correctly applied based on the analysis of all examples.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\n*(Metrics gathering code was run during the thought process, revealing discrepancies that led to the following corrected observations)*\n\n*   **Object 1: Solid 3x3 Square (Input)**\n    *   Found in inputs with colors Red(2), Green(3), Blue(1), Yellow(4), Magenta(6).\n    *   Other colored shapes (Azure, Gray, Maroon) and pre-existing hollow frames are ignored by the core transformation logic.\n*   **Transformation 1: In-Place Hollowing**\n    *   Affects the original location of the solid 3x3 square.\n    *   Replaces the solid square with a **hollow frame**: center pixel becomes White(0), the 8 perimeter pixels retain the *original* color.\n    *   Example 1: Green(3) square at (2,2) becomes hollow Green frame at (2,2). Red(2) square at (10,2) becomes hollow Red frame at (10,2).\n*   **Transformation 2: New Object Creation**\n    *   Occurs at a new location determined by the position rules.\n    *   Uses the *swapped* color (Red<->Green, Blue<->Yellow, Magenta<->Magenta).\n    *   Creates a **cross pattern**, *not* a hollow frame: `[[C,0,C],[0,C,0],[C,0,C]]` where C is the swapped color.\n    *   Example 1: New Red(2) cross at (2,15). New Green(3) cross at (10,15).\n*   **Location Rules:**\n    *   **Rule A:** If *all* identified solid squares in the input are in Row 1 (r=1), the new object's top-left corner is (14, original_col). (See Examples 2 & 3).\n    *   **Rule B:** If identified solid squares are in *different* rows OR if any are *not* in Row 1, the rule appears to be a column swap: if original_col=2, new_col=15; if original_col=15, new_col=2. The row remains the same (new_row=original_row). (See Example 1 - squares are in rows 2 and 10, so col 2 swaps to col 15).\n*   **Overwriting:** Newly created objects (frames or crosses) can overwrite existing pixels, including pre-existing patterns in the input grid (as seen in Example 3 where a new Blue cross overwrites an input Blue hollow frame).\n\n**YAML Facts Block**\n\n"

Scan the *input* grid to find the top-left coordinates (r, c) and color C of all **solid 3x3 squares** whose color is Blue(1), Red(2), Green(3), Yellow(4), or Magenta(6). Store these findings.\n3.  If no such squares are found, return the initial output grid copy unchanged.\n4.  Determine the **location rule**: Check if *all* found squares have r=1.\n    *   If YES, the rule is \"Row Move\".\n    *   If NO (squares are in different rows, or none are in row 1), the rule is \"Column Swap\".\n5.  Iterate through each found solid square (r, c, C):\n    a.  **Hollow In Place:** Modify the *output grid* at the original location (r, c). Change the center pixel `(r+1, c+1)` to White(0) and ensure the 8 surrounding perimeter pixels within the 3x3 area `(r..r+2, c..c+2)` are set to the original color C.\n    b.  **Swap Color:** Determine the partner color `C_partner` based on the rules: Red(2)<->Green(3), Blue(1)<->Yellow(4), Magenta(6)<->Magenta(6).\n    c.  **Calculate New Location:** Based on the location rule determined in step 4:\n        *   If rule is \"Row Move\": `new_r = 14`, `new_c = c`.\n        *   If rule is \"Column Swap\":\n            *   If `c == 2`: `new_r = r`, `new_c = 15`.\n            *   If `c == 15`: `new_r = r`, `new_c = 2`.\n            *   (Assume no other column swap cases).\n    d.  **Create New Cross Pattern:** Modify the *output grid* at the new location `(new_r, new_c)`. Create a 3x3 \"cross\" pattern using `C_partner`: Set pixels `(new_r, new_c)`, `(new_r, new_c+2)`, `(new_r+1, new_c+1)`, `(new_r+2, new_c)`, `(new_r+2, new_c+2)` to `C_partner`. Set the other 4 pixels within the 3x3 area `(new_r..new_r+2, new_c..new_c+2)` to White(0). This may overwrite existing grid content.\n6.  Return the modified output grid."
