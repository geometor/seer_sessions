            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** Contains a background of white pixels (0) and various colored shapes.\n2.  **Key Objects:** The most prominent and consistently transformed objects are solid 3x3 squares of specific colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Magenta). Other complex shapes made of Azure, Gray, and Maroon also exist but seem unchanged by the transformation. Some inputs also contain hollow 3x3 frames (e.g., Train 3 input has a Blue frame).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves two steps applied to the solid 3x3 squares:\n    *   **Hollowing:** Each solid 3x3 square found in the input is modified in place by changing its center pixel to white (0), effectively turning it into a hollow frame.\n    *   **Copying/Swapping:** A *new* hollow frame is created elsewhere in the grid. The color of this new frame is determined by a color-swapping rule applied to the original square's color. The location of this new frame depends on the position(s) of the original solid 3x3 square(s).\n4.  **Color Swapping:** There's a consistent pairing for color swaps: Red (2) swaps with Green (3), Blue (1) swaps with Yellow (4). Magenta (6) seems to swap with itself.\n5.  **Location Rule for New Frames:** The placement of the *new* hollow frame depends on the arrangement of the original solid 3x3 squares:\n    *   If all original solid 3x3 squares are found in the same row (specifically row index 1 in the examples), the new frame is placed at row index 14, keeping the original column index.\n    *   If the original solid 3x3 squares are located at specific columns (column index 2 and column index 15 in the example), the new frame keeps the original row index, but the column index is swapped (2 becomes 15, 15 becomes 2).\n6.  **Invariant Elements:** The background white pixels and the complex Azure/Gray/Maroon structures remain unchanged. Pre-existing hollow frames in the input also remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts Block**\n\n"
