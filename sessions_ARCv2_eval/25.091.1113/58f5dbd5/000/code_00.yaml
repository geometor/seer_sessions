task_description: Filter objects in a grid, keeping only solid rectangles, and crop the output grid around the kept objects with a border.

definitions:
  - object: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-background color.
  - background_color: The color that forms the border and fills the space between objects. It is typically the most frequent color or the color at the grid corners.
  - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of an object.
  - solid_rectangle: An object where every pixel within its bounding box has the object's color (no background pixels within the bounding box).

input_elements:
  - grid: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors.
  - background: The background color pixel value.
  - objects: Multiple distinct objects of various colors and shapes embedded in the background.

output_elements:
  - grid: A potentially smaller 2D array of pixels.
  - background: The same background color as the input.
  - objects: A subset of the input objects, specifically only the solid rectangles.

transformation_steps:
  - 1. Identify the background color.
  - 2. Find all distinct objects (contiguous non-background pixels).
  - 3. For each object:
      - a. Determine its color.
      - b. Calculate its bounding box.
      - c. Check if it's a solid rectangle (all pixels within the bounding box match the object's color).
  - 4. Filter the objects, selecting only the solid rectangles.
  - 5. Determine the minimal bounding box enclosing all selected solid rectangles.
  - 6. Extract the subgrid from the input corresponding to this minimal bounding box.
  - 7. Create the output grid, sized to fit the extracted subgrid plus a 1-pixel border on all sides.
  - 8. Fill the output grid border with the background color.
  - 9. Place the extracted subgrid into the center of the output grid.

relationships:
  - Objects are distinct from the background.
  - Objects are classified based on whether they form a solid rectangle within their bounding box.
  - The output grid's content is a cropped section of the input grid.
  - The output grid's size depends on the spatial extent of the selected solid rectangles.
  - The relative positions of the selected objects are preserved from input to output.
