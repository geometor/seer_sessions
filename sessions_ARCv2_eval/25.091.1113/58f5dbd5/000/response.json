(e.g., the blue '1', magenta '6', and bottom-right yellow '4' in Ex1; blue '1', red '2', green '3' in Ex2; azure '8', top-left yellow '4', left green '3', bottom-left maroon '9' in Ex3).\n    *   **Non-Solid Objects:** Objects whose bounding box contains pixels of the background color (i.e., they have \"holes\" or are not perfectly rectangular fills). (e.g., the top-left yellow '4', green '3', maroon '9', gray '5' in Ex1; magenta '6', azure '8', maroon '9' in Ex2; red '2', orange '7', middle maroon '9', gray '5', bottom azure '8', bottom magenta '6', bottom-right yellow '4', bottom-right green '3' in Ex3).\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation filters the objects, keeping *only* the \"Solid Rectangles\".\n5.  **Output Grid:** The output grid contains the selected solid rectangles, preserving their relative positions. The grid is cropped to the minimum bounding box required to contain all selected objects, plus a one-pixel border of the original background color.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"

It is typically the most frequent color or the color at the grid corners.\n  - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of an object.\n  - solid_rectangle: An object where every pixel within its bounding box has the object's color (no background pixels within the bounding box).\n\ninput_elements:\n  - grid: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors.\n  - background: The background color pixel value.\n  - objects: Multiple distinct objects of various colors and shapes embedded in the background.\n\noutput_elements:\n  - grid: A potentially smaller 2D array of pixels.\n  - background: The same background color as the input.\n  - objects: A subset of the input objects, specifically only the solid rectangles.\n\ntransformation_steps:\n  - 1.

Determine its color and find its bounding box (the smallest rectangle enclosing it).\n    b.  Check if the object completely fills its bounding box with its own color.

Find the overall minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, and maximum column occupied by any pixel belonging to *any* of the solid rectangles identified in step 4.
