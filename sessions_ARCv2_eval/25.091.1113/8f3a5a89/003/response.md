Transformation Rule:

1. Identify the single magenta pixel (color 6) as the starting point.
2. Perform a flood fill originating from the magenta pixel to identify all reachable pixels.
   - The fill can move horizontally and vertically.
   - The fill can move through gray pixels (color 8) and the starting magenta pixel (color 6).
   - The fill is stopped by blue pixels (color 1), which act as boundaries.
   - Keep track of all coordinates visited during this fill (the 'reachable area').
3. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
4. Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
5. If a pixel is gray (color 8) and its coordinates are within the 'reachable area' identified in step 2:
   - Check if this gray pixel is a 'border' pixel within the reachable area. A pixel is considered a 'border' pixel if at least one of its direct neighbors (up, down, left, right) meets any of the following conditions:
     a) The neighbor is outside the grid boundaries.
     b) The neighbor is a blue pixel (color 1).
     c) The neighbor is a gray pixel (color 8) BUT its coordinates are NOT in the 'reachable area'.
     d) The neighbor is the original magenta start pixel (color 6). Note: This condition implicitly includes the case where the magenta pixel itself might be considered a "neighbor" for adjacency checks relative to the gray pixels being evaluated. More simply, any reachable gray pixel adjacent to the start pixel is a border pixel.
6. If the gray pixel meets the 'border' condition (from step 5), change its color to orange (color 7) in the output grid.
7. All other pixels (blue, magenta, and non-border reachable gray pixels, and unreachable gray pixels) retain their original colors in the output grid.
8. Return the modified output grid.
