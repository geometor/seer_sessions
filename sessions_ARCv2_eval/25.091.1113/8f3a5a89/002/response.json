            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous attempt using a simple flood fill was incorrect. The transformed outputs colored all reachable gray pixels, whereas the expected outputs only colored a subset of them. The key insight missed was that only the gray pixels \"bordering\" the reachable area or the start pixel should be colored orange. The \"border\" is defined by adjacency (horizontal/vertical) to the grid edge, a blue boundary pixel, a gray pixel outside the reachable area, or the initial magenta start pixel.\n\nThe strategy is to first identify all reachable pixels (gray and magenta) starting from the magenta pixel, bounded by blue pixels, using a flood fill. Then, iterate through the identified reachable gray pixels and change their color to orange *only if* they meet the border condition described above.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nCode was executed to determine the set of coordinates reachable from the magenta (6) pixel without crossing blue (1) boundaries for each training example.\n\n"
