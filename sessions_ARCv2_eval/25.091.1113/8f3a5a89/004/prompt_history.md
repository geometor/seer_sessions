## Perception

The task involves identifying a specific starting pixel (magenta, color 6) and using it as the origin for a flood fill operation. The fill operation targets the background pixels (gray, color 8). The boundaries for the fill are defined by pixels of another specific color (blue, color 1). The fill color itself is orange (color 7). The boundary pixels (blue) and the starting pixel (magenta) remain unchanged in the output grid. All gray pixels reachable from the magenta starting pixel without crossing a blue pixel are changed to orange.

## Facts

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify the coordinates (row, column) of the single magenta pixel (color 6) in the input grid. This is the starting point.
3.  Perform a flood fill operation starting from the identified magenta pixel's coordinates:
    *   Maintain a list or set of coordinates to visit, initially containing only the starting point coordinates.
    *   Maintain a set of visited coordinates to avoid cycles and redundant checks.
    *   While the list of coordinates to visit is not empty:
        *   Dequeue a coordinate (current\_row, current\_col).
        *   If this coordinate has already been visited, continue to the next iteration.
        *   Mark the coordinate as visited.
        *   Check the color of the pixel at (current\_row, current\_col) in the input grid:
            *   If the color is gray (8), change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to orange (7).
            *   If the color is gray (8) or magenta (6), examine its four neighbors (up, down, left, right):
                *   For each neighbor within the grid boundaries:
                    *   If the neighbor has not been visited and its color in the input grid is not blue (1), add the neighbor's coordinates to the list of coordinates to visit.
4.  Return the modified output grid.

Transformation Rule:

1. Identify the single magenta pixel (color 6) as the starting point.
2. Perform a flood fill originating from the magenta pixel to identify all reachable pixels.
   - The fill can move horizontally and vertically.
   - The fill can move through gray pixels (color 8) and the starting magenta pixel (color 6).
   - The fill is stopped by blue pixels (color 1), which act as boundaries.
   - Keep track of all coordinates visited during this fill (the 'reachable area').
3. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
4. Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
5. If a pixel is gray (color 8) and its coordinates are within the 'reachable area' identified in step 2:
   - Check if this gray pixel is a 'border' pixel within the reachable area. A pixel is considered a 'border' pixel if at least one of its direct neighbors (up, down, left, right) meets any of the following conditions:
     a) The neighbor is outside the grid boundaries.
     b) The neighbor is a blue pixel (color 1).
     c) The neighbor is a gray pixel (color 8) BUT its coordinates are NOT in the 'reachable area'.
     d) The neighbor is the original magenta start pixel (color 6). Note: This condition implicitly includes the case where the magenta pixel itself might be considered a "neighbor" for adjacency checks relative to the gray pixels being evaluated. More simply, any reachable gray pixel adjacent to the start pixel is a border pixel.
6. If the gray pixel meets the 'border' condition (from step 5), change its color to orange (color 7) in the output grid.
7. All other pixels (blue, magenta, and non-border reachable gray pixels, and unreachable gray pixels) retain their original colors in the output grid.
8. Return the modified output grid.
