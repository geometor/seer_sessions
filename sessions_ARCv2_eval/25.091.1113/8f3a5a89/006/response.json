            "text": "## Assessment\n\nThe previous attempt implemented a standard flood fill algorithm, changing *all* reachable gray pixels (8) to orange (7). However, the results show that this is incorrect. Comparing the transformed output with the expected output across all examples reveals a consistent pattern: only the gray pixels (8) that are *adjacent* to a boundary (grid edge, blue pixel '1', or the starting magenta pixel '6') within the reachable area are changed to orange (7). Gray pixels within the reachable area but not adjacent to any boundary retain their original gray color (8).\n\nThe core task involves two steps:\n1.  Identifying the region reachable from the magenta (6) start point, without crossing blue (1) boundaries.\n2.  Coloring only the gray (8) pixels within this reachable region that lie on its \"border\".\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's analyze the pixel counts to confirm the hypothesis. We'll count the number of gray (8) and orange (7) pixels in the input, expected output, and the transformed output from the previous incorrect attempt.\n\n"
