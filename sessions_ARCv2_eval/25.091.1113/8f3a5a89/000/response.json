The fill operation targets the background pixels (gray, color 8). The boundaries for the fill are defined by pixels of another specific color (blue, color 1). The fill color itself is orange (color 7). The boundary pixels (blue) and the starting pixel (magenta) remain unchanged in the output grid. All gray pixels reachable from the magenta starting pixel without crossing a blue pixel are changed to orange.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
