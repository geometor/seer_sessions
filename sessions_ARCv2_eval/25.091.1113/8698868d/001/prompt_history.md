Okay, I will analyze the provided training examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple distinct, roughly rectangular regions of solid colors. These regions are often imperfect, containing pixels of a different color ("noise") within their boundaries. In `train_1`, the noise color is azure (8), and it appears both within and between the main colored regions (blue-1, yellow-4, red-2, green-3). In `train_2`, the noise color seems to be primarily red (2), and it often surrounds smaller colored regions or appears within larger ones. There are also other noise colors present (e.g., maroon-9 within red-2).
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are smaller than the inputs and appear "cleaner". They consist of well-defined rectangular blocks. Each block is composed of an outer "frame" of one color and an inner, smaller "picture" of another color. The picture is centered within the frame, leaving a border one pixel thick.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve identifying pairs of shapes in the input: a larger "frame" shape and a smaller "picture" shape. The picture shape is spatially located within the frame shape in the input grid, potentially separated or obscured by noise pixels. The noise pixels are disregarded. The output is constructed by creating perfect rectangular versions of these frame/picture pairs (frame color `C1`, picture color `C2`) and arranging them according to the relative positions of the frames in the input.
4.  **Shape Sizes:** There's a consistent relationship between the frame and picture sizes. If the frame is HxW, the picture is (H-2)x(W-2).
    *   In `train_1`: Frames are 6x6 (blue, yellow), Pictures are 4x4 (red, green).
    *   In `train_2`: Frames are 8x8 (yellow, green, azure, blue), Pictures are 6x6 (maroon, orange, blue, gray).
5.  **Pairing Logic:** The pairing of a frame color `C1` with a picture color `C2` seems determined by spatial containment in the input. The bounding box of the picture shape lies within the bounding box of the frame shape.
6.  **Arrangement:** The final output grid arranges the combined frame+picture units based on the relative spatial arrangement of the corresponding frame shapes in the input grid.

**YAML Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze Input Shapes:** Scan the input grid to identify the two primary sizes of roughly rectangular, single-color regions (ignoring noise pixels within or around them). Let the larger size be HxW (the "frame" size) and the smaller size be (H-2)x(W-2) (the "picture" size).
2.  **Identify Frames:** Locate all distinct HxW rectangular areas in the input grid that are predominantly composed of a single color, `C1`. Record the color `C1` and the top-left coordinate (row, col) for each frame found.
3.  **Identify Pictures:** Locate all distinct (H-2)x(W-2) rectangular areas in the input grid that are predominantly composed of a single color, `C2`. Record the color `C2` and the top-left coordinate (row, col) for each picture found.
4.  **Pair Frames and Pictures:** For each identified Frame (color `C1`, position `P1`), find the unique Picture (color `C2`, position `P2`) whose bounding box is located spatially within the bounding box of the Frame in the input grid. Create pairs `(Frame(C1, P1), Picture(C2, P2))`.
5.  **Construct Combined Units:** For each pair `(Frame(C1, P1), Picture(C2, P2))`:
    a.  Create a new grid (the "unit") with dimensions HxW.
    b.  Fill the entire unit grid with the frame color `C1`.
    c.  Fill the inner (H-2)x(W-2) rectangle of the unit grid, starting at offset (1, 1) relative to the unit's top-left corner, with the picture color `C2`.
    d.  Store this constructed unit, associating it with the original frame position `P1`.
6.  **Assemble Output Grid:** Determine the grid layout of the frames based on their relative positions (`P1`) in the input (e.g., which frame was top-left, top-right, etc.). Arrange the corresponding constructed units according to this layout to form the final output grid. The dimensions of the output grid will depend on the number and arrangement of the units.
