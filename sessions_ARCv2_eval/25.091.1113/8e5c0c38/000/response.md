*   **Perception**:
    *   The input grids contain a dominant background color (azure '8' in train\_1, white '0' in train\_2).
    *   Several distinct objects, each composed of a single non-background color, are present on the background.
    *   The output grids retain the overall structure, background color, and the core shapes of the objects.
    *   Specific pixels from the non-background objects are removed (changed to the background color) in the output.
    *   The removed pixels appear to be those on the "edges" or "protrusions" of the objects. Specifically, they seem to be pixels that have only one neighbor of the same color (considering only horizontal and vertical adjacency).

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      grid_properties:
        - dimensions: Variable (e.g., 22x22 in examples)
        - background_color: The most frequent color in the input grid (azure '8' or white '0').
      objects:
        - type: Background
          properties:
            - color: Dominant color in the grid.
            - count: 1
        - type: Colored Shape
          properties:
            - color: Non-background colors (blue '1', red '2', magenta '6', azure '8', yellow '4').
            - structure: Contiguous blocks of a single color.
            - count: Multiple per grid.
            - location: Placed upon the background.
      relationships:
        - type: Adjacency
          definition: Pixels sharing an edge (up, down, left, right), not diagonal.
          relevance: Used to determine connectivity within an object.
      actions:
        - name: Identify Background Color
          inputs: Input grid
          outputs: Background color value
        - name: Identify Object Pixels
          inputs: Input grid, Background color
          outputs: Set of coordinates for each non-background pixel
        - name: Analyze Connectivity
          inputs: A non-background pixel's coordinates, Input grid
          outputs: Count of adjacent neighbors with the same color as the pixel.
        - name: Modify Pixel
          inputs: Pixel coordinates, Connectivity count, Background color
          condition: If connectivity count is less than 2 (i.e., 0 or 1).
          effect: Change the pixel's color to the background color.
          target: Output grid (initially a copy of the input grid).
    transformation_goal: Remove "weakly connected" pixels from each non-background object, where "weakly connected" means having fewer than two adjacent neighbors of the same color.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    2.  Determine the background color by finding the most frequent color in the input grid.
    3.  Iterate through each pixel (cell) of the input grid at `(row, col)` with color `C`.
    4.  If the pixel's color `C` is not the background color:
        a.  Count the number of adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right) that also have the color `C`.
        b.  If this count is less than 2:
            i.  Change the color of the pixel at `(row, col)` in the output grid to the background color.
    5.  Return the modified output grid.
