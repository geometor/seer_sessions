task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - type: 2D array
    - cell_values: integers 0-9 (colors)
    - dimensions: variable (up to 30x30)
  key_colors:
    - value: 3 (Green) - Primarily background, generally static.
    - value: 1 (Blue) - Represents objects or paths, subject to change.
    - value: 2 (Red) - Marker object, triggers changes, can change itself.
    - value: 0 (White) - Marker object, changes color.
objects:
  - type: contiguous block of same-colored pixels
  - relevant_colors: [Red (2), White (0), Blue (1)]
  - properties:
      - color
      - shape (implicitly defined by contiguous pixels)
      - dimensions (height, width)
      - position
relationships:
  - Red block size comparison: A Red block's dimensions (height, width) are compared to the dimensions of all Blue blocks.
  - Uniqueness: The transformation triggered by a Red block depends on finding a *unique* Blue block with matching dimensions.
actions:
  - Identify Blocks: Find all distinct contiguous blocks of Red, White, and Blue pixels.
  - Color Change (White -> Blue): All pixels within any identified White block are changed to Blue.
  - Color Change (Triggered by Red):
      - Condition: Find a unique Blue block with the same dimensions as the Red block.
      - Action (if condition met): Change all pixels of that *Blue* block to White.
      - Action (if condition not met): Change all pixels of the *Red* block itself to White.
invariance:
  - Grid dimensions remain constant between input and output.
  - Green (3) pixels generally remain unchanged.
  - Blue blocks not targeted by a Red block trigger remain unchanged (unless they were originally White).
