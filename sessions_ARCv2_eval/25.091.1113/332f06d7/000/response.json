Specifically, blocks of Red, White, and Blue pixels seem to be the primary actors or targets of the transformation.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation seems to involve changing the color of specific blocks based on the presence and properties (like size) of Red and White marker blocks.\n    *   White blocks consistently turn into Blue blocks of the same size and position.\n    *   Red blocks act as triggers. If there's a unique Blue block elsewhere in the grid with the *exact same dimensions* as the Red block, that Blue block turns White. If there isn't a unique matching Blue block, the original Red block itself turns White.\n5.  **Background:** The Green (3) pixels generally remain unchanged, forming the background or boundaries.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
