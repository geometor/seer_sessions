Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grid is consistently 30 rows by 22 columns. It features a gray (8) background.
2.  **Horizontal Lines:** There are two prominent horizontal lines made entirely of magenta (6) pixels in the input: one at row index 5 and another at row index 27. These lines divide the grid into three major regions: top (rows 0-4), middle (rows 6-26), and bottom (rows 28-29).
3.  **Objects/Panels:** Within the top and middle regions, there are distinct 5x5 "sub-panels" or areas containing small, colorful patterns (objects) surrounded by the gray background. These sub-panels are separated by single rows/columns of gray pixels. The bottom region (rows 28-29) is initially empty gray background.
4.  **Transformation Goal:** The primary transformation involves changing the color of the gray (8) background pixels in certain regions and potentially changing the color of the horizontal magenta lines.

**Observations from Examples:**

1.  **Line at Row 5:** This line consistently remains magenta (6) in the output
