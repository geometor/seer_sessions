task_context:
  grid_size: Input and output grids have the same dimensions, observed as 22x22 in the examples.
  background_color: Varies per example (white/0, yellow/4, blue/1). It is the most frequent color or the color at the corners.
  output_grid_init: Output grid is initialized with the background color of the input grid.

objects:
  - type: composite_square
    description: Consists of a frame and a center fill.
    properties:
      size: Typically 5x5 pixels.
      structure:
        - component: frame
          color: Varies (Azure/8 or Red/2 observed).
          thickness: 1 pixel.
          shape: Square outline.
        - component: center
          color: Varies (Gray/5, Blue/1, Green/3, Maroon/9, Magenta/6, Yellow/4, Red/2 observed).
          size: 3x3 pixels.
          shape: Solid square.
    identification: Contiguous block of non-background pixels matching the frame/center structure.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Objects are spatially distinct and separated by the background color in the input. They might be closer or overlap in the output after translation.

actions:
  - name: identify_background
    origin: Input grid analysis.
    target: background_color variable.
  - name: identify_objects
    origin: Input grid analysis.
    target: List of objects with properties (frame color, center color, location).
  - name: translate_object
    input: object (with frame color and location)
    output: new object location
    condition: Based on object's frame color.
      - if frame_color == Azure (8):
          new_column = old_column - 1
          new_row = old_row
      - if frame_color == Red (2):
          new_column = old_column + 5
          new_row = old_row
    notes: Translation is purely horizontal.
  - name: draw_object
    input: object (with frame color, center color, new location), output grid
    output: Modified output grid with the object drawn at the new location.
    notes: Pixels outside grid boundaries are clipped. The drawing overwrites existing pixels in the output grid.

goal:
  description: Translate specific objects horizontally based on their frame color and reconstruct the grid.
