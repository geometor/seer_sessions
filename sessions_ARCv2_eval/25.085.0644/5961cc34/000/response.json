The area defined by the minimum bounding box enclosing all blue and green pixels in the input is filled entirely with red (2) pixels in the output.\n        2.  The column containing the yellow pixel (and the red line below it) in the input is transformed into a solid vertical line of red (2) pixels spanning the entire height of the grid in the output.\n    *   Where these two transformed red areas overlap, the vertical line takes precedence, overwriting the bounding box fill.\n\n*   **Facts**\n    "
