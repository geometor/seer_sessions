perception:
  input_grid_properties:
    - The grid has a height and width, up to 30x30.
    - Pixel values range from 0 (white) to 9.
    - The pixel at coordinate (0, 0) serves as an indicator.
  objects:
    - Objects are contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color, connected via 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
    - White pixels (color 0) are considered background and do not form objects.
    - The indicator pixel at (0, 0) is treated specially and is not part of any other object identification process.
  relationships:
    - The color of the indicator pixel at (0, 0), let's call it C, determines a downward shift amount, S.
    - Other monochromatic objects in the grid may or may not have the same color C.
transformation:
  actions:
    - Determine the shift amount S based on the indicator color C:
      - If C is Maroon (9), S = 0.
      - If C is Magenta (6), S = 2.
      - For any other color C, S = 3.
    - If S = 0, the output grid is an identical copy of the input grid.
    - If S > 0:
      - Create a new output grid of the same size, filled with white (0).
      - Copy the indicator pixel C from input (0, 0) to output (0, 0).
      - Identify all monochromatic objects in the input grid (excluding the pixel at (0, 0)).
      - For each identified monochromatic object:
        - If the object's color is equal to C, discard the object (do not transfer its pixels).
        - If the object's color is not equal to C, transfer all its pixels to the output grid, shifting each pixel's row coordinate down by S. Pixels shifted beyond the grid's bottom boundary are discarded.
