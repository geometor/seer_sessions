            "text": "**CRITICAL Realization:** The code execution output reveals the flaw! My manual object identification was wrong. `find_objects` is finding only *one* large connected object in each of Examples 2-5 (because they are connected through adjacent non-white pixels, which I missed). Since this single object inevitably contains the indicator color (which exists *somewhere* in the grid other than (0,0)), the condition `if not obj['has_indicator_color']` is *always* false for this single object. Therefore, *no* pixels (except the indicator at (0,0)) are copied to the output grid, resulting in the mostly empty `Transformed Output`.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-evaluate the rule:** The rule cannot be \"remove objects containing the indicator color\". The expected outputs show shifting happens even when the indicator color is present elsewhere.\n2.  **Focus on the shift:** The shift amount calculation seems correct and consistent.\n    *   Maroon (9) -> Shift 0\n    *   Magenta (6) -> Shift 2\n    *   Others (e.g., Yellow 4, Orange 7) -> Shift 3\n3.  **Focus on what is *not* shifted:** In the examples where shifting occurs (2-5), compare the input and expected output carefully. What pixels *don't* make it to the output (aside from those shifted off the bottom)?\n    *   **Ex 2 (Indicator 4, Shift 3):**\n        *   Input Yellow line `(6,3),(6,4),(6,5)` is gone.\n        *   Input Yellow line `(9,10),(10,10),(11,10)` is gone.\n        *   All other non-white pixels seem to be shifted down by 3.\n    *   **Ex 3 (Indicator 6, Shift 2):**\n        *   Input Magenta line `(9,1),(10,1),(11,1)` is gone.\n        *   All other non-white pixels seem to be shifted down by 2.\n    *   **Ex 4 (Indicator 4, Shift 3):**\n        *   Input Yellow line `(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(11,1)` is gone.\n        *   All other non-white pixels seem to be shifted down by 3.\n    *   **Ex 5 (Indicator 7, Shift 3):**\n        *   Input Gray/Orange `U` shape (containing 7) is gone. Note: pixels are (6,7),(7,7),(8,7), (6,9),(7,9),(8,9), (6,8). All contain 7 or are part of object containing 7. Wait, no. (6,8) is gray(5). (6,9) is gray(5). (7,9) is gray(5). Okay, my mental check was wrong, let's use the actual coords.\n            *   Object 4 (my old numbering): Pixels `(6,7)`(O), `(7,7)`(O), `(8,7)`(O), `(6,8)`(G), `(6,9)`(G), `(7,9)`(G), `(8,9)`(G). Colors {Orange(7), Gray(5)}. Contains Orange(7). This whole object seems gone.\n        *   Input Orange line `(8,10),(9,10),(10,10),(11,10)` is gone.\n        *   All other non-white pixels seem to be shifted down by 3.\n\n4.  **Refined Hypothesis:** Identify all distinct connected non-white objects (ignoring the pixel at (0,0)). For *each pixel* in the input grid (excluding (0,0)), determine the object it belongs to. If that object contains the indicator color `C`, *do not* copy this pixel to the output. If the object does *not* contain the indicator color `C`, copy the pixel to the output grid, shifted down by `S` rows (if it remains within bounds).\n\nThis matches the original code's *intent* but clarifies why it failed: the implementation incorrectly grouped pixels. The `find_objects` implementation is correct for finding connected components, but the interpretation of \"object\" might need refinement, or perhaps the filtering step needs to happen differently.\n\nWait, let's re-read the code output for `find_objects`. It found *one* object for each grid (Ex 2-5). This means all non-white pixels (except (0,0)) are connected in those examples. If that's true, and the indicator color `C` is present *anywhere* in that single large object, then the rule \"remove objects containing C\" would indeed remove *everything*. This matches the code's output but *not* the expected output.\n\n**Possible Scenarios:**\n\n1.  **Connectivity Definition:** Is connectivity 4-directional or 8-directional? The code uses 4-directional. Does the problem imply 8-directional? Let's check Ex 2 again. Are all non-white pixels connected via 4-way adjacency?\n    *   Pixel (2,5) (Blue) connects to (2,6) (Gray).\n    *   (2,6) connects to (2,7) (Gray) -> (2,8) (Gray) -> (2,9) (Azure).\n    *   (2,9) connects to (3,9) (Azure) -> (4,9) (Azure) -> (5,9) (Azure).\n    *   ... This seems very likely that they are all connected with 4-way adjacency.\n2.  **The \"Object\" concept:** Maybe an \"object\" isn't just a connected component of *any* non-white color. Maybe it's a connected component of the *same* color? Let's re-read the priors: \"An object can be considered a contiguous block of one or more pixels of the same color.\" This contradicts the BFS implementation which groups *any* adjacent non-white pixels.\n\n**Revised Hypothesis 2:**\n\n1.  Determine indicator color `C` and shift `S` as before.\n2.  If `S == 0`, return copy.\n3.  If `S > 0`:\n    *   Find all distinct connected objects composed of pixels of the *same* color (ignoring the pixel at (0,0) and white pixels).\n    *   For each such monochromatic object:\n        *   If the object's color is equal to the indicator color `C`, *remove* this object (do not copy its pixels).\n        *   If the object's color is *not* equal to the indicator color `C`, shift all pixels of this object down by `S` rows, copying them to the output grid (within bounds).\n    *   Copy the indicator pixel `C` to `(0,0)` in the output.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis on Example 2 (Indicator 4 - Yellow, Shift 3):\n*   Monochromatic objects (ignoring (0,0)):\n    *   Blue 'L' shape (color 2) -> Keep & Shift\n    *   Gray block (color 5) -> Keep & Shift\n    *   Azure 'L' shape (color 8) -> Keep & Shift\n    *   Maroon line (color 9) -> Keep & Shift\n    *   Yellow line (color 4) at row 6 -> Color matches indicator -> Remove\n    *   Orange line (color 7) -> Keep & Shift\n    *   Red pixels (color 2) -> Keep & Shift\n    *   Green pixels (color 3) -> Keep & Shift\n    *   Magenta line (color 6) -> Keep & Shift\n    *   Gray block (color 5) -> Keep & Shift\n    *   Blue line (color 1) -> Keep & Shift\n    *   Orange block (color 7) -> Keep & Shift\n    *   Yellow line (color 4) at rows 9-11 -> Color matches indicator -> Remove\n*   Result: Shift all objects except the two Yellow ones. This matches the expected output for Example 2.\n\nLet's test on Example 3 (Indicator 6 - Magenta, Shift 2):\n*   Monochromatic objects: Same as above.\n*   Indicator is Magenta (6).\n*   Remove the Magenta line (color 6). Shift all others. This matches the expected output for Example 3.\n\nLet's test on Example 4 (Indicator 4 - Yellow, Shift 3):\n*   Monochromatic objects (different grid now):\n    *   Gray/Blue 'U' shape (Is this monochromatic? No. It contains 5 and 1). Let's re-run the \"find monochromatic objects\" idea.\n        *   Find connected pixels of color 5. Find connected pixels of color 1. etc.\n    *   Grid:\n        "

Shift all others down by 3. This matches the expected output for Example 4.\n\nLet's test on Example 5 (Indicator 7 - Orange, Shift 3):\n*   Same monochromatic objects as Example 4.\n*   Indicator is Orange (7).\n*   Remove the Orange objects: {(5,9),(6,9),(7,9)} and {(8,10),(9,10),(10,10),(11,10)}.\n*   Shift all others down by 3. This matches the expected output for Example 5.\n\n**Conclusion:** The revised hypothesis (finding monochromatic objects and removing those whose color matches the indicator) works for all examples. The previous code failed because its `find_objects` grouped connected pixels of *different* colors, violating the \"object = same color\" prior and leading to incorrect filtering.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (Based on Revised Hypothesis):**\n\nNeed to implement a function to find monochromatic objects.\n\n"

It used a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find connected components of *any* non-white color. However, the analysis of failed examples, combined with the ARC prior knowledge (\"An object can be considered a contiguous block of one or more pixels of the same color\"), strongly suggests that objects should be defined as connected components of pixels of the *same* color (monochromatic objects).\n\nThe previous code found only one large connected object in examples 2-5. Since the indicator color was present somewhere within this large object, the filtering rule (`if not obj['has_indicator_color']`) caused the entire object (effectively all non-white pixels except the indicator at (0,0)) to be discarded, leading to empty outputs.\n\nThe new strategy is to redefine object detection to find monochromatic objects. The transformation rule then becomes: identify the indicator color C and corresponding shift S. Find all monochromatic objects (ignoring (0,0)). Remove objects whose color is C. Shift all remaining objects down by S.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe following metrics were gathered using the `find_mono_objects` function based on the revised understanding:\n\n"
