Finds all adjacent (including diagonal) yellow (4) pixels, marking them as the border.\n2. Determines if the area enclosed by the border (including the original blue pixels and potentially some yellow pixels) contained only blue pixels or both blue and yellow pixels in the input.\n   - \"Enclosed\" yellow pixels are those yellow pixels in the input that are not part of the border and are not reachable from the grid edges without crossing the border or the blue object. This is determined using a flood fill from the edges.\n3. If the enclosed area was originally only blue (no enclosed yellow pixels found):\n   - Change the border pixels to red (2).\n   - The original blue pixels remain blue (1).\n4. If the enclosed area was originally blue and yellow (enclosed yellow pixels were found):\n   - Change the border pixels to red (2).\n   - Change the original blue pixels to azure (8).\n   - Change the enclosed yellow pixels:\n     -
