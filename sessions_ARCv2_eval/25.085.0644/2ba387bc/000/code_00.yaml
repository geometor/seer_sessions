objects:
  - type: grid
    description: Input grid containing scattered patterns.
  - type: grid
    description: Output grid containing rearranged patterns.
  - type: pattern
    subtype: square_4x4
    properties:
      - solid: True if all 16 pixels are the same non-white color.
      - hollow: True if the 12 border pixels are the same non-white color and the 4 inner pixels are white.
      - color: The non-white color used in the pattern.
      - position: The top-left (row, column) coordinates in the input grid.

actions:
  - identify: Find all non-overlapping 4x4 patterns in the input grid that are either 'solid' or 'hollow'.
  - classify: Determine if each identified pattern is 'solid' or 'hollow'.
  - sort:
      - Separate patterns into two groups: 'hollow' and 'solid'.
      - Sort each group based on their original top-left row coordinate, then column coordinate.
  - arrange:
      - Create a new output grid with width 8 and height determined by `max(count(hollow), count(solid)) * 4`.
      - Place sorted 'hollow' patterns sequentially down the left column (columns 0-3) of the output grid.
      - Place sorted 'solid' patterns sequentially down the right column (columns 4-7) of the output grid.
  - pad: Fill any remaining space in the output grid (due to unequal numbers of hollow and solid patterns) with white pixels.

relationships:
  - The output grid's content is derived solely from the 'solid' and 'hollow' 4x4 patterns found in the input grid.
  - The relative vertical order of patterns of the same type (solid/hollow) is preserved from the input to the output.
  - Hollow patterns are always placed to the left of solid patterns in the output.
