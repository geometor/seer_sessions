Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple distinct objects or regions. These regions are often separated by a background color or separator lines.
2.  **Object Types:** Two main types of objects seem relevant:
    *   **Frame Objects:** These are typically rectangular regions defined by a specific border color. Inside these borders, there's a pattern composed of a different, consistent "placeholder" color.
    *   **Content Objects:** These are smaller shapes, often monochromatic, found elsewhere in the grid, usually within areas dominated by the same "placeholder" color seen inside the Frame objects.
3.  **Placeholder Color:** There's a specific color in each input grid that acts as both the internal pattern color for Frame objects and the background/embedding color for Content objects. In `train_1`, this is Azure (8). In `train_2`, this is Red (2). This placeholder color seems to be the most frequent color in the grid besides the frame/content colors, or the color separating the main defined objects.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves modifying the Frame objects based on the Content objects. Specifically, the placeholder color pixels *inside* each Frame object are replaced with the color of a corresponding Content object. The shape of the internal pattern is preserved.
5.  **Pairing:** A crucial step is pairing each Frame object with a specific Content object. The examples suggest this pairing is based on relative spatial relationships:
    *   In `train_1`, the left Frame (Blue) is paired with the left Content (Red), and the right Frame (Yellow) with the right Content (Green).
    *   In `train_2`, a more complex mapping appears: Top-Left Frame (Yellow) pairs with Content found in the top-right region (Maroon). Top-Right Frame (Green) pairs with Content in the bottom-right region (Orange). Mid-Left Frame (Azure) pairs with Content in the bottom-left region (Blue). Mid-Right Frame (Blue) pairs with Content in the mid-right region (Gray). This suggests a mapping rule might exist between the region where a Content object is found and the Frame object it modifies.
6.  **Output Structure:** The output grid consists of the modified Frame objects, arranged spatially relative to how the original Frame objects were arranged in the input. The placeholder background/separators and the original Content objects are omitted. The output grid's size is determined by the size and arrangement of these modified Frame objects.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input Grid:
  - Contains multiple distinct regions/objects.
  - Features a dominant 'placeholder' color (P) that often acts as background or separator. (Azure 8 in Ex1, Red 2 in Ex2).

Objects:
  - Frame Objects:
    - Properties:
      - Have a border of a non-placeholder color (C_frame).
      - Contain an internal pattern composed of the placeholder color (P).
      - Have a specific location/bounding box in the input grid.
    - Examples:
      - Ex1: Blue(1) frame, Yellow(4) frame.
      - Ex2: Yellow(4), Green(3), Azure(8), Blue(1) frames.
  - Content Objects:
    - Properties:
      - Composed of a single, non-placeholder color (C_content).
      - Located within regions predominantly filled with the placeholder color (P).
      - Have a specific location/bounding box in the input grid.
    - Examples:
      - Ex1: Red(2) shape, Green(3) shape.
      - Ex2: Maroon(9), Orange(7), Blue(1), Gray(5) shapes.

Relationships:
  - Pairing: Each Frame object is paired with exactly one Content object.
  - Pairing Rule: Based on relative spatial locations of the Frame object and the region containing the Content object.
    - Ex1 Rule: Match horizontal position (Left Frame <-> Left Content, Right Frame <-> Right Content).
    - Ex2 Rule: Seems to be a fixed mapping based on quadrant/region (e.g., Content in Top-Right region modifies Top-Left Frame).
  - Spatial Arrangement: Frame objects have relative positions (e.g., Top-Left, Top-Right) in the input.

Actions:
  - Identify Placeholder Color (P): Find the color used for internal frame patterns and content backgrounds.
  - Identify Frame Objects: Locate regions with non-P borders and P internal patterns.
  - Identify Content Objects: Locate non-P shapes within P-dominated areas.
  - Pair Frames and Contents: Apply the spatial pairing rule.
  - Modify Frame Objects:
    - For each (Frame, Content) pair:
      - Keep the Frame's border color (C_frame).
      - Replace the pixels of the internal pattern that have color P with the Content's color (C_content).
  - Construct Output Grid: Arrange the modified Frame objects according to their original relative positions, excluding other elements from the input.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Analyze Input:** Scan the input grid to identify the distinct colors present.
2.  **Identify Placeholder Color:** Determine the 'placeholder' color (P). This is likely the color that fills the inside pattern of framed objects and surrounds standalone 'content' shapes. It might be the most frequent color apart from those forming the frames and content shapes, or the primary separator color.
3.  **Find Frame Objects:** Locate all rectangular objects that have a border of a single color (C\_frame) different from P, and whose interior contains a pattern made solely of the placeholder color P. Record the border color, the relative coordinates of the internal P pattern within the frame, and the frame's overall position.
4.  **Find Content Objects:** Locate all contiguous shapes composed of a single color (C\_content) different from P, which are situated within areas predominantly filled with the placeholder color P. Record the color (C\_content) and the location/region of each content object.
5.  **Pair Frame and Content Objects:** Establish a one-to-one mapping between Frame objects and Content objects based on their relative spatial positions or the positions of the regions they occupy. (e.g., match horizontally, or use a quadrant-based mapping like "Content found in the top-right placeholder region pairs with the top-left Frame").
6.  **Transform Frame Objects:** For each matched pair (Frame, Content):
    a.  Create a new grid corresponding to the Frame's dimensions.
    b.  Fill the border with the Frame's border color (C\_frame).
    c.  Fill the interior pixels corresponding to the Frame's original internal P pattern with the Content object's color (C\_content).
    d.  Fill any remaining interior pixels (that were not part of the P pattern) with the Frame's border color (C\_frame).
7.  **Assemble Output:** Arrange the transformed Frame objects in a new grid, maintaining the same relative spatial arrangement they had in the input grid. The final output grid's dimensions will be determined by this arrangement.
