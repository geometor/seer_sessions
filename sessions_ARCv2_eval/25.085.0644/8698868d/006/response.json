            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided Python code attempted to solve the task by identifying hollow rectangular frames and replacing an internal placeholder color with a content color derived from the interior. However, the execution results show a complete failure to produce the expected outputs for the provided training examples. The generated outputs are significantly different in size and content, indicating a fundamental misunderstanding of the transformation rule.\n\nThe core issue seems to be the oversimplified logic applied. While identifying frames is likely a correct first step, the way content and placeholder colors were determined and applied, and especially how the final output grid was constructed (size, composition), did not match the examples.\n\nThe strategy for resolution is to re-analyze the examples focusing on:\n1.  **Identifying all key objects**: Not just frames, but also potentially other shapes or regions that influence the output.\n2.  **Determining the placeholder color**: Find a robust method based on its presence across relevant objects.\n3.  **Understanding the role of different objects**: Some objects (frames) seem to be kept and modified (\"Target Frames\"), while others provide the modification color and are discarded (\"Content Source Frames\").\n4.  **Establishing the mapping**: How is a specific Content Source Frame's color assigned to fill a specific Target Frame?\n5.  **Output construction**: How are the final dimensions and content determined based on the kept objects?\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze the examples to extract key properties.\n\n"
