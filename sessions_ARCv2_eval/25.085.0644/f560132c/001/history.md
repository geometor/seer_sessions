Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input is a grid containing several distinct objects (connected areas of the same non-white color) on a white background.
2.  **Key Element:** In each input grid, there appears to be one special "container" object. This container object is unique because it encloses other pixels of different non-white colors within its boundary. Other objects in the input grid seem to be irrelevant to the transformation.
    *   In `train_1`, the container is the red (2) object enclosing blue (1), gray (5), azure (8), and maroon (9) pixels.
    *   In `train_2`, the container is the magenta (6) object enclosing red (2), yellow (4), azure (8), and green (3) pixels.
3.  **Content Pixels:** The pixels enclosed within the container object, which are neither the container's color nor the white background, seem crucial. Let's call these "content pixels".
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves extracting these content pixels, determining their spatial arrangement relative to each other, and then scaling up this arrangement to produce the output grid.
5.  **Scaling:** The content pixels form a small grid (2x2 in both examples). This small grid is scaled up to create the larger output grid. The scaling factor appears to be determined by the dimensions of the *container object's* bounding box. Specifically, the scale factor seems to be `min(container_height, container_width) - 1`.
    *   `train_1`: Red container bounding box is 5x5. `min(5, 5) - 1 = 4`. Content grid is 2x2. Output grid is (2*4)x(2*4) = 8x8.
    *   `train_2`: Magenta container bounding box is 8x6. `min(8, 6) - 1 = 5`. Content grid is 2x2. Output grid is (2*5)x(2*5) = 10x10.
6.  **Output Generation:** Each content pixel from the input is expanded into a solid block of `scale_factor x scale_factor` pixels in the output grid, maintaining the relative positions of the original content pixels.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation based on Content Extraction and Scaling

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Objects: Contiguous areas of non-white pixels.
  - Background: White pixels (color 0).
  - Container_Object:
      - Property: Is a non-white object.
      - Property: Contains other non-white pixels (Content_Pixels) within its bounding box that are not its own color.
      - Property: Appears to be unique in each input example.
      - Property: Its bounding box dimensions (Height_C, Width_C) are used to determine the scaling factor.
  - Content_Pixels:
      - Property: Located within the bounding box of the Container_Object.
      - Property: Color is not white (0) and not the color of the Container_Object.
      - Property: Their relative spatial arrangement forms a smaller grid (Content_Grid).
      - Property: Dimensions of Content_Grid (Height_Cont, Width_Cont).
  - Other_Objects: Non-white objects that are not the Container_Object; seem irrelevant to the output.

Transformation_Properties:
  - Action: Identify the unique Container_Object.
  - Action: Extract the Content_Pixels within the Container_Object's bounding box.
  - Action: Determine the grid structure (Content_Grid) formed by the Content_Pixels and its dimensions (Height_Cont, Width_Cont).
  - Action: Calculate the scaling factor `S = min(Height_C, Width_C) - 1`.
  - Action: Generate an output grid of size `(Height_Cont * S) x (Width_Cont * S)`.
  - Action: Map each Content_Pixel to an `S x S` block in the output grid, preserving relative positions.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels.
  - Structure: Composed of solid blocks of color.
  - Colors: Derived exclusively from the Content_Pixels of the input.
  - Dimensions: Determined by `(Height_Cont * S) x (Width_Cont * S)`.

Relationships:
  - Container_Object contains Content_Pixels.
  - Container_Object dimensions determine the Scale_Factor.
  - Content_Grid structure and colors determine the Output_Grid structure and colors.
  - Scale_Factor determines the size of the blocks in the Output_Grid and its overall dimensions relative to the Content_Grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Find the Container:** Scan the input grid to identify all connected components (objects) of non-white pixels. For each object, determine its color and find its bounding box. Identify the unique object (the "Container") whose bounding box contains pixels of colors other than white and the object's own color.
2.  **Extract Content:** Collect all such contained pixels within the Container's bounding box; these are the "Content Pixels".
3.  **Determine Content Grid:** Find the minimal bounding box enclosing only the Content Pixels. Note the relative arrangement and colors of the Content Pixels within this minimal bounding box. Let the dimensions of this content grid be `H_content` x `W_content`.
4.  **Calculate Scale Factor:** Get the height (`H_C`) and width (`W_C`) of the bounding box of the Container object identified in step 1. Calculate the scale factor `S = minimum(H_C, W_C) - 1`.
5.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an output grid with dimensions `(H_content * S) x (W_content * S)`.
6.  **Populate Output Grid:** For each Content Pixel located at relative coordinates `(r, c)` (where `r` is the row index from the top, `c` is the column index from the left within the content grid) with color `Color_P`:
    *   Fill the rectangular block in the output grid spanning rows from `r * S` to `(r + 1) * S - 1` and columns from `c * S` to `(c + 1) * S - 1` with `Color_P`.
7.  **Final Output:** The fully populated grid is the result.
