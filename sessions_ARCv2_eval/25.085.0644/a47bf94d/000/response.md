Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception:**

The input grids contain various shapes and patterns composed of different colored pixels against a white background. Some recurring shapes are solid 3x3 squares of a single color (e.g., green, red, blue, yellow, magenta). Other shapes are more complex or irregular (e.g., azure 'L' shapes, gray/maroon patterns).

Comparing the input and output grids, the key transformation appears to be applied selectively to the solid 3x3 squares. Specifically, the central pixel of each identified 3x3 solid square is changed to white (0) in the output grid, effectively creating a hollow square or frame. All other pixels and shapes in the grid remain unchanged in their color and position. The transformation is applied consistently across all examples, regardless of the color of the 3x3 square or its proximity to other shapes.

**Facts:**


```yaml
- task: process_grid
  description: Modifies specific objects within the input grid based on their shape and composition.
  objects:
    - type: solid_square
      attributes:
        - size: 3x3 pixels
        - composition: uniform single non-white color (color varies, e.g., green, red, blue, yellow, magenta)
        - location: variable within the grid
    - type: background
      attributes:
        - color: white (0)
    - type: other_patterns
      attributes:
        - shape: variable (e.g., lines, L-shapes, complex structures)
        - composition: single or multiple non-white colors
        - location: variable within the grid
  actions:
    - name: hollow_out_square
      target: solid_square
      effect: Changes the central pixel of the 3x3 square to white (0).
      condition: The object must be a 3x3 solid square of a single non-white color.
    - name: copy_pixel
      target: background, other_patterns, pixels not part of the center of a target solid_square
      effect: Copies the pixel value from the input to the output at the same coordinates.
      condition: The pixel is not the center of an identified 3x3 solid square.
  relationships:
    - The transformation applies only to objects matching the 'solid_square' description.
    - All other objects and background pixels ('other_patterns', 'background') are preserved.
    - The transformation occurs in place; the output grid has the same dimensions as the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to identify all instances of 3x3 subgrids.
3.  For each 3x3 subgrid located starting at row `r` and column `c`:
    a.  Check if all 9 pixels within this subgrid (from `(r, c)` to `(r+2, c+2)`) have the same non-white color.
    b.  If they do, it signifies a solid 3x3 square. Modify the corresponding pixel in the output grid at the center of this square (coordinates `(r+1, c+1)`) by setting its color to white (0).
4.  Return the modified output grid.
