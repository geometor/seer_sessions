            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** Contains a background color (azure, 8), a single \"start\" pixel (green, 3), and one or more \"barrier\" lines/shapes composed of red (2) and blue (1) pixels. These barrier shapes can be straight lines (horizontal or vertical) or more complex, potentially L-shaped (though not explicitly shown in trains, the possibility exists if lines meet). The lines involving blue often have alternating blue/red patterns or blue pixels at the ends.\n2.  **Output Grid:** The background remains azure (8). The original green pixel (3) remains. The barrier shapes from the input are present but are now entirely red (2) - any blue pixels within them have been converted to red. A new region of green (3) pixels appears, connected to the original green pixel.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves two main steps:\n    *   **Barrier Solidification:** The blue pixels within the barrier shapes are changed to red.\n    *   **Region Filling:** Starting from the original green pixel, a fill operation colors all reachable azure pixels green, stopping at the now-solid-red barriers and the grid boundaries.\n4.  **Objects & Properties:**\n    *   **Background:** Azure pixels (8), representing empty space.\n    *   **Start Point:** A single green pixel (3), acting as the origin for the fill.\n    *   **Barriers:** Contiguous shapes of red (2) and blue (1) pixels. In the output, they become solid red (2) walls.\n    *   **Filled Region:** New green pixels (3) in the output, representing the area reachable from the start point without crossing barriers.\n5.  **Relationships & Actions:**\n    *   Blue pixels within barrier shapes are *unified* to red.\n    *   The start point *initiates* a fill action.\n    *   The red barriers *constrain* the fill action.\n    *   Azure pixels *connected* to the start point (without crossing barriers) are *transformed* to green.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

For each identified shape, change the color of all blue (1) pixels within that shape to red (2) in the output grid. These red shapes now form solid barriers.\n4.  Find the coordinates (row, column) of the single green (3) pixel in the input grid. This is the starting point for the fill.\n5.  Perform a flood fill operation on the output grid, starting from the identified green pixel's coordinates:\n    *   Use a queue or stack for pending locations, initially containing the start coordinates.\n    *   Maintain a set of visited coordinates to avoid cycles and redundant processing.\n    *   While the queue/stack is not empty:\n        *   Dequeue/pop a coordinate (r, c).\n        *   If (r, c) is outside grid boundaries, or has already been visited, or the pixel at (r, c) is red (2), continue to the next iteration.\n        *   Mark (r, c) as visited.\n        *   If the pixel at (r, c) is azure (8), change its color to green (3) in the output grid.\n        *   Add its four neighbors (up, down, left, right) to the queue/stack: (r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1).\n6.
