Barrier Solidification: Create a copy of the input grid. In this copy, change all blue pixels (1) to red pixels (2). Original red pixels (2) remain red. These red pixels form barriers.\n2. Find Source: Locate the single green pixel (3) in the *original* input grid. This is the source for the fill.\n3. Flood Fill: Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the source pixel.\n    *   The BFS explores adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n    *   A cell can be entered and processed only if it meets all these conditions:\n        *   It is within the grid boundaries.\n        *   It has not been visited by the BFS yet.\n        *   Its color in the *modified grid* (after barrier solidification) is *not* red (2).\n        *   Its color in the *original input grid* was azure (8).\n    *   When a valid cell is visited:\n        *   Mark it as visited.\n        *   Change its color in the *modified grid* to green (3).\n        *   Add it to the BFS queue to explore from it later.\n4. Output: The final grid is the modified grid after the BFS is complete. Only original azure pixels reachable from the source green pixel through a path of other original azure pixels (without crossing barriers) are turned green.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies barrier solidification and a constrained flood fill transformation\n    where the fill only propagates through originally azure cells.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.array): A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.array: A 2D numpy array representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = output_grid.shape\n\n    # --- 1.
