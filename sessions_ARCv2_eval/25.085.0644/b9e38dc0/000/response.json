            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\nObserving the three training pairs, a common theme emerges: a \"fill\" operation occurs, changing the color of certain background pixels based on boundaries and a specific \"source\" color found elsewhere in the input grid.\n\n1.  **Example 1:** The input has a blue background (1), a green shape (3) acting as a boundary, two gray pixels (5) also acting as boundaries within the green shape, and a single maroon pixel (9) inside the green shape. The output shows the area inside the green shape, previously blue, filled with maroon (9), starting from the original maroon pixel and stopping at the green and gray boundaries. This suggests a flood fill operation.\n2.  **Example 2:** The input has a white background (0), scattered gray pixels (5), and a single yellow pixel (4). The output shows the area to the left of the leftmost gray pixel in each row filled with yellow (4), replacing the white background. The gray pixels act as rightward boundaries for the fill in each row. The fill color comes from the unique yellow pixel.\n3.  **Example 3:** The input has an orange background (7), various maroon pixels (9) forming shapes including two prominent vertical lines, a small green L-shape (3), and single magenta (6) and azure (8) pixels. The output shows the area *between* the two main vertical maroon lines filled with green (3), replacing the orange background. Other non-background pixels (maroon, magenta, green, azure) within this area are preserved. The fill color seems derived from the green L-shape object. The maroon lines act as boundaries for the filled region.\n\nIn all cases:\n*   A background color is identified (most frequent color).\n*   Boundary elements are identified (non-background colors forming shapes or lines).\n*   A specific fill color is identified (often from a unique, non-boundary, non-background pixel or small object).\n*   A region is filled with this fill color, replacing the background color, respecting the boundaries and any other existing non-background pixels. The method of defining the region varies (flood fill from source, fill left-of boundary, fill between boundaries).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify all non-background colors and the pixels/objects associated with them.\n3.  Analyze the shapes and positions of the non-background objects to determine the primary boundary structure (e.g., an enclosing loop, parallel lines, scattered blockers). Note the color(s) forming this primary boundary.\n4.  Identify the fill color source: Find the color(s) that are neither the background color nor the primary boundary color(s). If there is only one such color, that is the fill color. If there are multiple, select the color belonging to the largest distinct object among them (or apply task-specific criteria if needed, like in example 3 where green (3) is chosen over magenta (6) and azure (8)).\n5.  Determine the fill region and mechanism based on the boundary structure and the location of the fill color source (if applicable):\n    *   If the boundary forms a closed loop and the fill source is inside, the region is the area inside the loop reachable from the source without crossing the boundary or other non-background pixels. The mechanism is flood fill from the source.\n    *   If the boundary consists of elements acting as barriers relative to the grid edges (like in example 2), the region is defined relative to these barriers (e.g., pixels to the left of the first barrier in each row).\n    *   If the boundary consists of structures defining a channel or space between them (like in example 3), the region is the area between these structures.\n6.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n7.  Iterate through all pixels within the determined fill region in the output grid. If a pixel's color matches the background color, change it to the identified fill color. Leave all other pixels (boundary pixels, preserved pixels) unchanged."
