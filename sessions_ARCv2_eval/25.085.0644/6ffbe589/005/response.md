"""
Transforms an input grid by focusing on the main non-white object and 
generating an output grid based on its bounding box. The content within the
bounding box is extracted, but further transformation is likely needed to 
match the target output precisely.

1. Identify all 8-way connected components of non-white pixels.
2. Find the component with the largest bounding box area.
3. Determine the bounding box of this target component.
4. Extract the portion of the input grid corresponding to this bounding box.
5. Return this extracted portion as the current transformation result. 
   (Note: This may be an intermediate step, requiring further processing based 
   on local rules within the extracted grid to match the final expected output).
