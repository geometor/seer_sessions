Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Grids**: The task takes a larger input grid (20x20 in the examples) and produces a smaller output grid. The output grid's dimensions vary between examples (13x13, 10x10).
2.  **Content**: Both input and output grids contain pixels of various colors on a white (0) background.
3.  **Structure in Input**: The input grids typically feature one large, central structure composed of connected non-white pixels. This structure often has a distinct border color (green in train_1, gray in train_2, yellow in train_3) enclosing other colors. Additionally, there are often smaller, isolated non-white pixels or small groups of pixels scattered elsewhere in the input grid, separate from the main structure.
4.  **Transformation**: The output grid appears to be a direct copy of the content within the main central structure found in the input grid. The isolated pixels or groups outside this main structure are excluded. The transformation is essentially a cropping operation focused on the most significant object.
5.  **Object Identification**: The key seems to be identifying the "main object". Based on the examples, this main object is the largest connected component (group) of non-white pixels. Connectivity includes diagonal adjacency (8-way connectivity).
6.  **Cropping Mechanism**: The boundaries of the output grid correspond precisely to the minimal bounding box enclosing the largest connected component of non-white pixels in the input grid.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: object_extraction_cropping
input_properties:
  - size: Typically larger (e.g., 20x20)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - elements:
      - Multiple connected components of non-white pixels.
      - One component is significantly larger than others.
output_properties:
  - size: Variable, smaller than input. Determined by the bounding box of the main object.
  - content: A subgrid copied directly from the input.
pertinent_objects:
  - main_object:
      definition: The largest connected component of non-white pixels in the input grid (using 8-way connectivity).
      role: Defines the content and boundaries of the output grid.
  - other_objects:
      definition: Smaller connected components or isolated non-white pixels.
      role: Ignored during the transformation.
transformation:
  - step_1: Identify all connected components of non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - step_2: Determine the component with the largest number of pixels (the main_object).
  - step_3: Calculate the minimal bounding box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col) that encloses all pixels of the main_object.
  - step_4: Extract the subgrid from the input defined by this bounding box.
  - step_5: The extracted subgrid is the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Examine the input grid and identify all contiguous groups (connected components) of non-white pixels. Consider pixels connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (8-way connectivity) as part of the same group.
2.  Count the number of pixels in each identified group.
3.  Select the group that contains the largest number of pixels. This is the "main object".
4.  Determine the top-most row index, bottom-most row index, left-most column index, and right-most column index occupied by any pixel belonging to this main object. These four indices define the minimal bounding box of the main object.
5.  Create a new grid whose dimensions match the height (bottom_row - top_row + 1) and width (right_col - left_col + 1) of the calculated bounding box.
6.  Copy the pixels from the input grid within the bounding box (from `top_row` to `bottom_row` and `left_col` to `right_col`) into the new grid, preserving their relative positions.
7.  The resulting new grid is the final output.
