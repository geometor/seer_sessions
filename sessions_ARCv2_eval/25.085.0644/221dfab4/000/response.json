            "text": "Ah, skimage is not available. Let's try using standard neighbor checks to find objects. This will be more complex to implement within the tool. Maybe I can infer the objects visually and re-test the hypothesis.\n\n**Rethinking without `skimage`:**\n\nLet's manually list the azure objects in input 1 and see what happens to them in output 1.\n\nInput Azure Objects (visually grouped, connectivity=1):\n1.  Coords: (1,11), (1,12) - Size 2. BBox=(1,1,11,12). Overlaps cols 11-14? Yes. Output: Seems gone? Replaced by blue (1)? Or merged into output green obj at (0, 11-14)?\n2.  Coords: (2,7)-(2,17), (3,8)-(3,17), (4,13)-(4,16) - Size 11+10+4=25. BBox=(2,4,7,17). Overlaps cols 11-14? Yes. Output: (2,7-10) azure, (2,11-14) yellow, (2,15-17) azure. (3,8-10) azure, (3,11-14) blue??, (3,15-17) azure. (4,13-14) yellow, (4,15-16) azure.\n3.  Coords: (6,4)-(6,6) - Size 3. BBox=(6,6,4,6). Overlaps cols 11-14? No. Output: (6,4-6) green. Matches!\n4.  Coords: (7,4)-(7,10) - Size 7. BBox=(7,7,4,10). Overlaps cols 11-14? No. Output: (7,4-10) azure? No, output has azure at (7,4-10) AND azure at (8,3-10), (9,2-10), (10,3-7). This means these are likely one larger object in the input.\n    Let's regroup:\n    Obj 4 (revised): (7,4-10), (8,3-17), (9,2-10), (10,3-7) - BBox=(7,10,2,17). Overlaps cols 11-14? Yes (via row 8).\n    Output check for Obj 4:\n    - Row 7: (7,4-10) azure.\n    - Row 8: (8,3-10) azure, (8,11-14) yellow, (8,15-17) azure.\n    - Row 9: (9,2-10) azure.\n    - Row 10: (10,3-7) azure.\n    Hypothesis: Parts in cols 11-14 -> yellow. Parts outside -> azure. Matches!\n5.  Coords: (11,15)-(11,16) - Size 2. BBox=(11,11,15,16). Overlaps cols 11-14? No. Output: (11,15-16) azure. No match (expected green).\n6.  Coords: (12,9)-(12,17), (13,9)-(13,17), (14,13)-(14,16) - BBox=(12,14,9,17). Overlaps cols 11-14? Yes.\n    Output check:\n    - Row 12: (12,9-17) green?? Expected yellow/azure split. No match.\n    - Row 13: (13,9-10) azure, (13,11-14) blue??, (13,15-17) azure. Expected yellow/azure split. No match.\n    - Row 14: (14,13-14) yellow, (14,15-16) azure. Matches. (Input (14,13-16)).\n7.  Coords: (16,4)-(16,6) - Size 3. BBox=(16,16,4,6). Overlaps cols 11-14? No. Output: (16,4-6) azure? No, output has (16,4-6) azure and (17,2-10) azure. Another merged object.\n    Obj 7 (revised): (16,4-6), (17,2-10), (17,15-16), (18,2-11), (18,15-17), (19,2-11), (20,7-9) - BBox=(16,20,2,17). Overlaps cols 11-14? Yes (via row 18).\n    Output check:\n    - Row 16: (16,4-6) azure. Parts in cols 11-14 -> yellow. Parts outside -> azure. Okay.\n    - Row 17: (17,2-10) azure, (17,15-16) azure. Okay.\n    - Row 18: (18,2-11) green?? (18,15-17) green?? Expected yellow/azure split. No match.\n    - Row 19: (19,2-11) azure, (19,15-17) azure. Okay.\n    - Row 20: (20,7-9) azure. Okay. Wait, output (20, 11-14) yellow. Where did this come from? Input (20,7-9).\n8. Coords: (22,2)-(22,4) - Size 3. BBox=(22,22,2,4). Overlaps cols 11-14? No. Output: (22,2-4) azure. No match (expected green).\n9. Coords: (23,1)-(23,5), (24,2)-(24,6), (24,11-17), (25,4)-(25,5), (25,8)-(25,17), (26,9)-(26,11) - BBox=(23,26,1,17). Overlaps cols 11-14? Yes.\n    Output check:\n    - Row 23: (23,1-5) azure. Okay.\n    - Row 24: (24,2-6) green. (24,11-17) green. No match.\n    - Row 25: (25,4-5) azure, (25,8-10) azure, (25,11) azure, (25,12-17) green? Expected yellow/azure. No match.\n    - Row 26: (26,9-10) azure, (26,11) yellow, (26,12-14) yellow? Input (26,9-11). Output (26,9-10) azure, (26,11-14) yellow. Partial match on (26,11).\n\nThis is much more complex. The rules are not simply \"overlap column -> split yellow/azure\" and \"no overlap -> green\".\n\nLet's revisit the output green shapes:\n- (0, 11-14): Size 4. Seems related to input obj 1 (1, 11-12)? Moved up and expanded?\n- (6, 4-6): Size 3. Matches input obj 3 (6, 4-6). Changed color.\n- (6, 11-14): Size 4. Input has nothing here.\n- (12, 9-17): Size 9. Input obj 6 part? (12, 9-17). Changed color.\n- (18, 2-17): Size 16. Input obj 7 part? (18, 2-11), (18, 15-17). Changed color and filled gap.\n- (24, 2-6): Size 5. Input obj 9 part? (24, 2-6). Changed color.\n- (24, 11-17): Size 7. Input obj 9 part? (24, 11-17). Changed color.\n- (25, 12-17): Size 6. Input obj 9 part? (25, 12-17). Changed color.\n\nLet's revisit the output yellow shapes:\n- (2, 11-14): Size 4. Input obj 2 part (2, 11-14).\n- (4, 11-14): Size 4. Input obj 2 part (4, 13-14), expanded to cols 11-14?\n- (8, 11-14): Size 4. Input obj 4 part (8, 11-14).\n- (10, 11-14): Size 4. Input obj 4 part (10,?) No azure in input (10, 11-14).\n- (14, 11-14): Size 4. Input obj 6 part (14, 13-14), expanded?\n- (16, 11-14): Size 4. Input obj 7 part? No azure in input (16, 11-14).\n- (20, 11-14): Size 4. Input obj 7 part? No azure in input (20, 11-14).\n- (22, 11-14): Size 4. Input obj 8 part? No azure in input (22, 11-14).\n- (26, 11-14): Size 4. Input obj 9 part (26, 11), expanded?\n- (28, 11-14): Size 4. The original input yellow key object.\n\nThis suggests a pattern:\n1.  Identify the unique yellow (4) object (key). Find its column span [C_min, C_max].\n2.  Create the output grid, initially empty or background color (blue 1).\n3.  Copy the key object to the output.\n4.  Identify all azure (8) objects.\n5.  For each azure object:\n    a. Find the set of rows (R_set) occupied by the object.\n    b. Check if *any* part of the object falls within the key columns [C_min, C_max].\n    c. If YES (overlap):\n        i. For each row `r` in R_set, paint yellow (4) in the output grid from `(r, C_min)` to `(r, C_max)`.\n        ii. Keep the parts of the original azure object that are *outside* the key columns [C_min, C_max] as azure (8) in the output.\n    d. If NO (no overlap): Change the *entire* azure object to green (3) in the output.\n\nLet's try this new hypothesis on train_1:\n- Key: Yellow (4) at (28, 11-14). Column range: C_min=11, C_max=14.\n- Output grid initialized to blue (1). Add key (28, 11-14) = yellow (4).\n- Azure Objects (manual grouping again):\n    1. (1,11-12): Rows={1}. Overlaps cols 11-14? Yes.\n       - Output: Paint yellow (4) at (1, 11-14). Keep azure outside cols 11-14 (none).\n       - Actual Output: Blue (1) at row 1. Green (3) at (0, 11-14)? Hypothesis failed.\n    2. (2,7-17), (3,8-17), (4,13-16): Rows={2,3,4}. Overlaps cols 11-14? Yes.\n       - Output: Paint yellow (4) at (2, 11-14), (3, 11-14), (4, 11-14). Keep azure outside: (2,7-10), (2,15-17), (3,8-10), (3,15-17), (4,15-16).\n       - Actual Output: Yellow at (2, 11-14), (4, 11-14). Azure at (2,7-10), (2,15-17), (3,8-10), (3,15-17), (4,15-16). Blue at (3, 11-14). Close, but row 3 is wrong.\n    3. (6,4-6): Rows={6}. Overlaps cols 11-14? No.\n       - Output: Paint green (3) at (6, 4-6).\n       - Actual Output: Green at (6, 4-6). Matches!\n    4. (7,4-10), (8,3-17), (9,2-10), (10,3-7): Rows={7,8,9,10}. Overlaps cols 11-14? Yes (row 8).\n       - Output: Paint yellow (4) at (7,11-14), (8,11-14), (9,11-14), (10,11-14). Keep azure outside: (7,4-10), (8,3-10), (8,15-17), (9,2-10), (10,3-7).\n       - Actual Output: Yellow at (8, 11-14), (10, 11-14). Azure at (7,4-10), (8,3-10), (8,15-17), (9,2-10), (10,3-7). Missing yellow on rows 7, 9.\n    5. (11,15-16): Rows={11}. Overlaps cols 11-14? No.\n       - Output: Paint green (3) at (11, 15-16).\n       - Actual Output: Azure at (11, 15-16). No match.\n    6. (12,9-17), (13,9-17), (14,13-16): Rows={12,13,14}. Overlaps cols 11-14? Yes.\n       - Output: Paint yellow (4) at (12,11-14), (13,11-14), (14,11-14). Keep azure outside: (12,9-10), (12,15-17), (13,9-10), (13,15-17), (14,15-16).\n       - Actual Output: Green at (12,9-17)? Azure at (13,9-10), (13,15-17). Blue at (13,11-14). Yellow at (14,11-14). Azure at (14,15-16). Very inconsistent.\n    ... this hypothesis is also flawed.\n\nLet's look at the relationship between the input yellow and the output colors differently.\n- Input yellow object Y_in at (28, 11-14).\n- Consider an azure pixel P_az at (r, c) in the input.\n- If P_az shares the same column `c` with *any* pixel of Y_in (i.e., `c` is in [11, 14]), does P_az turn yellow in the output?\n    - Test: Input (1, 11) is azure. Output (1, 11) is blue. No.\n    - Test: Input (2, 11) is azure. Output (2, 11) is yellow. Yes.\n    - Test: Input (3, 11) is azure. Output (3, 11) is blue. No.\n    - Test: Input (4, 13) is azure. Output (4, 13) is yellow. Yes.\n    - Test: Input (8, 11) is azure. Output (8, 11) is yellow. Yes.\n- If P_az shares the same row `r` with *any* pixel of Y_in (i.e., `r` is 28)? No azure pixels in row 28.\n- If P_az belongs to an azure object that has *any* pixel sharing a column with Y_in, does P_az turn yellow? No, we saw some turn azure or blue.\n- If P_az belongs to an azure object that has *no* pixel sharing a column with Y_in, does P_az turn green?\n    - Test: Object (6, 4-6). No column overlap. Output is green. Yes.\n    - Test: Object (11, 15-16). No column overlap. Output is azure. No.\n\nMaybe it depends on the *shape* of the yellow key? It's a 1x4 horizontal line.\nWhat if the key was a vertical line? Or a different shape? Example 2 might help.\n\n**Input Analysis (train_2):**\n- Background: Azure (8).\n- Objects: Red (2) blobs, one Yellow (4) shape (3x1 vertical line).\n- Yellow key: (28, 2)-(28, 4). Wait, this is input grid. Let me read carefully.\n- Input Yellow key: Rows 28, 29, 30? No, last row is row 28.\n- Input: Grid size 29x22. Background azure (8). Red (2) shapes. Yellow (4) shape at (28, 2-4). It's a 1x3 horizontal line.\n- Key: (28, 2-4). Column range [2, 4].\n\n**Output Analysis (train_2):**\n- Background: Azure (8).\n- Some input Red (2) shapes remain Red (2).\n- Some input Red (2) shapes become Green (3).\n- Some input Red (2) shapes become Yellow (4).\n- Let's apply the \"column overlap\" hypothesis:\n    - Key columns: [2, 4].\n    - Iterate through Red (2) objects in the input.\n    - If a Red object overlaps columns 2-4: pixels within cols 2-4 turn yellow (4), pixels outside cols 2-4 remain red (2).\n    - If a Red object does NOT overlap columns 2-4: the entire object turns green (3).\n\nLet's test this on train_2:\n- Key: Yellow (4) at (28, 2-4). Columns [2, 4].\n- Red Objects (visual inspection):\n    1. (2,4-6), (3,4-10), (4,6-9), (5,5-9), (6,2-11), (7,6-12), (8,6-12), (9,6-8), (9,11-12) - BBox=(2,9,2,12). Overlaps cols 2-4? Yes (rows 3, 6).\n        - Rule: Pixels in cols 2-4 turn yellow (4). Others remain red (2).\n        - Input pixels in cols 2-4: (3,4), (6,2-4).\n        - Expected output: (3,4)=yellow, (6,2-4)=yellow. Rest red.\n        - Actual Output:\n            - Row 2: (2,4-6) red -> Output (2,4-6)? No, output (2,4)=yellow, (2,5-6)=red. Why (2,4) yellow?\n            - Row 3: (3,4-10) red -> Output (3,4)=yellow, (3,5-10)=red. Matches expectation for (3,4).\n            - Row 4: (4,6-9) red -> Output (4,6-9)? No, output (4,4)=yellow, (4,6-9)=red. Why (4,4) yellow?\n            - Row 5: (5,5-9) red -> Output (5,5-9)=red. Matches expectation (no overlap).\n            - Row 6: (6,2-11) red -> Output (6,2-4)=green??, (6,5-11)=red. Expected (6,2-4)=yellow. No match.\n            - Row 7: (7,6-12) red -> Output (7,6-12)=red? No, output (7,2-4)=green?? No red in row 7 output.\n            - Row 8: (8,6-12) red -> Output (8,6-12)=red? No, output (8,2-4)=yellow?? No red in row 8 output.\n            - Row 9: (9,6-8), (9,11-12) red -> Output (9,6-8), (9,11-12)=red? No, output has no red in row 9.\n        - This hypothesis is failing badly. The output yellow/green shapes seem to be placed based on the *row* of the input red object and the *column* of the input yellow key.\n\nLet's try again:\nHypothesis 2: Paint By Location\n1. Find the unique yellow object (key). Get its bounding box (Rk_min, Rk_max, Ck_min, Ck_max).\n2. Find all other non-background objects (targets). In ex1, target is azure(8). In ex2, target is red(2).\n3. Create the output grid, copy background and key object.\n4. For each target object:\n    a. Find its bounding box (Rt_min, Rt_max, Ct_min, Ct_max).\n    b. Check if the target object's bounding box *intersects* the key's bounding box? No, that's not general enough.\n    c. Check if the target object's column range [Ct_min, Ct_max] overlaps with the key's column range [Ck_min, Ck_max].\n    d. If YES (column overlap): For each row `r` from Rt_min to Rt_max, paint Yellow (4) in the output grid from `(r, Ck_min)` to `(r, Ck_max)`. Keep the original target object pixels that are *outside* the key's columns [Ck_min, Ck_max] with their original color.\n    e. If NO (no column overlap): For each row `r` from Rt_min to Rt_max, paint Green (3) in the output grid from `(r, Ck_min)` to `(r, Ck_max)`. Keep the original target object pixels (which are all outside the key's columns) with their original color.\n\nLet's re-test Hypothesis 2 on train_1:\n- Key: Yellow (4) at (28, 11-14). BBox=(28, 28, 11, 14). [Ck_min, Ck_max] = [11, 14].\n- Target: Azure (8).\n- Output grid initialized to blue (1). Add key (28, 11-14) = yellow (4).\n- Azure Objects (manual grouping):\n    1. (1,11-12): BBox=(1,1,11,12). Rows={1}. Col range [11,12]. Overlaps [11,14]? Yes.\n       - Rule: Paint Yellow (4) at (1, 11-14). Keep original azure pixels outside [11,14] (none).\n       - Actual Output: Blue at row 1. Green at (0, 11-14)? No match.\n    2. (2,7-17), (3,8-17), (4,13-16): BBox=(2,4,7,17). Rows={2,3,4}. Col range [7,17]. Overlaps [11,14]? Yes.\n       - Rule: Paint Yellow (4) at (2, 11-14), (3, 11-14), (4, 11-14). Keep azure outside [11,14]: (2,7-10), (2,15-17), (3,8-10), (3,15-17), (4,15-16).\n       - Actual Output: Yellow at (2, 11-14), (4, 11-14). Azure at (2,7-10), (2,15-17), (3,8-10), (3,15-17), (4,15-16). Blue at (3, 11-14). Closer, but row 3 painted blue, not yellow. And row 3 kept azure correctly.\n    3. (6,4-6): BBox=(6,6,4,6). Rows={6}. Col range [4,6]. Overlaps [11,14]? No.\n       - Rule: Paint Green (3) at (6, 11-14). Keep original azure pixels (6, 4-6) as azure.\n       - Actual Output: Green at (6, 4-6). Azure elsewhere. No match. Output green replaces original object.\n    4. (7,4-10), (8,3-17), (9,2-10), (10,3-7): BBox=(7,10,2,17). Rows={7,8,9,10}. Col range [2,17]. Overlaps [11,14]? Yes.\n       - Rule: Paint Yellow (4) at (7,11-14), (8,11-14), (9,11-14), (10,11-14). Keep azure outside [11,14]: (7,4-10), (8,3-10), (8,15-17), (9,2-10), (10,3-7).\n       - Actual Output: Yellow at (8, 11-14), (10, 11-14). Azure at (7,4-10), (8,3-10), (8,15-17), (9,2-10), (10,3-7). Matches azure keeping. Partially matches yellow painting (rows 8, 10 yes; rows 7, 9 no).\n\nThis hypothesis is also wrong. The painting location (key columns) and color (yellow/green) seems right, but *which* rows get painted, and what happens to the original object pixels is still unclear.\n\nMaybe it's simpler. Find the key object (yellow). Find its column span C. Find all other objects (azure/red). For each other object O:\n- Get its row span R.\n- Does O overlap columns C?\n    - Yes -> For each row r in R, paint Yellow in columns C.\n    - No -> For each row r in R, paint Green in columns C.\n- Keep the original pixels of O unchanged if they are outside columns C. Erase them if they are inside columns C?\n\nLet's try Hypothesis 3 on train_1:\n- Key: Yellow (4) at (28, 11-14). Columns C=[11, 14].\n- Output grid initialized as input.\n- Azure Objects:\n    1. (1,11-12): Rows R={1}. Overlaps C? Yes.\n       - Rule: Paint Yellow (4) at (1, 11-14). Erase original (1, 11-12)?\n       - Actual Output: Blue at row 1. Green at (0, 11-14)? No match.\n    2. (2,7-17), (3,8-17), (4,13-16): Rows R={2,3,4}. Overlaps C? Yes.\n       - Rule: Paint Yellow (4) at (2, 11-14), (3, 11-14), (4, 11-14). Erase originals inside C: (2,11-14), (3,11-14), (4,13-14). Keep originals outside C: (2,7-10), (2,15-17), (3,8-10), (3,15-17), (4,15-16).\n       - Actual Output: Yellow at (2, 11-14), (4, 11-14). Blue at (3, 11-14). Azure kept correctly outside C. Close, but row 3 painted blue/erased, not yellow.\n    3. (6,4-6): Rows R={6}. Overlaps C? No.\n       - Rule: Paint Green (3) at (6, 11-14). Keep original (6, 4-6) as azure.\n       - Actual Output: Green at (6, 4-6). Azure elsewhere. No match.\n    4. (7,4-10), (8,3-17), (9,2-10), (10,3-7): Rows R={7,8,9,10}. Overlaps C? Yes.\n       - Rule: Paint Yellow (4) at (7,11-14), (8,11-14), (9,11-14), (10,11-14). Erase originals inside C: (8,11-14). Keep originals outside C: (7,4-10), (8,3-10), (8,15-17), (9,2-10), (10,3-7).\n       - Actual Output: Yellow at (8, 11-14), (10, 11-14). Azure kept correctly outside C. Matches azure keeping. Partially matches yellow painting (rows 8, 10 yes; rows 7, 9 no). Erasing seems okay for row 8.\n\nIt seems the rule is:\n1. Identify the \"key\" object (color 4 - yellow). Determine its column span (min_col, max_col).\n2. Identify all \"target\" objects (color 8 - azure in ex1, color 2 - red in ex2).\n3. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n4. For each target object:\n    a. Determine its row span (min_row, max_row).\n    b. Check if the target object has *any* pixel whose column falls within the key's column span [min_col, max_col].\n    c. If YES (overlap):\n        i. Determine the color to paint: Yellow (4).\n    d. If NO (no overlap):\n        i. Determine the color to paint: Green (3).\n    e. For each row `r` from min_row to max_row:\n        i. For each column `c` from min_col to max_col:\n           Set output grid cell (r, c) to the determined paint color (Yellow or Green).\n\nLet's try Hypothesis 4 on train_1:\n- Key: Yellow (4) at (28, 11-14). Columns [11, 14].\n- Output initialized as input.\n- Target Objects (Azure, 8):\n    1. Obj covering rows 1-4. Overlaps cols [11,14]? Yes. Paint color = Yellow (4).\n       - Rule: For r=1 to 4, set output(r, 11..14) = Yellow (4).\n       - Actual Output: (1, 11-14)=Blue. (2, 11-14)=Yellow. (3, 11-14)=Blue. (4, 11-14)=Yellow. Inconsistent.\n    2. Obj at (6, 4-6). Rows={6}. Overlaps cols [11,14]? No. Paint color = Green (3).\n       - Rule: For r=6, set output(6, 11..14) = Green (3).\n       - Actual Output: (6, 4-6)=Green. (6, 11-14)=Green. Matches the painting part! But original object seems erased.\n    3. Obj covering rows 7-10. Rows={7,8,9,10}. Overlaps cols [11,14]? Yes. Paint color = Yellow (4).\n       - Rule: For r=7 to 10, set output(r, 11..14) = Yellow (4).\n       - Actual Output: (7, 11-14)=Blue. (8, 11-14)=Yellow. (9, 11-14)=Blue. (10, 11-14)=Yellow. Inconsistent.\n    4. Obj at (11, 15-16). Rows={11}. Overlaps cols [11,14]? No. Paint color = Green (3).\n       - Rule: For r=11, set output(11, 11..14) = Green (3).\n       - Actual Output: (11, 11-14)=Blue. (11, 15-16)=Azure. No match.\n    5. Obj covering rows 12-14. Rows={12,13,14}. Overlaps cols [11,14]? Yes. Paint color = Yellow (4).\n       - Rule: For r=12 to 14, set output(r, 11..14) = Yellow (4).\n       - Actual Output: (12, 11-14)=Green?. (13, 11-14)=Blue. (14, 11-14)=Yellow. Inconsistent.\n    6. Obj covering rows 16-20. Rows={16,17,18,19,20}. Overlaps cols [11,14]? Yes. Paint color = Yellow (4).\n       - Rule: For r=16 to 20"
