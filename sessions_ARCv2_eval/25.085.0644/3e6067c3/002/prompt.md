Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the color priority legend: Find the row near the bottom containing pairs of azure (8) and another color (C), forming a sequence like 8, C1, 8, C2, ... Extract the ordered list of colors [C1, C2, ...]. Colors appearing earlier have higher priority.
2. Find all box objects: Locate rectangular structures made of a blue (1) border completely surrounding a solid inner region of a single color (not blue or azure). Record the inner color and the coordinates (bounding box) of the blue border for each box.
3. Identify adjacent boxes and gaps: Find pairs of boxes whose blue borders are separated by exactly one row or one column consisting entirely of azure (8) pixels. These azure pixels form the 'gap'.
4. Fill gaps based on priority: For each identified gap between two adjacent boxes (Box A with inner color CA, Box B with inner color CB):
    a. Determine which color (CA or CB) has higher priority based on the legend list.
    b. Change the color of all azure pixels in the gap to the higher priority color.
5. Return the modified grid.
