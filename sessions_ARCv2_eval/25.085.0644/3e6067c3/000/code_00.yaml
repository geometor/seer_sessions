task_description: Fill the azure gaps between adjacent blue-bordered boxes based on a color priority defined by a legend row.

grid_properties:
  background_color: 8 # azure

objects:
  - type: box
    description: Rectangular structures with a border and an inner color.
    properties:
      border_color: 1 # blue
      inner_color: Any color other than 1 (blue) or 8 (azure).
      shape: Rectangular border enclosing a solid inner color area.
      location: Various positions within the grid.
  - type: legend
    description: A row defining the priority order of colors found inside boxes.
    properties:
      structure: Sequence of pairs (8, C), where C is a color.
      location: Typically near the bottom of the grid.
      role: Defines color precedence for the fill action.
  - type: gap
    description: Azure pixels separating adjacent boxes.
    properties:
      color: 8 # azure (initially)
      location: Between the blue borders of two adjacent boxes.
      shape: A single row or column strip.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Two boxes are adjacent if their blue borders are separated only by a single row or column of azure pixels.
    applies_to: [box, box]
    produces: gap coordinates

actions:
  - name: identify_boxes_and_legend
    description: Locate all blue-bordered boxes, extract their inner colors, and parse the legend row to establish color order.
  - name: find_adjacent_pairs
    description: Identify all pairs of boxes that are adjacent horizontally or vertically.
  - name: determine_fill_color
    description: For an adjacent pair, compare their inner colors based on the legend order. Select the color that appears earlier in the legend.
  - name: fill_gap
    description: Change the color of the azure pixels in the gap between an adjacent pair to the determined fill color.
    target: gap pixels
    color_source: result of determine_fill_color

transformation_logic:
  - step: Parse the legend row to get the color priority list.
  - step: Identify all box objects (border, inner color, coordinates).
  - step: Find all pairs of boxes that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically).
  - step: For each adjacent pair:
      - Identify the azure pixels forming the gap between them.
      - Determine the inner colors (C1, C2) of the pair.
      - Find which color (C1 or C2) has higher priority based on the legend.
      - Recolor the gap pixels with the higher priority color.
