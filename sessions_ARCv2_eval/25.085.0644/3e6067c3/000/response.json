            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Background:** The grids predominantly use azure (8) as the background color.\n2.  **Box Structures:** There are distinct rectangular objects made with a border of blue (1) pixels. These boxes enclose a smaller area filled with a single, non-blue, non-azure color. The size of the boxes and the enclosed colored area can vary between examples (e.g., 4x4 blue border with 2x2 inner color in train_1, 3x3 blue border with 1x1 inner color in train_2, 5x5 blue border with 1x1 inner color in train_3).\n3.  **Legend/Key:** Near the bottom of each input grid, there's a row containing pairs of `azure (8) color (C)`. This row seems to act as a key or define an ordering for the colors found inside the boxes.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of some azure (8) pixels located *between* adjacent box structures.\n5.  **Color Determination:** The color used to fill the gap between two adjacent boxes is determined by the inner colors of those two boxes, specifically the one whose color appears *earlier* in the legend row.\n6.  **Gap Location:** The pixels that change color are precisely the azure (8) pixels situated directly between the blue (1) borders of two adjacent boxes. If boxes are adjacent horizontally, the gap is a vertical strip of azure pixels. If boxes are adjacent vertically, the gap is a horizontal strip of azure pixels. The thickness of this strip is always one pixel.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Extract the sequence of colors `C` in the order they appear; this is the color priority list (earlier colors have higher priority).\n3.  **Identify Boxes:** Find all objects consisting of a solid-colored inner region completely surrounded by a border of blue (1) pixels. For each box, record its inner color and the coordinates of its blue (1) border pixels.\n4.  **Find Adjacencies and Gaps:**\n    *   Iterate through all unique pairs of identified boxes.\n    *   For each pair (Box A, Box B), check for adjacency:\n        *   **Horizontal Adjacency:** Check if the rightmost blue border column of Box A is immediately to the left of the leftmost blue border column of Box B, *and* they share overlapping row indices, *and* the columns between them contain only azure (8) pixels. If true, record the coordinates of these intermediate azure pixels as the \"gap\".\n        *   **Vertical Adjacency:** Check if the bottommost blue border row of Box A is immediately above the topmost blue border row of Box B, *and* they share overlapping column indices, *and* the rows between them contain only azure (8) pixels. If true, record the coordinates of these intermediate azure pixels as the \"gap\".\n5.  **Apply Fill Rule:** For every identified adjacent pair (Box A, Box B) with an associated \"gap\":\n    *   Get the inner color of Box A (Color A) and Box B (Color B).\n    *   Compare the positions of Color A and Color B in the color priority list derived from the legend.\n    *   Select the color that appears earlier in the list as the \"fill color\".\n    *   Modify the output grid by changing the color of all pixels within the identified \"gap\" coordinates to the determined \"fill color\".\n6.  **Return Output:** The final modified grid is the result."
