Locate the first row that follows the pattern `azure, color1, azure, color2, azure, color3, ...` across its width (allowing for trailing azure pixels). Extract the sequence of non-azure colors (`color1, color2, color3, ...`). This sequence defines the color priority, where colors appearing earlier have higher priority. If no such legend is found, assume a default low priority for all colors.\n2. Find Blue-Bordered Boxes: Search the grid for distinct rectangular objects. A valid object consists of a continuous, single-pixel-thick border of blue (1) pixels completely enclosing a rectangular area. The enclosed area must be filled entirely with a single color, which cannot be blue (1) or azure (8). Record the inner color and the bounding box coordinates (of the blue border) for each valid box found.\n3. Identify Adjacent Boxes and Azure Gaps: Examine all pairs of identified boxes. If two boxes are adjacent either horizontally or vertically, and the space between their blue borders consists *only* of a single row or single column composed entirely of azure (8) pixels, identify this sequence of azure pixels as a 'gap'. The adjacency must be exact (separation distance of 1 pixel, filled with azure).\n4. Determine Fill Color: For each identified gap, consider the inner colors of the two boxes adjacent to it. Compare their priorities based on the legend identified in step 1. The color with the higher priority (appearing earlier in the legend sequence) is the designated 'fill color' for this gap. If priorities are equal (e.g., same color or neither in legend), the color of the first box considered (e.g., Box A in an A-B pair) is used due to the `<=` check.\n5. Fill Gaps: Create a copy of the input grid. For every identified gap, change the color of all azure (8) pixels within that gap to the fill color determined in step 4.\n6. Output: Return the modified grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef _find_legend_priority(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds the legend row and returns a dictionary mapping color to priority (lower is better).\"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    legend_priority = {}\n    priority_list = []\n\n    # Scan rows from bottom up, looking for the pattern 8, C, 8, C...\n    for r in range(height -
