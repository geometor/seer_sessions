            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the examples provided.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are grids of pixels (colors represented by numbers 0-9). The grids are 30x30 in all examples.\n2.  **Background Color:** Each grid has a dominant background color (Orange 7 in Ex1, Blue 1 in Ex2, Magenta 6 in Ex3). This background color remains unchanged in the output.\n3.  **Objects:** There are distinct objects placed on the background. These objects appear in two primary shapes:\n    *   **Plus Signs:** A 3x3 shape where the center pixel and its four orthogonal neighbors share the same color, distinct from the background. Example: a 3x3 area with corners matching the background and the rest being the object's color.\n    *   **Horizontal Lines:** A 1x5 line of a single color located specifically at the bottom-most row (row index 29 in these 30x30 grids).\n4.  **Object Colors:** The plus signs and horizontal lines can have various colors, different from the background.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core task involves changing the colors of certain objects based on their shape and original color, while removing others entirely.\n    *   The horizontal lines at the very bottom are consistently removed (replaced with the background color).\n    *   The plus-sign objects either retain their color or change to Gray (5). The change depends on the original color: Maroon (9), Magenta (6), and Green (3) become Gray (5). All other colors (White 0, Blue 1, Red 2, Yellow 4, Orange 7, Azure 8) remain unchanged.\n    *   The positions of the plus signs that are not removed remain the same.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Check if the object is a 1x5 horizontal line located entirely within the bottom-most row of the grid (row index equals grid height minus 1).\n    c.  If it is such a bottom-row horizontal line, iterate through all its pixels in the output grid copy and change their color to the identified background color.\n    d.  If the object is *not* a bottom-row horizontal line, check if it matches the 3x3 plus-sign shape (a 3x3 bounding box where the center and its 4 orthogonal neighbors have the object's color, and the 4 corner pixels match the background color *or* are outside the object's contiguous area).\n    e.  If it is a plus-sign object, examine its original color:\n        i.  If the original color is Maroon (9), Magenta (6), or Green (3), iterate through the 5 pixels forming the plus sign in the output grid copy and change their color to Gray (5).\n        ii. If the original color is anything else, leave the object's pixels unchanged in the output grid copy (they already have the correct color from the initial copy).\n5.
