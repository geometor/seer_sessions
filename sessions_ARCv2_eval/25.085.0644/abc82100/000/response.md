*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The task involves transforming an input grid of colored pixels into an output grid of the same dimensions.
    *   The transformation rule depends entirely on the set of colors present in the input grid.
    *   Four distinct transformation scenarios are observed across the examples, prioritized in a specific order.
    *   Common operations include color swapping between paired colors (Blue/Red, Red/Yellow, Magenta/Orange), color conversion (sometimes conditional on position, e.g., Yellow/Azure to Red, Blue/Azure to Orange), and geometric transformation (horizontal flip).
    *   The color Azure (8) is frequently present in inputs but is either ignored or acts as a source for color conversion in specific rules; it never appears directly in the output unless it was part of a swap (which isn't observed for Azure).
    *   Pixels of colors not involved in the triggered rule for a given input are effectively removed (become white/0 in the output).
