            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided Python code attempts to implement a multi-stage transformation: yellow horizontal connection followed by simultaneous source expansion (BFS). However, the code fails on all three training examples, producing outputs with significantly more filled pixels than expected.\n\nThe core issue appears to be in the **BFS expansion phase (Step 4)**. The current implementation allows sources to expand into any cell that was *originally* white, even if that cell became non-white (e.g., yellow) during the connection phase or if it should logically be blocked by adjacent non-white cells from the initial state. The expected outputs show much more constrained expansion, suggesting that *all* non-white cells present after the yellow connection phase should act as barriers to the BFS expansion.\n\nThe color transformation rules (Azure->Blue if Magenta source exists, Magenta->Orange if any Orange exists) appear consistent across the examples. The yellow connection rule also seems correctly applied in Example 1, though it wasn't applicable or didn't change the grid in Examples 2 and 3 based on the specific inputs.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the BFS expansion logic to properly respect barriers defined by *all* non-white cells in the grid state *after* the yellow connection phase.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's gather metrics for each example.\n\n"
