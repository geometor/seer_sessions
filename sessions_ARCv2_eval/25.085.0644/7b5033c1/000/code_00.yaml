elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - shape (rows x columns)
      - pixels (color values 0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color (value 0-9)
      - position (row, column)
  - type: background_pixel
    description: The most frequent pixel color in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color
  - type: foreground_pixel
    description: Any pixel whose color is different from the background color.
    properties:
      - color
      - position (row, column)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid structure.
  - type: ordering
    description: Pixels can be ordered based on their position using a raster scan (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).

actions:
  - name: identify_background_color
    input: input_grid
    output: background_color
    description: Determine the color value that appears most frequently in the input grid.
  - name: scan_grid
    input: input_grid
    output: sequence_of_pixels
    description: Iterate through the pixels of the input grid in raster scan order.
  - name: filter_foreground_pixels
    input: sequence_of_pixels, background_color
    output: sequence_of_foreground_pixels
    description: Select only those pixels from the input sequence whose color is not the background color.
  - name: extract_colors
    input: sequence_of_foreground_pixels
    output: sequence_of_colors
    description: Create a sequence containing only the color values from the sequence of foreground pixels, maintaining the order.
  - name: construct_output_grid
    input: sequence_of_colors
    output: output_grid
    description: Create a grid with one column and height equal to the length of the color sequence, populating the column with the colors from the sequence.

transformation_goal:
  - Create a single-column grid containing the colors of all non-background pixels from the input grid, ordered according to a raster scan of the input.
