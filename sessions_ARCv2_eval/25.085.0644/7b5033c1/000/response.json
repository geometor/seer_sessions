The output is always a 1D grid (a single column) of pixels.\n2.  **Background Color:** Each input grid appears to have a dominant \"background\" color (azure/8 in train\\_1, blue/1 in train\\_2).\n3.  **Foreground Pixels:** There are other pixels scattered within the grid, distinct from the background color. These seem to be the focus of the transformation.\n4.  **Transformation:** The output column seems to list the colors of all the non-background pixels from the input grid.\n5.  **Ordering:** The order of colors in the output column corresponds precisely to the order in which the non-background pixels are encountered when scanning the input grid row by row, from top to bottom, and within each row, from left to right (raster scan order).\n6.  **Output Dimensions:** The height of the output column is equal to the total number of non-background pixels in the input grid. The width is always 1.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
