Some shapes appear to fully enclose regions of white pixels.\n4.  **Unique Color:** In each input grid, there appears to be exactly one pixel of a specific color (orange (7) in train_1, yellow (4) in train_2, train_3, train_4). This unique color seems significant.\n5.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation involves changing the color of *some* white (0) pixels to the unique color identified in the input. The pixels being changed are those located *inside* closed boundaries formed by non-white pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Store this color as the `fill_color`.\n3.  **Identify Enclosed White Pixels:**\n    a. Create a boolean grid of the same dimensions as the input, initially all `False`. This grid will mark white pixels reachable from the border.\n    b. Initialize a queue with the coordinates of all white (0) pixels located on the border (first/last row or first/last column) of the input grid. Mark these positions as `True` in the boolean grid.\n    c. While the queue is not empty:\n        i. Dequeue a coordinate `(r, c)`.\n        ii. For each orthogonal neighbor `(nr, nc)` (up, down, left, right) of `(r, c)`:\n            - If the neighbor is within the grid bounds, is white (0) in the input grid, and is marked `False` in the boolean grid:\n                - Mark `(nr, nc)` as `True` in the boolean grid.\n                - Enqueue `(nr, nc)`.\n4.  **Apply Fill:** Iterate through every pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid. If the pixel is white (0) and its corresponding position `(r, c)` in the boolean grid is `False` (meaning it was not reachable from the border), change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to the `fill_color`.\n5.  **Return:** The modified output grid."
