"""
Identifies the background color as the most frequent color in the input grid.
Finds all contiguous objects composed of non-background colors.
Determines the largest object based on the number of pixels; this is designated as the 'frame'.
Calculates the bounding box of this frame object.
Creates an output grid with the dimensions of the frame's bounding box.
Initializes the output grid entirely with the frame's color.
Iterates through the corresponding area in the input grid (defined by the bounding box).
For each position within the bounding box:
  - If the pixel in the input grid is NOT the background color AND it is NOT part of the frame object itself, its color is copied to the corresponding pixel in the output grid.
  - Otherwise, the output grid pixel retains the frame's color.
Returns the resulting output grid.
