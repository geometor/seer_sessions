task_description: "Transform azure pixels based on adjacency to blue or magenta pixels."
elements:
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
        role: background, potentially changing
      - color: blue (1)
        role: trigger, static
      - color: magenta (6)
        role: trigger, static
      - color: orange (7)
        role: result, new
      - position: (row, col)
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    definition: "A pixel at (r1, c1) is adjacent to a pixel at (r2, c2) if max(abs(r1-r2), abs(c1-c2)) == 1."
    applies_to:
      - pixel (azure)
      - pixel (blue)
      - pixel (magenta)
actions:
  - action: change_color
    actor: pixel (azure)
    condition: "Is adjacent to at least one pixel (blue) or the pixel (magenta)."
    result: "Pixel color becomes orange (7)."
  - action: retain_color
    actor: pixel
    condition: "Pixel is blue (1) or magenta (6), OR pixel is azure (8) and is NOT adjacent to any blue (1) or magenta (6) pixel."
    result: "Pixel color remains unchanged."
grid_properties:
  - size: Variable height and width between examples.
  - preservation: Grid dimensions remain the same between input and output.
