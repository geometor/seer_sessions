Grid:
  - Input grid contains pixels of various colors, primarily azure (8), blue (1), and magenta (6).
  - Output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
Pixels:
  - Blue (1) pixels in the input remain blue (1) in the output.
  - Magenta (6) pixels in the input remain magenta (6) in the output.
  - Azure (8) pixels in the input either remain azure (8) or change to orange (7) in the output.
  - No other color changes occur.
Objects:
  - Blue (1) and Magenta (6) pixels act as fixed barriers or walls.
  - Azure (8) pixels form contiguous regions.
Relationships:
  - Connectivity: Azure pixels are considered connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically.
  - Containment: Some regions of azure pixels are enclosed by the barriers (blue/magenta pixels) and the grid boundaries.
  - Accessibility: Some regions of azure pixels are connected to the grid boundary (top, bottom, left, or right edge) without crossing a barrier pixel.
Actions:
  - Identify all azure (8) pixels connected to any border cell (top, bottom, left, right edge) through a path of only azure pixels. These paths cannot cross blue (1) or magenta (6) pixels.
  - All azure (8) pixels identified as connected to the border remain azure (8).
  - All other azure (8) pixels (those not connected to the border, i.e., enclosed) are changed to orange (7).
