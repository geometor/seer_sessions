            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe primary issue is the `ImportError: No module named 'scipy'`, which prevented the code from running and validating the transformation logic. The proposed logic in the previous code involved identifying connected non-background objects (using `scipy.ndimage.label`) and simulating gravity, where each object falls vertically until it hits the grid bottom or another settled object.\n\nThe strategy is:\n1.  Analyze all provided training examples to confirm if the \"gravity\" hypothesis holds true.\n2.  Identify the background color and the colors of the objects that move.\n3.  Determine the rules for object identification (connectivity - 4-way or 8-way?).\n4.  Refine the description of how objects move and settle.\n5.  Update the natural language program to accurately reflect the observed transformation across *all* examples.\n6.  Consider alternatives to `scipy.ndimage.label` for finding connected components, like implementing a BFS or DFS algorithm, to avoid dependency issues.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nTo understand the transformation, let's analyze the properties of the input and output grids for each training example.\n\n"

My gravity check code had a flaw: it checked stability based *only* on the final `output_grid`. The simulation needs to place objects one by one. The Blue object is already 'settled' (it doesn't move), so the Black object falls until it hits the Blue object.\n\nThe previous code's logic for simulating the fall seems correct: check potential fall positions against the *already settled objects in the output grid*. The instability reported by my check script was likely due to checking the final state without considering the order of settling. The original code correctly sorts objects and places them sequentially.\n\nThe `scipy` dependency is the main blocker. We need to replace `scipy.ndimage.label` with a custom implementation like the `find_components_bfs` used in the analysis.\n\n## YAML Facts Block\n\n"

An object is defined as a connected group of pixels (using 8-way adjacency, including diagonals) that are not the background color. For each object, record its color, its shape (relative pixel coordinates), and its initial position (e.g., the top-left corner of its bounding box).\n3.  **Determine Settling Order**: Sort the identified objects. A reasonable order is based on their initial vertical position, typically processing objects that are lower down first (e.g., sort by the bottom-most row of the object's bounding box, then by the top-most row as a tie-breaker).\n4.  **Simulate Gravity and Place Objects**: Iterate through the sorted objects:\n    a.  For the current object, determine how far down it can fall from its initial position. Start with a potential fall distance of 0.\n    b.  Repeatedly check if the object can fall one step further (increment the fall distance). To check, calculate the potential position of *every* pixel in the object if it were moved down by the *next* potential fall distance.\n    c.  The object *cannot* fall further if *any* of its pixels at the potential new position would either:\n        i.  Be at or outside the bottom boundary of the grid.\n        ii. Land on a cell in the *output grid* that is already occupied by a non-background color (i.e., part of an object that has already settled).\n    d.  If the object can fall further, increment the fall distance and repeat step 4b. If it cannot fall further, the current fall distance is its final fall distance.\n    e.  Calculate the object's final top-left position by adding the final fall distance to its initial top row coordinate (the column coordinate remains unchanged).\n    f.  Place the object onto the output grid by coloring the corresponding pixels with the object's color, based on its shape and final position.\n5.  **Finalization**: Once all objects have been processed and placed onto the output grid, return the completed output grid."
