            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the task.\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core concepts: using the background color, finding enclosed areas via flood fill, and applying color transformations within those areas. However, the results show that the transformation rules were applied too broadly. The code changed *all* non-background pixels inside *any* enclosure, whereas the expected outputs indicate that the transformation should only apply under more specific conditions.\n\nThe key insight from comparing the failed examples is that the transformation seems dependent not only on the background color and the enclosed pixel's color but also on the color of the **immediate border** surrounding the enclosed pixel(s). Pixels enclosed by borders of certain colors change, while pixels enclosed by borders of other colors do not, even if they are the same color and within an enclosed region relative to the background.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Refine the definition of \"enclosed\" pixels that are candidates for transformation. They must not only be unreachable by the background flood fill but also be directly adjacent only to non-background colors.\n2.  Identify the color of the immediate border surrounding these candidate pixels.\n3.  Update the transformation rules to include a condition based on this border color, which itself seems dependent on the background color.\n\n## Metrics and Observations (Qualitative)\n\n*   **Example 1 (BG=Azure, 8):**\n    *   Input enclosed colors: White(0), Red(2), Blue(1).\n    *   Expected changes: Only White(0) -> Gray(5) and Red(2) -> Green(3) when the immediate border is White(0). Pixels enclosed by Blue(1) or Red(2) borders remain unchanged.\n    *   Code incorrectly changed pixels enclosed by Red(2) borders and some pixels enclosed by White(0) that were part of larger structures. The refined rule suggests checking the immediate neighbors.\n\n*   **Example 2 (BG=Maroon, 9):**\n    *   Input enclosed colors: Yellow(4), Orange(7), Magenta(6).\n    *   Expected changes: Only Yellow(4) -> Gray(5) and Orange(7) -> Green(3) when the immediate border is Yellow(4). Pixels enclosed by Magenta(6) or Orange(7) borders remain unchanged.\n    *   Code incorrectly changed pixels enclosed by Magenta(6) and Orange(7) borders.\n\n*   **Example 3 (BG=Orange, 7):**\n    *   Input enclosed colors: Blue(1), Magenta(6), Red(2).\n    *   Expected changes: Only Blue(1) -> Green(3) and Magenta(6) -> Gray(5) when the immediate border is Magenta(6). Pixels enclosed by Blue(1) or Red(2) borders remain unchanged.\n    *   Code incorrectly changed pixels enclosed by Blue(1) and Red(2) borders.\n\n**Common Pattern:**\nThe transformation `(Original Color -> New Color)` happens only for pixels inside an enclosure formed by a specific `Trigger Border Color`. This `Trigger Border Color` is determined by the `Background Color`.\n\n*   BG Azure(8) => Trigger Border White(0) => Rules: White(0)->Gray(5), Red(2)->Green(3)\n*   BG Maroon(9) => Trigger Border Yellow(4) => Rules: Yellow(4)->Gray(5), Orange(7)->Green(3)\n*   BG Orange(7) => Trigger Border Magenta(6) => Rules: Blue(1)->Green(3), Magenta(6)->Gray(5)\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Mark all reachable `bg_color` pixels as 'outside'.\n3.  **Create Output Grid**: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n4.  **Iterate Through Pixels**: For each pixel `(r, c)` in the grid:\n    a.  **Check if Candidate**: Determine if the pixel at `(r, c)` is a potential candidate for transformation. It is a candidate if:\n        i.  It was *not* marked as 'outside' by the flood fill.\n        ii. Its color is *not* the `bg_color`.\n    b.  **Check Immediate Border**: If the pixel is a candidate, examine its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n        i.  If *any* neighbor is `bg_color` or outside the grid bounds, this pixel is touching the background directly or indirectly and is *not* eligible for transformation based on border color. Skip to the next pixel.\n        ii. If *all* neighbors are within bounds and are *not* `bg_color`, determine the color(s) of these neighbors. Assume for the transformation trigger that these neighbors share a single, uniform color (`border_color`).\n    c.  **Determine Trigger Border Color**: Based on the `bg_color`, identify the required `trigger_border_color`:\n        *   If `bg_color` is Azure (8), `trigger_border_color` is White (0).\n        *   If `bg_color` is Maroon (9), `trigger_border_color` is Yellow (4).\n        *   If `bg_color` is Orange (7), `trigger_border_color` is Magenta (6).\n    d.  **Apply Transformation Rules**: If the determined `border_color` from step 4.b.ii matches the `trigger_border_color` from step 4.c, apply the following color changes to the candidate pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid:\n        *   If `bg_color` is Azure (8) and `border_color` is White (0):\n            *   Change White (0) to Gray (5).\n            *   Change Red (2) to Green (3).\n        *   If `bg_color` is Maroon (9) and `border_color` is Yellow (4):\n            *   Change Yellow (4) to Gray (5).\n            *   Change Orange (7) to Green (3).\n        *   If `bg_color` is Orange (7) and `border_color` is Magenta (6):\n            *   Change Blue (1) to Green (3).\n            *   Change Magenta (6) to Gray (5).\n    e.  **No Change**: If the pixel is not a candidate, or its border doesn't match the trigger color, or its color doesn't match a rule, its color in the output grid remains unchanged from the input grid.\n5.  **Return Output Grid**: Return the completed output grid."
