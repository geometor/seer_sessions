Divide the input grid into four equal quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR). Let the dimensions of each quadrant be `h` rows and `w` columns.\n2.  Examine the Bottom-Right (BR) quadrant:\n    a.  If the BR quadrant consists entirely of white (0) pixels:\n        The output grid is an exact copy of the Bottom-Left (BL) quadrant.\n    b.  Else if the BR quadrant consists entirely of a single non-white color (`Color_BR`) AND the BL quadrant also consists entirely of a single non-white color (`Color_BL`):\n        Create a new grid with 3 rows and `w` columns. Fill the first row with `Color_BR`, the second with `Color_BL`, and the third with `Color_BR`.\n    c.  Else (the BR quadrant contains a pattern mixing white (0) and other colors):\n        i.  Determine the `Replacement_Color` by finding the most frequent non-white color in the BL quadrant.\n        ii. Create a temporary `Pattern_Grid` of size `h` x `w` by copying the BR quadrant and replacing every white (0) pixel with the `Replacement_Color`.\n        iii. Check the quadrant height `h`:\n            1.  If `h` is 4: Tile the `Pattern_Grid` 4x4 times to create a 16x16 output.\n            2.  If `h` is 8: Create a 10x10 output grid filled with `Replacement_Color`, then place the `Pattern_Grid` in the top-left 8x8 area.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef get_quadrants(grid):\n    \"\"\"Divides a grid into four equal quadrants.\"\"\"\n    h, w = grid.shape\n    h_half, w_half = h // 2, w // 2\n    tl = grid[0:h_half, 0:w_half]\n    tr = grid[0:h_half, w_half:w]\n    bl = grid[h_half:h, 0:w_half]\n    br = grid[h_half:h, w_half:w]\n    return tl, tr, bl, br\n\ndef is_solid_color(grid):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a grid consists of a single color.
