            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Colors:** The grids primarily use green (3), blue (1), red (2), and white (0). Green appears to be the background color in most cases.\n2.  **Objects:**\n    *   **Red Object:** In each input grid, there is exactly one contiguous object composed of red (2) pixels. Its shape varies (2x2 square, 3x3 square, single pixel).\n    *   **White Object(s):** Each input grid contains at least one contiguous object composed of white (0) pixels. The shape also varies (2x2, 3x3, single pixel). Some inputs have multiple white objects (e.g., train\\_2).\n    *   **Blue Path:** There are paths or areas composed of blue (1) pixels. These blue pixels appear to connect or lie between the red object and at least one white object.\n    *   **Background:** The most frequent color is green (3), acting as the background.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves a change related to the red and white objects.\n    *   The original red object's location is replaced with the background color (green, 3).\n    *   The location of *one* of the white objects is replaced with blue (1).\n4.  **Selection Criteria:** When multiple white objects exist (train\\_2), only one is affected. The blue path seems crucial for determining *which* white object is targeted. The affected white object appears to be the one \"closest\" to the red object, reachable via the blue path. Closeness here likely refers to the path distance traveling only through blue pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

The search progresses from a blue pixel only to adjacent (including diagonally) blue pixels that haven't been visited yet.\n    c.  During the search, at each step, check if the current blue pixel is adjacent (including diagonally) to any pixel belonging to *any* of the white objects identified in step 3.\n    d.  If such an adjacency is found, the corresponding white object is the 'target' white object. Record the coordinates of this target white object and stop the search.\n6.  Create the output grid by making a copy of the input grid.\n7.  Modify the output grid:\n    a.  For each coordinate recorded for the red object in step 2, change the pixel color at that coordinate in the output grid to the background color identified in step 1.\n    b.  For each coordinate recorded for the target white object in step 5d, change the pixel color at that coordinate in the output grid to blue (color 1).\n8.
