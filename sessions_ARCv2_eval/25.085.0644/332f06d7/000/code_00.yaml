  constants:
    - background_color: 3  # Green, typically the most frequent color
    - agent_color: 2       # Red
    - path_color: 1        # Blue
    - target_color: 0      # White
    - result_color: 1      # Blue (replaces target)
  objects:
    - id: red_object
      color: agent_color (2)
      count: 1
      description: A single contiguous object of red pixels.
    - id: white_objects
      color: target_color (0)
      count: 1 or more
      description: Contiguous objects of white pixels.
    - id: blue_path
      color: path_color (1)
      description: Contiguous or scattered blue pixels often forming a path or region connecting the red_object to one or more white_objects.
  relationships:
    - type: connectivity
      description: The red_object is connected to at least one white_object via adjacent blue_path pixels.
    - type: selection
      description: If multiple white_objects are connected to the red_object via the blue_path, the target white_object is the one reachable with the shortest path distance along the blue_path starting from the red_object. Adjacency includes diagonals.

      inputs: [red_object_coords, list_of_white_object_coords, blue_path_coords]
      outputs: [target_white_object_coords]
      description: Perform a shortest path search (e.g., BFS) starting from red_object, moving through adjacent blue_path pixels, to find the first reachable white_object.
