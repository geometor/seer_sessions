            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are square (27x27 in the examples).\n2.  **Background:** The predominant color is Yellow (4), acting as a background.\n3.  **Dividing Lines:** A consistent feature in all examples is a single horizontal Blue (1) line and a single vertical Blue (1) line. These lines intersect near the center of the grid.\n4.  **Quadrants:** These blue lines effectively divide the grid into four distinct quadrants: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right.\n5.  **Objects/Patterns:** Within the quadrants (excluding the dividing lines and background), there are distinct shapes or patterns composed of various colors (Azure-8, Red-2, Green-3 in train\\_1; Green-3, Azure-8, Maroon-9, Red-2, Blue-1 in train\\_2).\n6.  **Source Quadrant:** The pattern in the top-left quadrant of the input seems unique and serves as the basis for the transformation.\n7.  **Target Quadrants:** The patterns in the other three quadrants (top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) in the input are different from the top-left and appear to be replaced in the output.\n8.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves replicating the pattern from the top-left quadrant into the other three quadrants. This replication isn't a direct copy but involves reflections:\n    *   Top-Right: Horizontal reflection across the vertical blue line.\n    *   Bottom-Left: Vertical reflection across the horizontal blue line.\n    *   Bottom-Right: Both horizontal and vertical reflection (equivalent to a 180-degree rotation) around the intersection point of the blue lines.\n9.  **Invariance:** The background color (Yellow-4) and the dividing blue lines remain unchanged between input and output.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Identify the single horizontal line of Blue pixels (color 1); record its row index (`h_line_row`).\n3.  Identify the single vertical line of Blue pixels (color 1); record its column index (`v_line_col`).\n4.  Define the four quadrants based on these lines:\n    *   Top-Left: Rows 0 to `h_line_row - 1`, Columns 0 to `v_line_col - 1`.\n    *   Top-Right: Rows 0 to `h_line_row - 1`, Columns `v_line_col + 1` to end.\n    *   Bottom-Left: Rows `h_line_row + 1` to end, Columns 0 to `v_line_col - 1`.\n    *   Bottom-Right: Rows `h_line_row + 1` to end, Columns `v_line_col + 1` to end.\n5.  Extract the pattern from the Top-Left quadrant of the input grid. This \"source pattern\" consists of all pixels *not* matching the background color (Yellow-4). Store the relative coordinates and colors of these pixels with respect to the top-left corner (0,0) of the quadrant.\n6.  Clear the non-background, non-divider pixels in the Top-Right, Bottom-Left, and Bottom-Right quadrants of the output grid by setting them to the background color (Yellow-4).\n7.  Generate the Top-Right pattern: For each pixel `(r, c)` with color `C` in the source pattern (relative to quadrant corner), calculate its horizontally reflected position relative to the `v_line_col`. The new column is `v_line_col + (v_line_col - c)`. Place color `C` at `(r, v_line_col + (v_line_col - c))` in the output grid.\n8.  Generate the Bottom-Left pattern: For each pixel `(r, c)` with color `C` in the source pattern, calculate its vertically reflected position relative to the `h_line_row`. The new row is `h_line_row + (h_line_row - r)`. Place color `C` at `(h_line_row + (h_line_row - r), c)` in the output grid.\n9.  Generate the Bottom-Right pattern: For each pixel `(r, c)` with color `C` in the source pattern, calculate its doubly reflected position. The new row is `h_line_row + (h_line_row - r)`, and the new column is `v_line_col + (v_line_col - c)`. Place color `C` at `(h_line_row + (h_line_row - r), v_line_col + (v_line_col - c))` in the output grid.\n10. Return the modified output grid."
