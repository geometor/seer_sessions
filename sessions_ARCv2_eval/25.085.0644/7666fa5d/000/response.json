Let's call this the \"marker color\".\n    *   The output grid retains the background and marker colors in their original positions.\n    *   A new color, red (2), appears in the output grid.\n3.  **Transformation**: The red pixels are introduced in the output grid. Observing their placement, they always appear *between* two pixels of the marker color *within the same row*. Specifically, if a row contains multiple marker-colored pixels, the azure pixels located horizontally between consecutive marker pixels are changed to red. This happens for all such pairs within each row. If a row has fewer than two marker pixels, no red pixels are added to that row.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
