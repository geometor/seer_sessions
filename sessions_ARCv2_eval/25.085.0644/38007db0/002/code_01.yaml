task_description: Extract the rightmost repeating structural unit from the input grid.
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: Grid
    properties:
      - Contains content patterns that repeat horizontally.
      - Repeating patterns are separated by vertical lines of a single border_color.
      - The border_color typically also frames the entire grid.
  - name: border_color
    type: Color
    derivation: The color of the pixel at the top-left corner (0, 0) of the input_grid.
  - name: representative_row
    type: Row (List of Colors)
    derivation: The first row found in the input_grid (potentially starting search from index 1, or using index 0 if needed) that contains colors other than the border_color. This row exhibits the horizontal repetition structure.
  - name: content_width
    type: Integer
    derivation: In the representative_row, find the column indices of the border_color. The content_width is the difference between the second index and the first index. (Assumes at least two occurrences).
  - name: unit_width
    type: Integer
    description: The full width of one repeating structural unit, including its right separator border.
    derivation: content_width + 1.
  - name: output_grid
    type: Grid
    derivation: A subgrid extracted from the right side of the input_grid.
    properties:
      - Has the same height as the input_grid.
      - Has a width equal to unit_width.
actions:
  - name: Identify Border Color
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: border_color
    description: Get the color value at input_grid[0][0].
  - name: Find Representative Row
    inputs: input_grid, border_color
    outputs: representative_row (or its index)
    description: Iterate through rows of input_grid (e.g., starting from index 1) and return the first row found that contains any color different from border_color. Handle cases where no such row exists (e.g., fall back to row 0).
  - name: Calculate Unit Width
    inputs: representative_row, border_color, input_grid_width
    outputs: unit_width
    steps:
      - Find all column indices `border_indices` where `representative_row[col] == border_color`.
      - If `len(border_indices) >= 2`:
          - `content_width = border_indices[1] - border_indices[0]`
          - `unit_width = content_width + 1`
      - Else (fewer than 2 border occurrences found):
          - `unit_width = input_grid_width` # Fallback: assume the unit is the entire grid width.
  - name: Extract Rightmost Unit
    inputs: input_grid, unit_width
    outputs: output_grid
    steps:
      - Get input height `H` and width `W`.
      - Calculate `start_col = W - unit_width`.
      - `output_grid` is the slice `input_grid[0:H, start_col:W]`.
