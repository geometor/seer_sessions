- task_type: extraction # or selection, slicing
- grid_structure:
    - type: composite # grid composed of smaller subgrids/units
    - unit_arrangement: grid-like # tiled horizontally and vertically
    - separators: present # lines separating the units
      - property: single_color # separators are of one color
      - relation_to_border: same_color_as_outer_border # separator color matches grid's edge color
- objects:
    - object_type: repeating_unit
      - property: shape # square
      - property: size # constant within a task (e.g., 7x7 in examples)
      - identification: determined by separator lines
    - object_type: separator_line
      - property: color # consistent within a task
      - property: orientation # horizontal and vertical
- relationships:
    - input_output: output is a subgrid of input
    - subgrid_location: rightmost vertical section
    - subgrid_width: equal to repeating_unit width
    - subgrid_height: equal to input height
- actions:
    - identify: separator color and pattern (find repeating indices)
    - calculate: unit size (based on separator spacing)
    - calculate: starting column index for extraction (input_width - unit_size)
    - extract: subgrid using calculated start column, full height, and unit width
