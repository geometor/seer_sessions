**Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code failed because it incorrectly calculated the width of the repeating unit. It relied solely on the first row to find the border color and its second occurrence, which was misleading when the first row consisted entirely of the border color. The actual transformation involves identifying a repeating structural unit (content + separator) based on vertical border lines and extracting the rightmost complete unit.

The strategy is to refine the unit detection logic:
1.  Identify the border color (top-left pixel).
2.  Find a row that contains non-border colors to analyze the repeating pattern. Using the second row (index 1) worked for the examples, but a more robust approach would be to find the first row containing non-border colors.
3.  Determine the width of the content part of the pattern by finding the distance between the first two occurrences of the border color in that representative row.
4.  Calculate the full unit width by adding 1 (for the separator column) to the content width.
5.  Extract the rightmost columns corresponding to this full unit width.

**Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (19, 19)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (19, 7)
    *   Border Color: 1 (blue)
    *   Representative Row (Index 1): `1 6 6 6 6 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 1`
    *   Border Indices: `[0, 6, 12, 18]`
    *   Content Width (Difference between first two indices): `6 - 0 = 6`
    *   Full Unit Width (Content Width + 1): `6 + 1 = 7`
    *   Calculated Start Column (`Input Width - Unit Width`): `19 - 7 = 12`
    *   Calculated Output Shape: `(19, 7)` -> Matches Expected.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (19, 25)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (19, 7)
    *   Border Color: 3 (green)
    *   Representative Row (Index 1): `3 4 4 4 4 4 3 4 4 4 4 4 3 4 4 4 4 4 3 4 4 4 4 4 3`
    *   Border Indices: `[0, 6, 12, 18, 24]`
    *   Content Width (Difference between first two indices): `6 - 0 = 6`
    *   Full Unit Width (Content Width + 1): `6 + 1 = 7`
    *   Calculated Start Column (`Input Width - Unit Width`): `25 - 7 = 18`
    *   Calculated Output Shape: `(19, 7)` -> Matches Expected.

  - name: Determine Unit Width
    inputs: input_grid, border_color

    steps:
      - Find the first row index (`rep_row_idx`) where the row contains colors different from `border_color`.
      - Get the row `rep_row = input_grid[rep_row_idx]`.
      - Find all column indices `border_indices` where `rep_row[col] == border_color`.
      - Calculate `content_width = border_indices[1] - border_indices[0]`.
      - Calculate `unit_width = content_width + 1`.
  - name: Extract Rightmost Unit
    inputs: input_grid, unit_width
    outputs: output_grid
    steps:
      - Get input height `H` and width `W`.
      - Calculate `start_col = W - unit_width`.
      - `output_grid = input_grid[:, start_col:]` (all rows, columns from `start_col` to end).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Observe the input grid. Identify the color of the top-left pixel (at index 0,0) as the `border_color`.
2.  Scan the rows of the input grid, starting from the second row (index 1), to find the first row (`representative_row`) that contains at least one pixel whose color is different from the `border_color`. If no such row exists below the first, use the first row itself (index 0) as the `representative_row`.
3.  Within the `representative_row`, find the column indices where the `border_color` appears.
4.  Calculate the `content_width` by subtracting the index of the first occurrence of the `border_color` from the index of the second occurrence. If there is only one occurrence or fewer, assume the `content_width` is the total width of the grid minus 1.
5.  Determine the `unit_width` by adding 1 to the `content_width`. This accounts for the content and the separator border column.
6.  Determine the width `W` of the input grid.
7.  Calculate the starting column index `start_col` for the extraction by subtracting `unit_width` from `W`.
8.  Construct the output grid by extracting the subgrid from the input grid that includes all rows and the columns from `start_col` to the end (`W-1`).**General Assessment:**

The previous code failed because its method for determining the repeating unit size was flawed. It relied only on the first row and the second occurrence of the border color, which resulted in an incorrect unit size (often 1) when the first row consisted entirely of the border color. The analysis of the failed examples and the metric calculations confirm that the transformation involves identifying a horizontally repeating structural unit (composed of content and a vertical separator) and extracting the rightmost instance of this unit.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

The core issue lies in correctly identifying the width of the repeating unit. The strategy is to:
1.  Robustly identify the border/separator color.
2.  Find a row suitable for analyzing the pattern's horizontal repetition (i.e., a row containing non-border colors).
3.  Calculate the width of the pattern's content based on the spacing between border colors in that representative row.
4.  Determine the full unit width (content + separator).
5.  Extract the rightmost subgrid matching this unit width.

**Metrics:**

Based on the `code_output` from the analysis tool:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (19, 19)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (19, 7)
    *   Border Color: 1 (blue)
    *   Representative Row Index: 1
    *   Content Width (from border indices [0, 6, ...]): 6
    *   Calculated Unit Width (Content + 1): 7
    *   Calculated Output Shape: (19, 7) -> Matches Expected.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (19, 25)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (19, 7)
    *   Border Color: 3 (green)
    *   Representative Row Index: 1
    *   Content Width (from border indices [0, 6, ...]): 6
    *   Calculated Unit Width (Content + 1): 7
    *   Calculated Output Shape: (19, 7) -> Matches Expected.

The revised logic for calculating the unit width based on a representative row correctly predicts the output shape for both failed examples.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Separator:** Determine the `border_color` by taking the color of the pixel at the top-left corner (row 0, column 0) of the input grid.
2.  **Find Pattern Row:** Search the input grid, starting from the second row (index 1), to locate the first row (`representative_row`) that contains at least one pixel with a color different from the `border_color`. If all rows below the first consist only of the `border_color`, use the first row (index 0) as the `representative_row`.
3.  **Measure Pattern Width:** Within the `representative_row`, find the column indices where the `border_color` appears. Calculate the `content_width` as the difference between the second index and the first index. (If fewer than two `border_color` occurrences are found in this row, assume the entire grid width is the unit width and proceed to step 5 using the grid's width).
4.  **Calculate Unit Width:** Determine the total width of the repeating structural unit (`unit_width`) by adding 1 to the `content_width`.
5.  **Extract Rightmost Unit:** Calculate the starting column index (`start_col`) by subtracting the `unit_width` from the total width of the input grid. The output grid is formed by selecting all rows from the input grid and the columns from `start_col` to the end.
