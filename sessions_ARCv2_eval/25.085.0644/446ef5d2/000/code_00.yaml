task_description: Filter out pixels of a specific color (Yellow 4) and preserve all other non-background pixels in their original positions.

definitions:
  background_color: 8  # Azure
  discard_color: 4     # Yellow

grid_properties:
  - input_output_size_preservation: True

transformations:
  - type: filter_and_preserve
    filter_condition:
      # Pixels to be replaced by the background color
      - color: discard_color
      - color: background_color
    preserve_condition:
      # Pixels to keep in their original position
      - color: any_other_color # Any color not matching background_color or discard_color
    output_generation:
      - description: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the background_color.
      - description: For each pixel in the input grid, if its color meets the preserve_condition, place that color at the corresponding position in the output grid. Otherwise, the output grid retains the background_color at that position.

examples:
  example_1:
    preserved_colors: [7, 2, 0] # Orange, Red, White
    discarded_pixels_color: 4    # Yellow
    background_color: 8        # Azure
  example_2:
    preserved_colors: [3, 9] # Green, Maroon
    discarded_pixels_color: 4    # Yellow
    background_color: 8        # Azure
