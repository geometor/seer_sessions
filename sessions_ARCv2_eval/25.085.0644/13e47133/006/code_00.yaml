task_description: Fill background pixels within four quadrants defined by Red lines, based on the color of 'initiator' pixels (non-background, non-Red). A special rule applies to the bottom-left quadrant.

grid_properties:
  - common:
      divider_color: 2 # Red
      quadrant_definition:
        vertical_line: Column index 'v' where all pixels are Red.
        horizontal_line: Row index 'h' where Red pixels exist at (h, v) and horizontally adjacent (typically (h, v+1), but might just need any horizontal segment intersecting the vertical line at row h).
        quadrants: TL(<h, <v), TR(<h, >v), BL(>=h, <v), BR(>=h, >v) # Note: row h belongs to BL/BR
  - example_1:
      dimensions: [20, 20]
      background_color: 1 # Blue
      intersection_point: {h: 9, v: 8}
      input_initiators:
        - { color: 7, row: 0, col: 0 } # TL
        - { color: 8, row: 1, col: 1 } # TL
        - { color: 8, row: 0, col: 19 } # TR
        - { color: 4, row: 1, col: 18 } # TR
        - { color: 3, row: 10, col: 15 } # BR
        - { color: 4, row: 11, col: 14 } # BR
      input_BL_initiators_present: false
  - example_2:
      dimensions: [20, 20]
      background_color: 4 # Yellow
      intersection_point: {h: 12, v: 10}
      input_initiators:
        - { color: 3, row: 1, col: 1 } # TL
        - { color: 8, row: 0, col: 11 } # TR
        - { color: 1, row: 1, col: 12 } # TR
        - { color: 5, row: 13, col: 11 } # BR
        - { color: 0, row: 14, col: 12 } # BR
        - { color: 1, row: 15, col: 13 } # BR
      input_BL_initiators_present: false

transformation:
  - step_1_structure_id: Identify background color, Red divider lines, and intersection point (h, v).
  - step_2_initiator_id: Locate all non-background, non-Red pixels (initiators) in the input grid.
  - step_3_quadrant_fill:
      goal: Fill background pixels in output grid quadrants (TL, TR, BR) based on initiators within that quadrant.
      current_method_issue: Manhattan distance Voronoi fill is incorrect. The actual fill pattern differs significantly.
      observation: The fill seems to expand from initiators, possibly axis-aligned or flood-fill like, respecting quadrant boundaries. Tie-breaking (color, row, col) likely still applies.
  - step_4_BL_quadrant_rule:
      condition: Check if the *input* grid's BL quadrant contains any initiators.
      action_if_false:
        current_method_issue: Generate the *output* BL quadrant by reflecting the bottom part of the *output* TL quadrant, potentially repeating the last reflected row if BL is taller. This depends on a correctly filled TL and might be the wrong mechanism.
        observation_example_1: BL (expected) looks like a vertical reflection of the bottom `h_bl` rows of TL (expected). `h_tl=9`, `h_bl=11`. `min(9,11)=9`. Rows 10-19 (10 rows) of BL should reflect rows 0-8 (9 rows) of TL? No, reflect rows `h_tl-h_copy` to `h_tl` = rows 0 to 8 of TL onto rows 9 to 17 of BL. The last row (row 9 of TL) would be reflected to row 9 of BL. Then repeat row 9 of BL for rows 18, 19.
        observation_example_2: BL (expected) looks like a vertical reflection of the bottom part of TL (expected). `h_tl=12`, `h_bl=8`. `min(12,8)=8`. Rows `12-8=4` to 11 of TL (8 rows) should be reflected onto rows 12 to 19 (8 rows) of BL.
        hypothesis: The reflection/repetition logic seems plausible based on expected outputs, but it requires the TL fill to be correct first. The core issue remains the fill algorithm in step 3.
      action_if_true:
        current_method_issue: If input BL *has* initiators, the current code fills it using the same (incorrect) Voronoi logic as other quadrants.
        observation: No examples provided where input BL has initiators, so this path cannot be verified yet.

required_updates:
  - Refine the quadrant filling algorithm (Step 3). Explore alternatives to Manhattan Voronoi (e.g., axis-aligned expansion, flood fill).
  - Verify the reflection/repetition logic (Step 4) once the TL fill is correct.
