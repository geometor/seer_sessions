*   **Perception**:
    *   The input and output grids are the same size (16x16 in the examples).
    *   The dominant color in all grids is orange (7), acting as a background.
    *   The grids contain various "objects" composed of contiguous pixels of colors other than orange (7).
    *   Some of these objects contain white (0) pixels.
    *   Comparing input and output grids, some objects present in the input are replaced entirely by the background color (orange, 7) in the output, while others remain unchanged.
    *   The objects that are removed seem to contain white (0) pixels and are "floating" â€“ they do not touch the edges of the grid.
    *   Objects that either do not contain white (0) pixels or touch at least one edge of the grid remain unchanged in the output.

*   **Facts YAML**:
    
```yaml
    background_color: 7 # orange
    grid_dimensions:
      # Examples show 16x16, but could vary per ARC task standard (1x1 to 30x30)
      height: 16
      width: 16
    objects:
      definition: Contiguous regions of pixels with colors other than the background_color (7).
      properties:
        - pixels: List of coordinates and colors composing the object.
        - contains_white: Boolean, true if any pixel in the object has color 0 (white).
        - touches_border: Boolean, true if any pixel in the object is located at row 0, the last row, column 0, or the last column.
    transformation:
      action: Replace object pixels with background_color (7).
      condition: Applies only to objects where 'contains_white' is true AND 'touches_border' is false.
      target: Objects meeting the condition.
      otherwise: Keep object pixels unchanged.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the background color as orange (7).
    2.  Find all distinct contiguous objects formed by pixels that are not the background color.
    3.  For each identified object:
        a.  Check if the object contains any white (0) pixels.
        b.  Check if any pixel belonging to the object lies on the border of the grid (top, bottom, left, or right edge).
        c.  If the object *contains* white (0) pixels AND *does not* touch any border of the grid, then replace all pixels belonging to this object with the background color (orange, 7).
    4.  Leave all other pixels (belonging to the background or to objects not meeting the condition in step 3c) unchanged.
