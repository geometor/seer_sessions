The background color is consistently orange (7). The modifications appear to be color-specific rules involving horizontal extension or contraction relative to neighbors or the position of maroon (9) pixels.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Determine the maximum column index (`max_col_maroon`) occupied by any maroon (9) pixel across the entire input grid. If no maroon pixels are present, set `max_col_maroon` to the last column index of the grid (width - 1).\n    3.  **Process Red Pixels:** Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid. If the input cell `(r, c)` is red (2) and its left neighbor `(r, c-1)` exists (`c > 0`) and is orange (7) in the input grid, set the corresponding cell `(r, c-1)` in the output grid to red (2).\n    4.  **Process Gray Pixels:** Iterate through each row `r` of the output grid. Within each row, repeatedly scan from left to right (`c` from 0 to width-2). If a cell `(r, c)` is gray (5) and the cell to its right `(r, c+1)` is orange (7) and the column index `c+1` is less than or equal to `max_col_maroon`, change the cell `(r, c+1)` to gray (5). Continue scanning and modifying the row until a full pass results in no changes for that row.\n    5.  **Process Green Pixels:** Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the output grid. If the cell `(r, c)` is green (3) and its column index `c` is greater than `max_col_maroon`, change the cell `(r, c)` to orange (7).\n    6.  Return the modified output grid."
