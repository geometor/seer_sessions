            "text": "*   **Perception:** The task involves rearranging blocks of pixels within a grid. The input grids contain distinct rectangular blocks separated by lines of a specific color (magenta, 6). The arrangement and orientation of these blocks change between the input and output.\n*   **Segmentation:** Magenta (6) lines, either horizontal rows or vertical columns that span the grid, act as separators, dividing the input grid into smaller rectangular subgrids (blocks).\n*   **Transformation:** The core operation is to extract these blocks and reassemble them in a new configuration.\n*   **Orientation Change:** The orientation of the separators in the input determines the orientation of the assembly in the output.\n    *   If the input has only horizontal magenta separators, the blocks are arranged horizontally in the output, separated by vertical magenta lines.\n    *   If the input has only vertical magenta separators, the blocks are stacked vertically in the output, separated by horizontal magenta lines.\n    *   If the input has both horizontal and vertical magenta separators (forming a grid of blocks), the blocks are stacked vertically in the output, separated by horizontal magenta lines.\n*   **Ordering:** The order in which blocks are reassembled depends on the initial segmentation:\n    *   Input with only horizontal separators: Blocks are ordered from bottom to top (reverse order of appearance).\n    *   Input with only vertical separators: Blocks are ordered from left to right (normal order of appearance).\n    *   Input with both horizontal and vertical separators (a 2x2 arrangement): Blocks are ordered specifically as Top-Left, Bottom-Right, Top-Right, Bottom-Left.\n*   **Separators:** The magenta lines used for separation in the input are reused in the output, but their orientation changes (horizontal becomes vertical, vertical becomes horizontal). A single row or column of magenta is used between blocks in the output.\n\n"
