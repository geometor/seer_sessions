1.  Identify the separator color, which is magenta (6).
2.  Scan the input grid to find all full horizontal rows and full vertical columns composed entirely of the separator color.
3.  Determine the type of segmentation based on the separators found: "horizontal", "vertical", or "both".
4.  Extract the rectangular subgrids (blocks) located between the separators. Record the original position of each block (e.g., its row and column index in the grid of blocks).
5.  Determine the orientation for arranging blocks in the output grid:
    a. If the segmentation type is "horizontal", the output orientation is horizontal.
    b. If the segmentation type is "vertical" or "both", the output orientation is vertical.
6.  Determine the order of the extracted blocks for assembly:
    a. If the output orientation is horizontal (input segmentation was "horizontal"), order the blocks by their original row index in descending order (bottom-most block first).
    b. If the output orientation is vertical and the input segmentation was "vertical", order the blocks by their original column index in ascending order (left-most block first).
    c. If the output orientation is vertical and the input segmentation was "both" (forming a 2x2 grid of blocks: Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right), order the blocks in the specific sequence: Top-Left, Bottom-Right, Top-Right, Bottom-Left.
7.  Construct the output grid:
    a. If the output orientation is vertical, stack the ordered blocks vertically, placing a single horizontal row of the separator color (magenta 6) between each adjacent pair of blocks.
    b. If the output orientation is horizontal, arrange the ordered blocks horizontally, placing a single vertical column of the separator color (magenta 6) between each adjacent pair of blocks.
