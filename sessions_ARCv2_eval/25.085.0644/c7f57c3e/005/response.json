Determine the background color (most frequent color).\n2. Identify all non-background colors present in the grid.\n3. For each non-background color:\n    a. Find all distinct contiguous objects of that color.\n    b. Count the number of objects found.\n    c. Calculate the total number of pixels (area) for that color.\n4. Group the non-background colors by their object count.\n5. Determine the minimum object count found.\n6. Among the colors with the minimum object count, select the one with the smallest total pixel area. If there's a tie in area, select the color with the highest numerical color value. This is 'color1'.\n7. Determine the second minimum object count found.\n8. Among the colors with the second minimum object count, select the one with the smallest total pixel area. If there's a tie in area, select the color with the highest numerical color value. This is 'color2'.\n9. Create a copy of the input grid.\n10.
