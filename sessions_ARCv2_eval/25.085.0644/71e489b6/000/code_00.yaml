description: Summary of observations from the task examples.
elements:
  - role: pixels
    properties:
      - color: Represents the value (0-9) of a pixel. Specific colors observed are white (0), blue (1), and orange (7).
      - location: The (row, column) coordinate of a pixel within the grid.
  - role: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: Height and width of the grid.
      - structure: A 2D array of pixels.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share an edge or a corner (Moore neighborhood).
    applies_to:
      - role: pixels
transformation:
  - type: color_change
    description: Blue pixels change to orange under specific conditions.
    conditions:
      - property: color
        value: blue (1)
      - relationship: adjacency
        target_role: pixels
        target_property: color
        target_value: white (0)
        details: The blue pixel must have at least one white neighbor (including diagonals).
    output_property: color
    output_value: orange (7)
  - type: color_persistence
    description: Pixels retain their color if conditions for change are not met.
    conditions:
      - property: color
        value: white (0)
      - or:
        - property: color
          value: blue (1)
        - relationship: adjacency
          negate: true # The blue pixel does NOT have any white neighbors
          target_role: pixels
          target_property: color
          target_value: white (0)
    output_property: color
    output_value: original_color
