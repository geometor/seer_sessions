Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Colors:** The input grids primarily consist of blue pixels (1) and white pixels (0). Other colors are not present in the inputs.
2.  **Output Grid Colors:** The output grids retain the blue (1) and white (0) pixels from the input but also introduce orange pixels (7).
3.  **Spatial Relationship:** The orange pixels (7) in the output consistently appear adjacent (including diagonally) to the white pixels (0) that were present in the input.
4.  **Transformation:** It appears that blue pixels (1) in the input are transformed into orange pixels (7) in the output *if and only if* they are adjacent (including diagonals) to at least one white pixel (0) in the input.
5.  **White Pixel Invariance:** White pixels (0) in the input remain white pixels (0) in the output.
6.  **Blue Pixel Conditional Invariance:** Blue pixels (1) in the input that are *not* adjacent (including diagonals) to any white pixel (0) remain blue pixels (1) in the output.
7.  **Neighborhood:** The transformation rule seems to operate based on the immediate 8 neighbors (Moore neighborhood) of each pixel.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially copying all pixel values from the input grid. This will be the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel in the input grid using its row and column index.
3.  For the current pixel, check its color in the input grid.
4.  If the current pixel's color is blue (1):
    a.  Examine all 8 neighbors (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) of the current pixel within the bounds of the input grid.
    b.  Check if any of these neighbors in the input grid have the color white (0).
    c.  If at least one neighbor is white (0), change the color of the corresponding pixel (at the same row and column) in the *output* grid to orange (7).
5.  If the current pixel's color in the input grid is not blue (1), or if it is blue (1) but none of its neighbors are white (0), the corresponding pixel in the output grid keeps its copied value (either white (0) or blue (1)).
6.  After iterating through all pixels, return the completed output grid.
