            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\nThe input grids contain various colored shapes, some scattered randomly and others arranged within a distinct rectangular frame made of gray (5) pixels. The background color varies between examples (azure=8 or white=1). The output grids are smaller than the inputs and consist *only* of a gray frame and the contents that were inside the input frame, but with modifications.\n\nThe core operation seems to be:\n1.  Isolating the content within the gray frame in the input.\n2.  Identifying the background color *inside* this frame.\n3.  Potentially trimming rows/columns from the edges of this inner content if they solely consist of the background color.\n4.  Creating a new output grid sized to fit this (potentially trimmed) inner content plus a new gray frame border.\n5.  Applying a color transformation to the pixels of the (potentially trimmed) inner content. This transformation rule depends on the background color identified in step 2.\n6.  Placing the transformed content inside the new gray frame in the output grid.\n\nThe shapes and their relative positions inside the frame seem preserved, but their colors change based on the specific rule set determined by the inner background color.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Identify the largest connected rectangular region composed solely of gray (5) pixels in the input grid. Define its bounding box as the `frame_bbox`.\n2.  Extract the subgrid corresponding to the area strictly inside the `frame_bbox`. This is the `inner_content`.\n3.  Determine the most frequent pixel color within `inner_content`. This is the `background_color`.\n4.  Create a copy of `inner_content` called `trimmed_inner_content`.\n5.  Repeatedly check the top row, bottom row, leftmost column, and rightmost column of `trimmed_inner_content`. If any of these boundary lines consist entirely of the `background_color`, remove that line from `trimmed_inner_content`. Continue this process until no more boundary lines can be removed.\n6.  Calculate the dimensions of the final `trimmed_inner_content`: `trimmed_height` and `trimmed_width`.\n7.  Create a new output grid with dimensions (`trimmed_height` + 2) x (`trimmed_width` + 2), initialized entirely with gray (5) pixels.\n8.  Define the color mapping based on the `background_color`:\n    *   If `background_color` is Azure (8): Blue (1) maps to Yellow (4), Green (3) maps to Red (2). Azure (8) maps to Azure (8). All other colors map to themselves.\n    *   If `background_color` is White (1): Red (2) maps to Yellow (4), Green (3) maps to Orange (7), Magenta (6) maps to Azure (8). White (1) maps to White (1). All other colors map to themselves.\n9.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of `trimmed_inner_content` (using 0-based indexing relative to its own top-left corner).\n10. Get the `input_color` at `(r, c)`.\n11. Apply the color mapping defined in step 8 to find the `output_color`.\n12. Set the pixel at position `(r + 1, c + 1)` in the output grid to the `output_color`.\n13. Return the completed output grid."
