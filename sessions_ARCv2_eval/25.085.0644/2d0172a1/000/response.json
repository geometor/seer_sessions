The input grid primarily consists of two colors: a dominant background color and a secondary foreground color. The foreground color pixels are scattered across the input grid. The output grid is a smaller grid that represents a consolidated view of the foreground pixels from the input. Specifically, it seems to capture the pattern formed by the foreground pixels within their minimal bounding box in the input, and then frames this pattern with a border of the same foreground color, placing the result on the background color.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Draw a 1-pixel thick border around the perimeter of the output grid using the foreground color identified in step 2.\n9.  Iterate through the pixels within the calculated bounding box in the *input* grid (from minimum row/column to maximum row/column).\n10. For each pixel from the input grid's bounding box, copy its color to the corresponding position in the *output* grid, offset by (1, 1) to account for the border (i.e., input pixel at (r, c) within the bounding box goes to output grid at (r - min_row + 1, c - min_col + 1))."
