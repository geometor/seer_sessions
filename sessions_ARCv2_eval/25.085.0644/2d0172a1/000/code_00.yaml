InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Type: 2D Array (Grid)
    - Colors: Contains primarily two colors.
    - BackgroundColor: The color occupying the majority of the grid cells.
    - ForegroundColor: The color of the scattered pixels/shapes.
    - ForegroundPixels: A set of coordinates where the ForegroundColor is present.

DerivedElements:
  - BoundingBox:
      Type: Rectangle
      Definition: The smallest rectangular area in the InputGrid that encloses all ForegroundPixels.
      Properties:
        - min_row
        - max_row
        - min_col
        - max_col
  - ExtractedSubgrid:
      Type: 2D Array (Grid)
      Definition: The portion of the InputGrid corresponding to the BoundingBox.
      Properties:
        - Contains both BackgroundColor and ForegroundColor pixels as they appear within the BoundingBox in the InputGrid.
        - Height: BoundingBox.max_row - BoundingBox.min_row + 1
        - Width: BoundingBox.max_col - BoundingBox.min_col + 1

OutputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Type: 2D Array (Grid)
    - Dimensions:
        - Height: ExtractedSubgrid.Height + 2
        - Width: ExtractedSubgrid.Width + 2
    - BackgroundColor: Same as InputGrid.BackgroundColor.
    - ForegroundColor: Same as InputGrid.ForegroundColor.
    - Structure:
        - A border (1 pixel thick) made of the ForegroundColor surrounds the entire grid.
        - The inner area (corresponding to the ExtractedSubgrid dimensions) contains the pattern from the ExtractedSubgrid. Pixels in this inner area are copied directly from the ExtractedSubgrid (maintaining their original colors - Foreground or Background).

Relationships:
  - The OutputGrid's dimensions are determined by the BoundingBox of the ForegroundPixels in the InputGrid.
  - The colors used in the OutputGrid are the same two colors found in the InputGrid.
  - The pattern inside the OutputGrid's border is a direct copy of the pixels within the BoundingBox from the InputGrid.

Actions:
  1. Identify BackgroundColor and ForegroundColor in the InputGrid.
  2. Locate all ForegroundPixels in the InputGrid.
  3. Calculate the BoundingBox enclosing all ForegroundPixels.
  4. Extract the ExtractedSubgrid from the InputGrid using the BoundingBox coordinates.
  5. Create the OutputGrid with dimensions based on the ExtractedSubgrid plus a border.
  6. Fill the OutputGrid initially with the BackgroundColor.
  7. Draw a border using the ForegroundColor around the OutputGrid.
  8. Copy the pixels from the ExtractedSubgrid into the corresponding inner area of the OutputGrid.
