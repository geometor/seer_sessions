task_elements:
  - grid:
      properties: [2D, variable_size]
  - pixels:
      colors:
        - orange: 7 (background)
        - magenta: 6 (source, fill_color)
        - red: 2 (barrier)
objects:
  - background:
      color: orange (7)
      role: fillable_area
  - sources:
      color: magenta (6)
      description: Initial pixels that initiate the fill.
      persistence: Remain magenta in output.
  - barriers:
      color: red (2)
      description: Pixels that block the fill propagation.
      persistence: Remain red in output.
  - boundaries:
      description: The edges of the grid.
      role: Implicit barriers to fill propagation.
transformation:
  type: propagation/flood_fill
  initial_state: Input grid.
  process:
    - identify: All magenta (6) pixels as starting points.
    - propagation_rule:
        from: Any magenta (6) pixel (initial or filled).
        to: Cardinally adjacent orange (7) pixels.
        action: Change the adjacent orange (7) pixel to magenta (6).
    - stopping_conditions:
        - Encountering a red (2) pixel.
        - Encountering a grid boundary.
        - Encountering an already magenta (6) pixel.
    - iteration: Continue propagation until no more orange pixels can be changed in a full pass.
  final_state: Output grid with filled magenta areas.
relationships:
  - adjacency: Cardinal adjacency drives the propagation.
  - blocking: Red pixels and grid boundaries block magenta propagation.
