The transformation seems to focus on the two rightmost pixels in each row of the input grid and maps them to specific columns in the output grid. The background color remains the same, and the grid dimensions are preserved. The core operation appears to be a projection or consolidation of information from each row onto two specific target columns, determined by the overall grid content.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify the column index of the rightmost column containing any non-background pixel across the entire input grid. Call this `max_col`.\n3.  Identify the column index of the rightmost column *before* `max_col` that contains any non-background pixel across the entire input grid. Call this `col_R2`. If no such column exists (i.e., all non-background pixels are in `max_col`), consider `col_R2` to be undefined or handle as a special case (though examples suggest `col_R2` usually exists).\n4.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color.\n5.  Process each row of the input grid individually, from top to bottom (row index `r` from 0 to height-1):\n    a.  Find all non-background pixels within the current row `r`.\n    b.  If non-background pixels exist in row `r`:\n        i.  Sort these pixels based on their column index in descending order.\n        ii. Let the pixel with the highest column index be `P1` (the rightmost pixel in the row) with color `V1`. Place color `V1` into the output grid at position (`r`, `max_col`).\n        iii. If there is at least one more non-background pixel in the sorted list (i.e., the row had at least two non-background pixels), let the pixel with the second-highest column index be `P2` (the second rightmost) with color `V2`. Place color `V2` into the output grid at position (`r`, `col_R2`).\n6.  The final state of the new grid is the result."
