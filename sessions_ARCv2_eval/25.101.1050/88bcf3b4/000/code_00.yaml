task_context:
  problem_type: grid_transformation
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions_preserved: True
    - background_color_preserved: True
    - cell_values: integers 0-9 (colors)
transformation_elements:
  target_columns:
    - identification: Determined by the overall content of the input grid.
    - role: Serve as the destination columns for projected pixels.
    - definition:
        - rightmost_column (max_col): The column with the largest index containing any non-background pixel in the input grid.
        - second_rightmost_column (col_R2): The column with the largest index less than max_col that contains any non-background pixel in the input grid.
  pixel_selection:
    - scope: Performed row by row on the input grid.
    - criteria: Identify the non-background pixels in the current row.
    - focus: Primarily on the one or two rightmost non-background pixels within the row.
  pixel_mapping:
    - scope: Maps selected input pixels to the output grid.
    - logic:
        - The rightmost non-background pixel of input row `r` is mapped to output row `r` at column `max_col`.
        - The second rightmost non-background pixel (if it exists) of input row `r` is mapped to output row `r` at column `col_R2`.
    - collision_handling: Implicitly handled by the selection; only the two rightmost pixels influence the output for that row in the target columns. Other pixels in the row are ignored for this projection.
  background_pixels:
    - handling: Fill all cells in the output grid initially. Cells not overwritten by the mapping remain background color.
objects:
  - type: Pixels
    properties:
      - color (value 0-9)

relationships:
  - pixel_in_row: A pixel belongs to a specific row.
