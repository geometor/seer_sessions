task_context:
  problem_type: grid_transformation
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions_preserved: True
    - background_color_preserved: True # Mostly, output fill based on input bg
    - cell_values: integers 0-9 (colors)
transformation_elements:
  target_columns:
    - identification: The two rightmost columns in the input grid that contain any non-background pixels.
    - definition:
        - C1: The column with the largest index containing any non-background pixel.
        - C2: The column with the largest index strictly less than C1 containing any non-background pixel.
    - role: These are the only columns potentially modified or containing non-background pixels in the output (except for cases like Ex2, suggesting this might be incomplete).
  key_pixels:
    - identification: The topmost non-background pixel within column C1 and C2 of the input grid.
    - definition:
        - V_top_C1: Value of the non-background pixel with the minimum row index in input column C1.
        - R_top_C1: Row index of V_top_C1.
        - V_top_C2: Value of the non-background pixel with the minimum row index in input column C2.
        - R_top_C2: Row index of V_top_C2.
    - role: Their values (V_top_C1, V_top_C2) are used for filling background cells above them in the output columns C1 and C2 under specific conditions.
  pixel_mapping_logic:
    - scope: Operates primarily on output columns C1 and C2.
    - base_copy: Pixels from input columns C1 and C2 are conditionally copied to the corresponding output columns.
    - upward_fill_C1: Background cells in output column C1 *above* R_top_C1 are filled with the value V_top_C2.
    - upward_fill_C2: Background cells in output column C2 *above* R_top_C2 are filled with the value V_top_C2, but *only* if certain conditions involving the content of input/output column C1 at that same row are met.
  background_pixels:
    - handling: Output grid is initialized with the input's background color. All cells outside columns C1 and C2 remain background. Cells within C1/C2 not explicitly assigned a color remain background.
