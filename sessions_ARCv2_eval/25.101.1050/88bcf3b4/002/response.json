            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial analysis identified a pattern involving the two rightmost non-background pixels in each row being projected onto two specific columns (`max_col`, `col_R2`) determined by the overall grid content. However, testing this hypothesis using the provided code showed significant discrepancies between the transformed output and the expected output across multiple examples.\n\nThe core issue seems to be the determination of the target columns and the mapping logic. While the output grids consistently show non-background pixels concentrated in specific columns (often the rightmost two that contained pixels in the input), the values placed in these columns, especially in the second target column (`C2`), and the appearance of pixels in rows that were empty in the input, suggest a more complex vertical interaction or propagation rule within these columns, potentially influenced by the topmost pixel in each column.\n\nHypotheses involving copying columns C1 and C2 directly, or propagating values downwards, did not match. Hypotheses involving propagating the topmost pixel's value upwards within columns C1 and C2 (Hypotheses 6-11) showed promise, particularly for Example 1. Hypothesis 11c achieved the closest match for Example 1 by defining specific interaction rules for upward filling in C1 and C2 based on each other's topmost pixel and content. However, even H11c failed to generalize correctly to Example 2, which exhibited output content in columns *other* than the rightmost two (C1, C2), suggesting the fundamental assumption about processing only C1 and C2 might be incorrect or incomplete.\n\n**Strategy:** The most promising approach (H11c) correctly models Example 1 almost perfectly. The failure on Example 2 suggests either Example 2 represents a different variation of the rule, or the rule itself needs further refinement, perhaps considering more columns or a different method for selecting the \"key\" columns and their interaction. Given the success on Example 1, we will proceed with the logic from Hypothesis 11c, acknowledging it might not cover all examples perfectly.\n\n**Metrics (Recap)**\nThe code execution confirmed the identification of background color (`bg`), rightmost column with non-background pixels (`C1`), second rightmost column (`C2`), and the row/value of the topmost non-background pixel in those columns (`topmost_C1`, `topmost_C2`) for each example input.\n\n| Example | bg | C1 | C2 | Topmost C1 (Row, Val) | Topmost C2 (Row, Val) |\n| :------ | :- | :- | :- | :-------------------- | :-------------------- |\n| 1       | 0  | 5  | 4  | (1, 2)                | (3, 4)                |\n| 2       | 7  | 7  | 6  | (5, 2)                | (5, 3)                |\n| 3       | 1  | 13 | 12 | (2, 7)                | (2, 7)                |\n| 4       | 0  | 4  | 3  | (4, 5)                | (1, 3)                |\n| 5       | 0  | 5  | 4  | (5, 6)                | (5, 9)                |\n\n---\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Find the topmost (minimum row index) non-background pixel in input column `C1`. Let its row be `R_top_C1` and its value be `V_top_C1`. If column `C1` has no non-background pixels, set `V_top_C1` to `bg` and `R_top_C1` to infinity (or grid height).\n5.  Find the topmost (minimum row index) non-background pixel in input column `C2`. Let its row be `R_top_C2` and its value be `V_top_C2`. If column `C2` has no non-background pixels (or `C2` wasn't found), set `V_top_C2` to `bg` and `R_top_C2` to infinity (or grid height).\n6.
