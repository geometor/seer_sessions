            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.\n\n**1. General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code failed on all three training examples, indicating fundamental issues with the proposed logic or its implementation:\n\n*   **Color Identification:** The heuristic of identifying the fill color as the *least frequent interface color* failed dramatically in Example 3, selecting the wrong color (Azure instead of Green). It also seems problematic in Example 1, although it picked the correct color (Maroon), the subsequent fill was incorrect. The heuristic needs replacement with a more robust method based on comparing input and output changes.\n*   **Flood Fill Logic (`flood_fill`)**: In Example 1, the flood fill incorrectly filled almost the entire grid with the fill color (Maroon), rather than just the background color (Blue). This suggests the condition `if grid[nr][nc] == background_color:` might not be working as intended, or the propagation is flawed.\n*   **Left Fill Logic (`left_fill`)**: In Example 2, the left fill did not propagate at all. The implementation needs correction to ensure it iteratively fills background pixels to the left of existing fill-color pixels.\n*   **Fill Type Determination**: Basing the fill type solely on the background color (White -> Left Fill) is likely an oversimplification derived from a single example and needs a more general rule.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Improve Color Identification:** Implement a new heuristic based on comparing input and output grids:\n    *   Identify colors present in both.\n    *   Candidate Background Color(s): Color(s) with high frequency in the input that significantly decrease in the output.\n    *   Candidate Fill Color(s): Color(s) with low frequency in the input that significantly increase in the output, often replacing candidate background color(s).\n    *   Boundary Color(s): Colors whose pixels remain largely unchanged between input and output and are often adjacent to the changed areas. Select the most likely candidates based on these criteria.\n2.  **Refine Fill Logic:**\n    *   Correct `flood_fill` to strictly only replace pixels matching the `background_color`.\n    *   Correct `left_fill` to properly propagate leftwards iteratively.\n3.  **Generalize Fill Type Determination:** Analyze the spatial relationship between the initial fill pixels (seeds) and the final filled area. If the expansion is predominantly unidirectional (e.g., leftwards), choose directional fill; otherwise, default to flood fill.\n4.  **Validate:** Test the refined logic against all training examples.\n\n**2. Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's gather precise data about colors and changes.\n"

Boundary should be unchanged pixels adjacent to changed pixels, *excluding* the fill color itself if it was already present. Let's refine the definition: Boundaries = Unchanged colors adjacent to changed areas, excluding the identified background color.\n    *   Ex 2: BG=0 (White), Fill=4 (Yellow), Boundaries=[5 (Gray)] - Note: analysis code incorrectly includes fill=4. Correct boundaries = [5].\n    *   Ex 3: BG=7 (Orange), Fill=3 (Green), Boundaries=[6 (Magenta), 8 (Azure), 9 (Maroon)] - Note: analysis code incorrectly includes fill=3. Correct boundaries = [6, 8, 9].\n*   The `seed_locations` are correctly identified.\n*   The `identified_fill_type` heuristic (currently just checking if BG=0) correctly identifies 'left' for Example 2 and 'flood' for Examples 1 and 3. This simple heuristic might be sufficient for these examples, but feels brittle. A geometric analysis confirming the fill direction would be better. For Example 2, all filled pixels `(r, c)` where `input=0` and `output=4` are indeed to the left of the seed at `(4, 12)`.\n\n**3. YAML Facts (Updated)**\n\n"
