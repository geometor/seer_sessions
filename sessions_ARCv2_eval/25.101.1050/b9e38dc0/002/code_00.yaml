task_type: grid_transformation
transformation_type: conditional_fill
component_identification:
  method: input_output_comparison
  steps:
    - Compare input and output grids pixel by pixel.
    - Identify pixels that changed color.
    - background_color: The original color of the majority of pixels that changed color.
    - fill_color: The new color of the majority of pixels that changed color.
    - seed_pixels: Pixels in the input grid that have the `fill_color`.
    - boundary_colors: Colors of pixels that did *not* change color AND are adjacent (4-way) to pixels that *did* change color. (Exclude the background color itself from boundaries).
components:
  - role: background_color
    description: The color of pixels eligible to be filled. Identified by being the predominant original color in areas that change.
    examples:
      - train_1: 1 (blue)
      - train_2: 0 (white)
      - train_3: 7 (orange)
  - role: fill_color
    description: The color used to fill the background pixels. Identified by being the predominant new color in areas that change.
    examples:
      - train_1: 9 (maroon)
      - train_2: 4 (yellow)
      - train_3: 3 (green)
  - role: seed_pixels
    description: The initial pixel(s) with the 'fill_color' in the input grid that initiate the fill process.
    examples:
      - train_1: [(4, 8)]
      - train_2: [(4, 12)]
      - train_3: [(10, 9), (11, 7), (11, 8), (11, 9), (12, 7), (12, 8)]
  - role: boundary_colors
    description: Colors that block the fill operation. Identified as unchanged colors adjacent to changed pixels.
    examples:
      - train_1: [3 (green), 5 (gray)]
      - train_2: [5 (gray)]
      - train_3: [6 (magenta), 8 (azure), 9 (maroon)]
  - role: fill_mechanism
    description: The method by which the fill propagates from the seed(s). Determined by analyzing the pattern of change or potentially by properties of the background color.
    types:
      - flood_fill_4_way: Propagates up, down, left, right to adjacent background pixels. Stops at boundaries or grid edges. (e.g., train_1, train_3)
      - directional_fill_left: Propagates only leftwards to adjacent background pixels. Stops at boundaries or grid edges. (e.g., train_2 - correlated with background_color 0 in this task)
process_overview:
  - Identify background, fill, and boundary colors by comparing input and output grids.
  - Locate initial seed pixels (fill color) in the input.
  - Determine the appropriate fill mechanism (heuristic: use left-fill if background is white (0), otherwise use 4-way flood fill).
  - Execute the fill starting from seed locations (for flood fill) or based on proximity to fill-color pixels (for left fill), replacing background pixels with the fill color, respecting boundaries.
