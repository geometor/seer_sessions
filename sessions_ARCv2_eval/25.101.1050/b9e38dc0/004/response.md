**1. General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code execution failed on all training examples, indicating significant flaws in the initial approach. The primary issues were:

*   **Parameter Identification Heuristics:** The function `analyze_and_identify_params`, which relied solely on the input grid (color frequencies, adjacencies), failed to correctly identify the fill color in Example 3 and potentially contributed to incorrect behavior even when colors were seemingly identified correctly (due to brittleness).
*   **Flood Fill Implementation:** The `perform_flood_fill` function incorrectly filled colors other than the specified background color in Example 1, suggesting a bug in its neighbor-checking or update logic.
*   **Left Fill Implementation:** The `perform_left_fill` function failed to make any changes in Example 2, indicating a flaw in its propagation logic or conditions.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Adopt Input/Output Comparison for Parameter Identification:** The core logic must reliably determine the background, fill, and boundary colors. The `analyze_example` script demonstrated a successful approach using input/output comparison. This method (or one mimicking its deductions) should be the basis for parameter identification. The `analyze_and_identify_params` function based on input-only heuristics must be discarded or completely reworked.
2.  **Debug Fill Implementations:** The `perform_flood_fill` and `perform_left_fill` functions need careful debugging to ensure they strictly adhere to their intended logic:
    *   `perform_flood_fill`: Must only change pixels matching the `background_color`, starting from seeds, respecting connectivity.
    *   `perform_left_fill`: Must correctly and iteratively change `background_color` pixels to `fill_color` if their right neighbor is `fill_color`, until no more changes occur.
3.  **Refine Fill Type Determination:** While the simple heuristic (Background=0 -> Left Fill) worked for these examples, retain it cautiously, noting it might not generalize.

The focus will be on defining the transformation based on the *observed changes* between input and output, rather than potentially unreliable input-only heuristics.

**2. Metrics Gathering (Based on Input/Output Analysis)**

The `analyze_example` script from the previous turn provided accurate metrics by directly comparing inputs and outputs:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   `identified_background`: 1 (Blue)
    *   `identified_fill`: 9 (Maroon)
    *   `identified_boundaries`: [3 (Green), 5 (Gray)] (Corrected from script output)
    *   `seed_locations`: [(4, 8)]
    *   `identified_fill_type`: `flood`
    *   `changed_pixels`: 62 (All from Blue to Maroon)
*   **Example 2:**
    *   `identified_background`: 0 (White)
    *   `identified_fill`: 4 (Yellow)
    *   `identified_boundaries`: [5 (Gray)] (Corrected from script output)
    *   `seed_locations`: [(4, 12)]
    *   `identified_fill_type`: `left`
    *   `changed_pixels`: 72 (All from White to Yellow)
*   **Example 3:**
    *   `identified_background`: 7 (Orange)
    *   `identified_fill`: 3 (Green)
    *   `identified_boundaries`: [6 (Magenta), 8 (Azure), 9 (Maroon)] (Corrected from script output)
    *   `seed_locations`: [(10, 9), (11, 7), (11, 8), (11, 9), (12, 7), (12, 8)]
    *   `identified_fill_type`: `flood`
    *   `changed_pixels`: 43 (All from Orange to Green)

These metrics confirm the core parameters needed for the transformation. The key is to implement logic that can reliably derive these parameters and then apply the correct, debugged fill function.

**3. YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
transformation_type: conditional_fill
component_identification:
  method: input_output_comparison # Reliable identification requires observing input->output changes
  derived_properties:
    - background_color: The single color in the input that gets replaced by the fill_color in the output. Identified by finding the color with the highest count among input pixels at locations where the color changes.
    - fill_color: The single color that replaces the background_color. Identified by finding the color with the highest count among output pixels at locations where the color changes. Appears sparsely (as seeds) in the input.
    - seed_pixels: The coordinates of pixels in the input grid that have the 'fill_color'. These initiate the fill process.
    - boundary_colors: The set of colors present in the input grid that are neither the background_color nor the fill_color. These colors remain unchanged and block the fill's propagation.
    - fill_mechanism_type: The rule governing how the fill propagates. Determined by observing the pattern of change or properties of identified components.
      - If background_color is 0 (white), the mechanism is 'left_fill'.
      - Otherwise, the mechanism is 'flood_fill_4_way'.
components:
  - role: background_region
    property: color
    value: [Identified background_color: 1 (blue), 0 (white), or 7 (orange)]
    description: Pixels with this color are candidates for being filled.
  - role: fill_agent # The color acts like an agent spreading
    property: color
    value: [Identified fill_color: 9 (maroon), 4 (yellow), or 3 (green)]
    description: This color replaces the background color during the fill.
  - role: seed_points

    parameters:
      - grid: A copy of the input grid.
      - start_points: seed_pixels (used by flood_fill).
      - target_color: background_color (pixels to be changed).
      - replacement_color: fill_color.
    propagation:
      - flood_fill_4_way: From current fill_color pixels, change adjacent background_color pixels to fill_color. Repeat until no more changes.
      - left_fill: Iteratively scan the grid. If a pixel is background_color and the pixel to its right is fill_color, change the current pixel to fill_color. Repeat until no more changes in a pass.
    termination: Stop when propagation ceases or hits boundaries (grid edges or boundary_colors).
```


**4. Natural Language Program**

1.  **Analyze Input/Output:** Compare the input and output grids to definitively identify:
    *   The `background_color` (the single color being replaced).
    *   The `fill_color` (the single color doing the replacing).
    *   The `seed_pixels` (locations of the `fill_color` in the input).
    *   The `boundary_colors` (all other colors present, which remain unchanged and block the fill).
2.  **Determine Fill Type:** Check the identified `background_color`.
    *   If it is 0 (white), the fill method is **Left Fill**.
    *   Otherwise, the fill method is **Flood Fill (4-way)**.
3.  **Initialize Grid:** Create a modifiable copy of the input grid.
4.  **Execute Fill:** Apply the selected fill method to the copied grid:
    *   **If Flood Fill:**
        *   Initialize a queue with all `seed_pixels`.
        *   Maintain a set of `visited` coordinates, initially containing the `seed_pixels`.
        *   While the queue is not empty:
            *   Dequeue a coordinate `(r, c)`.
            *   For each valid 4-way neighbor `(nr, nc)`:
                *   If `(nr, nc)` has not been visited AND the color at `(nr, nc)` in the grid is the `background_color`:
                    *   Change the color of `(nr, nc)` to the `fill_color`.
                    *   Add `(nr, nc)` to the `visited` set.
                    *   Enqueue `(nr, nc)`.
    *   **If Left Fill:**
        *   Start a loop that continues as long as changes are made in a pass.
        *   Set a flag `changed_in_pass` to `False`.
        *   Iterate through the grid pixels (e.g., row by row, and for each row, from right-to-left, starting at the second column from the right). For each pixel `(r, c)`:
            *   If the color at `(r, c)` is the `background_color` AND the color at `(r, c+1)` (its right neighbor) is the `fill_color`:
                *   Change the color of `(r, c)` to the `fill_color`.
                *   Set `changed_in_pass` to `True`.
        *   If `changed_in_pass` is `False` after iterating through the whole grid, exit the loop.
5.  **Return Result:** Return the modified grid.
