            "text": "**1. General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code execution failed on all training examples, indicating significant flaws in the initial approach. The primary issues were:\n\n*   **Parameter Identification Heuristics:** The function `analyze_and_identify_params`, which relied solely on the input grid (color frequencies, adjacencies), failed to correctly identify the fill color in Example 3 and potentially contributed to incorrect behavior even when colors were seemingly identified correctly (due to brittleness).\n*   **Flood Fill Implementation:** The `perform_flood_fill` function incorrectly filled colors other than the specified background color in Example 1, suggesting a bug in its neighbor-checking or update logic.\n*   **Left Fill Implementation:** The `perform_left_fill` function failed to make any changes in Example 2, indicating a flaw in its propagation logic or conditions.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Adopt Input/Output Comparison for Parameter Identification:** The core logic must reliably determine the background, fill, and boundary colors. The `analyze_example` script demonstrated a successful approach using input/output comparison. This method (or one mimicking its deductions) should be the basis for parameter identification. The `analyze_and_identify_params` function based on input-only heuristics must be discarded or completely reworked.\n2.  **Debug Fill Implementations:** The `perform_flood_fill` and `perform_left_fill` functions need careful debugging to ensure they strictly adhere to their intended logic:\n    *   `perform_flood_fill`: Must only change pixels matching the `background_color`, starting from seeds, respecting connectivity.\n    *   `perform_left_fill`: Must correctly and iteratively change `background_color` pixels to `fill_color` if their right neighbor is `fill_color`, until no more changes occur.\n3.  **Refine Fill Type Determination:** While the simple heuristic (Background=0 -> Left Fill) worked for these examples, retain it cautiously, noting it might not generalize.\n\nThe focus will be on defining the transformation based on the *observed changes* between input and output, rather than potentially unreliable input-only heuristics.\n\n**2. Metrics Gathering (Based on Input/Output Analysis)**\n\nThe `analyze_example` script from the previous turn provided accurate metrics by directly comparing inputs and outputs:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   `identified_background`: 1 (Blue)\n    *   `identified_fill`: 9 (Maroon)\n    *   `identified_boundaries`: [3 (Green), 5 (Gray)] (Corrected from script output)\n    *   `seed_locations`: [(4, 8)]\n    *   `identified_fill_type`: `flood`\n    *   `changed_pixels`: 62 (All from Blue to Maroon)\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   `identified_background`: 0 (White)\n    *   `identified_fill`: 4 (Yellow)\n    *   `identified_boundaries`: [5 (Gray)] (Corrected from script output)\n    *   `seed_locations`: [(4, 12)]\n    *   `identified_fill_type`: `left`\n    *   `changed_pixels`: 72 (All from White to Yellow)\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   `identified_background`: 7 (Orange)\n    *   `identified_fill`: 3 (Green)\n    *   `identified_boundaries`: [6 (Magenta), 8 (Azure), 9 (Maroon)] (Corrected from script output)\n    *   `seed_locations`: [(10, 9), (11, 7), (11, 8), (11, 9), (12, 7), (12, 8)]\n    *   `identified_fill_type`: `flood`\n    *   `changed_pixels`: 43 (All from Orange to Green)\n\nThese metrics confirm the core parameters needed for the transformation. The key is to implement logic that can reliably derive these parameters and then apply the correct, debugged fill function.\n\n**3. YAML Facts**\n\n"
