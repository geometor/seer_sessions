**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous analysis correctly identified the core conditional logic based on the presence or absence of a 3x3 red (2) block. However, the specific transformation rules within each branch were inaccurate, leading to failures on examples 2 and 3.

*   **Branch 1 (3x3 Red Exists - Example 3):** The error analysis reveals that the transformation involves locating a 3x3 white (0) block in the input and using its position to determine where a 3x3 white (0) block should appear in the output, relative to the input position. Specifically, if the input white block is at (Wr, Wc), the output white block appears at (Wr-6, Wc+6). The base transformation in this branch is white(0) -> blue(1), with reds(2) remaining unchanged. The calculated output white block overwrites any pixels at the target location.
*   **Branch 2 (No 3x3 Red Exists - Examples 1, 2, 4):** Examples 1 and 4 are correctly solved by the simple rule: white(0) -> blue(1) and red(2) -> white(0). Example 2 remains an anomaly, as the expected output includes an additional transformation of a 2x2 blue(1) block to white(0) at coordinates (7,8)-(8,9), which is not explained by the simple rule or any obvious secondary trigger consistent with Examples 1 and 4.

**Strategy:**

1.  Refine the code for Branch 1 to implement the relative positioning logic based on the input 3x3 white block's location. Add error handling or a default behavior if no 3x3 white block is found in the input (though this case isn't demonstrated).
2.  Maintain the simple rule (0->1, 2->0) for Branch 2, as it correctly solves 2 out of 3 examples in this category.
3.  Explicitly document the unexplained behavior in Example 2 within the analysis and potentially as a comment in the code.
4.  Regenerate metrics using the previous analysis results to confirm the observed color changes and block presences.
5.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the refined understanding.

**Metrics and Analysis (Based on previous `code_execution` results)**

*   **Example 1 (No 3x3 Red):**
    *   Input Shape: (12, 12)
    *   Input Blocks: Has 3x3 Blue. No 3x3 Red/White.
    *   Expected Changes: `red(2) -> white(0)` (4), `white(0) -> blue(1)` (4)
    *   Status: Correctly solved by rule 0->1, 2->0.
*   **Example 2 (No 3x3 Red):**
    *   Input Shape: (14, 14)
    *   Input Blocks: No 3x3 Red/White/Blue. (Analysis shows 2x2 Red exists).
    *   Expected Changes: `white(0) -> blue(1)` (4), `red(2) -> white(0)` (4), `blue(1) -> white(0)` (4 at (7,8)-(8,9))
    *   Status: Rule 0->1, 2->0 is incomplete. The blue->white change is unexplained by the general rule for this branch.
*   **Example 3 (Has 3x3 Red):**
    *   Input Shape: (16, 16)
    *   Input Blocks: Has 3x3 Red (at 1,0). Has 3x3 White (at 12,1). Has 3x3 Blue (at 8,8).
    *   Expected Changes: `white(0) -> blue(1)` (9), `blue(1) -> white(0)` (9 at (6,7)-(8,9))
    *   Status: Rule needs refinement. New hypothesis: Locate input 3x3 White block at (Wr, Wc), perform 0->1 change, then create output 3x3 White block at (Wr-6, Wc+6).
*   **Example 4 (No 3x3 Red):**
    *   Input Shape: (10, 10)
    *   Input Blocks: No 3x3 blocks.
    *   Expected Changes: `white(0) -> blue(1)` (1), `red(2) -> white(0)` (1)
    *   Status: Correctly solved by rule 0->1, 2->0.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to determine if a 3x3 block composed entirely of red (2) pixels exists.
3.  **If a 3x3 red block exists:**
    a.  Scan the input grid to find the top-left coordinate (Wr, Wc) of the first occurrence of a 3x3 block composed entirely of white (0) pixels.
    b.  If no such 3x3 white block is found, proceed to step 4 (return the initial copy, effectively no change - *assumption based on lack of examples*).
    c.  If a 3x3 white block is found at (Wr, Wc):
        i.  Iterate through all cells (r, c) of the input grid. If `input[r, c]` is white (0), set `output[r, c]` to blue (1). (Leave red(2), blue(1), green(3) pixels unchanged in this initial pass).
        ii. Calculate the target top-left coordinate for the output white block: `Tr = Wr - 6`, `Tc = Wc + 6`.
        iii. Check if the target coordinates `(Tr, Tc)` and the resulting 3x3 block `(Tr:Tr+3, Tc:Tc+3)` are within the grid boundaries.
        iv. If the target block is within bounds, change all pixels in the output grid within the 3x3 area starting at `(Tr, Tc)` to white (0), overwriting any previous values in that area.
4.  **If no 3x3 red block exists:**
    a.  Iterate through all cells (r, c) of the input grid:
        i.  If `input[r, c]` is white (0), set `output[r, c]` to blue (1).
        ii. If `input[r, c]` is red (2), set `output[r, c]` to white (0).
        iii. If `input[r, c]` is blue (1) or green (3), keep the original color (`output[r, c] = input[r, c]`).
    b.  *(Note: This rule successfully transforms examples 1 and 4, but does not account for the specific blue-to-white 2x2 block change observed only in training example 2's expected output).*
5.  Return the final modified output grid.
