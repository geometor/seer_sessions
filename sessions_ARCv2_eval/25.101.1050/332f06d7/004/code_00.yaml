    type: block
    shape: 3x3
    color: white(0)
    role: Its location determines the location of a transformation in the output.

    example: train_2
    description: A 2x2 block of blue(1) pixels at (7,8)-(8,9) changes to white(0). This transformation is not covered by the general rule for this branch and its trigger is currently unknown.
