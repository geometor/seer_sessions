The transformation rule appears to depend on the presence and configuration of red (2) pixels. Specifically, the presence or absence of a 3x3 square block composed entirely of red pixels dictates how other colors change.\n\n1.  **Conditional Logic:** There seem to be two main modes of operation. The trigger condition is whether a 3x3 block of red (2) pixels exists anywhere in the input grid.\n2.  **Color Swaps:**\n    *   White (0) pixels consistently change to blue (1) pixels in all examples.\n    *   Red (2) pixels either change to white (0) or remain unchanged, depending on the trigger condition.\n    *   Blue (1) pixels either remain unchanged or, under specific conditions (related to the trigger), certain configurations of blue pixels (specifically 3x3 blocks) change to white (0).\n3.  **Key Objects:** The primary objects are individual pixels identified by their color and location. A significant derived object is the \"3x3 block\" of a single color (specifically red and blue).\n4.  **Background:** Green (3) pixels seem to act as a background or frame color and are generally unaffected by the transformation rules, except when they are part of the objects being transformed (which doesn't happen in these examples).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
