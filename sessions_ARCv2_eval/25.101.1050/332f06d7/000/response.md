Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of the elements:**

The task involves transforming input grids containing pixels of different colors: green (3), red (2), blue (1), and white (0). The transformation rule appears to depend on the presence and configuration of red (2) pixels. Specifically, the presence or absence of a 3x3 square block composed entirely of red pixels dictates how other colors change.

1.  **Conditional Logic:** There seem to be two main modes of operation. The trigger condition is whether a 3x3 block of red (2) pixels exists anywhere in the input grid.
2.  **Color Swaps:**
    *   White (0) pixels consistently change to blue (1) pixels in all examples.
    *   Red (2) pixels either change to white (0) or remain unchanged, depending on the trigger condition.
    *   Blue (1) pixels either remain unchanged or, under specific conditions (related to the trigger), certain configurations of blue pixels (specifically 3x3 blocks) change to white (0).
3.  **Key Objects:** The primary objects are individual pixels identified by their color and location. A significant derived object is the "3x3 block" of a single color (specifically red and blue).
4.  **Background:** Green (3) pixels seem to act as a background or frame color and are generally unaffected by the transformation rules, except when they are part of the objects being transformed (which doesn't happen in these examples).

**YAML Facts:**

branch_2:
  condition: A 3x3 block of red(2) pixels DOES NOT EXIST in the input grid.
  actions:
    - object: all white(0) pixels
      action: change_color
      to_color: blue(1)
    - object: all red(2) pixels

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input grid to determine if there is any 3x3 square block composed entirely of red (2) pixels.
2.  **If a 3x3 red block exists:**
    a.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
    b.  Change all white (0) pixels in the output grid to blue (1).
    c.  Identify all 3x3 square blocks composed entirely of blue (1) pixels in the output grid. Change all pixels within these 3x3 blue blocks to white (0).
    d.  Leave all red (2) and green (3) pixels unchanged (unless they were part of a 3x3 blue block identified in step 2c, which is unlikely based on examples but possible).
3.  **If no 3x3 red block exists:**
    a.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
    b.  Change all white (0) pixels in the output grid to blue (1).
    c.  Change all red (2) pixels in the output grid to white (0).
    d.  Leave all blue (1) and green (3) pixels unchanged.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
