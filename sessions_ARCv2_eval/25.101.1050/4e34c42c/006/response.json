            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code failed because the logic for determining the extracted slice's rows and columns was incorrect. It attempted to use the marker's minimum row (`m_min_r`) for the rows and the pattern's columns (`p_min_c`, `p_max_c`) for the columns. While this worked partially for Example 1, it failed completely for Example 2 and didn't even capture Example 1 perfectly.\n\nAnalysis revealed inconsistencies in how the slice parameters related to the marker (`m_min_r`) versus the pattern (`p_min_r`, `p_min_c`, `p_max_c`) across the examples.\n\nA new hypothesis (Hypothesis v4) was developed based on combining the marker and its adjacent pattern(s) into a single \"object\" and using that object's bounding box.\n\n**Hypothesis v4 (Object BBox):**\n1.  Identify Background (`BKG`) and Marker (`M`) colors.\n2.  Find components for Markers (`M_comp`) and Patterns (`P_comp`, non-BKG, non-M, size > 5).\n3.  For each valid Pattern component `P`:\n    a. Find all Marker components `M_adj` that are adjacent (8-way) to `P`.\n    b. If `M_adj` is not empty:\n        i.  Determine the primary `trigger_m_min_r = min(m.min_row for m in M_adj)`.\n        ii. Combine coordinates: `O_coords = P.coords U (coords of all m in M_adj)`.\n        iii. Calculate the bounding box of these combined coordinates: `(o_min_r, o_min_c, o_max_r, o_max_c)`.\n        iv. Store the unique tuple `(trigger_m_min_r, o_min_r, o_min_c, o_max_c)`.\n4.  Extract slices: For each unique tuple, the slice is `input[o_min_r : o_min_r+5, o_min_c : o_max_c+1]` (handling grid boundaries).\n5.  Sort the extracted slices based on `trigger_m_min_r` descending.\n6.  Pad slices to height 5 using `BKG` color.\n7.  Concatenate horizontally.\n\nThis hypothesis successfully explains the transformation for both Example 1 and Example 2.\n\n**Strategy:**\nImplement the transformation logic based on Hypothesis v4. This requires functions for component finding, property extraction (including coordinates and bounding boxes), adjacency checking, coordinate merging, and careful handling of the association and extraction steps. The marker identification heuristic remains simple (M=9 if BKG=8, M=8 if BKG=4).\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   BKG=8, M=9.\n    *   Pattern P_blob (rows 7-10, cols 7-15, size 41). Adjacent Marker M1 (rows 6,10, col 6, `m_min_r=6`). Combined Object O1 BBox: (6, 6, 10, 15).\n    *   Pattern P_bar (rows 11-15, cols 20-22, size 15). Adjacent Marker M2 (rows 11,15, col 22, `m_min_r=11`). Combined Object O2 BBox: (11, 20, 15, 22).\n    *   Associations stored: `(trigger=6, o_r=6, o_c_min=6, o_c_max=15)` and `(trigger=11, o_r=11, o_c_min=20, o_c_max=22)`.\n    *   Slices extracted: `S1 = input[11:16, 20:23]` (from trigger=11), `S2 = input[6:11, 6:16]` (from trigger=6).\n    *   Order: S1 then S2. Output: `hstack(S1, S2)`. Matches expected output.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   BKG=4, M=8.\n    *   Pattern P_top (rows 1-5, cols 11-17, size 28). Adjacent Marker M1 (rows 2-4, col 10, `m_min_r=2`). Combined Object O1 BBox: (1, 10, 5, 17).\n    *   Pattern P_bottom (rows 23-27, cols 2-7, size 39). Adjacent Marker M2 (rows 24-26, col 7, `m_min_r=24`). Combined Object O2 BBox: (23, 2, 27, 7).\n    *   Associations stored: `(trigger=2, o_r=1, o_c_min=10, o_c_max=17)` and `(trigger=24, o_r=23, o_c_min=2, o_c_max=7)`.\n    *   Slices extracted: `S1 = input[23:28, 2:8]` (from trigger=24), `S2 = input[1:6, 10:18]` (from trigger=2).\n    *   Order: S1 then S2. Output: `hstack(S1, S2)`. Matches expected output.\n\n**YAML Block**\n\n"
