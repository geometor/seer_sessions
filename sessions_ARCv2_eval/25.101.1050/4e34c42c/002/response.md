**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code failed because it hardcoded the marker color to maroon (9) and potentially used an incorrect method to determine the column boundaries of the extracted slices. The failure on Example 1 (incorrect width and marker inclusion) and Example 2 (producing only a single pixel) indicates the logic needs significant refinement.

The core idea of identifying marker-associated regions, extracting fixed-height (5 rows) slices starting from the marker's minimum row, ordering these slices by descending minimum row, and concatenating them horizontally seems plausible.

The key challenges are:
1.  **Marker Identification:** The marker color is not constant (maroon 9 in Ex1, possibly azure 8 in Ex2). A robust method is needed to identify the marker color(s) based on properties like adjacency to other patterns, component size/shape, or frequency. A potential heuristic is to identify colors whose components are *only* adjacent to other non-background patterns, rather than being internal parts of them.
2.  **Column Definition:** Determining the exact start and end columns for each 5-row slice is crucial. The analysis suggests a rule based on the marker's position relative to the associated pattern's bounding box:
    *   If the marker is strictly to the left of the pattern, extract only the pattern columns.
    *   If the marker overlaps, is inside, or is to the right of the pattern, extract columns covering both the pattern and the marker.
3.  **Handling Multiple Markers/Patterns:** The code must correctly associate each marker component with its corresponding pattern region and handle cases with multiple markers triggering extractions.

**Strategy:**
1.  Implement a function to determine the background color (most frequent).
2.  Implement a function to identify the marker color(s). Start with the heuristic: find colors `c != bkg` where all components of `c` are adjacent (8-connectivity) to some non-`c`, non-`bkg` pixel. If multiple candidates, maybe choose the one with the smallest components or lowest frequency. For now, we might need to assume Marker=9 for Ex1 and Marker=8 for Ex2 based on observation.
3.  Refine the extraction logic based on the "Revised Rule (v3)" outlined in the thought block: Find marker components, determine 5-row slice based on min row, find pattern-only bounding box, find marker bounding box, determine final columns based on relative position (marker-left vs marker-overlap/right), extract, sort by min row descending, concatenate.
4.  Use `tool_code` to verify colors and component properties for each example.
