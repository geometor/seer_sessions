            "text": "**Perception**\n\nThe task involves identifying specific patterns or objects within a larger input grid and assembling them into a smaller output grid. The input grid consists of a dominant background color and several smaller, distinct shapes made of various colors. Certain pixels, distinguished by their color (maroon in the first example, potentially gray or azure in the second), seem to act as \"markers.\" These markers appear to signal which patterns should be extracted and possibly how they should be processed or arranged.\n\nThe transformation appears to consist of the following steps:\n1.  **Identification:** Locate the marker pixels within the input grid.\n2.  **Region Definition:** For each marker (or group of connected markers), define a specific 5-row high rectangular region (a \"slice\") of the input grid. The definition of this slice (its starting column and width) seems to depend on the position of the marker(s) relative to the associated non-background pattern (e.g., is the marker adjacent to the left, or contained within?).\n3.  **Extraction:** Extract these 5xN slices from the input grid.\n4.  **Ordering:** Arrange the extracted slices horizontally. The ordering appears to be based on the vertical position (row index) of the corresponding markers in the input grid, specifically in descending order of the minimum row index of the marker(s).\n5.  **Concatenation:** Combine the ordered slices horizontally to form the final output grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

The columns depend on the marker's position relative to the nearby non-background pattern:\n        i.  If the marker is located just to the left of the pattern (like marker (6,6) relative to pattern starting at column 7 in train_1), the columns start one position to the right of the marker's column and extend to cover the width of the adjacent pattern.\n        ii. If the marker(s) are part of or on the edge of the pattern (like markers at column 22 relative to pattern in columns 20-22 in train_1), the columns cover the horizontal extent of the pattern including the markers.\n    c.  Extract this 5xN rectangular region.\n4.  Collect all extracted regions.\n5.
