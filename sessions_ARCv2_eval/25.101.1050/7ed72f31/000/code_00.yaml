Task: Complete symmetry for objects containing a red element.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Background_Color: The most frequent color in the input grid (blue=1 in train_1, azure=8 in train_2).
  - Objects: Connected components of non-background pixels.
    - Type_1: Single-color objects.
    - Type_2: Two-color objects, specifically containing red (2) pixels and pixels of exactly one other color (C).

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input, potentially modified.
  - Background_Color: Same as input.
  - Objects:
    - Type_1 objects: Unchanged from input.
    - Type_2 objects: Potentially expanded by adding pixels of color C based on symmetry rules.

Transformation_Rules:
  - Identify Type_2 objects (Red + Color C).
  - For each Type_2 object:
    - Analyze the geometry of the red pixels:
      - If red pixels form a line L (horizontal or vertical, length > 1):
        - Action: Reflect C pixels across line L.
        - Result: Add reflected C pixels to the grid where the target cell is background color.
      - If red pixel is a single point P:
        - Check adjacency of C pixels to P:
          - If C adjacent only horizontally: Reflect C pixels across vertical line through P. Add reflected C pixels.
          - If C adjacent only vertically: Reflect C pixels across horizontal line through P. Add reflected C pixels.
          - If C adjacent horizontally and vertically: Reflect C pixels via point symmetry around P. Add reflected C pixels.
  - Anomaly: train_1 Azure/Red object transformation doesn't fully match these rules, suggesting a possible edge case or refinement needed.

Relationships:
  - Red pixels act as the axis or center of symmetry.
  - The non-red color (C) within the object is the color being reflected/added.
  - Symmetry completion occurs relative to the red element.
