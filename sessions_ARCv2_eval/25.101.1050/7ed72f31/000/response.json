            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided training examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels. The grid size remains the same (18x18 for both examples).\n2.  **Background Color:** The background color (blue=1 in train\\_1, azure=8 in train\\_2) remains unchanged.\n3.  **Objects:** The grids contain distinct objects, which are connected components of non-background colors. Some objects are composed of a single color (e.g., the green object in train\\_1), while others are composed of two colors, specifically red (2) and one other color (e.g., yellow/red, gray/red, azure/red in train\\_1; yellow/red, blue/red, green/red in train\\_2).\n4.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation modifies only the objects composed of red and one other color. Single-color objects (like the green one in train\\_1) and the background are untouched.\n5.  **Core Action - Symmetry/Reflection:** The modification appears to involve adding pixels to complete a symmetry based on the red pixels within the object.\n    *   **Red Line Axis:** When the red pixels within an object form a straight line (horizontal or vertical, length > 1), the non-red pixels (color C) of that object are reflected across this line. The reflected pixels of color C are added to the grid if they land on a background pixel. (Seen in T1 Yellow/Red, T2 Red/Yellow, T2 Red/Green).\n    *   **Red Point Center/Axis:** When the red component is a single pixel P, the transformation depends on how the other color C is connected to P.\n        *   If color C pixels are adjacent to P only horizontally (left/right), reflection occurs across the vertical line passing through P. (Seen in T2 Red/Blue).\n        *   If color C pixels are adjacent to P only vertically (up/down), reflection occurs across the horizontal line passing through P. (Not explicitly seen, but inferred by symmetry).\n        *   If color C pixels are adjacent to P both horizontally and vertically, point reflection seems to occur around P. (Seen in T1 Gray/Red, although one expected pixel was missing in the output, possibly due to an overlay or specific condition).\n6.  **Anomaly:** In train\\_1, the Azure/Red object has a horizontal red line. The existing Azure pixels are already symmetric across this line. Simple reflection adds no new pixels. However, the output shows an additional Azure pixel at (17, 13), which doesn't directly fit the reflection/symmetry completion pattern observed in other cases. This might indicate a special case or a nuance not fully captured yet.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

If the red pixels R form a straight horizontal or vertical line of length 2 or more: Define this line as the Axis A. For each coordinate `p` in C\\_coords, calculate the reflected coordinate `p'` by reflecting `p` across Axis A. If the pixel at `p'` in the output grid is the background color, change its color to C.\n        ii. If the red pixels R consist of a single point P:\n            1. Check the coordinates adjacent (North, South, East, West) to P.\n            2. Let `adj_H` be true if any C pixel is horizontally adjacent (East/West) to P.\n            3. Let `adj_V` be true if any C pixel is vertically adjacent (North/South) to P.\n            4. If `adj_H` is true and `adj_V` is false: Define Axis A as the vertical line passing through P.

If `adj_V` is true and `adj_H` is false: Define Axis A as the horizontal line passing through P. For each coordinate `p` in C\\_coords, calculate the reflected coordinate `p'` by reflecting `p` across Axis A. If the pixel at `p'` in the output grid is the background color, change its color to C.\n            6. Otherwise (if `adj_H` and `adj_V` are both true, or potentially if C pixels are only diagonally adjacent - covering the T1 Gray/Red case): For each coordinate `p` in C\\_coords, calculate the point-reflected coordinate `p'` relative to P. If the pixel at `p'` in the output grid is the background color, change its color to C.\n7.  Return the final output grid.\n*(Note: This program attempts to generalize the observed patterns but may need refinement based on the anomalous behavior in train_1's Azure/Red object or if the T1 Gray/Red point reflection has a specific exclusion rule not yet identified).*"
