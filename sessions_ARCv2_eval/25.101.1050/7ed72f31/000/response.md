Okay, let's analyze the provided training examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels. The grid size remains the same (18x18 for both examples).
2.  **Background Color:** The background color (blue=1 in train\_1, azure=8 in train\_2) remains unchanged.
3.  **Objects:** The grids contain distinct objects, which are connected components of non-background colors. Some objects are composed of a single color (e.g., the green object in train\_1), while others are composed of two colors, specifically red (2) and one other color (e.g., yellow/red, gray/red, azure/red in train\_1; yellow/red, blue/red, green/red in train\_2).
4.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation modifies only the objects composed of red and one other color. Single-color objects (like the green one in train\_1) and the background are untouched.
5.  **Core Action - Symmetry/Reflection:** The modification appears to involve adding pixels to complete a symmetry based on the red pixels within the object.
    *   **Red Line Axis:** When the red pixels within an object form a straight line (horizontal or vertical, length > 1), the non-red pixels (color C) of that object are reflected across this line. The reflected pixels of color C are added to the grid if they land on a background pixel. (Seen in T1 Yellow/Red, T2 Red/Yellow, T2 Red/Green).
    *   **Red Point Center/Axis:** When the red component is a single pixel P, the transformation depends on how the other color C is connected to P.
        *   If color C pixels are adjacent to P only horizontally (left/right), reflection occurs across the vertical line passing through P. (Seen in T2 Red/Blue).
        *   If color C pixels are adjacent to P only vertically (up/down), reflection occurs across the horizontal line passing through P. (Not explicitly seen, but inferred by symmetry).
        *   If color C pixels are adjacent to P both horizontally and vertically, point reflection seems to occur around P. (Seen in T1 Gray/Red, although one expected pixel was missing in the output, possibly due to an overlay or specific condition).
6.  **Anomaly:** In train\_1, the Azure/Red object has a horizontal red line. The existing Azure pixels are already symmetric across this line. Simple reflection adds no new pixels. However, the output shows an additional Azure pixel at (17, 13), which doesn't directly fit the reflection/symmetry completion pattern observed in other cases. This might indicate a special case or a nuance not fully captured yet.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Complete symmetry for objects containing a red element.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Background_Color: The most frequent color in the input grid (blue=1 in train_1, azure=8 in train_2).
  - Objects: Connected components of non-background pixels.
    - Type_1: Single-color objects.
    - Type_2: Two-color objects, specifically containing red (2) pixels and pixels of exactly one other color (C).

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input, potentially modified.
  - Background_Color: Same as input.
  - Objects:
    - Type_1 objects: Unchanged from input.
    - Type_2 objects: Potentially expanded by adding pixels of color C based on symmetry rules.

Transformation_Rules:
  - Identify Type_2 objects (Red + Color C).
  - For each Type_2 object:
    - Analyze the geometry of the red pixels:
      - If red pixels form a line L (horizontal or vertical, length > 1):
        - Action: Reflect C pixels across line L.
        - Result: Add reflected C pixels to the grid where the target cell is background color.
      - If red pixel is a single point P:
        - Check adjacency of C pixels to P:
          - If C adjacent only horizontally: Reflect C pixels across vertical line through P. Add reflected C pixels.
          - If C adjacent only vertically: Reflect C pixels across horizontal line through P. Add reflected C pixels.
          - If C adjacent horizontally and vertically: Reflect C pixels via point symmetry around P. Add reflected C pixels.
  - Anomaly: train_1 Azure/Red object transformation doesn't fully match these rules, suggesting a possible edge case or refinement needed.

Relationships:
  - Red pixels act as the axis or center of symmetry.
  - The non-red color (C) within the object is the color being reflected/added.
  - Symmetry completion occurs relative to the red element.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the background color (the most frequent color in the input grid).
3.  Find all connected components (objects) in the input grid that consist of non-background colors.
4.  For each object found:
5.  Check if the object contains red (color 2) pixels and pixels of exactly one other color (let this be color C).
6.  If the object meets the condition in step 5:
    a.  Extract the coordinates of the red pixels (R) and the C-colored pixels (C\_coords).
    b.  **Determine Symmetry Type based on Red Pixels:**
        i.  If the red pixels R form a straight horizontal or vertical line of length 2 or more: Define this line as the Axis A. For each coordinate `p` in C\_coords, calculate the reflected coordinate `p'` by reflecting `p` across Axis A. If the pixel at `p'` in the output grid is the background color, change its color to C.
        ii. If the red pixels R consist of a single point P:
            1. Check the coordinates adjacent (North, South, East, West) to P.
            2. Let `adj_H` be true if any C pixel is horizontally adjacent (East/West) to P.
            3. Let `adj_V` be true if any C pixel is vertically adjacent (North/South) to P.
            4. If `adj_H` is true and `adj_V` is false: Define Axis A as the vertical line passing through P. For each coordinate `p` in C\_coords, calculate the reflected coordinate `p'` by reflecting `p` across Axis A. If the pixel at `p'` in the output grid is the background color, change its color to C.
            5. If `adj_V` is true and `adj_H` is false: Define Axis A as the horizontal line passing through P. For each coordinate `p` in C\_coords, calculate the reflected coordinate `p'` by reflecting `p` across Axis A. If the pixel at `p'` in the output grid is the background color, change its color to C.
            6. Otherwise (if `adj_H` and `adj_V` are both true, or potentially if C pixels are only diagonally adjacent - covering the T1 Gray/Red case): For each coordinate `p` in C\_coords, calculate the point-reflected coordinate `p'` relative to P. If the pixel at `p'` in the output grid is the background color, change its color to C.
7.  Return the final output grid.
*(Note: This program attempts to generalize the observed patterns but may need refinement based on the anomalous behavior in train_1's Azure/Red object or if the T1 Gray/Red point reflection has a specific exclusion rule not yet identified).*
