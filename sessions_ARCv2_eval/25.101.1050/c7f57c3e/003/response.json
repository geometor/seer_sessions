Swap Case:\n   - Condition: If both Green(3) and Azure(8) Bases are found associated with any Upper Structures.\n   - Actions:\n     - Green(3) Bases are changed entirely to Azure(8).\n     - Azure(8) Bases are changed entirely to Green(3).\n     - If an Upper Structure was associated with a Green(3) Base, all Red(2) pixels within that structure are changed to Azure(8).\n     - If an Upper Structure was associated with an Azure(8) Base, any pixel *within that Base* located directly below a Red(2) pixel of the structure is changed to Red(2) (overriding the Base swap for that specific pixel).\n\n2. Trigger Case:\n   - Condition: If the Swap Case condition is not met, AND at least one isolated Trigger Pixel exists (single non-background, non-structure/base pixel not adjacent to a structure).\n   - Assumption: All Trigger Pixels share the same color ('TargetColor').\n   - Actions:\n     - All identified Bases (regardless of original color) are changed entirely to the TargetColor.\n     - All Trigger Pixels are changed to the BackgroundColor.\n\n3. No Action:\n   - Condition: If neither the Swap Case nor the Trigger Case conditions are met.\n   - Action: The grid remains unchanged.\n\nHelper concepts:\n- BackgroundColor: Most frequent color in the grid.\n- Adjacency: Includes diagonals (8-way connectivity).\n- Base Association: A Base is associated if it's adjacent to an Upper Structure and its top is not above the structure's top.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid: np.ndarray, background_color: int) -> list[tuple[int, set[tuple[int, int]]]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds connected components (objects) of non-background colors using BFS.\n    Returns a list of tuples: (color, set_of_pixel_coordinates).\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if not visited[r, c] and grid[r, c] != background_color:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                obj_pixels = set()\n                q = [(r, c)]\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                current_obj_visited_in_bfs = set([(r,c)]) # Track visited for *this specific object's BFS*\n\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.pop(0)\n                    \n                    # Ensure we only add pixels matching the initial color of this object\n                    if grid[row, col] == color:\n                        obj_pixels.add((row, col))\n                        \n                        # Explore neighbors (8-connectivity for object finding)\n                        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                                    continue\n                                nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                                   not visited[nr, nc] and \\\n                                   grid[nr, nc] == color and \\\n                                   (nr, nc) not in current_obj_visited_in_bfs:\n                                    visited[nr, nc] = True\n                                    current_obj_visited_in_bfs.add((nr,nc))\n                                    q.append((nr, nc))\n                    # Mark non-matching color pixels as visited globally \n                    # to avoid starting new searches from them, but don't add to current object\n                    elif 0 <= row < rows and 0 <= col < cols :\n                         visited[row,col] = True\n\n                if obj_pixels:\n                    objects.append((color, obj_pixels))\n            # Ensure even background or already-processed pixels are marked visited\n            visited[r,c] = True \n    return objects\n\ndef get_bounding_box(pixels: set[tuple[int, int]]) -> tuple[int, int, int, int]:\n    \"\"\"Calculates the min/max row/col for a set of pixels.\"\"\"\n    if not pixels:\n        return 0, 0, 0, 0\n    min_r = min(r for r, c in pixels)\n    max_r = max(r for r, c in pixels)\n    min_c = min(c for r, c in pixels)\n    max_c = max(c for r, c in pixels)\n    return min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c\n\ndef check_adjacency(pixels1: set[tuple[int, int]], pixels2: set[tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Checks if any pixel in pixels1 is adjacent (8-way) to any pixel in pixels2.\"\"\"\n    for r1, c1 in pixels1:\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                    continue\n                nr, nc = r1 + dr, c1 + dc\n                if (nr, nc) in pixels2:\n                    return True\n    return False\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation logic based on Upper Structures, Bases, and Trigger Pixels.\n    \"\"\"\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_grid = grid.copy()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    # 1.
