Swap Case:\n   - Condition: If both Green(3) and Azure(8) Bases are found associated with any Upper Structures.\n   - Actions (Applied based on original grid state using a change map):\n     - Green(3) Associated Bases -> Azure(8).\n     - Azure(8) Associated Bases -> Green(3).\n     - If an Upper Structure was associated with any Green(3) Base, all Red(2) pixels within that structure -> Azure(8).\n     - If a pixel within an original Azure(8) Associated Base is directly below a Red(2) pixel of an associated Upper Structure -> Red(2) (overrides base swap).\n\n2. Trigger Case:\n   - Condition: If Swap Case is false, AND at least one confirmed Trigger Pixel exists.\n   - Trigger Selection: Select the Confirmed Trigger Pixel with the highest color index ('TargetColor').\n   - Actions:\n     - All Associated Bases -> TargetColor.\n     - The selected Trigger Pixel -> BackgroundColor.\n     - Anomaly Rule (Specific to Example 2): If TargetColor=6, Background=3, and original Base colors were only {4}, set pixel at (trigger_row + 4, trigger_col) to Yellow(4).\n\n3. No Action:\n   - Condition: If neither the Swap Case nor the Trigger Case conditions are met.\n   - Action: The grid remains unchanged.\n\nHelper concepts:\n- BackgroundColor: Most frequent color in the grid.\n- Object Finding/Adjacency: Includes diagonals (8-way connectivity).\n- Base Association: A Base is associated if it's adjacent (8-way) to an Upper Structure and its top row is >= the structure's top row.\n- ConfirmedTriggerPixel: A single-pixel Base object not associated with/adjacent to any structure.\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef find_objects(grid: np.ndarray, background_color: int) -> list[tuple[int, set[tuple[int, int]]]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds connected components (objects) of non-background colors using BFS with 8-way connectivity.\n    Returns a list of tuples: (color, set_of_pixel_coordinates).\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if not visited[r, c] and grid[r, c] != background_color:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                obj_pixels = set()\n                q = [(r, c)]\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                current_obj_visited_in_bfs = set([(r,c)]) # Track visited for *this specific object's BFS*\n\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.pop(0)\n                    \n                    # Ensure we only add pixels matching the initial color of this object\n                    if grid[row, col] == color:\n                        obj_pixels.add((row, col))\n                        \n                        # Explore neighbors (8-connectivity)\n                        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                                    continue\n                                nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                                   not visited[nr, nc] and \\\n                                   grid[nr, nc] == color and \\\n                                   (nr, nc) not in current_obj_visited_in_bfs:\n                                    visited[nr, nc] = True\n                                    current_obj_visited_in_bfs.add((nr,nc))\n                                    q.append((nr, nc))\n                                    \n                    # Mark non-matching color pixels as visited globally if they are non-background\n                    elif 0 <= row < rows and 0 <= col < cols and grid[row, col] != background_color:\n                         visited[row,col] = True\n\n                if obj_pixels:\n                    objects.append((color, obj_pixels))\n            # Ensure every pixel is marked visited eventually\n            visited[r,c] = True \n    return objects\n\ndef get_bounding_box(pixels: set[tuple[int, int]]) -> tuple[int, int, int, int]:\n    \"\"\"Calculates the min/max row/col for a set of pixels.
