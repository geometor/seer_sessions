Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Background:** Each grid has a dominant background color (Yellow/4 in train\_1, Green/3 in train\_2).
2.  **Key Structures:** There are distinct composite objects consisting of an "upper structure" and a "base" below it.
    *   The "upper structure" often involves Blue (1) and Red (2) pixels, forming shapes like 'T's or crosses/pluses.
    *   The "base" is a solid block of a single color directly beneath the upper structure.
3.  **Color Changes:** The primary transformation involves changing the color of the "base" objects.
4.  **Conditional Logic:** The way the base color changes seems dependent on the colors present in the input grid.
    *   In train\_1, bases are Green (3) and Azure (8). In the output, these colors are swapped (Green becomes Azure, Azure becomes Green). Additionally, specific pixels directly under the Red (2) parts of the upper structure change color based on the *original* color of their base (Green base -> Azure below red; Azure base -> Red below red).
    *   In train\_2, bases are both Yellow (4). There's also an isolated Magenta (6) pixel elsewhere. In the output, both Yellow bases become Magenta, and the original Magenta pixel disappears (becomes background Green). The rule for pixels under Red (2) does not seem to apply here.
5.  **Isolated Pixels:** Sometimes, single pixels exist that are not part of the background or the key structures (like the Magenta pixel in train\_2 input). These seem to act as "triggers" for the color change in some cases.
6.  **Anomaly:** In train\_2 output, a new Yellow (4) pixel appears. Its origin isn't immediately clear from the primary transformation logic identified. It might be related to the removed trigger pixel or the original base color, but the exact rule is ambiguous based only on these examples. For now, the core focus is the base color change.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Modify colors of 'base' objects based on color context.

Example 1 (train_1):
  - Background: Yellow (4)
  - Objects:
    - UpperStructure1: T-shape (Blue 1, Red 2) at top-right.
    - Base1: Azure (8) block below UpperStructure1.
    - PixelBelowRed1: Azure (8) pixel at (3, 13).
    - UpperStructure2: T-shape (Blue 1, Red 2) at mid-left.
    - Base2: Green (3) block below UpperStructure2.
    - PixelBelowRed2: Red (2) pixel at (7, 4).
    - UpperStructure3: Plus-shape (Blue 1, Red 2) at bottom-mid.
    - Base3: Green (3) block below UpperStructure3.
    - PixelsBelowRed3: Red (2) pixels at (13, 10), (13, 11), (14, 10), (14, 11).
  - Relationships:
    - Base1 is below UpperStructure1. PixelBelowRed1 is below Red(2) of UpperStructure1.
    - Base2 is below UpperStructure2. PixelBelowRed2 is below Red(2) of UpperStructure2.
    - Base3 is below UpperStructure3. PixelsBelowRed3 are below Red(2) of UpperStructure3.
  - Input State: BaseColors are {Green (3), Azure (8)}.
  - Action: Swap Green (3) and Azure (8) bases.
    - Base1 (Azure 8) -> Green (3).
    - Base2 (Green 3) -> Azure (8).
    - Base3 (Green 3) -> Azure (8).
  - Action: Change color below Red(2) based on original base color.
    - PixelBelowRed1 (original Base1=Azure 8) -> Red (2).
    - PixelBelowRed2 (original Base2=Green 3) -> Azure (8).
    - PixelsBelowRed3 (original Base3=Green 3) -> Azure (8).

Example 2 (train_2):
  - Background: Green (3)
  - Objects:
    - UpperStructure1: T-shape (Blue 1, Red 2) at top-left.
    - Base1: Yellow (4) pixel below UpperStructure1.
    - UpperStructure2: Plus-shape (Blue 1, Red 2) at mid-right.
    - Base2: Yellow (4) block below UpperStructure2.
    - TriggerPixel1: Magenta (6) pixel at (10, 3).
  - Relationships:
    - Base1 is below UpperStructure1.
    - Base2 is below UpperStructure2.
    - TriggerPixel1 is isolated.
  - Input State: BaseColors is {Yellow (4)}. TriggerColors is {Magenta (6)}.
  - Action: Change Bases to Trigger Color.
    - Base1 (Yellow 4) -> Magenta (6).
    - Base2 (Yellow 4) -> Magenta (6).
  - Action: Remove Trigger Pixel.
    - TriggerPixel1 (Magenta 6) -> Background Green (3).
  - Anomaly: New Yellow (4) pixel appears at (14, 3) in output - rule unclear.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the background color.
2.  Locate all "upper structures" (shapes involving connected Blue-1 and Red-2 pixels).
3.  For each upper structure, identify its "base" - the connected block of a single color directly beneath it. If no such block exists, the upper structure has no base.
4.  Create a list of the colors of all identified bases.
5.  **Condition Check:** Determine if both Green (3) and Azure (8) are present in the list of base colors.
    *   **If YES (Swap Case):**
        *   For each base that is Green (3), change all its pixels to Azure (8).
        *   For each base that is Azure (8), change all its pixels to Green (3).
        *   For each pixel located directly below a Red (2) pixel within an upper structure:
            *   If the base originally below that structure was Green (3), change this pixel's color to Azure (8).
            *   If the base originally below that structure was Azure (8), change this pixel's color to Red (2).
    *   **If NO (Trigger Case):**
        *   Identify all "trigger pixels": single pixels in the grid that are not the background color and do not belong to any upper structure or its base.
        *   If any trigger pixels are found:
            *   Assume all trigger pixels have the same color (let this be `TargetColor`). Record the locations of all trigger pixels.
            *   For every identified base (regardless of its original color), change all its pixels to `TargetColor`.
            *   Change all identified trigger pixels to the background color.
        *   If no trigger pixels are found, make no changes to the grid.
6.  Return the modified grid. (Note: This program does not account for the unexplained Yellow pixel appearing in train\_2 output).
