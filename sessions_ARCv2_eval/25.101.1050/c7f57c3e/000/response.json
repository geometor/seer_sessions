            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Background:** Each grid has a dominant background color (Yellow/4 in train\\_1, Green/3 in train\\_2).\n2.  **Key Structures:** There are distinct composite objects consisting of an \"upper structure\" and a \"base\" below it.\n    *   The \"upper structure\" often involves Blue (1) and Red (2) pixels, forming shapes like 'T's or crosses/pluses.\n    *   The \"base\" is a solid block of a single color directly beneath the upper structure.\n3.  **Color Changes:** The primary transformation involves changing the color of the \"base\" objects.\n4.  **Conditional Logic:** The way the base color changes seems dependent on the colors present in the input grid.\n    *   In train\\_1, bases are Green (3) and Azure (8). In the output, these colors are swapped (Green becomes Azure, Azure becomes Green). Additionally, specific pixels directly under the Red (2) parts of the upper structure change color based on the *original* color of their base (Green base -> Azure below red; Azure base -> Red below red).\n    *   In train\\_2, bases are both Yellow (4). There's also an isolated Magenta (6) pixel elsewhere. In the output, both Yellow bases become Magenta, and the original Magenta pixel disappears (becomes background Green). The rule for pixels under Red (2) does not seem to apply here.\n5.  **Isolated Pixels:** Sometimes, single pixels exist that are not part of the background or the key structures (like the Magenta pixel in train\\_2 input). These seem to act as \"triggers\" for the color change in some cases.\n6.  **Anomaly:** In train\\_2 output, a new Yellow (4) pixel appears. Its origin isn't immediately clear from the primary transformation logic identified. It might be related to the removed trigger pixel or the original base color, but the exact rule is ambiguous based only on these examples. For now, the core focus is the base color change.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
