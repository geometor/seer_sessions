Some of these objects seem to act as sources for a filling process.\n3.  **Filling Process:** The background color pixels adjacent to certain source colors are replaced by new \"fill\" colors.\n4.  **Propagation:** This filling process propagates outwards from the source-adjacent pixels, step-by-step, replacing more background pixels.\n5.  **Barriers:** Existing non-background objects (that aren't sources for the current fill) and the grid boundaries act as barriers, stopping the fill propagation.\n6.  **Multiple Fills & Priority:** Multiple source colors can initiate fills simultaneously, often using different fill colors. When different fills attempt to color the same pixel, a priority rule determines the final color. Observing the examples, it appears the fill color with the *lower* numerical index takes precedence (e.g., green/3 overwrites gray/5 in train_2; magenta/6 overwrites maroon/9 in train_3; green/3 overwrites magenta/6 which overwrites orange/7 in train_4).\n7.  **Source-Fill Mapping:** The color used for filling seems related to the source color it originates from, but the mapping isn't always identity and appears specific to the task instance:\n    *   train_1: Blue(1) source -> Green(3) fill.\n    *   train_2: Blue(1) source -> Green(3) fill; Yellow(4) source -> Gray(5) fill.\n    *   train_3: Blue(1) source -> Magenta(6) fill; Red(2) source -> Maroon(9) fill.\n    *   train_4: Green(3) source -> Green(3) fill; Magenta(6) source -> Magenta(6) fill; Orange(7) source -> Orange(7) fill.\n    *   The sources seem to be the non-background colors directly adjacent to the background in the input grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

A \"Source Color\" is a non-background color in the input grid that is orthogonally adjacent to at least one background pixel. The \"Fill Color\" is the color that replaces the background pixels adjacent to that Source Color in the output. Note these pairs (e.g., in train_2, Blue(1) is a source for Green(3) fill, and Yellow(4) is a source for Gray(5) fill).\n3.  **Prioritize Fills:** Create a priority order for the identified Fill Colors based on their numerical index. Lower indices have higher priority (e.g., Green(3) has higher priority than Gray(5)).\n4.  **Initialize Output:** Create a working copy of the input grid.\n5.  **Iterative Filling:** Repeatedly iterate through the following process until a full iteration occurs with no pixels changing color:\n    a.  Create a temporary grid for the next state, initially identical to the working grid from the previous step.\n    b.  For every pixel location `(r, c)` in the grid:\n        i.   Examine the orthogonal neighbors of `(r, c)` in the *current* working grid.\n        ii.  Identify any neighbors that are Source Colors according to the mappings found in step 2.\n        iii. Determine the set of potential Fill Colors that could influence pixel `(r, c)` based on the Source Colors of its neighbors and the established mappings.\n        iv.  If there are potential Fill Colors:\n            1.  Select the Fill Color with the highest priority (lowest index) from the potential set. Let this be `Winning_Fill_Color`.\n            2.  Get the color currently at `(r, c)` in the *temporary* next state grid. Let this be `Current_Color`.\n            3.  If `Current_Color` is the background color, OR if `Winning_Fill_Color` has a higher priority (lower index) than `Current_Color`:\n                *   Update the pixel at `(r, c)` in the temporary next state grid to `Winning_Fill_Color`.\n    c.  After checking all pixels, update the working grid to be the temporary next state grid.\n6.  **Final Output:** Once an iteration completes with no changes, the working grid represents the final output."
