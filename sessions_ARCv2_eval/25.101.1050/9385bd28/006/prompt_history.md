Okay, let's analyze the transformation logic for this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Background Color:** In each example, there's a dominant color acting as a background (white/0 in train_1, train_2, train_4; green/3 in train_3).
2.  **Objects/Source Colors:** There are various contiguous shapes (objects) of different colors embedded within or adjacent to the background. Some of these objects seem to act as sources for a filling process.
3.  **Filling Process:** The background color pixels adjacent to certain source colors are replaced by new "fill" colors.
4.  **Propagation:** This filling process propagates outwards from the source-adjacent pixels, step-by-step, replacing more background pixels.
5.  **Barriers:** Existing non-background objects (that aren't sources for the current fill) and the grid boundaries act as barriers, stopping the fill propagation.
6.  **Multiple Fills & Priority:** Multiple source colors can initiate fills simultaneously, often using different fill colors. When different fills attempt to color the same pixel, a priority rule determines the final color. Observing the examples, it appears the fill color with the *lower* numerical index takes precedence (e.g., green/3 overwrites gray/5 in train_2; magenta/6 overwrites maroon/9 in train_3; green/3 overwrites magenta/6 which overwrites orange/7 in train_4).
7.  **Source-Fill Mapping:** The color used for filling seems related to the source color it originates from, but the mapping isn't always identity and appears specific to the task instance:
    *   train_1: Blue(1) source -> Green(3) fill.
    *   train_2: Blue(1) source -> Green(3) fill; Yellow(4) source -> Gray(5) fill.
    *   train_3: Blue(1) source -> Magenta(6) fill; Red(2) source -> Maroon(9) fill.
    *   train_4: Green(3) source -> Green(3) fill; Magenta(6) source -> Magenta(6) fill; Orange(7) source -> Orange(7) fill.
    *   The sources seem to be the non-background colors directly adjacent to the background in the input grid.

        - For each pixel (r, c):
          - Get current color `curr = working_grid[r, c]`.
          - Find orthogonal neighbors and their non-background colors `N` in working_grid.
          - Determine potential fill colors `P` for (r,c) based on mappings from `N`.
          - If `P` is not empty:
            - Find highest priority (lowest index) fill `f_p` in `P`.
            - If `curr` is background OR `f_p` has higher priority than `curr`:
              - If `next_grid[r, c] != f_p`:
                 - Set `next_grid[r, c] = f_p`. Mark change occurred.
        - Update `working_grid = next_grid`.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Background:** Determine the most common pixel color in the input grid; this is the "background color".
2.  **Identify Source-Fill Mappings:** Analyze the input and output examples to find pairs of (Source Color, Fill Color). A "Source Color" is a non-background color in the input grid that is orthogonally adjacent to at least one background pixel. The "Fill Color" is the color that replaces the background pixels adjacent to that Source Color in the output. Note these pairs (e.g., in train_2, Blue(1) is a source for Green(3) fill, and Yellow(4) is a source for Gray(5) fill).
3.  **Prioritize Fills:** Create a priority order for the identified Fill Colors based on their numerical index. Lower indices have higher priority (e.g., Green(3) has higher priority than Gray(5)).
4.  **Initialize Output:** Create a working copy of the input grid.
5.  **Iterative Filling:** Repeatedly iterate through the following process until a full iteration occurs with no pixels changing color:
    a.  Create a temporary grid for the next state, initially identical to the working grid from the previous step.
    b.  For every pixel location `(r, c)` in the grid:
        i.   Examine the orthogonal neighbors of `(r, c)` in the *current* working grid.
        ii.  Identify any neighbors that are Source Colors according to the mappings found in step 2.
        iii. Determine the set of potential Fill Colors that could influence pixel `(r, c)` based on the Source Colors of its neighbors and the established mappings.
        iv.  If there are potential Fill Colors:
            1.  Select the Fill Color with the highest priority (lowest index) from the potential set. Let this be `Winning_Fill_Color`.
            2.  Get the color currently at `(r, c)` in the *temporary* next state grid. Let this be `Current_Color`.
            3.  If `Current_Color` is the background color, OR if `Winning_Fill_Color` has a higher priority (lower index) than `Current_Color`:
                *   Update the pixel at `(r, c)` in the temporary next state grid to `Winning_Fill_Color`.
    c.  After checking all pixels, update the working grid to be the temporary next state grid.
6.  **Final Output:** Once an iteration completes with no changes, the working grid represents the final output.

Transformation Rule:

1.  Identify the background color (most frequent color in the input grid).
2.  Determine the source-to-fill color mapping based on color adjacency to the background:
    a. Find 'source' colors: non-background colors where at least one pixel of that color is orthogonally adjacent to the background color.
    b. Find 'potential fill-determining' colors (PFDs): non-background colors where *no* pixel of that color is orthogonally adjacent to the background color.
    c. If PFDs exist:
        - Each source color maps to the PFD color that is 'closest'. Closeness is defined as the minimum Manhattan distance between any pixel of the source color and any pixel of the PFD color.
        - Ties in distance are broken by choosing the PFD color with the lower numerical index (color value).
    d. If no PFDs exist:
        - Each source color maps to itself (identity map). Source colors that are not adjacent to the background are ignored.
3.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
4.  Perform an iterative flood-fill process until no changes occur in a full grid scan:
    a. In each iteration, calculate the next state of the grid based on the current state.
    b. For each pixel `(r, c)` in the grid:
        i.  Examine its orthogonal neighbors in the *current* grid state.
        ii. Collect 'fill influences' from neighbors:
            - If a neighbor has a color `N` which is a source color (from step 2a), its influence is the corresponding fill color `F` from the mapping (step 2c/2d).
            - If a neighbor has a color `N` which is itself one of the fill colors active in the mapping, its influence is `N`.
        iii. If there are any fill influences, determine the 'winning' fill color: the influencing fill color with the lowest numerical index (highest priority).
        iv. Consider the current color `C` at `(r, c)`.
        v.  If `C` is the background color, update the pixel in the *next* grid state to the winning fill color.
        vi. If `C` is not the background color, update the pixel in the *next* grid state to the winning fill color *only if* the winning fill color's index is strictly lower than `C`'s index (i.e., the winning fill has higher priority).
    c. After scanning all pixels, update the current grid state to the calculated next state.
5.  Once an iteration completes with no changes, return the final grid state.

Transformation Rule:

1.  Identify the background color (most frequent color in the input grid).
2.  Determine the source-to-fill color mapping based on color adjacency to the background:
    a. Find 'source' colors: non-background colors where at least one pixel of that color is orthogonally adjacent to the background color.
    b. Find 'potential fill-determining' colors (PFDs): non-background colors where *no* pixel of that color is orthogonally adjacent to the background color.
    c. If PFDs exist:
        - Each source color maps to the PFD color that is 'closest'. Closeness is defined as the minimum Manhattan distance between any pixel of the source color and any pixel of the PFD color.
        - Ties in distance are broken by choosing the PFD color with the lower numerical index (color value).
    d. If no PFDs exist:
        - Each source color maps to itself (identity map). Source colors that are not adjacent to the background are ignored.
3.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
4.  Perform an iterative flood-fill process until no changes occur in a full grid scan:
    a. In each iteration, calculate the next state of the grid based on the current state.
    b. For each pixel `(r, c)` in the grid:
        i.  Examine its orthogonal neighbors in the *current* grid state.
        ii. Collect 'fill influences' from neighbors:
            - If a neighbor has a color `N` which is a source color (from step 2a), its influence is the corresponding fill color `F` from the mapping (step 2c/2d).
            - If a neighbor has a color `N` which is itself one of the fill colors active in the mapping, its influence is `N`.
        iii. If there are any fill influences, determine the 'winning' fill color: the influencing fill color with the lowest numerical index (highest priority).
        iv. Consider the current color `C` at `(r, c)`.
        v.  If `C` is the background color, update the pixel in the *next* grid state to the winning fill color.
        vi. If `C` is not the background color, update the pixel in the *next* grid state to the winning fill color *only if* the winning fill color's index is strictly lower than `C`'s index (i.e., the winning fill has higher priority).
    c. After scanning all pixels, update the current grid state to the calculated next state.
5.  Once an iteration completes with no changes, return the final grid state.

Okay, let's analyze the failed results and refine the understanding of the task.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code failed significantly on all training examples, producing outputs that were entirely filled with a single color, which was inconsistent across examples and did not match the expected outputs. The core transformation appears to be a flood fill originating from certain "source" pixels, replacing the background color. However, the previous code failed to correctly identify the source-to-fill color mapping and potentially the flood fill logic or priority rules.

The strategy is to:

1.  Re-analyze the input/output pairs to precisely define:
    *   The background color (BG).
    *   The "Source" colors (S): Non-BG colors adjacent to BG in the input.
    *   The "Potential Fill Determiner" colors (P): Non-BG colors *not* adjacent to BG in the input.
    *   The actual "Fill" colors (F): Colors appearing in the output where BG was in the input.
2.  Formulate a robust hypothesis for the Source -> Fill mapping based on the relationship between S, P, and F across all examples. Hypothesis 9 seemed promising:
    *   If P is empty, Map: S -> S. Fill colors: S.
    *   If P has one color p, Map: all S -> p. Fill color: {p}.
    *   If P has multiple colors, Map: each s in S -> closest p in P (Manhattan distance, tie-break low p index). Fill colors: P.
3.  Verify the flood fill mechanism: iterative expansion from sources, respecting existing non-BG colors as barriers, and applying priority where fills compete (lower color index wins).
4.  Use code execution to gather metrics and verify the components (BG, S, P, Map) for each example under the revised hypothesis.
5.  Update the YAML fact document and natural language program based on the refined understanding.

**Metrics Analysis and Findings**

The metrics gathered confirm the analysis:

*   **Examples 1, 2, 3, 4:** All have an empty PFD set (P={}). All non-background colors are adjacent to the background.
*   **Hypothesis 9 Prediction (P empty):** The hypothesis dictates an S -> S mapping (identity map) and predicts that the fill colors (F) should be all source colors (S).
*   **Observed Fill Colors:**
    *   Example 1: Observed F={3}. Hypothesis predicts F={1, 2, 3}. Mismatch.
    *   Example 2: Observed F={3, 5}. Hypothesis predicts F={1, 3, 4, 5}. Mismatch.
    *   Example 3: Observed F={6, 9}. Hypothesis predicts F={0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}. Mismatch.
    *   Example 4: Observed F={3, 4, 7}. Hypothesis predicts F={3, 4, 6, 7}. Mismatch (observed missing 6).

**Revised Conclusion:** Hypothesis 9 (and its parent, H5/H7) which relied on the PFD concept (colors *not* adjacent to background) fails because in *all* these examples, *all* non-background colors *are* adjacent to the background (PFD set is empty). The simple S->S mapping rule for the empty PFD case is incorrect.

A new hypothesis is needed for the source->fill mapping when *all* non-background colors are sources (P is empty). The observed fill colors are a *subset* of the source colors. How is this subset determined?

*   Ex 1: S={1,2,3}, F={3} (Max index in S)
*   Ex 2: S={1,3,4,5}, F={3,5} (The two highest indices?)
*   Ex 3: S={0,1,2,4,5,6,8,9}, F={6,9} (The two highest indices are 8, 9. So not exactly). Maybe the two highest index colors that are > BG? (BG=3, S>3 are {4,5,6,8,9}. Top 2 are {8,9}. Still no.) What if it's the 2nd and 4th highest? (9, 6). This seems arbitrary.
*   Ex 4: S={3,4,6,7}, F={3,4,7} (All except 6? Why is 6 excluded?).

Let's rethink the simplest case: a flood fill occurs. Where does the *color* come from?

**Hypothesis 13 (Nearest Source Wins):**
1.  Identify BG.
2.  Iteratively fill BG pixels.
3.  For a BG pixel `(r, c)` being considered for filling:
    a.  Look at its already filled or original non-BG neighbors.
    b.  Identify the *original* source colors S present in the input grid that are "closest" (Manhattan distance) to `(r, c)`.
    c.  Among the closest source colors, select the one with the lowest index `s_win`.
    d.  Fill pixel `(r, c)` with `s_win`.
    e.  Propagation continues using the newly filled color `s_win`. Priority during propagation: lower index color wins if multiple fills reach the same pixel simultaneously.

This avoids pre-calculating a map. The fill color is determined dynamically based on proximity to original source objects.

Let's test on Ex 1: BG=0. Sources S={1,2,3}. Pixel (1,4)=0. Neighbors (0,4)=0, (1,3)=0, (1,5)=0, (2,4)=1. Only neighbor color is 1. Fill (1,4) with 1? No, output is 3.

**Hypothesis 14 (Fill with Neighboring Source Color - Standard Flood Fill with Priority):**
1.  Identify BG.
2.  Initialize Output = Input.
3.  Iteratively perform flood fill:
    a.  For each pixel `(r,c)`:
        i.   Examine neighbors `(nr, nc)` in the *current* grid state.
        ii.  Collect potential fill colors `C_fill` from neighbors that are *not* BG.
        iii. If `C_fill` is not empty, find the winning color `f_win` = color with the lowest index in `C_fill`.
        iv.  If the current color at `(r,c)` is BG, update `next_grid[r,c] = f_win`.
        v.   If the current color `C_curr` at `(r,c)` is *not* BG, update `next_grid[r,c] = f_win` only if `f_win < C_curr`.
    b.  Repeat until no changes occur.

This is essentially a standard multi-source flood fill where sources are all non-background colors, and priority is given by the color index.

*   Ex 1: S={1,2,3}. Fills with 1, 2, 3. Priority 1>2>3. Should fill most areas with 1. Fails.
*   Ex 2: S={1,3,4,5}. Fills with 1,3,4,5. Priority 1>3>4>5. Should fill most with 1. Fails.
*   Ex 3: S={0,1,2,4,5,6,8,9}. Fills with 0..9. Priority 0>1>2>... Should fill most with 0. Fails.
*   Ex 4: S={3,4,6,7}. Fills with 3,4,6,7. Priority 3>4>6>7. Should fill most with 3. Fails (output has 4, 7 fills too).

**Final Conclusion Before YAML/NL Program:** The mechanism isn't a standard flood fill based *solely* on the source color index for priority, nor a simple PFD rule. There's a specific rule determining *which* of the source colors actually participate in filling and potentially *what* color they fill with, which isn't captured yet. Given the consistent failure to find a unifying rule, the most accurate description based *only* on the current observations is the simplest: some non-background colors fill the background, propagating outwards, with lower index colors overwriting higher ones. The exact rule for choosing the fill color(s) is specific to each example and not generalizable from these examples alone using the tested hypotheses.

However, for the purpose of the exercise, I will document the process closest to the observations, which is a flood fill where the fill color seems related to the sources, but the exact mapping/selection rule is unclear. I'll base the YAML/NL on the standard flood fill idea (Hypothesis 14) while acknowledging its limitations based on the metrics.

```yaml
task_description: Fill background pixels based on adjacent non-background colors using iterative propagation with priority, although the precise rule for selecting active fill colors is complex and varies.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties: Contains pixels with color values 0-9.
  - type: background_pixel
    properties:
      - color: The most frequent color in the input grid (BG).
      - role: Target pixels to be replaced during the transformation.
  - type: non_background_pixel
    properties:
      - color: Any color other than BG present in the input grid.
      - role: Act as barriers to filling and potentially as sources for fill colors.
  - type: source_pixel
    subtype_of: non_background_pixel
    properties:
      # In these examples, all non_background_pixels are adjacent to the background.
      - location: Adjacent (orthogonally) to at least one background_pixel in the input grid.
      - color: The specific non-background color (S).
      - role: Initiates or influences the fill process.
  - type: fill_pixel
    properties:
      - color: A color that replaces a background_pixel in the output grid (F).
      - relationship: Empirically, F is always one of the non_background_pixel colors present in the input.
      - priority: Determined by the fill color's index (lower index = higher priority). A lower index fill color overwrites a higher index fill color or a background color.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: [pixel, pixel]
    properties: Orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right).
  - type: determines_fill (Hypothesized - Failed)
    from: source_pixel_color (S)
    to: fill_pixel_color (F)
    properties: Various hypotheses tested (PFD distance, S->S mapping, etc.) did not consistently match observed F across all examples. The specific selection mechanism for F remains unclear but seems to be a subset of S.
  - type: overwrites
    from: lower_index_fill_pixel
    to: higher_index_fill_pixel or background_pixel
    properties: Occurs when multiple fills compete for the same pixel location during propagation; the lowest color index prevails.

    output: output_grid
    steps:
      - Initialize working_grid = input_grid.
      - Repeat until no changes occur in an iteration:
        - Create next_grid = copy of working_grid.
        - For each pixel (r, c):
          - Get current color `curr = working_grid[r, c]`.
          - Find colors `N` of non-BG orthogonal neighbors in working_grid.
          - If `N` is not empty:
            - Find highest priority (lowest index) color `f_p` in `N`.
            - If `curr == BG`:
              - Set `next_grid[r, c] = f_p`. Mark change occurred.
            - Else (`curr != BG`):
              - If `f_p < curr`: # Check priority
                - Set `next_grid[r, c] = f_p`. Mark change occurred.
        - Update `working_grid = next_grid`.
    notes: This standard flood fill does not replicate the observed outputs accurately, suggesting the initial propagation or color selection rule is more complex than simply using all non-BG neighbors with index priority. The observed fill colors (F) are a specific subset of the source colors (S), but the selection rule for F is not determined.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Background:** Determine the most frequent pixel color in the input grid. This is the "background color" (BG).
2.  **Identify Sources:** Identify all non-background colors present in the input grid (S). In these examples, all non-background colors happen to be adjacent to the background.
3.  **Initialize Output:** Create a working copy of the input grid.
4.  **Iterative Filling with Priority:** Repeatedly iterate through the grid until no pixel changes color in a full pass:
    a.  For the current iteration, create a temporary grid based on the working grid from the previous iteration.
    b.  For each pixel location `(r, c)`:
        i.   Examine the orthogonal neighbors of `(r, c)` in the *current* working grid.
        ii.  Collect the colors of any neighbors that are *not* the background color.
        iii. If one or more non-background neighbors exist:
            1.  Determine the "winning" color by selecting the neighbor color with the lowest numerical index (highest priority).
            2.  Get the color currently at `(r, c)` in the *working* grid (let's call it `current_pixel_color`).
            3.  If `current_pixel_color` is the background color, update the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *temporary* grid to the winning color.
            4.  If `current_pixel_color` is *not* the background color, update the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *temporary* grid to the winning color *only if* the winning color's index is strictly less than `current_pixel_color`'s index (i.e., the winning color has higher priority).
    c.  After checking all pixels, update the working grid to be the temporary grid for the next iteration.
5.  **Final Output:** Once an iteration completes with no changes, the working grid is the final output.

**(Caveat):** While this program describes a standard priority flood fill initiated by all non-background colors, analysis shows it does not correctly reproduce the specific fill colors observed in the examples. The actual transformation likely involves a more nuanced rule to determine which non-background colors participate in filling and/or which color they propagate, especially when all non-background colors are adjacent to the background.
```python
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter

"""
Transformation Rule:

1.  Identify the background color (BG) as the most frequent pixel color in the input grid.
2.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
3.  Perform an iterative flood fill process based on neighbor colors and priority until no pixels change color in a full iteration:
    a.  In each iteration, determine the next state of the grid based on the current state.
    b.  For every pixel location `(r, c)`:
        i.   Examine its orthogonal neighbors in the *current* grid state.
        ii.  Collect the colors of any neighbors that are *not* the background color (BG).
        iii. If one or more non-background neighbors exist:
            1.  Determine the "winning fill color" by selecting the neighbor color with the lowest numerical index (highest priority).
            2.  Get the color currently at `(r, c)` in the *current* grid state (`current_pixel_color`).
            3.  If `current_pixel_color` is the background color (BG), update the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *next* grid state to the winning fill color.
            4.  If `current_pixel_color` is *not* the background color, update the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *next* grid state to the winning fill color *only if* the winning fill color's index is strictly less than `current_pixel_color`'s index (i.e., the winning color has higher priority).
    c.  After checking all pixels, update the current grid state to the calculated next state for the subsequent iteration.
4.  Return the final grid state after the process stabilizes.

(Caveat): Analysis of the training examples indicates this standard priority flood fill does not perfectly reproduce the outputs. The actual transformation might involve a more complex rule for selecting which non-background colors initiate the fill or what color they propagate. This implementation reflects the standard priority fill described.

**General Assessment:**

The previous attempt using a standard priority flood fill (Hypothesis 14) failed on all examples. The transformed outputs did not resemble the expected outputs, indicating that the core assumption—that all non-background colors simply propagate themselves with index-based priority—is incorrect.

The key observations remain:
1.  A background color (BG) is filled.
2.  The filling originates from or is influenced by adjacent non-background colors (Sources, S).
3.  Existing non-background colors act as barriers.
4.  Where different fills compete, the one with the lower color index takes precedence.

The critical missing piece is the rule determining *which* color is used for filling based on the adjacent source(s). The previous code's failure confirms that the source color itself is not always the fill color. Hypothesis 15, where a mapping from Source Color (S) to Fill Color (F) is inferred directly from the input-output pair, appears promising. This mapping seems specific to each task instance.

**Strategy:**

1.  Implement code to automatically infer the Source-to-Fill (S -> F) mapping based on adjacency in the input and output grids.
2.  Verify if this inferred map is consistent within each example and across examples.
3.  Refine the YAML description and Natural Language Program to incorporate this map derivation step.
4.  The flood fill logic will then use the *mapped* fill color associated with influencing neighbors, still applying the lower-index priority rule for conflicts.

**Metrics Gathering (Hypothesis 15):**

The following code attempts to derive the S -> F mapping for each example. For each source color `s`, it looks at the background pixels adjacent to `s` in the input and finds the most common non-background color in the corresponding positions in the output.

**Metrics Analysis (Hypothesis 15):**

The metrics strongly support Hypothesis 15:

1.  **Map Inference:** The automated inference process successfully derived a Source-to-Fill (S -> F) mapping for each example.
2.  **Map Consistency:** The set of fill colors derived from the inferred map (`Inferred Fill Colors (F)`) exactly matches the set of colors observed replacing the background in the output (`Observed Fill Colors`) for all four examples.
3.  **Specific Mappings:**
    *   Ex 1: All sources {1, 2, 3} map to fill color {3}.
    *   Ex 2: Source {1} maps to {3}, Source {4} maps to {5}. Sources {3, 5} do not appear to initiate fills distinct from their neighbors' influence or their own color being overwritten/maintained. The inference only captures {1:3, 4:5}.
    *   Ex 3: Source {1} maps to {6}, Source {2} maps to {9}, Source {4} maps to {6}. Other sources don't generate distinct fills based on the adjacency analysis.
    *   Ex 4: Source {3} maps to {3}, Source {4} maps to {4}, Source {6} maps to {7}, Source {7} maps to {7}.
4.  **Conclusion:** The transformation involves identifying the background, determining a specific S->F mapping by observing which output colors replace background pixels adjacent to input source pixels, and then performing a priority flood fill using these mapped colors.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill background pixels based on adjacent source colors using iterative propagation with priority, where the fill color is determined by a mapping derived from the input-output example.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties: Contains pixels with color values 0-9.
  - type: background_pixel
    properties:
      - color: The most frequent color in the input grid (BG).
      - role: Target pixels to be replaced during the transformation.
  - type: source_pixel
    properties:
      - color: A non-background color (S) in the input grid that is orthogonally adjacent to at least one background_pixel.
      - role: Influences the color of adjacent background pixels in the output, potentially mapping to a different fill color.
      - location: Coordinates (r, c) where the source pixel exists.
  - type: fill_pixel
    properties:
      - color: A color (F) that replaces a background_pixel in the output grid. It is determined by the source_pixel(s) adjacent to the original background_pixel via a derived mapping.
      - priority: Determined by the fill color's index (lower index = higher priority).
  - type: source_fill_map
    properties:
      - type: dictionary mapping S -> F.
      - derivation: Inferred by examining, for each source color S, the output colors F that replace the background pixels originally adjacent to S. The most frequent F (with tie-breaking using the lowest F index) becomes the mapped value for S.
      - scope: Applies to the specific task instance.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: [pixel, pixel]
    properties: Orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right).
  - type: determines_fill_via_map
    from: source_pixel_color (S)
    to: fill_pixel_color (F)
    using: source_fill_map
    properties: A source pixel S influences adjacent background pixels to become color F = source_fill_map[S].
  - type: overwrites
    from: lower_index_fill_pixel or lower_index_source_pixel
    to: higher_index_fill_pixel, higher_index_source_pixel, or background_pixel
    properties: Occurs when multiple colors compete for the same pixel location during propagation; the color with the lowest index prevails.

actions:
  - name: identify_background_color
    target: input_grid
    output: background_color_value (BG)
  - name: identify_source_pixels_and_colors
    target: input_grid, background_color_value
    output: set of source_colors (S), dictionary of source_pixel_coordinates per color.
  - name: derive_source_fill_map

    output: dictionary source_fill_map (S -> F)
    steps:
      - Initialize empty map M.
      - For each source color s in S:
        - Collect list L of output colors at (r, c) for all input pixels (r, c) that were BG and adjacent to any pixel of color s.
        - Filter L to remove BG color.
        - If L is not empty:
          - Find the most frequent color(s) f in L.
          - If tied, select the f with the minimum color index.
          - Add mapping M[s] = f.
  - name: iterative_mapped_priority_flood_fill
    target: input_grid
    using:
        - background_color (BG)
        - source_fill_map (M)
        - priority_rule (lower color index wins)
    output: output_grid
    steps:
      - Initialize working_grid = input_grid.
      - Get the set of actual fill colors F used (values in M).
      - Repeat until no changes occur in an iteration:
        - Create next_grid = copy of working_grid.
        - For each pixel (r, c):
          - Get current color `curr = working_grid[r, c]`.
          - Find potential fill influences:
            - For each orthogonal neighbor `(nr, nc)` with color `C_neighbor` in working_grid:
              - If `C_neighbor` is a source color `s` present in the input mapping `M`, the influence is `M[s]`.
              - If `C_neighbor` is already a fill color `f` (a value in `M`), the influence is `f`.
          - If influences exist:
            - Find highest priority (lowest index) influence color `f_win`.
            - If `curr == BG`:
              - Set `next_grid[r, c] = f_win`. Mark change occurred.
            - Else (`curr != BG`):
              - If `f_win < curr`: # Check priority
                - Set `next_grid[r, c] = f_win`. Mark change occurred.
        - Update `working_grid = next_grid`.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Background:** Determine the most frequent pixel color in the input grid; this is the "background color" (BG).
2.  **Identify Sources:** Identify all non-background colors in the input grid that are orthogonally adjacent to at least one background pixel. These are the "source colors" (S). Keep track of the coordinates of pixels for each source color.
3.  **Derive Source-to-Fill Map:** Create a mapping (M) from source colors (S) to fill colors (F):
    a.  For each source color `s`:
        i.  Find all background pixels in the *input* grid that are orthogonally adjacent to *any* pixel of color `s`.
        ii. Examine the colors of these corresponding pixel locations in the *output* grid.
        iii. Collect all these output colors that are *not* the background color.
        iv. If any such non-background output colors were collected, find the color that appears most frequently among them. If there's a tie in frequency, choose the color with the lowest numerical index.
        v.  Add an entry to the map M, mapping the source color `s` to this chosen fill color `f`. (M[s] = f).
4.  **Initialize Output:** Create a working copy of the input grid.
5.  **Iterative Filling using Map:** Repeatedly iterate through the grid until no pixel changes color in a full pass:
    a.  Create a temporary grid for the next state, copying the current working grid.
    b.  For each pixel location `(r, c)`:
        i.   Examine the orthogonal neighbors `(nr, nc)` in the *current* working grid.
        ii.  Determine potential "fill influences" from neighbors:
            *   If a neighbor's color `C_neighbor` is a source color `s` that has an entry in the map M, its influence is the mapped fill color `M[s]`.
            *   If a neighbor's color `C_neighbor` is itself a fill color `f` (i.e., it's one of the values present in the map M), its influence is `f`.
        iii. If one or more fill influences exist for pixel `(r, c)`:
            1.  Select the "winning fill color" from the influences by choosing the color with the lowest numerical index (highest priority).
            2.  Get the color currently at `(r, c)` in the *working* grid (`current_pixel_color`).
            3.  If `current_pixel_color` is the background color, update the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *temporary* grid to the winning fill color.
            4.  If `current_pixel_color` is *not* the background color, update the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *temporary* grid to the winning fill color *only if* the winning fill color's index is strictly less than `current_pixel_color`'s index.
    c.  After checking all pixels, update the working grid to be the temporary grid for the next iteration.
6.  **Final Output:** Once an iteration completes with no changes, the working grid is the final output.
```python
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter

"""
Transformation Rule:

1.  Identify the background color (BG) as the most frequent pixel color in the input grid.
2.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
3.  Perform an iterative flood fill process based on neighbor colors and priority until no pixels change color in a full iteration:
    a.  In each iteration, determine the next state of the grid based on the current state.
    b.  For every pixel location `(r, c)`:
        i.   Examine its orthogonal neighbors in the *current* grid state.
        ii.  Collect the colors of any neighbors that are *not* the background color (BG).
        iii. If one or more non-background neighbors exist:
            1.  Determine the "winning fill color" by selecting the neighbor color with the lowest numerical index (highest priority).
            2.  Get the color currently at `(r, c)` in the *current* grid state (`current_pixel_color`).
            3.  If `current_pixel_color` is the background color (BG), update the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *next* grid state to the winning fill color.
            4.  If `current_pixel_color` is *not* the background color, update the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *next* grid state to the winning fill color *only if* the winning fill color's index is strictly less than `current_pixel_color`'s index (i.e., the winning color has higher priority).
    c.  After checking all pixels, update the current grid state to the calculated next state for the subsequent iteration.
4.  Return the final grid state after the process stabilizes.

(Caveat): Analysis of the training examples indicates this standard priority flood fill does not perfectly reproduce the outputs. The actual transformation likely involves a more complex rule for selecting which non-background colors initiate the fill or what color they propagate, potentially via a specific mapping derived from input properties not captured by this simple flood fill. This implementation reflects the standard priority fill described.
