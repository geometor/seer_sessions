            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code execution failed because it implemented a standard priority flood fill where each non-background neighbor propagated its own color. Analysis of the input/output pairs revealed that a specific mapping from the initial \"source\" colors (S) adjacent to the background (BG) to the actual \"fill\" colors (F) is required.\n\nThe metrics gathered using `infer_mapping` (based on Hypothesis 15) confirmed that such a map exists and accurately predicts the observed fill colors for each training example. However, deriving this map *predictively* from the input grid alone remains the key challenge.\n\nSeveral hypotheses for deriving the S->F map were explored:\n*   Mapping to the closest source with a higher index (Hypothesis 16): Failed.\n*   Mapping based on adjacency to higher-index sources (Hypothesis 20): Showed promise on Examples 2 and 4 but failed on 1 and 3.\n\nGiven these findings, the strategy is:\n1.  Adopt the clearest hypothesis for map derivation, acknowledging its potential limitations. Hypothesis 20 (Map S -> adjacent S' if S' > S) seems the most structured attempt, despite not fitting all examples perfectly. Assume the default map is identity (S->S) unless this adjacency rule applies.\n2.  Implement the transformation using this derived map within the priority flood fill framework identified earlier. The fill process uses the *mapped* color from the source influence.\n3.  Gather metrics based on this refined approach (H20 map + mapped fill).\n4.  Update the YAML and Natural Language program to reflect this specific mapping rule and the subsequent fill process.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (Hypothesis 20 Map)**\n\n\n*code_execution:*\n"

            "text": "\n\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Background:** Determine the most frequent pixel color in the input grid; this is the \"background color\" (BG).\n2.  **Identify Sources and Adjacencies:**\n    a.  Identify all non-background colors in the input grid that are orthogonally adjacent to at least one background pixel. These are the \"source colors\" (S).\n    b.  For each source color, determine which other *different* source colors it is orthogonally adjacent to in the input grid.\n3.  **Derive Source-to-Fill Map (Hypothesis 20):** Create a mapping (M) from source colors (S) to fill colors (F) as follows:\n    a.  For each source color `s`:\n        i.  Check if it is adjacent to any other source color `s'` where `s'` has a higher color index than `s`.\n        ii. If such adjacent higher-index sources exist, map `s` to the *highest* index among them (M[s] = max(adjacent s' > s)).\n        iii. If no such adjacent higher-index source exists, map `s` to itself (M[s] = s).\n4.  **Initialize Output:** Create a working copy of the input grid.\n5.  **Iterative Filling using Map:** Repeatedly iterate through the grid until no pixel changes color in a full pass:\n    a.  Create a temporary grid for the next state, copying the current working grid.\n    b.  Determine the set of all possible fill colors (F_set) that appear as values in the map M.\n    c.  For each pixel location `(r, c)`:\n        i.   Get the `current_color` from the working grid.\n        ii.  Examine the orthogonal neighbors `(nr, nc)` in the *current* working grid.\n        iii. Determine potential \"fill influences\" from neighbors:\n            *   Initialize an empty list of influences.\n            *   For each neighbor's color `C_neighbor`:\n                *   If `C_neighbor` is the background color, ignore it.\n                *   If `C_neighbor` is a source color `s` present as a key in the map M, add the mapped fill color `M[s]` to the influences list.\n                *   Else if `C_neighbor` is a fill color `f` present in the set F_set, add `f` to the influences list.\n        iv. If the influences list is not empty:\n            1.  Select the \"winning fill color\" from the influences by choosing the color with the lowest numerical index (highest priority).\n            2.  Compare the `winning_fill_color` with the `current_pixel_color`.\n            3.  Determine if an update is needed: Update if `current_pixel_color` is BG, OR if `winning_fill_color` has a higher priority (lower index) than `current_pixel_color`.\n            4.  If an update is needed and the `winning_fill_color` is different from the color already in the temporary grid at `(r, c)`, update the temporary grid at `(r, c)` to the `winning_fill_color` and note that a change occurred in this iteration.\n    d.  After checking all pixels, update the working grid to be the temporary grid for the next iteration.\n6.  **Final Output:** Once an iteration completes with no changes, the working grid is the final output.\n\n**(Caveat):** The rule used to derive the source-to-fill map in step 3 is based on the best-fit hypothesis (Hypothesis 20) but is known not to perfectly replicate the mapping for all provided training examples (specifically Examples 1 and 3). The subsequent flood fill process (steps 4-6) operates based on this derived map."
