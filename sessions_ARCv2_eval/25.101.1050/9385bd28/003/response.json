Identify the background color (BG) as the most frequent pixel color in the input grid.\n2.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n3.  Perform an iterative flood fill process based on neighbor colors and priority until no pixels change color in a full iteration:\n    a.  In each iteration, determine the next state of the grid based on the current state.\n    b.  For every pixel location `(r, c)`:\n        i.   Examine its orthogonal neighbors in the *current* grid state.\n        ii.  Collect the colors of any neighbors that are *not* the background color (BG).\n        iii. If one or more non-background neighbors exist:\n            1.  Determine the \"winning fill color\" by selecting the neighbor color with the lowest numerical index (highest priority).\n            2.  Get the color currently at `(r, c)` in the *current* grid state (`current_pixel_color`).\n            3.  If `current_pixel_color` is the background color (BG), update the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *next* grid state to the winning fill color.\n            4.  If `current_pixel_color` is *not* the background color, update the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *next* grid state to the winning fill color *only if* the winning fill color's index is strictly less than `current_pixel_color`'s index (i.e., the winning color has higher priority).\n    c.  After checking all pixels, update the current grid state to the calculated next state for the subsequent iteration.\n4.  Return the final grid state after the process stabilizes.\n\n(Caveat): Analysis of the training examples indicates this standard priority flood fill does not perfectly reproduce the outputs. The actual transformation might involve a more complex rule for selecting which non-background colors initiate the fill or what color they propagate. This implementation reflects the standard priority fill described.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_background_color(grid_np: np.ndarray) -> int:\n    \"\"\" Finds the most frequent color in the grid. \"\"\"\n    if grid_np.size == 0:\n        # Return a default or raise error for empty grid\n        return 0 # Assuming 0 default background if grid is empty\n    colors, counts = np.unique(grid_np, return_counts=True)\n    # Handle the case where the grid might be empty or have no colors after unique\n    if len(colors) == 0:\n        return 0 # Default assumption\n    return colors[np.argmax(counts)]\n\ndef get_neighbors(h: int, w: int, r: int, c: int) -> list[tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\" Get orthogonal neighbor coordinates within grid bounds. \"\"\"\n    neighbors = []\n    if r > 0: neighbors.append((r - 1, c))\n    if r < h - 1: neighbors.append((r + 1, c))\n    if c > 0: neighbors.append((r, c - 1))\n    if c < w - 1: neighbors.append((r, c + 1))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a priority flood fill transformation based on neighbor colors.\n    Lower color index means higher priority.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    h, w = input_grid_np.shape\n\n    # Handle edge case: empty grid\n    if h == 0 or w == 0:\n        return input_grid\n\n    # 1.
