            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous attempt using a standard priority flood fill (Hypothesis 14) failed on all examples. The transformed outputs did not resemble the expected outputs, indicating that the core assumption\u2014that all non-background colors simply propagate themselves with index-based priority\u2014is incorrect.\n\nThe key observations remain:\n1.  A background color (BG) is filled.\n2.  The filling originates from or is influenced by adjacent non-background colors (Sources, S).\n3.  Existing non-background colors act as barriers.\n4.  Where different fills compete, the one with the lower color index takes precedence.\n\nThe critical missing piece is the rule determining *which* color is used for filling based on the adjacent source(s). The previous code's failure confirms that the source color itself is not always the fill color. Hypothesis 15, where a mapping from Source Color (S) to Fill Color (F) is inferred directly from the input-output pair, appears promising. This mapping seems specific to each task instance.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Implement code to automatically infer the Source-to-Fill (S -> F) mapping based on adjacency in the input and output grids.\n2.  Verify if this inferred map is consistent within each example and across examples.\n3.  Refine the YAML description and Natural Language Program to incorporate this map derivation step.\n4.  The flood fill logic will then use the *mapped* fill color associated with influencing neighbors, still applying the lower-index priority rule for conflicts.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (Hypothesis 15):**\n\nThe following code attempts to derive the S -> F mapping for each example. For each source color `s`, it looks at the background pixels adjacent to `s` in the input and finds the most common non-background color in the corresponding positions in the output.\n\n*code_execution:*\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Background:** Determine the most frequent pixel color in the input grid; this is the \"background color\" (BG).\n2.  **Identify Sources:** Identify all non-background colors in the input grid that are orthogonally adjacent to at least one background pixel. These are the \"source colors\" (S). Keep track of the coordinates of pixels for each source color.\n3.  **Derive Source-to-Fill Map:** Create a mapping (M) from source colors (S) to fill colors (F):\n    a.  For each source color `s`:\n        i.  Find all background pixels in the *input* grid that are orthogonally adjacent to *any* pixel of color `s`.\n        ii. Examine the colors of these corresponding pixel locations in the *output* grid.\n        iii. Collect all these output colors that are *not* the background color.\n        iv. If any such non-background output colors were collected, find the color that appears most frequently among them. If there's a tie in frequency, choose the color with the lowest numerical index.\n        v.  Add an entry to the map M, mapping the source color `s` to this chosen fill color `f`. (M[s] = f).\n4.  **Initialize Output:** Create a working copy of the input grid.\n5.  **Iterative Filling using Map:** Repeatedly iterate through the grid until no pixel changes color in a full pass:\n    a.  Create a temporary grid for the next state, copying the current working grid.\n    b.  For each pixel location `(r, c)`:\n        i.   Examine the orthogonal neighbors `(nr, nc)` in the *current* working grid.\n        ii.  Determine potential \"fill influences\" from neighbors:\n            *   If a neighbor's color `C_neighbor` is a source color `s` that has an entry in the map M, its influence is the mapped fill color `M[s]`.\n            *   If a neighbor's color `C_neighbor` is itself a fill color `f` (i.e., it's one of the values present in the map M), its influence is `f`.\n        iii. If one or more fill influences exist for pixel `(r, c)`:\n            1.  Select the \"winning fill color\" from the influences by choosing the color with the lowest numerical index (highest priority).\n            2.  Get the color currently at `(r, c)` in the *working* grid (`current_pixel_color`).\n            3.  If `current_pixel_color` is the background color, update the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *temporary* grid to the winning fill color.\n            4.  If `current_pixel_color` is *not* the background color, update the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *temporary* grid to the winning fill color *only if* the winning fill color's index is strictly less than `current_pixel_color`'s index.\n    c.  After checking all pixels, update the working grid to be the temporary grid for the next iteration.\n6.  **Final Output:** Once an iteration completes with no changes, the working grid is the final output."
