**General Assessment:**

The previous attempt using a standard priority flood fill (Hypothesis 14) failed on all examples. The transformed outputs did not resemble the expected outputs, indicating that the core assumption—that all non-background colors simply propagate themselves with index-based priority—is incorrect.

The key observations remain:
1.  A background color (BG) is filled.
2.  The filling originates from or is influenced by adjacent non-background colors (Sources, S).
3.  Existing non-background colors act as barriers.
4.  Where different fills compete, the one with the lower color index takes precedence.

The critical missing piece is the rule determining *which* color is used for filling based on the adjacent source(s). The previous code's failure confirms that the source color itself is not always the fill color. Hypothesis 15, where a mapping from Source Color (S) to Fill Color (F) is inferred directly from the input-output pair, appears promising. This mapping seems specific to each task instance.

**Strategy:**

1.  Implement code to automatically infer the Source-to-Fill (S -> F) mapping based on adjacency in the input and output grids.
2.  Verify if this inferred map is consistent within each example and across examples.
3.  Refine the YAML description and Natural Language Program to incorporate this map derivation step.
4.  The flood fill logic will then use the *mapped* fill color associated with influencing neighbors, still applying the lower-index priority rule for conflicts.

**Metrics Gathering (Hypothesis 15):**

The following code attempts to derive the S -> F mapping for each example. For each source color `s`, it looks at the background pixels adjacent to `s` in the input and finds the most common non-background color in the corresponding positions in the output.

**Metrics Analysis (Hypothesis 15):**

The metrics strongly support Hypothesis 15:

1.  **Map Inference:** The automated inference process successfully derived a Source-to-Fill (S -> F) mapping for each example.
2.  **Map Consistency:** The set of fill colors derived from the inferred map (`Inferred Fill Colors (F)`) exactly matches the set of colors observed replacing the background in the output (`Observed Fill Colors`) for all four examples.
3.  **Specific Mappings:**
    *   Ex 1: All sources {1, 2, 3} map to fill color {3}.
    *   Ex 2: Source {1} maps to {3}, Source {4} maps to {5}. Sources {3, 5} do not appear to initiate fills distinct from their neighbors' influence or their own color being overwritten/maintained. The inference only captures {1:3, 4:5}.
    *   Ex 3: Source {1} maps to {6}, Source {2} maps to {9}, Source {4} maps to {6}. Other sources don't generate distinct fills based on the adjacency analysis.
    *   Ex 4: Source {3} maps to {3}, Source {4} maps to {4}, Source {6} maps to {7}, Source {7} maps to {7}.
4.  **Conclusion:** The transformation involves identifying the background, determining a specific S->F mapping by observing which output colors replace background pixels adjacent to input source pixels, and then performing a priority flood fill using these mapped colors.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill background pixels based on adjacent source colors using iterative propagation with priority, where the fill color is determined by a mapping derived from the input-output example.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties: Contains pixels with color values 0-9.
  - type: background_pixel
    properties:
      - color: The most frequent color in the input grid (BG).
      - role: Target pixels to be replaced during the transformation.
  - type: source_pixel
    properties:
      - color: A non-background color (S) in the input grid that is orthogonally adjacent to at least one background_pixel.
      - role: Influences the color of adjacent background pixels in the output, potentially mapping to a different fill color.
      - location: Coordinates (r, c) where the source pixel exists.
  - type: fill_pixel
    properties:
      - color: A color (F) that replaces a background_pixel in the output grid. It is determined by the source_pixel(s) adjacent to the original background_pixel via a derived mapping.
      - priority: Determined by the fill color's index (lower index = higher priority).
  - type: source_fill_map
    properties:
      - type: dictionary mapping S -> F.
      - derivation: Inferred by examining, for each source color S, the output colors F that replace the background pixels originally adjacent to S. The most frequent F (with tie-breaking using the lowest F index) becomes the mapped value for S.
      - scope: Applies to the specific task instance.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: [pixel, pixel]
    properties: Orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right).
  - type: determines_fill_via_map
    from: source_pixel_color (S)
    to: fill_pixel_color (F)
    using: source_fill_map
    properties: A source pixel S influences adjacent background pixels to become color F = source_fill_map[S].
  - type: overwrites
    from: lower_index_fill_pixel or lower_index_source_pixel
    to: higher_index_fill_pixel, higher_index_source_pixel, or background_pixel
    properties: Occurs when multiple colors compete for the same pixel location during propagation; the color with the lowest index prevails.

    steps:

        - Collect list L of output colors at (r, c) for all input pixels (r, c) that were BG and adjacent to any pixel of color s.
        - Filter L to remove BG color.
        - If L is not empty:
          - Find the most frequent color(s) f in L.
          - If tied, select the f with the minimum color index.

      - Initialize working_grid = input_grid.
      - Get the set of actual fill colors F used (values in M).
      - Repeat until no changes occur in an iteration:
        - Create next_grid = copy of working_grid.
        - For each pixel (r, c):
          - Get current color `curr = working_grid[r, c]`.
          - Find potential fill influences:
            - For each orthogonal neighbor `(nr, nc)` with color `C_neighbor` in working_grid:
              - If `C_neighbor` is a source color `s` present in the input mapping `M`, the influence is `M[s]`.
              - If `C_neighbor` is already a fill color `f` (a value in `M`), the influence is `f`.
          - If influences exist:
            - Find highest priority (lowest index) influence color `f_win`.
            - If `curr == BG`:
              - Set `next_grid[r, c] = f_win`. Mark change occurred.
            - Else (`curr != BG`):
              - If `f_win < curr`: # Check priority
                - Set `next_grid[r, c] = f_win`. Mark change occurred.
        - Update `working_grid = next_grid`.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Background:** Determine the most frequent pixel color in the input grid; this is the "background color" (BG).
2.  **Identify Sources:** Identify all non-background colors in the input grid that are orthogonally adjacent to at least one background pixel. These are the "source colors" (S). Keep track of the coordinates of pixels for each source color.
3.  **Derive Source-to-Fill Map:** Create a mapping (M) from source colors (S) to fill colors (F):
    a.  For each source color `s`:
        i.  Find all background pixels in the *input* grid that are orthogonally adjacent to *any* pixel of color `s`.
        ii. Examine the colors of these corresponding pixel locations in the *output* grid.
        iii. Collect all these output colors that are *not* the background color.
        iv. If any such non-background output colors were collected, find the color that appears most frequently among them. If there's a tie in frequency, choose the color with the lowest numerical index.
        v.  Add an entry to the map M, mapping the source color `s` to this chosen fill color `f`. (M[s] = f).
4.  **Initialize Output:** Create a working copy of the input grid.
5.  **Iterative Filling using Map:** Repeatedly iterate through the grid until no pixel changes color in a full pass:
    a.  Create a temporary grid for the next state, copying the current working grid.
    b.  For each pixel location `(r, c)`:
        i.   Examine the orthogonal neighbors `(nr, nc)` in the *current* working grid.
        ii.  Determine potential "fill influences" from neighbors:
            *   If a neighbor's color `C_neighbor` is a source color `s` that has an entry in the map M, its influence is the mapped fill color `M[s]`.
            *   If a neighbor's color `C_neighbor` is itself a fill color `f` (i.e., it's one of the values present in the map M), its influence is `f`.
        iii. If one or more fill influences exist for pixel `(r, c)`:
            1.  Select the "winning fill color" from the influences by choosing the color with the lowest numerical index (highest priority).
            2.  Get the color currently at `(r, c)` in the *working* grid (`current_pixel_color`).
            3.  If `current_pixel_color` is the background color, update the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *temporary* grid to the winning fill color.
            4.  If `current_pixel_color` is *not* the background color, update the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *temporary* grid to the winning fill color *only if* the winning fill color's index is strictly less than `current_pixel_color`'s index.
    c.  After checking all pixels, update the working grid to be the temporary grid for the next iteration.
6.  **Final Output:** Once an iteration completes with no changes, the working grid is the final output.
