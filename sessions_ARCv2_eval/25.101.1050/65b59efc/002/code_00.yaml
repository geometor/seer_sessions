Input Grid:
  Structure: Contains a grid defined by gray (5) pixels, dividing the space into Cells.
  Separator Distance (S): The dimension of the cell block including the separator (e.g., 4 for 3x3 cells with 1 separator).
  Cell Size: S-1 (e.g., 3).
  Cellular Dimensions (M, N): Number of cell rows and columns derived from content bounds and S.
  Cells: Identified by row/col index (r, c). Contain Objects or are empty (background 0).
  Objects: Contiguous blocks of non-gray(5), non-background(0) pixels within a cell's boundaries. Have Shape and original Color.
  Key Row: The last row containing any non-background content holds Key Pixels.

Key Pixels:
  Properties: Have a Color (K) and an Input Grid Column Index (I).
  Function:
    - Position (I): Determines which input cell column `c = I // S` is 'active'. The first key encountered within a cell's column range activates it.
    - Color (K): The color K associated with an active column `c` contributes to determining the output color.

Transformation:
  Active Columns: Input cell columns `c` associated with a Key Pixel. An ordered list `c_active` is maintained.
  Output Columns (N'): Number of active input columns.
  Color Mapping:
    - Determine the set of unique Key Colors (UKC) associated with the active columns.
    - Based *only* on the set UKC, establish a fixed Color Map (CM). Observed maps:
        - UKC={1, 6, 7}: CM={1:6, 6:7, 7:1} (Cycle Blue->Magenta->Orange->Blue)
        - UKC={3, 7, 9}: CM={3:7, 7:3, 9:9} (Swap Green<=>Orange, Fix Maroon)
        - UKC={3, 6, 8}: CM={3:6, 6:3, 8:8} (Swap Green<=>Magenta, Fix Azure)
    - The Output Color (OC) for an object from active input column `c` (with Key Color K[c]) is `OC = CM[K[c]]`.
  Shape Mapping:
    - Determine Output Cell Size (S'): Default is S'=S. If input is 14x17 with S=4 (like train_3), then S'=6 (output cell size 5).
    - If input cell row `r > 0`: Output Shape is a solid square of size S'xS', colored with OC.
    - If input cell row `r == 0`:
        - If S' == S: Output Shape is the Input Shape, colored with OC.
        - If S' != S: Output Shape is the Input Shape scaled to S'xS' using geometric line drawing (see NL Program Step 5c-ii), colored with OC.
  Output Grid Construction:
    - Dimensions: M rows (same as input), N' columns (number of active input cols). Cell size S'xS'.
    - Placement: Object from input cell (r, c) is placed in output cell (R, C), where R=r, and C is the index of `c` in the ordered `c_active` list.

Output Grid:
  Structure: Composed of M x N' cells, each S'xS' pixels. No gray lines.
  Content: Contains the transformed objects.
