## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grids contain a prominent structure defined by gray pixels (color 5). These gray pixels form horizontal and vertical lines, effectively partitioning the grid into smaller, equally sized rectangular cells (usually 3x3 pixels).
2.  **Objects:** Within these cells (ignoring the gray borders), there are objects composed of contiguous pixels of a single color (other than gray or the background color 0). These objects often resemble simple shapes or letters/symbols.
3.  **Key/Instruction Pixels:** The last row of the input grid contains specific non-background pixels. These act as "keys" or "instructions". Their color and column position are significant.
4.  **Transformation Core Logic:** The core task seems to involve processing the objects within each input cell based on the key pixels. Objects are selected, potentially recolored, possibly reshaped, and placed into an output grid.
5.  **Key Pixel Role - Color:** The color of a key pixel in the last row determines the output color for certain objects. The mapping appears linked to the column of the input cell where the object originated. Columns without a corresponding key pixel seem to have their objects ignored.
6.  **Key Pixel Role - Position:** The column index of a key pixel determines which column(s) of input cells it influences.
7.  **Shape Transformation:** Some input shapes are preserved in the output (though potentially scaled), while others (often simple, single-pixel, or L-shapes, especially those not in the first row of cells) seem to be replaced by a default shape, specifically a solid square matching the cell size.
8.  **Filtering/Selection:** Not all objects present in the input cells necessarily appear in the output. Objects in columns without a key pixel are typically absent. Sometimes, even objects in "active" columns might be filtered (e.g., the yellow 'L' shape in `train_1`'s input cell (1,1) is missing in the output).
9.  **Output Grid Construction:** The output grid is constructed by placing the transformed (recolored, reshaped/scaled) objects into a new grid structure. The dimensions of the output grid and its cells might differ from the input (as seen in `train_3`, where 3x3 input cells scale to 5x5 output cells, and the overall grid changes). The mapping from input cell coordinates (r, c) to output cell coordinates (R, C) seems related but might involve using only the active columns.

## Facts (YAML)


```yaml
Input Grid:
  Structure: Contains a grid defined by gray (5) pixels, dividing the space into Cells.
  Cells: Typically uniform size (e.g., 3x3 pixels). Contain Objects or are empty.
  Objects: Contiguous blocks of non-gray, non-background pixels within a cell. Have Shape and original Color.
  Key Row: The last row contains Key Pixels.
Key Pixels:
  Properties: Have a Color (K) and an Input Column Index (I).
  Function: Determine which input cell columns are 'active' and provide the primary color information for transforming objects in those columns.
Transformation:
  Process: Maps objects from active input cells to output cells.
  Active Columns: Input cell columns 'c' associated with a Key Pixel based on its index I.
  Filtering: Objects in inactive input columns are typically ignored. Some objects in active columns might also be ignored based on unknown criteria.
  Recoloring: The output color of an object is determined by the Key Color K associated with its original input column `c`. (Note: the exact mapping rule, e.g., K[c] vs K[c+1] etc., needs confirmation).
  Reshaping:
    - Some input Shapes are preserved (potentially scaled).
    - Simple input shapes (e.g., dots, L-shapes) below the first row of cells are often replaced by a solid square shape matching the output cell size.
  Scaling (Observed in train_3):
    - Input cell size (e.g., 3x3) can map to a different output cell size (e.g., 5x5).
    - The shape within the cell is scaled accordingly (method TBD - not simple pixel repetition).
Output Grid:
  Structure: Composed of cells, potentially with different dimensions (M'xN') and cell sizes (S'xS') than the input.
  Content: Contains the transformed objects placed according to a mapping from input cell coordinates (r, c) to output cell coordinates (R, C). Typically R=r, and C corresponds to the relative order of the active input column `c`.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Analyze Input Structure:**
    *   Identify the gray (5) grid lines in the input.
    *   Determine the dimensions of the grid cells (e.g., 3x3) and the number of cell rows (M) and columns (N).
    *   For each cell (r, c) from (0,0) to (M-1, N-1), extract the object shape P present within it (ignoring the gray lines and background 0). If no object, mark as empty. Store the shapes with their original cell coordinates (r, c).
2.  **Identify Keys and Active Columns:**
    *   Scan the last row of the input grid for non-background pixels (Key Pixels).
    *   For each Key Pixel, record its color K and its grid column index I.
    *   Create a mapping from each input cell column index `c` (0 to N-1) to a Key Color. A column `c` maps to the color K of a Key Pixel if the Key Pixel's index I falls within the column range corresponding to cell column `c`. Mark columns associated with a key as 'active' and store their associated Key Color K[c].
3.  **Determine Output Grid Parameters:**
    *   Establish the output grid cell dimensions (M'xN') and output cell size (S'xS').
    *   Infer M' = M.
    *   Infer N' = the count of active input columns.
    *   Infer S' = S, unless specific conditions trigger scaling (like in train_3, where S'=5 when S=3 - rule TBD).
    *   Create an empty output grid based on these parameters (total size M'*S' x N'*S').
4.  **Map Active Columns:** Create an ordered list of active input column indices `c_active = [c1, c2, ...]`. The index in this list determines the output column C (e.g., `c1` maps to output C=0, `c2` maps to C=1, etc.).
5.  **Transform and Place Objects:**
    *   Iterate through each input cell coordinate (r, c) from (0,0) to (M-1, N-1).
    *   If the input cell contains an object shape P AND its column `c` is in the `c_active` list:
        a.  **Determine Output Color:** Get the Key Color K = K[c] associated with the active input column `c`.
        b.  **Determine Output Shape:**
            i.  Check if the input shape P is a 'simple' shape (e.g., single pixel, possibly L-shape) AND if the input row `r` > 0.
            ii. If both conditions are true, the output shape P' is a solid square of size S'xS'.
            iii. Otherwise, the output shape P' is the input shape P, potentially scaled from SxS to S'xS' using a specific scaling algorithm (to be defined if S' != S).
        c.  **Determine Output Position:** The output cell row R is `r`. Find the index `idx` of `c` within the `c_active` list. The output cell column C is `idx`.
        d.  **Draw:** Place the output shape P' into the output grid within the cell (R, C), using the determined output color K.
6.  **Return Output:** The final constructed grid is the result.
