Input Grid:
  Structure: Contains a grid defined by gray (5) pixels, dividing the space into Cells.
  Cells: Typically uniform size (e.g., 3x3 pixels). Contain Objects or are empty.
  Objects: Contiguous blocks of non-gray, non-background pixels within a cell. Have Shape and original Color.
  Key Row: The last row contains Key Pixels.
Key Pixels:
  Properties: Have a Color (K) and an Input Column Index (I).
  Function: Determine which input cell columns are 'active' and provide the primary color information for transforming objects in those columns.
Transformation:
  Process: Maps objects from active input cells to output cells.
  Active Columns: Input cell columns 'c' associated with a Key Pixel based on its index I.
  Filtering: Objects in inactive input columns are typically ignored. Some objects in active columns might also be ignored based on unknown criteria.
  Recoloring: The output color of an object is determined by the Key Color K associated with its original input column `c`. (Note: the exact mapping rule, e.g., K[c] vs K[c+1] etc., needs confirmation).
  Reshaping:
    - Some input Shapes are preserved (potentially scaled).
    - Simple input shapes (e.g., dots, L-shapes) below the first row of cells are often replaced by a solid square shape matching the output cell size.
  Scaling (Observed in train_3):
    - Input cell size (e.g., 3x3) can map to a different output cell size (e.g., 5x5).
    - The shape within the cell is scaled accordingly (method TBD - not simple pixel repetition).
Output Grid:
  Structure: Composed of cells, potentially with different dimensions (M'xN') and cell sizes (S'xS') than the input.
  Content: Contains the transformed objects placed according to a mapping from input cell coordinates (r, c) to output cell coordinates (R, C). Typically R=r, and C corresponds to the relative order of the active input column `c`.
