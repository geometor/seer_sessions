## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grids contain a prominent structure defined by gray pixels (color 5). These gray pixels form horizontal and vertical lines, effectively partitioning the grid into smaller, equally sized rectangular cells (usually 3x3 pixels).
2.  **Objects:** Within these cells (ignoring the gray borders), there are objects composed of contiguous pixels of a single color (other than gray or the background color 0). These objects often resemble simple shapes or letters/symbols.
3.  **Key/Instruction Pixels:** The last row of the input grid contains specific non-background pixels. These act as "keys" or "instructions". Their color and column position are significant.
4.  **Transformation Core Logic:** The core task seems to involve processing the objects within each input cell based on the key pixels. Objects are selected, potentially recolored, possibly reshaped, and placed into an output grid.
5.  **Key Pixel Role - Color:** The color of a key pixel in the last row determines the output color for certain objects. The mapping appears linked to the column of the input cell where the object originated. Columns without a corresponding key pixel seem to have their objects ignored.
6.  **Key Pixel Role - Position:** The column index of a key pixel determines which column(s) of input cells it influences.
7.  **Shape Transformation:** Some input shapes are preserved in the output (though potentially scaled), while others (often simple, single-pixel, or L-shapes, especially those not in the first row of cells) seem to be replaced by a default shape, specifically a solid square matching the cell size.
8.  **Filtering/Selection:** Not all objects present in the input cells necessarily appear in the output. Objects in columns without a key pixel are typically absent. Sometimes, even objects in "active" columns might be filtered (e.g., the yellow 'L' shape in `train_1`'s input cell (1,1) is missing in the output).
9.  **Output Grid Construction:** The output grid is constructed by placing the transformed (recolored, reshaped/scaled) objects into a new grid structure. The dimensions of the output grid and its cells might differ from the input (as seen in `train_3`, where 3x3 input cells scale to 5x5 output cells, and the overall grid changes). The mapping from input cell coordinates (r, c) to output cell coordinates (R, C) seems related but might involve using only the active columns.

## Facts (YAML)


```yaml
Input Grid:
  Structure: Contains a grid defined by gray (5) pixels, dividing the space into Cells.
  Cells: Typically uniform size (e.g., 3x3 pixels). Contain Objects or are empty.
  Objects: Contiguous blocks of non-gray, non-background pixels within a cell. Have Shape and original Color.
  Key Row: The last row contains Key Pixels.
Key Pixels:
  Properties: Have a Color (K) and an Input Column Index (I).
  Function: Determine which input cell columns are 'active' and provide the primary color information for transforming objects in those columns.
Transformation:
  Process: Maps objects from active input cells to output cells.
  Active Columns: Input cell columns 'c' associated with a Key Pixel based on its index I.
  Filtering: Objects in inactive input columns are typically ignored. Some objects in active columns might also be ignored based on unknown criteria.
  Recoloring: The output color of an object is determined by the Key Color K associated with its original input column `c`. (Note: the exact mapping rule, e.g., K[c] vs K[c+1] etc., needs confirmation).
  Reshaping:
    - Some input Shapes are preserved (potentially scaled).
    - Simple input shapes (e.g., dots, L-shapes) below the first row of cells are often replaced by a solid square shape matching the output cell size.
  Scaling (Observed in train_3):
    - Input cell size (e.g., 3x3) can map to a different output cell size (e.g., 5x5).
    - The shape within the cell is scaled accordingly (method TBD - not simple pixel repetition).
Output Grid:
  Structure: Composed of cells, potentially with different dimensions (M'xN') and cell sizes (S'xS') than the input.
  Content: Contains the transformed objects placed according to a mapping from input cell coordinates (r, c) to output cell coordinates (R, C). Typically R=r, and C corresponds to the relative order of the active input column `c`.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Analyze Input Structure:**
    *   Identify the gray (5) grid lines in the input.
    *   Determine the dimensions of the grid cells (e.g., 3x3) and the number of cell rows (M) and columns (N).
    *   For each cell (r, c) from (0,0) to (M-1, N-1), extract the object shape P present within it (ignoring the gray lines and background 0). If no object, mark as empty. Store the shapes with their original cell coordinates (r, c).
2.  **Identify Keys and Active Columns:**
    *   Scan the last row of the input grid for non-background pixels (Key Pixels).
    *   For each Key Pixel, record its color K and its grid column index I.
    *   Create a mapping from each input cell column index `c` (0 to N-1) to a Key Color. A column `c` maps to the color K of a Key Pixel if the Key Pixel's index I falls within the column range corresponding to cell column `c`. Mark columns associated with a key as 'active' and store their associated Key Color K[c].
3.  **Determine Output Grid Parameters:**
    *   Establish the output grid cell dimensions (M'xN') and output cell size (S'xS').
    *   Infer M' = M.
    *   Infer N' = the count of active input columns.
    *   Infer S' = S, unless specific conditions trigger scaling (like in train_3, where S'=5 when S=3 - rule TBD).
    *   Create an empty output grid based on these parameters (total size M'*S' x N'*S').
4.  **Map Active Columns:** Create an ordered list of active input column indices `c_active = [c1, c2, ...]`. The index in this list determines the output column C (e.g., `c1` maps to output C=0, `c2` maps to C=1, etc.).
5.  **Transform and Place Objects:**
    *   Iterate through each input cell coordinate (r, c) from (0,0) to (M-1, N-1).
    *   If the input cell contains an object shape P AND its column `c` is in the `c_active` list:
        a.  **Determine Output Color:** Get the Key Color K = K[c] associated with the active input column `c`.
        b.  **Determine Output Shape:**
            i.  Check if the input shape P is a 'simple' shape (e.g., single pixel, possibly L-shape) AND if the input row `r` > 0.
            ii. If both conditions are true, the output shape P' is a solid square of size S'xS'.
            iii. Otherwise, the output shape P' is the input shape P, potentially scaled from SxS to S'xS' using a specific scaling algorithm (to be defined if S' != S).
        c.  **Determine Output Position:** The output cell row R is `r`. Find the index `idx` of `c` within the `c_active` list. The output cell column C is `idx`.
        d.  **Draw:** Place the output shape P' into the output grid within the cell (R, C), using the determined output color K.
6.  **Return Output:** The final constructed grid is the result.

Okay, the previous code failed to produce any output, indicating a fundamental issue in the initial steps like grid analysis or key identification, or perhaps an incorrect return condition. Let's re-evaluate based on the examples and failed results.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

1.  **Core Failure:** The code returned empty grids (`[]`). This likely means either `find_grid_params` failed to identify the grid structure (returning `None`), `find_keys_and_active_columns` found no active columns, or the calculated output dimensions were zero. Given the inputs have clear structures and keys, the implementation of these helper functions needs review, especially edge case handling.
2.  **Color Transformation Logic:** The initial assumption that the key color directly becomes the output color was incorrect. Analysis across examples reveals a more complex mapping:
    *   The *set* of unique key colors found in the last relevant row determines a specific color transformation rule (e.g., a cycle, swaps, fixed points).
    *   The key color associated with an active input column `c` is looked up in this transformation rule map to determine the final output color for objects from that column.
3.  **Shape Transformation Logic:** The rule for when a shape is replaced by a solid square needs refinement. The condition `r > 0` (input cell row is not the first) seems to consistently trigger the square replacement, regardless of the original shape's complexity. Shapes in the first row (`r == 0`) are preserved.
4.  **Scaling:** Example 3 demonstrates scaling (input 3x3 cells -> output 5x5 cells). The previous code used a placeholder. A proper scaling algorithm is needed, likely involving mapping original pixel coordinates to the new cell size and drawing lines between adjacent points.
5.  **Strategy:**
    *   Debug the helper functions (`find_grid_params`, `find_keys_and_active_columns`) to ensure they correctly parse the input structure and keys for all examples.
    *   Implement the logic to determine the color mapping based on the *set* of key colors. This requires identifying the specific rules for the observed sets ({1,6,7}, {3,7,9}, {3,6,8}) and potentially generalizing.
    *   Implement the revised shape transformation rule (`r > 0` -> square, `r == 0` -> preserve/scale).
    *   Implement the geometric scaling algorithm (map points, draw lines).

**Metrics**

**Error Analysis of Metrics:** The metrics calculation failed dramatically. It identified S=1 and cell\_size=0, treating each pixel as a cell. This is incorrect. The logic for finding `S` in the `analyze_example` function was oversimplified and flawed, likely because it only looked at the *first* gray row/column index instead of the *distance* between them or the pattern `content, gray, content, gray...`. My manual analysis (S=4, cell\_size=3 for T1/T2; S=4, cell\_size=3 for T3 input) seems correct. The key mapping calculation was also wrong because it relied on the incorrect S=1.

Let's proceed with the manually derived parameters and the revised logic.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
Input Grid:
  Structure: Contains a grid defined by gray (5) pixels, dividing the space into Cells.
  Separator Distance (S): The dimension of the cell block including the separator (e.g., 4 for 3x3 cells with 1 separator).
  Cell Size: S-1 (e.g., 3).
  Cellular Dimensions (M, N): Number of cell rows and columns derived from content bounds and S.
  Cells: Identified by row/col index (r, c). Contain Objects or are empty (background 0).
  Objects: Contiguous blocks of non-gray(5), non-background(0) pixels within a cell's boundaries. Have Shape and original Color.
  Key Row: The last row containing any non-background content holds Key Pixels.

Key Pixels:
  Properties: Have a Color (K) and an Input Grid Column Index (I).
  Function:
    - Position (I): Determines which input cell column `c = I // S` is 'active'. The first key encountered within a cell's column range activates it.
    - Color (K): The color K associated with an active column `c` contributes to determining the output color.

Transformation:
  Active Columns: Input cell columns `c` associated with a Key Pixel. An ordered list `c_active` is maintained.
  Output Columns (N'): Number of active input columns.
  Color Mapping:
    - Determine the set of unique Key Colors (UKC) associated with the active columns.
    - Based *only* on the set UKC, establish a fixed Color Map (CM). Observed maps:
        - UKC={1, 6, 7}: CM={1:6, 6:7, 7:1} (Cycle Blue->Magenta->Orange->Blue)
        - UKC={3, 7, 9}: CM={3:7, 7:3, 9:9} (Swap Green<=>Orange, Fix Maroon)
        - UKC={3, 6, 8}: CM={3:6, 6:3, 8:8} (Swap Green<=>Magenta, Fix Azure)
    - The Output Color (OC) for an object from active input column `c` (with Key Color K[c]) is `OC = CM[K[c]]`.
  Shape Mapping:
    - Determine Output Cell Size (S'): Default is S'=S. If input is 14x17 with S=4 (like train_3), then S'=6 (output cell size 5).
    - If input cell row `r > 0`: Output Shape is a solid square of size S'xS', colored with OC.
    - If input cell row `r == 0`:
        - If S' == S: Output Shape is the Input Shape, colored with OC.
        - If S' != S: Output Shape is the Input Shape scaled to S'xS' using geometric line drawing (see NL Program Step 5c-ii), colored with OC.
  Output Grid Construction:
    - Dimensions: M rows (same as input), N' columns (number of active input cols). Cell size S'xS'.
    - Placement: Object from input cell (r, c) is placed in output cell (R, C), where R=r, and C is the index of `c` in the ordered `c_active` list.

Output Grid:
  Structure: Composed of M x N' cells, each S'xS' pixels. No gray lines.
  Content: Contains the transformed objects.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Analyze Input Structure:**
    *   Identify the gray (5) pixel grid pattern to determine the separator distance `S` (e.g., distance between consecutive horizontal/vertical gray lines + 1) and the input cell size (`cell_size = S - 1`).
    *   Determine the number of input cell rows (M) and columns (N) based on the extent of non-background content and `S`.
    *   For each input cell coordinate (r, c) from (0,0) to (M-1, N-1), extract the shape pattern (non-background, non-gray pixels) within the `cell_size` x `cell_size` boundaries, storing it as `InputShape[r, c]`. Mark empty cells.
2.  **Identify Keys, Active Columns, and Key Colors:**
    *   Find the last row index (`key_row_idx`) containing any non-background pixels.
    *   Scan `InputGrid[key_row_idx, :]` for non-background pixels (Key Pixels).
    *   Create an empty map `KeyColorMap` `{c: K}` and an empty ordered list `ActiveColumns`.
    *   For each Key Pixel with color `K` at grid index `I`:
        *   Calculate the corresponding input cell column `c = I // S`.
        *   If `c < N` and `c` is not already in `KeyColorMap`: Add `c` to `ActiveColumns`, and store `KeyColorMap[c] = K`.
    *   Sort `ActiveColumns` numerically.
3.  **Determine Color Transformation Map:**
    *   Create a set `UniqueKeyColors` containing all values `K` from `KeyColorMap`.
    *   Define the `FinalColorMap` based on `UniqueKeyColors`:
        *   If `UniqueKeyColors == {1, 6, 7}`, `FinalColorMap = {1:6, 6:7, 7:1}`.
        *   If `UniqueKeyColors == {3, 7, 9}`, `FinalColorMap = {3:7, 7:3, 9:9}`.
        *   If `UniqueKeyColors == {3, 6, 8}`, `FinalColorMap = {3:6, 6:3, 8:8}`.
        *   (Add rules for other potential sets if encountered).
4.  **Determine Output Grid Parameters:**
    *   Set Output Cell Rows `M' = M`.
    *   Set Output Cell Columns `N' = length(ActiveColumns)`.
    *   Set Output Cell Size `output_cell_size`. Default is `input_cell_size`.
        *   *Exception*: If Input Grid is 14x17 and `S == 4`, set `output_cell_size = 5`.
    *   Calculate output grid dimensions: `H_out = M' * output_cell_size`, `W_out = N' * output_cell_size`.
    *   Create an empty output grid (`OutputGrid`) of size `H_out x W_out` filled with background color (0).
5.  **Transform and Place Objects:**
    *   Initialize Output Cell Column index `C = 0`.
    *   For each input cell column `c` in `ActiveColumns`:
        *   Get the original Key Color `K = KeyColorMap[c]`.
        *   Determine the mapped Output Color `OC = FinalColorMap[K]`.
        *   For each input cell row `r` from 0 to M-1:
            *   If `InputShape[r, c]` exists (cell is not empty):
                a.  **Determine Output Shape:**
                    i.  If `r > 0`: `OutputShape` is a solid square of size `output_cell_size` x `output_cell_size` filled with color `OC`.
                    ii. If `r == 0`:
                        *   If `output_cell_size == input_cell_size`: `OutputShape` is `InputShape[r, c]` where all non-zero pixels are replaced with `OC`.
                        *   If `output_cell_size != input_cell_size` (scaling):
                            1. Create an empty `OutputShape` of size `output_cell_size` x `output_cell_size`.
                            2. Map the coordinates `(r_in, c_in)` of each non-zero pixel in `InputShape[r, c]` (relative to the input cell, 0 to `input_cell_size`-1) to scaled coordinates `(r_out, c_out)` (relative to the output cell, 0 to `output_cell_size`-1) using `coord_out = round(coord_in * (output_cell_size - 1) / (input_cell_size - 1))`. Mark these `(r_out, c_out)` pixels in `OutputShape` with color `OC`. Store these mapped points.
                            3. Iterate through all pairs of non-zero pixels `p1, p2` in `InputShape[r, c]` that are adjacent (4-connectivity). Find their corresponding mapped points `p1', p2'` in `OutputShape`. Draw a straight line (bresenham or similar) between `p1'` and `p2'` in `OutputShape`, filling the pixels with color `OC`.
                b.  **Place in Output Grid:** Calculate the top-left corner `(R_start, C_start) = (r * output_cell_size, C * output_cell_size)`. Copy the `OutputShape` into the `OutputGrid` at this position.
        *   Increment `C`.
6.  **Return Output:** Return the final `OutputGrid`.
