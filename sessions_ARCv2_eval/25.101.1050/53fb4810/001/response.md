"""
Transformation Rule:
Locates an adjacent (including diagonal) pair of Red (2) and Yellow (4) pixels.
Identifies the column containing the Yellow pixel as the target column.
Determines a stop row by finding the first non-background (Azure 8) pixel in the target column below the Yellow pixel's row. If no such pixel exists, the stop row is the grid height.
Determines the starting color for a pattern: If the Red pixel is in the target column and below the Yellow pixel, the pattern starts with Red (2), otherwise it starts with Yellow (4).
Fills the target column from row 0 up to (but not including) the stop row with an alternating pattern of Red (2) and Yellow (4), beginning with the determined starting color.
All other pixels remain unchanged.
