task_description: Modifies a specific column by drawing an alternating vertical pattern based on the location and relative position of an adjacent Red and Yellow pixel pair.
grid_properties:
  background_color: 8 # Azure
  static_elements: True # Most pixels/objects remain unchanged.
triggering_condition:
  type: adjacent_pixel_pair
  colors: [2, 4] # Red and Yellow
  adjacency: 8-connectivity # includes diagonals
  uniqueness: Assumed to be unique per grid based on examples.
target_selection:
  based_on: trigger_pixel
  color: 4 # Yellow
  property: column_index
modification:
  type: column_fill
  area: target_column
  vertical_range:
    start_row: 0
    end_row_exclusive: Determined by the row index of the highest non-background pixel below the trigger Yellow pixel in the target column.
  pattern:
    type: alternating_colors
    colors: [2, 4] # Red and Yellow
    start_color_rule:
      condition_1: # Red is in the target column and below Yellow
        if_red_in_target_col: True
        if_red_y > yellow_y: True
        start_color: 2 # Red
      condition_2: # Default / Fallback (Red above Yellow in target col, or Red not in target col)
        start_color: 4 # Yellow
unchanged_elements:
  - background pixels (color 8)
  - all pixels outside the target column
  - pixels in the target column at or below the calculated end row
