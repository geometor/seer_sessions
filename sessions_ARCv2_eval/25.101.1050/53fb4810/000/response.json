These objects appear unchanged in the output.\n3.  **Trigger Pixels:** The key elements driving the transformation are isolated pixels of Red (2) and Yellow (4). Specifically, the trigger appears to be a pair of Red(2) and Yellow(4) pixels that are adjacent to each other (including diagonally).\n4.  **Target Column:** The column containing the Yellow (4) pixel from the trigger pair becomes the target for modification.\n5.  **Modification:** A vertical pattern is drawn in the target column.\n6.  **Pattern Colors:** The pattern consists of alternating Red (2) and Yellow (4) pixels.\n7.  **Pattern Extent:** The pattern starts from the top row (row 0) and extends downwards, stopping just before the first non-background pixel encountered in the target column *below* the original position of the trigger Yellow(4) pixel.\n8.  **Pattern Start:** The starting color of the alternating pattern (at row 0) depends on the relative position of the trigger Red(2) and Yellow(4) pixels. If Red(2) is in the same column as Yellow(4) and is positioned below it, the pattern starts with Red(2). Otherwise (if Red(2) is above Yellow(4) in the same column, or if Red(2) is in a different column), the pattern starts with Yellow(4).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Scan the input grid to locate a Yellow (4) pixel and a Red (2) pixel that are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). Record their coordinates: `(y_yellow, x_yellow)` and `(y_red, x_red)`.\n3.  Identify the target column for modification: `target_col = x_yellow`.\n4.  Determine the vertical extent of the modification:\n    a.  Initialize `stop_row` to the height of the grid.\n    b.  Iterate through the rows `r` from `y_yellow + 1` to the bottom of the grid.\n    c.  If a pixel at `(r, target_col)` is found that is not the background color (Azure 8), set `stop_row = r` and break the loop.\n    d.  The modification will apply to rows `0` through `stop_row - 1`.\n5.  Determine the starting color `C_start` and the alternating color `C_alt` for the pattern:\n    a.  If the Red pixel is in the same column as the Yellow pixel (`x_red == target_col`):\n        i.  If the Red pixel is below the Yellow pixel (`y_red > y_yellow`), set `C_start = 2` (Red) and `C_alt = 4` (Yellow).\n        ii. Else (Red pixel is above Yellow pixel), set `C_start = 4` (Yellow) and `C_alt = 2` (Red).\n    b.

Iterate through rows `r` from `0` to `stop_row - 1`.\n    b.  If `r` is even, set the pixel at `(r, target_col)` to `C_start`.\n    c.  If `r` is odd, set the pixel at `(r, target_col)` to `C_alt`.\n7.  Return the modified output grid."
