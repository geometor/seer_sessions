task_description: Extract and compact all non-white objects from the input grid into a smaller output grid.

elements:
  - element: background
    color: 0
    role: empty space, separator
  - element: object
    definition: contiguous block of non-white pixels (colors 1-9)
    properties:
      - color
      - shape
      - position (row, col)
      - bounding_box
    role: content to be extracted

actions:
  - action: find_bounding_box
    input: input_grid
    target: all non-white pixels
    output: coordinates (r_min, c_min, r_max, c_max) defining the minimal rectangle containing all target pixels
  - action: crop_grid
    input: input_grid, bounding_box coordinates
    output: subgrid containing the content within the bounding box
  - action: filter_rows
    input: grid
    condition: row contains at least one non-white pixel
    output: grid containing only rows that meet the condition
  - action: filter_columns
    input: grid
    condition: column contains at least one non-white pixel
    output: grid containing only columns that meet the condition

transformation_sequence:
  - step: 1
    action: find_bounding_box
    description: Determine the overall bounding box of all non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - step: 2
    action: crop_grid
    description: Extract the subgrid defined by the bounding box.
  - step: 3
    action: filter_rows
    description: Remove all rows from the subgrid that consist entirely of the background color (0).
  - step: 4
    action: filter_columns
    description: From the result of step 3, remove all columns that consist entirely of the background color (0).
  - step: 5
    action: output_result
    description: The final grid after row and column filtering is the task output.
