Okay, let's analyze the task examples provided.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input:** Each input grid is a 20x20 area, largely composed of white background (color 0). Scattered within the input grid are several distinct "objects," which are contiguous blocks of non-white pixels (colors 1-9). In the examples, there seem to be typically four main object areas, sometimes composed of multiple adjacent colors (like gray 5 and orange 7 often appearing together).
2.  **Output:** The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid and appears densely packed with colors. The colors present in the output grid correspond directly to the colors of the objects found in the input grid. The white background is entirely absent in the output.
3.  **Relationship:** The output grid seems to represent a "compressed" or "cropped" view of the input grid, focusing only on the areas containing objects. The relative spatial arrangement of the input objects appears roughly preserved in the output, but the empty white space between them is removed.

**Key Observations & Hypothesized Transformation:**

1.  **Object Preservation:** All non-white pixels from the input seem to be candidates for inclusion in the output.
2.  **Spatial Compression:** The core transformation involves removing empty space (white pixels).
3.  **Bounding Box:** The first step likely involves identifying the minimal bounding box that encompasses *all* non-white pixels in the input grid.
4.  **Cropping:** The input grid is conceptually cropped to this bounding box.
5.  **Compaction:** Within this cropped subgrid, rows and columns that contain *only* white (0) pixels are removed.
    *   First, all rows containing only white pixels are removed.
    *   Then, in the resulting grid, all columns containing only white pixels are removed.
6.  **Final Output:** The resulting compacted grid, containing only the original non-white pixels and potentially some white pixels that shared a row/column with non-white pixels within the bounding box, forms the output. *Correction*: Based on the examples showing *no* white pixels in the output, the compaction must remove *all* white pixels effectively, meaning only the original non-white pixels form the output, arranged according to the row/column removal process.

**Example Walkthrough (Conceptual - `train_1`):**

1.  Identify all non-white pixels in the 20x20 input.
2.  Determine their minimum and maximum row and column indices. Let's say they span from `r_min` to `r_max` and `c_min` to `c_max`.
3.  Extract the subgrid `input[r_min : r_max+1, c_min : c_max+1]`.
4.  Create a list of rows to keep: Iterate through the rows of the subgrid. If a row contains at least one non-white pixel, mark it for keeping.
5.  Create a temporary grid containing only the kept rows.
6.  Create a list of columns to keep: Iterate through the columns of the temporary grid. If a column contains at least one non-white pixel, mark it for keeping.
7.  Create the final output grid by selecting only the kept columns from the temporary grid.

*(Self-Correction during thought process: Initial analysis suggested this crop-and-compact method resulted in a 12x10 grid for train_1, while the output is 6x6. This indicates the hypothesis might be incomplete or incorrect. However, it's the most plausible explanation based on visual inspection of preserving object shapes and relative positions while removing whitespace. Another strong observation was the gray pixel (5) consistently mapping to output[0,0], and output sizes correlating in 2/3 cases with `max(H,W)*2` of the gray object's bounding box, but the mapping logic failed under testing. Given the instructions, I will proceed with the crop-and-compact hypothesis as the most likely, despite the size mismatch in my manual check, acknowledging it needs careful implementation and verification by the coder).*

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the location of all non-white pixels in the input grid.
2.  Determine the minimum row (`r_min`), maximum row (`r_max`), minimum column (`c_min`), and maximum column (`c_max`) occupied by any non-white pixel. This defines the overall bounding box.
3.  Create a temporary grid by cropping the input grid from `r_min` to `r_max` (inclusive) and `c_min` to `c_max` (inclusive).
4.  Create a new grid by iterating through the rows of the temporary grid and including only those rows that contain at least one non-white pixel.
5.  Create the final output grid by iterating through the columns of the grid generated in step 4 and including only those columns that contain at least one non-white pixel.
6.  Return the final grid.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code based on the "crop and filter empty rows/columns" hypothesis failed because it did not correctly implement the compaction aspect of the transformation. The outputs retained background pixels and had incorrect dimensions. The analysis of the failed results, combined with metrics gathered using code execution, revealed a crucial pattern: the number of non-white pixels is conserved between input and output, and the output grid is always a square whose side length is the square root of this count. This points towards a transformation that extracts *only* the non-white pixels within their bounding box and reshapes them into the target square grid.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

The strategy is to implement the revised hypothesis:
1.  Find all non-white pixels and count them (`N`).
2.  Calculate the output grid side length (`S = sqrt(N)`).
3.  Determine the bounding box of the non-white pixels.
4.  Extract the non-white pixels from the input grid *within the bounding box*, reading them row by row, left to right, to form a 1D sequence.
5.  Reshape this 1D sequence into an `S x S` grid.

**Metrics:**
