task_description: Rearrange non-background pixels from the input into a square output grid, anchored by the gray (5) pixel.

elements:
  - element: background
    color: 0
    role: empty space, ignored
  - element: non_background_pixel
    definition: Any pixel with color 1-9
    properties:
      - color
      - position (row, col)
      - count: N (total number of non_background_pixels)
    role: content to be rearranged
  - element: anchor_pixel
    definition: The unique pixel with color 5 (gray)
    properties:
      - position: (ar, ac)
    role: reference point for rearrangement; mapped to output (0,0)
  - element: output_grid
    properties:
      - shape: S x S, where S = sqrt(N). (N is always a perfect square in examples).
      - content: A permutation of the non_background_pixels from the input.
      - anchor_mapping: The input anchor_pixel's color (5) is always placed at output_grid[0, 0].

actions:
  - action: count_non_background_pixels
    input: input_grid
    output: count N
  - action: calculate_output_size
    input: N
    output: side length S = sqrt(N)
  - action: find_anchor_pixel
    input: input_grid
    output: position (ar, ac) of the gray pixel (5)
  - action: collect_pixel_sequence
    input: input_grid, anchor_position (ar, ac)
    output: ordered list P containing N non_background_pixels.
    details:
      - The first element P[0] is always 5 (anchor color).
      - The subsequent N-1 elements P[1:] are the colors of the other non-background pixels from the input.
      - The order of P[1:] is determined by a specific but unidentified rule based on the spatial relationship of input pixels relative to the anchor (ar, ac). It is not a simple row/column scan or direct relative position mapping.
  - action: reshape_sequence
    input: ordered list P, size S
    output: S x S grid by filling row-major.

transformation_sequence:
  - step: 1
    action: count_non_background_pixels
    description: Count the total number (N) of pixels in the input grid that are not background (color 0).
  - step: 2
    action: calculate_output_size
    description: Calculate the side length S of the output square grid as the integer square root of N. (N is confirmed to be a perfect square in all training examples).
  - step: 3
    action: find_anchor_pixel
    description: Locate the unique gray pixel (color 5) in the input grid at position (ar, ac).
  - step: 4
    action: collect_pixel_sequence
    description: Create an ordered sequence P of N pixel values. Start with P = [5]. Then, append the values of the remaining N-1 non-background input pixels according to an unknown spatial ordering rule relative to the anchor position (ar, ac).
  - step: 5
    action: reshape_sequence
    description: Reshape the sequence P of N pixels into an S x S grid, filling row by row. This grid is the task output.

uncertainties:
  - The precise rule for ordering the N-1 non-anchor pixels in step 4 remains the key unknown. The metrics show simple geometric relationships (like relative coordinate ranges) do not directly determine the output structure or order. The rule likely involves a more complex scan pattern or object-based processing relative to the anchor.
