            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code attempted two main hypotheses:\n1.  **Crop and Compact:** Cropping the input to the bounding box of non-white pixels and removing empty rows/columns. This failed as the resulting dimensions and content did not match the expected outputs.\n2.  **Extract and Reshape (Row-Major):** Extracting all non-white pixels (either from the bounding box or the whole grid) in row-major order and reshaping them into a square grid of size S x S, where S*S is the count of non-white pixels (N). This produced grids of the correct size (for Ex1, Ex2) and with the correct pixels, but arranged in the wrong order.\n\nA key observation from the metrics is that for Example 3, the number of non-white pixels in the input (N=15) does not match the number of pixels in the output grid (4x4=16). This suggests either a pixel is added/duplicated, or the rule for determining output size and content might differ when N is not a perfect square.\n\nThe most consistent feature across examples is that the unique gray pixel (color 5) in the input always maps to the top-left corner `[0,0]` of the output grid. The overall transformation preserves the set of non-white colors (except for the extra pixel in Ex3) but significantly rearranges their spatial configuration. The exact mechanism for this rearrangement (the order in which pixels are selected/placed) remains elusive after testing several hypotheses (scanning relative to the anchor, object-based processing, grid mapping/resampling).\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\nGiven the consistent failure to match the pixel arrangement, the focus must be on determining the correct *order* in which the non-white input pixels are mapped to the output grid sequence before reshaping. The gray pixel's position at output[0,0] is a strong hint. The process might involve:\n1.  Identifying the gray pixel (5) as an anchor.\n2.  Collecting all non-white pixels `N` from the input.\n3.  Determining the output size `S x S` (likely `S = ceil(sqrt(N))`).\n4.  Generating a sequence of `S*S` pixels: Start with the gray pixel (5). The subsequent `N-1` pixels are the remaining non-white input pixels, collected in an unknown order (possibly related to position relative to the anchor, object structure, or another geometric property). If `S*S > N`, the sequence is padded with `S*S - N` pixels (potentially gray, or the color of the smallest/least frequent object, like red in Ex3).\n5.  Reshaping the `S*S` sequence into the `S x S` grid.\n\nThe core difficulty lies in defining the \"unknown order\" in step 4. Further analysis would require testing more complex ordering strategies (e.g., spiral scan from anchor, distance-based sorting, object-by-object flattening based on anchor proximity).\n\n**Metrics:**\n"
