task_description: Rearrange non-background pixels from the input into a square output grid.

elements:
  - element: background
    color: 0
    role: empty space, ignored
  - element: non_background_pixel
    definition: Any pixel with color 1-9
    properties:
      - color
      - position (row, col)
    role: content to be rearranged
  - element: anchor_pixel
    definition: The unique pixel with color 5 (gray)
    properties:
      - position (row, col)
    role: determines starting point or reference for rearrangement
  - element: output_grid
    properties:
      - shape: S x S, where S = sqrt(N) and N is the total count of non_background_pixels in the input.
      - content: A permutation of the non_background_pixels from the input.
      - anchor_mapping: The input anchor_pixel's color (5) is always placed at output_grid[0, 0].

actions:
  - action: count_non_background_pixels
    input: input_grid
    output: count N
  - action: calculate_output_size
    input: N
    output: side length S = sqrt(N)
  - action: find_anchor_pixel
    input: input_grid
    output: position (r_a, c_a) of the gray pixel (5)
  - action: collect_non_background_pixels
    input: input_grid
    output: ordered list P containing N non_background_pixels. The ordering mechanism is the primary unknown but starts with the anchor pixel's color.
  - action: reshape_list
    input: ordered list P, size S
    output: S x S grid

transformation_sequence:
  - step: 1
    action: count_non_background_pixels
    description: Count the total number (N) of pixels in the input grid that are not background (color 0).
  - step: 2
    action: calculate_output_size
    description: Calculate the side length S of the output square grid as the integer square root of N.
  - step: 3
    action: find_anchor_pixel
    description: Locate the unique gray pixel (color 5) in the input grid.
  - step: 4
    action: collect_non_background_pixels
    description: Create a sequence P of pixel values. The first element is 5 (the anchor pixel color). The remaining N-1 elements are the other non-background pixel values from the input, gathered in a specific, currently undetermined order relative to the anchor pixel or input structure.
  - step: 5
    action: reshape_list
    description: Reshape the sequence P of N pixels into an S x S grid. This grid is the task output.

uncertainties:
  - The precise rule for ordering the non-anchor pixels in step 4 is not determined from the examples. It is not simple row-major order relative to the grid, bounding box, or anchor row. It might involve proximity, object structure, or other geometric relationships relative to the anchor pixel.
