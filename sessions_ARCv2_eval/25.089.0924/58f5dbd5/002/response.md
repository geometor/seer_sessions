Okay, the exact 3x3 patterns required for the output frame interiors are **not** present anywhere in the input grid for Example 1. This rules out simple copying.

What if the pattern is derived from the *non-solid* shape of the *same color*?

**Example 1 Revisited:**
*   Target solid shapes: Blue(1), Magenta(6), Yellow(4).
*   Non-solid shapes containing these colors:
    *   Blue(1) shape at (4,0): Contains a frame of 1s. Inner 3x3 is `[[1,1,1],[8,1,8],[1,1,1]]`.
    *   Magenta(6) shape at (14,0): Contains a frame of 6s. Inner 3x3 is `[[8,6,6],[6,8,8],[8,8,5]]`.
    *   Yellow(4) shape at (0,0): Contains a 'frame' but it's not solid Yellow. Top-left 3x3 is `[[4,4,4],[4,8,4],[4,8,4]]`.

Could the inner pattern of the output be derived by taking the inner pattern of the corresponding non-solid input shape and replacing any non-frame color pixels with the background color?

*   **Blue:** Source inner pattern `[[1,1,1],[8,1,8],[1,1,1]]`. Frame color is 1. Background is 8. Replace non-1 pixels with 8 -> `[[1,1,1],[8,1,8],[1,1,1]]`. Still doesn't match expected `[[8,8,8],[1,8,1],[8,8,8]]`.
*   **Magenta:** Source inner pattern `[[8,6,6],[6,8,8],[8,8,5]]`. Frame color is 6. Background is 8. Replace non-6 pixels (8 and 5) with 8 -> `[[8,6,6],[6,8,8],[8,8,8]]`. Doesn't match expected `[[8,6,8],[8,8,6],[8,6,6]]`.
*   **Yellow:** No corresponding non-solid shape with a solid yellow frame found.

This is complex. Let's step back and simplify.

**Core Observations:**
1.  The output is a cropped version of the input.
2.  The cropping is determined by the locations of specific 5x5 "target" objects in the input, plus a 1-pixel border.
3.  The target objects in the input are transformed into frames in the output.
4.  The *frame* color of the output object matches the color of the input target object.
5.  The *interior* (3x3) of the output frame is filled with a pattern.
6.  The code failed because it assumed the interior pattern was always just the background color.
7.  The correct interior pattern seems related to the specific color of the frame, but is not simply the background color, nor is it directly copied from anywhere obvious in the input.

Let's look at the relationship between the SOLID input 5x5 block and the final OUTPUT 5x5 frame+pattern.

**Example 1:**
*   Input Solid Blue (all 1s) -> Output Blue Frame with Inner `[[8,8,8],[1,8,1],[8,8,8]]`
*   Input Solid Magenta (all 6s) -> Output Magenta Frame with Inner `[[8,6,8],[8,8,6],[8,6,6]]`
*   Input Solid Yellow (all 4s) -> Output Yellow Frame with Inner `[[8,8,8],[8,4,8],[8,4,8]]`

Is there a pattern based on position within the 3x3 inner grid?
*   Blue: Keeps '1' at (1,1) [relative to 3x3 inner grid].
*   Magenta: Keeps '6' at (0,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).
*   Yellow: Keeps '4' at (1,1), (2,1).

This seems arbitrary. There must be a simpler underlying logic.

Could the "target" object *not* be the solid 5x5 square?
What if the target object is the shape that *looks like* the final output?

Example 1: Does the input contain shapes that look like:
Blue: `[[1,1,1,1,1],[1,8,8,8,1],[1,1,8,1,1],[1,8,8,8,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]` ? No.
Magenta: `[[6,6,6,6,6],[6,8,6,8,6],[6,8,8,6,6],[6,8,6,6,6],[6,6,6,6,6]]` ? No.
Yellow: `[[4,4,4,4,4],[4,8,8,8,4],[4,8,4,8,4],[4,8,4,8,4],[4,4,4,4,4]]` ? No.

Let's reconsider the code's failure points and the expected outputs again.

**Example 1 Failure:**
Expected Blue Inner: `[[8,8,8],[1,8,1],[8,8,8]]` vs Code `[[8,8,8],[8,8,8],[8,8,8]]`
Expected Mag Inner: `[[8,6,8],[8,8,6],[8,6,6]]` vs Code `[[8,8,8],[8,8,8],[8,8,8]]`
Expected Yel Inner: `[[8,8,8],[8,4,8],[8,4,8]]` vs Code `[[8,8,8],[8,8,8],[8,8,8]]`

The code finds the solid 5x5 blocks correctly. It crops correctly. It just fills the inside incorrectly.

Could the pattern inside be related to the *other* 5x5 shapes in the input grid? The ones that are *not* solid?

Input shapes (extracting the 5x5 bounding box):
Shape 1 (Yellow based):

```

```

```

Solid Shape 8 (Magenta):

```
6 6 6 6 6
6 6 6 6 6
6 6 6 6 6

```

Solid Shape 9 (Yellow):

```
4 4 4 4 4
4 4 4 4 4
4 4 4 4 4
4 4 4 4 4
4 4 4 4 4
```


Is there a pairing? Does Shape 3 (Blue based, non-solid) provide the pattern for Solid Shape 7 (Blue)?
Inner 3x3 of Shape 3: `[[1,8,8],[1,1,8],[1,8,8]]`. No.

What if we take the non-solid shape (e.g., Shape 3 for Blue) and replace all background pixels (8) with the shape's main color (1)?
Shape 3 becomes: `[[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]`. That just makes it solid. Doesn't help.

What if we take the non-solid shape (Shape 3) and replace all non-background pixels with the background color?
Shape 3 becomes: `[[8,8,8,8,8],[8,8,8,8,8],[8,8,8,8,8],[8,8,8,8,8],[8,8,8,8,8]]`. Also not helpful.

Let's look at the transformation pixel by pixel for the inner 3x3 square.
Output position `(r, c)` corresponds to input position `(r + crop_offset_r, c + crop_offset_c)`.
The transformation applies to the inner 3x3 part of the 5x5 squares identified as solid in the input.

Let `(R, C)` be the top-left corner of a solid 5x5 square in the input.
The inner 3x3 pixels are at `(R+1..R+3, C+1..C+3)`.
The output pixels corresponding to this inner 3x3 are at `(R+1-r_start, C+1-c_start)` to `(R+3-r_start, C+3-c_start)` where `r_start, c_start` are the top-left coords of the cropped area.

Consider the output blue frame's inner 3x3: `[[8,8,8],[1,8,1],[8,8,8]]`.
The '1's are at relative inner coords (1,0) and (1,2). (Using 0-based index for the 3x3 grid). No, wait, the single '1' is at (1,1)?? Let's re-examine Example 1 output carefully.
Output:

```
8 8 8 8 8 8 8
8 1 1 1 1 1 8  <- Row 1
8 1 8 8 8 1 8  <- Row 2
8 1 1 8 1 1 8  <- Row 3
8 1 8 8 8 1 8  <- Row 4
8 1 1 1 1 1 8  <- Row 5
...
```

The blue frame is rows 1-5, cols 1-5.
The inner 3x3 is rows 2-4, cols 2-4.
Inner 3x3:

```
8 8 8  (Row 2, Col 2-4)
1 8 1  (Row 3, Col 2-4)
8 8 8  (Row 4, Col 2-4)
```

My previous analysis `[[8,8,8],[1,8,1],[8,8,8]]` was correct. Where did the '1's come from?

Consider the non-solid blue shape (Shape 3) input top-left (4,0).

```
1 1 1 8 8
8 1 8 8 8
1 1 1 8 8
8 8 8 8 8
1 1 1 8 8
```

Inner 3x3: `[[1,8,8],[1,1,8],[1,8,8]]`.
Let's try overlaying this on the background color '8'.
Maybe the rule is: For each cell `(i, j)` in the inner 3x3 output:
Output `(i,j)` = Input non-solid inner `(i,j)` IF Input non-solid inner `(i,j)` == Frame Color, ELSE Background Color.

Let's test this:
*   **Blue (Frame=1, Bg=8):**
    Source inner: `[[1,8,8],[1,1,8],[1,8,8]]`
    Apply rule: `[[1,8,8],[1,1,8],[1,8,8]]` -> Keep 1s, replace 8s with 8 -> `[[1,8,8],[1,1,8],[1,8,8]]`. Still not `[[8,8,8],[1,8,1],[8,8,8]]`.

*   **Magenta (Frame=6, Bg=8):**
    Source inner (from Shape 5): `[[8,6,6],[6,8,8],[8,8,5]]`
    Apply rule: Keep 6s, replace 8s and 5s with 8 -> `[[8,6,6],[6,8,8],[8,8,8]]`. Still not `[[8,6,8],[8,8,6],[8,6,6]]`.

*   **Yellow (Frame=4, Bg=8):**
    Source inner (from Shape 1): `[[8,4,8],[8,4,8],[8,8,8]]`
    Apply rule: Keep 4s, replace 8s with 8 -> `[[8,4,8],[8,4,8],[8,8,8]]`. Still not `[[8,8,8],[8,4,8],[8,4,8]]`.

What if the source shape isn't the non-solid one of the *same* color?
Is there ONE source shape whose inner 3x3 pattern is somehow used for *all* output frames, adapted for color?
Example 1 expected inner patterns:
Blue: `[[8,8,8],[1,8,1],[8,8,8]]`
Magenta: `[[8,6,8],[8,8,6],[8,6,6]]`
Yellow: `[[8,8,8],[8,4,8],[8,4,8]]`

These look like pixel masks. Let Mask be a 3x3 boolean grid.
OutputInner(i,j) = FrameColor if Mask(i,j) is True, else BackgroundColor.

Mask for Blue: `[[F,F,F],[T,F,T],[F,F,F]]` -> Needs `True` at (1,0) and (1,2). Oh wait, the expected output is `[[8,8,8],[1,8,1],[8,8,8]]`. That `1` is at `(1,1)`. My visual parsing error again! Let's re-verify the output matrix for Blue frame (Rows 1-5, Cols 1-5):
Row 1: 1 1 1 1 1
Row 2: 1 8 8 8 1
Row 3: 1 1 8 1 1 <-- Error in prompt's expected output? Or my reading? Let me check the web UI for this task (if possible). Assuming the prompt is correct: `[[8,8,8],[1,8,1],[8,8,8]]`
Mask_Blue: `[[F,F,F],[T,F,T],[F,F,F]]` (True at (1,0) and (1,2))

Mask for Magenta: `[[F,T,F],[F,F,T],[F,T,T]]` (True at (0,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2))

Mask for Yellow: `[[F,F,F],[F,T,F],[F,T,F]]` (True at (1,1), (2,1))

These masks are different for each color. Where do the masks come from?
Maybe from the inner 3x3 of the non-solid shapes?
Non-solid Blue inner: `[[1,1,1],[8,1,8],[1,1,1]]`. Where Mask = (pixel == FrameColor=1) -> `[[T,T,T],[F,T,F],[T,T,T]]`. Does not match Mask_Blue.
Non-solid Magenta inner: `[[8,6,6],[6,8,8],[8,8,5]]`. Where Mask = (pixel == FrameColor=6) -> `[[F,T,T],[T,F,F],[F,F,F]]`. Does not match Mask_Magenta.
Non-solid Yellow inner (Shape 1): `[[4,8,4],[4,8,4],[8,8,8]]`. Where Mask = (pixel == FrameColor=4) -> `[[T,F,T],[T,F,T],[F,F,F]]`. Does not match Mask_Yellow.

Let's check Example 2:
Input: Bg=4. Solid 5x5 blocks: Blue(1) at (1,1), Red(2) at (1,7), Green(3) at (1,13).
Output: Cropped (rows 0-6). Frames for Blue, Red, Green.
Expected Inner Blue: `[[4,4,4],[4,4,4],[4,4,4]]` (Code gives this) -> My code `[[4,4,4],[4,4,4],[4,4,4]]` -> Match!
Expected Inner Red: `[[4,2,4],[4,4,2],[4,2,4]]` -> Code gives `[[4,4,4],[4,4,4],[4,4,4]]` -> Mismatch!
Expected Inner Green: `[[4,3,4],[4,4,4],[3,4,3]]` -> Code gives `[[4,4,4],[4,4,4],[4,4,4]]` -> Mismatch!

Okay, Example 2 shows the hollowing *sometimes* just uses the background color (for Blue), but sometimes uses a pattern (for Red, Green).

Where do the patterns for Red and Green come from in Example 2 input?
Non-solid Red shapes? None obvious.
Non-solid Green shapes? None obvious.
The shapes at the bottom are different colors (Magenta, Azure, Maroon, etc.)

This suggests the pattern is *intrinsic* to the color itself, not copied from elsewhere in the grid?
Let's map Color -> Inner Pattern (using Bg=Background):
Ex1: Blue(1) -> `[[Bg,Bg,Bg],[1,Bg,1],[Bg,Bg,Bg]]` (Using the corrected pattern `1 1 8 1 1` for row 3 -> Inner = `[[8,8,8],[1,8,1],[8,8,8]]`)
Ex1: Magenta(6) -> `[[Bg,6,Bg],[Bg,Bg,6],[Bg,6,6]]`
Ex1: Yellow(4) -> `[[Bg,Bg,Bg],[Bg,4,Bg],[Bg,4,Bg]]`
Ex2: Blue(1) -> `[[Bg,Bg,Bg],[Bg,Bg,Bg],[Bg,Bg,Bg]]` (All Background!)
Ex2: Red(2) -> `[[Bg,2,Bg],[Bg,Bg,2],[Bg,2,Bg]]`
Ex2: Green(3) -> `[[Bg,3,Bg],[Bg,Bg,Bg],[3,Bg,3]]`
Ex3: Azure(8) -> `[[Bg,Bg,Bg],[1,Bg,1],[Bg,Bg,Bg]]` (Frame=8, Inner Pattern uses 1 ????) No, check Ex3 output. Frame=8, Inner=`[[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]`. Error in my logic/notes. Recheck Ex3.

**Example 3:**
Input: Bg=1. Solid 5x5: Azure(8) at (1,1), Yellow(4) at (1,7), Green(3) at (7,1), Maroon(9) at (7,7).
Output: Cropped. Frames for Azure, Yellow, Green, Maroon.
Expected Inner Azure(8): `[[1,1,8],[1,1,8],[8,8,1]]` (relative to 3x3)
Expected Inner Yellow(4): `[[1,4,1],[1,1,4],[4,1,4]]`
Expected Inner Green(3): `[[1,1,1],[3,1,3],[3,1,3]]`
Expected Inner Maroon(9): `[[1,9,1],[1,1,9],[9,1,9]]`

Code output (all background):
Inner Azure: `[[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]` -> Mismatch!
Inner Yellow: `[[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]` -> Mismatch!
Inner Green: `[[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]` -> Mismatch!
Inner Maroon: `[[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]` -> Mismatch!

**Summary of Inner Patterns (Color C, Background B):**
*   Ex1, Blue(1), Bg=8: `[[B,B,B],[1,B,1],[B,B,B]]`
*   Ex1, Magenta(6), Bg=8: `[[B,6,B],[B,B,6],[B,6,6]]`
*   Ex1, Yellow(4), Bg=8: `[[B,B,B],[B,4,B],[B,4,B]]`
*   Ex2, Blue(1), Bg=4: `[[B,B,B],[B,B,B],[B,B,B]]`
*   Ex2, Red(2), Bg=4: `[[B,2,B],[B,B,2],[B,2,B]]`
*   Ex2, Green(3), Bg=4: `[[B,3,B],[B,B,B],[3,B,3]]`
*   Ex3, Azure(8), Bg=1: `[[B,B,8],[B,B,8],[8,8,B]]`
*   Ex3, Yellow(4), Bg=1: `[[B,4,B],[B,B,4],[4,B,4]]`
*   Ex3, Green(3), Bg=1: `[[B,B,B],[3,B,3],[3,B,3]]`
*   Ex3, Maroon(9), Bg=1: `[[B,9,B],[B,B,9],[9,B,9]]`

This looks like a fixed pattern (mask) associated with each **color** (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9) that determines where the color `C` appears in the inner 3x3 grid, with the rest being the background `B`.

Let's define the masks (True = Color C, False = Background B):
*   Mask(1): `[[F,F,F],[T,F,T],[F,F,F]]` (From Ex1) vs `[[F,F,F],[F,F,F],[F,F,F]]` (From Ex2). Inconsistent!

This inconsistency kills the fixed-mask-per-color idea.

**What else varies between examples?** The background color.
*   Ex1: Bg=8
*   Ex2: Bg=4
*   Ex3: Bg=1

Could the inner pattern depend on *both* the frame color *and* the background color? Seems too complex.

Let's reconsider the **source pattern**. Maybe the source pattern isn't from a non-solid shape of the *same* color, but from a specific designated shape in the grid?

Look at Example 2 again.
Input: Solid Blue, Red, Green at top. Other shapes below.
Output: Frames Blue, Red, Green. Inner Blue is all Bg(4). Inner Red/Green have patterns.
Non-solid shapes below: Magenta(6) frame at (8,5), Azure(8) frame at (8,9), Maroon(9) frame at (12,9).
Inner 3x3 Magenta: `[[6,4,6],[1,1,4],[4,6,6]]`
Inner 3x3 Azure: `[[8,4,4],[8,8,8],[4,4,4]]`
Inner 3x3 Maroon: `[[4,3,4],[3,3,4],[3,4,9]]`

Can we derive the output patterns from these?
Output Red Inner: `[[4,2,4],[4,4,2],[4,2,4]]`
Output Green Inner: `[[4,3,4],[4,4,4],[3,4,3]]`

No obvious connection.

**Final Hypothesis Attempt:**
The core idea of finding SOLID 5x5 blocks and cropping seems correct based on the code's partial success (correct cropping, correct frame colors). The error is ONLY in the inner 3x3 pattern.
The pattern is NOT always background.
The pattern is NOT consistently copied from non-solid shapes.
The pattern is NOT a fixed mask per color.

What if the pattern IS copied, but from the input location **corresponding to the output location**?
No, that makes no sense. The output is cropped.

Let's assume the initial code's `find_solid_5x5_rectangles` is correct.
Let the list of found rectangles be `target_rectangles = [(r1, c1, color1), (r2, c2, color2), ...]`.
The cropping is calculated based on these `(r, c)` values.
The output grid `output_grid_np` is created.
The loop `for r, c, color in target_rectangles:` iterates through the solid blocks found in the *input*.
It calculates the corresponding `out_r, out_c` in the *output*.
The code then does `output_grid_np[out_r + 1 : out_r + 4, out_c + 1 : out_c + 4] = background_color`. This is the line that needs changing.

The value should be `pattern`. How is `pattern` determined for `color` at `(r, c)`?

Is it possible the inner 3x3 pattern of the output frame comes from the inner 3x3 of the *original input grid* at that same location `(r+1:r+4, c+1:c+4)`? Let's test.

**Example 1:**
*   Solid Blue at (1, 13). Input Inner 3x3 is `[[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]`. Expected Output Inner is `[[8,8,8],[1,8,1],[8,8,8]]`. NO MATCH.
*   Solid Magenta at (7, 13). Input Inner 3x3 is `[[6,6,6],[6,6,6],[6,6,6]]`. Expected Output Inner is `[[8,6,8],[8,8,6],[8,6,6]]`. NO MATCH.
*   Solid Yellow at (13, 13). Input Inner 3x3 is `[[4,4,4],[4,4,4],[4,4,4]]`. Expected Output Inner is `[[8,8,8],[8,4,8],[8,4,8]]`. NO MATCH.

Hypothesis failed.

**Re-read problem statement:** Nothing suggests copying patterns from elsewhere or complex rules. "hollow out" was my interpretation. The transformation modifies the identified solid 5x5 rectangles.

Could the transformation depend on the *location*? No, ARC tasks usually avoid location-dependent rules unless relative.

Is it about **overlapping** shapes? In Ex1, the non-solid shapes are separate from the solid ones.

What if the "solid 5x5" identification is wrong? What if the target object is defined differently?
Maybe it's any 5x5 square whose *center* pixel is non-background?
Or whose *corner* pixel is non-background?

Let's stick with the idea that the code correctly identifies the shapes that *matter* (the solid 5x5 ones) and correctly crops. The transformation rule for the interior is the missing piece.

Could the interior pattern be the original 3x3 input pattern, but with certain pixels replaced by the background color based on a mask? And the mask comes from... where?

Let's look at the simplest case: Example 2, Blue frame. Input is solid blue. Output inner is all background.
Example 1, Blue frame. Input is solid blue. Output inner is `[[8,8,8],[1,8,1],[8,8,8]]`.

Why is Blue treated differently in Ex1 vs Ex2? Background color is different (8 vs 4).
Rule: Fill inner 3x3 with Background, EXCEPT if the pixel value `p` at `Input[r+i, c+j]` (where i,j = 1..3) meets some condition? What condition?

What if the patterns come from the *numerals* themselves? 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9? No, ARC avoids semantic interpretation of digits.

Let's try the code execution again to get precise metrics for the differences.
