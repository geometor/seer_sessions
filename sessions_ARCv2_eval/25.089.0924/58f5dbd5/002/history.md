*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming an input grid containing various colored shapes on a background into an output grid. The output grid is a cropped section of the input grid, containing only specific shapes from the input, modified. The core transformation appears to be identifying solid 5x5 rectangular blocks of color, cropping the grid to contain these blocks plus a one-pixel border of the background color, and then "hollowing out" these 5x5 blocks by changing their inner 3x3 core to the background color, leaving only the frame.

        description: The background color and the colors of the frames of the hollowed_objects in the output are the same as their corresponding colors in the input.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the background color of the input grid (this is typically the most frequent color or the color forming the outer border).
    2.  Identify all contiguous regions (objects) of non-background colors in the input grid.
    3.  Filter these objects, keeping only those that are perfectly solid (contain no background pixels) 5x5 rectangles. Let these be the "target rectangles".
    4.  Find the minimum bounding box that encompasses all identified target rectangles. Get the minimum row (`min_r`), maximum row (`max_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), and maximum column (`max_c`) coordinates covered by these rectangles.
    5.  Define the region for the output grid by expanding this bounding box by one pixel in each direction: from `row = max(0, min_r - 1)` to `row = min(input_height - 1, max_r + 1)` and from `col = max(0, min_c - 1)` to `col = min(input_width - 1, max_c + 1)`.
    6.  Create the output grid by copying the pixels from the input grid within this calculated expanded region.
    7.  For each target rectangle originally located at `(r, c)` to `(r+4, c+4)` in the input grid:
        a.  Calculate its corresponding top-left starting position `(out_r, out_c)` within the output grid. `out_r = r - max(0, min_r - 1)` and `out_c = c - max(0, min_c - 1)`.
        b.  Modify the output grid by changing the color of the pixels in the 3x3 area from `(out_r + 1, out_c + 1)` to `(out_r + 3, out_c + 3)` to the background color identified in step 1.
