Identify the background color (assumed to be the color of the top-left pixel).\n2. Find all solid 5x5 rectangular blocks of a single non-background color within the input grid.\n3. If no such blocks are found, return a 1x1 grid containing the background color.\n4. Determine the minimum bounding box that encompasses all identified 5x5 blocks.\n5. Calculate the dimensions of the output grid by expanding this bounding box by one pixel in each direction (top, bottom, left, right), constrained by the input grid boundaries.\n6. Create the output grid by copying the corresponding subgrid from the input.\n7. For each identified solid 5x5 block in the input:\n    a. Locate its corresponding 5x5 area in the output grid.\n    b. Modify this area by setting the inner 3x3 pixels to the background color, effectively creating a hollow frame.\n\nNOTE: This initial implementation assumes the 'hollowing' always uses the background color.\nThis matches some examples but fails on others where the interior has a specific pattern\nrelated to the frame color. The logic for determining the correct interior pattern\nneeds refinement based on further analysis of the examples where this simple hollowing fails.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_solid_5x5_rectangles(grid: np.ndarray, background_color: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all solid 5x5 rectangles of a single non-background color.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input numpy array grid.\n        background_color: The background color to ignore.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of tuples, where each tuple contains (row, col, color)\n        for the top-left corner of a found 5x5 rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    target_rectangles = []\n    height, width = grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through possible top-left corners of 5x5 squares\n    # Ensure iteration bounds are valid (height-4 and width-4 must be >= 0)\n    if height < 5 or width < 5:\n        return [] # Cannot have 5x5 rectangles\n\n    for r in range(height - 4):\n        for c in range(width - 4):\n            # Get the color of the potential top-left corner\n            color = grid[r, c]\n\n            # Skip if it's the background color\n            if color == background_color:\n                continue\n\n            # Extract the 5x5 subgrid\n            subgrid = grid[r:r+5, c:c+5]\n\n            # Check if all pixels in the subgrid have the same color 'color'\n            if np.all(subgrid == color):\n                target_rectangles.append((r, c, color))\n\n    return target_rectangles\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by finding solid 5x5 rectangles, cropping around them,\n    and hollowing them out with the background color.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Handle empty input grid case\n    if grid_np.size == 0:\n        return [[]]\n        \n    height, width = grid_np.shape\n\n    # 1.
