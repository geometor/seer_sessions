Identify the background color: This is the most frequent color in the input grid.\n2. Identify the seed/fill color: A heuristic is used - it's assumed to be the least frequent color among all colors that are cardinally adjacent to the background color in the input grid.\n3. Identify seed pixel locations: These are all pixels in the input grid matching the identified seed/fill color.\n4. Initialize a processing queue: Add all background-colored pixels that are cardinally adjacent to any seed pixel location to the queue. Mark these pixels as visited.\n5. Perform flood fill:\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a pixel location (r, c).\n   - Change the color of this pixel in the output grid to the seed/fill color.\n   - Examine the four cardinal neighbors of (r, c).\n   - If a neighbor is within grid bounds, has the background color in the *input* grid, and has not been visited, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.\n6. Return the modified grid.\n\nNote: The heuristic for identifying the seed/fill color (step 2) is based on observations from the training examples but might not be universally applicable to all possible test cases for this task type if the underlying rule is different. It correctly identifies the seed/fill color for train_1 and train_2, but not for train_3.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _find_most_frequent_color(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds the most frequent color in the grid.\"\"\"\n    if grid.size == 0:\n        # Return a default color (e.g., 0 for black/white) if grid is empty\n        return 0 \n    counts = Counter(grid.flatten())\n    if not counts:\n         # Should not happen if grid.size > 0, but handle defensively\n        return 0\n    # The most_common method returns a list of (element, count) tuples\n    background_color = counts.most_common(1)[0][0]\n    return background_color\n\ndef _find_color_locations(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds all (row, col) coordinates of pixels with the given color.\"\"\"\n    # np.argwhere returns pairs of [row, col] indices\n    locations = np.argwhere(grid == color)\n    # Convert to a list of tuples for easier handling\n    return [tuple(loc) for loc in locations]\n\ndef _identify_colors_and_seeds(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies background color (most frequent) and fill color (heuristic-based).\n    Returns background_color, fill_color, seed_locations.\n    \n    Heuristic for fill_color: Least frequent color among those adjacent to the background.\n    \"\"\"\n    if grid.size == 0:\n        return 0, 0, [] # Default values for empty grid\n\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    background_color = _find_most_frequent_color(grid)\n    \n    color_counts = Counter(grid.flatten())\n    non_background_colors = [c for c in color_counts if c != background_color]\n\n    if not non_background_colors:\n        # Grid is monochromatic or empty, no fill possible/needed\n        return background_color, background_color, [] \n\n    # Find non-background colors that are adjacent to the background color\n    adjacent_candidates = []\n    checked_adjacent_colors = set()\n\n    for color in non_background_colors:\n        locations = _find_color_locations(grid, color)\n        is_adjacent_to_background = False\n        for r, c in locations:\n            # Check 4 cardinal neighbors\n            for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                # Check bounds and if neighbor is background\n                if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and grid[nr, nc] == background_color:\n                    is_adjacent_to_background = True\n                    break # Found adjacency for this color instance\n            if is_adjacent_to_background:\n                break # No need to check other locations for this color\n\n        if is_adjacent_to_background:\n            # Store the color and its frequency if it's adjacent\n             adjacent_candidates.append((color, color_counts[color]))\n\n    if not adjacent_candidates:\n         # No non-background color is adjacent to the background.\n         # This might indicate an edge case, like seeds fully enclosed by boundaries.\n         # Return background as fill color, assuming no fill happens.\n         return background_color, background_color, []\n\n    # Sort candidates by frequency (ascending)\n    adjacent_candidates.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n    \n    # Apply the heuristic: the fill color is the least frequent adjacent color\n    fill_color = adjacent_candidates[0][0]\n    \n    # Find all locations of this fill color in the input grid; these are the seeds\n    seed_locations = _find_color_locations(grid, fill_color)\n\n    return background_color, fill_color, seed_locations\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid using a flood fill initiated by seed pixels.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to numpy array for efficient operations\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Handle empty grid case\n    if input_grid_np.size == 0:\n        return []\n        \n    height, width = input_grid_np.shape\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify background color, fill color, and seed locations\n    background_color, fill_color, seed_locations = _identify_colors_and_seeds(input_grid_np)\n\n    # Create the output grid as a deep copy of the input to modify\n    output_grid_np = copy.deepcopy(input_grid_np)\n\n    # If no seeds are found (e.g., monochromatic grid, or heuristic fails), return the original grid\n    if not seed_locations:\n        return output_grid_"
