Transformation Rule Hypothesis (Note: This hypothesis was explored but failed validation against the examples):

1. Identify a key landmark block based on color:
   a. Check for the presence of Azure color (8). If it exists, find all contiguous rectangular blocks of Azure.
   b. If exactly one Azure block is found, this is the landmark.
   c. If no Azure blocks or multiple Azure blocks are found, find the largest contiguous rectangular block of Gray color (5). "Largest" is defined by maximum area, with ties broken by top-most row index, then left-most column index. This Gray block (if found) is the landmark.
2. Determine Output Grid Dimensions based on the landmark block:
   a. If the landmark is the unique Azure block (size H x W):
      - Output height H_out = H - 1 (Requires H > 1).
      - Output width W_out = W.
      (Note: This dimension rule does not fit train_2 example which has H=6, W=6 -> H_out=4, W_out=5).
   b. If the landmark is the largest Gray block (size H x W):
      - Output height H_out = H.
      - Output width W_out = W // 2 + 1.
3. Extract the Output Grid from the Input Grid relative to the landmark block:
   a. If the landmark is the unique Azure block (top-left at R, C):
      - Extract the subgrid of size H_out x W_out located immediately above the landmark block.
      - Specifically, rows from `R - H_out` to `R - 1`, and columns from `C` to `C + W - 1`.
      (Note: Requires `R - H_out >= 0`. Validation showed this extraction does not match the example outputs for train_3 and train_4).
   b. If the landmark is the largest Gray block (top-left at R, C):
      - Extract the subgrid of size H_out x W_out located at the top-left corner *of* the landmark block's position in the input grid.
      - Specifically, rows from `R` to `R + H_out - 1`, and columns from `C` to `C + W_out - 1`.
      (Note: Validation showed this extraction does not match the example output for train_1).
4. Handle edge cases: If no landmark block is identified, or if derived dimensions/indices are invalid, return an empty grid or handle as an error.
