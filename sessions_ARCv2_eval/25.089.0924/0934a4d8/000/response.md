*   **Hypothesis 9: A noise-removal or pattern completion task?** Maybe the input contains a noisy version of the output pattern? This seems less likely given the large size difference and lack of obvious structure preservation.
*   **Hypothesis 10: Find the largest rectangle and extract based on its properties.**
    *   Let L be the largest rectangle (by area) of a single solid color.
    *   If multiple largest rectangles exist, maybe pick the one with the lowest row index, then lowest col index? Or highest color index? Azure (8) is high. Gray (5) is mid.
    *   Let R, C be the top-left row/col of L.
    *   Let H, W be the height/width of L.
    *   Let H_out, W_out be the height/width of the output grid.

    | Example | Largest Rect | Loc (R,C) | Size (H,W) | Output (H_out, W_out) | Relationship? |
    | :------ | :----------- | :-------- | :--------- | :-------------------- | :------------ |
    | train_1 | Gray (5)     | (8, 13)   | (4, 7)     | (4, 4)                | H_out = H? W_out?? |
    | train_2 | Azure (8)    | (2, 21)   | (6, 6)     | (4, 5)                | H_out = H-2? W_out = W-1? |
    | train_3 | Azure (8)    | (14, 25)  | (10, 4)    | (9, 4)                | H_out = H-1? W_out = W? |
    | train_4 | Azure (8)    | (19, 12)  | (4, 7)     | (3, 7)                | H_out = H-1? W_out = W? |

*   The relationship between the largest block's dimensions and the output dimensions looks inconsistent (H_out = H vs H-2 vs H-1; W_out = W vs W-1).

*   **Let's focus on train_4 again.** Largest block is Azure (8), 4x7 at (19, 12). Output is 3x7. The dimensions suggest extracting a region *adjacent* to the azure block. The height matches H-1 (4-1=3), and the width matches W (7).
    *   Which adjacent 3x7 block?
        *   Above: Rows 16-18, Cols 12-18. (Checked, mismatch)
        *   Below: Rows 23-25, Cols 12-18. (Checked, mismatch)
        *   Left: Rows 19-21, Cols 5-11. (Incorrect width)
        *   Right: Rows 19-21, Cols 19-25. (Incorrect width)

*   **What if the extraction location isn't adjacent?** What if the location (R, C) of the largest block determines the location of the output extraction?
    *   **train_4:** Largest block at (19, 12). Output is 3x7.
        *   Try extracting 3x7 starting at (R-H_out, C) = (19-3, 12) = (16, 12). This is the "Above" case, already checked.
        *   Try extracting 3x7 starting at (R-H_out-1, C) = (19-3-1, 12) = (15, 12).

        ```

        No.
    *   Maybe the location is relative but depends on the *color*?
*   **Maybe the "largest block" isn't the key.** Could it be the block with the highest color index? Or the block containing the highest color index?
    *   **train_1:** Highest color is Maroon (9). Many instances. Largest block containing 9? Hard to define. Largest block *of* 9? Let's see. There are several 2x2 blocks of 9. A 3x1 at (24, 1). A 1x3 at (6, 8). A 2x2 at (2, 8). A 2x2 at (3, 8). A 2x2 at (3, 22). A 2x2 at (22, 1). A 2x2 at (23, 1). A 2x2 at (28, 8). A 2x2 at (29, 19). Max area is 4. Let's pick the first one: (2, 8). Output 4x4. No obvious relation.
    *   **train_4:** Highest color is Maroon (9). Many instances. Largest block of 9? Several 2x2s. Max area 4. No obvious relation to the 3x7 output.

*   **Hypothesis 11: Find the single pixel with the highest color index.**
    *   **train_1:** Max color = 9. First occurrence at (0, 3). Output 4x4.
    *   **train_4:** Max color = 9. First occurrence at (0, 1). Output 3x7.
    *   This doesn't seem simpler.

*   **Hypothesis 12: Find the largest *hole* (background color block)?** Background is white (0). Is there white in the inputs? No white (0) in any training input. Let's assume the most frequent color is the background?
    *   **train_1:** Colors: 1(blue): 123, 3(green): 35, 4(yellow): 49, 5(gray): 58, 6(magenta): 74, 7(orange): 56, 9(maroon): 105. Blue (1) is most frequent. Largest blue block? Many 2x2s. A 3x2 at (14, 14). A 2x3 at (8, 8). Max area 6. Output 4x4.
    *   **train_4:** Colors: 1(blue): 46, 2(red): 80, 3(green): 44, 4(yellow): 90, 5(gray): 52, 6(magenta): 104, 7(orange): 130, 9(maroon): 114, 8(azure): 28. Orange (7) is most frequent. Largest orange block? Many 2x2s. A 3x1 at (7,0). A 1x3 at (14,13). Area 4 max. Output 3x7.
    *   This doesn't seem promising either.

*   **Revisiting Hypothesis 10 (Largest block) and the Dimensions:**
    | Ex | Largest Rect | Loc (R,C) | Size (H,W) | Output (H_out, W_out) | Proposed Relation | Extraction Loc (r, c) |
    | :- | :----------- | :-------- | :--------- | :-------------------- | :------------------ | :-------------------- |
    | 1  | Gray (5)     | (8, 13)   | (4, 7)     | (4, 4)                | H_out=H, W_out=W-3    | (R, C+?) (8, 16)?     |
    | 2  | Azure (8)    | (2, 21)   | (6, 6)     | (4, 5)                | H_out=H-2, W_out=W-1  | (R+?, C+?)           |
    | 3  | Azure (8)    | (14, 25)  | (10, 4)    | (9, 4)                | H_out=H-1, W_out=W    | (R-1?, C) (13, 25)?   |
    | 4  | Azure (8)    | (19, 12)  | (4, 7)     | (3, 7)                | H_out=H-1, W_out=W    | (R-1?, C) (18, 12)?   |

    The dimension relationship H_out=H-1, W_out=W seems consistent for Examples 3 and 4. The location seems to be 1 row *above* the found block?
    *   **Check train_3 again:** Largest Azure(8) 10x4 at (14, 25). Output 9x4. Extract 9x4 starting at (R-1, C) = (13, 25).

*   **Final attempt idea: Is there exactly ONE block of the second highest color?**
    *   **train_2:** Color 8. Yes, only one block of 8.
    *   **train_3:** Color 8. Yes, only one block of 8.
    *   **train_4:** Color 8. Yes, only one block of 8.
    *   **train_1:** Second highest color 7. Let's find all blocks of 7. (4,6) 2x2, (5,14) 1x1, (5,18) 1x1, (5,28) 1x1, (6,0) 1x1, ... Many blocks. This rule doesn't work for train_1.

*   Maybe the rule is specific to grids containing color 8?
    *   If color 8 (Azure) is present:
        1.  Find the unique rectangular block of color 8. Let its location be (R, C) and size (H, W).
        2.  Determine output size (H_out, W_out) based on (H, W). (Seems like H-1, W for H>1, W>1? Need to check train_2 again).
            *   train_2: H=6, W=6 -> H_out=4, W_out=5. This breaks H-1, W. Maybe it's max(1, H-1) x W? No. max(1, H-k) x max(1, W-l)?
        3.  Extract the subgrid of size (H_out, W_out) from a location relative to (R, C). (Still unsure about location).
    *   If color 8 (Azure) is NOT present (like train_1):
        1.  Find the largest block of the highest color? (Gray(5) for train_1). 4x7 at (8, 13). Output 4x4.
        2.  Relationship H_out=H, W_out=W-3?
        3.  Extract 4x4 relative to (8, 13). Still unknown location.

*   Let's assume the location for examples 3 and 4 is `Input[R-H_out : R, C : C+W_out]`. That is, the `H_out` rows directly above the found block, aligned horizontally.
    *   **train_3:** H=10, W=4, R=14, C=25. H_out=9, W_out=4. Extract `Input[14-9 : 14, 25 : 25+4]` = `Input[5:14, 25:28]`. (Checked, failed).
    *   **train_4:** H=4, W=7, R=19, C=12. H_out=3, W_out=7. Extract `Input[19-3 : 19, 12 : 12+7]` = `Input[16:19, 12:18]`. (Checked, failed).

*   What if the block location is defined differently? E.g., center?
    *   **train_4:** Block 4x7 at (19, 12). Center ~ (20.5, 15). Output 3x7. No obvious way to get the output `[[3,7,4,4,4,4,7],[6,7,7,9,9,7,7],[7,6,9,7,7,9,6]]` from nearby regions.

*   **Okay, radical idea.** Is the pattern related to symmetry? The inputs often look somewhat symmetric (or reflected).
    *   **train_4:** The input grid has vertical symmetry around the center columns (14/15), but it's imperfect due to the noise/other colors. The azure block is symmetric. The output grid `[[3,7,4,4,4,4,7],[6,7,7,9,9,7,7],[7,6,9,7,7,9,6]]` is NOT symmetric.

*   **Let's look *inside* the block again.**
    *   **train_4:** Azure block 4x7 at (19, 12). Output 3x7.
        
```
        Input[19:23, 12:19]:
        8 8 8 8 8 8 8
        8 8 8 8 8 8 8
        8 8 8 8 8 8 8
        8 8 8 8 8 8 8
        ```

        This can't be it.

*   **Maybe the "block" isn't a solid rectangle?** What if it's defined by a border? Find the largest rectangle *framed* by a specific color?
    *   **train_4:** Look for frames. No obvious single-color frame enclosing a large area.

*   **Is it possible the output is generated, not extracted?**
    *   For `train_4`, compare `Input[16:19, 12:18]` with `Output`.

        Input Above:
        7 3 4 3 3 4 3
        7 7 3 7 7 3 7
        4 3 4 1 1 4 3

        Output:
        3 7 4 4 4 4 7
        6 7 7 9 9 7 7
        7 6 9 7 7 9 6
        ```

        Is there a pixel-wise operation? Or a neighbour-based rule? Doesn't seem obvious. Colors change quite a bit (e.g., Input 7 -> Output 3, Input 3 -> Output 7, Input 1 -> Output 9?).

*   **Let's reconsider train_1.** Largest gray(5) block 4x7 at (8,13). Output 4x4.
    *   Input[8:12, 13:17] (top-left 4x4): `[[5,2,5,5],[2,5,5,5],[5,5,5,2],[5,5,2,5]]`
    *   Output: `[[6,9,6,6],[9,3,9,9],[3,4,9,9],[1,9,4,1]]`
    *   No obvious transformation.

*   **What if the "largest block" concept is wrong?** What if it's about finding a specific pattern that *contains* the output shape?
    *   **train_4:** Look for a 3x7 region in the input that relates to the output. The output itself isn't present.

*   Let's focus on the commonality: examples 2, 3, 4 have a unique Azure(8) block. Example 1 does not.
    *   Rule could be:
        1. If an Azure(8) block exists and is unique:
            a. Find the block (R, C, H, W).
            b. Calculate output size (H_out, W_out) -> seems tricky. Let's assume for now H_out=H-1, W_out=W. (This works for 3, 4 but not 2).
            c. Extract the subgrid `Input[R-H_out : R, C : C+W_out]` (Region Above).
        2. If no unique Azure(8) block exists:
            a. Find the largest block of Gray(5)? (This fits train_1). Let it be (R, C, H, W).
            b. Calculate output size (H_out, W_out). For train_1, H=4, W=7 -> H_out=4, W_out=4. Maybe H_out=H, W_out=W // 2 + 1 ? (7//2+1 = 4).
            c. Extract the subgrid `Input[R
