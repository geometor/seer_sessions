**Perception**

The input grids contain a single object composed of azure (8) pixels set against a white (0) background. The shape and position of the azure object vary between examples.
The output grids are the same size as the corresponding input grids. They also contain patterns of azure (8) and white (0) pixels.
The transformation appears to involve identifying regions in the input grid based on their relationship to the azure object and the grid boundaries. Specifically, it seems to distinguish between white pixels that are 'outside' (reachable from the border without crossing the azure object) and those that are 'inside' (enclosed by the azure object).
The output grid seems to be generated by:
1.  Changing the original azure pixels in the input to white in the output.
2.  Keeping the 'outside' white pixels as white in the output.
3.  Changing the 'inside' white pixels to azure in the output.
This suggests a flood-fill or region-labeling algorithm starting from the borders.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Identify enclosed white regions within an azure boundary and fill them with azure, while turning the boundary white.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Variable (e.g., 22x22, 12x12, 16x16)
  - colors: [white (0), azure (8)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous_shape
    color: azure (8)
    location: variable within the grid
    role: acts as a boundary or barrier
  - type: region
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - location: surrounding the azure shape
      - classification:
          - exterior: reachable from grid border without crossing azure pixels
          - interior: not reachable from grid border without crossing azure pixels
relationships:
  - white pixels are classified based on their connectivity (8-directional adjacency, including diagonals) to the grid border, constrained by the azure pixels acting as barriers.
actions:
  - identify_boundary_pixels: Find all white pixels adjacent (including diagonals) to any edge of the grid.
  - flood_fill: Starting from the boundary white pixels, mark all reachable white pixels (traveling only through white pixels, using 8-directional adjacency). These are the 'exterior' white pixels.
  - transform_pixels:
    - Input azure (8) pixels become white (0) in the output.
    - Input white (0) pixels marked as 'exterior' remain white (0) in the output.
    - Input white (0) pixels *not* marked as 'exterior' (i.e., 'interior') become azure (8) in the output.
output_description: The output grid represents the 'interior' regions of the input grid filled with azure, while the original azure boundary and the 'exterior' regions are white.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty 'visited' grid/set of the same dimensions as the input grid to keep track of reachable white pixels.
2.  Create a queue and add the coordinates of all white (0) pixels that are located on the border (row 0, last row, column 0, last column) of the input grid. Mark these coordinates as 'visited'.
3.  While the queue is not empty:
    a.  Dequeue a coordinate (r, c).
    b.  Examine its 8 neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
    c.  For each neighbor (nr, nc) that is within the grid bounds:
        i.   If the neighbor cell in the input grid is white (0) and has not been 'visited':
            1.  Mark the neighbor (nr, nc) as 'visited'.
            2.  Enqueue the neighbor's coordinate (nr, nc).
4.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized with a default color (e.g., white).
5.  Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the input grid:
    a.  If the input cell (r, c) is azure (8), set the output cell (r, c) to white (0).
    b.  If the input cell (r, c) is white (0):
        i.   If the coordinate (r, c) is marked as 'visited', set the output cell (r, c) to white (0).
        ii.  If the coordinate (r, c) is *not* marked as 'visited', set the output cell (r, c) to azure (8).
6.  Return the generated output grid.

"""
Identifies enclosed white regions within an azure boundary in the input grid and fills them with azure. The transformation rule involves:
1. Finding all white pixels reachable from the grid borders without crossing azure pixels (exterior white pixels) using a flood fill (BFS) algorithm starting from border white pixels. 4-directional connectivity (up, down, left, right) is used.
2. Creating an output grid where:
   - Original azure pixels (8) from the input become white (0) in the output.
   - Exterior white pixels (0) from the input (those reachable from the border) remain white (0) in the output.
   - Interior white pixels (0) from the input (those *not* reachable from the border) become azure (8) in the output.

6.  **Refine Strategy:** The flood-fill approach was a red herring based on misinterpreting the visual output initially. The coordinate-based pattern (`output[r, c] = 8 if r % 2 != 0 or c % 2 != 0 else 0`) combined with masking (`output[r, c] = 0 if input[r, c] == 8`) seems to match the examples perfectly. I will document this new understanding.

7.  **Structure Response:**
    *   General assessment: Initial hypothesis was incorrect; new hypothesis based on coordinate patterns and masking fits the data.
    *   Metrics: Use the code output.
    *   YAML Facts: Update based on the new hypothesis.
    *   Natural Language Program: Describe the pattern generation and masking process.**General Assessment**

The previous attempt failed because the core transformation logic was misinterpreted. The initial hypothesis focused on identifying and filling enclosed regions using a flood-fill algorithm. However, the code implementing this logic produced outputs drastically different from the expected ones, indicating the flood-fill concept was incorrect for this task.

The analysis of the expected outputs revealed a consistent underlying pattern based on grid coordinates (row and column indices) combined with a masking operation derived from the input grid's azure pixels. The strategy is to implement this pattern generation and masking logic.

task_description: Generate a grid pattern based on coordinates and mask it using the input shape.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Variable, output dimensions match input dimensions.
  - colors: [white (0), azure (8)] in both input and output.
objects:
  - type: coordinate_based_pattern
    description: An underlying pattern determined by the row and column index of each pixel.
    color_rule: A pixel at (row, col) is azure (8) if the row index is odd OR the column index is odd. Otherwise, it is white (0).
  - type: input_mask
    description: The shape formed by the azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
    role: Used to erase parts of the coordinate-based pattern.
relationships:
  - The final output color at a pixel (row, col) depends on both the coordinate-based pattern value at that pixel AND the color of the input pixel at (row, col).
actions:
  - generate_base_pattern: Create an intermediate grid of the same dimensions as the input. For each cell (row, col), set its color to azure (8) if `row % 2 != 0` or `c % 2 != 0`, otherwise set it to white (0).
  - apply_mask: Iterate through the input grid. For every pixel (row, col) where the input color is azure (8), set the corresponding pixel in the base pattern grid to white (0).
output_description: The final output grid is the result of the base pattern after being masked by the input azure shape. Pixels corresponding to the original input azure shape are always white in the output. Other pixels retain the color determined by the coordinate-based pattern (azure if row or column is odd, white if both are even).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the height and width of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid of the same height and width.
3.  Iterate through each cell of the grid using its row index `r` (from 0 to height-1) and column index `c` (from 0 to width-1).
4.  For each cell `(r, c)`:
    a.  Check the color of the corresponding cell `(r, c)` in the **input** grid.
    b.  If the **input** cell color is azure (8):
        i.  Set the **output** cell `(r, c)` color to white (0).
    c.  Else (if the **input** cell color is white (0)):
        i.  Check if the row index `r` is odd OR the column index `c` is odd.
        ii. If `r` is odd OR `c` is odd, set the **output** cell `(r, c)` color to azure (8).
        iii. If both `r` is even AND `c` is even, set the **output** cell `(r, c)` color to white (0).
5.  Return the completed output grid.
