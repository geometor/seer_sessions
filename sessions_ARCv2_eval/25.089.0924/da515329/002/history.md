**Perception**

The input grids contain a single object composed of azure (8) pixels set against a white (0) background. The shape and position of the azure object vary between examples.
The output grids are the same size as the corresponding input grids. They also contain patterns of azure (8) and white (0) pixels.
The transformation appears to involve identifying regions in the input grid based on their relationship to the azure object and the grid boundaries. Specifically, it seems to distinguish between white pixels that are 'outside' (reachable from the border without crossing the azure object) and those that are 'inside' (enclosed by the azure object).
The output grid seems to be generated by:
1.  Changing the original azure pixels in the input to white in the output.
2.  Keeping the 'outside' white pixels as white in the output.
3.  Changing the 'inside' white pixels to azure in the output.
This suggests a flood-fill or region-labeling algorithm starting from the borders.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Identify enclosed white regions within an azure boundary and fill them with azure, while turning the boundary white.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Variable (e.g., 22x22, 12x12, 16x16)
  - colors: [white (0), azure (8)]
objects:
  - type: contiguous_shape
    color: azure (8)
    location: variable within the grid
    role: acts as a boundary or barrier
  - type: region
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - location: surrounding the azure shape
      - classification:
          - exterior: reachable from grid border without crossing azure pixels
          - interior: not reachable from grid border without crossing azure pixels
relationships:
  - white pixels are classified based on their connectivity (8-directional adjacency, including diagonals) to the grid border, constrained by the azure pixels acting as barriers.
actions:
  - identify_boundary_pixels: Find all white pixels adjacent (including diagonals) to any edge of the grid.
  - flood_fill: Starting from the boundary white pixels, mark all reachable white pixels (traveling only through white pixels, using 8-directional adjacency). These are the 'exterior' white pixels.
  - transform_pixels:
    - Input azure (8) pixels become white (0) in the output.
    - Input white (0) pixels marked as 'exterior' remain white (0) in the output.
    - Input white (0) pixels *not* marked as 'exterior' (i.e., 'interior') become azure (8) in the output.
output_description: The output grid represents the 'interior' regions of the input grid filled with azure, while the original azure boundary and the 'exterior' regions are white.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty 'visited' grid/set of the same dimensions as the input grid to keep track of reachable white pixels.
2.  Create a queue and add the coordinates of all white (0) pixels that are located on the border (row 0, last row, column 0, last column) of the input grid. Mark these coordinates as 'visited'.
3.  While the queue is not empty:
    a.  Dequeue a coordinate (r, c).
    b.  Examine its 8 neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
    c.  For each neighbor (nr, nc) that is within the grid bounds:
        i.   If the neighbor cell in the input grid is white (0) and has not been 'visited':
            1.  Mark the neighbor (nr, nc) as 'visited'.
            2.  Enqueue the neighbor's coordinate (nr, nc).
4.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized with a default color (e.g., white).
5.  Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the input grid:
    a.  If the input cell (r, c) is azure (8), set the output cell (r, c) to white (0).
    b.  If the input cell (r, c) is white (0):
        i.   If the coordinate (r, c) is marked as 'visited', set the output cell (r, c) to white (0).
        ii.  If the coordinate (r, c) is *not* marked as 'visited', set the output cell (r, c) to azure (8).
6.  Return the generated output grid.
```python
"""
Identifies enclosed white regions within an azure boundary in the input grid. 
The transformation rule involves:
1. Finding all white pixels reachable from the grid borders without crossing azure pixels (exterior white pixels) using a flood fill (BFS) algorithm starting from border white pixels.
2. Creating an output grid where:
   - Original azure pixels become white.
   - Exterior white pixels remain white.
   - White pixels not reachable from the border (interior white pixels) become azure.
