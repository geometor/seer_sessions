The shape and position of the azure object vary between examples.\nThe output grids are the same size as the corresponding input grids. They also contain patterns of azure (8) and white (0) pixels.\nThe transformation appears to involve identifying regions in the input grid based on their relationship to the azure object and the grid boundaries. Specifically, it seems to distinguish between white pixels that are 'outside' (reachable from the border without crossing the azure object) and those that are 'inside' (enclosed by the azure object).\nThe output grid seems to be generated by:\n1.  Changing the original azure pixels in the input to white in the output.\n2.  Keeping the 'outside' white pixels as white in the output.\n3.  Changing the 'inside' white pixels to azure in the output.\nThis suggests a flood-fill or region-labeling algorithm starting from the borders.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
