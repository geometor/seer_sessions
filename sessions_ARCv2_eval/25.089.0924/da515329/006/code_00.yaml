task_description: Generate a grid pattern based on coordinates and mask it using the input shape.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Variable, output dimensions match input dimensions.
  - colors: [white (0), azure (8)] in both input and output.
objects:
  - type: coordinate_based_pattern
    description: An underlying pattern determined by the row and column index of each pixel.
    color_rule: A pixel at (row, col) is azure (8) if the row index is odd OR the column index is odd. Otherwise, it is white (0).
  - type: input_mask
    description: The shape formed by the azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
    role: Used to erase parts of the coordinate-based pattern.
relationships:
  - The final output color at a pixel (row, col) depends on both the coordinate-based pattern value at that pixel AND the color of the input pixel at (row, col).
actions:
  - generate_base_pattern: Create an intermediate grid of the same dimensions as the input. For each cell (row, col), set its color to azure (8) if `row % 2 != 0` or `c % 2 != 0`, otherwise set it to white (0).
  - apply_mask: Iterate through the input grid. For every pixel (row, col) where the input color is azure (8), set the corresponding pixel in the base pattern grid to white (0).
output_description: The final output grid is the result of the base pattern after being masked by the input azure shape. Pixels corresponding to the original input azure shape are always white in the output. Other pixels retain the color determined by the coordinate-based pattern (azure if row or column is odd, white if both are even).
