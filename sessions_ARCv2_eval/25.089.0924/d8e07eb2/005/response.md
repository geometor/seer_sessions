    Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
    1. Identify all gray (8) pixels located *above* the second magenta line 
       (i.e., in rows 0 through 26) that are adjacent (including diagonals, 
       8-connectivity) to any pixel that is neither gray (8) nor magenta (6) 
       (these non-gray, non-magenta pixels are termed 'ShapePixels').
    2. Change these identified adjacent gray pixels to green (3).
    3. Keep track if any of the pixels changed to green in step 2 are located 
       within the top 5 rows (rows 0-4).
    4. If any changes occurred in the top 5 rows, change all pixels in the 
       bottom two rows (rows 28-29) to green (3).
    5. Otherwise (if no changes occurred in the top 5 rows), change all pixels 
       in the bottom two rows (rows 28-29) to red (2).
    6. All other pixels, including the original ShapePixels and magenta lines, 
       retain their original color unless modified by rule 2 or rules 4/5.
