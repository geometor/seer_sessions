Change these identified adjacent gray pixels to green (3).\n    3. Keep track if any of the pixels changed to green in step 2 are located \n       within the top 5 rows (rows 0-4).\n    4. If any changes occurred in the top 5 rows, change all pixels in the \n       bottom two rows (rows 28-29) to green (3).\n    5. Otherwise (if no changes occurred in the top 5 rows), change all pixels \n       in the bottom two rows (rows 28-29) to red (2).\n    6.
