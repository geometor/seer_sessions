Two distinct horizontal lines composed entirely of magenta (6) pixels are present at row index 5 and row index 27, acting as visual separators.\n2.  **Objects:** Scattered across the gray background, primarily between the magenta lines and in the area above the first magenta line, are small, distinct shapes made of various colors (white-0, blue-1, red-2, green-3, yellow-4, gray-5, orange-7, maroon-9). These shapes are typically 3x3 or smaller arrangements of pixels.\n3.  **Key Colors:** Gray (8) is the background. Magenta (6) forms separators. Green (3) is introduced in the output as a replacement for some gray pixels. Red (2) is also introduced in the output, specifically in the bottom two rows under certain conditions.\n4.  **Transformation Areas:** Changes primarily occur in two ways:\n    *   Gray pixels immediately surrounding (including diagonally) the colorful shapes change to green (3).\n    *   The bottom two rows (rows 28 and 29), which are initially gray (8), are uniformly changed to either green (3) or red (2).\n5.  **Invariance:** The magenta separator lines (rows 5 and 27) and the original colorful shapes themselves remain unchanged in the output.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Create a list to store the coordinates `(row, col)` of gray (8) pixels that need to change color.\n3.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.\n4.  If the pixel at `(r, c)` is gray (8):\n    a.  Check all 8 neighbors (including diagonals) of `(r, c)`.\n    b.  If any neighbor exists within the grid boundaries and its color is *not* gray (8) and *not* magenta (6), add the coordinate `(r, c)` to the list of pixels to change.\n5.  Keep track if any changes were identified within the top section (rows 0 to 4 inclusive) during step 4b. Let's call this flag `top_section_changed`, initially False. If a coordinate `(r, c)` with `r <= 4` is added to the list in step 4b, set `top_section_changed` to True.\n6.  Iterate through the list of coordinates identified in step 4. For each coordinate `(r, c)` in the list, change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to green (3).\n7.  Determine the color for the bottom two rows (rows 28 and 29):\n    a.  If `top_section_changed` is True, the target color is green (3).\n    b.  If `top_section_changed` is False, the target color is red (2).\n8.  Change all pixels in rows 28 and 29 of the output grid to the determined target color.\n9.  Return the final output grid."
