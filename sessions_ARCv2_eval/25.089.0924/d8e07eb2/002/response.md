## Assessment and Strategy

The previous code timed out, indicating an inefficiency likely related to iterating through every gray pixel and checking its neighbors. The core logic observed from the first example—changing gray pixels adjacent to specific colored shapes and setting the bottom rows based on changes in the top section—appears largely correct based on visual inspection of the other examples.

The strategy is to reverse the primary loop: instead of checking neighbors for every *gray* pixel, we will iterate through every *non-gray, non-magenta* pixel and identify its adjacent *gray* neighbors. This significantly reduces the number of neighbor checks, as the number of "active" colored pixels is much smaller than the number of background gray pixels. We will maintain the logic for determining the color of the bottom two rows based on whether any changes occurred in the top section (rows 0-4).

## Metrics

No code execution is needed to gather metrics for this specific issue, as the problem was a timeout (inefficiency) rather than incorrect output for the provided examples. The core observation is that the number of non-gray, non-magenta pixels is significantly smaller than the number of gray pixels in all examples, making the proposed optimization viable.

*   **Input Grid Dimensions:** Consistently 30x22 across all examples.
*   **Key Colors:** Gray (8) background, Magenta (6) separators (rows 5, 27), various colors for shapes.
*   **Target Colors:** Green (3) for adjacent grays, Green (3) or Red (2) for bottom rows.
*   **Conditionality:** Bottom rows (28, 29) are Green (3) if any gray pixel in rows 0-4 was changed to Green (3); otherwise, they become Red (2).

## Facts


```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: 30 rows x 22 columns
    - BackgroundColor: Gray (8)
Regions:
  - Name: TopSection
    Location: Rows 0-4
  - Name: Separator1
    Location: Row 5
    Color: Magenta (6)
  - Name: MiddleSection
    Location: Rows 6-26
  - Name: Separator2
    Location: Row 27
    Color: Magenta (6)
  - Name: BottomSection
    Location: Rows 28-29
Objects:
  - Name: ShapePixel
    Properties:
      - Color: Any color except Gray (8) or Magenta (6)
      - Location: Primarily within TopSection and MiddleSection
  - Name: AdjacentGrayPixel
    Properties:
      - Color: Gray (8)
      - Location: Adjacent (including diagonals, 8-connectivity) to a ShapePixel
Actions:
  - Name: FindAdjacentGrays
    Input: Input Grid
    Output: Set of coordinates of AdjacentGrayPixels
    Rule: Iterate through all pixels. If a pixel is a ShapePixel, check its 8 neighbors. If a neighbor is within bounds and is Gray (8), add its coordinates to the output set.
  - Name: TrackTopSectionChanges
    Input: Set of coordinates from FindAdjacentGrays
    Output: Boolean flag (True if changes occurred in TopSection)
    Rule: Check if any coordinate `(r, c)` in the input set has `r <= 4`. Return True if found, False otherwise.
  - Name: ApplyAdjacentChanges
    Input: Input Grid, Set of coordinates from FindAdjacentGrays
    Output: Modified Grid (initial changes)
    Rule: Create a copy of the Input Grid. For each coordinate in the input set, change the pixel color at that coordinate in the copy to Green (3).
  - Name: SetBottomColor
    Input: Modified Grid (from ApplyAdjacentChanges), Boolean flag (from TrackTopSectionChanges)
    Output: Final Output Grid
    Rule:
      - Determine target color: Green (3) if the flag is True, Red (2) if False.
      - Change all pixels in the BottomSection (rows 28-29) of the Modified Grid to the target color.
Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Used to find Gray pixels near ShapePixels (8-directional connectivity).
  - Containment: Changes are assessed based on location within the TopSection to determine the final state of the BottomSection.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Create an empty set called `pixels_to_change` to store the coordinates `(row, col)` of gray pixels that need to change color.
3.  Initialize a boolean flag `top_section_changed` to `False`.
4.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.
5.  If the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` is *neither* gray (8) *nor* magenta (6):
    a.  Check all 8 neighbors (including diagonals) of `(r, c)`. Let the neighbor coordinates be `(nr, nc)`.
    b.  For each neighbor:
        i.  Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the grid boundaries.
        ii. If it is within bounds and the color of the input pixel at `(nr, nc)` is gray (8):
            1.  Add the coordinate `(nr, nc)` to the `pixels_to_change` set.
            2.  If the neighbor's row `nr` is less than or equal to 4, set `top_section_changed` to `True`.
6.  Iterate through the coordinates `(r, c)` stored in the `pixels_to_change` set. For each coordinate, change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output grid* to green (3).
7.  Determine the target color for the bottom two rows (rows 28 and 29):
    a.  If `top_section_changed` is `True`, the target color is green (3).
    b.  If `top_section_changed` is `False`, the target color is red (2).
8.  Change all pixels in rows 28 and 29 of the output grid to the determined target color.
9.  Return the final output grid.
