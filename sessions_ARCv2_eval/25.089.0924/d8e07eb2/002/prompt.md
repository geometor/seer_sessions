    Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
    1. Identify all gray (8) pixels that are adjacent (including diagonals) 
       to any pixel that is neither gray (8) nor magenta (6).
    2. Change these identified gray pixels to green (3).
    3. Keep track if any of the pixels changed to green in step 2 are located 
       within the top 5 rows (rows 0-4).
    4. If any changes occurred in the top 5 rows, change all pixels in the 
       bottom two rows (rows 28-29) to green (3).
    5. Otherwise (if no changes occurred in the top 5 rows), change all pixels 
       in the bottom two rows (rows 28-29) to red (2).
    6. All other pixels retain their original color.
