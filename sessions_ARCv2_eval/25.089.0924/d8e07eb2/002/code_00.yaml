Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: 30 rows x 22 columns
    - BackgroundColor: Gray (8)
Regions:
  - Name: TopSection
    Location: Rows 0-4
  - Name: Separator1
    Location: Row 5
    Color: Magenta (6)
  - Name: MiddleSection
    Location: Rows 6-26
  - Name: Separator2
    Location: Row 27
    Color: Magenta (6)
  - Name: BottomSection
    Location: Rows 28-29
Objects:
  - Name: ShapePixel
    Properties:
      - Color: Any color except Gray (8) or Magenta (6)
      - Location: Primarily within TopSection and MiddleSection
  - Name: AdjacentGrayPixel
    Properties:
      - Color: Gray (8)
      - Location: Adjacent (including diagonals, 8-connectivity) to a ShapePixel
Actions:
  - Name: FindAdjacentGrays
    Input: Input Grid
    Output: Set of coordinates of AdjacentGrayPixels
    Rule: Iterate through all pixels. If a pixel is a ShapePixel, check its 8 neighbors. If a neighbor is within bounds and is Gray (8), add its coordinates to the output set.
  - Name: TrackTopSectionChanges
    Input: Set of coordinates from FindAdjacentGrays
    Output: Boolean flag (True if changes occurred in TopSection)
    Rule: Check if any coordinate `(r, c)` in the input set has `r <= 4`. Return True if found, False otherwise.
  - Name: ApplyAdjacentChanges
    Input: Input Grid, Set of coordinates from FindAdjacentGrays
    Output: Modified Grid (initial changes)
    Rule: Create a copy of the Input Grid. For each coordinate in the input set, change the pixel color at that coordinate in the copy to Green (3).
  - Name: SetBottomColor
    Input: Modified Grid (from ApplyAdjacentChanges), Boolean flag (from TrackTopSectionChanges)
    Output: Final Output Grid
    Rule:
      - Determine target color: Green (3) if the flag is True, Red (2) if False.
      - Change all pixels in the BottomSection (rows 28-29) of the Modified Grid to the target color.
Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Used to find Gray pixels near ShapePixels (8-directional connectivity).
  - Containment: Changes are assessed based on location within the TopSection to determine the final state of the BottomSection.
