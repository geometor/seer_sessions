If a pixel's color is neither white (0) nor the background color (let's call this a 'trigger pixel'), check if it is cardinally adjacent (up, down, left, right) to at least one white pixel.\n4. If a trigger pixel is adjacent to a white pixel, then find all of its cardinal neighbors that have the background color.\n5.
