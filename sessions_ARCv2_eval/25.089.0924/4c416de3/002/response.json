Correct.\n\n*   **Refined Hypothesis:**\n    1.  Identify the background color.\n    2.  Find all distinct contiguous regions of white (0) pixels.\n    3.  For each white region:\n        a.  Find the minimal bounding box of the white region.\n        b.  Determine the coordinates of the four corner *background* pixels immediately outside this bounding box (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right). Let these be `corner_coords`.\n        c.  Find all \"color pixels\" (non-background, non-white) that are located *within* the bounding box or are *cardinally adjacent* to any white pixel within the region.\n        d.  Create an empty mapping `corner_assignment = {TL: None, TR: None, BL: None, BR: None}`.\n        e.  For each color pixel `P` with color `C` at `p_coord`:\n            i.  Calculate the distance from `p_coord` to each corner coordinate in `corner_coords`.\n            ii. Find the corner(s) `K` with the minimum distance.\n            iii.For each minimum-distance corner `k` in `K`: Set `corner_assignment[k] = C`. (If multiple pixels map to the same corner, the last one processed wins? Or maybe the first? Let's assume the last for now, but the examples don't seem to have conflicts resolved differently). *Correction:* Looking at Example 2 Region 2, Green is assigned to TR and BR. This suggests a color *can* be assigned to multiple corners if it's equidistant, or if different pixels of the same color are closest to different corners. Let's refine: Store the *minimum distance found so far* for each corner and the associated color.\n        f.  Revised Step e:\n            i. Initialize `corner_assignment = {TL: {'color': None, 'dist': infinity}, TR: {'color': None, 'dist': infinity}, ...}`\n            ii. For each color pixel `P` with color `C` at `p_coord`:\n                1. For each corner `k` with coordinate `c_coord`:\n                    a. Calculate `d = distance(p_coord, c_coord)`.\n                    b. If `d < corner_assignment[k]['dist']`: Update `corner_assignment[k] = {'color': C, 'dist': d}`.\n                    c. If `d == corner_assignment[k]['dist']`: Maybe append color? No, the output corners are single colors. Let's stick with overwriting based on the last pixel processed, or maybe the pixel with the lowest row/col index wins ties? The simplest is \"last one wins\". Let's test this.\n        g.  Revisiting Ex 2, Region 2. M -> TL. Green pixels -> TR and BR. Which green pixel wins for TR? G1=(8,10) d=2.0. G3=(9,10) d=2.23. G5=(10,12) d=2.0. Tie between G1 and G5. Which green pixel wins for BR? G3=(9,10) d=2.23. G4=(10,11) d=1.41. G5=(10,12) d=0. G5 wins BR. So TR gets Green (from G1 or G5), BR gets Green (from G5). This seems consistent. Let's assume the logic handles ties arbitrarily or based on iteration order.\n    4.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    5.  For each white region's calculated `corner_assignment`:\n        a.  For each corner `k` where `corner_assignment[k]['color']` is not None:\n            i.  Let `C = corner_assignment[k]['color']`.\n            ii. Let `(r, c)` be the coordinate of corner `k`.\n            iii.Color the 2x2 block starting at `(r, c)` in the output grid with color `C`. That is, set `output[r, c]`, `output[r+1, c]`, `output[r, c+1]`, `output[r+1, c+1]` to `C`. Ensure these coordinates are within grid bounds.\n\n*   **Bounding Box Definition:** Needs care. Is it the tightest box around white pixels, or does it include adjacent trigger pixels? Let's assume tightest box around white pixels only.\n*   **Corner Definition:** The background pixel diagonally adjacent to the corner of the white bounding box. E.g., if white bbox is `(r_min, c_min)` to `(r_max, c_max)`, then TL corner is `(r_min-1, c_min-1)`, TR is `(r_min-1, c_max+1)`, BL is `(r_max+1, c_min-1)`, BR is `(r_max+1, c_max+1)`. We need to ensure these are background pixels in the input. What if they aren't? The examples show the corners *are* background pixels.\n*   **Color Pixels:** \"Inside or cardinally adjacent\". Check examples.\n    *   Ex 1: G(5,5), Y(8,5), R(8,8) are inside white bbox (3,3)-(10,10). A(3,10) is adjacent to white @(3,9).\n    *   Ex 2: B(3,4),B(3,6),B(4,5) adjacent to white. Y(4,10) adjacent. M(8,6) adjacent. G(8,10),G(8,11),G(9,10),G(9,12),G(10,11),G(10,12) are inside or adjacent. R(16,8),O(16,10),G(18,8),Y(18,10) are inside.\n    *   Ex 3: Seems consistent.\n\n**Final Check on Strategy:**\nThe core idea is mapping color pixels associated with a white region to the nearest corner background pixel outside the white region's bounding box and then painting a 2x2 block at that corner. This seems robust across the examples.\n\n**Refinement Needed for Implementation:**\n1.  Reliable white region finding (flood fill or similar).\n2.  Bounding box calculation for each region.\n3.  Identification of corner background pixels.\n4.  Identification of all relevant color pixels (inside bbox or adjacent to region's white pixels).\n5.  Distance calculation and assignment logic (handling potential ties implicitly by iteration order or explicitly).\n6.  Painting the 2x2 blocks on the output grid.**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis (coloring immediate background neighbors of trigger pixels adjacent to white) failed significantly. The transformed outputs consistently differed from the expected outputs, indicating a misunderstanding of the transformation's spatial logic. The errors weren't minor pixel misplacements but involved coloring entirely different areas of the grid.\n\nThe revised analysis suggests a more complex relationship involving white regions, their bounding boxes, associated \"color pixels\" (non-background, non-white pixels inside or adjacent to the white region), and the corner background pixels surrounding the white region's bounding box. The transformation appears to involve identifying the closest color pixel to each corner and then painting a 2x2 square at that corner with the identified color.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Implement algorithms to reliably identify contiguous white regions and their bounding boxes.\n2.  For each white region, define the four corner background pixels (e.g., `[r_min-1, c_min-1]`, `[r_min-1, c_max+1]`, etc., ensuring they exist and are background).\n3.  Identify all potential \"color pixels\" associated with the white region (non-background, non-white pixels within the bounding box or cardinally adjacent to a white pixel of that region).\n4.  Implement the distance-based assignment: For each color pixel, find the nearest corner(s). Assign the color to the corner(s) it's closest to, potentially using a mechanism to store the best color found so far for each corner based on minimum distance.\n5.  Apply the 2x2 painting rule to the output grid based on the final corner assignments.\n\n**Metrics and Calculations:**\n\nWe need functions to:\n1.  Find connected components (regions) of a specific color (white=0).\n2.  Calculate the bounding box for a set of coordinates.\n3.  Find color pixels associated with a region.\n4.  Calculate distances and perform corner assignments.\n\nLet's re-calculate corner coordinates and assignments for verification.\n\n*   **Example 1, Region 1 (White BBox: [3,3] to [10,10])**\n    *   Background Color: 1 (Blue)\n    *   Corner Coords: TL=(2,2), TR=(2,11), BL=(11,2), BR=(11,11).

Output 2x2: (15,11), (15,12), (16,11), (16,12). This contains (15,12).\n        *   BL corner: (20,6). Closest pixel: Green. Output 2x2: (19,7), (19,8), (20,7), (20,8). This doesn't contain (20,6).\n        *   BR corner: (20,12). Closest pixel: Yellow. Output 2x2: (19,11), (19,12), (20,11), (20,12). This contains (20,12).\n*   **Hypothesis v3:** Find the corner background pixel `(cr, cc)` (diagonally outside bbox). Assign color `C` based on closest color pixel. The 2x2 block of color `C` is placed such that the pixel at `(cr, cc)` becomes part of the 2x2 block. Specifically, the placement seems to be:\n    *   TL assignment -> 2x2 starts at `(cr, cc)` --> `[cr:cr+2, cc:cc+2]`\n    *   TR assignment -> 2x2 starts at `(cr, cc-1)` --> `[cr:cr+2, cc-1:cc+1]`\n    *   BL assignment -> 2x2 starts at `(cr-1, cc)` --> `[cr-1:cr+1, cc:cc+2]`\n    *   BR assignment -> 2x2 starts at `(cr-1, cc-1)` --> `[cr-1:cr+1, cc-1:cc+1]`\n*   Let's re-re-check Ex 2, Region 3 with Hypothesis v3:\n    *   TL corner: (15,6). Assign: Red. 2x2 start: (15,6). Output should be Red @ `[15:17, 6:8]`. (Doesn't match output @ `[15:17, 7:9]`).\n    *   TR corner: (15,12). Assign: Orange. 2x2 start: (15,11). Output should be Orange @ `[15:17, 11:13]`. (Matches output!)\n    *   BL corner: (20,6). Assign: Green. 2x2 start: (19,6). Output should be Green @ `[19:21, 6:8]`. (Doesn't match output @ `[19:21, 7:9]`).\n    *   BR corner: (20,12). Assign: Yellow. 2x2 start: (19,11). Output should be Yellow @ `[19:21, 11:13]`. (Matches output!)\n*   **Issue:** TL and BL placements don't match. Why? Is the corner definition different? What if corners are defined not diagonally outside, but just adjacent?\n    *   TL corner adj: (r_min-1, c_min) or (r_min, c_min-1)?\n    *   Let's try defining the \"corner anchor\" as the white pixel at the corner of the white bbox.\n    *   White BBox: (16,7) to (19,11).\n    *   White Corners: TL=(16,7), TR=(16,11), BL=(19,7), BR=(19,11).\n    *   Let's find the closest background pixel to each *color pixel*.\n        *   R(16,8): Closest bg = (15,8), (17,8), (16,7). Min dist 1. Let's pick (16,7).\n        *   O(16,10): Closest bg = (15,10), (17,10), (16,11). Min dist 1. Let's pick (16,11).\n        *   G(18,8): Closest bg = (17,8), (19,8), (18,7). Min dist 1. Let's pick (18,7).\n        *   Y(18,10): Closest bg = (17,10), (19,10), (18,11). Min dist 1. Let's pick (18,11).\n    *   Now map these bg pixels to the output 2x2 blocks.\n        *   R -> (16,7). Output 2x2 @ (15,7). Match? Yes.\n        *   O -> (16,11). Output 2x2 @ (15,11). Match? Yes.\n        *   G -> (18,7). Output 2x2 @ (19,7). Match? Yes.\n        *   Y -> (18,11). Output 2x2 @ (19,11). Match? Yes.\n*   **Hypothesis v4 (Simpler?):**\n    1. Identify background color.\n    2. Find all \"color pixels\" (non-bg, non-white).\n    3. For each color pixel `P` at `(r, c)` with color `C`:\n        a. Check its cardinal neighbors.\n        b. If *any* neighbor `(nr, nc)` is white (0):\n            i. Find the cardinal neighbor `(br, bc)` of `P` that is the background color *and* is \"most outwards\" relative to the white neighbor(s). This is complex.\n            ii. Alternative: Find *all* background neighbors `(br, bc)` of `P`.\n            iii. For each such background neighbor `(br, bc)`, determine its position relative to `P`. (e.g., `dr = br-r`, `dc = bc-c`).\n            iv. Paint a 2x2 block using `C`. The block's top-left starting position `(sr, sc)` is determined by `(br, bc)` and the relative direction `(dr, dc)`:\n                *   If neighbor is Up (`dr=-1, dc=0`), start at `(br, bc)`. -> `(r-1, c)`\n                *   If neighbor is Down (`dr=1, dc=0`), start at `(br-1, bc)`. -> `(r, c)`\n                *   If neighbor is Left (`dr=0, dc=-1`), start at `(br, bc)`. -> `(r, c-1)`\n                *   If neighbor is Right (`dr=0, dc=1`), start at `(br, bc-1)`. -> `(r, c)`\n            v. Let's simplify the placement: Place the 2x2 block such that `(br, bc)` is one of the four pixels. The relative position seems consistent: the 2x2 block replaces the color pixel `P` and the background neighbor `(br, bc)` plus two other background pixels to complete the square.\n                *   If bg neighbor is Up `(r-1, c)`, 2x2 is `(r-1,c)`, `(r-1,c+1)`, `(r,c)`, `(r,c+1)`? No. `(r-1,c-1)`, `(r-1,c)`, `(r,c-1)`, `(r,c)`? No.\n                *   Look at Ex 3: `P=(3,3)`=Blue(1). White neighbor=(3,2). Bg neighbor=(2,3). Output 2x2 top-left is (2,2). Replaces (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3). Contains P=(3,3) and BgN=(2,3).\n                *   Look at Ex 3: `P=(3,5)`=Green(3). White neighbor=(3,6). Bg neighbor=(2,5). Output 2x2 top-left is (2,5). Replaces (2,5), (2,6), (3,5), (3,6). Contains P=(3,5) and BgN=(2,5).\n                *   Look at Ex 3: `P=(5,5)`=Yellow(4). White neighbor=(6,4). Bg neighbor=(5,6). Output 2x2 top-left is (5,5). Replaces (5,5), (5,6), (6,5), (6,6). Contains P=(5,5) and BgN=(5,6).\n            vi. **Hypothesis v5 (Final candidate):**\n                1. Identify background color `BGC`.\n                2. Create output grid identical to input.\n                3. Iterate through each pixel `P` at `(r, c)` in the input grid.\n                4. If `input[r, c]` is NOT `BGC` and NOT White(0) (i.e., it's a color pixel `C`):\n                   a. Check cardinal neighbors `(nr, nc)` of `P`.\n                   b. If any neighbor `input[nr, nc]` is White(0):\n                      i. Check cardinal neighbors `(br, bc)` of `P` again.\n                      ii. If any neighbor `input[br, bc]` is `BGC`:\n                         *   Determine the 2x2 block coordinates based on `(r, c)` and `(br, bc)`. The 2x2 block always includes `(r, c)` and `(br, bc)`.\n                         *   If `br == r - 1` (bg neighbor is Up): block is `(r-1, c)` and `(r-1, c-1)`? No. Block top-left is `(r-1, min(c, bc))`. Let's test: `P=(3,3), C=1`. BgN=(2,3). Top-left=(2,3). Block=(2,3),(2,4),(3,3),(3,4). Doesn't match output (2,2).\n                         *   Backtrack: The 2x2 output block seems centered around the *edge* between the color pixel and the background pixel being colored.\n                         *   If BgN is Up `(r-1, c)`: 2x2 TL is `(r-1, c-1)` if `c>0`, else `(r-1, c)`.\n                         *   If BgN is Down `(r+1, c)`: 2x2 TL is `(r, c-1)` if `c>0`, else `(r, c)`.\n                         *   If BgN is Left `(r, c-1)`: 2x2 TL is `(r-1, c-1)` if `r>0`, else `(r, c-1)`.\n                         *   If BgN is Right `(r, c+1)`: 2x2 TL is `(r-1, c)` if `r>0`, else `(r, c)`.\n                         *   Let's test this placement with Ex 3:\n                            *   `P=(3,3), C=1`. White @ (3,2). BgN @ (2,3) (Up). TL = `(3-1, 3-1)` = (2,2). Block colors `(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(3,3)`. Matches output!\n                            *   `P=(3,5), C=3`. White @ (3,6). BgN @ (2,5) (Up). TL = `(3-1, 5-1)` = (2,4)? No, rule was `min(c, bc)` if Up. TL = (2,5). Block colors `(2,5),(2,6),(3,5),(3,6)`. Matches output!\n                            *   `P=(5,5), C=4`. White @ (6,4). BgN @ (5,6) (Right). TL = `(5-1, 5)` = (4,5)? No, rule was `(r-1, c)` if Right and r>0. TL=(4,5). Block colors `(4,5),(4,6),(5,5),(5,6)`. Doesn't match output (5,5)! Output is `(5,5),(5,6),(6,5),(6,6)`.\n                            *   `P=(5,5), C=4`. White @ (6,4). BgN @ (6,5) (Down). TL = `(5, 5-1)` = (5,4). Block colors `(5,4),(5,5),(6,4),(6,5)`. Doesn't match output (5,5)!\n                         *   Okay, the placement logic is still wrong. What if the 2x2 includes the color pixel, the background neighbor, the white neighbor, and the fourth pixel to complete the square?\n                            *   `P=(r,c), W=(wr,wc), B=(br,bc)`. Fourth pixel `F=(fr,fc)`.\n                            *   Ex3, P=(3,3), W=(3,2), B=(2,3). F=(2,2). Block coords {(3,3), (3,2), (2,3), (2,2)}. Output colors these coords with C=1. Match!\n                            *   Ex3, P=(3,5), W=(3,6), B=(2,5). F=(2,6). Block coords {(3,5), (3,6), (2,5), (2,6)}. Output colors these coords with C=3. Match!\n                            *   Ex3, P=(5,5), C=4. W=(6,4) (diag?). No, W must be cardinal. Maybe adjacent white is (4,5)? Input is (4,5)=2!=0. (6,5)=2!=0. (5,4)=2!=0. (5,6)=1!=0. Where is the white? Ah, the white region is (2,2) to (6,6). P=(5,5)=4 is inside. It's adjacent to white at (6,4) and (6,6) -- diagonally. Cardinal adjacency: (4,5)=2, (6,5)=2, (5,4)=2, (5,6)=1. None are white. Why does P=(5,5) trigger? *Re-read task description:* \"adjacent (cardinally) to at least one white (0) pixel\". Pixel (5,5)=4 is NOT adjacent to white. This example contradicts the rule? Let's look at the *output* for P=(5,5)=4. The block is `(5,5),(5,6),(6,5),(6,6)`. Input colors: P=4, (5,6)=1, (6,5)=4, (6,6)=4. This doesn't make sense based on adjacency to white.\n*   **Reset:** Go back to Hypothesis v3 (Corner assignment + specific 2x2 placement). Why did TL and BL fail for Ex 2, Region 3?\n    *   TL corner: (15,6). Assign: Red. Place 2x2 via rule `[cr:cr+2, cc:cc+2]`. -> Red @ `[15:17, 6:8]`. Output is Red @ `[15:17, 7:9]`.
