Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Background Color:** Each example seems to have a dominant background color (blue in train_1, azure in train_2, red in train_3). This color remains largely unchanged in the output, except for specific modifications.
2.  **White Regions:** There are distinct areas or shapes composed of white (0) pixels scattered within the background. These white regions themselves appear unchanged between input and output.
3.  **Trigger Pixels:** Inside or immediately adjacent to these white regions, there are single pixels of various other colors (non-white, non-background). Examples include green, yellow, red in train_1; blue, yellow, magenta, green, red, orange in train_2; blue, green, yellow, maroon, azure in train_3.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of *background* pixels that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to these "trigger" pixels. The background pixels take on the color of the adjacent trigger pixel.
5.  **Condition for Transformation:** The trigger pixel must be adjacent (cardinally) to at least one white (0) pixel for the transformation to occur on its neighboring background pixels.
6.  **Result:** This process often effectively expands the single trigger pixel into a 2x2 block, where the original trigger pixel and its newly colored background neighbors form the block. If a trigger pixel has multiple background neighbors, they all change color.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - role: background
    property: dominant color in the grid (e.g., blue, azure, red)
    persistence: remains mostly constant, except for targeted changes
  - role: region
    property: contiguous area of white (0) pixels
    persistence: shape and location are preserved in the output
  - role: trigger_pixel
    property:
      - color is not white (0)
      - color is not the background color
      - is cardinally adjacent to at least one white (0) pixel
    location: typically found inside or bordering the white regions
    action: causes adjacent background pixels to change color
  - role: target_pixel
    property:
      - color is the background color
      - is cardinally adjacent to a trigger_pixel
    action: color changes to match the adjacent trigger_pixel's color

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    from: trigger_pixel
    to: white (0) pixel
    direction: cardinal (N, S, E, W)
    relevance: condition for the trigger_pixel to activate the transformation
  - type: adjacency
    from: trigger_pixel
    to: target_pixel (background color)
    direction: cardinal (N, S, E, W)
    relevance: defines which pixels will be transformed
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the primary background color of the input grid (the most frequent color).
2.  Create a new grid, initially identical to the input grid. This will be the output grid.
3.  Iterate through every pixel `P` in the input grid at position `(row, col)`.
4.  Let `C` be the color of pixel `P`.
5.  Check if color `C` is *not* white (0) and *not* the background color.
6.  If `C` meets this condition, then check if pixel `P` is cardinally adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to at least one white (0) pixel in the input grid.
7.  If pixel `P` has color `C` (potential trigger) and is adjacent to a white pixel, then examine the cardinal neighbors of `P` again.
8.  For each cardinal neighbor `N` of `P` at position `(neighbor_row, neighbor_col)`:
    *   Check if the color of neighbor `N` in the *input* grid is the background color.
    *   If it is, change the color of the pixel at `(neighbor_row, neighbor_col)` in the *output* grid to color `C`.
9.  After checking all pixels `P` in the input grid, the final state of the output grid represents the result.
