elements:
  - role: background
    property: dominant color in the grid (e.g., blue, azure, red)
    persistence: remains mostly constant, except for targeted changes
  - role: region
    property: contiguous area of white (0) pixels
    persistence: shape and location are preserved in the output
  - role: trigger_pixel
    property:
      - color is not white (0)
      - color is not the background color
      - is cardinally adjacent to at least one white (0) pixel
    location: typically found inside or bordering the white regions
    action: causes adjacent background pixels to change color
  - role: target_pixel
    property:
      - color is the background color
      - is cardinally adjacent to a trigger_pixel
    action: color changes to match the adjacent trigger_pixel's color

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    from: trigger_pixel
    to: white (0) pixel
    direction: cardinal (N, S, E, W)
    relevance: condition for the trigger_pixel to activate the transformation
  - type: adjacency
    from: trigger_pixel
    to: target_pixel (background color)
    direction: cardinal (N, S, E, W)
    relevance: defines which pixels will be transformed
