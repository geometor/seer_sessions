task_description: Fill connected areas containing source pixels.
elements:
  - type: background
    color: orange (7)
    role: Fillable area. Becomes 'fill_color' if connected to a 'source'.
  - type: barrier
    color: magenta (6)
    role: Impassable barrier blocking connectivity. Remains unchanged.
  - type: source
    color: red (2)
    role: Initiates fill in connected components. Remains unchanged.
  - type: fill_color
    color: magenta (6)
    role: The color used for filled background pixels.
transformation:
  type: Conditional Connected Components Fill
  connectivity: 8-way adjacency (including diagonals)
  condition: A connected component must contain at least one 'source' (red) pixel.
  action: Change all 'background' (orange) pixels within a qualifying component to 'fill_color' (magenta).
  scope: Global (entire grid), respecting 'barrier' pixels.
invariants:
  - Original 'barrier' (magenta) pixels remain unchanged.
  - Original 'source' (red) pixels remain unchanged.
  - 'Background' (orange) pixels not part of a component containing a 'source' pixel remain unchanged.
