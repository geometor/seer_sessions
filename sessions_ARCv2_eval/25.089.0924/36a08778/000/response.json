The orange pixels form the background. Vertical magenta lines act as fixed dividers. Red pixels appear as distinct objects within the regions defined by the magenta lines or grid edges. The transformation involves changing some orange pixels to magenta. The change seems related to the proximity or connectivity of orange pixels to red pixels within the regions bounded by the existing magenta lines.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
