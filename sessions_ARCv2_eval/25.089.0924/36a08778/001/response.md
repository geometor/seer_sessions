"""
Identifies connected components consisting of source (red, 2) and target (orange, 7) pixels, using 8-way adjacency (including diagonals). 
Components are bounded by boundary (magenta, 6) pixels. 
If a component contains at least one source (red, 2) pixel, change all target (orange, 7) pixels within that component to the fill color (magenta, 6).
