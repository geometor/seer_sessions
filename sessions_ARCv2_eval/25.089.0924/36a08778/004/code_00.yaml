task_description: Fill connected areas of orange pixels with magenta if the area is connected to a red pixel, respecting magenta boundaries.
elements:
  - type: pixel
    color: orange (7)
    role: Background / Fillable Target. Can change color.
  - type: pixel
    color: red (2)
    role: Source / Initiator. Does not change color. Triggers fill in connected orange pixels.
  - type: pixel
    color: magenta (6)
    role: Barrier / Boundary. Does not change color. Blocks connectivity for the fill operation. Some are present in the input, others are created by the transformation.

  connectivity: 8-way adjacency (including diagonals)
  target_pixels: orange (7)
  source_pixels: red (2)
  barrier_pixels: magenta (6)
  fill_color: magenta (6)
  rule: >
    Identify connected components consisting of only orange (7) and red (2) pixels.
    Connectivity is defined by 8-way adjacency.
    Magenta (6) pixels act as impassable barriers; the components cannot include or cross magenta pixels.
    For each such component, if it contains at least one red (2) pixel, change the color of all orange (7) pixels within that component to magenta (6).
invariants:
  - The positions and colors of red (2) pixels remain unchanged.
  - The positions and colors of magenta (6) pixels *present in the input* remain unchanged.
  - Orange (7) pixels that are not part of a connected component (containing orange and red) that includes at least one red (2) pixel remain orange (7).
