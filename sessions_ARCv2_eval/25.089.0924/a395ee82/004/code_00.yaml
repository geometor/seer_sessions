task_type: pattern_generation_from_properties
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: remain constant between input and output
  - background_color: identified as the most frequent color in the input grid; used to initialize the output grid
objects:
  - type: contiguous_shapes
    definition: pixels of the same color connected orthogonally or diagonally
    properties:
      - color: the specific color of the pixels in the shape
      - size: the number of pixels comprising the shape
      - location: the coordinates of the pixels in the shape
  - role: largest_object
    identification: the contiguous shape with the maximum pixel count among all non-background shapes
    relevant_property: color (referred to as 'shape_color') - its shape and location are ignored for output generation
    tie_breaking: if multiple objects share the maximum size, the color of the first one identified can be used (consistency across examples suggests tie-breaking isn't critical or follows a standard order like top-to-bottom, left-to-right scanning)
  - role: anchor_points
    identification: all single-pixel shapes whose color is different from the background_color AND different from the 'shape_color'
    relevant_properties:
      - color (referred to as 'anchor_color' - assumed consistent for all anchors in a single task instance)
      - location (row, column coordinates)
actions:
  - action: identify_background_color
    input: input grid
    output: background color value
  - action: find_objects
    input: input grid, background_color
    output: list of all contiguous non-background objects with their properties (color, size, locations)
  - action: identify_largest_object_color
    input: list of objects
    output: color of the object with the maximum size ('shape_color') - return null/error if no non-background objects exist
  - action: identify_anchor_points
    input: list of objects, background_color, shape_color
    output: list of single-pixel objects whose color is not background_color and not shape_color; extract their common 'anchor_color' and list of locations - return empty list/null color if no anchors found
  - action: generate_output_grid
    input: input grid dimensions, background_color, anchor_points (locations and anchor_color), shape_color
    process:
      1. Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background_color.
      2. If no anchor points were found OR no largest object color was determined, return the background-filled grid.
      3. For each anchor point location (r, c):
         - Define a 3x3 cross pattern centered at (r, c).
         - Set the pixel at (r, c) in the output grid to 'anchor_color'.
         - Set the pixels at (r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1) in the output grid to 'shape_color', provided these coordinates are within the grid boundaries. Overwrite any existing color (which would initially be the background color).
    output: the final output grid
relationships:
  - relationship: color_mapping
    between: largest_object_color, anchor_point_color
    description: The color of the largest input object ('shape_color') determines the color of the arms of the output crosses. The color of the input anchor points ('anchor_color') determines the color of the center of the output crosses.
  - relationship: spatial_mapping
    between: anchor_point_location, output_pattern_location
    description: Each anchor point's location in the input grid determines the center location for a 3x3 cross pattern in the output grid.
invariants:
  - The shape and location of the largest object in the input do not directly appear in the output.
  - Only the background color, anchor point locations/color, and largest object color contribute to the output grid pattern.
