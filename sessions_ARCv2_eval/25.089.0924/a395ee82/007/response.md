"""
Transforms an input grid by:
1. Identifying the background color (most frequent).
2. Finding all contiguous non-background objects (8-way connectivity).
3. Determining the color ('shape_color') and pixel locations of the largest object (by pixel count).
4. Identifying single-pixel 'anchor' objects whose color is different from both the background and shape_color. The color of these anchors is 'anchor_color', and their locations are recorded.
5. Creating a new grid filled with the background color.
6. Copying the largest object onto the new grid using its original locations and 'shape_color'.
7. If anchor points were found, iterate through each anchor point location:
    a. Draw the 'anchor_color' at the center coordinate.
    b. Draw the 'shape_color' at the four orthogonally adjacent coordinates, respecting grid boundaries. These drawings overwrite any existing pixels (background or the copied largest object).
8. If no non-background objects are found, the output is a grid filled with the background color.
9. If non-background objects exist but no anchor points are found, the output is the grid with the background and the copied largest object.

    Finds all contiguous objects of non-background colors in the grid.
