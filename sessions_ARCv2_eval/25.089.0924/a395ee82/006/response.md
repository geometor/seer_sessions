## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core components: background, largest object, and anchor points, and the basic transformation involving placing crosses. However, the previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed the output grid was built solely from the cross patterns on a background canvas. The comparison between the generated outputs and expected outputs clearly shows that the largest object from the input grid *persists* in the output grid, and the cross patterns are drawn *over* this base grid (background + largest object).

The strategy is to revise the process: first establish the base output grid (background + largest object), then overlay the cross patterns derived from the anchor points and the largest object's color.
