## Perception

The task involves identifying specific objects within an input grid and using their properties (color, size, location) to generate a pattern in the output grid. The core elements appear to be:

1.  **Background:** A dominant color filling most of the grid.
2.  **Largest Object:** A contiguous shape (connected orthogonally or diagonally) made of a single color, which has the largest pixel count compared to other non-background shapes. The color of this object is important.
3.  **Anchor Points:** Single pixels of a specific color, distinct from both the background and the largest object's color. The locations and color of these anchor points are crucial.
4.  **Transformation:** The output grid is generated by placing a specific pattern (a 3x3 cross) centered at each anchor point location. The colors used in the cross pattern are derived from the anchor point color (for the center) and the largest object's color (for the arms). The original shapes from the input grid (including the largest object and the anchors) are not directly copied; only their properties influence the output pattern. The output grid starts as a blank canvas filled with the background color.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: pattern_generation
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: remain constant between input and output
  - background_color: identified as the most frequent color in the input grid; preserved in the output grid except where patterns are drawn
objects:
  - type: contiguous_shapes
    definition: pixels of the same color connected orthogonally or diagonally
    properties:
      - color: the specific color of the pixels in the shape
      - size: the number of pixels comprising the shape
      - location: the coordinates of the pixels in the shape
      - bounding_box: the smallest rectangle enclosing the shape
  - role: largest_object
    identification: the contiguous shape with the maximum pixel count among all non-background shapes
    relevant_property: color (let's call it 'shape_color')
  - role: anchor_points
    identification: all single-pixel shapes whose color is different from the background color and different from the 'shape_color'
    relevant_properties:
      - color (let's call it 'anchor_color')
      - location (row, column coordinates)
actions:
  - action: identify_background_color
    input: input grid
    output: background color value
  - action: find_objects
    input: input grid, background_color
    output: list of all contiguous non-background objects with their properties (color, size, locations)
  - action: identify_largest_object
    input: list of objects
    output: the object with the maximum size, extract its 'shape_color'
  - action: identify_anchor_points
    input: list of objects, background_color, shape_color
    output: list of single-pixel objects whose color is not background_color and not shape_color, extract their 'anchor_color' and locations
  - action: generate_output_grid
    input: input grid dimensions, background_color, anchor_points (locations and anchor_color), shape_color
    process:
      1. Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background_color.
      2. For each anchor point location (r, c):
         - Define a 3x3 cross pattern centered at (r, c).
         - Set the pixel at (r, c) in the output grid to 'anchor_color'.
         - Set the pixels at (r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1) in the output grid to 'shape_color', provided these coordinates are within the grid boundaries.
    output: the final output grid
relationships:
  - relationship: color_mapping
    between: largest_object_color, anchor_point_color
    description: The color of the largest object determines the color of the arms of the output crosses. The color of the anchor points determines the color of the center of the output crosses.
  - relationship: spatial_mapping
    between: anchor_point_location, output_pattern_location
    description: Each anchor point's location in the input grid determines the center location for a 3x3 cross pattern in the output grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the background color by finding the most frequent pixel color in the input grid.
2.  Identify all contiguous objects (groups of connected pixels of the same color, excluding the background color). For each object, record its color, size (pixel count), and pixel locations.
3.  Find the object with the largest size (maximum pixel count). Store its color as `shape_color`.
4.  Find all objects that consist of exactly one pixel. From these single-pixel objects, select those whose color is *not* the background color and *not* the `shape_color`. These are the anchor points. Store their color as `anchor_color` and their locations. (Note: It's assumed all valid anchor points in a given input grid will have the same color).
5.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, and fill it completely with the background color.
6.  Iterate through each identified anchor point location `(row, column)`.
7.  For each anchor point location:
    a.  Place the `anchor_color` at the `(row, column)` coordinate in the output grid.
    b.  Place the `shape_color` at the four orthogonally adjacent coordinates: `(row-1, column)`, `(row+1, column)`, `(row, column-1)`, and `(row, column+1)`, but only if these coordinates are valid (within the bounds of the grid). Overwrite any existing color (which would initially be the background color).
8.  The final state of the output grid after processing all anchor points is the result.
