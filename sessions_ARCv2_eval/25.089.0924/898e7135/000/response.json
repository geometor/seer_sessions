            "text": "Okay, let's refine the \"largest object\" and \"ignored pixels\" ideas based on the areas:\n*   **Train 1:** Red (2) has area 28. Azure (8) has 12. Green (3) has 16. Blue (1) has 4. Orange (7) has 9 objects, each area 1.\n    *   Largest is Red (28). This becomes background.\n    *   Ignored are Orange (7) pixels (area 1).\n    *   Kept are Azure (12), Green (16), Blue (4).\n*   **Train 2:** Green (3) has area 121. Blue (1) has 24. Yellow (4) has 24. Magenta (6) has 20. Gray (5) has two objects of area 4. Azure (8) has 8 objects, each area 1.\n    *   Largest is Green (121). This becomes background.\n    *   Ignored are Azure (8) pixels (area 1).\n    *   Kept are Blue (24), Yellow (24), Magenta (20), Gray (4, 4).\n\nIt appears the logic is:\n1.  Find all contiguous objects of non-white colors.\n2.  Identify objects with area 1. These seem to be ignored/removed. (Let's call them \"noise\"). In both examples, these were orange (7) or azure (8), but the rule might be area-based.\n3.  Among the remaining objects (area > 1), find the one with the largest area.\n4.  The color of this largest object becomes the background color for the output grid. This object itself is not drawn in the output.\n5.  All *other* objects with area > 1 are kept.\n6.  Now, determine the output grid size and placement.\n\n**Output Grid Size and Placement Revisited:**\n*   **Train 1:**\n    *   Largest object (Red): BB is 6x6. Output is 12x12.\n    *   Kept objects (Azure, Blue, Green): Combined BB is Rows 3-17, Cols 2-12 (H=15, W=11). Output is 12x12.\n*   **Train 2:**\n    *   Largest object (Green): BB is 15x10. Output is 28x20. Is it 2*(H-1) x 2*W ? (2*(15-1) x 2*10 = 28x20). This matches!\n    *   Let's check train 1 with this rule: Largest object (Red) BB is 6x6. 2*(H-1) x 2*W => 2*(6-1) x 2*6 = 10x12. Output is 12x12. Doesn't match.\n    *   What if it's just 2*H x 2*W? Train 1: 2*6 x 2*6 = 12x12. Matches! Train 2: 2*15 x 2*10 = 30x20. Output is 28x20. Doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nLet's reconsider the output size determination. Maybe it's related to the bounding box of the *kept* objects?\n*   **Train 1:** Kept objects BB: H=15, W=11. Output: 12x12.\n*   **Train 2:** Kept objects (Blue, Gray, Yellow, Magenta):\n    *   Blue: Rows 2-6, Cols 5-12\n    *   Gray1: Rows 2-3, Cols 16-17\n    *   Gray2: Rows 15-16, Cols 15-16\n    *   Yellow: Rows 8-13, Cols 11-18\n    *   Magenta: Rows 10-15, Cols 4-7\n    *   Combined BB: Min Row=2, Max Row=16. Min Col=4, Max Col=18. Height = 16-2+1 = 15. Width = 18-4+1 = 15.\n    *   So, kept objects BB is 15x15. Output is 28x20. Still no obvious relationship.\n\nLet's rethink the noise removal. Is it *always* orange and azure?\n*   Train 1: Orange (7) removed.\n*   Train 2: Azure (8) removed.\n*   In both cases, these were the only pixels with area 1. Let's stick with the \"remove objects with area 1\" hypothesis.\n\nWhat if the output grid size is related to the bounding box of the largest object *before* noise removal?\n*   Train 1: Red BB is 6x6. Output 12x12. (2*H, 2*W)\n*   Train 2: Green BB is 15x10. Output 28x20. (2*(H-1), 2*W)\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Let's look at the overall bounding box of *all* non-white pixels in the input.\n*   Train 1: MinR=0, MaxR=19. MinC=0, MaxC=14. H=20, W=15. (Grid size). Output 12x12.\n*   Train 2: MinR=0, MaxR=18. MinC=1, MaxC=29. H=19, W=29. (Grid size approx). Output 28x20.\n\nCould the output size be related to the bounding box of the largest object relative to the grid center? Or relative to the overall content bounding box?\n\nLet's assume the simple `2*H x 2*W` rule for the largest object's bounding box worked for Train 1 (6x6 -> 12x12) and try to figure out why Train 2 (15x10 -> 28x20) is different.\nMaybe the rule is `max(1, 2*(H-offset_h)) x max(1, 2*(W-offset_w))`?\nFor Train 1: offset_h=0, offset_w=0 -> 2*6 x 2*6 = 12x12.\nFor Train 2: offset_h=1, offset_w=0 -> 2*(15-1) x 2*(10-0) = 28x20.\nWhy would the offset be 1 for height in Train 2 but 0 otherwise?\nMaybe it depends on whether H or W is >= some threshold? Or odd/even?\nTrain 1: H=6, W=6. Both even.\nTrain 2: H=15, W=10. H is odd, W is even.\nHypothesis: Output H = `2*H` if H is even, `2*(H-1)` if H is odd. Output W = `2*W` if W is even, `2*(W-1)` if W is odd.\n*   Train 1: H=6 (even), W=6 (even) -> `2*6` x `2*6` = 12x12. Matches.\n*   Train 2: H=15 (odd), W=10 (even) -> `2*(15-1)` x `2*10` = 28x20. Matches.\nThis looks promising for the output grid size determination!\n\n**Placement:**\nHow are the kept objects placed in the output grid? It seems their relative positions are maintained.\nLet's define the bounding box of the largest object (LBB). Let its top-left corner be (r_l, c_l).\nLet the bounding box of a kept object be (KBB). Let its top-left corner be (r_k, c_k).\nThe relative position of the kept object w.r.t the largest object is (r_k - r_l, c_k - c_l).\n\nLet the output grid dimensions be H_out, W_out.\nMaybe the kept object K is drawn in the output grid such that its top-left pixel's coordinate (r_out, c_out) is related to its original relative position?\nIf the output size is doubled (approximately), maybe the relative coordinates are doubled too?\nOutput top-left `(r_out, c_out)` = `(2 * (r_k - r_l), 2 * (c_k - c_l))`? Let's test.\n\n*   **Train 1:**\n    *   Largest (Red) BB: (0, 0) to (5, 5). Top-left (r_l, c_l) = (0, 0).\n    *   Output grid size: 12x12.\n    *   Kept Azure BB: (3, 7) to (6, 10). Top-left (r_k, c_k) = (3, 7). Relative = (3, 7). Doubled = (6, 14). Output BB starts at (2, 2). Doesn't match.\n    *   Kept Blue BB: (10, 2) to (11, 3). Top-left (r_k, c_k) = (10, 2). Relative = (10, 2). Doubled = (20, 4). Output BB starts at (2, 8). Doesn't match.\n    *   Kept Green BB: (11, 9) to (17, 12). Top-left (r_k, c_k) = (11, 9). Relative = (11, 9). Doubled = (22, 18). Output BB starts at (6, 4) [based on pixel (6,4)=3]. Doesn't match.\n\nThis placement logic is wrong.\n\nAlternative Placement Logic:\nMaybe the output grid represents a \"zoomed in\" view centered around the largest object?\nOr, find the bounding box containing *all* relevant objects (largest + kept). Call this the Content Bounding Box (CBB).\n*   Train 1: CBB (Red, Azure, Blue, Green): Rows 0-17, Cols 0-12. H=18, W=13.\n*   Train 2: CBB (Green, Blue, Gray, Yellow, Magenta): Rows 0-16, Cols 4-29. H=17, W=26.\n\nPerhaps the output grid is sized based on the largest object's BB (using the odd/even rule), but the objects are placed relative to the CBB's top-left corner, scaled somehow?\n\nLet CBB top-left be (r_cbb, c_cbb).\nLet Kept object K top-left be (r_k, c_k).\nRelative position within CBB: (r_k - r_cbb, c_k - c_cbb).\n\n*   **Train 1:** CBB top-left = (0, 0). Output size 12x12.\n    *   Azure: Relative = (3, 7). Output starts at (2, 2).\n    *   Blue: Relative = (10, 2). Output starts at (2, 8).\n    *   Green: Relative = (11, 9). Output starts at (6, 4).\n*   **Train 2:** CBB top-left = (0, 4). Output size 28x20.\n    *   Blue: Input TL=(2, 5). Relative = (2-0, 5-4) = (2, 1). Output starts at (18, 2).\n    *   Gray1: Input TL=(2, 16). Relative = (2, 12). Output starts at (2, 2).\n    *   Gray2: Input TL=(15, 15). Relative = (15, 11). Output starts at (21, 14).\n    *   Yellow: Input TL=(8, 11). Relative = (8, 7). Output starts at (4, 10).\n    *   Magenta: Input TL=(10, 4). Relative = (10, 0). Output starts at (10, 8).\n\nThis relative positioning doesn't seem to scale directly either.\n\nLet's focus on the output grid content. The shapes seem perfectly preserved, just moved.\nConsider the bounding box of the *output* objects.\n*   **Train 1:** Azure (2,2)-(5,5), Blue (2,8)-(3,9), Green (6,4)-(10,9). Overall output BB: (2,2) to (10,9). H=9, W=8.\n*   **Train 2:** Blue(18,2)-(25,7), Gray1(2,2)-(3,3), Gray2(21,14)-(22,15), Yellow(4,10)-(9,17), Magenta(10,8)-(15,11). Overall output BB: (2,2) to (25,17). H=24, W=16.\n\nMaybe the process is:\n1.  Filter noise (area=1 objects, or specifically orange/azure?). Let's assume area=1 for now.\n2.  Find the largest remaining object (L). Get its color (C_bg) and bounding box (LBB).\n3.  Identify all other remaining objects (K_i).\n4.  Calculate the bounding box containing all K_i (KBB_all). Let its dimensions be H_k, W_k and top-left (r_k_all, c_k_all).\n5.  Calculate the output grid size (H_out, W_out) based on LBB dimensions (H_l, W_l) using the odd/even rule: H_out = 2*H_l if H_l even else 2*(H_l-1); W_out = 2*W_l if W_l even else 2*(W_l-1).\n6.  Create an output grid of size (H_out, W_out) filled with C_bg.\n7.  Create a temporary canvas of size (H_k, W_k).\n8.  Draw each kept object K_i onto the temporary canvas at its relative position (r_k_i - r_k_all, c_k_i - c_k_all).\n9.  Paste this temporary canvas onto the center of the output grid?\n    *   Train 1: Output 12x12. Canvas (KBB_all) 15x11. Canvas is larger than output? No, this isn't right. KBB_all comes from input coords.\n    *   Train 1: Kept objects: Azure BB(3,7)-(6,10), Blue BB(10,2)-(11,3), Green BB(11,9)-(17,12). KBB_all = (3, 2) to (17, 12). H=15, W=11.\n    *   Train 2: Kept objects: Blue, Gray1, Gray2, Yellow, Magenta. KBB_all = (2, 4) to (16, 18). H=15, W=15.\n\nLet's reconsider the core idea: the output seems to be a composition.\nMaybe the output grid size is determined by the *bounding box of the kept objects*?\n*   Train 1: KBB_all is 15x11. Output is 12x12.\n*   Train 2: KBB_all is 15x15. Output is 28x20.\n\nThis doesn't fit either. Back to the largest object determining the size.\n*   Train 1: LBB=6x6. -> Output=12x12. (Rule: H_out=2H_l if H_l even else 2(H_l-1), W_out=2W_l if W_l even else 2(W_l-1)).\n*   Train 2: LBB=15x10. -> Output=28x20. Matches rule.\n\nLet's assume this size rule is correct. How are objects placed?\nMaybe the objects are placed relative to the *center* of the LBB, and then scaled?\nLBB Center (approx): `(r_l + H_l/2, c_l + W_l/2)`\nKept Object K Center (approx): `(r_k + H_k/2, c_k + W_k/2)`\nRelative Center Vector: `( (r_k + H_k/2) - (r_l + H_l/2), (c_k + W_k/2) - (c_l + W_l/2) )`\nOutput Center: `(H_out/2, W_out/2)`\nOutput K Top-Left = `( Output Center_r + 2 * Relative Center Vector_r - H_k/2 , Output Center_c + 2 * Relative Center Vector_c - W_k/2 )`? This seems overly complex.\n\nSimpler placement: Map the bounding box of the largest object (LBB) to the output grid.\nLBB: (r_l, c_l) to (r_l+H_l-1, c_l+W_l-1)\nOutput Grid: (0, 0) to (H_out-1, W_out-1)\n\nMap a point (r, c) from the input within the influence region to the output?\nInfluence region could be the LBB or the CBB (content bounding box).\n\nLet's try mapping CBB to the output grid.\n*   Train 1: CBB=(0,0)-(17,12) [H=18, W=13]. Output=(0,0)-(11,11) [H=12, W=12].\n*   Train 2: CBB=(0,4)-(16,18) [H=17, W=15]. Output=(0,0)-(27,19) [H=28, W=20]. Note: I recalculated CBB for Train 2 to include *only* kept objects + largest: Green BB(0,20)-(14,29), Blue BB(2,5)-(6,12), Gray1 BB(2,16)-(3,17), Gray2 BB(15,15)-(16,16), Yellow BB(8,11)-(13,18), Magenta BB(10,4)-(15,7). MinR=0, MaxR=16. MinC=4, MaxC=29. H=17, W=26. My previous CBB calculation for Train 2 was wrong. CBB=(0,4)-(16,29) [H=17, W=26]. Output = 28x20.\n\nThere's no simple scaling factor between CBB and Output Grid dimensions.\n\nLet's look at the specific locations in Train 1 again.\nInput: Red BB (0,0)-(5,5). Azure BB (3,7)-(6,10). Blue BB (10,2)-(11,3). Green BB (11,9)-(17,12).\nOutput: Size 12x12. Background Red. Azure (2,2)-(5,5). Blue (2,8)-(3,9). Green (6,4)-(10,9).\n\nConsider the relative position of the *top-left corner* of each kept object's BB to the *top-left corner* of the largest object's BB.\n*   Azure relative to Red: (3-0, 7-0) = (3, 7)\n*   Blue relative to Red: (10-0, 2-0) = (10, 2)\n*   Green relative to Red: (11-0, 9-0) = (11, 9)\n\nNow look at the output placement relative to the output grid origin (0, 0).\n*   Azure TL: (2, 2)\n*   Blue TL: (2, 8)\n*   Green TL: (6, 4) (based on pixel at (6,4))\n\nIs there a transformation from (Input Relative TL) to (Output TL)?\n(3, 7) -> (2, 2)\n(10, 2) -> (2, 8)\n(11, 9) -> (6, 4)\n\nThis doesn't look like simple scaling or translation.\n\nWhat if the noise pixels (area 1) define something?\nTrain 1: Orange (7) pixels at (0,8), (3,13), (7,1), (8,7), (12,5), (15,2), (15,13), (17,6), (19,12).\nTrain 2: Azure (8) pixels at (0,14), (3,1), (6,1), (8,7), (15,20), (15,24), (17,9), (18,27).\nThey seem randomly scattered. They don't seem to define a frame or center point.\n\nLet's reconsider the steps.\n1. Identify objects by color, position, and size (area).\n2. Filter out \"noise\" objects (area=1, or specific colors like orange/azure?). Hypothesis: Area=1.\n3. Identify the largest remaining object (L). Use its color for the output background. Note its bounding box (LBB).\n4. Identify all other remaining objects (K_i).\n5. Calculate output grid size (H_out, W_out) from LBB (H_l, W_l) using the H/W even/odd rule: `H_out=2*H_l if H_l%2==0 else 2*(H_l-1)`, `W_out=2*W_l if W_l%2==0 else 2*(W_l-1)`. Exception: if H_l or W_l is 1, maybe the output is 1? No, smallest LBB was 6x6. Let's assume H_out, W_out >= 1.\n6. Create the output grid filled with the background color.\n7. For each kept object K_i: Find its representation relative to some origin in the input. Transform these relative coordinates to output coordinates. Draw the object.\n\nWhat is the origin? What is the transformation?\nMaybe the origin is the top-left of LBB.\nMaybe the transformation involves scaling by 2?\n\nLet K_i have pixels `{(r, c)}`.\nLet LBB top-left be `(r_l, c_l)`.\nRelative input pixel coordinates: `{(r - r_l, c - c_l)}` for `(r, c)` in K_i.\nOutput pixel coordinates: `{ ( 2*(r - r_l) + dr , 2*(c - c_l) + dc ) }` ? What are dr, dc?\n\nLet's test this scaling idea on Train 1:\nLBB TL = (0, 0). Output size 12x12.\nAzure: Input pixels relative to (0,0) are e.g., (3, 10), (4, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8), ...\nScaled coordinates (x2): (6, 20), (8, 18), (10, 16), (12, 16), ... These go way outside the 12x12 output.\n\nThis scaling idea is likely wrong.\n\nWhat if we find the bounding box containing *only the kept objects* (KBB_all)?\n* Train 1: KBB_all = (3, 2) to (17, 12). H=15, W=11.\n* Train 2: KBB_all = (2, 4) to (16, 18). H=15, W=15. (Recalculated again just for kept).\n\nAnd we map KBB_all onto the output grid? No, sizes don't match.\n\nLet's assume the output size calculation is correct.\nLet's look at the *center* of the LBB relative to the input grid, and the *center* of the K objects relative to the input grid.\n\nMaybe the process involves creating a temporary grid based on LBB size, placing objects relative to LBB, and then scaling that grid?\n\nAlternative: Look at the output structure.\n*   Train 1: Output 12x12. Objects: Azure (2,2)-(5,5), Blue (2,8)-(3,9), Green (6,4)-(10,9).\n*   Train 2: Output 28x20. Objects: Blue(18,2)-(25,7), Gray1(2,2)-(3,3), Gray2(21,14)-(22,15), Yellow(4,10)-(9,17), Magenta(10,8)-(15,11).\n\nConsider Train 1. Output is 12x12. LBB was 6x6.\nImagine the 6x6 LBB mapped to the 12x12 output. Each pixel (r_l, c_l) in LBB maps to a 2x2 block in the output at `(2*r_l, 2*c_l)`.\nNow consider a kept object K. Find the pixels of K that *overlap* or are *adjacent* to the LBB in the input.\nTake those relative positions and scale them by 2 for the output?\n\nLet's check adjacency/overlap for Train 1:\nLBB: (0,0)-(5,5) (Red)\nAzure: (3,7)-(6,10). Adjacent. Closest point (3,6) vs (3,7). Relative vector (0, 1). Scaled (0, 2).\nBlue: (10,2)-(11,3). Not adjacent. Closest point (6,2) vs (10,2). Relative vector (4, 0). Scaled (8, 0).\nGreen: (11,9)-(17,12). Not adjacent. Closest point (6,5) vs (11,9). Relative vector (5, 4). Scaled (10, 8).\n\nOutput positions: Azure TL(2,2), Blue TL(2,8), Green TL(6,4).\nThis closest-point scaling doesn't seem right either.\n\nLet's step back and simplify.\n1. Remove noise (area 1 objects).\n2. Find the largest object L (by area). Its color C is the output background. Its bounding box is LBB (Hl x Wl).\n3. Find all other objects K_i.\n4. Determine output size (Ho x Wo) based on Hl, Wl (even/odd rule).\n5. Create output grid filled with C.\n6. Determine the \"composite\" shape formed by all K_i. Find its bounding box KBB_all (Hk x Wk), top-left (rk_all, ck_all).\n7. Create a temporary canvas C_k of size Hk x Wk.\n8. Draw each K_i onto C_k at `(r_ki - rk_all, c_ki - ck_all)`.\n9. Determine where to place C_k onto the output grid.\n\nMaybe C_k is placed such that its center aligns with the output grid center?\n*   Train 1: Output 12x12 (center ~5.5, 5.5). C_k is 15x11 (center ~7, 5). TL offset = (5.5-7, 5.5-5) = (-1.5, 0.5). So C_k TL at (-1.5, 0.5) in output? Doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe C_k is placed such that the relative position of KBB_all to LBB is somehow preserved and scaled onto the output grid?\n\nConsider the transformation from Input Coordinates to Output Coordinates.\nIt seems objects maintain their shape and color (except L).\nTheir positions change.\nThe grid size changes based on LBB.\nThe background changes based on L's color.\n\nCould it be as simple as:\n1. Find L (largest, non-noise), K_i (other non-noise).\n2. Calculate output size H_o, W_o from LBB.\n3. Create output grid with L's color.\n4. For each K_i, find its top-left corner (r_k, c_k).\n5. Calculate an output top-left corner (r_out, c_out). How?\n6. Draw K_i starting at (r_out, c_out).\n\nLet's look at the output bounding boxes again.\nTrain 1 Output: Overall BB (2,2) to (10,9). H=9, W=8. Output grid 12x12. Padding: Top=2, Bottom=1, Left=2, Right=2.\nTrain 2 Output: Overall BB (2,2) to (25,17). H=24, W=16. Output grid 28x20. Padding: Top=2, Bottom=2, Left=2, Right=2.\n\nPadding seems consistent (2 pixels)! This is a strong clue.\n\nRevised Hypothesis:\n1. Identify noise objects (area 1) and remove them.\n2. Find the largest remaining object L. Get its color C_bg and bounding box LBB (Hl x Wl).\n3. Identify all other remaining objects K_i.\n4. Calculate the bounding box containing all K_i (KBB_all). Let its dimensions be Hk x Wk, and top-left (rk_all, ck_all).\n5. Create a temporary canvas `C_temp` of size (Hk x Wk). Draw each K_i onto `C_temp` relative to its top-left, i.e., K_i pixels `(r, c)` are drawn at `(r - rk_all, c - ck_all)` on `C_temp`.\n6. Determine the final output grid size: `H_out = Hk + 4`, `W_out = Wk + 4`. (Adding 2px padding on each side).\n7. Create the final output grid of size (H_out, W_out), filled with C_bg.\n8. Paste the `C_temp` canvas onto the output grid starting at index (2, 2).\n\nLet's test this:\n*   **Train 1:**\n    *   Noise: Orange (7), area 1. Remove.\n    *   Largest: Red (2), area 28. C_bg = Red(2).\n    *   Kept (K_i): Azure(8), Blue(1), Green(3).\n    *   KBB_all: (3, 2) to (17, 12). Hk = 17-3+1 = 15. Wk = 12-2+1 = 11.\n    *   Output size: H_out = 15 + 4 = 19. W_out = 11 + 4 = 15.\n    *   Actual Output size: 12x12. **Hypothesis fails.**\n\nOkay, the padding idea related to KBB_all was wrong. Let's stick to the output size determined by LBB.\n\nLBB Size -> Output Size Rule:\nH_out = 2*Hl if Hl%2==0 else 2*(Hl-1)\nW_out = 2*Wl if Wl%2==0 else 2*(Wl-1)\n(Seems reliable for both examples).\n\nPadding Observation: The content in the output grid seems to start at (2, 2).\nTrain 1 Output: Content BB (2,2) to (10,9).\nTrain 2 Output: Content BB (2,2) to (25,17).\nThe top-left corner of the combined output shape is always (2, 2).\n\nRevised Hypothesis 2:\n1. Identify noise objects (area 1) and remove them.\n2. Find the largest remaining object L. Get its color C_bg and bounding box LBB (Hl x Wl).\n3. Identify all other remaining objects K_i.\n4. Calculate output grid size (H_out, W_out) from LBB (Hl, Wl) using the H/W even/odd rule.\n5. Create the final output grid of size (H_out, W_out), filled with C_bg.\n6. Find the bounding box containing all K_i (KBB_all). Let its top-left corner be (rk_all, ck_all).\n7. For each kept object K_i, iterate through its pixels `(r, c)`.\n8. Calculate the position of this pixel relative to the top-left of KBB_all: `rel_r = r - rk_all`, `rel_c = c - ck_all`.\n9. Calculate the output position by adding the offset (2, 2): `out_r = rel_r + 2`, `out_c = rel_c + 2`.\n10. Set the pixel `(out_r, out_c)` in the output grid to the color of K_i.\n\nLet's test this:\n*   **Train 1:**\n    *   Noise: Orange (7). Remove.\n    *   Largest: Red (2). C_bg = Red(2). LBB (0,0)-(5,5). Hl=6, Wl=6.\n    *   Kept: Azure, Blue, Green.\n    *   Output Size: Ho=2*6=12, Wo=2*6=12. (Matches).\n    *   Create 12x12 grid filled with Red(2).\n    *   KBB_all: (3, 2) to (17, 12). rk_all=3, ck_all=2.\n    *   Consider Azure object. A pixel at (3, 10). Relative=(3-3, 10-2)=(0, 8). Output=(0+2, 8+2)=(2, 10).\n    *   Consider Blue object. A pixel at (10, 2). Relative=(10-3, 2-2)=(7, 0). Output=(7+2, 0+2)=(9, 2).\n    *   Consider Green object. A pixel at (11, 9). Relative=(11-3, 9-2)=(8, 7). Output=(8+2, 7+2)=(10, 9).\n    *   Let's check these output coords against the actual output grid:\n        *   Actual Azure TL is (2, 2). Pixel (3,10) in input -> (2,10) in output? Looking at output grid, pixel (2, 10) is Red(2). The Azure shape is at (2,2) to (5,5). A pixel like input (3,10) corresponds to output (2,5)."
