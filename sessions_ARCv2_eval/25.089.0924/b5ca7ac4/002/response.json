            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    *   The core hypothesis that the input grid is divided into a 3x3 grid of regions, and the content of these regions is permuted according to a fixed map, appears correct based on visual inspection of all examples.\n    *   The previous code failed because it attempted direct slice assignment (`output[slice1] = input[slice2]`) where `slice1` and `slice2` were derived from the grid division by 3. This division does not always produce regions of identical size (due to integer division remainders), leading to shape mismatches (`ValueError: could not broadcast...`). For example, a 22x22 grid divides into regions of shapes (7,7), (7,8), (8,7), and (8,8). Permuting these regions resulted in attempts to assign a subgrid of one shape into a slice expecting another shape.\n    *   The strategy for resolution is to refine the copying process:\n        1.  Accurately calculate the boundaries of the 9 input regions based on integer division of height and width by 3.\n        2.  Identify the fixed permutation map between input region indices and output region indices.\n        3.  Iterate through the input regions. For each input region:\n            *   Extract the subgrid corresponding to the input region.\n            *   Determine the top-left coordinates of the target output region using the permutation map and the calculated region boundaries.\n            *   Paste the extracted input subgrid into the output grid starting at the target top-left coordinates. This ensures the shape of the data being pasted matches the shape of the target slice in the output grid.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   Let's confirm the dimensions and calculate the resulting region sizes for each training example.\n"
