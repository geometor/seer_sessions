task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions: Consistent between input and output.
    - background_color: Persists from input to output. Varies between examples (White, Yellow, Blue).
  elements:
    - type: regions
      description: The grid is conceptually divided into a 3x3 grid of 9 roughly equal rectangular regions.
      properties:
        - size: Determined by dividing the input grid's height and width by 3. Let H, W be input dimensions. Region row boundaries are roughly at 0, H/3, 2H/3, H. Region column boundaries are roughly at 0, W/3, 2W/3, W.
        - content: Each region contains a subgrid of pixels from the input grid, which might include parts of objects or just background color.
  transformation:
    type: region_permutation
    description: The content of the 9 input regions is copied to 9 output regions according to a fixed permutation map.
    permutation_map (input_region_index -> output_region_index): # Using 1-based indexing for clarity, (row, col)
      (1,1) -> (1,1)
      (1,2) -> (1,3)
      (1,3) -> (2,1)
      (2,1) -> (2,2)
      (2,2) -> (2,3)
      (2,3) -> (3,2)
      (3,1) -> (3,3)
      (3,2) -> (3,1)
      (3,3) -> (1,2)
    output_grid:
      - dimensions: Same as input.
      - content: Constructed by placing the permuted region contents into their new locations.
