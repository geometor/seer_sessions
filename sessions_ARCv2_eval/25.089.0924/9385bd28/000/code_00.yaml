task_description: Fill enclosed background areas based on border color and largest interior object color.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains: objects

  - type: object
    properties:
      - shape: contiguous block of non-white pixels
      - role:
          - boundary (forms a closed loop)
          - interior_object (located inside a loop)
          - exterior_object (located outside any loop)

relationships:
  - type: enclosure
    subject: boundary_object (loop)
    object: interior_region (pixels inside the loop)
    properties:
      - interior_region contains:
          - white (0) pixels
          - optionally, interior_objects

actions:
  - action: identify_loops
    input: grid
    output: list of boundary_objects (loops) and their corresponding interior_regions

  - action: identify_largest_interior_object
    input: interior_region
    output: color of the largest non-white object within the region (or null if none)

  - action: determine_fill_color
    input:
      - boundary_object_color
      - largest_interior_object_color (or null)
    output: fill_color
    logic: Mapped based on observed pairs:
             (Border: Red 2, Inner: Blue 1) -> Fill: Green 3
             (Border: Yellow 4, Inner: Blue 1) -> Fill: Gray 5
             (Border: Red 2, Inner: Yellow 4) -> Fill: Maroon 9
             (Border: Blue 1, Inner: null) -> Fill: Magenta 6
             (Border: Green 3, Inner: null) -> Fill: Green 3
             (Border: Magenta 6, Inner: null) -> Fill: Orange 7
             (Border: Yellow 4, Inner: null) -> Fill: Yellow 4
             (Border: Orange 7, Inner: null) -> Fill: Magenta 6

  - action: fill_interior_background
    input:
      - grid
      - loop_boundary
      - interior_region
      - fill_color
    output: modified_grid
    effect: Changes the color of white (0) pixels within the interior_region to the fill_color.

final_state: The output grid reflects the input grid with all white pixels inside identified loops filled according to the determined fill color. Loop pixels and interior object pixels remain unchanged.
