            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code failed completely on all training examples, producing the input grid as output in every case. This indicates a fundamental failure in the core logic, specifically in identifying the enclosed white regions. The conditions used (`touches_boundary`, checking `adjacent_object_labels`) were insufficient to correctly determine which white areas were truly enclosed by a single, continuous, non-white border.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Refine Enclosure Detection:** Implement a more robust method, likely using a flood-fill algorithm starting from white pixels. This fill should check if it reaches the grid edge (meaning not enclosed) and simultaneously identify the color(s) of the immediate non-white neighbors. An area is considered enclosed if the fill does not reach the edge and all non-white neighbors belong to a single contiguous object (which implies a single color).\n2.  **Verify Interior Object Logic:** Once enclosure is correctly identified, re-verify the logic for finding the largest interior object (non-white, non-border color) within the enclosed area.\n3.  **Confirm Fill Map:** Ensure the `fill_map` derived from the examples correctly captures all observed transformations.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nLet's re-examine the examples to confirm the expected behavior and fill rules.\n\n"

Identify all distinct connected regions of white (0) pixels in the input grid.\n3.  For each white region:\n    a.  Check if any pixel of the white region lies on the outermost border (row 0, last row, column 0, last column) of the grid. If it does, this region is not enclosed; skip to the next white region.\n    b.  Determine the set of unique, contiguous, non-white objects that are directly adjacent (orthogonally) to any pixel in the current white region.\n    c.  If this set contains *exactly one* non-white object (the `border_loop`), then the white region is considered `enclosed`. Note the color of this `border_loop` (the `border_color`) and the coordinates of the `enclosed` white region.\n    d.  If the white region is not bordered by exactly one non-white object, it is not enclosed by a single loop; skip to the next white region.\n4.  For each `enclosed` white region identified in step 3:\n    a.  Identify all distinct, contiguous objects located strictly *within* the coordinates of the `enclosed` region.\n    b.  Filter these interior objects, keeping only those whose color is *not* white (0) and *not* equal to the `border_color` identified in step 3c.\n    c.  If one or more valid interior objects remain after filtering, find the object with the largest number of pixels. Let its color be `largest_interior_object_color`.\n    d.  If no valid interior objects remain after filtering (i.e., the interior contains only white pixels or pixels matching the `border_color`), set `largest_interior_object_color` to `None`.\n    e.  Determine the `fill_color` using the following fixed mapping based on the `border_color` and the `largest_interior_object_color` (or `None`):\n        *   (Border: Red 2, Interior: Blue 1) -> Fill: Green 3\n        *   (Border: Yellow 4, Interior: Blue 1) -> Fill: Gray 5\n        *   (Border: Red 2, Interior: Yellow 4) -> Fill: Maroon 9\n        *   (Border: Blue 1, Interior: None) -> Fill: Magenta 6\n        *   (Border: Green 3, Interior: None) -> Fill: Green 3\n        *   (Border: Magenta 6, Interior: None) -> Fill: Orange 7\n        *   (Border: Yellow 4, Interior: None) -> Fill: Yellow 4\n        *   (Border: Orange 7, Interior: None) -> Fill: Magenta 6\n    f.  For every pixel coordinate within the `enclosed` white region, change the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid to the determined `fill_color`.\n5.  Return the final modified output grid."
