The transformation operates based on the total counts of Red(2) and White(0) pixels in the grid.

1. Count the total number of Red pixels (`count_red`).
2. Count the total number of White pixels (`count_white`).
3. Determine the transformation rule:
    - If `count_red > 1` AND `count_white > 1`, use Rule B.
    - Otherwise (if either count is 0 or 1), use Rule A.
4. Apply the selected rule pixel-wise:
    - Rule A: Red(2) becomes White(0), White(0) becomes Blue(1), Blue(1) remains Blue(1). Other colors are unchanged.
    - Rule B: Red(2) remains Red(2), White(0) becomes Blue(1), Blue(1) becomes White(0). Other colors are unchanged.

Note: This hypothesis correctly matches examples 2, 3, and 4, but incorrectly predicts Rule B for example 1 (which expects Rule A). This
