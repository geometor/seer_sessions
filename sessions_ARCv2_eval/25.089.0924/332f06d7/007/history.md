Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved in the transformation are Red (2), White (0), and Blue (1). Green (3) acts as a background or neutral color, remaining unchanged in all examples.
2.  **Objects:** The transformation seems to focus on contiguous blocks (objects) of Red, White, and Blue pixels. These objects vary in size (1x1, 2x2, 3x3) across examples.
3.  **Transformation Type:** The core operation is a pixel-wise color change applied to Red, White, and/or Blue pixels. The specific changes depend on a condition related to the input grid's composition.
4.  **Conditional Logic:** There appear to be two distinct transformation rules. The rule applied depends on the number of distinct objects of each color (Red, White, Blue) present in the input.
    *   In examples 2 and 3, there is exactly one distinct object of Red, one of White, and one of Blue. In these cases, White pixels become Blue, and Blue pixels become White, while Red pixels remain unchanged.
    *   In examples 1 and 4, the condition of having exactly one object of each color (Red, White, Blue) is *not* met (specifically, there isn't one distinct Blue object separate from other blue structures). In these cases, Red pixels become White, White pixels become Blue, and Blue pixels remain unchanged.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
Task: Conditional Color Transformation

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (0-9).
  - Colors:
      - Active: Red (2), White (0), Blue (1)
      - Background: Green (3) (and potentially others, though only Green appears here)
  - Objects: Contiguous blocks of a single active color (Red, White, or Blue).
  - Object_Counts: The number of distinct, isolated objects found for each active color.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Transformed 2D array of pixels.

Transformation:
  - Type: Pixel-wise color substitution based on a global condition.
  - Condition: Check if the number of distinct Red objects = 1 AND the number of distinct White objects = 1 AND the number of distinct Blue objects = 1.
  - Rules:
      - If Condition is True:
          - Red (2) -> Red (2)
          - White (0) -> Blue (1)
          - Blue (1) -> White (0)
          - Other_Colors -> Other_Colors (e.g., Green (3) -> Green (3))
      - If Condition is False:
          - Red (2) -> White (0)
          - White (0) -> Blue (1)
          - Blue (1) -> Blue (1)
          - Other_Colors -> Other_Colors (e.g., Green (3) -> Green (3))
  - Scope: Applies to all pixels in the grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Analyze the input grid to identify all distinct, contiguous objects composed solely of Red (2), White (0), or Blue (1) pixels. Consider Green (3) pixels as background or separators.
2.  Count the number of these distinct objects for each color: `num_red_objects`, `num_white_objects`, `num_blue_objects`.
3.  Evaluate the condition: `is_condition_met = (num_red_objects == 1) AND (num_white_objects == 1) AND (num_blue_objects == 1)`.
4.  Create a new output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
5.  Iterate through each pixel `(row, col)` of the input grid:
    a.  Get the `input_color` at `(row, col)`.
    b.  If `is_condition_met` is True:
        i.  If `input_color` is White (0), set the output grid pixel at `(row, col)` to Blue (1).
        ii. If `input_color` is Blue (1), set the output grid pixel at `(row, col)` to White (0).
        iii. If `input_color` is Red (2) or any other color, keep the color unchanged in the output grid.
    c.  If `is_condition_met` is False:
        i.  If `input_color` is Red (2), set the output grid pixel at `(row, col)` to White (0).
        ii. If `input_color` is White (0), set the output grid pixel at `(row, col)` to Blue (1).
        iii. If `input_color` is Blue (1) or any other color, keep the color unchanged in the output grid.
6.  Return the completed output grid.

Transforms the input grid based on the connectivity of Blue (1) pixels.

The transformation rule depends on whether all Blue (1) pixels in the input grid
form a single contiguous object when considering only 4-way (horizontal and vertical)
connections.

1. Identify all distinct groups (objects) of Blue pixels using 4-way connectivity.
2. Count the number of these distinct Blue objects.
3. Check the condition: Is the number of Blue objects exactly 1?

4. If the condition is TRUE (exactly one 4-way connected Blue object):
    - Change all White pixels (0) to Blue (1).
    - Change all Blue pixels (1) to White (0).
    - Keep Red pixels (2) and all other colors unchanged.
5. If the condition is FALSE (more than one 4-way connected Blue object):
    - Change all Red pixels (2) to White (0).
    - Change all White pixels (0) to Blue (1).
    - Keep Blue pixels (1) and all other colors unchanged.

**Conclusion from Code Execution:**

My visual inspection was wrong. The `count_objects_4way` function *correctly* identifies that *all* blue pixels in *all* examples form a single contiguous object when using 4-way connectivity.

This means the condition `is_single_blue_object = (num_blue_objects == 1)` is *always* TRUE for these examples.

Therefore, the code *always* executed the `if is_single_blue_object:` block, which applies Rule B:
*   Rule B: Red -> Red, White -> Blue, Blue -> White

Let's re-check the expected outputs against Rule B:
*   Example 1 Expected: Red -> White (0), White -> Blue (1), Blue -> Blue (1) --- **This is Rule A!**
*   Example 2 Expected: Red -> Red (2), White -> Blue (1), Blue -> White (0) --- **This is Rule B!**
*   Example 3 Expected: Red -> Red (2), White -> Blue (1), Blue -> White (0) --- **This is Rule B!**
*   Example 4 Expected: Red -> White (0), White -> Blue (1), Blue -> Blue (1) --- **This is Rule A!**

So, the actual discriminating factor is *not* the 4-way connectivity of blue pixels. We need a new condition that is TRUE for examples 2 & 3, and FALSE for examples 1 & 4.

**New Hypothesis Exploration:**

Let's gather metrics using the code execution tool.

*   **Metric 1: Number of objects (8-way connectivity)**
*   **Metric 2: Pixel counts (Red, White, Blue)**
*   **Metric 3: Adjacency (8-way) between colors** (Red-White, Red-Blue, White-Blue)

**Analysis of Metrics:**

*   `Obj_Red (8w)`, `Obj_White (8w)`, `Obj_Blue (8w)`: All are 1 for all examples. This doesn't distinguish the rules.
*   `Count_Red`, `Count_White`, `Count_Blue`: The counts vary, but there's no obvious pattern (e.g., threshold) matching Rule A vs Rule B.
*   `Adj_RW (8w)`: Always False.
*   `Adj_RB (8w)`: Always True.
*   `Adj_WB (8w)`: Always True.

None of these metrics alone seem to explain the difference. Let's reconsider the original hypothesis about object counts, but perhaps with a stricter definition or combination.

**Revisiting the First Hypothesis (Number of Distinct Objects):**
My first hypothesis was: Condition = (num_red == 1) AND (num_white == 1) AND (num_blue == 1).
The `tool_code` output shows that using 8-way connectivity (`Obj_* (8w)` columns), this condition is TRUE for ALL examples. This can't be the distinguishing factor.

**What if the object definition is stricter?**
Perhaps "object" means something specific here. In ARC, background colors often separate objects. Green (3) is the background.

Let's re-examine the grids visually, focusing on Green (3) as a separator.

*   **Example 1 (Rule A):** Red(2) object is separated by Green(3). White(0) object is separated. Blue(1) pixels seem connected, but *also* appear in multiple places separated by Green(3). *However*, the `label` function (with 8-way) found only 1 object. This implies all Blue pixels *are* connected diagonally or side-by-side, even if it looks visually separated by Green.
*   **Example 2 (Rule B):** Red, White, Blue objects all look like single contiguous blocks separated by Green. `label` confirms 1 object each (8-way).
*   **Example 3 (Rule B):** Similar to Example 2. Red, White, Blue objects look contiguous and separated by Green. `label` confirms 1 object each (8-way).
*   **Example 4 (Rule A):** Red(2) is a single pixel. White(0) is a single pixel. Blue(1) pixels appear in multiple places separated by Green. `label` confirms 1 object each (8-way).

**The Key Difference:**
The condition might not be about the *number* of objects, but about their *nature* or *relationship*.

Let's look at the *location* of the objects relative to each other.
*   Rule A (Ex 1, 4): Red, White, Blue objects exist.
*   Rule B (Ex 2, 3): Red, White, Blue objects exist.

Consider adjacency *ignoring* the background Green(3). If we treat Green as empty space, are Red, White, and Blue components "close" or interacting in some way?

Let's revisit the idea of adjacency: `Adj_RB` and `Adj_WB` were always TRUE. This means in all examples, at least one Red pixel is next to a Blue pixel, and at least one White pixel is next to a Blue pixel.

**New Hypothesis:** The condition depends on whether *both* Red *and* White pixels are adjacent to *the same* Blue object. This seems difficult to check directly.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** Is there a unique property of the Blue object itself?
*   Example 1 (Rule A): Blue object is complex, snakes around.
*   Example 2 (Rule B): Blue object is relatively simple, mostly rectangular blocks.
*   Example 3 (Rule B): Blue object is complex, but looks like one main group.
*   Example 4 (Rule A): Blue object is fragmented into multiple visual clusters (even if technically connected via 8-way).

**Let's test the original "Number of Objects = 1 for each color" idea again, but using 4-WAY connectivity.**

**Result:** Using 4-way connectivity, the condition `(num_red == 1 and num_white == 1 and num_blue == 1)` is *also* TRUE for all examples. This hypothesis is also incorrect.

**Final Hypothesis before giving up on simple object counts/adjacency:**
Maybe the rule depends *only* on the Red pixels?
*   Example 1 (Rule A): Red object is 2x2 (4 pixels).
*   Example 2 (Rule B): Red object is 2x2 (4 pixels).
*   Example 3 (Rule B): Red object is 3x3 (9 pixels).
*   Example 4 (Rule A): Red object is 1x1 (1 pixel).

Condition could be: Is the Red object larger than 1x1 (i.e., `Count_Red > 1`)?
*   Ex 1: `Count_Red = 4` -> > 1 -> Predict Rule B? (Expected: A) - FAIL
*   Ex 2: `Count_Red = 4` -> > 1 -> Predict Rule B? (Expected: B) - OK
*   Ex 3: `Count_Red = 9` -> > 1 -> Predict Rule B? (Expected: B) - OK
*   Ex 4: `Count_Red = 1` -> <= 1 -> Predict Rule A? (Expected: A) - OK

This almost works, but fails on Example 1.

Let's reconsider the core difference between the groups {1, 4} and {2, 3}.
Group {1, 4} -> Rule A (Red->White, White->Blue, Blue->Blue)
Group {2, 3} -> Rule B (Red->Red, White->Blue, Blue->White)

What if the condition relates to *both* Red and White?
Condition: Are *both* the Red object *and* the White object larger than 1x1?
*   Ex 1: Red=4, White=4 -> Both > 1 -> Predict Rule B? (Expected A) - FAIL
*   Ex 2: Red=4, White=4 -> Both > 1 -> Predict Rule B? (Expected B) - OK
*   Ex 3: Red=9, White=9 -> Both > 1 -> Predict Rule B? (Expected B) - OK
*   Ex 4: Red=1, White=1 -> Both <= 1 -> Predict Rule A? (Expected A) - OK

Still fails on Example 1.

There must be a property I'm missing. Let's look at the outputs again.

Rule A (Ex 1, 4 outputs): Red becomes White, White becomes Blue, Blue stays Blue.
Rule B (Ex 2, 3 outputs): Red stays Red, White becomes Blue, Blue becomes White.

Notice that White *always* becomes Blue.
The difference lies in what happens to Red and Blue.
*   Rule A: Red -> White, Blue -> Blue
*   Rule B: Red -> Red, Blue -> White

What determines this switch?

Maybe it's about whether the Red and White objects are "similar" in some way?
*   Ex 1: Red is 2x2, White is 2x2. They are the *same size*. (Rule A applied)
*   Ex 2: Red is 2x2, White is 2x2. They are the *same size*. (Rule B applied)
*   Ex 3: Red is 3x3, White is 3x3. They are the *same size*. (Rule B applied)
*   Ex 4: Red is 1x1, White is 1x1. They are the *same size*. (Rule A applied)

This doesn't work either. All examples have Red and White objects of the same size.

**Thinking outside the box:** What if Green matters?
No, Green seems purely background.

What if the *position* matters? Is there some symmetry or alignment? Doesn't seem obvious.

**Let's try the initial failed code's condition again:** `is_single_blue_object (4-way)`
The code execution showed this was TRUE for all examples. Why did the code produce different outputs then?
Ah, I see the mistake in my previous analysis. I was looking at the *expected* output to determine which rule *should* have been applied. But the code *always* applied Rule B because the condition `is_single_blue_object` was always true.

Let's re-verify the transformed outputs from the failure report against Rule B (Red->Red, White->Blue, Blue->White):

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Red(2) -> Output Red(2) (Matches Rule B) - *Failure report showed 2->2*
    *   Input White(0) -> Output Blue(1) (Matches Rule B) - *Failure report showed 0->1*
    *   Input Blue(1) -> Output White(0) (Matches Rule B) - *Failure report showed 1->0*
    *   **Wait, the failure report *does* show Rule B was applied!** Why did it say "Match: False"? Because the *expected* output for Example 1 uses Rule A.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Red(2) -> Output Red(2)
    *   Input White(0) -> Output Blue(1)
    *   Input Blue(1) -> Output White(0)
    *   **The failure report shows Rule B was applied.** This matches the expected output for Example 2. Why did it fail? Let's compare pixels.
    *   Expected: `... 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3` (Row 3, middle) vs Actual: `... 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 3 3` (Row 3, middle) -> Input Blue(1) became White(0) as per Rule B. Input White(0) became Blue(1) as per Rule B. The failure must be elsewhere.
    *   Expected: `... 1 1 1 0 0 3 3 3 3` (Row 8, middle) vs Actual: `... 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3` (Row 8, middle) -> Input Blue(1) became White(0). Correct per Rule B.
    *   Okay, the failure report's "Transformed Output" for Example 2 *does* match Rule B application. The failure must be due to comparing it against the *Expected* output which also uses Rule B, but there's a subtle difference.
    *   Let's look very closely at Example 2 again.
    *   Input, Row 3: `... 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 3 3`
    *   Expected, Row 3: `... 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3` (Input White 0,0 became Blue 1,1; Input Blue 1,1,1,1,1 became White 0,0,0,0,0 - NO! Blue stays Blue!) Wait, why did I think Rule B applied here?
    *   **Rule B:** Red -> Red, White -> Blue, Blue -> White
    *   **Rule A:** Red -> White, White -> Blue, Blue -> Blue
    *   Example 2 Expected Output vs Input:
        *   Red(2) -> Red(2)
        *   White(0) [at (2,10),(2,11), (3,10),(3,11)] -> Blue(1) [at (2,10 to 16? NO! (2,10),(2,11)] -> Blue(1) -> Pixels (2,10),(2,11),(3,10),(3,11) go from 0 to 1.
        *   Blue(1) [at (2,5 to 9)] -> Blue(1) [at (2,5 to 9)]. Blue STAYS Blue.
        *   Blue(1) [at (7,8),(7,9), (8,8),(8,9)] -> White(0)? Yes, pixels (7,8),(7,9),(8,8),(8,9) go from 1 to 0 in the expected output.
    *   This is confusing. Some Blues change to White, some stay Blue? This contradicts both Rule A and Rule B as defined.

**Let's reconsider the transformation entirely.** Maybe it's not a simple global substitution.

What if only *certain* pixels change based on local context?

Look at Example 2 again:
Input:

```
... 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 ...  (Row 2/3)
... 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 ...  (Row 7/8)
... 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... (Row 10/11)
... 2 2 ...           (Row 12/13)
```

Output:

```
... 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...  (Row 2/3)  <- White became Blue
... 1 1 1 0 0 3 3 ...  (Row 7/8)  <- Some Blue became White
... 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... (Row 10/11) <- Blue stayed Blue
... 2 2 ...           (Row 12/13) <- Red stayed Red
```

Observations for Example 2:
*   Red stays Red.
*   White becomes Blue.
*   Some Blue becomes White, some Blue stays Blue.
    *   The Blue pixels that become White are the ones at (7,8), (7,9), (8,8), (8,9). What's special about them? In the input, they are adjacent to Green(3).
    *   The Blue pixels that stay Blue are:
        *   (2,5-9), (3,5-9): Adjacent to White(0) and Green(3).
        *   (4,5-6), (5,5-6), (6,5-6): Adjacent only to Green(3).
        *   (7,5-7), (8,5-7): Adjacent to Green(3).
        *   (9,9): Adjacent only to Green(3).
        *   (10,1-9), (11,1-9): Adjacent only to Green(3).

Hypothesis: Blue pixels become White *only if* they are adjacent (8-way) to a White pixel in the input?
Let's check:
*   Input(7,8)=1. Neighbors: (6,8)=1, (6,9)=1, (7,7)=1, (7,9)=1, (8,8)=1, (8,9)=1, (8,7)=1, (6,7)=3. No adjacent White(0). This hypothesis fails.

What if it's about adjacency to Red?
*   Input(7,8)=1. Neighbors do not include Red(2).

Maybe it's the *White* pixels that determine the Blue->White change?
The White pixels are at (2,10), (2,11), (3,10), (3,11).
Are the Blue pixels that change to White somehow "related" to the White pixels? No obvious path or shared property.

Let's step back. What is the simplest explanation? Two modes.
Mode A (Ex 1, 4): R->0, W->1, B->1
Mode B (Ex 2, 3): R->2, W->1, B->0

What triggers Mode A vs Mode B?
Let's check adjacency again, specifically between Red and White.
