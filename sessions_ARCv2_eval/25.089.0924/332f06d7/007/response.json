Count the total number of Red pixels (`count_red`).\n2. Count the total number of White pixels (`count_white`).\n3. Determine the transformation rule:\n    - If `count_red > 1` AND `count_white > 1`, use Rule B.\n    - Otherwise (if either count is 0 or 1), use Rule A.\n4. Apply the selected rule pixel-wise:\n    - Rule A: Red(2) becomes White(0), White(0) becomes Blue(1), Blue(1) remains Blue(1). Other colors are unchanged.\n    - Rule B: Red(2) remains Red(2), White(0) becomes Blue(1), Blue(1) becomes White(0). Other colors are unchanged.\n\nNote: This hypothesis correctly matches examples 2, 3, and 4, but incorrectly predicts Rule B for example 1 (which expects Rule A). This"
