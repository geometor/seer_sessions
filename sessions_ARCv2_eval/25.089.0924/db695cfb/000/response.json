This background color remains unchanged in the output.\n2.  **Key Objects:** The significant objects are individual pixels of blue (color 1) and magenta (color 6).\n3.  **Interaction:** The core transformation involves an interaction between the blue and magenta pixels, or between blue pixels themselves if no magenta pixels are present.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation results in new blue pixels being added to the grid, forming diagonal lines or paths. The original blue and magenta pixels always remain in their initial positions.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Keep a copy of the input grid as the starting point for the output grid.\n2.  Check if any magenta pixels exist.\n3.  **If magenta pixels exist:**\n    *   For each blue pixel at position (r_blue, c_blue):\n        *   Calculate the Manhattan distance to every magenta pixel.\n        *   Identify the magenta pixel at (r_magenta, c_magenta) with the minimum Manhattan distance. If there's a tie, any of the closest ones can be chosen (the examples seem deterministic, suggesting a consistent tie-breaking rule might exist, but the simplest rule is to pick the first one found or assume examples avoid ambiguous ties).\n        *   Determine the diagonal step direction (dr, dc) needed to move from blue towards the chosen magenta: dr = sign(r_magenta - r_blue), dc = sign(c_magenta - c_blue). Handle cases where dr or dc is 0 by skipping (though this shouldn't happen if they are truly diagonal targets, maybe re-evaluate \"nearest\" if non-diagonal occurs). Assume dr and dc will be +/- 1.\n        *   Initialize the path position (r, c) = (r_blue + dr, c_blue + dc).\n        *   While the current path position (r, c) is not on the same row or column as the target magenta pixel (i.e., while r != r_magenta and c != c_magenta):\n            *   Change the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the output grid to blue (1).\n            *   Update the path position: (r, c) = (r + dr, c + dc).\n4.  **If no magenta pixels exist:**\n    *   Check if there are exactly two blue pixels.\n    *   **If there are exactly two blue pixels:**\n        *   Let the positions be (r1, c1) and (r2, c2). Ensure (r1, c1) is the one with the smaller row index (swap if needed) to establish a consistent starting point.\n        *   Determine the diagonal step direction (dr, dc) from (r1, c1) to (r2, c2): dr = sign(r2 - r1), dc = sign(c2 - c1). Since we ensured r1 < r2, dr will be 1. dc will be +/- 1.\n        *   Initialize the path position (r, c) = (r1 + dr, c1 + dc).\n        *   While the current path position (r, c) is not equal to the second blue pixel's position (r2, c2):\n            *   Change the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the output grid to blue (1).\n            *   Update the path position: (r, c) = (r + dr, c + dc).\n    *   **If there are not exactly two blue pixels (0, 1, or >2):**\n        *   Do nothing; the output grid remains the same as the input grid copy.\n5.
