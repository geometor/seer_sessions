However, the `find_largest_white_rectangle` function failed to correctly identify the target rectangle in all training examples, leading to output grids of incorrect dimensions and missing content. The function appears to be finding *some* rectangle of white pixels, but not the specific one that contains the relevant non-white pixels for the output.\n\nThe strategy must be revised to correctly identify the specific white rectangle relevant to the transformation. Observation suggests there is only one such prominent white rectangle in each input that frames the non-white pixels seen in the output. The identification logic needs to reliably find *this* rectangle, not just any large white rectangle.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's analyze the expected output dimensions and compare them with the rectangle found by the previous `find_largest_white_rectangle` function. We also need to determine the coordinates and dimensions of the *actual* white rectangle corresponding to the output.\n\n"
