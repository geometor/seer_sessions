Determine its top-left corner coordinates, height, and width. Create a new output grid with the same height and width as the identified white rectangle, initialized to white (0). Iterate through each pixel within the bounds of the white rectangle in the input grid. For each pixel examined, if its color is not white (0), copy its color to the corresponding relative position in the output grid. The relative position is calculated by subtracting the top-left corner coordinates of the white rectangle from the pixel's absolute coordinates in the input grid. The final output grid contains the non-white content of the input's white rectangle, preserving relative positions, on a white background.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_largest_white_rectangle(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest rectangular area composed entirely of white (0) pixels.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col) coordinates of the largest \n               white rectangle, or None if no white pixel is found.
