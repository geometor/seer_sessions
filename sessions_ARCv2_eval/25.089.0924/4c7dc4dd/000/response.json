White (0) and Gray (5) likely don't count as primary block colors.\n    *   **Framed Objects:** Objects consisting of a colored border (e.g., yellow=4 or azure=8), a white (0) interior, and sometimes a smaller, single-colored shape entirely within that white interior (e.g., magenta=6, yellow=4, red=2).\n3.  **Relationships:** The crucial relationship seems to be containment \u2013 whether a \"Framed Object\" is located entirely inside a \"Solid Block\".\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are small (5x5 or 4x4) and seem to be constructed based on colors derived from a selected \"Framed Object\" and its potential container \"Solid Block\". The pattern of the output grid depends on whether the selected Framed Object was contained within a Solid Block.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Record the `inner_color` for each candidate.\n2.  **Identify Largest Solid Container:** Find the largest solid rectangular block of a single color (excluding white=0 and gray=5) in the input grid.

If no such block exists or is unambiguous, consider the container as absent.\n3.  **Select the Target Framed Object:**\n    *   Check if any identified candidate framed objects lie completely within the boundaries of the largest solid container.\n    *   If one or more candidates are contained, select the top-leftmost one as the \"target object\". Mark this case as `contained`.\n    *   If *no* candidates are contained within the largest solid block, select the candidate object that has the numerically smallest `inner_color`. If there's a tie in `inner_color`, choose the top-leftmost one among them. Mark this case as `not_contained`.\n4.  **Determine Output Colors:**\n    *   Get the `inner_color` from the target object.\n    *   The `interior_color` is always white (0).\n    *   If the case is `contained`, the `primary_color` is the `container_color` identified in step 2.\n    *   If the case is `not_contained`, the `primary_color` is the same as the `inner_color` of the target object.\n5.  **Construct Output Grid:**\n    *   If the case is `contained`: Create a 5x5 grid following this pattern:\n        "
