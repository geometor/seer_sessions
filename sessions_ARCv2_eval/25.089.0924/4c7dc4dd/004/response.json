            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code failed on both training examples, indicating fundamental issues with the implemented logic, likely stemming from incorrect interpretations of the \"container\" object and the selection criteria for the \"target framed object\".\n\n*   **Example 1 Failure:** The code produced `[[0]]`, suggesting it failed to identify any valid framed object according to its strict rules or encountered an error. The expected output is a 5x5 grid, implying a \"contained\" scenario. The likely container is the large solid red (2) rectangle, and the target framed object is the yellow (4) framed one with a magenta (6) inner cross. The code's failure could be due to:\n    *   The `is_framed_object_strict` function being too restrictive.\n    *   Using `find_largest_object_by_pixels` instead of `find_largest_solid_block` identified the wrong container (e.g., the large blue L-shape).\n    *   The `frame_color != container_color` check incorrectly excluded the target object.\n*   **Example 2 Failure:** The code produced a 5x5 (\"contained\") output when a 4x4 (\"not_contained\") output was expected. It used yellow (4) as the primary color, whereas the expected output uses red (2). This implies:\n    *   The container identification was incorrect (likely selecting a yellow object).\n    *   The containment check wrongly classified an object as contained.\n    *   The selection logic failed to pick the object with the minimum inner color (red=2) when no valid containment occurred.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Revert Container Definition:** Go back to defining the container as the largest *solid rectangular block* (ignoring white/gray), using a function like `find_largest_solid_block`. This aligns better with the visual structure in Example 1.\n2.  **Simplify Containment Selection:** Remove the constraint that the `frame_color` must differ from the `container_color` during selection. Select the top-leftmost framed object fully contained within the largest solid block.\n3.  **Verify Framed Object Identification:** Double-check the `is_framed_object_strict` logic to ensure it correctly identifies the relevant structures in both examples.\n4.  **Verify Non-Contained Selection:** Confirm that if no object meets the (revised) containment criteria, the code correctly selects the framed object with the minimum `inner_color`, using top-left as a tie-breaker.\n5.  **Gather Metrics:** Use code execution with the revised logic assumptions to confirm the properties of containers and framed objects in each example.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
