            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial code failed on both examples, indicating flaws in the core logic, specifically around identifying the \"container\" object and the subsequent selection criteria for the \"target\" framed object.\n\n*   **Example 1 Failure:** The code produced a minimal `[[0], [0], [0]]` output instead of the expected 5x5 grid. The analysis suggests the `find_largest_solid_block` function, which looks for a *pure* rectangle, identified a container that did *not* geometrically contain the visually correct target framed object (Yellow/Magenta). This led to the wrong framed object (Yellow/Red) being selected as contained, resulting in the wrong `inner_color` (2 instead of 6) being used for the 5x5 pattern. The fix requires redefining the \"container\" as the largest *object* (allowing holes/irregular shapes) rather than the largest solid rectangle and ensuring the correct framed object is identified as contained within the container object's bounding box.\n*   **Example 2 Failure:** The code produced a 4x4 grid (correctly identifying the \"not contained\" case) but used the wrong `primary_color` (Yellow=4 instead of Red=2). The analysis revealed a potential rule refinement: a framed object is only considered \"contained\" if its frame color *differs* from the container object's color. When the container (Azure=8) had the same color as the frames (Azure=8), the containment rule was bypassed, correctly triggering the fallback selection (smallest `inner_color` among *all* candidates), which led to the correct `inner_color` (Red=2) and the 4x4 output.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Replace `find_largest_solid_block` with a function `find_largest_object_by_pixels` that uses `find_objects` to find all objects (ignoring colors 0 and 5), calculates their pixel counts, and returns the object with the maximum pixel count (breaking ties using the top-left bounding box coordinates).\n2.  Update the target object selection logic to incorporate the frame color vs. container color check for the containment path.\n3.  Verify the `is_framed_object` function correctly identifies the structure (frame, white interior, single inner non-white object).\n\n**Metrics**\n"
