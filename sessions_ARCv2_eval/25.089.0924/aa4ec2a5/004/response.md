**General Assessment:**

The previous code attempt correctly identified the core concept of coloring background pixels based on adjacency to blue pixels but failed in several key areas:
1.  **Incorrect Azure (8) Placement:** The logic for placing azure pixels (diagonal adjacency without orthogonal adjacency) was either flawed or incomplete, leading to many mismatches where pixels should have been azure but were colored red or remained yellow.
2.  **Missing Blue (1) to Azure (8) Transformation:** The crucial rule where original blue pixels turn azure if adjacent to a newly created azure background pixel was entirely missed.
3.  **Potential Magenta (6) Errors:** While less frequent, there might be subtle errors in the conditions for magenta placement (requiring >= 2 orthogonal blue neighbors).

The strategy to resolve these errors involves:
1.  Precisely re-evaluating the conditions for assigning red (2), azure (8), and magenta (6) to the initially yellow (4) background pixels, paying close attention to the precedence and the exact neighbor configurations required.
2.  Introducing a second stage to the transformation process specifically to handle the change of original blue (1) pixels to azure (8) based on the results of the first stage (background coloring).
3.  Using code execution to analyze the exact pixel mismatches in the failed examples to confirm the revised hypotheses.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's analyze the differences between the `transformed_output` from the previous code run and the `expected_output` for each example.
