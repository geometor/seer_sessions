Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The input grids consist primarily of a yellow (4) background with several distinct shapes made of blue (1) pixels. These blue shapes vary in form (rectangles, L-shapes, U-shapes, single pixels) and position across the examples.

The output grids retain the original blue shapes in their exact locations. The transformation involves adding new colored pixels around these blue shapes, effectively creating borders or zones based on proximity and configuration:

1.  **Red Border:** Pixels immediately orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the blue shapes are changed from yellow to red (2).
2.  **Azure Corners:** Pixels diagonally adjacent to the blue shapes are changed from yellow to azure (8), but only if they are not already orthogonally adjacent to *any* blue pixel (i.e., not already turned red).
3.  **Magenta Concavities:** Some yellow pixels located in concave areas or "inside" corners of the blue shapes (specifically, those orthogonally adjacent to two or more blue pixels of the *same* original shape) are changed to magenta (6). This magenta color takes precedence over the red color if a pixel meets both conditions.

The rest of the background remains yellow (4). The transformation seems to identify the blue objects and then apply coloring rules based on different types of adjacency to these objects.

**Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: background
    color: yellow (4)
  - type: object
    color: blue (1)
    description: Contiguous shapes of blue pixels. Variable forms and locations.
  - type: generated_border
    color: red (2)
    description: Marks pixels orthogonally adjacent to blue objects.
  - type: generated_corner
    color: azure (8)
    description: Marks pixels diagonally adjacent to blue objects, excluding those already marked red.
  - type: generated_concavity
    color: magenta (6)
    description: Marks pixels orthogonally adjacent to two or more blue pixels from the same object. Overwrites red if applicable.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    primary: blue object pixels
    secondary: yellow background pixels
    rules:
      - condition: orthogonal adjacency to one or more blue pixels
        action: change secondary pixel to red (2)
      - condition: diagonal adjacency to one or more blue pixels AND NOT orthogonal adjacency to any blue pixel
        action: change secondary pixel to azure (8)
      - condition: orthogonal adjacency to two or more blue pixels (from the same object instance)
        action: change secondary pixel to magenta (6) # This rule takes precedence over the red rule.

grid_properties:
  - size: variable (input and output have the same dimensions for each example)
  - colors_used_input: [yellow (4), blue (1)]
  - colors_used_output: [yellow (4), blue (1), red (2), azure (8), magenta (6)]

transformation:
  - preserves: original blue (1) objects' positions and color.
  - modifies: yellow (4) background pixels based on their proximity and relationship to the blue (1) objects.
  - adds: red (2), azure (8), and magenta (6) pixels according to specific adjacency rules.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous blue (1) objects in the input grid.
3.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.
4.  If the pixel `input[r, c]` is yellow (4):
    a.  Check its 8 neighbors (orthogonal and diagonal) in the input grid.
    b.  Count the number of **orthogonal** neighbors that are blue (1). Let this be `ortho_blue_count`.
    c.  Count the number of **diagonal** neighbors that are blue (1). Let this be `diag_blue_count`.
    d.  If `ortho_blue_count` is 2 or more, change the pixel `output[r, c]` to magenta (6).
    e.  Else if `ortho_blue_count` is 1, change the pixel `output[r, c]` to red (2).
    f.  Else if `diag_blue_count` is 1 or more (and `ortho_blue_count` is 0), change the pixel `output[r, c]` to azure (8).
5.  Pixels that were originally blue (1) in the input remain blue (1) in the output.
6.  Yellow (4) pixels that do not meet any of the conditions in step 4 remain yellow (4) in the output.
