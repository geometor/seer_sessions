elements:
  - type: background
    color: yellow (4)
  - type: object
    color: blue (1)
    description: Contiguous shapes of blue pixels. Variable forms and locations.
  - type: generated_border
    color: red (2)
    description: Marks pixels orthogonally adjacent to blue objects.
  - type: generated_corner
    color: azure (8)
    description: Marks pixels diagonally adjacent to blue objects, excluding those already marked red.
  - type: generated_concavity
    color: magenta (6)
    description: Marks pixels orthogonally adjacent to two or more blue pixels from the same object. Overwrites red if applicable.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    primary: blue object pixels
    secondary: yellow background pixels
    rules:
      - condition: orthogonal adjacency to one or more blue pixels
        action: change secondary pixel to red (2)
      - condition: diagonal adjacency to one or more blue pixels AND NOT orthogonal adjacency to any blue pixel
        action: change secondary pixel to azure (8)
      - condition: orthogonal adjacency to two or more blue pixels (from the same object instance)
        action: change secondary pixel to magenta (6) # This rule takes precedence over the red rule.

grid_properties:
  - size: variable (input and output have the same dimensions for each example)
  - colors_used_input: [yellow (4), blue (1)]
  - colors_used_output: [yellow (4), blue (1), red (2), azure (8), magenta (6)]

transformation:
  - preserves: original blue (1) objects' positions and color.
  - modifies: yellow (4) background pixels based on their proximity and relationship to the blue (1) objects.
  - adds: red (2), azure (8), and magenta (6) pixels according to specific adjacency rules.
