These blue shapes vary in form (rectangles, L-shapes, U-shapes, single pixels) and position across the examples.\n\nThe output grids retain the original blue shapes in their exact locations. The transformation involves adding new colored pixels around these blue shapes, effectively creating borders or zones based on proximity and configuration:\n\n1.  **Red Border:** Pixels immediately orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the blue shapes are changed from yellow to red (2).\n2.  **Azure Corners:** Pixels diagonally adjacent to the blue shapes are changed from yellow to azure (8), but only if they are not already orthogonally adjacent to *any* blue pixel (i.e., not already turned red).\n3.  **Magenta Concavities:** Some yellow pixels located in concave areas or \"inside\" corners of the blue shapes (specifically, those orthogonally adjacent to two or more blue pixels of the *same* original shape) are changed to magenta (6). This magenta color takes precedence over the red color if a pixel meets both conditions.\n\nThe rest of the background remains yellow (4). The transformation seems to identify the blue objects and then apply coloring rules based on different types of adjacency to these objects.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
