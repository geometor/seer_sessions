*   **Assessment:** The initial hypothesis, focusing on the single largest contiguous object of the non-background color, was incorrect. The results show that the transformed outputs consistently included larger areas than expected, often encompassing multiple disconnected groups of non-background pixels or incorrectly identifying the primary object. The correct approach appears to involve identifying *all* pixels that are *not* the background color and finding the minimal bounding box that contains *all* of them, regardless of contiguity or size. The background color is correctly identified as the most frequent color.

*   **Metrics Gathering:**

    Let's analyze Example 1 to confirm the hypothesis.
    Input grid dimensions: 20 rows, 25 columns.
    Colors: Green (3) and Yellow (4).
    Expected Output dimensions: 11 rows, 12 columns.
    Previous Transformed Output dimensions: 20 rows, 16 columns.

Example 1 Metrics:

Expected output dimensions: (11, 12)
Color counts: {np.int64(3): np.int64(385), np.int64(4): np.int64(115)}
Background color: 3
Non-background pixel coordinates found: True
Bounding box of non-background pixels: rows 0-19, cols 0-20
Bounding box dimensions (calculated): 20 rows, 21 columns
Calculated bounding box dimensions DO NOT MATCH expected output dimensions.

Extracted subgrid based on all non-background pixels:

Extracted subgrid DOES NOT MATCH expected output.

```
The simple bounding box of *all* non-background pixels is also incorrect. The calculated bounding box (20x21) is much larger than the expected output (11x12).

Re-evaluating Example 1:
- Background: Green (3)
- Object: Yellow (4)
- Expected Output: An 11x12 grid.
- The yellow pixels in the input form several disconnected shapes.
- The output seems to focus on a specific region of interest, but it's not just the bounding box of *all* yellow pixels.
- Let's reconsider the "largest object" idea but refine it. What if the task is to find the bounding box of the non-background object that has the largest *area* (number of pixels)?

Let's recalculate for Example 1 using the "largest connected component" logic from the previous code attempt.

```
The "largest object bounding box" approach (tested with 4-connectivity, 8-connectivity gives similar size mismatch) also fails for Example 1. The bounding box (20x16) is still incorrect compared to the expected (11x12).

Let's reconsider the examples:
- In all cases, the output is a rectangular subgrid of the input.
- The subgrid contains *some* of the non-background pixels, and potentially some background pixels as well if they fall within the bounding box.
- The key must be *how* the bounding box is determined.

Maybe it's not the largest object by pixel count, but the one with the largest *bounding box area*? Or maybe the one whose bounding box is closest to being square?

Let's calculate the bounding boxes for *all* objects in Example 1.

Example 1 - Bounding Box Analysis (4-connectivity):
Expected output dimensions: (11, 12)

Object Label: 1
  Slice: rows 0-19, cols 0-15
  Dimensions: 20 x 16
  Pixel Count: 68

Object Label: 2
  Slice: rows 5-12, cols 2-10
  Dimensions: 8 x 9
  Pixel Count: 29

Object Label: 3
  Slice: rows 6-8, cols 18-20
  Dimensions: 3 x 3
  Pixel Count: 7

Object Label: 4
  Slice: rows 8-9, cols 5-7
  Dimensions: 2 x 3
  Pixel Count: 5

Object Label: 5
  Slice: rows 15-16, cols 5-7
  Dimensions: 2 x 3
  Pixel Count: 6

```
Still no match. None of the individual object bounding boxes have the dimensions 11x12.

Let's look closely at Example 1 again:
Input: 20x25 grid, Green (3) background, Yellow (4) objects.
Output: 11x12 grid.
Bounding box of *all* yellow: rows 0-19, cols 0-20 (size 20x21).
Bounding box of largest yellow object (label 1, 68 pixels): rows 0-19, cols 0-15 (size 20x16).

Where does the 11x12 come from?
Rows: The yellow pixels span rows 0 to 19. The output spans rows corresponding to input rows 5 to 15. (15 - 5 + 1 = 11 rows).
Cols: The yellow pixels span cols 0 to 20. The output spans cols corresponding to input cols 3 to 14. (14 - 3 + 1 = 12 cols).

Let's check if rows 5-15, cols 3-14 contain *all* the yellow pixels.
