            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided training example (`train_1`) for the task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grid contains distinct regions. There's an upper section with scattered shapes (blue, yellow, green, red) on an azure background, and a lower section dominated by a large rectangular frame made of gray pixels. Inside this frame, the background is azure, and there are several 'T'-shaped objects composed of green or blue pixels, arranged in rows.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is smaller than the input grid. It consists solely of a gray frame identical in shape and size to the *inner* dimensions of the input frame's content area plus the frame itself. Inside the output frame, the background is azure, and there are specific 3x3 patterns of red or yellow pixels placed at positions corresponding to where the 'T' shapes were in the input frame.\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation appears to isolate the content within the gray frame of the input, discard everything outside it, and then map specific input objects within the frame to fixed output patterns while preserving the frame and the internal background color.\n4.  **Object Mapping:** The 3x3 areas containing green 'T' shapes in the input map to a specific 3x3 red pattern in the output. The 3x3 areas containing blue 'T' shapes in the input map to a specific 3x3 yellow pattern in the output. The relative positions of these patterns are maintained within the frame. The exact shape of the input 'T' (upright, rotated) does not seem to affect the resulting output pattern, only the color (green or blue) matters.\n5.  **Color Mapping:** Input Green (3) -> Output Red (2) pattern. Input Blue (1) -> Output Yellow (4) pattern. The patterns themselves also use the background color (azure=8).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify the background color within this region (in the example, this is azure=8).\n5.  **Initialize Output Content:** Fill the region inside the frame in the output grid with the background color identified in step 4.\n6.  **Define Mappings:** Establish the rules for transforming input elements to output patterns based on the examples. For this task (based on `train_1`):\n    *   The element size is 3x3.\n    *   Input color Green (3) maps to the Red (2) pattern: `[[2, 8, 2], [2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2]]`.\n    *   Input color Blue (1) maps to the Yellow (4) pattern: `[[4, 8, 4], [4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4]]`.\n7.  **Scan and Replace:** Iterate through the content area (inside the frame) of the input grid, examining potential 3x3 blocks.\n8.  For each 3x3 block in the input content area starting at `(row, col)`:\n    *   Check if the block contains any green (3) pixels. If yes, overwrite the corresponding 3x3 area in the output grid (starting at the same relative `(row, col)` within the frame) with the Red (2) pattern defined in step 6.\n    *   Else, check if the block contains any blue (1) pixels. If yes, overwrite the corresponding 3x3 area in the output grid with the Yellow (4) pattern defined in step 6.\n9.  **Finalize:** The resulting grid after all replacements are done is the final output."
