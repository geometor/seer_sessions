Identify all pixels with propagating colors (azure-8, red-2, yellow-4) in the input grid.\n2. For each identified source pixel:\n   - Trace four diagonal lines (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right) starting from the source pixel's location.\n   - Along each diagonal line, if a pixel location in the original input grid contains a blue (1) pixel, change the color of that pixel in the output grid to the color of the source pixel that initiated the trace.\n3. Pixels with other colors (white-0, green-3) and the original source pixels themselves remain unchanged, except for blue pixels modified by propagation.\n4. Propagation stops at the grid boundaries.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the diagonal color propagation transformation to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): A 2D list representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: A 2D list representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to a numpy array for easier manipulation\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    # Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid\n    output_np = np.copy(input_np)\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n\n    # Define the colors that propagate\n    propagating_colors = {2, 4, 8} # red, yellow, azure\n    # Define the color that gets overwritten\n    target_color = 1 # blue\n\n    # Find all source pixels with propagating colors\n    source_pixels = []\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            if input_np[r, c] in propagating_colors:\n                source_pixels.append(((r, c), input_np[r, c]))\n\n    # Define the four diagonal directions (delta_row, delta_col)\n    directions = [\n        (-1, -1), # up-left\n        (-1, 1),  # up-right\n        (1, -1),  # down-left\n        (1, 1)   # down-right\n    ]\n\n    # Process each source pixel\n    for (r_src, c_src), prop_color in source_pixels:\n        # Propagate in each of the four diagonal directions\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            # Start tracing from the position next to the source pixel\n            for step in range(1, max(height, width)): # Max possible steps\n                nr, nc = r_src + dr * step, c_src + dc * step\n\n                # Check if the new position is within grid boundaries\n                if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                    # Check if the pixel at the new position in the *original* input grid is the target color (blue)\n                    if input_np[nr, nc] == target_color:\n                        # Update the corresponding pixel in the output grid with the propagating color\n                        output_np[nr, nc] = prop_color\n                    # Note: Propagation continues even if it hits a non-target color,\n                    # but only overwrites target colors.
