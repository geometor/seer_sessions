            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous attempt failed because the logic for identifying \"source pixels\" and determining the output line generation was incorrect. The concept of identifying a single large \"distractor\" object and using all *other* non-blue pixels as sources was flawed. The examples show that the source pixels are typically small, isolated, non-blue, non-background objects (often single pixels), and there are exactly two such source objects. The relationship between the positions of these two source objects (whether they are vertically or horizontally aligned) dictates how the output line(s) are generated.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Identify *all* non-background objects.\n2.  **Identify Blue Objects:** Separate the two blue objects.\n3.  **Identify Lower Blue Object:** Determine the lower blue object as before (max row, then min row tie-break). Its top row determines the line height.\n4.  **Identify Source Objects:** Find the two non-blue objects with the smallest pixel count (often size 1). These are the source objects.\n5.  **Analyze Source Object Alignment:** Check if the source objects are primarily aligned vertically (share a column) or horizontally (share a row). Using a representative point for each object (e.g., the top-left pixel) might be necessary if objects span multiple cells. For single-pixel sources, this is simpler.\n6.  **Implement Conditional Line Generation:**\n    *   If vertically aligned: Generate a single alternating line in the shared column. Determine the starting color based on the source object with the higher row index.\n    *   If horizontally aligned: Generate solid lines in the columns of each source object, using the color of that object.\n7.  **Preserve Other Objects:** Ensure the upper blue object and any other larger non-blue objects (like the red/green lines) are preserved.\n8.  **Remove Source Pixels:** Remove only the pixels belonging to the two identified source objects.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the objects in the training examples to confirm the source pixel identification strategy.\n\n"

However, the *actual* source pixels are the single yellow (4) at (11, 10) and red (2) at (12, 10). These are vertically aligned. The expected output shows an alternating red/yellow line in column 10.\n*   **Example 2:** The smallest non-blue objects are the single yellow (4) at (11, 8) and red (2) at (11, 9). These are horizontally aligned. The expected output shows solid yellow and red lines in columns 8 and 9 respectively.\n\n**Corrected Strategy:**\n\nThe key isn't just size, but context. The source pixels/objects seem to be the *isolated* non-blue, non-background elements that are *not* part of the larger, structured non-blue patterns (like the vertical red/green stripes or the horizontal red/green sequence in Example 1).\n\n1.  **Identify All Objects:** Find all non-background objects.\n2.  **Separate Blue Objects:** Isolate the two blue (1) objects.\n3.  **Identify Lower Blue Object:** Determine the lower one (max row, then min row). Its top row (`min_row_lower`) defines the line height.\n4.  **Identify Potential Source Objects:** Collect all non-blue objects.\n5.  **Filter Out Large/Structured Objects:** Remove any large non-blue objects. A heuristic might be needed here. Perhaps objects touching the grid edge, or objects larger than a small threshold (e.g., > 2 pixels), or objects forming clear lines/patterns could be excluded. *Crucially, the examples show the sources are single pixels.* Let's refine the source identification to: **Find all single-pixel non-blue objects.** Assume there will be exactly two.\n6.  **Identify Source Pixels:** The two single-pixel non-blue objects are the sources. Record their colors and coordinates.\n7.  **Analyze Source Alignment:** Check if the two source pixels share a column or a row.\n8.  **Generate Lines:**\n    *   **Vertical Alignment (Same Column):** Target column is the shared column. Line height is `min_row_lower`. `color1` is the color of the source pixel with the *higher* row index, `color2` is the other. Alternate `color1`, `color2` starting from row 0.\n    *   **Horizontal Alignment (Same Row):** Target columns are the columns of the two source pixels. Line height is `min_row_lower`. For each target column, draw a solid line using the color of the source pixel in that column.\n9.  **Update Output Grid:** Copy input to output, remove the two source pixels, draw the generated line(s).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
