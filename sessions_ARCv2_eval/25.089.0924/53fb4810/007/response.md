Transformation Rule:

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find all distinct connected objects of non-background (azure 8) colors in the input grid, recording their color, pixels, size, and bounding box information.
3.  Identify the two blue (1) objects.
4.  Determine the "lower" blue object based on maximum row index, with minimum row index as a tie-breaker (higher index wins).
5.  Determine the line height (`height_line`) as the minimum row index of the lower blue object.
6.  Identify the two "source pixels" by finding exactly two objects that are non-blue and have a size of 1 pixel.
7.  Remove the source pixels from the output grid (set to background color 8).
8.  Analyze the alignment of the two source pixels: vertical (same column) or horizontal (same row).
9.  Generate vertical line(s) in the output grid based on alignment:
    a.  If Vertically Aligned: Generate a single vertical line in the shared column, from row 0 up to `height_line`. The line alternates colors, starting with the color of the source pixel having the *higher* row index.
    b.  If Horizontally Aligned: Generate two solid vertical lines, one in the column of each source pixel, from row 0 up to `height_line`. Each line uses the color of the corresponding source pixel.
10. Return the modified output grid.
