**General Assessment:**

The initial code failed on all training examples, indicating that the deduced transformation rules were incomplete or incorrect. The discrepancies are significant, particularly for the Azure-related conditions (Examples 1, 2, 3) and the vertical line condition (Example 4).

*   **Example 1 (MFC Blue):** The error was minor, suggesting the core idea (largest blue object transforms to red) is likely correct, but the object identification (adjacency) or implementation details were slightly off. The expected output uses 8-way adjacency for the blue object.
*   **Example 2 (MFC Magenta):** The transformation is complex. Simple color swaps and the initial row duplication logic were insufficient. The output shows paired color swaps (Magenta<->Orange, Red<->Yellow), removal of Azure, *and* a pattern involving rows 1/2 and 14/15 that depends on the input row 1 (Magenta alternating with White) and row 14 (Orange/Magenta pattern). The specific logic for transforming the bulk of the grid (rows 3-13) needs reassessment; it appears Red/Yellow locations transform, but Magenta/Orange locations become white. The row duplication effect needs to be precise.
*   **Example 3 (MFC Yellow):** The transformation is not a simple pixel replacement. Yellow pixels seem to map to Red patterns, and Blue pixels map to Orange patterns in the output, while Azure and other colors are removed. The patterns are not direct overlays but might involve replication or positioning based on the original locations.
*   **Example 4 (Vertical Red Line):** The rule implementation was incorrect. The area *right* of the line should become white, not retain its original colors.

**Strategy:**

1.  Correct the `find_objects` function to use 8-way adjacency for Example 1.
2.  Re-analyze Example 2 meticulously, focusing on the exact color swaps, removals, and the specific pattern generation for the top/bottom rows and the middle section.
3.  Re-analyze Example 3, looking for pattern generation rules linked to the input positions of Yellow and Blue pixels.
4.  Correct the vertical Red line rule implementation (Example 4) to clear the area to the right.
5.  Refine the conditional logic and the hierarchy of rules.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's re-examine the examples with specific checks.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Colors (non-white): Blue(1): 5, Red(2): 1, Azure(8): 3
    *   MFC (non-white, non-azure): Blue(1)
    *   Largest Blue object (using 8-way adjacency): 5 pixels at `(0,0), (1,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,4)`
    *   Expected Output: A white grid with Red(2) at the coordinates of the largest Blue object from the input.
    *   *Previous Error Cause:* Likely used 4-way adjacency, splitting the object.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Colors (non-white): Blue(1): 0, Red(2): 5, Yellow(4): 5, Magenta(6): 10, Orange(7): 5, Azure(8): 11
    *   MFC (non-white, non-azure): Magenta(6)
    *   Expected Output Transformation:
        *   Magenta(6) <-> Orange(7) swap occurs *only* in the specific row-copying logic for rows 1/2 and 14/15 based on input rows 1 and 14.
        *   Red(2) -> Yellow(4) transformation occurs where original Red pixels were.
        *   Yellow(4) -> Red(2) transformation occurs where original Yellow pixels were.
        *   Azure(8) pixels become white(0).
        *   Original Magenta(6) and Orange(7) pixels *not* involved in the row-copying become white(0).
        *   Row Copying Detail: If input(r, c) is Magenta(6) and input(r+1, c) is white(0), output(r+1, c) becomes Orange(7). If input(r, c) is Orange(7) and input(r+1, c) is white(0), output(r+1, c) becomes Magenta(6). This seems to apply grid-wide, affecting the top/bottom pattern generation.
    *   *Previous Error Cause:* Incorrectly applied swaps globally and didn't handle removals/specific patterns correctly. The row duplication logic was also misapplied or incomplete.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Colors (non-white): Blue(1): 5, Red(2): 1, Yellow(4): 10, Orange(7): 1, Azure(8): 18
    *   MFC (non-white, non-azure): Yellow(4)
    *   Expected Output Transformation:
        *   Yellow(4) input pixels seem to generate 2x2 Red(2) blocks in the output, potentially centered or anchored relative to the input Yellow pixel.
        *   Blue(1) input pixels seem to generate specific Orange(7) shapes/patterns ("L" shapes or pairs) in the output, near the original Blue pixel locations.
        *   All other non-white colors (Red, Orange, Azure) are removed (become white(0)).
    *   *Previous Error Cause:* Assumed simple 1-to-1 color replacement instead of pattern generation based on input locations.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: Vertical Red(2) line at column 5.
    *   Expected Output Transformation:
        *   Pixels left of column 5 (cols 0-4) become Red(2).
        *   Pixels at column 5 become Blue(1).
        *   Pixels right of column 5 (cols 6-7) become white(0).
    *   *Previous Error Cause:* Incorrectly handled the area to the right of the line.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid. The initialization method depends on the rule applied (sometimes starting fresh, sometimes copying).
2.  **Check for Vertical Red Line:** Examine the input grid. Is there a column `c` where every pixel from `row 0` to `row height-1` is Red (2)?
    *   If YES:
        a.  Create the output grid, initially all white (0), with the same dimensions as the input.
        b.  Fill the region in the output grid where `column < c` with Red (2).
        c.  Fill the region in the output grid where `column == c` with Blue (1).
        d.  Leave the region where `column > c` as white (0).
        e.  The transformation is complete. Stop.
3.  **Check for Azure:** If no vertical Red line was found, check if Azure (8) exists anywhere in the input grid.
    *   If NO Azure (8): Return a copy of the input grid. Stop.
    *   If YES Azure (8):
        a.  Count the frequency of all colors in the input grid, excluding white (0) and Azure (8).
        b.  If no such colors exist (only white and/or Azure are present): Create the output grid by copying the input grid and changing all Azure (8) pixels to white (0). Stop.
        c.  Identify the color with the highest frequency (Most Frequent Color - MFC). If there's a tie in frequency, choose the color with the lower numerical value.
        d.  **Execute rule based on MFC:**
            i.  **If MFC is Blue (1):**
                1.  Find all distinct contiguous objects of Blue (1) pixels in the input grid using 8-way adjacency (including diagonals).
                2.  Identify the object with the largest number of pixels.
                3.  Create a new output grid filled entirely with white (0).
                4.  For each pixel coordinate `(r, c)` belonging to the largest Blue object, set the output grid pixel `(r, c)` to Red (2).
                5.  Stop.
            ii. **If MFC is Magenta (6):**
                1.  Create an intermediate grid, initially filled with white (0).
                2.  Iterate through the input grid. If input `(r, c)` is Red(2), set intermediate `(r, c)` to Yellow(4). If input `(r, c)` is Yellow(4), set intermediate `(r, c)` to Red(2). (Azure, Magenta, Orange, and others result in white).
                3.  Initialize the final output grid as a copy of the intermediate grid.
                4.  Iterate through the *original input grid* from `r = 0` to `height - 2`. For each `(r, c)`:
                    *   If input `(r, c)` is Magenta(6) AND input `(r+1, c)` is white(0), set *final output* `(r+1, c)` to Orange(7).
                    *   If input `(r, c)` is Orange(7) AND input `(r+1, c)` is white(0), set *final output* `(r+1, c)` to Magenta(6).
                5.  Stop.
            iii. **If MFC is Yellow (4):**
                1.  Initialize the output grid filled entirely with white (0).
                2.  Iterate through the input grid `(r, c)`:
                    *   If input `(r, c)` is Yellow(4): Set the 2x2 block in the output grid at `(r, c)`, `(r+1, c)`, `(r, c+1)`, `(r+1, c+1)` to Red(2) (ensure coordinates are within bounds).
                    *   If input `(r, c)` is Blue(1): Set the output grid pixels `(r, c)` and `(r+1, c+1)` to Orange(7) (ensure coordinates are within bounds). *Correction*: Reviewing Example 3 output suggests Blue(1) at (r,c) might map to Orange(7) at (r+num_rows/2, c) and (r+num_rows/2+1, c+1) or similar pattern - need precise pattern logic. Let's stick to the simpler observed pattern for now: output(r,c)=7, output(r+1,c+1)=7. *(Self-correction: The pattern is more complex, maybe related to quadrants or relative positions. Example 3 Blue(1) at (13,2) -> Orange(7) at (13,0) & (14,1); Blue(1) at (13,14) -> Orange(7) at (13,14) & (14,15) - looks like (r, c-2)? & (r+1, c-1)? Let's try generating an L-shape: output(r, c)=7, output(r+1, c)=7, output(r+1, c+1)=7)*. **Revised Hypothesis for Blue -> Orange:** If input(r,c) is Blue(1), set output(r,c), output(r+1,c), output(r+1,c-1) to Orange(7), checking bounds. **Final Attempt for Blue -> Orange:** Looks like Blue at (r,c) generates Orange at (r,c) and (r+1, c+1). Let's use that.
                3.  (Azure, Red, Orange, Magenta etc. from input result in white).
                4.  Stop.
            iv. **If MFC is any other color:** Create the output grid by copying the input grid and changing all Azure (8) pixels to white (0). Stop.
