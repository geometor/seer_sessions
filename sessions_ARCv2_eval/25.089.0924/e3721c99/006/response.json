            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial code implementation failed because it incorrectly assumed the transformation involved matching entire contiguous gray objects to reference shapes. The results show that almost all gray pixels were erased, indicating that none of the complete gray shapes matched the reference shapes' forms.\n\nThe correct interpretation, based on visual inspection of the input/output pairs, is a **template matching** process. The non-gray, non-white shapes act as templates. The transformation involves searching the grid for occurrences of these templates where the template's pattern aligns perfectly with gray pixels in the input. If a match is found, those gray pixels are recolored with the template's color in the output. Gray pixels that are not part of any successful template match are erased (turned white).\n\n**Strategy for Resolution**\n\n1.  **Refine Reference Shape Identification:** Extract all non-white, non-gray contiguous shapes. Store their color and relative pixel pattern (form). Add filtering to exclude shapes that are likely not templates (e.g., very large shapes like the separator line).\n2.  **Implement Template Matching:** Iterate through potential top-left anchor points in the input grid. For each anchor, try matching each reference template.\n3.  **Matching Logic:** A match occurs at anchor `(r, c)` for template `T` if, for every relative coordinate `(dr, dc)` in `T`'s form, the input grid pixel `input[r+dr, c+dc]` is gray (5). (An optional stricter match could require pixels within the template's bounding box *but not* part of its form to be non-gray).\n4.  **Update Output:** If a match occurs, update the corresponding pixels in the output grid with the template's color. Use a mask to track successfully matched pixels.\n5.  **Cleanup:** After checking all templates and anchors, change any remaining gray pixels (those not successfully matched) in the output grid to white (0).\n\n**Metrics Analysis**\n"
