Okay, let's break down the task presented in the examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are the same size (30x30 in the examples). The input grid generally seems divided into three conceptual parts:
    *   An upper region containing several small, distinct, colored shapes (yellow, green, blue, red) on a white background. These appear to serve as "reference patterns" or "keys".
    *   A single horizontal line made of blue pixels acting as a separator.
    *   A lower region (or sometimes other regions, like the top-right in example 2) containing multiple shapes made of gray pixels, also on a white background. Some non-gray shapes might also exist outside the reference area.
2.  **Reference Shapes:** The colored shapes in the upper region (e.g., yellow '4', green '3', blue '1', red '2' in example 1) have distinct forms and colors.
3.  **Target Shapes:** The gray shapes are the primary targets for transformation. Their forms vary; some seem to visually match the reference shapes, while others do not.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation happens to the gray shapes.
    *   Gray shapes in the input that *match* the form of one of the reference shapes are "recolored" in the output grid using the color of the matching reference shape.
    *   Gray shapes in the input that *do not match* the form of any reference shape are effectively "erased" â€“ replaced by the white background color in the output grid.
5.  **Invariance:** The reference shapes themselves, the blue separator line, and any other non-gray, non-white pixels in the input seem to remain unchanged in the output grid. The transformation specifically targets only the gray pixels that form contiguous shapes.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input:
  Grid: 2D array of integers (colors).
  Background: white (0).
  Reference_Area: Typically the upper part of the grid.
  Separator: A horizontal line of blue (1) pixels often present.
  Target_Color: gray (5).

Objects:
  - Type: Reference_Shape
    Properties:
      - Color: yellow (4), green (3), blue (1), red (2) etc. (non-gray, non-white)
      - Location: Typically in the Reference_Area.
      - Form: A specific pattern/arrangement of pixels.
      - Contiguous: Pixels of the same color form a connected component.
  - Type: Target_Shape
    Properties:
      - Color: gray (5)
      - Location: Anywhere in the grid except potentially overlapping the exact pixels of a reference shape.
      - Form: A specific pattern/arrangement of pixels.
      - Contiguous: Pixels of the same color form a connected component.
  - Type: Separator_Line
    Properties:
      - Color: blue (1)
      - Form: Horizontal line.
  - Type: Background
    Properties:
      - Color: white (0)

Relationships:
  - Form_Matching: A Target_Shape's form can match a Reference_Shape's form. Form comparison ignores color and absolute position, focusing on the relative arrangement of pixels within the shape.

Actions:
  1. Identify_References: Find all Reference_Shapes in the input grid, noting their form and color.
  2. Identify_Targets: Find all Target_Shapes (contiguous gray areas) in the input grid, noting their form and location.
  3. Compare_Forms: For each Target_Shape, compare its form against the forms of all Reference_Shapes.
  4. Recolor_Matched_Targets: If a Target_Shape's form matches a Reference_Shape's form, replace the gray pixels of the Target_Shape with the color of the matching Reference_Shape in the output grid.
  5. Erase_Unmatched_Targets: If a Target_Shape's form does not match any Reference_Shape's form, replace the gray pixels of the Target_Shape with the background color (white, 0) in the output grid.
  6. Preserve_Others: Copy all non-gray pixels from the input grid to the output grid.

Output:
  Grid: A modified version of the input grid where gray shapes are either recolored based on matching reference shapes or erased.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the "reference shapes": Locate all distinct, contiguous, non-white, non-gray shapes in the input grid (typically found in the upper region). For each reference shape, store its unique form (relative pixel pattern) and its color.
3.  Identify all "target shapes": Locate all distinct, contiguous shapes made of gray (5) pixels in the input grid. For each target shape, determine its form (relative pixel pattern) and the coordinates of its pixels.
4.  Iterate through each identified gray target shape:
    a.  Compare the form of the current gray target shape with the forms of all identified reference shapes.
    b.  Check if an exact match in form is found between the target shape and any reference shape.
    c.  If a match is found with a reference shape:
        i.  Retrieve the color of the matching reference shape.
        ii. For every pixel coordinate belonging to the current gray target shape, update the corresponding pixel in the *output grid* to this retrieved color.
    d.  If no match is found with any reference shape:
        i.  For every pixel coordinate belonging to the current gray target shape, update the corresponding pixel in the *output grid* to the background color (white, 0).
5.  Return the modified output grid. (Pixels that were not part of any gray shape remain unchanged from the initial copy).
