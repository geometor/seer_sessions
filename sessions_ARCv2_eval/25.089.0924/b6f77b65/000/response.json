The rest of the grid contains a white background (0) and several distinct geometric shapes composed of various colors. The output grid is the same size as the input. The transformation involves potentially shifting all colored pixels *except* the one at (0,0) based on the color of the pixel at (0,0). If the pixel at (0,0) is maroon (9), no shift occurs, and the output is identical to the input. If the pixel at (0,0) is a different color, all other non-white pixels are shifted down and to the right by a specific amount determined by that color. Pixels shifted beyond the grid boundaries are discarded. The background remains white, and the top-left pixel remains unchanged in the output.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
