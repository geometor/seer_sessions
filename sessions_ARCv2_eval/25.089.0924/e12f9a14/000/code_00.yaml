InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - background_color: azure (8)
    - contains: objects
Objects:
  Types:
    - Frame:
        Properties:
          - color: green (3)
          - shape: rectangular or irregular contour
          - function: encloses other colored pixels
    - Content:
        Properties:
          - color: various (maroon(9), blue(1), yellow(4), red(2), orange(7), magenta(6))
          - location: can be inside a Frame or standalone
          - shape: various (often rectangular blocks or single pixels)
Transformation:
  Action: ProjectColorOutwards
  SourcePixels: all non-azure (8) pixels in the input grid
  TargetPixels: azure (8) pixels in the input grid
  Rule:
    - For each SourcePixel:
        - Project its color horizontally (left and right) onto adjacent TargetPixels.
        - Project its color vertically (up and down) onto adjacent TargetPixels.
        - Continue projection in each direction until a non-TargetPixel (i.e., any color other than azure) or the grid boundary is encountered.
  OutputGrid:
    - Retains all original non-azure pixels from the input grid.
    - Azure pixels that were overwritten by the projection now have the color of the source pixel that projected onto them.
Relationships:
  - Containment: Green Frames contain Content pixels.
  - Adjacency: The projection rule depends on horizontal and vertical adjacency.
  - Stopping Condition: Projection stops at non-azure pixels or grid boundaries.
