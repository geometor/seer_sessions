Transformation Rule Description:

1.  Identify the background color: This is the most frequent color in the input grid, excluding red (color 2).
2.  Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.
3.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.
4.  If the pixel's color `clr` is not red (2) and not the background color, check its cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right).
5.  If a neighbor `(nr, nc)` contains a red pixel (color 2):
    a.  Determine the reflection axis based on the relative position of the red neighbor:
        - If the red neighbor is directly above or below the current pixel (`c == nc`), the reflection is vertical across the row `nr`.
        - If the red neighbor is directly to the left or right of the current pixel (`r == nr`), the reflection is horizontal across the column `nc`.
    b.  Calculate the coordinates `(rr, rc)` of the reflected pixel.
        - Vertical reflection: `rr = nr + (nr - r)`, `rc = c`
        - Horizontal reflection: `rr = r`, `rc = nc + (nc - c)`
    c.  Check if the calculated reflected coordinates `(rr, rc)` are within the grid boundaries.
    d.  If the reflected coordinates are valid *and* the pixel at `output_grid[rr, rc]` currently holds the background color, update that pixel in the output grid with the original pixel's color `clr`.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
