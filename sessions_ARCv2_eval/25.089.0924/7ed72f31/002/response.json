            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanism as reflection across red elements. However, the implementation failed because it determined the reflection axis (horizontal vs. vertical) based *solely* on the relative position of the *single adjacent* red pixel to the colored pixel being reflected.\n\nThe failures in both examples show this is incorrect. The reflection axis depends on the *orientation of the entire red shape* acting as the mirror.\n*   A horizontal red line reflects objects vertically.\n*   A vertical red line reflects objects horizontally.\n*   A single red pixel appears to function like a vertical line, reflecting objects horizontally in the provided examples.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the logic to:\n1.  Identify the shape/orientation of the red element(s) adjacent to a colored pixel.\n2.  Apply reflection based on the red element's orientation (vertical reflection for horizontal red lines, horizontal reflection for vertical red lines or single red pixels).\n3.  Ensure reflections only overwrite the background color.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the discrepancies pixel by pixel.\n\n**Example 1 Discrepancies:**\n\n*   Expected Output has reflections that Transformed Output is missing.\n*   Missing Green (3) reflections: (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7). These should be reflected horizontally across the red pixel at (4, 5).\n*   Missing Grey (5) reflections: (9, 6), (10, 5). These should be reflected horizontally across the red pixel at (11, 6). Note: (10, 6) *was* correctly reflected.\n*   Missing Yellow (4) reflections: (5, 16), (5, 17). These should be reflected horizontally across the vertical red line in column 14. Note: (6, 15), (6, 16), (7,15), (8,15) *were* correctly reflected.\n*   Missing Azure/Maroon (8) reflections: (16, 11), (16, 12), (17, 14), (17, 15). These should be reflected vertically across the horizontal red line in row 15.\n\n**Example 2 Discrepancies:**\n\n*   Expected Output has reflections that Transformed Output is missing.\n*   Missing Yellow (4) reflections: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3). These should be reflected horizontally across the vertical red line in column 4. Note: Some pixels like (3,5) reflecting to (3,3) were missed.\n*   Missing Blue (1) reflections: (3, 15). Should be reflected horizontally across the red pixel at (3, 13). Note: (3,14) and (4,14) *were* correctly reflected.\n*   Missing Green (3) reflections: (12, 8), (13, 9), (13, 11), (14, 10). These should be reflected vertically across the horizontal red line in row 11. Note: (12,9) *was* correctly reflected.\n\n**Code Execution for Precise Metrics:**\n"
