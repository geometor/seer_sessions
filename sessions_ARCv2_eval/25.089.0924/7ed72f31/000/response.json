            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples use 18x18 grids.\n2.  **Background Color:** In example 1, the predominant color is white (1). In example 2, it's azure (8). This seems to be the background color which is mostly unaffected.\n3.  **Key Color:** Red (2) pixels appear to be significant. They exist as single pixels, horizontal lines, or vertical lines.\n4.  **Other Objects:** Various small shapes composed of other colors (blue, green, yellow, gray, azure) exist in the grid.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve reflection. Objects adjacent to red pixels/lines are mirrored across those red elements.\n6.  **Reflection Axis:**\n    *   If the red element is a horizontal line, the reflection is vertical across the row of the line.\n    *   If the red element is a vertical line, the reflection is horizontal across the column of the line.\n    *   If the red element is a single pixel, the reflection appears to be horizontal across the column of the pixel in the provided examples.\n7.  **Persistence:** The original objects and the red \"mirror\" elements remain in the output grid. The reflection creates a *copy* of the adjacent object.\n8.  **Overlap:** The reflected copies are added to the grid. It appears they only overwrite the background color, not other existing colored pixels from the input.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Determine the background color by finding the most frequent color in the input grid that is not red (2).\n3.  Iterate through every pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.\n4.  If the color `clr` of the pixel `input[r, c]` is *not* red (2) and *not* the background color:\n    a. Check all 4 cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) of `(r, c)`.\n    b. For each neighbor `(nr, nc)` that contains a red (2) pixel:\n        i.  Determine the orientation of the red structure at `(nr, nc)`. Check if `input[nr, nc-1]` or `input[nr, nc+1]` is also red. If yes, classify the red structure as \"horizontal\". Otherwise, classify it as \"vertical/point\".\n        ii. If the red structure is classified as \"horizontal\":\n            *   Calculate the reflected position: `reflected_pos = (nr + (nr - r), c)`. This reflects pixel `(r, c)` vertically across the row `nr`.\n        iii. If the red structure is classified as \"vertical/point\":\n            *   Calculate the reflected position: `reflected_pos = (r, nc + (nc - c))`. This reflects pixel `(r, c)` horizontally across the column `nc`.\n        iv. If the calculated `reflected_pos` is within the grid boundaries *and* the current color at `output[reflected_pos]` is the background color, update the output grid by setting `output[reflected_pos] = clr`.\n5.  After checking all pixels `(r, c)` and processing reflections for their adjacent red neighbors, return the modified output grid."
