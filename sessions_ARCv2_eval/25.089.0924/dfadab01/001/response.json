If yes, draw a 4x4 hollow square of yellow (4) at (r, c) on the output grid.\n    *   **Single Green Pixel (3):** If a green pixel is found at (r, c), check if a 4x4 area starting at (r, c) fits within the grid. If yes, draw a 4x4 hollow square of blue (1) at (r, c) on the output grid.\n    *   **2x2 Magenta Square (6):** If a 2x2 solid square of magenta is found with its top-left corner at (r, c), check if it can be shifted up-left (i.e., r > 0 and c > 0). If yes, draw a 2x2 solid square of magenta (6) at (r-1, c-1) on the output grid.\n    *   **4x4 Hollow Blue Square (1):** If a 4x4 hollow square of blue is found with its top-left corner at (r, c), draw an identical 4x4 hollow square of blue (1) at (r, c) on the output grid.\n3.  **Default:** Any input pixels or patterns not matching the above rules are ignored, leaving the corresponding output pixels as white (0).\n4.  **Overlapping:** Transformations are drawn onto the output grid. If transformations overlap, the later drawing operations overwrite earlier ones (though the specific order of pattern checks here aims to avoid problematic overlaps based on examples).\n\"\"\"\n\ndef draw_hollow_square(grid, r, c, size, color):\n    \"\"\"Draws the perimeter of a square on the grid.\"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    # Ensure drawing stays within bounds (although bounds are checked before calling)\n    if r + size <= height and c + size <= width:\n        # Top row\n        grid[r, c:c+size] = color\n        # Bottom row\n        grid[r+size-1, c:c+size] = color\n        # Left column (excluding corners)\n        grid[r+1:r+size-1, c] = color\n        # Right column (excluding corners)\n        grid[r+1:r+size-1, c+size-1] = color\n\ndef draw_solid_square(grid, r, c, size, color):\n    \"\"\"Draws a filled square on the grid.\"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n     # Ensure drawing stays within bounds\n    if r >= 0 and c >= 0 and r + size <= height and c + size <= width:\n        grid[r:r+size, c:c+size] = color\n\ndef is_hollow_square(grid, r, c, size, color):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a hollow square of given size and color exists at (r, c).\"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    # Check bounds for the square itself\n    if r + size > height or c + size > width:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check top row\n    if not np.all(grid[r, c:c+size] == color):\n        return False\n    # Check bottom row\n    if not np.all(grid[r+size-1, c:c+size] == color):\n        return False\n    # Check left column (excluding corners)\n    if size > 1 and not np.all(grid[r+1:r+size-1, c] == color):\n        return False\n    # Check right column (excluding corners)\n    if size > 1 and not np.all(grid[r+1:r+size-1, c+size-1] == color):\n        return False\n    # Check interior (should be white=0)\n    if size > 2 and not np.all(grid[r+1:r+size-1, c+1:c+size-1] == 0):\n        return False\n        \n    return True\n\ndef is_solid_square(grid, r, c, size, color):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a solid square of given size and color exists at (r, c).\"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    if r + size > height or c + size > width:\n        return False\n    return np.all(grid[r:r+size, c:c+size] == color)\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rules to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n    output_np = np.zeros_like(input_np)\n\n    # Iterate through each cell as a potential top-left corner or single pixel location\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            \n            # Rule: Check for 4x4 Hollow Blue Square (1)\n            # We check this first as it's a larger specific pattern\n            if input_np[r, c] == 1 and is_hollow_square(input_np, r, c, 4, 1):\n                # Draw the same square in the output\n                draw_hollow_square(output_np, r, c, 4, 1)\n                # Potentially mark checked cells to avoid re-processing?\n                # For now, rely on the fact that checks are specific enough.\n\n            # Rule: Check for 2x2 Magenta Square (6)\n            elif input_np[r, c] == 6 and is_solid_square(input_np, r, c, 2, 6):\n                 # Check if the shifted position is valid\n                if r > 0 and c > 0:\n                    # Draw the shifted square in the output\n                    draw_solid_square(output_np, r-1, c-1, 2, 6)\n\n            # Rule: Check for Single Red Pixel (2)\n            elif input_np[r, c] == 2:\n                # Check if a 4x4 expansion fits within bounds\n                if r + 3 < height and c + 3 < width:\n                    # Draw 4x4 hollow yellow square\n                    draw_hollow_square(output_np, r, c, 4, 4) # 4 is yellow\n\n            # Rule: Check for Single Green Pixel (3)\n            elif input_np[r, c] == 3:\n                 # Check if a 4x4 expansion fits within bounds\n                if r + 3 < height and c + 3 < width:\n                     # Draw 4x4 hollow blue square\n                    draw_hollow_square(output_np, r, c, 4, 1) # 1 is blue\n\n            # Other pixels/patterns are implicitly ignored as output starts white\n\n    return output_np.tolist()\n\n```"
