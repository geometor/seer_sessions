## Assessment and Strategy

The previous code failed because the gap-filling logic was incorrect. It specifically looked for gaps of exactly three background pixels between two foreground pixels (`FG BG BG BG FG`). The examples show that:

1.  **Variable Gap Length:** Gaps of different lengths need to be filled (e.g., length 2 in Example 1, row 9; length 3 in Example 1, row 7; length 3 in Example 2, row 9).
2.  **Correct Rule:** The actual rule seems to be: fill any horizontal sequence of one or more background pixels if it is immediately preceded and followed by foreground pixels *on the same row*, considering the grid *after* isolated pixels have been removed.

The strategy is to:
1.  Keep the isolated pixel removal logic as it appears correct (it removed the pixel at `(3, 19)` in Ex1 and correctly identified the pixel at `(9, 23)` in Ex2 as isolated based on the *input* state).
2.  Implement a more general horizontal gap-filling algorithm that works on the `cleaned_grid` and fills gaps of any length > 0.

## Metrics

Let's analyze the differences row by row for the failed examples using the provided transformed output from the previous attempt.
