task_context:
  description: "The task involves modifying a grid by cleaning up isolated foreground pixels and filling horizontal gaps between foreground pixels."
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions_vary: True
    - background_color_varies: True # Example 1: Blue (1), Example 2: White (0)
    - foreground_color_varies: True # Example 1: Magenta (6), Example 2: Green (3)

elements:
  - object: background_pixel
    properties:
      - color: Most frequent color in the input grid (e.g., Blue=1 or White=0)
      - role: Fills most of the grid area initially. Can be part of gaps.
  - object: foreground_pixel
    properties:
      - color: The less frequent, non-background color (e.g., Magenta=6 or Green=3)
      - role: Forms patterns, lines, or scattered points. Can be isolated or connected.
  - object: isolated_foreground_pixel
    description: A foreground_pixel with no adjacent (horizontal or vertical) neighbors of the same foreground color.
    properties:
      - color: Foreground color
      - location: Specific row and column
      - condition: All four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) have the background color.
  - object: horizontal_gap
    description: A sequence of one or more background pixels on a single row.
    properties:
      - content: Sequence of background_pixels
      - location: Specific row and column range
      - condition: Immediately preceded and followed by a foreground_pixel on the same row.

actions:
  - action: identify_colors
    description: Determine the background and foreground colors based on frequency in the input grid.
  - action: cleanup_isolated_pixels
    description: Iterate through all foreground pixels. If a pixel is identified as isolated, change its color to the background color.
    input: grid, background_color, foreground_color
    output: modified_grid
  - action: fill_horizontal_gaps
    description: Iterate through each row of the (potentially modified) grid. Find horizontal gaps flanked by foreground pixels and fill them with the foreground color.
    input: grid, background_color, foreground_color
    output: final_grid

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share an edge (horizontally or vertically). Used to determine isolation.
  - type: horizontal_betweenness
    description: A background pixel (or sequence) is between two foreground pixels if they are on the same row, and the background pixel(s) are located at columns strictly between the columns of the foreground pixels, with no other foreground pixels intervening in that row segment. Used for gap filling.
