Identify Colors: Determine the background color (most common) and foreground color (other color).\n2.  Create a Working Copy: Start with a copy of the input grid.\n3.  Cleanup Isolated Pixels: \n    - Iterate through each pixel of the original input grid.\n    - If a pixel has the foreground color, check its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) in the original input.\n    - If *none* of these neighbors have the foreground color, change the corresponding pixel in the working copy to the background color.\n4.  Fill Horizontal Gaps:\n    - Iterate through each row of the grid resulting from Step 3.\n    - Within each row, scan from left to right. \n    - Find sequences of `[Foreground Pixel] [One or more Background Pixels] [Foreground Pixel]`.\n    - Change all the background pixels within such identified sequences to the foreground color.\n5.
