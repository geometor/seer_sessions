1.  Identify Colors: Determine the background color (most common) and foreground color (other color).
2.  Create a Working Copy: Start with a copy of the input grid.
3.  Cleanup Isolated Pixels: 
    - Iterate through each pixel of the original input grid.
    - If a pixel has the foreground color, check its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) in the original input.
    - If *none* of these neighbors have the foreground color, change the corresponding pixel in the working copy to the background color.
4.  Fill Horizontal Gaps:
    - Iterate through each row of the grid resulting from Step 3.
    - Within each row, scan from left to right. 
    - Find sequences of `[Foreground Pixel] [One or more Background Pixels] [Foreground Pixel]`.
    - Change all the background pixels within such identified sequences to the foreground color.
5.  Output: Return the modified grid after filling the gaps.
