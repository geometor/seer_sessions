The core transformation observed across all examples targets solid 3x3 squares of a single color. Other shapes and pixels remain unchanged in the output. Specifically, the center pixel and the four corner pixels of each identified 3x3 solid square are changed to white in the output grid, effectively leaving a hollow 'plus' shape. This operation applies regardless of the color of the 3x3 square or its position within the grid.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with white pixels (or create a copy of the input grid).\n    2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid, considering it as a potential center of a 3x3 square (i.e., check pixels from row 1 to height-2 and column 1 to width-2).\n    3.  For each potential center pixel:\n        a.  Check if the 3x3 block centered at this pixel is a solid square of a single, non-white color. This means the center pixel and its 8 immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) must all have the same color, and this color must not be white (0).\n        b.  If it is a solid 3x3 square:\n            i.  In the output grid, set the color of the center pixel to white (0).\n            ii. In the output grid, set the color of the four corner pixels relative to the center (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) to white (0).\n            iii. Ensure the four side-adjacent pixels (top, bottom, left, right relative to the center) retain the original color of the square. (If starting with a copy, these are already correct. If starting with a white grid, copy these four pixels from the input).\n    4.  For all pixels in the input grid that were *not* identified as the center or corners of a solid 3x3 square modified in step 3, copy their color directly from the input grid to the corresponding position in the output grid. (If starting with a copy of the input, these pixels are already correct unless they were overwritten as corners/centers of an identified square).\n    5.  Return the modified output grid.\n    *(Self-correction: A simpler approach than initializing to white is to copy the input grid entirely to the output grid first. Then, iterate and find the 3x3 squares. For each found square, modify only its center and corner pixels in the output grid to white.)*\n\n    **Revised Natural Language Program:**\n    1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.\n    2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid that could potentially be the center of a 3x3 square (i.e., excluding borders: row index from 1 to height-2, column index from 1 to width-2).\n    3.  For each potential center pixel (at row `r`, column `c`):\n        a.  Check if the 3x3 block centered at `(r, c)` in the *input* grid is a solid square of a single, non-white color. Let this color be `C`. This means `input[r+dr][c+dc] == C` for all `dr` in `{-1, 0, 1}` and `dc` in `{-1, 0, 1}`, and `C != 0`.\n        b.  If it is a solid 3x3 square of color `C`:\n            i.  Set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to white (0).\n            ii. Set the pixels at `(r-1, c-1)`, `(r-1, c+1)`, `(r+1, c-1)`, and `(r+1, c+1)` in the *output* grid to white (0).\n    4.  Return the final output grid."
