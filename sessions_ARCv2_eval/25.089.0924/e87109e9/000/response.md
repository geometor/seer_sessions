Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grid is consistently divided into two main sections separated by a horizontal line of gray (5) pixels.
2.  **Top Section ("Keys"):** This section appears to define a set of rules or parameters. It contains small, isolated patterns bordered by gray (5). Each pattern consists of a single non-white pixel adjacent to three white (0) pixels. The non-white colors in these patterns vary across examples (e.g., blue, magenta, yellow, red in train\_1).
3.  **Bottom Section ("Main Grid"):** This is the primary canvas for the transformation. It has a background color (green in train\_1, blue in train\_2, orange in train\_3) and contains various colored objects or shapes. Notably, a 2x2 square of azure (8) pixels is always present somewhere within this section in the input, though its location varies.
4.  **Output Structure:** The output grid corresponds in size to the *bottom section* (main grid) of the input. The top "key" section is absent.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing parts of the main grid to azure (8). The original shapes and background are partially preserved. The azure color seems to spread or be stamped in 2x2 blocks. Crucially, areas containing the specific colors identified in the top "key" section seem resistant to being overwritten by azure. The original 2x2 azure block in the input does not seem to dictate the *location* of the stamping, but rather the *color* used for stamping (azure) and perhaps the *size* (2x2).

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
task_context:
  description: Transform the main grid based on color keys defined in a separate top panel.
  input_structure:
    - type: separator
      color: gray (5)
      orientation: horizontal
      location: divides grid into top and bottom sections
    - type: key_panel
      location: top section (above separator)
      content: multiple gray-bordered 1x4 or 4x1 patterns containing one non-white color and three white pixels.
      purpose: defines a set of 'protected' colors.
    - type: main_grid
      location: bottom section (below separator)
      content: background color, various colored shapes, includes a 2x2 azure (8) square.
      purpose: the area to be transformed.
  output_structure:
    - type: grid
      size: matches the input's main_grid size.
      content: modified version of the input's main_grid.

objects:
  - id: key_colors
    source: non-white pixels adjacent to white pixels in the key_panel.
    property: 'protected' - these colors resist overwriting.
  - id: main_grid_pixels
    source: all pixels in the main_grid section of the input.
  - id: stamp_color
    value: azure (8)
  - id: stamp_unit
    shape: 2x2 square

actions:
  - action: extract_keys
    input: key_panel
    output: set of protected key_colors
  - action: copy_grid
    input: main_grid
    output: initial output_grid
  - action: iterate_and_stamp
    target: output_grid
    unit: 2x2 blocks
    condition: check if any pixel within the corresponding 2x2 block in the input main_grid belongs to the set of key_colors.
    effect:
      - if condition is FALSE: overwrite the 2x2 block in the output_grid with the stamp_color (azure).
      - if condition is TRUE: leave the 2x2 block in the output_grid unchanged (preserving original colors).

relationships:
  - type: protection
    subject: pixels in the main_grid matching key_colors
    effect: prevent overwriting by the azure stamp in their containing 2x2 block.
  - type: spatial_grouping
    granularity: 2x2 blocks
    purpose: determines the unit of checking and potential stamping.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Separate the input grid into two parts: the "key panel" (top section above the solid gray line) and the "main grid" (bottom section below the gray line).
2.  Identify the set of "protected colors" by finding all unique non-white colors that are located next to a white pixel within the gray-bordered patterns in the key panel.
3.  Create a new grid (the output grid) that is initially an exact copy of the input's main grid.
4.  Iterate through every possible 2x2 block of pixels in the input's main grid. Define a block by its top-left corner's row (r) and column (c). The block includes pixels at (r, c), (r+1, c), (r, c+1), and (r+1, c+1).
5.  For each 2x2 block in the input's main grid, check if *any* of its four pixels have a color that is present in the set of "protected colors" identified in step 2.
6.  If *none* of the four pixels in the input 2x2 block match any of the protected colors, then change the corresponding 2x2 block of pixels in the output grid to be entirely azure (8).
7.  If *at least one* pixel in the input 2x2 block *does* match a protected color, make no changes to the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid (it retains the colors copied in step 3).
8.  After iterating through all possible 2x2 blocks, the resulting output grid is the final result.
