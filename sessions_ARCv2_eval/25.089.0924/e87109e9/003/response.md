Transformation Rule:

1. Identify the functional horizontal separator line within the input grid. This 
   is the *last* row index consisting entirely of gray (5) pixels.
2. Split the input grid based on the separator row:
   - The "key panel" is the section between row 0 (exclusive, assuming row 0 is a border) 
     and the separator row (exclusive).
   - The "main grid" includes all rows below the separator row.
3. Extract a set of "protected colors" from the key panel. A color is protected if 
   it's not white (0), not gray (5), and is adjacent (4-connectivity) to at least 
   one white (0) pixel within the key panel.
4. Initialize an output grid as an exact copy of the input's main grid.
5. Iterate through the input's main grid using a 2x2 sliding window, defined by its 
   top-left corner (r, c).
6. For each 2x2 window in the input's main grid:
   - Check if *any* of the four pixels within this window contains a color present 
     in the set of protected colors.
   - If *none* of the pixels are protected colors, change the corresponding 2x2 
     block in the output grid to be entirely azure (8).
   - If *at least one* pixel is a protected color, leave the corresponding 2x2 
     block in the output grid unchanged.
7. Return the final output grid.
