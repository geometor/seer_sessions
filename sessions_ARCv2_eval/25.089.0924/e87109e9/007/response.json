Identify the 'separator row' which is the last row in the input grid \n   consisting entirely of gray (5) pixels.\n2. Divide the input grid:\n   - The 'key panel' consists of the rows between the top row (row 0, assumed \n     to be a gray border) and the separator row (exclusive).\n   - The 'main grid' consists of all rows below the separator row.\n3. Extract the 'protected colors set' from the key panel: Find all unique \n   colors that are not white (0) and not gray (5), and are adjacent \n   (4-connectivity) to at least one white (0) pixel within the key panel.\n4. Create a new grid (the output grid) that is initially an exact copy of \n   the input's main grid.\n5. Iterate through every possible 2x2 block of pixels in the *input's* main \n   grid, defined by its top-left corner (r, c).\n6. For each 2x2 block in the input's main grid, check if *any* of its four \n   pixels have a color that is present in the 'protected colors set'.\n7. If *none* of the four pixels in the input 2x2 block match any of the \n   protected colors, then change the corresponding 2x2 block of pixels in \n   the *output* grid to be entirely azure (8).\n8. If *at least one* pixel in the input 2x2 block *does* match a protected \n   color, make no changes to the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid.\n9.
