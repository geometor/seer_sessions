Identify the main horizontal band: Find the most frequent non-white color ('base_color') in the input grid. Determine the topmost row ('min_row') where this 'base_color' first appears. This row marks the upper boundary of the main band area.\n2. Project colors downwards: For every white pixel (hole) located at or below 'min_row', look vertically upwards in the same column. Find the first non-white pixel encountered in the rows above 'min_row'. \n3. Fill holes: Fill the white hole in the output grid with the color found in step 2. If no non-white pixel is found above, the hole remains white.\n4. Clear upper area: Set all pixels in the output grid in rows above 'min_row' to white (0).\n5. Preserve the rest: Pixels at or below 'min_row' that are not white holes retain their original color from the input grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_base_color_and_min_row(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the most frequent non-white color and the first row it appears in.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (base_color, min_row)\n               base_color (int): The most frequent non-white color.\n               min_row (int): The index of the first row containing the base_color.\n               Returns (0, grid.shape[0]) if grid is all white or empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    counts = Counter()\n    min_row_for_color = {}\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    # Count non-white colors and find their first appearance row\n    found_non_white = False\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            color = grid[r, c]\n            if color != 0: # Ignore white background\n                found_non_white = True\n                counts[color] += 1\n                if color not in min_row_for_color:\n                    min_row_for_color[color] = r\n\n    if not found_non_white: # Grid is all white or empty\n        return 0, rows\n\n    # Find the most frequent non-white color\n    base_color = counts.most_common(1)[0][0]\n\n    # Get the min_row for this base_color\n    min_row = min_row_for_color.get(base_color, rows) # Default to rows if base_color somehow not in dict (shouldn't happen if found_non_white)\n\n    return base_color, min_row\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid represented as a list of lists.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    rows, cols = input_np.shape\n\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_np)\n\n    # 1.
