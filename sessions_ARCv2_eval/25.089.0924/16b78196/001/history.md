*   **Perception:** The input grid contains several distinct objects (colored shapes) scattered, primarily in the upper and lower portions, against a white background. A prominent feature is a large, thick horizontal band of a single color (red in train_1, azure in train_2) located roughly in the middle or lower-middle section. This band contains several white pixels ("holes"). Above this band, there are other smaller colored shapes. The transformation involves these upper shapes "raining" or "projecting" their colors downwards. When a color projection hits a white hole within the main colored band, the hole adopts that color in the output. The original shapes above the band disappear in the output, turning white. If multiple colors are stacked vertically above a hole, the color of the lowest non-white pixel above the hole is the one that fills it. The main colored band itself remains otherwise unchanged.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    elements:
      - object: base_block
        description: A large, predominantly horizontal block of a single non-white color (e.g., red, azure), potentially containing holes.
        properties:
          - color: The single non-white color composing the block (e.g., 2 or 8).
          - vertical_range: Defined by the minimum (topmost) and maximum (bottommost) row indices containing the base_color. Let min_row be the top boundary.
          - holes: Pixels within the vertical_range of the base_block that have the color white (0) in the input grid.
      - object: source_shapes
        description: One or more distinct shapes composed of non-white pixels located entirely above the base_block (rows < min_row).
        properties:
          - color: The color of the pixels composing each shape.
          - position: Located at rows strictly less than min_row.
      - object: background
        description: Pixels with the color white (0) that are not holes within the base_block.

    actions:
      - action: identify_base_block
        description: Determine the base_color and its top row boundary (min_row) by finding the first row from the top containing the most frequent non-white color that forms a large band.
      - action: project_and_fill
        description: For each pixel (r, c) where r >= min_row and the input pixel is a hole (white=0), find the color of the first non-white pixel encountered when scanning upwards from (r-1, c) to row 0. If found, update the output pixel (r, c) with this color.
      - action: clear_source_area
        description: In the output grid, set all pixels in rows above min_row (r < min_row) to white (0).

    relationships:
      - relationship: vertical_projection
        description: Colors from source_shapes project vertically downwards onto holes within the base_block.
      - relationship: occlusion
        description: When multiple source_shape pixels align vertically above a hole, only the color of the lowest (closest to the base_block) non-white pixel is projected onto the hole.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify the primary color (`base_color`) that forms the large horizontal band and find the uppermost row index (`min_row`) where this `base_color` appears.
    3.  Iterate through each column `c` of the grid.
    4.  Iterate through each row `r` from `min_row` down to the last row of the grid.
    5.  If the pixel at `input[r][c]` is white (0):
        a.  Initialize a `paint_color` variable to white (0).
        b.  Scan upwards from row `k = r - 1` to row `0` in the same column `c`.
        c.  If a non-white pixel `input[k][c]` is found, set `paint_color` to the color of `input[k][c]` and stop the upward scan for this hole.
        d.  Set the pixel at `output[r][c]` to the final `paint_color`.
    6.  After checking all relevant pixels (steps 3-5), iterate through all rows `r` from 0 up to (but not including) `min_row`.
    7.  For each column `c`, set the pixel `output[r][c]` to white (0).
    8.  Return the modified output grid.
