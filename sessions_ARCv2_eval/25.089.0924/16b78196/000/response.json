A prominent feature is a large, thick horizontal band of a single color (red in train_1, azure in train_2) located roughly in the middle or lower-middle section. This band contains several white pixels (\"holes\"). Above this band, there are other smaller colored shapes. The transformation involves these upper shapes \"raining\" or \"projecting\" their colors downwards. When a color projection hits a white hole within the main colored band, the hole adopts that color in the output. The original shapes above the band disappear in the output, turning white. If multiple colors are stacked vertically above a hole, the color of the lowest non-white pixel above the hole is the one that fills it. The main colored band itself remains otherwise unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
