            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the 7x7 block structure and the output dimension (Nx7), but incorrectly assumed the output was simply the first 7 columns of the input. The failed test cases reveal a more complex selection process is involved. The transformation selects a specific 7x7 vertical block *pattern* for each horizontal *band* of blocks in the input, based on some criteria, and uses that selected pattern to construct the output for that band.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify Blocks:** Parse the input grid into its constituent 7x7 blocks, respecting the boundary lines. The grid seems composed of horizontal \"bands\" of these blocks (rows 0-6, 7-13, 14-20, etc.).\n2.  **Analyze Bands:** For each horizontal band (e.g., input rows 0-6), compare all the 7x7 blocks within that band.\n3.  **Determine Selection Rule:** The key is to find the rule used to select *one* representative block pattern for each band. The previous tests suggest a \"least frequent pattern\" rule:\n    *   For each band, count the occurrences of each unique 7x7 block pattern.\n    *   Identify the pattern(s) that occur least frequently.\n    *   If there's only one least frequent pattern, select it.\n    *   If there's a tie for least frequent (e.g., multiple patterns appear only once, or all patterns are identical), select the *first* (leftmost) block in the band that exhibits one of these least frequent patterns.\n4.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid by vertically stacking the selected 7x7 block patterns for each band.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nLet's analyze the block patterns and their frequencies within each band for both examples. A \"band\" corresponds to 7 rows of the input (0-6, 7-13, 14-20). A \"block\" is a 7x7 subgrid starting at column 0, 7, 14, etc.\n\n"
