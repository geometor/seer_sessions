task_description: Replace specific solid white rectangular areas with the content found within the bounding box of a corresponding non-white object located above it.

definitions:
  - object: pattern
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels (color > 0). The relevant part is the content within its minimal bounding box.
  - object: canvas
    description: A solid rectangular area composed entirely of white pixels (color 0).
  - property: dimensions
    description: Height (H) and Width (W) of a bounding box or a rectangular area.
  - property: column_span
    description: The range of columns occupied by an object or area (column_start, column_end).
  - property: location
    description: The bounding box coordinates (row_start, col_start, row_end, col_end).

relationships:
  - type: pairing
    description: A pattern object is paired with a canvas object.
    conditions:
      - The dimensions (H, W) of the pattern object's bounding box must be identical to the dimensions of the canvas rectangle.
      - The column_span of the pattern object's bounding box must be identical to the column_span of the canvas rectangle.
      - The canvas rectangle must be located entirely below the pattern object's bounding box (canvas.row_start > pattern.row_end).
      - Among potential canvases satisfying these conditions for a given pattern, the topmost one (minimum canvas.row_start) is selected.
  - type: spatial
    description: Pattern object is always located vertically above its corresponding canvas object.

actions:
  - action: find_patterns
    description: Identify all non-white objects and determine their bounding boxes.
  - action: find_canvas
    description: For each pattern object, search below it within the same column span for the highest solid white rectangle matching the pattern's bounding box dimensions.
  - action: copy_content
    description: Extract the pixel data from within the pattern object's bounding box.
  - action: replace_canvas
    description: Overwrite the pixels in the identified canvas rectangle location with the extracted pattern content in the output grid.
  - rule: transformation
    description: Iterate through each found pattern object. Find its corresponding canvas object based on dimensions, column span, and vertical position. If found, perform the copy_content and replace_canvas actions. The original grid content is preserved unless replaced.
