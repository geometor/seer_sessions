InitialObjects:
  - Type: Grid
    Properties:
      - Height: Varies (e.g., 28, 23, 20)
      - Width: Varies (e.g., 23, 25, 15)
      - Pixels:
          - Color: Blue (1) - Forms one or more contiguous shapes.
          - Color: Yellow (4) - Forms background and potentially shapes adjacent to or enclosed by Blue shapes.

Transformations:
  - Action: Framing
    Input: Yellow pixels adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to Blue pixels.
    Output: These pixels change color to Red (2).
    OutputName: FramePixels

  - Action: Outer Filling
    Input: Yellow pixels, not part of FramePixels, that are adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to FramePixels.
    Output: These pixels change color to Azure (8).
    OutputName: OuterFillPixels

  - Action: Inner Filling
    Input: Yellow pixels, not part of FramePixels or OuterFillPixels, that are part of the same connected Yellow region initially affected by the framing/filling.
    Output: These pixels change color to Magenta (6).
    OutputName: InnerFillPixels

  - Action: Preservation
    Input: Blue pixels.
    Output: Generally remain Blue (1). (Exception: Some Blue pixels might change, rule TBD - potentially related to isolation or neighbor states after filling).

  - Action: Preservation
    Input: Yellow pixels not involved in Framing, Outer Filling, or Inner Filling (i.e., background Yellow not connected to the Blue interaction zone).
    Output: Remain Yellow (4).

FinalObjects:
  - Type: Grid
    Properties:
      - Same dimensions as Input Grid.
      - Pixels:
          - Color: Blue (1) - Original blue pixels (mostly).
          - Color: Red (2) - FramePixels.
          - Color: Azure (8) - OuterFillPixels (and maybe some original Blue pixels).
          - Color: Magenta (6) - InnerFillPixels (and maybe some original Blue pixels).
          - Color: Yellow (4) - Unchanged background Yellow pixels.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Orthogonal and diagonal adjacency is key for all color changes (Frame, OuterFill, InnerFill).
  - Connectivity: The transformation seems primarily focused on the connected component(s) of Yellow pixels that touch the initial Blue shapes.
