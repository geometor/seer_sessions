But it's solid 8s.\n\nWhat if the process is:\n1. Find the unique, solid, rectangular block of color 8 (azure). (Rows 19-21, Cols 12-18). Let's call its bounding box B.\n2. The output grid width is the width of B (7 columns).\n3. The output grid height is 3.\n4. The output rows are extracted from the input grid, using the columns from B (12-18).\n5. The specific rows are 10, 11, and 17. How are these chosen?\n\nLook at the input grid structure again.\n- Row 10: `6 6 4 4 6 7 2 7 4 3 4 4 |7 6 9 7 7 9 6| 7 4 4 3 4 7 2 7 6 4 4`\n- Row 11: `9 9 6 6 7 2 5 1 3 7 3 7 |6 7 7 9 9 7 7| 3 7 3 1 5 2 7 6 6`\n- Row 17: `2 7 1 5 4 6 2 9 9 5 6 6 |3 7 4 4 4 4 7| 6 6 5 9 9 2 6 4 5 1`\n\nAre these rows special somehow? Do they contain patterns?\n- Row 10 has `7 6 9 7 7 9 6`\n- Row 11 has `6 7 7 9 9 7 7`\n- Row 17 has `3 7 4 4 4 4 7`\n\nThe output puts them in the order: Row 17, Row 11, Row 10.\nWhy this order? 17 -> 11 -> 10. Decreasing row index.\n\nCould it be related to some other feature?\nWhat about the blocks of 5s (gray)?\n- (2, 14)-(2, 17)\n- (3, 14)-(4, 17)\n- (6, 12)-(7, 13)\n- (6, 18)-(7, 19)\n- (10, 6)-(11, 7)\n- (10, 22)-(11, 23)\n- (12, 7)-(13, 8)\n- (12, 21)-(13, 22)\n- (14, 2)-(15, 3)\n- (14, 26)-(15, 27)\n- (18, 3)-(19, 4)\n- (18, 25)-(19, 26)\n- (20, 7)-(21, 8)\n- (20, 21)-(21, 22)\n- (24, 11)-(25, 12)\n- (24, 17)-(25, 18)\n- (26, 4)-(27, 5)\n- (26, 24)-(27, 25)\n- (28, 14)-(28, 17)\n- (29, 14)-(29, 17)\nThese seem symmetrically placed. None directly overlap Cols 12-18 in rows 10, 11, 17.\n\nLet's assume the logic is:\n1. Find the solid azure (8) rectangle. (R=19-21, C=12-18)\n2. Identify the column range C (12-18).\n3. Find all rows in the input grid where the slice defined by columns C contains a horizontally symmetrical pattern.\n    - Row 10 slice: `7 6 9 7 7 9 6`. Is this symmetrical? `7!=6`, `6!=9`, `9!=7`. No.\n    - Row 11 slice: `6 7 7 9 9 7 7`. Is this symmetrical? `6!=7`, `7==7`, `7==9`. No.\n    - Row 17 slice: `3 7 4 4 4 4 7`. Is this symmetrical? `3!=7`, `7!=4`, `4==4`. No.\nThis hypothesis is wrong.\n\nLet's reconsider symmetry. The whole input grid looks symmetrical, ignoring the 8s block.\nMaybe the 8s block indicates the region *not* to consider, or the region to use as a reference?\n\nWhat if we find the axis of vertical symmetry? Column 14/15.\nWhat if we find the axis of horizontal symmetry? Row 14/15.\n\nThe 8s block is at R 19-21, C 12-18.\nThe output rows come from R 10, 11, 17 and C 12-18.\n\nMaybe the rows are chosen based on their distance to the horizontal axis of symmetry (14.5)?\n- Row 10: distance |10 - 14.5| = 4.5\n- Row 11: distance |11 - 14.5| = 3.5\n- Row 17: distance |17 - 14.5| = 2.5\n\nThe output order is R17, R11, R10. This corresponds to increasing distance from the center? 2.5, 3.5, 4.5. Yes.\n\nSo the hypothesis is:\n1. Find the solid azure (8) rectangle. Define its column range C.\n2. Find the horizontal axis of symmetry of the grid (or perhaps the pattern excluding the 8s). Let it be H.\n3. Find all rows R such that the slice Input[R, C] exists.\n4. Select a subset of these rows based on some criteria (which rows?). In this case, rows 10, 11, 17 were selected. Why these?\n5. Sort these selected rows based on their distance to the horizontal axis H.\n6. Construct the output grid from these sorted row slices.\n\nWhy rows 10, 11, 17? What is special about them?\n- Row 10 slice: `7 6 9 7 7 9 6`\n- Row 11 slice: `6 7 7 9 9 7 7`\n- Row 17 slice: `3 7 4 4 4 4 7`\n\nAre these the *only* rows with interesting patterns in columns 12-18?\nLet's look at other rows in that column range:\n- Row 0: `7 6 7 2 2 7 6`\n- Row 1: `6 7 2 7 7 2 7`\n- Row 2: `7 2 5 1 1 5 2`\n- Row 3: `2 7 5 5 5 5 7`\n- Row 4: `9 2 6 4 4 6 2`\n- Row 5: `9 9 4 6 6 4 9`\n- Row 6: `4 5 9 2 2 9 5`\n- Row 7: `1 5 5 4 9 9 9`\n- Row 8: `9 7 7 6 6 7 7` (Same as Row 23!)\n- Row 9: `6 7 7 6 9 7 4`\n- Row 10: `7 6 9 7 7 9 6` (Output Row 3)\n- Row 11: `6 7 7 9 9 7 7` (Output Row 2)\n- Row 12: `3 7 4 4 4 4 7` (Output Row 1, also Row 17!) -> Row 12 slice: `3 7 4 4 4 4 7`. Recheck Input Row 12: `7 6 7 2 9 9 4 5 6 6 5 9 |3 7 4 4 4 4 7| 3 9 5 6 6 5 4 9 9 2 7`. Yes!\n- Row 13: `4 3 4 1 1 4 3` (Same as Row 18!)\n- Row 14: `7 7 3 7 7 3 7`\n- Row 15: `7 3 4 3 3 4 3` (Same as Row 16!)\n- Row 16: `7 3 4 3 3 4 3` (Same as Row 15!)\n- Row 17: `3 7 4 4 4 4 7` (Output Row 1, same as Row 12!)\n- Row 18: `4 3 4 1 1 4 3` (Same as Row 13!)\n- Rows 19-21: `8 8 8 8 8 8 8`\n- Row 22: `7 9 6 7 7 6 9`\n- Row 23: `9 7 7 6 6 7 7` (Same as Row 8!)\n- Row 24: `2 7 1 5 5 4 9`\n- Row 25: `5 5 4 5 9 2 2`\n- Row 26: `9 9 4 6 6 4 9` (Same as Row 5!)\n- Row 27: `9 2 6 4 4 6 2` (Same as Row 4!)\n- Row 28: `2 7 5 5 5 5 7` (Same as Row 3!)\n- Row 29: `7 2 5 1 1 5 2` (Same as Row 2!)\n\nOkay, the input grid (excluding the 8s) is highly symmetrical vertically! Rows N and (29-N) have identical slices in columns 12-18 for N=2,3,4,5, 8. Rows 15 and 16 are identical. Rows 12 and 17 are identical. Rows 13 and 18 are identical.\n\nThe output uses slices from rows 10, 11, 17.\n- Row 10 slice: `7 6 9 7 7 9 6` (Unique in this column range?)\n- Row 11 slice: `6 7 7 9 9 7 7` (Unique in this column range?)\n- Row 17 slice: `3 7 4 4 4 4 7` (Appears also in Row 12).\n\nWhy these three specific patterns? Are they the only unique patterns above the halfway point (row 14.5)?\nLet's list unique patterns above row 14.5 (i.e., rows 0-14) in columns 12-18:\n- Row 0: `7 6 7 2 2 7 6`\n- Row 1: `6 7 2 7 7 2 7`\n- Row 2: `7 2 5 1 1 5 2` (Duplicate is Row 29)\n- Row 3: `2 7 5 5 5 5 7` (Duplicate is Row 28)\n- Row 4: `9 2 6 4 4 6 2` (Duplicate is Row 27)\n- Row 5: `9 9 4 6 6 4 9` (Duplicate is Row 26)\n- Row 6: `4 5 9 2 2 9 5`\n- Row 7: `1 5 5 4 9 9 9`\n- Row 8: `9 7 7 6 6 7 7` (Duplicate is Row 23)\n- Row 9: `6 7 7 6 9 7 4`\n- Row 10: `7 6 9 7 7 9 6` (Used in Output Row 3)\n- Row 11: `6 7 7 9 9 7 7` (Used in Output Row 2)\n- Row 12: `3 7 4 4 4 4 7` (Used in Output Row 1, Duplicate is Row 17)\n- Row 13: `4 3 4 1 1 4 3` (Duplicate is Row 18)\n- Row 14: `7 7 3 7 7 3 7`\n\nThe unique patterns in rows 0-14, cols 12-18 are from rows: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14. (And rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 12, 13 have duplicates below the center).\nThe output uses patterns from rows 10, 11, 12/17. Why these three?\n\nWhat if the criterion is \"patterns that appear exactly twice symmetrically around the center\"?\n- Row 2 / Row 29 pattern: `7 2 5 1 1 5 2`\n- Row 3 / Row 28 pattern: `2 7 5 5 5 5 7`\n- Row 4 / Row 27 pattern: `9 2 6 4 4 6 2`\n- Row 5 / Row 26 pattern: `9 9 4 6 6 4 9`\n- Row 8 / Row 23 pattern: `9 7 7 6 6 7 7`\n- Row 12 / Row 17 pattern: `3 7 4 4 4"
