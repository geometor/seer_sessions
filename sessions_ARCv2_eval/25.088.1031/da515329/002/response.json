The code preserved dimensions correctly.\n*   **Color Palette:** Only white (0) and azure (8) are used in inputs and outputs. The code used the correct colors.\n*   **Azure Count:** The number of azure pixels increases significantly from input to output in all expected outputs. The transformed outputs from the previous code also increased the azure count, but not nearly enough and in the wrong places.\n*   **Pattern:** The output patterns are complex and fill a large portion of the grid, originating from the initial small 'seed' of azure pixels. The pattern looks somewhat like a Sierpinski triangle or related fractal/cellular automaton pattern. Let's investigate Rule 90 specifically.\n\n**Rule 90:**\nRule 90 is a 1D elementary cellular automaton where a cell's next state is the XOR (sum modulo 2) of its left and right neighbors' states in the previous step.\n`new_state(i) = state(i-1) XOR state(i+1)`\n\n**Hypothesis: 2D Adaptation of Rule 90?**\nHow could Rule 90 be adapted to 2D with an 8-neighbor (Moore) neighborhood?\n*   Previous code: `new_state(r, c) = sum(neighbors) % 2`. This failed.\n*   What if we consider diagonal neighbors? Rule 90 uses the two neighbors in 1D. In 2D, perhaps the relevant neighbors are the diagonal ones? Let's test this: `new_state(r, c) = (state(r-1, c-1) + state(r-1, c+1) + state(r+1, c-1) + state(r+1, c+1)) % 2`. (Assuming state is 0 or 1, mapping azure to 1).\n*   What if it considers cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right)? `new_state(r, c) = (state(r-1, c) + state(r+1, c) + state(r, c-1) + state(r, c+1)) % 2`.\n*   What if the cell's own state is involved? `new_state(r, c) = (state(r, c) + sum(neighbors)) % 2`? Unlikely for Rule 90 type patterns.\n\nLet's manually check the \"cardinal neighbors sum mod 2\" hypothesis on a small section of Example 2's input.\nInput:\n"

This \"cardinal neighbors sum mod 2\" rule seems plausible for generating patterns like the output.

The rule is: a cell's next state is azure (8) if the sum of the states (0 for white, 1 for azure) of its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) in the previous state is odd.

Return the final grid.## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code implemented a cellular automaton rule based on the Moore neighborhood (8 neighbors) sum modulo 2. The execution results clearly show this rule is incorrect, as it failed to reproduce the expected output for any of the training examples, including the one it was originally based on. The transformed outputs differ significantly from the expected outputs in terms of the pattern and the count of azure pixels.\n\nThe strategy is to re-evaluate the relationship between the input and output across all examples to find a consistent rule. The output patterns strongly suggest a cellular automaton, possibly related to Rule 90 known for generating Sierpinski triangle patterns, but adapted for a 2D grid. The key is to identify the correct neighborhood and update rule. The number of iterations being `max(height, width)` seems plausible given the extent of the patterns in the outputs.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the `code_output`:\n| Metric                  | Example 1      | Example 2      | Example 3      |\n| :---------------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |\n| Input Shape             | (22, 22)       | (12, 12)       | (16, 16)       |\n| Output Shape            | (22, 22)       | (12, 12)       | (16, 16)       |\n| Input Azure Count       | 12             | 4              | 8              |\n| Expected Output Azure Count | 239            | 73             | 127            |\n| Transformed Output Azure Count (Old Code) | 182            | 33             | 20             |\n| Pixels Off (Old Code)   | 287            | 72             | 113            |\n\n**Observations from Metrics:**\n*   Grid dimensions are preserved.\n*   The number of azure (8) pixels increases substantially from input to output.\n*   The previous code failed to generate the correct patterns and counts.\n*   The rule needs to account for a significant 'growth' or spread of the azure color.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
