```python
import numpy as np

"""
Applies a 2D cellular automaton rule, similar to Rule 150, iteratively for a number of steps 
equal to the maximum of the grid's height and width.

1. Initialize the automaton state with the input grid, mapping azure (8) to 1 and white (0) to 0.
2. Determine the number of iterations N = max(height, width).
3. Pad the grid with a border of zeros (state 0) to simplify boundary checks.
4. Iterate N times:
   a. Create a new padded grid for the next state, initialized to all zeros (state 0).
   b. For each cell (r, c) corresponding to the original grid positions within the padded grid:
      i. Get the 3x3 neighborhood centered at (r, c) from the current padded grid. This includes the cell itself and its 8 neighbors (Moore neighborhood).
      ii. Calculate the sum of the states (0 or 1) of all 9 cells in the neighborhood.
      iii. If the sum is odd (sum % 2 == 1), set the cell (r, c) in the new padded grid to 1.
      iv. Otherwise, the cell (r, c) in the new padded grid remains 0.
   c. Update the current padded grid state to be the new padded grid state.
5. After N iterations, extract the central part of the padded grid corresponding to the original grid dimensions.
6. Convert the final grid state back to the original color scheme: change 1s back to azure (8) and keep 0s as white (0).
7. The resulting grid is the output.
