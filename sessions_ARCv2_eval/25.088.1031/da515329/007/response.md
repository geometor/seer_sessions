"""
Simulates a 2D cellular automaton rule based on the XOR sum of cardinal neighbors (similar to 2D Rule 90)
iteratively for a number of steps equal to the maximum of the grid's height and width.

1. Convert the input grid (azure=8, white=0) into a binary state grid (1 for azure, 0 for white).
2. Determine the number of iterations N = max(height, width).
3. Pad the binary state grid with a border of zeros (state 0) to handle boundary conditions during neighbor lookup.
4. Iterate N times:
   a. Create a new padded grid for the next state, initialized to all zeros (state 0).
   b. For each cell (r, c) corresponding to the original grid positions within the padded grid:
      i. Get the states of the four cardinal neighbors: North (r-1, c), South (r+1, c), East (r, c+1), West (r, c-1) from the current padded grid.
      ii. Calculate the XOR sum of these four neighbor states.
      iii. Set the cell (r, c) in the new padded grid to the calculated XOR sum (0 or 1).
   c. Update the current padded grid state to be the new padded grid state.
5. After N iterations, extract the central part of the padded grid corresponding to the original grid dimensions.
6. Convert the final binary state grid back to the original color scheme: change 1s back to azure (8) and keep 0s as white (0).
7. Return the resulting grid.
