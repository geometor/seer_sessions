task_elements:
  - name: input_grid
    type: Grid
    description: A 2D array of single digits (represented as list of lists of ints).
    properties:
      - rows: Integer (variable, e.g., 16 in examples)
      - columns: Integer (variable, e.g., 16 in examples)
      - cell_values: Digits (0-9)
      - contains_background_digit: Boolean
      - contains_foreground_digits: Boolean

  - name: background_digit
    type: Digit
    description: The most frequent digit in the input grid.
    determination_method: Find the digit with the maximum count in the flattened input grid.
    example_values:
      - train_1: 8
      - train_2: 1

  - name: foreground_digit
    type: Digit
    description: Any digit in the input grid that is not the background digit.
    properties:
      - value: Digit (0-9, excluding the background_digit)
      - position: Tuple (row_index, column_index)

  - name: output_column_string
    type: String
    description: >
      A single string representing a column of digits. This string contains all
      foreground digits from the input grid, ordered by their row-major scan
      position (top-to-bottom, left-to-right). Each digit is presented on its
      own line, separated by newline characters (`\n`). This is explicitly NOT a grid format.
    properties:
      - content: Sequence of foreground digits.
      - format: A single string with digits separated by newline characters (`\n`).

relationships:
  - type: Identification
    description: The background digit is identified based on frequency within the input grid.
    source: input_grid
    target: background_digit

  - type: Extraction & Filtering
    description: Digits are extracted from the input grid if they are not the background digit.
    source: input_grid
    condition: cell_value != background_digit
    result: A sequence of foreground digits.

  - type: Ordering
    description: The extracted foreground digits are ordered based on their original position in the input grid using a row-major scan (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
    applies_to: The sequence of foreground digits.

  - type: Formatting
    description: The ordered sequence of foreground digits is formatted into a single string, with each digit followed by a newline character.
    input: Ordered list of foreground digits.
    output: output_column_string

actions:
  - name: determine_background
    input: input_grid
    output: background_digit
    steps:
      - Flatten the grid into a single list of all digits.
      - Count the frequency of each unique digit.
      - Return the digit with the highest frequency.

  - name: generate_output_string
    input:
      - input_grid
      - background_digit
    output: output_column_string
    steps:
      - Initialize an empty list to store foreground digits.
      - Iterate through grid rows from top to bottom.
      - Within each row, iterate through cells from left to right.
      - If the current cell's digit is not the background_digit, append it to the list.
      - Convert each digit in the list to its string representation.
      - Join the list of stringified digits using a newline character (`\n`) as the separator.
      - Return the resulting single string. If no foreground digits were found, return an empty string.
