"""
Transforms an input grid based on the arrangement of '6' separators.

The transformation operates in one of two modes: 'split' or 'extract'.

1.  **Identify Separators:** Find all complete rows and columns consisting only of the digit 6.

2.  **Determine Mode:**
    *   **Split Mode:** Activated if separators perfectly partition the grid into rectangular subgrids (typically 5x5 in examples), each containing a single non-background pattern.
        *   If partitioning is done by HORIZONTAL separators (like train_2): The subgrids are extracted, ordered from BOTTOM to TOP, and arranged HORIZONTALLY in the output, separated by VERTICAL lines of 6s.
        *   If partitioning is done by VERTICAL separators (like train_3): The subgrids are extracted, ordered from LEFT to RIGHT, and arranged VERTICALLY in the output, separated by HORIZONTAL lines of 6s.
    *   **Extract Mode:** Activated if the grid isn't perfectly partitioned by separators (e.g., a single separator line exists like train_1).
        *   Identify connected regions of digits other than 6 (separator) and 7 (background).
        *   For each region, create a 5x5 'panel' initialized with 7s.
        *   Copy the pattern from the region's bounding box into the top-left of its panel.
        *   Determine the region's position relative to the main separator (e.g., Above/Below, Left/Right).
        *   Order the panels based on a specific positional sequence (derived from train_1: Top-Right, Bottom-Right, Top-Left, Bottom-Left - corresponding to digits 4, 3, 2, 1 in that example). Note: The digit values (1,2,3,4) themselves are patterns, not positional indices. The order is derived from observing train_1's input/output mapping. Let's refine this: the order seems to be Top-Left, Bottom-Right, Top-Right, Bottom-Left relative to the separator. Re-checking train_1 output: Panel1(2), Panel2(3), Panel3(4), Panel4(1). Original positions: 2(Top-Left), 3(Bottom-Right), 4(Top-Right), 1(Bottom-Left). So the output order is Top-Left, Bottom-Right, Top-Right, Bottom-Left.
        *   Arrange the ordered panels VERTICALLY, separated by HORIZONTAL lines of 6s.

3.  **Construct Output:** Assemble the subgrids or panels with their respective separators according to the determined mode and ordering.
