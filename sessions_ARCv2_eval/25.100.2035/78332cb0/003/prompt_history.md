Okay, let's break down the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grids:** The inputs and outputs are numerical grids.
2.  **Numbers/Colors:** The grids use digits, likely representing different colors or object types. '7' appears to be a background color. '6' acts as a separator element. Digits like '1', '2', '3', '4', '8', '9' represent distinct patterns or objects embedded within the background.
3.  **Separators (6s):** Lines composed entirely of '6's appear either horizontally (spanning the grid width) or vertically (spanning the grid height). These lines function to divide the grid or delineate sections.
4.  **Pattern Regions:** Connected areas of digits other than '6' or '7' form distinct regions or patterns.
5.  **Subgrids/Panels:** The transformation involves either splitting the main grid into subgrids based on separators or extracting pattern regions into standardized panels (like 5x5).
6.  **Orientation & Arrangement:** The transformation changes the orientation and arrangement of these patterns/subgrids. Sometimes they are stacked vertically, sometimes arranged horizontally. The separators ('6's) are also used in the output, potentially changing orientation (horizontal input separators leading to vertical output separators, and vice versa).
7.  **Ordering:** The order in which patterns/subgrids appear in the output depends on their original position in the input and the type of separation (horizontal vs. vertical).

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task_description: Reorganize pattern blocks extracted from an input grid, using '6' as a separator and '7' as background. The reorganization method (splitting vs. extracting) and output arrangement (horizontal/vertical stacking, ordering) depend on the configuration of the '6' separators in the input.

      Otherwise, assume Mode 'extract' (like train_1). In train_1, the separator is horizontal.

    output: output_grid
    description: >

      If input separators were horizontal (split mode) or if mode was extract: arrange items HORIZONTALLY/VERTICALLY?? -> Recheck logic.
      - If Mode 'split' with HORIZONTAL separators: Arrange subgrids HORIZONTALLY in REVERSE order, separated by VERTICAL 6s lines.
      - If Mode 'split' with VERTICAL separators: Arrange subgrids VERTICALLY in ORIGINAL order, separated by HORIZONTAL 6s lines.
      - If Mode 'extract' (like train_1, horizontal separator): Arrange panels VERTICALLY in relative_position order (AL, BR, AR, BL), separated by HORIZONTAL 6s lines.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Separators:** Scan the input grid to find all complete horizontal rows and complete vertical columns consisting solely of the digit '6'.
2.  **Determine Operating Mode:**
    *   **Check for Grid Split Mode:** If the identified '6' separators perfectly divide the input grid into distinct rectangular subgrids such that each subgrid contains exactly one connected region of pattern digits (non-'6', non-'7'), then activate "Grid Split Mode". Note whether the partitioning separators were horizontal or vertical.
    *   **Default to Region Extract Mode:** If Grid Split Mode does not apply (e.g., only one separator line exists, or multiple pattern regions exist within the areas defined by separators), activate "Region Extract Mode". Assume the primary separator is the single horizontal line of '6's if present (as in train_1).
3.  **Process Based on Mode:**
    *   **If Grid Split Mode:**
        *   Remove the separator lines to get a list of subgrids.
        *   If the original separators were **horizontal**: Arrange the subgrids **horizontally** in the output. Order them based on their original vertical position, starting from the **bottom** subgrid and moving upwards (reverse order). Separate adjacent subgrids in the output with a single **vertical** column of '6's.
        *   If the original separators were **vertical**: Arrange the subgrids **vertically** in the output. Order them based on their original horizontal position, starting from the **leftmost** subgrid and moving rightwards (original order). Separate adjacent subgrids in the output with a single **horizontal** row of '6's.
    *   **If Region Extract Mode (based on train_1):**
        *   Identify all connected regions of pattern digits (not '6' or '7').
        *   For each region, determine its bounding box.
        *   Create a 5x5 output panel for each region, filled initially with the background digit '7'. Copy the pattern from the region's bounding box into this 5x5 panel (preserving its internal structure, specific alignment within the 5x5 needs careful implementation, potentially based on examples).
        *   Determine the position of each region relative to the primary horizontal separator line (e.g., Above/Below) and its horizontal position (e.g., Left/Right relative to the grid's center or start

Transforms an input grid based on the arrangement of '6' separators.

The transformation operates in one of two modes: 'split' or 'extract'.

1.  **Identify Separators:** Find all complete rows and columns consisting only of the digit 6.

2.  **Determine Mode:**
    *   **Split Mode:** Activated if separators perfectly partition the grid into rectangular subgrids (typically 5x5 in examples), each containing a single non-background pattern.
        *   If partitioning is done by HORIZONTAL separators (like train_2): The subgrids are extracted, ordered from BOTTOM to TOP, and arranged HORIZONTALLY in the output, separated by VERTICAL lines of 6s.
        *   If partitioning is done by VERTICAL separators (like train_3): The subgrids are extracted, ordered from LEFT to RIGHT, and arranged VERTICALLY in the output, separated by HORIZONTAL lines of 6s.
    *   **Extract Mode:** Activated if the grid isn't perfectly partitioned by separators (e.g., a single separator line exists like train_1).
        *   Identify connected regions of digits other than 6 (separator) and 7 (background).
        *   For each region, create a 5x5 'panel' initialized with 7s.
        *   Copy the pattern from the region's bounding box into the top-left of its panel.
        *   Determine the region's position relative to the main separator (e.g., Above/Below, Left/Right).
        *   Order the panels based on a specific positional sequence (derived from train_1: Top-Right, Bottom-Right, Top-Left, Bottom-Left - corresponding to digits 4, 3, 2, 1 in that example). Note: The digit values (1,2,3,4) themselves are patterns, not positional indices. The order is derived from observing train_1's input/output mapping. Let's refine this: the order seems to be Top-Left, Bottom-Right, Top-Right, Bottom-Left relative to the separator. Re-checking train_1 output: Panel1(2), Panel2(3), Panel3(4), Panel4(1). Original positions: 2(Top-Left), 3(Bottom-Right), 4(Top-Right), 1(Bottom-Left). So the output order is Top-Left, Bottom-Right, Top-Right, Bottom-Left.
        *   Arrange the ordered panels VERTICALLY, separated by HORIZONTAL lines of 6s.

3.  **Construct Output:** Assemble the subgrids or panels with their respective separators according to the determined mode and ordering.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code correctly identified and implemented the logic for examples `train_2` (split by horizontal separators) and `train_3` (split by vertical separators). However, it failed on `train_1` because the mode determination logic was too restrictive. Specifically, `train_1` has both a full horizontal separator and a full vertical separator, but these do not perfectly partition the grid in the same way as `train_2` or `train_3`. The code incorrectly skipped the 'Extract Region' mode intended for `train_1` because a vertical separator was present.

The strategy is to refine the mode determination logic:
1.  Check for 'Split Vertical' conditions first (only vertical separators, correct partitioning).
2.  Check for 'Split Horizontal' conditions next (only horizontal separators, more than one, correct partitioning).
3.  If neither split condition is met, default to 'Extract Region' mode. This mode should handle cases like `train_1` where separators exist but don't create a clean partition suitable for direct subgrid stacking/concatenation. The extraction should identify pattern regions, create standardized panels (5x5), and arrange them based on their original position relative to the primary (likely horizontal) separator.

## Metrics Analysis

Based on the `tool_code` execution:

*   **train_1:**
    *   Shape: (11, 11)
    *   Horizontal Separators: `[5]` (1 separator)
    *   Vertical Separators: `[5]` (1 separator)
    *   Patterns: 4
    *   Partitions Horizontally: False
    *   Partitions Vertically: False
    *   **Conclusion:** Does not fit split modes. Should use 'Extract Region' mode. The code failed because the presence of `v_separators` prevented selection of the intended 'Extract' logic path.
*   **train_2:**
    *   Shape: (17, 5)
    *   Horizontal Separators: `[5, 11]` (2 separators)
    *   Vertical Separators: `[]` (0 separators)
    *   Patterns: 3
    *   Partitions Horizontally: True (3 patterns * 5 rows/pattern + 2 separators = 17 rows)
    *   Partitions Vertically: False
    *   **Conclusion:** Fits 'Split Horizontal' mode. Code succeeded.
*   **train_3:**
    *   Shape: (5, 17)
    *   Horizontal Separators: `[]` (0 separators)
    *   Vertical Separators: `[5, 11]` (2 separators)
    *   Patterns: 3
    *   Partitions Horizontally: False
    *   Partitions Vertically: True (3 patterns * 5 cols/pattern + 2 separators = 17 cols)
    *   **Conclusion:** Fits 'Split Vertical' mode. Code succeeded.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Analyze Grid Structure:**
    *   Identify all complete horizontal rows composed only of '6's (horizontal separators).
    *   Identify all complete vertical columns composed only of '6's (vertical separators).
    *   Count the number of distinct connected pattern regions (pixels that are not '6' or '7').
2.  **Determine Transformation Mode:**
    *   **Mode 1: Split Vertical:** If *only* vertical separators exist AND they perfectly partition the grid columns into segments corresponding to the number of patterns (assuming a standard width like 5 per pattern, so `grid_cols == num_patterns * 5 + num_vertical_separators`), select this mode.
    *   **Mode 2: Split Horizontal:** Else if *only* horizontal separators exist AND there is more than one separator (`num_horizontal_separators > 1`) AND they perfectly partition the grid rows into segments corresponding to the number of patterns (assuming a standard height like 5 per pattern, so `grid_rows == num_patterns * 5 + num_horizontal_separators`), select this mode.
    *   **Mode 3: Extract Region:** Otherwise (e.g., if both types of separators exist, or only one horizontal separator exists, or separators don't perfectly partition the grid based on the checks above), select this mode. If a horizontal separator exists, note its row index as the primary separator reference.
3.  **Execute Transformation:**
    *   **If Mode 1 (Split Vertical):**
        *   Extract the subgrids located between the vertical separators (and grid edges).
        *   Arrange these subgrids vertically in the output, maintaining their original left-to-right order.
        *   Insert a single horizontal row of '6's between each adjacent subgrid.
    *   **If Mode 2 (Split Horizontal):**
        *   Extract the subgrids located between the horizontal separators (and grid edges).
        *   Reverse the order of these subgrids (process from bottom to top of the original grid).
        *   Arrange these reversed subgrids horizontally in the output.
        *   Insert a single vertical column of '6's between each adjacent subgrid.
    *   **If Mode 3 (Extract Region):**
        *   Find the bounding box for each distinct pattern region.
        *   For each region, create a 5x5 panel initially filled with '7's. Copy the content of the pattern's bounding box into the top-left corner of its panel.
        *   Determine the position of each pattern region relative to the primary horizontal separator (Above/Below) and the grid's vertical centerline (Left/Right). Assign labels: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), Bottom-Right (BR).
        *   Order the created panels according to the sequence: TL, BR, TR, BL.
        *   Arrange these ordered panels vertically in the output.
        *   Insert a single horizontal row of '6's between each adjacent panel.
4.  **Final Output:** Return the constructed grid.
