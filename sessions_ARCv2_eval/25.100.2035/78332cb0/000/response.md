Okay, let's break down the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grids:** The inputs and outputs are numerical grids.
2.  **Numbers/Colors:** The grids use digits, likely representing different colors or object types. '7' appears to be a background color. '6' acts as a separator element. Digits like '1', '2', '3', '4', '8', '9' represent distinct patterns or objects embedded within the background.
3.  **Separators (6s):** Lines composed entirely of '6's appear either horizontally (spanning the grid width) or vertically (spanning the grid height). These lines function to divide the grid or delineate sections.
4.  **Pattern Regions:** Connected areas of digits other than '6' or '7' form distinct regions or patterns.
5.  **Subgrids/Panels:** The transformation involves either splitting the main grid into subgrids based on separators or extracting pattern regions into standardized panels (like 5x5).
6.  **Orientation & Arrangement:** The transformation changes the orientation and arrangement of these patterns/subgrids. Sometimes they are stacked vertically, sometimes arranged horizontally. The separators ('6's) are also used in the output, potentially changing orientation (horizontal input separators leading to vertical output separators, and vice versa).
7.  **Ordering:** The order in which patterns/subgrids appear in the output depends on their original position in the input and the type of separation (horizontal vs. vertical).

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task_description: Reorganize pattern blocks extracted from an input grid, using '6' as a separator and '7' as background. The reorganization method (splitting vs. extracting) and output arrangement (horizontal/vertical stacking, ordering) depend on the configuration of the '6' separators in the input.

elements:
  - id: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers.
  - id: background_digit
    value: 7
    description: Represents empty space or background.
  - id: separator_digit
    value: 6
    description: Used to form lines that separate regions or subgrids.
  - id: pattern_digits
    value: [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9] # Digits observed in patterns
    description: Digits representing the core patterns/objects.
  - id: separator_line
    description: A horizontal or vertical line composed entirely of separator_digits (6).
  - id: pattern_region
    description: A connected component of pattern_digits within the grid, not crossing separator_lines.
  - id: subgrid
    description: A rectangular section of the input grid obtained by splitting along separator_lines.
  - id: panel
    description: A standardized grid (e.g., 5x5) used in the output to display an extracted pattern_region, padded with background_digit (7).

relationships_and_actions:
  - action: identify_separators
    input: grid
    output: list of horizontal_separator_lines, list of vertical_separator_lines
    description: Locates complete rows or columns filled only with the separator_digit (6).
  - action: determine_mode
    input: grid, separator_lines
    output: mode ('split' or 'extract'), separator_type ('horizontal' or 'vertical')
    description: >
      Checks if separators fully partition the grid into rectangular blocks each containing one pattern (Mode 'split').
      If horizontal separators partition -> separator_type = 'horizontal'.
      If vertical separators partition -> separator_type = 'vertical'.
      Otherwise, assume Mode 'extract' (like train_1). In train_1, the separator is horizontal.
  - action: split_grid
    condition: mode == 'split'
    input: grid, separator_lines, separator_type
    output: list of subgrids, order ('original' or 'reverse')
    description: >
      Splits the grid along the separators.
      If separator_type is 'horizontal', order is 'reverse' (bottom-to-top).
      If separator_type is 'vertical', order is 'original' (left-to-right).
  - action: extract_regions
    condition: mode == 'extract'
    input: grid
    output: list of panels, order ('relative_position')
    description: >
      Finds connected pattern_regions. Creates a 5x5 panel for each, placing the pattern inside padded with background_digit (7).
      Determines order based on region position relative to the main separator (e.g., Above-Left, Below-Right, Above-Right, Below-Left for a horizontal separator).
  - action: construct_output
    input: subgrids or panels, order, separator_type (from mode determination)
    output: output_grid
    description: >
      Arranges the subgrids/panels according to the determined order.
      If input separators were horizontal (split mode) or if mode was extract: arrange items HORIZONTALLY/VERTICALLY?? -> Recheck logic.
      - If Mode 'split' with HORIZONTAL separators: Arrange subgrids HORIZONTALLY in REVERSE order, separated by VERTICAL 6s lines.
      - If Mode 'split' with VERTICAL separators: Arrange subgrids VERTICALLY in ORIGINAL order, separated by HORIZONTAL 6s lines.
      - If Mode 'extract' (like train_1, horizontal separator): Arrange panels VERTICALLY in relative_position order (AL, BR, AR, BL), separated by HORIZONTAL 6s lines.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Separators:** Scan the input grid to find all complete horizontal rows and complete vertical columns consisting solely of the digit '6'.
2.  **Determine Operating Mode:**
    *   **Check for Grid Split Mode:** If the identified '6' separators perfectly divide the input grid into distinct rectangular subgrids such that each subgrid contains exactly one connected region of pattern digits (non-'6', non-'7'), then activate "Grid Split Mode". Note whether the partitioning separators were horizontal or vertical.
    *   **Default to Region Extract Mode:** If Grid Split Mode does not apply (e.g., only one separator line exists, or multiple pattern regions exist within the areas defined by separators), activate "Region Extract Mode". Assume the primary separator is the single horizontal line of '6's if present (as in train_1).
3.  **Process Based on Mode:**
    *   **If Grid Split Mode:**
        *   Remove the separator lines to get a list of subgrids.
        *   If the original separators were **horizontal**: Arrange the subgrids **horizontally** in the output. Order them based on their original vertical position, starting from the **bottom** subgrid and moving upwards (reverse order). Separate adjacent subgrids in the output with a single **vertical** column of '6's.
        *   If the original separators were **vertical**: Arrange the subgrids **vertically** in the output. Order them based on their original horizontal position, starting from the **leftmost** subgrid and moving rightwards (original order). Separate adjacent subgrids in the output with a single **horizontal** row of '6's.
    *   **If Region Extract Mode (based on train_1):**
        *   Identify all connected regions of pattern digits (not '6' or '7').
        *   For each region, determine its bounding box.
        *   Create a 5x5 output panel for each region, filled initially with the background digit '7'. Copy the pattern from the region's bounding box into this 5x5 panel (preserving its internal structure, specific alignment within the 5x5 needs careful implementation, potentially based on examples).
        *   Determine the position of each region relative to the primary horizontal separator line (e.g., Above/Below) and its horizontal position (e.g., Left/Right relative to the grid's center or start
