## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code successfully implemented the logic for the 'split' modes (vertical separators in `train_3`, horizontal separators in `train_2`). However, it failed for `train_1`, indicating the logic for the 'extract' mode was incorrect.

The failure in `train_1` was in how the pattern regions were processed and placed into the output panels. The code attempted to find bounding boxes and place them into the top-left of a 5x5 panel, which did not replicate the desired output structure.

**Revised Strategy:**
Re-evaluating `train_1`'s input and output reveals a different pattern for this mode. The input grid is 11x11 with central horizontal and vertical separators (at index 5). The output consists of four 5x5 panels stacked vertically. These panels correspond exactly to the four 5x5 quadrants defined by the separators in the input grid.
The transformation for this specific case appears to be:
1.  Identify the central horizontal and vertical separators.
2.  Extract the four 5x5 quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), Bottom-Right (BR).
3.  Stack these quadrants vertically in the order: TL, BR, TR, BL.
4.  Insert a horizontal line of '6's between each stacked quadrant.

This "Quadrant Extraction" logic replaces the previous "Region Extract" logic. The mode determination needs to be updated to specifically identify this case (e.g., single H sep, single V sep, grid size appropriate for 5x5 quadrants like 11x11). The 'Split Vertical' and 'Split Horizontal' modes remain as previously defined.

## Metrics Analysis

We re-analyze the examples to confirm the applicability of the three modes:

    return [c for c in range(cols) if np.all(grid_np[:, c] == separator_digit)]

**Metrics Summary:**

*   **Example 1:** Shape (11, 11), H Sep: `[5]`, V Sep: `[5]`, Patterns: 4. Partitions H/V: False. Quadrant Conditions: True. **Deduced Mode: Extract Quadrant**.
*   **Example 2:** Shape (17, 5), H Sep: `[5, 11]`, V Sep: `[]`, Patterns: 3. Partitions H: True, Partitions V: False. Quadrant Conditions: False. **Deduced Mode: Split Horizontal**.
*   **Example 3:** Shape (5, 17), H Sep: `[]`, V Sep: `[5, 11]`, Patterns: 3. Partitions H: False, Partitions V: True. Quadrant Conditions: False. **Deduced Mode: Split Vertical**.

The metrics confirm the suitability of the three distinct modes based on the separator configuration and grid partitioning/shape. The new 'Extract Quadrant' mode correctly identifies Example 1.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Analyze Grid Structure:**
    *   Convert the input list of lists into a NumPy array.
    *   Find the row indices of all complete horizontal lines of '6's (H-separators).
    *   Find the column indices of all complete vertical lines of '6's (V-separators).
    *   Count the number of distinct connected regions of digits that are *not* '6' or '7' (pattern count).
2.  **Determine Transformation Mode:**
    *   **Check for Split Vertical:** Does the grid have *only* V-separators? If yes, do these separators perfectly partition the grid width based on the pattern count (assuming 5 units width per pattern, i.e., `grid_cols == num_patterns * 5 + num_V_separators`)? If both are true, select **Mode: Split Vertical**.
    *   **Check for Split Horizontal:** Else, does the grid have *only* H-separators, and *more than one* H-separator? If yes, do these separators perfectly partition the grid height based on the pattern count (assuming 5 units height per pattern, i.e., `grid_rows == num_patterns * 5 + num_H_separators`)? If all are true, select **Mode: Split Horizontal**.
    *   **Check for Extract Quadrant:** Else, does the grid have *exactly one* H-separator and *exactly one* V-separator? Is the pattern count a perfect square (e.g., 4)? Do the grid dimensions match the expected size for 5x5 quadrants based on the pattern count (i.e., `rows == cols == sqrt(num_patterns) * 5 + 1`)? If all are true, select **Mode: Extract Quadrant**.
    *   **Fallback:** If none of the above modes apply, the transformation is undefined for this input.
3.  **Execute Transformation:**
    *   **If Mode is Split Vertical:**
        *   Extract the subgrids located between the V-separators (and grid edges).
        *   Arrange these subgrids vertically in the output, maintaining their original left-to-right order.
        *   Insert a single horizontal row of '6's (matching subgrid width) between each adjacent subgrid.
    *   **If Mode is Split Horizontal:**
        *   Extract the subgrids located between the H-separators (and grid edges).
        *   Reverse the order of these subgrids (process from bottom to top of the original grid).
        *   Arrange these reversed subgrids horizontally in the output.
        *   Insert a single vertical column of '6's (matching subgrid height) between each adjacent subgrid.
    *   **If Mode is Extract Quadrant:**
        *   Identify the single H-separator index (`h_idx`) and V-separator index (`v_idx`).
        *   Extract the four 5x5 quadrants:
            *   Top-Left (TL): `grid[0:h_idx, 0:v_idx]`
            *   Top-Right (TR): `grid[0:h_idx, v_idx+1:end]`
            *   Bottom-Left (BL): `grid[h_idx+1:end, 0:v_idx]`
            *   Bottom-Right (BR): `grid[h_idx+1:end, v_idx+1:end]`
        *   Arrange these quadrants vertically in the specific order: TL, BR, TR, BL.
        *   Insert a single horizontal row of '6's (5 wide) between each adjacent quadrant.
4.  **Final Output:** Convert the resulting NumPy array into a list of lists. If the transformation mode was undefined or failed, return an empty list.
