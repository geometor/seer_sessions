## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code correctly identified and implemented the logic for examples `train_2` (split by horizontal separators) and `train_3` (split by vertical separators). However, it failed on `train_1` because the mode determination logic was too restrictive. Specifically, `train_1` has both a full horizontal separator and a full vertical separator, but these do not perfectly partition the grid in the same way as `train_2` or `train_3`. The code incorrectly skipped the 'Extract Region' mode intended for `train_1` because a vertical separator was present.

The strategy is to refine the mode determination logic:
1.  Check for 'Split Vertical' conditions first (only vertical separators, correct partitioning).
2.  Check for 'Split Horizontal' conditions next (only horizontal separators, more than one, correct partitioning).
3.  If neither split condition is met, default to 'Extract Region' mode. This mode should handle cases like `train_1` where separators exist but don't create a clean partition suitable for direct subgrid stacking/concatenation. The extraction should identify pattern regions, create standardized panels (5x5), and arrange them based on their original position relative to the primary (likely horizontal) separator.

## Metrics Analysis

Based on the `tool_code` execution:

*   **train_1:**
    *   Shape: (11, 11)
    *   Horizontal Separators: `[5]` (1 separator)
    *   Vertical Separators: `[5]` (1 separator)
    *   Patterns: 4
    *   Partitions Horizontally: False
    *   Partitions Vertically: False
    *   **Conclusion:** Does not fit split modes. Should use 'Extract Region' mode. The code failed because the presence of `v_separators` prevented selection of the intended 'Extract' logic path.
*   **train_2:**
    *   Shape: (17, 5)
    *   Horizontal Separators: `[5, 11]` (2 separators)
    *   Vertical Separators: `[]` (0 separators)
    *   Patterns: 3
    *   Partitions Horizontally: True (3 patterns * 5 rows/pattern + 2 separators = 17 rows)
    *   Partitions Vertically: False
    *   **Conclusion:** Fits 'Split Horizontal' mode. Code succeeded.
*   **train_3:**
    *   Shape: (5, 17)
    *   Horizontal Separators: `[]` (0 separators)
    *   Vertical Separators: `[5, 11]` (2 separators)
    *   Patterns: 3
    *   Partitions Horizontally: False
    *   Partitions Vertically: True (3 patterns * 5 cols/pattern + 2 separators = 17 cols)
    *   **Conclusion:** Fits 'Split Vertical' mode. Code succeeded.

## YAML Facts

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Analyze Grid Structure:**
    *   Identify all complete horizontal rows composed only of '6's (horizontal separators).
    *   Identify all complete vertical columns composed only of '6's (vertical separators).
    *   Count the number of distinct connected pattern regions (pixels that are not '6' or '7').
2.  **Determine Transformation Mode:**
    *   **Mode 1: Split Vertical:** If *only* vertical separators exist AND they perfectly partition the grid columns into segments corresponding to the number of patterns (assuming a standard width like 5 per pattern, so `grid_cols == num_patterns * 5 + num_vertical_separators`), select this mode.
    *   **Mode 2: Split Horizontal:** Else if *only* horizontal separators exist AND there is more than one separator (`num_horizontal_separators > 1`) AND they perfectly partition the grid rows into segments corresponding to the number of patterns (assuming a standard height like 5 per pattern, so `grid_rows == num_patterns * 5 + num_horizontal_separators`), select this mode.
    *   **Mode 3: Extract Region:** Otherwise (e.g., if both types of separators exist, or only one horizontal separator exists, or separators don't perfectly partition the grid based on the checks above), select this mode. If a horizontal separator exists, note its row index as the primary separator reference.
3.  **Execute Transformation:**
    *   **If Mode 1 (Split Vertical):**
        *   Extract the subgrids located between the vertical separators (and grid edges).
        *   Arrange these subgrids vertically in the output, maintaining their original left-to-right order.
        *   Insert a single horizontal row of '6's between each adjacent subgrid.
    *   **If Mode 2 (Split Horizontal):**
        *   Extract the subgrids located between the horizontal separators (and grid edges).
        *   Reverse the order of these subgrids (process from bottom to top of the original grid).
        *   Arrange these reversed subgrids horizontally in the output.
        *   Insert a single vertical column of '6's between each adjacent subgrid.
    *   **If Mode 3 (Extract Region):**
        *   Find the bounding box for each distinct pattern region.
        *   For each region, create a 5x5 panel initially filled with '7's. Copy the content of the pattern's bounding box into the top-left corner of its panel.
        *   Determine the position of each pattern region relative to the primary horizontal separator (Above/Below) and the grid's vertical centerline (Left/Right). Assign labels: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), Bottom-Right (BR).
        *   Order the created panels according to the sequence: TL, BR, TR, BL.
        *   Arrange these ordered panels vertically in the output.
        *   Insert a single horizontal row of '6's between each adjacent panel.
4.  **Final Output:** Return the constructed grid.
