            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code correctly identified and implemented the logic for examples `train_2` (split by horizontal separators) and `train_3` (split by vertical separators). However, it failed on `train_1` because the mode determination logic was too restrictive. Specifically, `train_1` has both a full horizontal separator and a full vertical separator, but these do not perfectly partition the grid in the same way as `train_2` or `train_3`. The code incorrectly skipped the 'Extract Region' mode intended for `train_1` because a vertical separator was present.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the mode determination logic:\n1.  Check for 'Split Vertical' conditions first (only vertical separators, correct partitioning).\n2.  Check for 'Split Horizontal' conditions next (only horizontal separators, more than one, correct partitioning).\n3.  If neither split condition is met, default to 'Extract Region' mode. This mode should handle cases like `train_1` where separators exist but don't create a clean partition suitable for direct subgrid stacking/concatenation. The extraction should identify pattern regions, create standardized panels (5x5), and arrange them based on their original position relative to the primary (likely horizontal) separator.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nBased on the `tool_code` execution:\n\n*   **train_1:**\n    *   Shape: (11, 11)\n    *   Horizontal Separators: `[5]` (1 separator)\n    *   Vertical Separators: `[5]` (1 separator)\n    *   Patterns: 4\n    *   Partitions Horizontally: False\n    *   Partitions Vertically: False\n    *   **Conclusion:** Does not fit split modes. Should use 'Extract Region' mode. The code failed because the presence of `v_separators` prevented selection of the intended 'Extract' logic path.\n*   **train_2:**\n    *   Shape: (17, 5)\n    *   Horizontal Separators: `[5, 11]` (2 separators)\n    *   Vertical Separators: `[]` (0 separators)\n    *   Patterns: 3\n    *   Partitions Horizontally: True (3 patterns * 5 rows/pattern + 2 separators = 17 rows)\n    *   Partitions Vertically: False\n    *   **Conclusion:** Fits 'Split Horizontal' mode. Code succeeded.\n*   **train_3:**\n    *   Shape: (5, 17)\n    *   Horizontal Separators: `[]` (0 separators)\n    *   Vertical Separators: `[5, 11]` (2 separators)\n    *   Patterns: 3\n    *   Partitions Horizontally: False\n    *   Partitions Vertically: True (3 patterns * 5 cols/pattern + 2 separators = 17 cols)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Fits 'Split Vertical' mode. Code succeeded.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
