If a pixel is white (0) and its immediate left neighbor (column c-1) and immediate right neighbor (column c+1) in the original input row are both non-white, change this pixel to blue (1) in the output grid.\n3.  **Conditional Clear:** After the filling step, check the colors of the original boundary pixels at indices l and r. If both boundary pixels were maroon (9), iterate again through the pixels strictly between the boundaries (from column l+1 to r-1) in the *output* grid. If any pixel in this range is blue (1), change it back to white (0).\n4.  **Preservation"
