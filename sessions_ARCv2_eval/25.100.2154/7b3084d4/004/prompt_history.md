Okay, analyzing the first example pair.

## Initial Perception

The input is a large sparse grid (20x20) containing four distinct clusters of non-zero digits (3s, 4s, 7s/5s, 9s) on a background of zeros. The output is a smaller, dense grid (6x6) containing digits derived from the input clusters. The transformation appears to involve identifying the four input clusters, extracting a representative shape or section from each, potentially transforming (like rotating) one of them, arranging these sections into a 2x2 layout in the output grid, and then filling in gaps and adjusting values at the boundaries between the sections. Specifically, the 7/5 cluster seems rotated and placed top-left, the 9s top-right, the 4s bottom-left, and the 3s bottom-right. The final output grid seems to have interactions or overwrites happening at the internal boundaries of the 2x2 arrangement.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Objects**: Scan the input 20x20 grid to find the four distinct connected components (clusters) of non-zero digits. Identify them based on their primary digit: C1 (9s), C2 (7s/5s), C3 (4s), and C4 (3s).
2.  **Extract Subgrids**: For each identified cluster, determine its minimal bounding box. Extract the content within the top-left 3x3 area of this bounding box. Let these 3x3 grids be `Subgrid_C1`, `Subgrid_C2`, `Subgrid_C3`, `Subgrid_C4`.
3.  **Transform Subgrid C2**: Rotate `Subgrid_C2` (containing the 7s and 5) by 270 degrees clockwise. Let the result be `Rotated_Subgrid_C2`.
4.  **Assemble Output Grid**: Create a new 6x6 grid. Place the four 3x3 subgrids into the 6x6 grid as follows:
    *   `Rotated_Subgrid_C2` in the top-left quadrant (rows 0-2, cols 0-2).
    *   `Subgrid_C1` in the top-right quadrant (rows 0-2, cols 3-5).
    *   `Subgrid_C3` in the bottom-left quadrant (rows 3-5, cols 0-2).
    *   `Subgrid_C4` in the bottom-right quadrant (rows 3-5, cols 3-5).
5.  **Fill Zero Cells**: Create a temporary copy of the assembled 6x6 grid. Iterate through the 6x6 grid. If a cell `(r, c)` in the temporary copy contains a 0:
    *   Determine the quadrant: TL (0<=r<3, 0<=c<3), TR (0<=r<3, 3<=c<6), BL (3<=r<6, 0<=c<3), BR (3<=r<6, 3<=c<6).
    *   Assign a fill value based on the quadrant's original dominant digit (TL=7, TR=9, BL=4, BR=3). Update the cell `(r, c)` in the main 6x6 grid with this fill value.
6.  **Apply Specific Zero-Fill Overrides**: After the initial fill, specifically set:
    *   `grid[1, 2] = 9` (overriding the fill value based on TL quadrant).
    *   `grid[2, 1] = 4` (overriding the fill value based on TL quadrant).
7.  **Apply Boundary Overwrites**: Modify the values of specific cells located near the internal boundaries based on the values of their neighbors *after* the zero-filling and overrides:
    *   Set `grid[2, 4] = grid[3, 4]`.
    *   Set `grid[4, 3] = grid[4, 2]`.
    *   Set `grid[4, 4] = grid[4, 3]` (using the newly updated value of `grid[4, 3]`).
8.  **Final Output**: The resulting 6x6 grid is the final output.

## Refined Perception

The core task remains consistent: identify four distinct non-zero digit clusters in a large sparse input grid and assemble transformed versions of them into a smaller, dense output grid.

Key refinements based on `train_2`:

1.  **Output Size is Variable**: The output grid size is not fixed (6x6 in `train_1`, 10x10 in `train_2`). It's determined by the size of the subgrids extracted from the input clusters. Let the subgrid size be NxN; the output is 2N x 2N.
2.  **Subgrid Size Determination (N)**: N appears to be determined by the dimensions of the input clusters' bounding boxes. Specifically, N seems to be the *minimum* value among the *maximum* dimensions (height or width, whichever is larger) of the four bounding boxes. (For `train_1`: max dims 4, 3, 5, 4 -> min is 3, so N=3. For `train_2`: max dims 6, 5, 7, 7 -> min is 5, so N=5).
3.  **Subgrid Extraction**: The top-left NxN section of each cluster's minimal bounding box content is extracted.
4.  **Assembly and Rotation Logic**: The assembly pattern and rotation are conditional.
    *   Identify the four clusters and determine their bounding box centers. Assign roles: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), Bottom-Right (BR) based on these centers (lowest Y are Top, highest Y are Bottom; for pairs, lowest X is Left, highest X is Right).
    *   **Assembly Rule Trigger**: Check the minimum Y coordinate (top edge) of the bounding boxes for the TL-role cluster and the TR-role cluster.
        *   If `minY(TL_cluster) == minY(TR_cluster)`: Use **Assembly B**: Place TL-role cluster -> Output TR; TR-role cluster -> Output TL; BL-role cluster -> Output BL; BR-role cluster -> Output BR.
        *   If `minY(TL_cluster) != minY(TR_cluster)`: Use **Assembly A**: Place TL-role cluster -> Output TL; TR-role cluster -> Output TR; BL-role cluster -> Output BL; BR-role cluster -> Output BR.
    *   **Rotation Rule**: If using Assembly B, the subgrid from the TR-role cluster (which is placed in the TL Output quadrant) is rotated 270 degrees clockwise before placement. No rotation occurs if using Assembly A.
5.  **Filling**: After placing the (potentially rotated) NxN subgrids, any remaining 0s within each NxN quadrant of the output grid are filled with the dominant digit of the *source cluster* for that quadrant (based on the assembly rule).
6.  **Boundary Overrides**: Specific cells near the internal boundaries of the 2Nx2N grid are overwritten *after* filling. These overrides seem to depend on the dominant colors of adjacent source clusters and the subgrid size N. The rules seem consistent across both assembly types, referencing the original cluster roles (TL, TR, BL, BR) for dominant colors.

```

## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Clusters and Properties**:
    *   Scan the input grid to find the four connected components (clusters) of non-zero digits.
    *   For each cluster, determine its minimal bounding box (coords, height H, width W), its dominant digit (most frequent non-zero), and identify all digits present within it.
    *   Calculate the center coordinates (Y, X) of each bounding box.
2.  **Determine Subgrid Size N**:
    *   For each cluster, find `max(H, W)`.
    *   Set `N` to be the minimum value among these four maximum dimensions.
    *   Calculate `k = floor(N / 2)`.
3.  **Assign Cluster Roles**:
    *   Identify the two clusters with the smallest center Y coordinates (Top clusters) and the two with the largest center Y coordinates (Bottom clusters).
    *   Of the two Top clusters, the one with the smaller center X coordinate gets the **TL_Cluster** role, the other gets the **TR_Cluster** role.
    *   Of the two Bottom clusters, the one with the smaller center X coordinate gets the **BL_Cluster** role, the other gets the **BR_Cluster** role.
4.  **Select Assembly Rule and Rotation**:
    *   Get the minimum Y coordinate (top edge) of the bounding boxes for `TL_Cluster` and `TR_Cluster`.
    *   If `minY(TL_Cluster) == minY(TR_Cluster)`:
        *   Set `Assembly_Rule = B`.
        *   The cluster for the TL output quadrant is `TR_Cluster`. Apply `Rotation = True`.
        *   The cluster for the TR output quadrant is `TL_Cluster`.
    *   Else:
        *   Set `Assembly_Rule = A`.
        *   The cluster for the TL output quadrant is `TL_Cluster`. Apply `Rotation = False`.
        *   The cluster for the TR output quadrant is `TR_Cluster`.
    *   The cluster for the BL output quadrant is `BL_Cluster`.
    *   The cluster for the BR output quadrant is `BR_Cluster`.
5.  **Extract and Transform Subgrids**:
    *   For each of the four clusters (`TL_Cluster`, `TR_Cluster`, `BL_Cluster`, `BR_Cluster`), extract the content of the top-left NxN area of its bounding box into `Subgrid_TL`, `Subgrid_TR`, `Subgrid_BL`, `Subgrid_BR` respectively.
    *   If `Rotation` is `True`, rotate `Subgrid_TR` (the subgrid sourced from the TR-role cluster) by 270 degrees clockwise. Let the result be `Transformed_Subgrid_For_TL_Output`. Otherwise, `Transformed_Subgrid_For_TL_Output` is `Subgrid_TL`.
    *   Let `Subgrid_For_TR_Output` be `Subgrid_TL` if `Assembly_Rule == B`, otherwise it's `Subgrid_TR`.
    *   `Subgrid_For_BL_Output` is `Subgrid_BL`.
    *   `Subgrid_For_BR_Output` is `Subgrid_BR`.
6.  **Assemble Initial Output Grid**:
    *   Create a new 2N x 2N grid, initially filled with 0s or a placeholder.
    *   Place `Transformed_Subgrid_For_TL_Output` in the top-left quadrant (rows 0 to N-1, cols 0 to N-1).
    *   Place `Subgrid_For_TR_Output` in the top-right quadrant (rows 0 to N-1, cols N to 2N-1).
    *   Place `Subgrid_For_BL_Output` in the bottom-left quadrant (rows N to 2N-1, cols 0 to N-1).
    *   Place `Subgrid_For_BR_Output` in the bottom-right quadrant (rows N to 2N-1, cols N to 2N-1).
7.  **Fill Zeroes**:
    *   Create a copy of the assembled grid, let it be `OutputGrid`.
    *   Iterate through each quadrant of `OutputGrid`.
    *   Determine the source cluster for that quadrant (e.g., TL output quadrant sourced from `TR_Cluster` if Assembly B). Get the dominant digit of that source cluster.
    *   For every cell `(r, c)` within that quadrant in `OutputGrid` that still contains the initial placeholder/zero from the source subgrid, replace its value with the dominant digit of the source cluster.
8.  **Apply Boundary Overrides**: Modify `OutputGrid` based on the calculated N, k, and the dominant digits associated with the original cluster roles (`Dom(TL_Cluster)`, `Dom(TR_Cluster)`, `Dom(BL_Cluster)`, `Dom(BR_Cluster)`):
    *   Identify the cluster that was placed in the TL Output quadrant. Check if the original digit `5` was present anywhere in that source cluster's bounding box. If yes, set `OutputGrid[0, 0] = 5`.
    *   Set `OutputGrid[N-1, k] = Dom(BL_Cluster)`.
    *   Set `OutputGrid[k, N] = Dom(TL_Cluster)`.
    *   Set `OutputGrid[N-1, N+k] = Dom(BR_Cluster)`.
    *   Set `OutputGrid[N+k, 0] = Dom(BL_Cluster)`.
    *   Set `OutputGrid[N+k, 1] = Dom(BL_Cluster)`.
    *   If `N >= 5`, set `OutputGrid[N-2, N+k] = Dom(BR_Cluster)`.
9.  **Final Output**: The modified `OutputGrid` is the final result.

## Refined Perception

My understanding of the core task remains: identify four non-zero digit clusters in a sparse input grid, determine a subgrid size `N`, extract NxN subgrids from the top-left of each cluster's bounding box, potentially swap and rotate the top two based on their vertical alignment, assemble these into a 2N x 2N output grid, fill any remaining zeroes based on the source quadrant's dominant digit, and then apply modifications, particularly near the internal boundaries.

Example `train_3` confirms the N calculation (`min(max(H,W))`) and the Assembly Rule logic (Assembly A used as top clusters C1 and C2 had different `minY` values). It also required correcting my initial role assignment for the bottom two clusters based strictly on X-coordinates after separating Top/Bottom pairs. The cluster with digit 5 (now identified as the BR-role cluster C3) still results in `Output[0,0]=5`, confirming the hypothesis that this rule applies if *any* input cluster contains a 5.

However, `train_3` significantly challenges the previous hypothesis about the final modification step consisting of a few specific point overrides based on N, k, and dominant colors. The required changes between the filled grid and the target output in `train_3` are extensive and suggest a more complex interaction or rule, possibly involving replacing values near the N-1/N row/column boundary based on adjacent quadrant properties, or perhaps a different set of rules specific to smaller N values (like N=2). The simple point overrides derived from `train_1` (N=3) and `train_2` (N=5) do not generalize to `train_3` (N=2).

Therefore, the final step appears to be a "Boundary Interaction/Modification" step whose precise rules are not fully captured by the previous examples alone and might be conditional on N or involve a different mechanism than simple point overrides.

## Updated YAML Observations

```yaml
Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    Size: Variable (e.g., 20x20)
    Background_Digit: 0
    Foreground_Digits: Variable sets of 4 distinct digits, sometimes including 5.
  Objects:
    - Type: Cluster
      Quantity: 4
      Properties:
        - Digits: Mostly uniform, can contain other digits (e.g., 7s cluster containing a 5).
        - Bounding_Box: Minimal box containing non-zero digits (Coords, Height H, Width W).
        - Center: Calculated from Bounding_Box (Y, X).
        - Role: TL_Cluster, TR_Cluster, BL_Cluster, or BR_Cluster based on relative center coordinates (Top two clusters sorted by X; Bottom two clusters sorted by X).
        - Dominant_Digit: The most frequent non-zero digit in the cluster.
        - Contains_5: Boolean flag indicating if digit 5 is present in the cluster's bounding box.
Output_Grid:
  Properties:
    Size: Variable (2N x 2N).
    Digits: Combination of digits from input clusters.
    Structure: 2x2 composition of NxN subgrids.
  Subgrids:
    - Size: NxN
    - Source: Determined by Assembly Rule (A or B) applied to Input Cluster Roles.
    - Transformation: Potential 270-degree clockwise rotation applied to the subgrid placed in the TL Output quadrant, conditional on Assembly Rule B being used.
Transformation:
  Parameters:
    - N: Determined as min(max(H, W)) across the 4 input cluster bounding boxes.
  Actions:
    - Identification: Find 4 non-zero digit clusters and their bounding boxes, dominant digits, and check for presence of digit 5.
    - Role_Assignment:
        - Identify Top (lowest Y centers) and Bottom (highest Y centers) pairs.
        - Within Top pair, assign TL_Cluster (lower X), TR_Cluster (higher X).
        - Within Bottom pair, assign BL_Cluster (lower X), BR_Cluster (higher X).
    - Assembly_Rule_Selection:
        - Get minY (top edge) for TL_Cluster and TR_Cluster bounding boxes.
        - If minY(TL_Cluster) == minY(TR_Cluster), select Assembly B (TL->TR, TR->TL(rot270), BL->BL, BR->BR). Set Rotation=True.
        - Else, select Assembly A (TL->TL, TR->TR, BL->BL, BR->BR). Set Rotation=False.
    - Subgrid_Extraction: Extract top-left NxN content from each cluster's bounding box (`Subgrid_TL`, `Subgrid_TR`, `Subgrid_BL`, `Subgrid_BR` corresponding to the *role*).
    - Rotation: If Rotation=True, rotate `Subgrid_TR` 270 degrees clockwise. Let this be `Rotated_Subgrid_TR`.
    - Assembly:
        - Create 2N x 2N grid.
        - Determine source subgrid for each quadrant based on Assembly Rule (e.g., TL output gets `Rotated_Subgrid_TR` if Rule B, `Subgrid_TL` if Rule A).
        - Place the corresponding subgrids into the output grid.
    - Filling:
        - Iterate through the assembled 2N x 2N grid.
        - For any cell `(r, c)` containing the background digit (0) from the source subgrid:
            - Determine the output quadrant (TL, TR, BL, BR).
            - Determine the *original input cluster* that was the source for this quadrant based on the Assembly Rule.
            - Replace the 0 with the Dominant_Digit of that source cluster.
    - Boundary_Interaction/Modification:
        - Apply modifications to the filled grid, primarily affecting cells near the internal boundaries (row N-1, row N, col N-1, col N).
        - Specific Rule 1: If *any* input cluster Contains_5, set OutputGrid[0, 0] = 5.
        - Specific Rule 2 (Hypothesized): The values of cells along the boundary rows/columns (N-1, N) are potentially overwritten based on the dominant digits of adjacent quadrants. (The exact mechanism needs refinement, as simple point overrides or direct neighbor copies failed for N=2).
        - The final state observed in examples suggests significant interaction between adjacent quadrants' properties in this step.
```

## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Clusters and Properties**:
    *   Scan the input grid to find the four connected components (clusters) of non-zero digits.
    *   For each cluster, determine its minimal bounding box (coordinates, height H, width W), its dominant digit, and check if the digit `5` is present within its bounding box.
    *   Calculate the center coordinates (Y, X) of each bounding box.
2.  **Determine Subgrid Size N**:
    *   For each cluster, find its maximum dimension: `max(H, W)`.
    *   Set `N` to be the minimum value among these four maximum dimensions.
3.  **Assign Cluster Roles**:
    *   Identify the two clusters with the smallest center Y coordinates (Top clusters) and the two with the largest center Y coordinates (Bottom clusters).
    *   Of the two Top clusters, the one with the smaller center X coordinate gets the **TL_Cluster** role, the other gets the **TR_Cluster** role.
    *   Of the two Bottom clusters, the one with the smaller center X coordinate gets the **BL_Cluster** role, the other gets the **BR_Cluster** role. Record the dominant digit for each role: `D(TL)`, `D(TR)`, `D(BL)`, `D(BR)`.
4.  **Select Assembly Rule and Rotation**:
    *   Get the minimum Y coordinate (top edge) of the bounding boxes for `TL_Cluster` and `TR_Cluster`.
    *   If `minY(TL_Cluster) == minY(TR_Cluster)`:
        *   Use **Assembly Rule B**: Place TL_Cluster subgrid -> TR Output, TR_Cluster subgrid -> TL Output, BL_Cluster subgrid -> BL Output, BR_Cluster subgrid -> BR Output.
        *   Set `Rotation = True`.
    *   Else:
        *   Use **Assembly Rule A**: Place TL_Cluster subgrid -> TL Output, TR_Cluster subgrid -> TR Output, BL_Cluster subgrid -> BL Output, BR_Cluster subgrid -> BR Output.
        *   Set `Rotation = False`.
5.  **Extract and Transform Subgrids**:
    *   For each of the four role clusters (`TL_Cluster`, `TR_Cluster`, `BL_Cluster`, `BR_Cluster`), extract the content of the top-left NxN area of its bounding box into `Subgrid_TL`, `Subgrid_TR`, `Subgrid_BL`, `Subgrid_BR` respectively.
    *   If `Rotation` is `True`, rotate `Subgrid_TR` (the subgrid sourced from the TR-role cluster) by 270 degrees clockwise. Let the result be `Transformed_Subgrid_For_TL_Output`.
6.  **Assemble Initial Output Grid**:
    *   Create a new 2N x 2N grid, `OutputGrid`.
    *   Determine the source subgrid for each quadrant based on the Assembly Rule and Rotation status:
        *   TL Output Quadrant (rows 0..N-1, cols 0..N-1): Use `Transformed_Subgrid_For_TL_Output` if Rule B, else use `Subgrid_TL`.
        *   TR Output Quadrant (rows 0..N-1, cols N..2N-1): Use `Subgrid_TL` if Rule B, else use `Subgrid_TR`.
        *   BL Output Quadrant (rows N..2N-1, cols 0..N-1): Use `Subgrid_BL`.
        *   BR Output Quadrant (rows N..2N-1, cols N..2N-1): Use `Subgrid_BR`.
    *   Copy the determined subgrids into their respective quadrants in `OutputGrid`.
7.  **Fill Zeroes**:
    *   Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of `OutputGrid`.
    *   If `OutputGrid[r, c]` contains the background digit (0 that came from an input subgrid's 0):
        *   Determine which output quadrant `(r, c)` belongs to (TL, TR, BL, BR).
        *   Determine the original input cluster *role* (`TL_Cluster`, `TR_Cluster`, `BL_Cluster`, or `BR_Cluster`) that was the source for this quadrant according to the Assembly Rule.
        *   Replace the 0 at `OutputGrid[r, c]` with the dominant digit (`D(TL)`, `D(TR)`, `D(BL)`, or `D(BR)`) corresponding to that source cluster role.
8.  **Apply Boundary Interaction/Modification**:
    *   Modify the `OutputGrid` based on interactions, particularly near the internal boundaries (rows/cols N-1 and N).
    *   **Rule 1**: Check if the digit `5` was present in *any* of the original input clusters. If yes, set `OutputGrid[0, 0] = 5`.
    *   **Rule 2**: Apply further modifications, especially to cells along rows `N-1`, `N` and columns `N-1`, `N`. The exact modifications appear complex and may depend on the dominant digits of adjacent source quadrants (`D(TL)`, `D(TR)`, `D(BL)`, `D(BR)`), potentially involving overwriting boundary cells. (Note: The precise rules for this step require further investigation, as simple overrides derived from N=3 and N=5 did not generalize to N=2).
9.  **Final Output**: The modified `OutputGrid` is the final result.
```python
import collections
import math

"""
Transforms a sparse 20x20 input grid containing four distinct digit clusters into a smaller, dense output grid.

The transformation involves:
1.  Identifying the four non-zero digit clusters in the input grid.
2.  Calculating properties for each cluster: bounding box, dimensions (H, W), center, dominant digit, and presence of the digit 5.
3.  Determining the size 'N' for subgrids based on the minimum of the maximum dimensions (H or W) of the four clusters.
4.  Assigning roles (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) to the clusters based on their center coordinates.
5.  Selecting an assembly rule (A or B) based on the vertical alignment of the Top-Left and Top-Right role clusters. Rule B involves swapping the placement of the top two clusters and rotating the one originally in the Top-Right role (which ends up in the top-left output quadrant).
6.  Extracting the top-left NxN subgrid from each cluster's bounding box.
7.  Assembling a 2N x 2N output grid by placing the extracted (and potentially rotated) subgrids according to the selected assembly rule.
8.  Filling any zero cells within each quadrant of the assembled grid with the dominant digit of the cluster that *sourced* that quadrant.
9.  Applying specific modifications, including:
    - Setting the top-left cell (0,0) to 5 if any input cluster contained the digit 5.
    - Overwriting specific cells near the internal boundaries based on N and the dominant digits of the original role clusters. (Note: The exact boundary interaction rules derived from examples N=3 and N=5 might not perfectly generalize to all N, particularly N=2, suggesting a more complex underlying mechanism not fully captured yet).

        # This might involve copying from diagonal quadrants or a different rule set for small N.
