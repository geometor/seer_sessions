**INSTRUCTIONS**

Above is a *subsequent* example pair for the task. Your previous analysis (perception, facts, program) based on earlier examples is included in the history.

Review this new example pair and compare it with your previous understanding.

Respond with the following *updated* deliverables, integrating the knowledge from *all* examples seen so far (including this new one):

- Your *refined* perception of the elements of the task.
- An *updated* YAML block documenting facts, incorporating observations from this new example.
- An *updated* natural language program describing the transformation rule, modified as needed to be consistent with *all* examples provided up to this point.

Your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a conversation.
Focus on how this example confirms or contradicts your previous hypothesis and adjust accordingly.
