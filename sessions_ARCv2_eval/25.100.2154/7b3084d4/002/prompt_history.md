Okay, analyzing the first example pair.

## Initial Perception

The input is a large sparse grid (20x20) containing four distinct clusters of non-zero digits (3s, 4s, 7s/5s, 9s) on a background of zeros. The output is a smaller, dense grid (6x6) containing digits derived from the input clusters. The transformation appears to involve identifying the four input clusters, extracting a representative shape or section from each, potentially transforming (like rotating) one of them, arranging these sections into a 2x2 layout in the output grid, and then filling in gaps and adjusting values at the boundaries between the sections. Specifically, the 7/5 cluster seems rotated and placed top-left, the 9s top-right, the 4s bottom-left, and the 3s bottom-right. The final output grid seems to have interactions or overwrites happening at the internal boundaries of the 2x2 arrangement.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Objects**: Scan the input 20x20 grid to find the four distinct connected components (clusters) of non-zero digits. Identify them based on their primary digit: C1 (9s), C2 (7s/5s), C3 (4s), and C4 (3s).
2.  **Extract Subgrids**: For each identified cluster, determine its minimal bounding box. Extract the content within the top-left 3x3 area of this bounding box. Let these 3x3 grids be `Subgrid_C1`, `Subgrid_C2`, `Subgrid_C3`, `Subgrid_C4`.
3.  **Transform Subgrid C2**: Rotate `Subgrid_C2` (containing the 7s and 5) by 270 degrees clockwise. Let the result be `Rotated_Subgrid_C2`.
4.  **Assemble Output Grid**: Create a new 6x6 grid. Place the four 3x3 subgrids into the 6x6 grid as follows:
    *   `Rotated_Subgrid_C2` in the top-left quadrant (rows 0-2, cols 0-2).
    *   `Subgrid_C1` in the top-right quadrant (rows 0-2, cols 3-5).
    *   `Subgrid_C3` in the bottom-left quadrant (rows 3-5, cols 0-2).
    *   `Subgrid_C4` in the bottom-right quadrant (rows 3-5, cols 3-5).
5.  **Fill Zero Cells**: Create a temporary copy of the assembled 6x6 grid. Iterate through the 6x6 grid. If a cell `(r, c)` in the temporary copy contains a 0:
    *   Determine the quadrant: TL (0<=r<3, 0<=c<3), TR (0<=r<3, 3<=c<6), BL (3<=r<6, 0<=c<3), BR (3<=r<6, 3<=c<6).
    *   Assign a fill value based on the quadrant's original dominant digit (TL=7, TR=9, BL=4, BR=3). Update the cell `(r, c)` in the main 6x6 grid with this fill value.
6.  **Apply Specific Zero-Fill Overrides**: After the initial fill, specifically set:
    *   `grid[1, 2] = 9` (overriding the fill value based on TL quadrant).
    *   `grid[2, 1] = 4` (overriding the fill value based on TL quadrant).
7.  **Apply Boundary Overwrites**: Modify the values of specific cells located near the internal boundaries based on the values of their neighbors *after* the zero-filling and overrides:
    *   Set `grid[2, 4] = grid[3, 4]`.
    *   Set `grid[4, 3] = grid[4, 2]`.
    *   Set `grid[4, 4] = grid[4, 3]` (using the newly updated value of `grid[4, 3]`).
8.  **Final Output**: The resulting 6x6 grid is the final output.

## Refined Perception

The core task remains consistent: identify four distinct non-zero digit clusters in a large sparse input grid and assemble transformed versions of them into a smaller, dense output grid.

Key refinements based on `train_2`:

1.  **Output Size is Variable**: The output grid size is not fixed (6x6 in `train_1`, 10x10 in `train_2`). It's determined by the size of the subgrids extracted from the input clusters. Let the subgrid size be NxN; the output is 2N x 2N.
2.  **Subgrid Size Determination (N)**: N appears to be determined by the dimensions of the input clusters' bounding boxes. Specifically, N seems to be the *minimum* value among the *maximum* dimensions (height or width, whichever is larger) of the four bounding boxes. (For `train_1`: max dims 4, 3, 5, 4 -> min is 3, so N=3. For `train_2`: max dims 6, 5, 7, 7 -> min is 5, so N=5).
3.  **Subgrid Extraction**: The top-left NxN section of each cluster's minimal bounding box content is extracted.
4.  **Assembly and Rotation Logic**: The assembly pattern and rotation are conditional.
    *   Identify the four clusters and determine their bounding box centers. Assign roles: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), Bottom-Right (BR) based on these centers (lowest Y are Top, highest Y are Bottom; for pairs, lowest X is Left, highest X is Right).
    *   **Assembly Rule Trigger**: Check the minimum Y coordinate (top edge) of the bounding boxes for the TL-role cluster and the TR-role cluster.
        *   If `minY(TL_cluster) == minY(TR_cluster)`: Use **Assembly B**: Place TL-role cluster -> Output TR; TR-role cluster -> Output TL; BL-role cluster -> Output BL; BR-role cluster -> Output BR.
        *   If `minY(TL_cluster) != minY(TR_cluster)`: Use **Assembly A**: Place TL-role cluster -> Output TL; TR-role cluster -> Output TR; BL-role cluster -> Output BL; BR-role cluster -> Output BR.
    *   **Rotation Rule**: If using Assembly B, the subgrid from the TR-role cluster (which is placed in the TL Output quadrant) is rotated 270 degrees clockwise before placement. No rotation occurs if using Assembly A.
5.  **Filling**: After placing the (potentially rotated) NxN subgrids, any remaining 0s within each NxN quadrant of the output grid are filled with the dominant digit of the *source cluster* for that quadrant (based on the assembly rule).
6.  **Boundary Overrides**: Specific cells near the internal boundaries of the 2Nx2N grid are overwritten *after* filling. These overrides seem to depend on the dominant colors of adjacent source clusters and the subgrid size N. The rules seem consistent across both assembly types, referencing the original cluster roles (TL, TR, BL, BR) for dominant colors.

```

## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Clusters and Properties**:
    *   Scan the input grid to find the four connected components (clusters) of non-zero digits.
    *   For each cluster, determine its minimal bounding box (coords, height H, width W), its dominant digit (most frequent non-zero), and identify all digits present within it.
    *   Calculate the center coordinates (Y, X) of each bounding box.
2.  **Determine Subgrid Size N**:
    *   For each cluster, find `max(H, W)`.
    *   Set `N` to be the minimum value among these four maximum dimensions.
    *   Calculate `k = floor(N / 2)`.
3.  **Assign Cluster Roles**:
    *   Identify the two clusters with the smallest center Y coordinates (Top clusters) and the two with the largest center Y coordinates (Bottom clusters).
    *   Of the two Top clusters, the one with the smaller center X coordinate gets the **TL_Cluster** role, the other gets the **TR_Cluster** role.
    *   Of the two Bottom clusters, the one with the smaller center X coordinate gets the **BL_Cluster** role, the other gets the **BR_Cluster** role.
4.  **Select Assembly Rule and Rotation**:
    *   Get the minimum Y coordinate (top edge) of the bounding boxes for `TL_Cluster` and `TR_Cluster`.
    *   If `minY(TL_Cluster) == minY(TR_Cluster)`:
        *   Set `Assembly_Rule = B`.
        *   The cluster for the TL output quadrant is `TR_Cluster`. Apply `Rotation = True`.
        *   The cluster for the TR output quadrant is `TL_Cluster`.
    *   Else:
        *   Set `Assembly_Rule = A`.
        *   The cluster for the TL output quadrant is `TL_Cluster`. Apply `Rotation = False`.
        *   The cluster for the TR output quadrant is `TR_Cluster`.
    *   The cluster for the BL output quadrant is `BL_Cluster`.
    *   The cluster for the BR output quadrant is `BR_Cluster`.
5.  **Extract and Transform Subgrids**:
    *   For each of the four clusters (`TL_Cluster`, `TR_Cluster`, `BL_Cluster`, `BR_Cluster`), extract the content of the top-left NxN area of its bounding box into `Subgrid_TL`, `Subgrid_TR`, `Subgrid_BL`, `Subgrid_BR` respectively.
    *   If `Rotation` is `True`, rotate `Subgrid_TR` (the subgrid sourced from the TR-role cluster) by 270 degrees clockwise. Let the result be `Transformed_Subgrid_For_TL_Output`. Otherwise, `Transformed_Subgrid_For_TL_Output` is `Subgrid_TL`.
    *   Let `Subgrid_For_TR_Output` be `Subgrid_TL` if `Assembly_Rule == B`, otherwise it's `Subgrid_TR`.
    *   `Subgrid_For_BL_Output` is `Subgrid_BL`.
    *   `Subgrid_For_BR_Output` is `Subgrid_BR`.
6.  **Assemble Initial Output Grid**:
    *   Create a new 2N x 2N grid, initially filled with 0s or a placeholder.
    *   Place `Transformed_Subgrid_For_TL_Output` in the top-left quadrant (rows 0 to N-1, cols 0 to N-1).
    *   Place `Subgrid_For_TR_Output` in the top-right quadrant (rows 0 to N-1, cols N to 2N-1).
    *   Place `Subgrid_For_BL_Output` in the bottom-left quadrant (rows N to 2N-1, cols 0 to N-1).
    *   Place `Subgrid_For_BR_Output` in the bottom-right quadrant (rows N to 2N-1, cols N to 2N-1).
7.  **Fill Zeroes**:
    *   Create a copy of the assembled grid, let it be `OutputGrid`.
    *   Iterate through each quadrant of `OutputGrid`.
    *   Determine the source cluster for that quadrant (e.g., TL output quadrant sourced from `TR_Cluster` if Assembly B). Get the dominant digit of that source cluster.
    *   For every cell `(r, c)` within that quadrant in `OutputGrid` that still contains the initial placeholder/zero from the source subgrid, replace its value with the dominant digit of the source cluster.
8.  **Apply Boundary Overrides**: Modify `OutputGrid` based on the calculated N, k, and the dominant digits associated with the original cluster roles (`Dom(TL_Cluster)`, `Dom(TR_Cluster)`, `Dom(BL_Cluster)`, `Dom(BR_Cluster)`):
    *   Identify the cluster that was placed in the TL Output quadrant. Check if the original digit `5` was present anywhere in that source cluster's bounding box. If yes, set `OutputGrid[0, 0] = 5`.
    *   Set `OutputGrid[N-1, k] = Dom(BL_Cluster)`.
    *   Set `OutputGrid[k, N] = Dom(TL_Cluster)`.
    *   Set `OutputGrid[N-1, N+k] = Dom(BR_Cluster)`.
    *   Set `OutputGrid[N+k, 0] = Dom(BL_Cluster)`.
    *   Set `OutputGrid[N+k, 1] = Dom(BL_Cluster)`.
    *   If `N >= 5`, set `OutputGrid[N-2, N+k] = Dom(BR_Cluster)`.
9.  **Final Output**: The modified `OutputGrid` is the final result.
