            "text": "## Refined Perception\n\nThe core task remains consistent: identify four distinct non-zero digit clusters in a large sparse input grid and assemble transformed versions of them into a smaller, dense output grid.\n\nKey refinements based on `train_2`:\n\n1.  **Output Size is Variable**: The output grid size is not fixed (6x6 in `train_1`, 10x10 in `train_2`). It's determined by the size of the subgrids extracted from the input clusters. Let the subgrid size be NxN; the output is 2N x 2N.\n2.  **Subgrid Size Determination (N)**: N appears to be determined by the dimensions of the input clusters' bounding boxes. Specifically, N seems to be the *minimum* value among the *maximum* dimensions (height or width, whichever is larger) of the four bounding boxes. (For `train_1`: max dims 4, 3, 5, 4 -> min is 3, so N=3. For `train_2`: max dims 6, 5, 7, 7 -> min is 5, so N=5).\n3.  **Subgrid Extraction**: The top-left NxN section of each cluster's minimal bounding box content is extracted.\n4.  **Assembly and Rotation Logic**: The assembly pattern and rotation are conditional.\n    *   Identify the four clusters and determine their bounding box centers. Assign roles: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), Bottom-Right (BR) based on these centers (lowest Y are Top, highest Y are Bottom; for pairs, lowest X is Left, highest X is Right).\n    *   **Assembly Rule Trigger**: Check the minimum Y coordinate (top edge) of the bounding boxes for the TL-role cluster and the TR-role cluster.\n        *   If `minY(TL_cluster) == minY(TR_cluster)`: Use **Assembly B**: Place TL-role cluster -> Output TR; TR-role cluster -> Output TL; BL-role cluster -> Output BL; BR-role cluster -> Output BR.\n        *   If `minY(TL_cluster) != minY(TR_cluster)`: Use **Assembly A**: Place TL-role cluster -> Output TL; TR-role cluster -> Output TR; BL-role cluster -> Output BL; BR-role cluster -> Output BR.\n    *   **Rotation Rule**: If using Assembly B, the subgrid from the TR-role cluster (which is placed in the TL Output quadrant) is rotated 270 degrees clockwise before placement. No rotation occurs if using Assembly A.\n5.  **Filling**: After placing the (potentially rotated) NxN subgrids, any remaining 0s within each NxN quadrant of the output grid are filled with the dominant digit of the *source cluster* for that quadrant (based on the assembly rule).\n6.  **Boundary Overrides**: Specific cells near the internal boundaries of the 2Nx2N grid are overwritten *after* filling. These overrides seem to depend on the dominant colors of adjacent source clusters and the subgrid size N. The rules seem consistent across both assembly types, referencing the original cluster roles (TL, TR, BL, BR) for dominant colors.\n\n## Updated YAML Observations\n\n```yaml\nInput_Grid:\n  Properties:\n    Size: Variable (e.g., 20x20)\n    Background_Digit: 0\n    Foreground_Digits: Variable sets of 4 distinct digits (e.g., [3,4,5,7,9] or [2,3,5,6,7])\n  Objects:\n    - Type: Cluster\n      Quantity: 4\n      Properties:\n        - Digits: Mostly uniform, can contain other digits (e.g., 7s cluster containing a 5)\n        - Bounding_Box: Minimal box containing non-zero digits.\n        - Center: Calculated from Bounding_Box.\n        - Role: TL, TR, BL, or BR based on relative center coordinates.\n        - Dominant_Digit: The most frequent non-zero digit in the cluster.\nOutput_Grid:\n  Properties:\n    Size: Variable (2N x 2N, where N is derived from input cluster dimensions)\n    Digits: Combination of digits from input clusters.\n    Structure: 2x2 composition of NxN subgrids.\n  Subgrids:\n    - Size: NxN\n    - Source: Determined by Assembly Rule (A or B) applied to Input Cluster Roles.\n    - Transformation: Potential 270-degree clockwise rotation applied to the subgrid placed in the TL Output quadrant, conditional on Assembly Rule B being used.\nTransformation:\n  Parameters:\n    - N: Determined as min(max(H, W)) across the 4 input cluster bounding boxes.\n    - k: Calculated as floor(N / 2).\n  Actions:\n    - Identification: Find 4 non-zero digit clusters and their bounding boxes.\n    - Role_Assignment: Assign TL, TR, BL, BR roles based on bounding box centers.\n    - Assembly_Rule_Selection:\n        - If minY(TL_role_cluster) == minY(TR_role_cluster), select Assembly B (TL->TR, TR->TL(rot270), BL->BL, BR->BR).\n        - Else, select Assembly A (TL->TL, TR->TR, BL->BL, BR->BR).\n    - Subgrid_Extraction: Extract top-left NxN from each cluster's bounding box.\n    - Rotation: If Assembly B, rotate the TR-role cluster's subgrid 270 degrees clockwise.\n    - Assembly: Create 2N x 2N grid, placing extracted (and potentially rotated) subgrids according to the selected Assembly Rule.\n    - Filling: Fill any 0s in each output quadrant with the dominant digit of the corresponding source cluster.\n    - Overrides: Apply specific modifications to the filled grid based on N, k, and dominant digits of original role clusters:\n        - Check cluster placed in TL Output: If its source cluster contains 5, set Output[0, 0] = 5.\n        - Set Output[N-1, k] = Dom(BL_Cluster)\n        - Set Output[k, N] = Dom(TL_Cluster)\n        - Set Output[N-1, N+k] = Dom(BR_Cluster)\n        - Set Output[N+k, 0] = Dom(BL_Cluster)\n        - Set Output[N+k, 1] = Dom(BL_Cluster)\n        - If N >= 5: Set Output[N-2, N+k] = Dom(BR_Cluster) # May need further refinement\n```\n\n## Updated Natural Language Program\n\n1.  **Identify Clusters and Properties**:\n    *   Scan the input grid to find the four connected components (clusters) of non-zero digits.\n    *   For each cluster, determine its minimal bounding box (coords, height H, width W), its dominant digit (most frequent non-zero), and identify all digits present within it.\n    *   Calculate the center coordinates (Y, X) of each bounding box.\n2.  **Determine Subgrid Size N**:\n    *   For each cluster, find `max(H, W)`.\n    *   Set `N` to be the minimum value among these four maximum dimensions.\n    *   Calculate `k = floor(N / 2)`.\n3.  **Assign Cluster Roles**:\n    *   Identify the two clusters with the smallest center Y coordinates (Top clusters) and the two with the largest center Y coordinates (Bottom clusters).\n    *   Of the two Top clusters, the one with the smaller center X coordinate gets the **TL_Cluster** role, the other gets the **TR_Cluster** role.\n    *   Of the two Bottom clusters, the one with the smaller center X coordinate gets the **BL_Cluster** role, the other gets the **BR_Cluster** role.\n4.  **Select Assembly Rule and Rotation**:\n    *   Get the minimum Y coordinate (top edge) of the bounding boxes for `TL_Cluster` and `TR_Cluster`.\n    *   If `minY(TL_Cluster) == minY(TR_Cluster)`:\n        *   Set `Assembly_Rule = B`.\n        *   The cluster for the TL output quadrant is `TR_Cluster`. Apply `Rotation = True`.\n        *   The cluster for the TR output quadrant is `TL_Cluster`.\n    *   Else:\n        *   Set `Assembly_Rule = A`.\n        *   The cluster for the TL output quadrant is `TL_Cluster`. Apply `Rotation = False`.\n        *   The cluster for the TR output quadrant is `TR_Cluster`.\n    *   The cluster for the BL output quadrant is `BL_Cluster`.\n    *   The cluster for the BR output quadrant is `BR_Cluster`.\n5.  **Extract and Transform Subgrids**:\n    *   For each of the four clusters (`TL_Cluster`, `TR_Cluster`, `BL_Cluster`, `BR_Cluster`), extract the content of the top-left NxN area of its bounding box into `Subgrid_TL`, `Subgrid_TR`, `Subgrid_BL`, `Subgrid_BR` respectively.\n    *   If `Rotation` is `True`, rotate `Subgrid_TR` (the subgrid sourced from the TR-role cluster) by 270 degrees clockwise. Let the result be `Transformed_Subgrid_For_TL_Output`. Otherwise, `Transformed_Subgrid_For_TL_Output` is `Subgrid_TL`.\n    *   Let `Subgrid_For_TR_Output` be `Subgrid_TL` if `Assembly_Rule == B`, otherwise it's `Subgrid_TR`.\n    *   `Subgrid_For_BL_Output` is `Subgrid_BL`.\n    *   `Subgrid_For_BR_Output` is `Subgrid_BR`.\n6.  **Assemble Initial Output Grid**:\n    *   Create a new 2N x 2N grid, initially filled with 0s or a placeholder.\n    *   Place `Transformed_Subgrid_For_TL_Output` in the top-left quadrant (rows 0 to N-1, cols 0 to N-1).\n    *   Place `Subgrid_For_TR_Output` in the top-right quadrant (rows 0 to N-1, cols N to 2N-1).\n    *   Place `Subgrid_For_BL_Output` in the bottom-left quadrant (rows N to 2N-1, cols 0 to N-1).\n    *   Place `Subgrid_For_BR_Output` in the bottom-right quadrant (rows N to 2N-1, cols N to 2N-1).\n7.  **Fill Zeroes**:\n    *   Create a copy of the assembled grid, let it be `OutputGrid`.\n    *   Iterate through each quadrant of `OutputGrid`.\n    *   Determine the source cluster for that quadrant (e.g., TL output quadrant sourced from `TR_Cluster` if Assembly B). Get the dominant digit of that source cluster.\n    *   For every cell `(r, c)` within that quadrant in `OutputGrid` that still contains the initial placeholder/zero from the source subgrid, replace its value with the dominant digit of the source cluster.\n8.  **Apply Boundary Overrides**: Modify `OutputGrid` based on the calculated N, k, and the dominant digits associated with the original cluster roles (`Dom(TL_Cluster)`, `Dom(TR_Cluster)`, `Dom(BL_Cluster)`, `Dom(BR_Cluster)`):\n    *   Identify the cluster that was placed in the TL Output quadrant. Check if the original digit `5` was present anywhere in that source cluster's bounding box. If yes, set `OutputGrid[0, 0] = 5`.\n    *   Set `OutputGrid[N-1, k] = Dom(BL_Cluster)`.\n    *   Set `OutputGrid[k, N] = Dom(TL_Cluster)`.\n    *   Set `OutputGrid[N-1, N+k] = Dom(BR_Cluster)`.\n    *   Set `OutputGrid[N+k, 0] = Dom(BL_Cluster)`.\n    *   Set `OutputGrid[N+k, 1] = Dom(BL_Cluster)`.\n    *   If `N >= 5`, set `OutputGrid[N-2, N+k] = Dom(BR_Cluster)`.\n9.  **Final Output**: The modified `OutputGrid` is the final result."
