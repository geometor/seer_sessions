"""
Transforms a sparse 20x20 input grid containing four distinct digit clusters into a smaller, dense output grid.

The transformation involves:
1.  Identifying the four non-zero digit clusters in the input grid.
2.  Calculating properties for each cluster: bounding box, dimensions (H, W), center, dominant digit, and presence of the digit 5.
3.  Determining the size 'N' for subgrids based on the minimum of the maximum dimensions (H or W) of the four clusters.
4.  Assigning roles (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) to the clusters based on their center coordinates.
5.  Selecting an assembly rule (A or B) based on the vertical alignment of the Top-Left and Top-Right role clusters. Rule B involves swapping the placement of the top two clusters and rotating the one originally in the Top-Right role (which ends up in the top-left output quadrant).
6.  Extracting the top-left NxN subgrid from each cluster's bounding box.
7.  Assembling a 2N x 2N output grid by placing the extracted (and potentially rotated) subgrids according to the selected assembly rule.
8.  Filling any zero cells within each quadrant of the assembled grid with the dominant digit of the cluster that *sourced* that quadrant.
9.  Applying specific modifications, including:
    - Setting the top-left cell (0,0) to 5 if any input cluster contained the digit 5.
    - Overwriting specific cells near the internal boundaries based on N and the dominant digits of the original role clusters. (Note: The exact boundary interaction rules derived from examples N=3 and N=5 might not perfectly generalize to all N, particularly N=2, suggesting a more complex underlying mechanism not fully captured yet).
