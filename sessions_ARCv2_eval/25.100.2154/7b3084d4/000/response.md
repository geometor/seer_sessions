Okay, analyzing the first example pair.

## Initial Perception

The input is a large sparse grid (20x20) containing four distinct clusters of non-zero digits (3s, 4s, 7s/5s, 9s) on a background of zeros. The output is a smaller, dense grid (6x6) containing digits derived from the input clusters. The transformation appears to involve identifying the four input clusters, extracting a representative shape or section from each, potentially transforming (like rotating) one of them, arranging these sections into a 2x2 layout in the output grid, and then filling in gaps and adjusting values at the boundaries between the sections. Specifically, the 7/5 cluster seems rotated and placed top-left, the 9s top-right, the 4s bottom-left, and the 3s bottom-right. The final output grid seems to have interactions or overwrites happening at the internal boundaries of the 2x2 arrangement.

Transformation:
  Actions:
    - Identification: Find 4 non-zero digit clusters (C1, C2, C3, C4).
    - Extraction: Get minimal bounding box for each cluster.
    - Cropping: Take the top-left 3x3 section of each cluster's bounding box content.
    - Transformation: Rotate the 3x3 section from C2 (7s/5s) 270 degrees clockwise.
    - Assembly: Arrange the 3x3 sections into a 6x6 grid (Rotated C2 -> TL, C1 -> TR, C3 -> BL, C4 -> BR).
    - Filling: Fill cells that were initially 0 in the assembled 3x3 sections.
      - Rule: Seems based on the dominant digit of the quadrant (TL=7, TR=9, BL=4, BR=3), but with specific exceptions for cells (1,2) and (2,1) which take values (9 and 4 respectively) from adjacent quadrants.
    - Overwriting: Modify specific cell values at the internal boundaries based on neighbor values.
      - Rule: Seems like cell[2,4] takes value from cell[3,4], cell[4,3] from cell[4,2], cell[4,4] from cell[4,3].

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Objects**: Scan the input 20x20 grid to find the four distinct connected components (clusters) of non-zero digits. Identify them based on their primary digit: C1 (9s), C2 (7s/5s), C3 (4s), and C4 (3s).
2.  **Extract Subgrids**: For each identified cluster, determine its minimal bounding box. Extract the content within the top-left 3x3 area of this bounding box. Let these 3x3 grids be `Subgrid_C1`, `Subgrid_C2`, `Subgrid_C3`, `Subgrid_C4`.
3.  **Transform Subgrid C2**: Rotate `Subgrid_C2` (containing the 7s and 5) by 270 degrees clockwise. Let the result be `Rotated_Subgrid_C2`.
4.  **Assemble Output Grid**: Create a new 6x6 grid. Place the four 3x3 subgrids into the 6x6 grid as follows:
    *   `Rotated_Subgrid_C2` in the top-left quadrant (rows 0-2, cols 0-2).
    *   `Subgrid_C1` in the top-right quadrant (rows 0-2, cols 3-5).
    *   `Subgrid_C3` in the bottom-left quadrant (rows 3-5, cols 0-2).
    *   `Subgrid_C4` in the bottom-right quadrant (rows 3-5, cols 3-5).
5.  **Fill Zero Cells**: Create a temporary copy of the assembled 6x6 grid. Iterate through the 6x6 grid. If a cell `(r, c)` in the temporary copy contains a 0:
    *   Determine the quadrant: TL (0<=r<3, 0<=c<3), TR (0<=r<3, 3<=c<6), BL (3<=r<6, 0<=c<3), BR (3<=r<6, 3<=c<6).
    *   Assign a fill value based on the quadrant's original dominant digit (TL=7, TR=9, BL=4, BR=3). Update the cell `(r, c)` in the main 6x6 grid with this fill value.
6.  **Apply Specific Zero-Fill Overrides**: After the initial fill, specifically set:
    *   `grid[1, 2] = 9` (overriding the fill value based on TL quadrant).
    *   `grid[2, 1] = 4` (overriding the fill value based on TL quadrant).
7.  **Apply Boundary Overwrites**: Modify the values of specific cells located near the internal boundaries based on the values of their neighbors *after* the zero-filling and overrides:
    *   Set `grid[2, 4] = grid[3, 4]`.
    *   Set `grid[4, 3] = grid[4, 2]`.
    *   Set `grid[4, 4] = grid[4, 3]` (using the newly updated value of `grid[4, 3]`).
8.  **Final Output**: The resulting 6x6 grid is the final output.
