            "text": "**Refined Perception:**\n\nThe core task involves identifying exactly two objects within the input grid that share the same height, `H`. The transformation rule used to construct the output depends on the properties of the *other* objects (those not having height `H`).\n\nThere appear to be two distinct transformation pathways:\n\n1.  **Simple Concatenation:** If none of the \"ignored\" objects (height != `H`) are wider than the rightmost object of the selected pair, the output is formed by taking the content of the rightmost object of the pair and concatenating it with a sliced version (first column removed) of the leftmost object of the pair. The output dimensions are `H` rows by `Width(Right) + Width(Left) - 1` columns. (`train_1` follows this path).\n2.  **Complex Assembly with Padding:** If there exists an \"ignored\" object `C` that is wider than the rightmost object of the selected pair, a more complex assembly is used. The output includes padding derived from the widest such ignored object `C`, followed by sliced portions of the selected pair (Left object `A`, Right object `B`). Specifically, the output seems to be constructed from:\n    *   Padding based on `C`'s content (specifically, `C`'s content truncated to width `Width(C)-2` and vertically centered to height `H`).\n    *   A slice of `A` (removing the first two columns).\n    *   A reordered version of `B` (moving its column 2 to the beginning of its contribution).\n    The output width in this case is `(Width(C)-2) + (Width(A)-2) + Width(B)`. (`train_2` follows this path).\n\nThe background digit varies between examples and is used for padding when required. Object identification relies on connected components of non-background digits. The relative horizontal position (left/right) of the selected pair is crucial for applying the rules.\n\n**Updated YAML:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_type: conditional_grid_transformation\ninput_properties:\n  - grid_representation: matrix of digits\n  - background_digit: determined per example (e.g., 8, 4)\n  - foreground_elements: clusters of non-background digits\nobjects:\n  - role: selected_pair # Objects A and B\n    criteria:\n      - find connected components of non-background digits\n      - calculate bounding_box and height H for each\n      - identify the height H_pair shared by exactly two objects\n      - select the two objects (A, B) with height H_pair\n    properties:\n      - content: subgrid within bounding box\n      - height: H_pair\n      - width: W_A, W_B\n      - position: Left (A), Right (B) based on min column index\n  - role: ignored_set # Objects C...\n    criteria:\n      - all objects not in selected_pair\n    properties:\n      - content: subgrid within bounding box\n      - height: H_C != H_pair\n      - width: W_C\nrelationships:\n  - type: width_comparison\n    objects: [Widest_Ignored_Object (C_maxW), Right_Selected_Object (B)]\n    condition: W_C_maxW > W_B\ntransformation_logic:\n  - condition: W_C_maxW <= W_B (or no ignored objects) # Simple Rule (e.g., train_1)\n    steps:\n      - extract: Content_A (from Left Object A), Content_B (from Right Object B)\n      - slice: Sliced_Content_A = Content_A[:, 1:] # Remove first column\n      - concatenate: Output = hstack(Content_B, Sliced_Content_A)\n  - condition: W_C_maxW > W_B # Complex Rule (e.g., train_2)\n    steps:\n      - identify: Widest_Ignored_Object C (content: Content_C, width: W_C)\n      - extract: Content_A (from Left Object A, width W_A), Content_B (from Right Object B, width W_B)\n      - calculate_pad_width: Pad_W = W_C - 2\n      - slice_pad_content: Pad_Content_Base = Content_C[:, :Pad_W]\n      - create_padding: Pad = vertically_center(Pad_Content_Base, target_height=H_pair, pad_value=background_digit)\n      - slice_left: Slice_A = Content_A[:, 2:] # Remove first two columns\n      - slice_right_parts:\n          - R_Part1 = Content_B[:, 2:3] # Column 2\n          - R_Part2 = Content_B[:, 0:2] # Columns 0, 1\n          - R_Part3 = Content_B[:, 3:] # Columns 3 onwards\n      - reassemble_right: Slice_B = hstack(R_Part1, R_Part2, R_Part3)\n      - concatenate: Output = hstack(Pad, Slice_A, Slice_B)\noutput_properties:\n  - grid_representation: matrix of digits\n  - dimensions: H_pair rows, variable width depending on rule applied\n  - content_origin: derived from selected_pair objects and potentially widest ignored object\n```\n\n**Updated Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Identify the most frequent digit in the input grid; this is the background digit (BG).\n2.  Find all connected components (objects) of non-BG digits. For each object, determine its bounding box, height (H), and width (W).\n3.  Find the height value (`H_pair`) that is the height of exactly two objects. Let these two objects be the `selected_pair`.\n4.  Identify the `Left_Object` (A) and `Right_Object` (B) within the `selected_pair` based on their minimum column indices. Let their widths be `W_A` and `W_B`. Extract their content (`Content_A`, `Content_B`).\n5.  Identify all other objects as the `ignored_set`.\n6.  Find the object `C` in the `ignored_set` with the maximum width (`W_C_maxW`). If the `ignored_set` is empty or no object exists, consider `W_C_maxW` to be 0.\n7.  **Conditional Rule Selection:**\n    *   **If `W_C_maxW` is greater than `W_B`:**\n        *   Apply the **Complex Rule**:\n            *   Extract the content of object `C` (`Content_C`).\n            *   Calculate the padding width: `Pad_W = W_C_maxW - 2`.\n            *   Take the first `Pad_W` columns of `Content_C`.\n            *   Create the `Padding` grid by vertically centering this sliced content within a new grid of height `H_pair` and width `Pad_W`, using BG for padding above and below.\n            *   Create `Slice_A` by taking all columns of `Content_A` *except* the first two.\n            *   Create `Slice_B` by taking column 2 of `Content_B`, followed by columns 0 and 1 of `Content_B`, followed by columns 3 onwards of `Content_B`, and concatenating them horizontally.\n            *   Construct the final output grid by horizontally concatenating `Padding`, `Slice_A`, and `Slice_B` in that order.\n    *   **Else (`W_C_maxW` is not greater than `W_B`):**\n        *   Apply the **Simple Rule**:\n            *   Create `Sliced_Content_A` by taking all columns of `Content_A` *except* the first column.\n            *   Construct the final output grid by horizontally concatenating `Content_B` and `Sliced_Content_A` in that order.\n8.  Return the constructed output grid."
