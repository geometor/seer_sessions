            "text": "Okay, analyzing the first example pair.\n\n**Initial Perception:**\n\nThe input is a large grid primarily filled with the digit '8', which appears to be a background color. Scattered within this background are three distinct \"objects\" or clusters formed by other digits (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9). Two of these objects (one located roughly top-center, the other middle-right) seem to share a common height (5 rows), while the third object (bottom-left) has a different height (3 rows).\n\nThe output is a smaller grid. Its content strongly resembles a combination of the two input objects that share the same height (5 rows). Specifically, it looks like the rightmost 5-row-high object is placed first, followed by a modified version (missing the first column) of the leftmost 5-row-high object. The 3-row-high object seems to be ignored in the transformation.\n\n**Observed Facts (YAML):**\n\n```yaml\ntask_type: grid_transformation\ninput_properties:\n  - grid_representation: matrix of digits\n  - background_digit: 8\n  - foreground_elements: clusters of non-8 digits\nobjects:\n  - id: C1 # Cluster 1 (leftmost, 5-high)\n    location: roughly rows 6-10, cols 6-15\n    height: 5\n    width: 10 # Based on bounding box of non-8s\n    content: subgrid containing digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 9 and background 8s\n    bounding_box: rows 6-10, cols 6-15\n  - id: C2 # Cluster 2 (rightmost, 5-high)\n    location: roughly rows 11-15, cols 20-22\n    height: 5\n    width: 3 # Based on bounding box of non-8s\n    content: subgrid containing digits 1, 4, 6, 9 and background 8s\n    bounding_box: rows 11-15, cols 20-22\n  - id: C3 # Cluster 3 (ignored?)\n    location: roughly rows 18-20, cols 3-5\n    height: 3\n    width: 3\n    content: subgrid containing digits 2, 3\n    bounding_box: rows 18-20, cols 3-5\nrelationships:\n  - type: height_match\n    objects: [C1, C2]\n    value: 5\n  - type: relative_horizontal_position\n    objects: [C1, C2]\n    relation: C1 is to the left of C2 (based on min column index)\noutput_properties:\n  - grid_representation: matrix of digits\n  - dimensions: 5 rows, 12 columns (matches height of C1/C2, width is width(C2) + width(C1) - 1)\n  - content_origin: derived from C1 and C2\ntransformation:\n  - action: identify_objects\n    criteria: connected components of non-background (non-8) digits\n  - action: filter_objects\n    criteria: select objects with matching height (height=5 in this case), resulting in C1 and C2\n  - action: order_objects\n    criteria: horizontal position (min column index), C1 (left), C2 (right)\n  - action: extract_content\n    source: C1 -> Content_Left\n    source: C2 -> Content_Right\n  - action: slice_content\n    source: Content_Left\n    operation: remove first column -> Sliced_Content_Left\n  - action: concatenate_content\n    part1: Content_Right\n    part2: Sliced_Content_Left\n    axis: horizontal\n    result: output grid\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Identify the background digit ('8').\n2.  Find all distinct connected groups (objects) of non-background digits in the input grid.\n3.  Determine the bounding box and height for each object.\n4.  Find the height value `H` that is shared by exactly two objects.\n5.  Select the two objects (Object_A, Object_B) that have height `H`.\n6.  Identify which object is horizontally positioned to the left (Object_Left) and which is to the right (Object_Right) based on their minimum column indices.\n7.  Extract the subgrid corresponding to the bounding box of Object_Left (Content_Left).\n8.  Extract the subgrid corresponding to the bounding box of Object_Right (Content_Right).\n9.  Create a new subgrid, Sliced_Content_Left, by taking all columns of Content_Left *except* the first column.\n10. Construct the output grid by horizontally concatenating Content_Right and Sliced_Content_Left, placing Content_Right on the left and Sliced_Content_Left on the right."
