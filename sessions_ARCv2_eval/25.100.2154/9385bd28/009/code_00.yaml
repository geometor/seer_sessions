# Facts observed from all training examples and code execution analysis
grid_properties:
  size: variable
  background_color_rule: most frequent color in the input grid # Confirmed
colors:
  present_in_input: variable
  present_in_output: variable
  unique_input_colors_rule: colors appearing exactly once (excluding background_color) # Confirmed
  fill_colors_determination:
    mode_selection: based on presence of unique_input_colors # Confirmed
    mode_unique_colors:
      candidates_rule: form pairs (uc, neighbor_or_uc); neighbor is non-bg orthogonal neighbor, neighbor_or_uc can be uc itself # Confirmed
      outer_fill_color_rule: value from the candidate pair with the maximum value, breaking ties by maximizing uc # Confirmed
      uc_used_rule: the unique color 'uc' from the pair selected for outer_fill_color # Confirmed
      inner_fill_color_rule: (if >1 unique color exists) highest unique color NOT equal to uc_used # Confirmed
    mode_no_unique_colors:
      trigger: process per distinct color C found in size-3 objects # Confirmed
      fill_color_rule(C): max(max_adjacent_non_background_neighbor, C) # Confirmed (Corrected from previous attempts)
  most_frequent_non_background_color_rule: find the set of colors sharing the maximum frequency among non-background colors # Confirmed
objects_input:
  properties: # Confirmed
    - id
    - color
    - location (list of [row, col])
    - size (number of cells)
  criteria: # Confirmed identification criteria
    size_3_objects: objects with size = 3
    size_3_lt_5_objects: size-3 objects with color < 5 (used for Mode 1 Outer BB)
transformation:

  condition: presence of unique input colors # Confirmed
  mode_unique_colors:
    layers:
      - layer_id: outer_fill
        fill_color_rule: Use outer_fill_color determined above # Confirmed
        region_definition:
          method: minimal_bounding_box # Confirmed method type
          source_objects: size_3_objects with color < 5 # Confirmed correct source objects
        fill_rule: replace background_color only # Confirmed
      - layer_id: inner_fill (conditional)
        condition: inner_fill_color exists # Confirmed correct trigger
        fill_color_rule: Use inner_fill_color determined above # Confirmed

          method: minimal_bounding_box # Assumed method type
          source_objects_rule: | # RULE IS UNCERTAIN / INCORRECT
            Current hypothesis (known flawed): Select from 'size_3_lt_5_objects' those whose color is NOT in the set of most_frequent_non_background_color(s).
            *Known Issue: Produces incorrect regions for E2 (slightly) and E3 (majorly). The correct rule is unknown.*
        fill_rule: replace background_color only (overwrites outer fill) # Confirmed
  mode_no_unique_colors:
    process_per_color_group: For each distinct color C in size_3_objects (sorted numerically) # Confirmed structure
      layers:
        - layer_id: fill_for_C
          fill_color_rule: Use fill_color_C determined above (max(adj, C)) # Confirmed
          region_definition:
            method: minimal_bounding_box # RULE IS UNCERTAIN / INCORRECT
            source_objects: size_3_objects with color C # Assumed source
            *Known Issue: Produces incorrect region for C=6 in E4 (where fill color came from neighbor). The correct rule is unknown.*
          fill_rule: replace background_color only # Confirmed
          overlap_rule: Later fills (higher C) overwrite earlier fills # Confirmed behavior
  preservation:
    - all original non-background cells retain their color and position # Confirmed
