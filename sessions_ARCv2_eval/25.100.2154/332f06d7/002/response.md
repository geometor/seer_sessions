## Refined Perception

The core task involves identifying the largest monochromatic square blocks (MSBs) of digits '0' and '2' within the input grid (excluding the border). The transformation applied depends on the presence and relative sizes of these blocks.

Based on all three examples:
1.  The transformation hinges on finding the largest square block of '0's (0-MSB) and the largest square block of '2's (2-MSB). Let their side lengths be N0 and N2, respectively.
2.  **Scenario 1 (Only 0-MSB exists):** If a 0-MSB is found (N0 > 0) but no 2-MSB exists (N2 = 0), the 0-MSB is converted to a block of '1's of the same size, and *all* individual '2's *anywhere* in the grid are converted to '0's. (Seen in `train_1` where N0=2, N2=0).
3.  **Scenario 2 (Both 0-MSB and 2-MSB exist):** If both a 0-MSB (N0 > 0) and a 2-MSB (N2 > 0) are found, and crucially, *if they have the same size* (N0 = N2 = N), then:
    *   The 0-MSB is converted to a block of '1's of size N.
    *   The 2-MSB remains unchanged (block of '2's of size N).
    *   A *specific* MSB of '1's, also of size N, is identified and converted to a block of '0's. (Seen in `train_2` where N=2, and `train_3` where N=3).
4.  **Selection of the 1-MSB:** In Scenario 2, the 1-MSB that gets converted to '0's appears to be the *first* block of '1's with side length N encountered when scanning the grid top-to-bottom, left-to-right.
5.  Digits '3' (primarily the border) and any '1's not part of the selected 1-MSB in Scenario 2 remain unchanged.

The concept of 2x2 blocks from the initial hypothesis was too specific; the relevant feature is the largest monochromatic square block for '0's and '2's, and matching-sized blocks for '1's under certain conditions.

## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Define a function `find_largest_msb(grid, digit)` that searches the input grid (excluding borders) for monochromatic square blocks of the specified `digit`. It should return the top-left coordinate and the size (N) of the largest such block found. If multiple largest blocks exist, return the one whose top-left coordinate comes first in reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right). If no block (N>=2) is found, return size N=0.
3.  Call `find_largest_msb` for digit '0' to get `(coord0, N0)`.
4.  Call `find_largest_msb` for digit '2' to get `(coord2, N2)`.
5.  **Check Scenario 1:** If `N0 > 0` AND `N2 == 0`:
    *   Iterate through the cells forming the N0xN0 block starting at `coord0`. For each cell in this block, set the corresponding output grid cell value to '1'.
    *   Iterate through all cells of the input grid (excluding borders). If an input cell contains '2', set the corresponding output grid cell value to '0'.
6.  **Check Scenario 2:** If `N0 > 0` AND `N2 > 0` AND `N0 == N2`:
    *   Let N = N0.
    *   Iterate through the cells forming the NxN block starting at `coord0`. For each cell in this block, set the corresponding output grid cell value to '1'.
    *   (The NxN block of '2's starting at `coord2` remains '2' because the output was initialized as a copy).
    *   Define a function `find_first_msb_of_size(grid, digit, size)` that finds the first MSB (in reading order) of the specified `digit` having the exact side length `size`. Return its top-left coordinate (`coord1_special`). If none is found, return a special value (e.g., None).
    *   Call `find_first_msb_of_size` for digit '1' and size N to get `coord1_special`.
    *   If `coord1_special` is found (not None):
        *   Iterate through the cells forming the NxN block starting at `coord1_special`. For each cell in this block, set the corresponding output grid cell value to '0'.
7.  **Fallback:** If neither Scenario 1 nor Scenario 2 conditions are met, the output grid remains the initial copy of the input grid.
8.  Return the final output grid.
