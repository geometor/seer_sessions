## Initial Perception

The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (12x12). The grids contain numerical digits (0, 1, 2, 3 in the input; 0, 1, 3 in the output). A border composed of the digit '3' surrounds both grids and remains unchanged. The core transformation seems to involve swapping specific digits within the grid's interior. Specifically, the digit '2' in the input is replaced by '0' in the output, and the digit '0' in the input is replaced by '1' in the output. The digit '1' appears to remain '1', and the digit '3' remains '3'.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
2.  For each cell, check the digit value:
    *   If the value is '2', change it to '0' in the corresponding output cell.
    *   If the value is '0', change it to '1' in the corresponding output cell.
    *   If the value is '1', keep it as '1' in the corresponding output cell.
    *   If the value is '3', keep it as '3' in the corresponding output cell.
3.  Construct the output grid with these modified cell values.

## Refined Perception

The core transformation involves mapping input digits to output digits, primarily focused on '0' and '2'. However, the specific mapping rules are conditional, depending on the presence and potentially the configuration (specifically, forming 2x2 blocks) of these digits within the input grid.

Observing both examples reveals two distinct modes of operation:

1.  **Mode 1 (Seen in `train_1`):** When a 2x2 block of '0's is present, but *no* 2x2 block of '2's exists:
    *   The '0's (in the 2x2 block) are changed to '1's.
    *   *All* instances of '2' (regardless of their configuration) are changed to '0's.
    *   '1's and '3's remain unchanged.

2.  **Mode 2 (Seen in `train_2`):** When *both* a 2x2 block of '0's *and* a 2x2 block of '2's are present:
    *   The '0's (in the 2x2 block) are changed to '1's.
    *   The '2's (in the 2x2 block) *remain* '2's.
    *   A *specific* 2x2 block of '1's is changed to '0's. (In `train_2`, this was the block at (7,9)-(8,10)).
    *   Other '1's and '3's remain unchanged.

The key differentiator between the examples is the presence of a 2x2 block of '2's in `train_2`, which triggers the preservation of those '2's and the transformation of a specific '1' block, contrasting with `train_1` where the absence of a '2' block led to all '2's becoming '0's. The transformation `0 -> 1` (for 2x2 blocks of 0s) appears consistent across both modes where such blocks exist. The identification criteria for the "specific" 2x2 block of '1's in Mode 2 needs further clarification if more examples were provided, but based on `train_2`, it was a distinct 2x2 block separate from the 0s and 2s blocks.

## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Search the input grid (excluding borders) for a 2x2 block composed entirely of '0's. Record its location(s) if found (L0_block).
3.  Search the input grid (excluding borders) for a 2x2 block composed entirely of '2's. Record its location(s) if found (L2_block).
4.  **Check Condition 1:** If an L0_block was found AND an L2_block was *not* found:
    *   For each cell within the found L0_block(s), change the corresponding output cell value to '1'.
    *   Find *all* cells in the input grid containing '2' (L2_any).
    *   For each cell location in L2_any, change the corresponding output cell value to '0'.
5.  **Check Condition 2:** If *both* an L0_block was found AND an L2_block was found:
    *   For each cell within the found L0_block(s), change the corresponding output cell value to '1'.
    *   (The '2's in the L2_block remain '2' as per the initial copy).
    *   Search the input grid for *all* 2x2 blocks composed entirely of '1's (L1_blocks).
    *   Identify *one specific* block from L1_blocks (L1_special). (Rule for choosing needs confirmation, e.g., based on position like centrality or index).
    *   For each cell within L1_special, change the corresponding output cell value to '0'.
6.  (Implicit) All other cells ('3's, and '1's not covered by the rules above) retain their original values from the initial copy.
7.  Return the final output grid.

## Refined Perception

The core task involves identifying the largest monochromatic square blocks (MSBs) of digits '0' and '2' within the input grid (excluding the border). The transformation applied depends on the presence and relative sizes of these blocks.

Based on all three examples:
1.  The transformation hinges on finding the largest square block of '0's (0-MSB) and the largest square block of '2's (2-MSB). Let their side lengths be N0 and N2, respectively.
2.  **Scenario 1 (Only 0-MSB exists):** If a 0-MSB is found (N0 > 0) but no 2-MSB exists (N2 = 0), the 0-MSB is converted to a block of '1's of the same size, and *all* individual '2's *anywhere* in the grid are converted to '0's. (Seen in `train_1` where N0=2, N2=0).
3.  **Scenario 2 (Both 0-MSB and 2-MSB exist):** If both a 0-MSB (N0 > 0) and a 2-MSB (N2 > 0) are found, and crucially, *if they have the same size* (N0 = N2 = N), then:
    *   The 0-MSB is converted to a block of '1's of size N.
    *   The 2-MSB remains unchanged (block of '2's of size N).
    *   A *specific* MSB of '1's, also of size N, is identified and converted to a block of '0's. (Seen in `train_2` where N=2, and `train_3` where N=3).
4.  **Selection of the 1-MSB:** In Scenario 2, the 1-MSB that gets converted to '0's appears to be the *first* block of '1's with side length N encountered when scanning the grid top-to-bottom, left-to-right.
5.  Digits '3' (primarily the border) and any '1's not part of the selected 1-MSB in Scenario 2 remain unchanged.

The concept of 2x2 blocks from the initial hypothesis was too specific; the relevant feature is the largest monochromatic square block for '0's and '2's, and matching-sized blocks for '1's under certain conditions.

## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Define a function `find_largest_msb(grid, digit)` that searches the input grid (excluding borders) for monochromatic square blocks of the specified `digit`. It should return the top-left coordinate and the size (N) of the largest such block found. If multiple largest blocks exist, return the one whose top-left coordinate comes first in reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right). If no block (N>=2) is found, return size N=0.
3.  Call `find_largest_msb` for digit '0' to get `(coord0, N0)`.
4.  Call `find_largest_msb` for digit '2' to get `(coord2, N2)`.
5.  **Check Scenario 1:** If `N0 > 0` AND `N2 == 0`:
    *   Iterate through the cells forming the N0xN0 block starting at `coord0`. For each cell in this block, set the corresponding output grid cell value to '1'.
    *   Iterate through all cells of the input grid (excluding borders). If an input cell contains '2', set the corresponding output grid cell value to '0'.
6.  **Check Scenario 2:** If `N0 > 0` AND `N2 > 0` AND `N0 == N2`:
    *   Let N = N0.
    *   Iterate through the cells forming the NxN block starting at `coord0`. For each cell in this block, set the corresponding output grid cell value to '1'.
    *   (The NxN block of '2's starting at `coord2` remains '2' because the output was initialized as a copy).
    *   Define a function `find_first_msb_of_size(grid, digit, size)` that finds the first MSB (in reading order) of the specified `digit` having the exact side length `size`. Return its top-left coordinate (`coord1_special`). If none is found, return a special value (e.g., None).
    *   Call `find_first_msb_of_size` for digit '1' and size N to get `coord1_special`.
    *   If `coord1_special` is found (not None):
        *   Iterate through the cells forming the NxN block starting at `coord1_special`. For each cell in this block, set the corresponding output grid cell value to '0'.
7.  **Fallback:** If neither Scenario 1 nor Scenario 2 conditions are met, the output grid remains the initial copy of the input grid.
8.  Return the final output grid.
