            "text": "## Refined Perception\n\nThe core transformation rule appears to be a simple digit substitution: '0' becomes '1', and '2' becomes '0'. Digits '1' and '3' remain unchanged by default.\n\nHowever, there is a significant exception condition: This simple substitution rule is overridden *if and only if* the input grid contains *both* a largest monochromatic square block (MSB) of '0's (with side length N0 >= 2) *and* a largest MSB of '2's (with side length N2 >= 2), *and* these blocks have the *exact same size* (N0 = N2 = N).\n\nWhen this specific exception condition is met:\n1.  The '0's *within* the identified largest 0-MSB change to '1's.\n2.  The '2's *within* the identified largest 2-MSB *remain* '2's (overriding the default 2->0 rule for these specific cells).\n3.  A specific MSB of '1's, which must also have the same size N, is identified (the first one found in reading order) and changed to a block of '0's.\n4.  Any '0's or '2's *outside* these specific MSBs still follow the default substitution rule (0->1, 2->0). (Though the provided examples for this exception case did not contain such stray digits).\n\nIf the exception condition is *not* met (either because there isn't an MSB >= 2x2 for '0' or '2', or because their largest MSBs have different sizes), then the simple default substitution (0->1, 2->0 everywhere) applies to the entire grid.\n\nExample `train_4` confirms the default behaviour: no 0-MSB or 2-MSB of size N>=2 exists, so the single '0' becomes '1' and the single '2' becomes '0'. This clarifies that the MSB logic is an *exception* rather than the primary rule.\n\n## Updated Observed Facts\n\n```yaml\ntask_elements:\n  - grid:\n      type: object\n      description: A 2D array of digits.\n      properties:\n        - dimensions: variable\n        - unique_values_input: [0, 1, 2, 3]\n        - unique_values_output: [0, 1, 2, 3]\n  - border:\n      type: object\n      description: A frame composed of a single digit ('3') surrounding the grid's content.\n      properties:\n        - value: 3\n        - thickness: 1 cell (observed)\n      relationships:\n        - unchanged: between input and output\n  - digits:\n      type: object\n      description: Individual numerical values within the grid cells, excluding the border.\n      properties:\n        - default_value_map:\n            input_0: output_1\n            input_2: output_0\n            input_1: output_1\n            input_3: output_3\n        - transformation_mode: Defaults to applying 'default_value_map' cell-wise, unless the exception condition is met.\n  - monochromatic_square_block:\n      type: object\n      description: An NxN square (N>=2) of identical digits (0, 1, or 2).

Define a function `find_largest_msb(grid, digit)` that searches the input grid (excluding borders) for monochromatic square blocks (size N>=2) of the specified `digit`. It returns the top-left coordinate and the size (N) of the largest such block. If multiple largest blocks exist, return the one whose top-left coordinate comes first in reading order. If no block (N>=2) is found, return size N=0 and a null coordinate.\n2.  Call `find_largest_msb` for digit '0' to get `(coord0, N0)`.\n3.  Call `find_largest_msb` for digit '2' to get `(coord2, N2)`.\n4.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n5.  **Check Exception Condition:** If `N0 >= 2` AND `N2 >= 2` AND `N0 == N2`:\n    *   Let N = N0.\n    *   Define a function `find_first_msb_of_size(grid, digit, size)` that finds the first MSB (in reading order) of the specified `digit` having the exact side length `size`. Return its top-left coordinate (`coord_special`). If none is found, return a null coordinate.\n    *   Call `find_first_msb_of_size` for digit '1' and size N to get `coord1_special`.\n    *   **Apply Transformations (Exception Case):**\n        *   Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the input grid (excluding border):\n            *   If cell `(r, c)` is within the N x N block starting at `coord0` (the 0-MSB): Set `output[r][c] = 1`.\n            *   Else if cell `(r, c)` is within the N x N block starting at `coord2` (the 2-MSB): Set `output[r][c] = 2`.\n            *   Else if `coord1_special` is not null AND cell `(r, c)` is within the N x N block starting at `coord1_special` (the special 1-MSB): Set `output[r][c] = 0`.\n            *   Else if `input[r][c] == 0`: Set `output[r][c] = 1`. # Handles potential stray 0s\n            *   Else if `input[r][c] == 2`: Set `output[r][c] = 0`. # Handles potential stray 2s\n            *   Else: `output[r][c]` remains the copied `input[r][c]` ('1' or '3').\n6.  **Default Behaviour:** If the exception condition in step 5 is *not* met:\n    *   Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the input grid (excluding border):\n        *   If `input[r][c] == 0`: Set `output[r][c] = 1`.\n        *   Else if `input[r][c] == 2`: Set `output[r][c] = 0`.\n        *   Else: `output[r][c]` remains the copied `input[r][c]` ('1' or '3').\n7.  Return the final output grid."
