task_elements:
  - grid:
      type: object
      description: A 2D array of digits.
      properties:
        - dimensions: variable
        - unique_values_input: [0, 1, 2, 3]
        - unique_values_output: [0, 1, 2, 3]
  - border:
      type: object
      description: A frame composed of a single digit ('3') surrounding the grid's content.
      properties:
        - value: 3
        - thickness: 1 cell (assumed)
      relationships:
        - unchanged: between input and output
        - boundary: Defines the area for MSB search (MSBs must be fully within the non-border area).
  - digits:
      type: object
      description: Individual numerical values within the grid cells.
      properties:
        - default_value_map:
            input_0: output_1
            input_2: output_0
            input_1: output_1
            input_3: output_3
        - transformation_mode: Defaults to applying 'default_value_map' cell-wise, unless the exception condition is met.
  - monochromatic_square_block:
      type: object
      description: An NxN square (N>=2) of identical digits (0, 1, or 2), located entirely within the non-border area.
      properties:
        - digit_value: The digit composing the block (0, 1, or 2).
        - size: The side length N of the square block.
        - top_left_coord: The (row, col) of the top-left cell of the block.
        - center_coord: Geometric center (row+N/2 - 0.5, col+N/2 - 0.5).
      relationships:
        - maximality: The exception condition compares the *largest* MSB for '0' and '2'. If multiple largest exist, use the first in reading order.
        - centrality: The exception action identifies the 1s-MSB (of matching size N) that is *closest* to the grid's center.

relationships:
  - identity: Grid dimensions remain constant between input and output for a given example.
  - identity: The border ('3') remains constant.
  - conditional_transformation:
      condition_check: Find the largest MSB of '0's (L0_MSB, size N0 >= 2) and the largest MSB of '2's (L2_MSB, size N2 >= 2) *within the non-border area*.
      exception_condition: (N0 >= 2) AND (N2 >= 2) AND (N0 == N2)
      actions_if_exception:
          - let N = N0 = N2.
          - find_block: Locate the largest 0-MSB (L0_MSB) and largest 2-MSB (L2_MSB).
          - find_target_block: Find all N x N MSBs of '1's (L1_candidates) within the non-border area. Select the L1_candidate (L1_target) whose center is closest to the grid center.
          - apply_map_selectively:
              - For cells within L0_MSB: input '0' -> output '1'.
              - For cells within L2_MSB: input '2' -> output '2'.
              - For cells within L1_target: input '1' -> output '0'.
              - For all *other* cells: Apply 'default_value_map' (0->1, 2->0, 1->1, 3->3).
      actions_if_no_exception:
          - apply_map_globally: Apply 'default_value_map' to all cells.
