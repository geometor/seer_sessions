            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code, likely based heavily on the first example or an incomplete hypothesis, failed on the first three training examples. The core issue was a misunderstanding of the conditions under which different transformation rules apply and how specific elements (like the 1s block) are chosen.\n\n*   **Example 1 Failure:** The code incorrectly applied an \"exception\" rule (preserving a 2s block and changing a 1s block) when the expected output clearly followed a simpler \"default\" rule (changing 0s to 1s and 2s to 0s). This was resolved by realizing the MSB search should likely ignore grid border cells (value 3) or that the definition of MSB might require cells to be within the non-border area. Specifically for `train_1`, if the 2s block at the edge isn't considered an MSB for the exception condition, then N2=0, the exception condition fails, and the default rule applies, matching the expected output.\n*   **Example 2 & 3 Failures:** The code correctly identified that an exception rule was needed (because N0=N2=N>=2, excluding borders), but it incorrectly identified *which* N x N block of 1s should be changed to 0s. The initial code simply chose the *first* such block found in reading order. The analysis revealed the correct target block is the one whose center is closest to the geometric center of the grid.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Refine the Monochromatic Square Block (MSB) finding functions to ensure they operate correctly, likely by restricting their search to the non-border area of the grid or explicitly checking cell values aren't the border value (3).\n2.  Implement the revised two-branch logic:\n    *   **Default Branch:** Applies when the exception condition is not met. Simple substitution: 0->1, 2->0.\n    *   **Exception Branch:** Applies when the largest 0-MSB (size N0>=2) and largest 2-MSB (size N2>=2) exist (within the non-border area) and have the same size (N0=N2=N).\n        *   Action: 0s in L0_MSB -> 1s; 2s in L2_MSB -> 2s; 1s in the *most central* L1_MSB of size N -> 0s; all other 0s -> 1s; all other 2s -> 0s.\n3.  Implement the logic to find the \"most central\" N x N block of 1s based on Euclidean distance from the grid center.\n\n## Metrics from Code Execution Analysis\n\n| Example   | Match | Pixels Off | Input Size | Output Size | Notes                                                                                                                               |\n| :-------- | :---- | :--------- | :--------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `train_1` | False | 8          | 12x12      | 12x12       | Code applied exception (2->2, 1->0 at first 1s block).

Initialize the output grid as a deep copy of the input grid.\n2.  Define a function `find_largest_msb(grid, digit)` that searches the input grid, *excluding the border cells (value 3 or cells at row 0, row max, col 0, col max)*, for monochromatic square blocks (size N>=2) of the specified `digit`. It returns the top-left coordinate and the size (N) of the largest such block found. If multiple largest blocks exist, return the one whose top-left coordinate comes first in reading order. If no block (N>=2) is found, return size N=0 and a null coordinate.\n3.  Call `find_largest_msb` for digit '0' to get `(coord0, N0)`.\n4.  Call `find_largest_msb` for digit '2' to get `(coord2, N2)`.\n5.  **Check Exception Condition:** Determine if `N0 >= 2` AND `N2 >= 2` AND `N0 == N2`.\n6.  **If Exception Condition is TRUE:**\n    *   Let N = N0.\n    *   Define a function `find_all_msb_of_size(grid, digit, size)` that finds all N x N MSBs of the specified `digit` within the non-border area and returns a list of their top-left coordinates.\n    *   Call `find_all_msb_of_size` for digit '1' and size N to get a list `l1_candidates`.\n    *   If `l1_candidates` is not empty:\n        *   Calculate the grid center coordinates: `center_r = (rows - 1) / 2`, `center_c = (cols - 1) / 2`.\n        *   For each `coord1` in `l1_candidates`, calculate the block's center: `block_center_r = coord1[0] + N / 2 - 0.5`, `block_center_c = coord1[1] + N / 2 - 0.5`.\n        *   Calculate the squared Euclidean distance from the block center to the grid center: `dist_sq = (block_center_r - center_r)^2 + (block_center_c - center_c)^2`.\n        *   Select the `coord1` from `l1_candidates` that has the minimum `dist_sq`. This is `coord1_target`. (Handle potential ties by choosing the one that appears first in `l1_candidates`, which corresponds to reading order).\n    *   Else (`l1_candidates` is empty): Set `coord1_target` to null. (This case seems unlikely based on examples, but handles completeness).\n    *   **Apply Transformations (Exception Case):**\n        *   Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the input grid:\n            *   Determine if `(r, c)` is within the N x N block starting at `coord0` (L0_MSB).\n            *   Determine if `(r, c)` is within the N x N block starting at `coord2` (L2_MSB).\n            *   Determine if `coord1_target` is not null AND `(r, c)` is within the N x N block starting at `coord1_target` (L1_target).\n            *   If the cell is in L2_MSB: Set `output[r][c] = 2`.\n            *   Else if the cell is in L1_target: Set `output[r][c] = 0`.\n            *   Else if `input[r][c] == 0`: Set `output[r][c] = 1`. (Handles L0_MSB and other 0s).\n            *   Else if `input[r][c] == 2`: Set `output[r][c] = 0`. (Handles other 2s).\n            *   Else: `output[r][c]` remains the copied `input[r][c]` ('1' or '3').\n7.  **If Exception Condition is FALSE:**\n    *   **Apply Transformations (Default Case):**\n        *   Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the input grid:\n            *   If `input[r][c] == 0`: Set `output[r][c] = 1`.\n            *   Else if `input[r][c] == 2`: Set `output[r][c] = 0`.\n            *   Else: `output[r][c]` remains the copied `input[r][c]` ('1' or '3').\n8.  Return the final output grid."
