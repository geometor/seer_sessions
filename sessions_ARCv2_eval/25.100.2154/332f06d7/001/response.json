            "text": "## Refined Perception\n\nThe core transformation involves mapping input digits to output digits, primarily focused on '0' and '2'. However, the specific mapping rules are conditional, depending on the presence and potentially the configuration (specifically, forming 2x2 blocks) of these digits within the input grid.\n\nObserving both examples reveals two distinct modes of operation:\n\n1.  **Mode 1 (Seen in `train_1`):** When a 2x2 block of '0's is present, but *no* 2x2 block of '2's exists:\n    *   The '0's (in the 2x2 block) are changed to '1's.\n    *   *All* instances of '2' (regardless of their configuration) are changed to '0's.\n    *   '1's and '3's remain unchanged.\n\n2.  **Mode 2 (Seen in `train_2`):** When *both* a 2x2 block of '0's *and* a 2x2 block of '2's are present:\n    *   The '0's (in the 2x2 block) are changed to '1's.\n    *   The '2's (in the 2x2 block) *remain* '2's.\n    *   A *specific* 2x2 block of '1's is changed to '0's. (In `train_2`, this was the block at (7,9)-(8,10)).\n    *   Other '1's and '3's remain unchanged.\n\nThe key differentiator between the examples is the presence of a 2x2 block of '2's in `train_2`, which triggers the preservation of those '2's and the transformation of a specific '1' block, contrasting with `train_1` where the absence of a '2' block led to all '2's becoming '0's. The transformation `0 -> 1` (for 2x2 blocks of 0s) appears consistent across both modes where such blocks exist. The identification criteria for the \"specific\" 2x2 block of '1's in Mode 2 needs further clarification if more examples were provided, but based on `train_2`, it was a distinct 2x2 block separate from the 0s and 2s blocks.\n\n## Updated Observed Facts\n\n```yaml\ntask_elements:\n  - grid:\n      type: object\n      description: A 2D array of digits.\n      properties:\n        - dimensions: variable (e.g., [12, 12] or [14, 14])\n        - unique_values_input: [0, 1, 2, 3]\n        - unique_values_output: [0, 1, 2, 3] # Updated based on train_2 output\n  - border:\n      type: object\n      description: A frame composed of a single digit ('3') surrounding the grid's content.\n      properties:\n        - value: 3\n        - thickness: 1 cell (observed)\n      relationships:\n        - unchanged: between input and output\n  - digits:\n      type: object\n      description: Individual numerical values within the grid cells, excluding the border.\n      properties:\n        - value_map: conditional based on 2x2 blocks\n  - two_by_two_block:\n      type: object\n      description: A 2x2 square of identical digits (0, 1, or 2).\n      properties:\n        - digit_value: The digit composing the block (0, 1, or 2).\n        - top_left_coord: The (row, col) of the top-left cell of the block.\nrelationships:\n  - identity: Grid dimensions remain constant between input and output for a given example.\n  - identity: The border ('3') remains constant.\n  - conditional_transformation:\n      condition: Input contains a 2x2 block of '0's (L0_block) AND input does NOT contain a 2x2 block of '2's.\n      actions:\n        - change_value: at L0_block, input '0' -> output '1'.\n        - change_value: for ALL input '2's (L2_any), input '2' -> output '0'.\n        - identity: all input '1's -> output '1'.\n  - conditional_transformation:\n      condition: Input contains a 2x2 block of '0's (L0_block) AND input contains a 2x2 block of '2's (L2_block).\n      actions:\n        - change_value: at L0_block, input '0' -> output '1'.\n        - identity: at L2_block, input '2' -> output '2'.\n        - find_specific: identify ONE specific 2x2 block of '1's (L1_special). # Specific identification rule TBD (e.g., most central? first found?)\n        - change_value: at L1_special, input '1' -> output '0'.\n        - identity: all other input '1's -> output '1'.\n```\n\n## Updated Natural Language Program\n\n1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2.  Search the input grid (excluding borders) for a 2x2 block composed entirely of '0's. Record its location(s) if found (L0_block).\n3.  Search the input grid (excluding borders) for a 2x2 block composed entirely of '2's. Record its location(s) if found (L2_block).\n4.  **Check Condition 1:** If an L0_block was found AND an L2_block was *not* found:\n    *   For each cell within the found L0_block(s), change the corresponding output cell value to '1'.\n    *   Find *all* cells in the input grid containing '2' (L2_any).\n    *   For each cell location in L2_any, change the corresponding output cell value to '0'.\n5.  **Check Condition 2:** If *both* an L0_block was found AND an L2_block was found:\n    *   For each cell within the found L0_block(s), change the corresponding output cell value to '1'.\n    *   (The '2's in the L2_block remain '2' as per the initial copy).\n    *   Search the input grid for *all* 2x2 blocks composed entirely of '1's (L1_blocks).\n    *   Identify *one specific* block from L1_blocks (L1_special). (Rule for choosing needs confirmation, e.g., based on position like centrality or index).\n    *   For each cell within L1_special, change the corresponding output cell value to '0'.\n6.  (Implicit) All other cells ('3's, and '1's not covered by the rules above) retain their original values from the initial copy.\n7.  Return the final output grid."
