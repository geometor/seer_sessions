## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided code execution results highlight a conditional transformation logic. The default behavior seems to be a simple digit substitution (0->1, 2->0), while an exception occurs under specific conditions involving Monochromatic Square Blocks (MSBs).

*   **Example 4 (Success):** Confirms the default rule (0->1, 2->0) applies when the exception criteria aren't met (no N>=2 MSBs for 0 or 2).
*   **Example 1 (Failure):** The code incorrectly applied the exception rule. The expected output follows the default rule. This suggests the MSB check for triggering the exception must exclude blocks touching the border or containing the border digit '3'. The 2x2 block of '2's in the input touches the border, thus likely not qualifying as a valid MSB for the exception condition (N2=0), leading to the default rule being applied, which matches the expected output.
*   **Example 3 (Success):** The code correctly identified the exception condition (N0=3, N2=3), preserved the 2s block, changed the 0s block to 1s, and correctly identified the target 3x3 block of 1s at (6,8) to change to 0s using the "closest to center" logic.
*   **Example 2 (Failure):** The code correctly identified the exception condition (N0=2, N2=2). It correctly handled the 0s and 2s blocks. However, it selected the wrong 2x2 block of 1s to change. The code picked the block closest to the grid center (likely (6,6) or tie-breaking to (5,6) or (6,5)), while the expected output modified the block at (7,9). This discrepancy suggests either the rule for selecting the 1s block is not purely centrality *or* the expected output for Example 2 might be inconsistent with the rule implied by Example 3.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine MSB Definition:** Implement a check (`_is_valid_msb`) to ensure that blocks considered for triggering the exception (largest 0-MSB and 2-MSB) are strictly within the non-border area (i.e., do not contain any '3's). This addresses the failure in Example 1.
2.  **Maintain Centrality Rule for 1s Block:** Given that the centrality rule (closest Euclidean distance to grid center, tie-breaking with reading order) worked perfectly for Example 3, we will retain this as the rule for selecting the target 1s block in the exception case. While this leads to a different output for Example 2 compared to the provided expected output, it maintains consistency with the rule derived from Example 3.
3.  **Implement Conditional Logic:** Clearly separate the default transformation (0->1, 2->0 globally) from the exception transformation (triggered by equal-sized, valid, N>=2 MSBs for 0 and 2). The exception overrides the default rule for the cells within the specific 0-MSB, 2-MSB, and target 1-MSB.

| `train_1` | False | 8          | 12x12      | 12x12       | Failed. Applied exception rule. Should apply default rule. Reason: 2-MSB touches border, likely invalidating exception trigger.                 |
| `train_2` | False | 8          | 14x14      | 14x14       | Failed. Applied exception rule. Chose wrong 1s block (centrality chose (6,6)/(5,6)/(6,5) approx, expected (7,9)).                           |
| `train_3` | True  | 0          | 16x16      | 16x16       | Success. Applied exception rule. Centrality correctly identified target 1s block at (6,8).                                                     |

## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a deep copy of the input grid.
2.  Define a function `find_largest_valid_msb(grid, digit)`:
    *   Searches the input grid for monochromatic square blocks (size N>=2) of the specified `digit`.
    *   A block is *valid* if it does not contain any cells with the value '3'.
    *   Return the top-left coordinate and size (N) of the largest valid block found.
    *   If multiple largest valid blocks exist, return the one whose top-left coordinate comes first in reading order.
    *   If no valid block (N>=2) is found, return size N=0 and a null coordinate.
3.  Call `find_largest_valid_msb` for digit '0' to get `(coord0, N0)`.
4.  Call `find_largest_valid_msb` for digit '2' to get `(coord2, N2)`.
5.  **Check Exception Condition:** Determine if `N0 >= 2` AND `N2 >= 2` AND `N0 == N2`.
6.  **If Exception Condition is TRUE:**
    *   Let N = N0.
    *   Define a function `find_all_valid_msb_of_size(grid, digit, size)` that finds all *valid* N x N MSBs of the specified `digit` and returns a list of their top-left coordinates and centers.
    *   Call `find_all_valid_msb_of_size` for digit '1' and size N to get a list `l1_candidates`.
    *   Set `coord1_target` to null initially.
    *   If `l1_candidates` is not empty:
        *   Calculate the grid center coordinates: `center_r = (rows - 1) / 2`, `center_c = (cols - 1) / 2`.
        *   Find the candidate `(coord1, block_center1)` in `l1_candidates` that minimizes the squared Euclidean distance between `block_center1` and the grid center.
        *   If there are ties for minimum distance, choose the candidate whose `coord1` comes first in reading order (this is handled implicitly by iterating through `l1_candidates` in order).
        *   Set `coord1_target` to the `coord1` of the chosen candidate.
    *   **Apply Transformations (Exception Case):**
        *   Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the input grid:
            *   Determine if `(r, c)` is within the N x N block starting at `coord2` (L2_MSB).
            *   Determine if `coord1_target` is not null AND `(r, c)` is within the N x N block starting at `coord1_target` (L1_target).
            *   If the cell is in L2_MSB: Set `output[r][c] = 2`.
            *   Else if the cell is in L1_target: Set `output[r][c] = 0`.
            *   Else (covers L0_MSB and all other cells):
                *   If `input[r][c] == 0`: Set `output[r][c] = 1`.
                *   Else if `input[r][c] == 2`: Set `output[r][c] = 0`.
                *   Else: `output[r][c]` remains the copied `input[r][c]` ('1' or '3').
7.  **If Exception Condition is FALSE:**
    *   **Apply Transformations (Default Case):**
        *   Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the input grid:
            *   If `input[r][c] == 0`: Set `output[r][c] = 1`.
            *   Else if `input[r][c] == 2`: Set `output[r][c] = 0`.
            *   Else: `output[r][c]` remains the copied `input[r][c]` ('1' or '3').
8.  Return the final output grid.
