            "text": "Okay, analyzing the first example pair.\n\n**Initial Perception:**\n\nThe input and output are grids of the same dimensions (7x7). They contain numerical values: 0, 2, 4, and 8. The value 0 appears to be the background. The transformation seems to primarily affect the positions of the number '4', while the numbers '2' and '8' largely retain their positions, specifically those in column 5. The '4's in the input are scattered, while in the output, they form a near-vertical line in column 4 and a single '4' appears at the top of column 5. This suggests a process that relocates or regenerates '4's based on their original positions, possibly relative to the location of the '2'. Some '4's from the input (e.g., at (5,2) and (6,1)) are removed. A new '4' appears at (0,5).\n\n**Observed Facts (YAML):**\n\n```yaml\ntask_type: grid_transformation\ngrid_properties:\n  dimensions: [7, 7]\n  value_set: [0, 1, 2, 4, 8] # Assuming 0 is background\nobjects:\n  - type: number_group\n    value: 2\n    input_location: [[1, 5]]\n    output_location: [[1, 5]]\n    action: preserved\n  - type: number_group\n    value: 8\n    input_location: [[3, 5], [4, 5], [5, 5], [6, 5]]\n    output_location: [[3, 5], [4, 5], [5, 5], [6, 5]]\n    action: preserved\n  - type: number_group\n    value: 4\n    input_location: [[3, 3], [3, 4], [4, 3], [5, 2], [5, 3], [6, 1]]\n    output_location: [[0, 5], [1, 4], [2, 4], [3, 4]]\n    action: complex_relocation_and_generation\nrelationships_and_actions:\n  - relation: column_based_preservation\n    description: Column 5, which contains the '2' and '8's in the input, is entirely preserved in the output.\n  - relation: column_based_transformation\n    description: Values '4' originally in column 3 and column 4 seem to determine the final positions of '4's in column 4 of the output.\n  - relation: conditional_placement\n    description: The '4' from input (5,3) does not appear to translate directly to output (3,4), possibly because output (3,4) is already occupied by the '4' preserved from input (3,4).\n  - relation: element_generation\n    description: A '4' appears at output (0,5), a position that was '0' in the input. This position is at the top of the preserved column 5.\n  - relation: element_removal\n    description: '4's present in input columns 1 and 2 are absent in the output.\n  - relation: potential_anchor\n    description: The column containing '2' (column 5) appears to be an anchor or reference point for the transformation rules affecting the '4's.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program (v1):**\n\n1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background value (0).\n2.  Identify the column index (`col_2`) containing the value `2`.\n3.  Copy all elements from the input's `col_2` to the output's `col_2`.\n4.  Identify the column index immediately to the left (`col_left = col_2 - 1`) and two columns to the left (`col_left_left = col_2 - 2`).\n5.  For each cell in the input grid at `(row, col_left)` containing a `4`, place a `4` at the corresponding `(row, col_left)` position in the output grid.\n6.  For each cell in the input grid at `(row, col_left_left)` containing a `4`:\n    a.  Calculate the target position `(row - 2, col_left)`.\n    b.  If this target position is within the grid boundaries and the corresponding cell in the *output* grid currently holds the background value (0), place a `4` at this target position in the output grid.\n7.  Find the topmost row (`top_row`) where the input grid has a `4` in column `col_left_left`. If such a row exists, place a `4` in the output grid at position `(0, col_2)`.\n8.  Leave all other cells in the output grid as the background value (0)."
