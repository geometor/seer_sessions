relationships_and_actions:
  - relation: column_based_preservation
    description: Column 5, which contains the '2' and '8's in the input, is entirely preserved in the output.
  - relation: column_based_transformation
    description: Values '4' originally in column 3 and column 4 seem to determine the final positions of '4's in column 4 of the output.
  - relation: conditional_placement
    description: The '4' from input (5,3) does not appear to translate directly to output (3,4), possibly because output (3,4) is already occupied by the '4' preserved from input (3,4).
  - relation: element_generation
    description: A '4' appears at output (0,5), a position that was '0' in the input. This position is at the top of the preserved column 5.
  - relation: element_removal
    description: '4's present in input columns 1 and 2 are absent in the output.
  - relation: potential_anchor
    description: The column containing '2' (column 5) appears to be an anchor or reference point for the transformation rules affecting the '4's.
