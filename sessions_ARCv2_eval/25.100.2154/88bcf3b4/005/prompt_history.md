Okay, analyzing the first example pair.

**Initial Perception:**

The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (7x7). They contain numerical values: 0, 2, 4, and 8. The value 0 appears to be the background. The transformation seems to primarily affect the positions of the number '4', while the numbers '2' and '8' largely retain their positions, specifically those in column 5. The '4's in the input are scattered, while in the output, they form a near-vertical line in column 4 and a single '4' appears at the top of column 5. This suggests a process that relocates or regenerates '4's based on their original positions, possibly relative to the location of the '2'. Some '4's from the input (e.g., at (5,2) and (6,1)) are removed. A new '4' appears at (0,5).

**Natural Language Program (v1):**

1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background value (0).
2.  Identify the column index (`col_2`) containing the value `2`.
3.  Copy all elements from the input's `col_2` to the output's `col_2`.
4.  Identify the column index immediately to the left (`col_left = col_2 - 1`) and two columns to the left (`col_left_left = col_2 - 2`).
5.  For each cell in the input grid at `(row, col_left)` containing a `4`, place a `4` at the corresponding `(row, col_left)` position in the output grid.
6.  For each cell in the input grid at `(row, col_left_left)` containing a `4`:
    a.  Calculate the target position `(row - 2, col_left)`.
    b.  If this target position is within the grid boundaries and the corresponding cell in the *output* grid currently holds the background value (0), place a `4` at this target position in the output grid.
7.  Find the topmost row (`top_row`) where the input grid has a `4` in column `col_left_left`. If such a row exists, place a `4` in the output grid at position `(0, col_2)`.
8.  Leave all other cells in the output grid as the background value (0).

**Refined Perception:**

The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions. The transformation rules appear centered around a specific "anchor" column, identifiable by a consistent set of non-background values ('2' and '8' in the first example, '2' in the second). The background color itself varies between examples ('0' vs '7').

Other numbers in the grid behave differently based on their value and their column's position relative to the anchor column:

1.  **Anchor Column:** Values in this column are preserved in the output.
2.  **Static Values:** Some numbers (like '4' in the second example) might exist independently and remain unchanged, regardless of the anchor column or other transformations.
3.  **Mover Values:** Other numbers (like '4' in the first example, '3' in the second) change position based on rules dependent on *both* their specific value *and* their column's distance from the anchor column.
    *   Movers in the column immediately left (relative position -1) of the anchor column either stay put (if value is '4') or move up one row (if value is '3').
    *   Movers in the column two positions left (relative position -2) of the anchor column move right one column and up a number of rows dependent on their value (up 2 if '4', up 1 if '3').
    *   Movers in any other column are removed.
4.  **Collision Handling:** When a move targets a cell already occupied (e.g., by a preserved value from column -1), the move is cancelled. Moves from column -1 seem to have priority over moves from column -2 targeting the same cell.
5.  **Conditional Generation:** A specific condition (mover value '4' combined with successful moves originating from column -2) triggers the placement of a '4' at the top of the anchor column in the output.

The grid dimensions also vary between examples (7x7 vs 12x12), indicating the rules must be independent of a fixed size.

**Updated Natural Language Program (v2):**

1.  Determine the grid dimensions (height `H`, width `W`) and the background color from the input grid.
2.  Create an output grid of dimensions `H`x`W`, initialized with the background color.
3.  Identify the "anchor column" (`anc_c`) by finding the column containing a consistent pattern of specific non-background values (e.g., '2's, or '2's and '8's).
4.  Identify the "mover" value (`M`) for this task (e.g., '4' in example 1, '3' in example 2). Assume only one mover value per task instance.
5.  Identify any "static" values (`S`) that are preserved in place independently (e.g., '4' in example 2, when '3' is the mover).
6.  Copy the identified anchor column (`anc_c`) entirely from the input to the output grid.
7.  Copy all instances of static values (`S`) from their input positions to the same positions in the output grid.
8.  Create two lists to store potential moves for the mover value `M`: `moves_col_minus_1` and `moves_col_minus_2`.
9.  Initialize a flag `made_move_from_minus_2 = false`.
10. Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid:
    a.  If the value `input[r, c]` is the mover value `M`:
        i.  Calculate the relative column `rel_c = c - anc_c`.
        ii. If `rel_c == -1`:
            *   Determine target position `(tr, tc)` based on `M`:
                *   If `M == 4`, target is `(r, c)`.
                *   If `M == 3`, target is `(r - 1, c)`.
            *   Add `(tr, tc)` to `moves_col_minus_1`.
        iii. If `rel_c == -2`:
            *   Determine target position `(tr, tc)` based on `M`:
                *   If `M == 4`, target is `(r - 2, c + 1)`.
                *   If `M == 3`, target is `(r - 1, c + 1)`.
            *   Add `(tr, tc)` to `moves_col_minus_2`.
11. Process moves from `moves_col_minus_1`:
    a.  For each target position `(tr, tc)` in `moves_col_minus_1`:
        i.  If `tr` is within grid bounds (>= 0) and the cell `output[tr, tc]` currently holds the background color, place the mover value `M` at `output[tr, tc]`.
12. Process moves from `moves_col_minus_2`:
    a.  For each target position `(tr, tc)` in `moves_col_minus_2`:
        i.  If `tr` is within grid bounds (>= 0) and the cell `output[tr, tc]` currently holds the background color:
            *   Place the mover value `M` at `output[tr, tc]`.
            *   Set `made_move_from_minus_2 = true`.
13. Apply conditional generation rule:
    a.  If the mover value `M` is '4' *and* `made_move_from_minus_2` is `true`:
        i.  Place '4' at `output[0, anc_c]`, overwriting any existing value.
14. The final `output` grid is the result.

```

**Refined Perception:**

Based on the third example, the transformation logic is more complex and context-dependent than initially hypothesized. The core concepts of an "Anchor Column" (preserved), "Static Objects" (preserved), and a "Mover Object" (transformed) seem valid, but the transformation rules for the Mover depend significantly on its position relative to the Anchor and potentially the presence and position of Static objects.

1.  **Anchor Identification:** The column containing specific, often vertically aligned, non-background values (like '2' or '2' and '8') remains the anchor (`anc_c`), and its contents are copied directly to the output.
2.  **Static Object Identification:** Other non-background, non-anchor objects that do not change position significantly (like the '4's in train_2, '9's in train_3) are identified as Static. They are also copied directly to the output.
3.  **Mover Object Identification:** The remaining non-background color is the Mover (`M`). Its transformation rule appears to depend on whether its input locations are primarily to the LEFT or RIGHT of the anchor column.
4.  **Left-Side Mover Transformation (Train 1 & 2):**
    *   Movers in column `anc_c - 1` are potentially shifted vertically based on the mover color `M` (e.g., `M=4` shift 0, `M=3` shift -1) and placed in the output if the target is background.
    *   Movers in column `anc_c - 2` are potentially shifted vertically (e.g., `M=4` shift -2, `M=3` shift -1) and horizontally (`+1` column) and placed in the output if the target is background.
    *   Collisions are resolved by prioritizing existing output values (Anchor, Static, `anc_c - 1` moves).
    *   A conditional generation rule might apply (e.g., placing a '4' at `(0, anc_c)` if `M=4` and a successful move from `anc_c - 2` occurred).
    *   Movers further left are removed.
5.  **Right-Side Mover Transformation (Train 3):**
    *   Input movers seem largely ignored *except* for one specific case: A mover cell at `(r, anc_c + 1)` that is horizontally aligned with an anchor cell `(r, anc_c)` might be preserved in the output.
    *   A *new shape* is generated using the Mover color `M`. This shape's position and form appear determined by the location of the Static object (`S`) and potentially the single preserved mover cell adjacent to the anchor. In Train 3, this generated shape is a 'V' adjacent to the right side of the Static '9's column.
6.  **General Principles:** The background color and grid dimensions are variable. The specific values used for Anchor, Mover, and Static roles change between examples.

```

**Updated Natural Language Program (v3):**

1.  Determine the grid dimensions (`H`, `W`) and the background color (`B`) from the input grid.
2.  Create an output grid (`out`) of dimensions `H`x`W`, initialized with `B`.
3.  Identify the Anchor object(s) and their column `anc_c`. Copy the column `input[:, anc_c]` to `out[:, anc_c]`.
4.  Identify the Mover color (`M`) and any Static color(s) (`S`) by analyzing non-anchor, non-background values and their change between input and output.
5.  Identify locations of Static objects (`static_S_coords`) in the input. Copy these values to the same locations in `out`. Determine primary column (`static_c`), min/max rows (`min_r_S`, `max_r_S`) if applicable (e.g., for Train 3 '9's).
6.  Find all locations of the Mover color `M` in the input: `input_M_coords`.
7.  Determine if `input_M_coords` are primarily located LEFT (`< anc_c`) or RIGHT (`> anc_c`) of the anchor column.

8.  **IF Mover location is primarily LEFT:**
    a.  Initialize lists `potential_moves_minus_1`, `potential_moves_minus_2`.
    b.  Initialize flag `made_move_from_minus_2 = false`.
    c.  For each `(r, c)` in `input_M_coords`:
        i.  If `c == anc_c - 1`: Calculate target `(tr, tc)` based on `M`'s vertical shift rule for col -1 (e.g., `M=4` -> `(r, c)`, `M=3` -> `(r-1, c)`). Add `(tr, tc)` to `potential_moves_minus_1`.
        ii. If `c == anc_c - 2`: Calculate target `(tr, tc)` based on `M`'s vertical shift rule for col -2 (e.g., `M=4` -> `(r-2, c+1)`, `M=3` -> `(r-1, c+1)`). Add `(tr, tc)` to `potential_moves_minus_2`.
    d.  Process `potential_moves_minus_1`: For each target `(tr, tc)`, if `tr >= 0` and `out[tr, tc] == B`, set `out[tr, tc] = M`.
    e.  Process `potential_moves_minus_2`: For each target `(tr, tc)`, if `tr >= 0` and `out[tr, tc] == B`, set `out[tr, tc] = M` and set `made_move_from_minus_2 = true`.
    f.  Conditional Generation: If `M == 4` and `made_move_from_minus_2`, set `out[0, anc_c] = 4` (overwriting if necessary).

9.  **ELSE IF Mover location is primarily RIGHT:**
    a.  Initialize `preserved_mover_coord = None`.
    b.  For each `(r, c)` in `input_M_coords`:
        i.  If `c == anc_c + 1` and `input[r, anc_c]` is an anchor color: Set `out[r, c] = M`. Store `preserved_mover_coord = (r, c)`. Break loop if only one such preservation expected. (Refinement: Assumes only one is preserved based on Train 3).
    c.  Generate the new Mover shape based on `preserved_mover_coord = (pr, pc)` and Static object properties (`static_c`, `min_r_S`, `max_r_S`):
        i.  **(Segment 1 - Approach):** Define points `(pr+i, pc+i)` for `i` from 1 up to `min_r_S - pr -1`.
        ii. **(Segment 2 - Alongside):** Define points `(min_r_S + i, static_c + 1)` for `i` from 0 up to `max_r_S - min_r_S`.
        iii. **(Segment 3 - Depart):** Define points `(max_r_S + 1 + i, static_c - i)` for `i` from 0 up to `(max_r_S + 1 + i == pr + (pc-(static_c-i)))?`. Simpler: Define points mirroring Segment 1's relative `(dr, dc)`: `(+1, -1)`. Start at `(max_r_S + 1, static_c)`. Generate `(max_r_S + 1 + i, static_c - i)` until the column reaches `pc`.
        iv. For each generated point `(gr, gc)` from segments 1, 2, 3: If `gr, gc` are within bounds and `out[gr, gc] == B`, set `out[gr, gc] = M`.

10. **ELSE (Mover position unclear / mixed / No specific rule matched):**
    a. Copy input `M` locations to output? Or leave as background? (Requires more examples for this case). Assume for now leave as background if no rule applies.

11. Return the final `out` grid.

**Refined Perception:**

The fourth example (`train_4`) reinforces the core concepts identified earlier: Anchor Column, Static Objects, and Mover Objects, but clarifies their interactions and specific transformation rules.

1.  **Anchor Column:** Confirmed. It's a column with specific, preserved non-background value(s) (`5` in `train_4`). Its position determines the relative positions for mover rules.
2.  **Static Objects:** Confirmed (`3` in `train_4`). These are non-anchor, non-mover values preserved in place initially.
3.  **Mover Objects:** Confirmed (`8` in `train_4`). Transformation depends on value (`M`) and relative position to the anchor column (`anc_c`).
    *   **Left-Side Movers (`c < anc_c`):** The specific vertical (`dr`) and horizontal (`dc`) shifts depend on *both* the relative column (`rel_c`) *and* the mover value (`M`).
        *   `M=4`: `rel_c=-1` -> (0, 0); `rel_c=-2` -> (-2, +1)
        *   `M=3`: `rel_c=-1` -> (-1, 0); `rel_c=-2` -> (-1, +1)
        *   `M=8`: `rel_c=-1` -> (-4, 0); `rel_c=-2` -> (-4, +1)
    *   **Right-Side Movers (`c > anc_c`):** Observed only for `M=7` (Train 3), involving preservation of one element adjacent to the anchor and generation of a new shape relative to static objects.
    *   **Movers far from anchor (`|c - anc_c| > 2`):** Removed.
4.  **Collision/Overwrite Priority:** Example `train_4` significantly clarifies this. The final state of a cell seems determined by the *last* action applied to it, with movers potentially overwriting static objects. A likely order is:
    1.  Initialize with background.
    2.  Place Static objects.
    3.  Place Anchor column values.
    4.  Place results of Mover transformations (potentially overwriting Static).
    5.  Place results of Conditional Generation (potentially overwriting previous steps).
5.  **Conditional Generation:** This appears specific to the Mover value and whether successful moves originated from `rel_c = -2` (for left-side movers).
    *   `M=4`: Place `M` at `(0, anc_c)`.
    *   `M=8`: Place `M` at `(0, anc_c - 1)`.
    *   `M=3, M=7`: No equivalent rule observed.

**Updated Natural Language Program (v4):**

1.  Determine the grid dimensions (`H`, `W`) and the background color (`B`) from the input grid (`inp`).
2.  Create an output grid (`out`) of dimensions `H`x`W`, initialized with `B`.
3.  Identify the Anchor object value(s) (`A`) and their column index `anc_c`.
4.  Identify the Mover color (`M`) and any Static color(s) (`S`).
5.  Find all locations `(r, c)` where `inp[r, c]` is a Static color `S`. For each, set `out[r, c] = inp[r, c]`. Store Static object properties (like column `static_c`, `min_r_S`, `max_r_S` for Train 3 '9's) if needed for later steps.
6.  Copy the anchor column: For `r` from 0 to `H-1`, set `out[r, anc_c] = inp[r, anc_c]`.
7.  Find all locations `(r, c)` of the Mover color `M` in the input: `input_M_coords`.
8.  Determine if `input_M_coords` are primarily located LEFT (`< anc_c`) or RIGHT (`> anc_c`) of the anchor column.

9.  **IF Mover location is primarily LEFT:**
    a.  Initialize flag `made_move_from_minus_2 = false`.
    b.  Determine shifts based on `M`:

        *   Else: (Define default/error behavior if M is unknown left-mover)
    c.  Create a list `mover_placements` to store `(target_row, target_col)`.
    d.  For each `(r, c)` in `input_M_coords`:
        i.  If `c == anc_c - 1`: `tr, tc = r + dr1, c + dc1`. Add `(tr, tc)` to `mover_placements`.
        ii. If `c == anc_c - 2`: `tr, tc = r + dr2, c + dc2`. Add `(tr, tc)` to `mover_placements`. Mark that a potential move from col -2 exists.
    e.  Process `mover_placements`: For each `(tr, tc)`:
        i.  If `0 <= tr < H` and `0 <= tc < W`:
            *   Set `out[tr, tc] = M`.
            *   If the source column for this move was `anc_c - 2`, set `made_move_from_minus_2 = true`.
    f.  Apply Conditional Generation:

10. **ELSE IF Mover location is primarily RIGHT (currently only M=7 logic):**
    a.  Initialize `preserved_mover_coord = None`.
    b.  Find the Static object properties (`static_c`, `min_r_S`, `max_r_S` for '9's in Train 3).
    c.  For each `(r, c)` in `input_M_coords`:
        i.  If `c == anc_c + 1` and `inp[r, anc_c]` is an anchor color:

            *   Store `preserved_mover_coord = (r, c)`.

Okay, analyzing the fifth example pair (`train_5`) in the context of the previous four.

**Refined Perception:**

This example strongly confirms the core model of **Anchor**, **Static**, and **Mover** objects interacting within a grid transformation.
-   **Anchor:** Column 5 contains '6's, which are preserved, identifying '6' as the anchor value and column 5 as `anc_c`.
-   **Static:** The '3's in column 3 are preserved, identifying '3' as the static value `S`.
-   **Mover:** The '9's are the mover value `M`. They are primarily located to the left of the anchor column, triggering the "Left-Side Mover" rules.

Key refinements and confirmations from `train_5`:

1.  **Mover Shift Rules Depend on `M`:** The specific `(dr, dc)` shift applied to a mover depends heavily on the mover value `M` and its relative column `rel_c`.
    *   `rel_c = -1`: `train_5` (M=9) shows `(dr, dc) = (0, 0)`. This adds to the pattern: M=4 -> (0,0), M=3 -> (-1,0), M=8 -> (-4,0), M=9 -> (0,0).
    *   `rel_c = -2`: `train_5` (M=9) shows `(dr, dc) = (-2, 0)`. This *breaks* the previous pattern of `dc=+1` for this relative column. The new pattern for `dc` seems to be: `dc = +1` if `M != 9`, else `dc = 0`. The `dr` pattern remains specific to M: M=4 -> -2, M=3 -> -1, M=8 -> -4, M=9 -> -2.
    *   `rel_c = -3`: `train_5` introduces a rule for `rel_c = -3` specifically when `M=9`, with `(dr, dc) = (-5, 0)`. For other M values, movers at `rel_c <= -3` are still removed.
2.  **Conditional Generation Depends on `M`:** The generation of new mover values at the top of the grid (or nearby columns) also depends on `M` and seems triggered by successful moves originating from `rel_c = -2`.
    *   `M=4`: Place `4` at `(0, anc_c)`.
    *   `M=8`: Place `8` at `(0, anc_c - 1)`.
    *   `M=9`: Place `9` at `(0, anc_c - 1)` *and* `(1, anc_c - 1)`.
3.  **Overwrite Logic Confirmed:** The sequential overwrite logic (Background -> Static -> Anchor -> Movers -> Conditional Generation) holds. Movers (`9`) overwrite the background, and the conditional generation (`9`s at `(0,4)` and `(1,4)`) also overwrites the background. Previous examples showed movers overwriting static values.
4.  **Right-Side Rule Unchanged:** This example doesn't involve right-side movers, so the rule derived from `train_3` (M=7) remains unchanged but specific to M=7 for now.
