Okay, analyzing the first example pair.

**Initial Perception:**

The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (7x7). They contain numerical values: 0, 2, 4, and 8. The value 0 appears to be the background. The transformation seems to primarily affect the positions of the number '4', while the numbers '2' and '8' largely retain their positions, specifically those in column 5. The '4's in the input are scattered, while in the output, they form a near-vertical line in column 4 and a single '4' appears at the top of column 5. This suggests a process that relocates or regenerates '4's based on their original positions, possibly relative to the location of the '2'. Some '4's from the input (e.g., at (5,2) and (6,1)) are removed. A new '4' appears at (0,5).

**Natural Language Program (v1):**

1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background value (0).
2.  Identify the column index (`col_2`) containing the value `2`.
3.  Copy all elements from the input's `col_2` to the output's `col_2`.
4.  Identify the column index immediately to the left (`col_left = col_2 - 1`) and two columns to the left (`col_left_left = col_2 - 2`).
5.  For each cell in the input grid at `(row, col_left)` containing a `4`, place a `4` at the corresponding `(row, col_left)` position in the output grid.
6.  For each cell in the input grid at `(row, col_left_left)` containing a `4`:
    a.  Calculate the target position `(row - 2, col_left)`.
    b.  If this target position is within the grid boundaries and the corresponding cell in the *output* grid currently holds the background value (0), place a `4` at this target position in the output grid.
7.  Find the topmost row (`top_row`) where the input grid has a `4` in column `col_left_left`. If such a row exists, place a `4` in the output grid at position `(0, col_2)`.
8.  Leave all other cells in the output grid as the background value (0).

**Refined Perception:**

The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions. The transformation rules appear centered around a specific "anchor" column, identifiable by a consistent set of non-background values ('2' and '8' in the first example, '2' in the second). The background color itself varies between examples ('0' vs '7').

Other numbers in the grid behave differently based on their value and their column's position relative to the anchor column:

1.  **Anchor Column:** Values in this column are preserved in the output.
2.  **Static Values:** Some numbers (like '4' in the second example) might exist independently and remain unchanged, regardless of the anchor column or other transformations.
3.  **Mover Values:** Other numbers (like '4' in the first example, '3' in the second) change position based on rules dependent on *both* their specific value *and* their column's distance from the anchor column.
    *   Movers in the column immediately left (relative position -1) of the anchor column either stay put (if value is '4') or move up one row (if value is '3').
    *   Movers in the column two positions left (relative position -2) of the anchor column move right one column and up a number of rows dependent on their value (up 2 if '4', up 1 if '3').
    *   Movers in any other column are removed.
4.  **Collision Handling:** When a move targets a cell already occupied (e.g., by a preserved value from column -1), the move is cancelled. Moves from column -1 seem to have priority over moves from column -2 targeting the same cell.
5.  **Conditional Generation:** A specific condition (mover value '4' combined with successful moves originating from column -2) triggers the placement of a '4' at the top of the anchor column in the output.

The grid dimensions also vary between examples (7x7 vs 12x12), indicating the rules must be independent of a fixed size.

**Updated Natural Language Program (v2):**

1.  Determine the grid dimensions (height `H`, width `W`) and the background color from the input grid.
2.  Create an output grid of dimensions `H`x`W`, initialized with the background color.
3.  Identify the "anchor column" (`anc_c`) by finding the column containing a consistent pattern of specific non-background values (e.g., '2's, or '2's and '8's).
4.  Identify the "mover" value (`M`) for this task (e.g., '4' in example 1, '3' in example 2). Assume only one mover value per task instance.
5.  Identify any "static" values (`S`) that are preserved in place independently (e.g., '4' in example 2, when '3' is the mover).
6.  Copy the identified anchor column (`anc_c`) entirely from the input to the output grid.
7.  Copy all instances of static values (`S`) from their input positions to the same positions in the output grid.
8.  Create two lists to store potential moves for the mover value `M`: `moves_col_minus_1` and `moves_col_minus_2`.
9.  Initialize a flag `made_move_from_minus_2 = false`.
10. Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid:
    a.  If the value `input[r, c]` is the mover value `M`:
        i.  Calculate the relative column `rel_c = c - anc_c`.
        ii. If `rel_c == -1`:
            *   Determine target position `(tr, tc)` based on `M`:
                *   If `M == 4`, target is `(r, c)`.
                *   If `M == 3`, target is `(r - 1, c)`.
            *   Add `(tr, tc)` to `moves_col_minus_1`.
        iii. If `rel_c == -2`:
            *   Determine target position `(tr, tc)` based on `M`:
                *   If `M == 4`, target is `(r - 2, c + 1)`.
                *   If `M == 3`, target is `(r - 1, c + 1)`.
            *   Add `(tr, tc)` to `moves_col_minus_2`.
11. Process moves from `moves_col_minus_1`:
    a.  For each target position `(tr, tc)` in `moves_col_minus_1`:
        i.  If `tr` is within grid bounds (>= 0) and the cell `output[tr, tc]` currently holds the background color, place the mover value `M` at `output[tr, tc]`.
12. Process moves from `moves_col_minus_2`:
    a.  For each target position `(tr, tc)` in `moves_col_minus_2`:
        i.  If `tr` is within grid bounds (>= 0) and the cell `output[tr, tc]` currently holds the background color:
            *   Place the mover value `M` at `output[tr, tc]`.
            *   Set `made_move_from_minus_2 = true`.
13. Apply conditional generation rule:
    a.  If the mover value `M` is '4' *and* `made_move_from_minus_2` is `true`:
        i.  Place '4' at `output[0, anc_c]`, overwriting any existing value.
14. The final `output` grid is the result.
