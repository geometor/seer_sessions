            "text": "**Refined Perception:**\n\nBased on the third example, the transformation logic is more complex and context-dependent than initially hypothesized. The core concepts of an \"Anchor Column\" (preserved), \"Static Objects\" (preserved), and a \"Mover Object\" (transformed) seem valid, but the transformation rules for the Mover depend significantly on its position relative to the Anchor and potentially the presence and position of Static objects.\n\n1.  **Anchor Identification:** The column containing specific, often vertically aligned, non-background values (like '2' or '2' and '8') remains the anchor (`anc_c`), and its contents are copied directly to the output.\n2.  **Static Object Identification:** Other non-background, non-anchor objects that do not change position significantly (like the '4's in train_2, '9's in train_3) are identified as Static. They are also copied directly to the output.\n3.  **Mover Object Identification:** The remaining non-background color is the Mover (`M`). Its transformation rule appears to depend on whether its input locations are primarily to the LEFT or RIGHT of the anchor column.\n4.  **Left-Side Mover Transformation (Train 1 & 2):**\n    *   Movers in column `anc_c - 1` are potentially shifted vertically based on the mover color `M` (e.g., `M=4` shift 0, `M=3` shift -1) and placed in the output if the target is background.\n    *   Movers in column `anc_c - 2` are potentially shifted vertically (e.g., `M=4` shift -2, `M=3` shift -1) and horizontally (`+1` column) and placed in the output if the target is background.\n    *   Collisions are resolved by prioritizing existing output values (Anchor, Static, `anc_c - 1` moves).\n    *   A conditional generation rule might apply (e.g., placing a '4' at `(0, anc_c)` if `M=4` and a successful move from `anc_c - 2` occurred).\n    *   Movers further left are removed.\n5.  **Right-Side Mover Transformation (Train 3):**\n    *   Input movers seem largely ignored *except* for one specific case: A mover cell at `(r, anc_c + 1)` that is horizontally aligned with an anchor cell `(r, anc_c)` might be preserved in the output.\n    *   A *new shape* is generated using the Mover color `M`. This shape's position and form appear determined by the location of the Static object (`S`) and potentially the single preserved mover cell adjacent to the anchor. In Train 3, this generated shape is a 'V' adjacent to the right side of the Static '9's column.\n6.  **General Principles:** The background color and grid dimensions are variable. The specific values used for Anchor, Mover, and Static roles change between examples.\n\n**Updated YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_type: grid_transformation\ngrid_properties:\n  variable_dimensions: true # Examples: 7x7, 12x12, 17x17\n  variable_background: true # Examples: 0, 7, 1\n  value_set: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9] # Combined from examples\nobject_roles:\n  - role: anchor\n    values_observed: [[2, 8], [2], [2]] # Per example\n    behavior: Located in a single column (anc_c). Preserved in place in the output.\n  - role: mover\n    values_observed: [4, 3, 7] # Per example\n    behavior: Transformation depends on relative position to anchor (left/right) and potentially static objects.\n    left_rules: # Apply if mover coords are mostly < anc_c\n      - relative_column: -1\n        action: Vertical shift (value-dependent), horizontal shift 0. Place if target is background.\n      - relative_column: -2\n        action: Vertical shift (value-dependent), horizontal shift +1. Place if target is background.

Store location (pr, pc).\n      - removal_rule: Remove other input mover locations.\n      - generation_rule: Generate a new shape using mover color, positioned relative to static object(s) and potentially (pr, pc). (e.g., Train 3 'V' shape relative to static '9's column and (6,7)).\n  - role: static\n    values_observed: [null, [4], [9]] # Per example\n    behavior: Preserved in place in the output. May act as reference points for mover generation.\ncollision_resolution:\n  priority:\n    - Anchor column preservation\n    - Static value preservation\n    - Mover transformations (left: col -1 > col -2; right: preserved > generated?) - Needs refinement.\n  mechanism: If a target cell for a lower-priority action is already occupied, the action is cancelled or overwritten based on exact rules.\n```\n\n**Updated Natural Language Program (v3):**\n\n1.  Determine the grid dimensions (`H`, `W`) and the background color (`B`) from the input grid.\n2.  Create an output grid (`out`) of dimensions `H`x`W`, initialized with `B`.\n3.  Identify the Anchor object(s) and their column `anc_c`. Copy the column `input[:, anc_c]` to `out[:, anc_c]`.\n4.  Identify the Mover color (`M`) and any Static color(s) (`S`) by analyzing non-anchor, non-background values and their change between input and output.\n5.  Identify locations of Static objects (`static_S_coords`) in the input. Copy these values to the same locations in `out`. Determine primary column (`static_c`), min/max rows (`min_r_S`, `max_r_S`) if applicable (e.g., for Train 3 '9's).\n6.  Find all locations of the Mover color `M` in the input: `input_M_coords`.\n7.  Determine if `input_M_coords` are primarily located LEFT (`< anc_c`) or RIGHT (`> anc_c`) of the anchor column.\n\n8.  **IF Mover location is primarily LEFT:**\n    a.  Initialize lists `potential_moves_minus_1`, `potential_moves_minus_2`.\n    b.  Initialize flag `made_move_from_minus_2 = false`.\n    c.  For each `(r, c)` in `input_M_coords`:\n        i.  If `c == anc_c - 1`: Calculate target `(tr, tc)` based on `M`'s vertical shift rule for col -1 (e.g., `M=4` -> `(r, c)`, `M=3` -> `(r-1, c)`). Add `(tr, tc)` to `potential_moves_minus_1`.\n        ii. If `c == anc_c - 2`: Calculate target `(tr, tc)` based on `M`'s vertical shift rule for col -2 (e.g., `M=4` -> `(r-2, c+1)`, `M=3` -> `(r-1, c+1)`). Add `(tr, tc)` to `potential_moves_minus_2`.\n    d.  Process `potential_moves_minus_1`: For each target `(tr, tc)`, if `tr >= 0` and `out[tr, tc] == B`, set `out[tr, tc] = M`.\n    e.  Process `potential_moves_minus_2`: For each target `(tr, tc)`, if `tr >= 0` and `out[tr, tc] == B`, set `out[tr, tc] = M` and set `made_move_from_minus_2 = true`.\n    f.  Conditional Generation: If `M == 4` and `made_move_from_minus_2`, set `out[0, anc_c] = 4` (overwriting if necessary).\n\n9.  **ELSE IF Mover location is primarily RIGHT:**\n    a.  Initialize `preserved_mover_coord = None`.\n    b.  For each `(r, c)` in `input_M_coords`:\n        i.  If `c == anc_c + 1` and `input[r, anc_c]` is an anchor color: Set `out[r, c] = M`. Store `preserved_mover_coord = (r, c)`. Break loop if only one such preservation expected. (Refinement: Assumes only one is preserved based on Train 3).\n    c.  Generate the new Mover shape based on `preserved_mover_coord = (pr, pc)` and Static object properties (`static_c`, `min_r_S`, `max_r_S`):\n        i.  **(Segment 1 - Approach):** Define points `(pr+i, pc+i)` for `i` from 1 up to `min_r_S - pr -1`.\n        ii. **(Segment 2 - Alongside):** Define points `(min_r_S + i, static_c + 1)` for `i` from 0 up to `max_r_S - min_r_S`.\n        iii. **(Segment 3 - Depart):** Define points `(max_r_S + 1 + i, static_c - i)` for `i` from 0 up to `(max_r_S + 1 + i == pr + (pc-(static_c-i)))?`. Simpler: Define points mirroring Segment 1's relative `(dr, dc)`: `(+1, -1)`. Start at `(max_r_S + 1, static_c)`. Generate `(max_r_S + 1 + i, static_c - i)` until the column reaches `pc`.\n        iv. For each generated point `(gr, gc)` from segments 1, 2, 3: If `gr, gc` are within bounds and `out[gr, gc] == B`, set `out[gr, gc] = M`.\n\n10. **ELSE (Mover position unclear / mixed / No specific rule matched):**\n    a. Copy input `M` locations to output? Or leave as background? (Requires more examples for this case). Assume for now leave as background if no rule applies.\n\n11. Return the final `out` grid."
