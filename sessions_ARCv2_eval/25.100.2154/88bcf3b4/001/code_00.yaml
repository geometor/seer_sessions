task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  variable_dimensions: true # Example 1: 7x7, Example 2: 12x12
  variable_background: true # Example 1: 0, Example 2: 7
  value_set: [0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8] # Combined from examples
anchor_column_behavior:
  identification: Contains a consistent set of non-background values (e.g., [2, 8] or [2]).
  action: Preserve all values in this column in the output.
value_specific_behaviors:
  - value: 4 # Based on train_1 (as mover) and train_2 (as static)
    roles: [mover, static]
    static_behavior: # Observed in train_2
      condition: If not acting as a mover relative to an anchor column.
      action: Preserve original position.
    mover_behavior: # Observed in train_1
      condition: If identified as the primary mover value relative to the anchor column.
      rules:
        - relative_column: -1 # One column left of anchor
          action: Preserve position (move up 0, right 0).
        - relative_column: -2 # Two columns left of anchor
          action: Move up 2 rows, right 1 column.
        - relative_column: other
          action: Remove.
      generation_trigger: # Observed in train_1
        condition: At least one successful move occurred from relative_column -2.
        action: Place '4' at row 0 of the anchor column.
  - value: 3 # Based on train_2 (as mover)
    roles: [mover]
    mover_behavior:
      condition: If identified as the primary mover value relative to the anchor column.
      rules:
        - relative_column: -1 # One column left of anchor
          action: Move up 1 row, right 0 columns.
        - relative_column: -2 # Two columns left of anchor
          action: Move up 1 row, right 1 column.
        - relative_column: other
          action: Remove.
  - value: [2, 8] # Based on train_1 and train_2 (as anchor components)
    roles: [anchor]
    anchor_behavior:
      action: Define the anchor column; preserve position within that column.
collision_resolution:
  priority:
    - Anchor column preservation
    - Static value preservation
    - Mover transformations from relative_column -1
    - Mover transformations from relative_column -2
  mechanism: If a target cell for a lower-priority move is already occupied, the move is cancelled.
