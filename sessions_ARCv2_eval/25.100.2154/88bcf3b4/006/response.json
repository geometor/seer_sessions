            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code successfully identified the core concepts of Anchor, Static, and Mover objects and captured the general transformation patterns for both left-side and right-side movers seen in the training examples. The perfect matches on Examples 1 and 3 demonstrate the fundamental logic for M=4 (left) and M=7 (right) is sound.\n\nHowever, failures on Examples 2, 4, and 5 indicate issues primarily related to:\n\n1.  **Role Ambiguity/Context:** The value '4' acts as a Mover in Example 1 but as Static in Example 2. The current `identify_roles` heuristic (Mover = most frequent non-anchor/non-bg) correctly identifies '3' as the mover in Example 2, implicitly making '4' static. However, the *placement* logic in the code might not be correctly handling the interaction between the placed movers ('3') and the pre-existing static objects ('4').\n2.  **Overwrite/Collision Logic:** The discrepancies in Examples 2, 4, and 5 suggest the precise rules for what happens when a Mover transformation targets a cell already occupied by a Static object need refinement. Example 4 shows movers ('8') overwriting static ('3'), while Example 2 *seems* to show movers ('3') being placed *next to* or *around* static ('4'). Example 5 also shows movers ('9') overwriting static ('3'). The sequential overwrite implemented (Static -> Anchor -> Mover -> Conditional Gen) might need adjustment or more nuanced collision rules. Specifically, the mover placement step must correctly handle pre-existing static values.\n3.  **Mover Shift Specificity:** While the general shifts were captured, the exact `(dr, dc)` values or conditions might be slightly off, particularly for M=3, M=8, and M=9, leading to misplaced pixels.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Re-examine the failed examples (2, 4, 5) pixel by pixel, comparing input, expected output, and the code's actual output.\n2.  Focus on the cells where the actual output differs from the expected output. Determine if the error originates from incorrect static placement, incorrect anchor placement, incorrect mover calculation/placement, or incorrect conditional generation.\n3.  Refine the `identify_roles` logic if necessary, although it seems generally correct based on frequency. The issue is more likely in how static objects are handled *after* identification.\n4.  Adjust the Mover placement logic (step 9f in the Natural Language Program v5) to explicitly check the `out` grid's value *before* placing the mover `M`. The current code overwrites unconditionally. The rule might be: place `M` only if the target cell `out[tr, tc]` contains the Background color `B`. This would prevent movers from overwriting Static or Anchor values placed in earlier steps.\n5.  Re-verify the conditional generation trigger and placement coordinates for M=8 and M=9.\n6.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect these refined rules.\n\n**Metrics from Code Execution:**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# --- Mock code_execution environment ---\n# Assume previous code (helpers + transform) is loaded\n# Assume inputs and expected outputs are available as lists of lists:\n# train_1_input, train_1_output_expected, ... train_5_output_expected\n\n# --- Re-run Transformation and Gather Metrics ---\n\nresults = []\nall_inputs = [train_1_input, train_2_input, train_3_input, train_4_input, train_5_input]\nall_expected = [train_1_output_expected, train_2_output_expected, train_3_output_expected, train_4_output_expected, train_5_output_expected]\n\nfor i, (inp, expected) in enumerate(zip(all_inputs, all_expected)):\n    example_num = i + 1\n    actual_list = transform(inp)\n    actual = np.array(actual_list, dtype=int)\n    expected_np = np.array(expected, dtype=int)\n\n    match = np.array_equal(actual, expected_np)\n    pixels_off = np.sum(actual != expected_np)\n    size_correct = actual.shape == expected_np.shape\n    \n    palette_actual = set(np.unique(actual))\n    palette_expected = set(np.unique(expected_np))\n    palette_correct = palette_actual == palette_expected\n\n    counts_actual = Counter(actual.flatten())\n    counts_expected = Counter(expected_np.flatten())\n    count_correct = counts_actual == counts_expected\n    \n    # Detailed difference analysis (for failed cases)\n    diff_coords = []\n    diff_info = []\n    if not match:\n        diff_indices = np.argwhere(actual != expected_np)\n        for r, c in diff_indices:\n            diff_coords.append((r,c))\n            diff_info.append({\n                'coord': (r, c), \n                'input': int(inp[r][c]), \n                'expected': int(expected_np[r, c]), \n                'actual': int(actual[r, c])\n            })\n            \n    results.append({\n        \"example\": example_num,\n        \"match\": match,\n        \"pixels_off\": int(pixels_off),\n        \"size_correct\": size_correct,\n        \"palette_correct\": palette_correct,\n        \"count_correct\": count_correct,\n        \"diff_coords\": diff_coords,\n        \"diff_info\": diff_info\n    })\n\n# --- Print Summary Metrics ---\n# print(results) \n# Example Output (based on the provided execution results):\n\n# Example 1: Match=True, Pixels Off=0\n# Example 2: Match=False, Pixels Off=6\n#   Diff Coords: [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 5)]\n#   Diff Info:\n#     (1,3): In=7, Exp=3, Act=7 -> Mover '3' expected, not placed.

Code got 7.\n#   Analysis Ex2: The code seems to be incorrectly handling collisions or placements. Static '4' is preserved correctly. Anchor '2' is preserved correctly. The mover '3' placements are wrong. It seems movers should NOT overwrite static or anchor values. Let's re-evaluate the expected output: 3s appear at (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6). Sources: (8,3)->(7,4)? No, (-1,+1) -> (7,4) -> expected=7? No. (8,4)->(7,5)? Yes, blocked by anchor 2. (5,6)->(4,6)? No, expected=7. (6,6)->(5,6)? Yes, expected=3. (7,6)->(6,6)? Yes, expected=7.

This contradicts the left-mover logic completely.\n#   Let's reconsider Ex2 roles. Anchor=7 (col 7, val 2). What if Static=3 AND Static=4? Mover=None? Then output should match input except for anchor col. Doesn't match. What if Anchor=4 (col 4, val 4)? Mover=3? Static=None? Anchor col 4 not preserved.\n#   Hypothesis for Ex2: Anchor=col 7 (val 2). Static=col 4 (val 4). Mover=3. The rules are different. Maybe it relates to the *shape* of the static object? The static 4s are a vertical line. The mover 3s form shapes relative to it? This seems overly complex.\n#   Let's stick to simpler fix: Movers don't overwrite non-background. Rerun trace:\n#   Rel -1: (5,6)->(4,6). Out=BG. Place 3. (6,6)->(5,6). Out=BG. Place 3. (7,6)->(6,6). Out=BG. Place 3.\n#   Rel -2: (6,5)->(5,6). Out=3. No change. (7,5)->(6,6). Out=3. No change. (8,4)->(7,5). Out=2(Anchor). Blocked.\n#   Final state with this rule: 3s at (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). Still doesn't match expected.\n#   There must be a different rule for M=3, or the static '4' influences the '3' movement differently. The expected output shows 3s appearing in col 3 and col 4 & 5. This is very confusing.

OK.\n#   Cond Gen: flag_minus_2=True. Place 8 at (0, anc_c-1) = (0, 3). Out=8. OK.\n#   Hypothesis: Movers DO NOT overwrite Static or Anchor values. Let's recalculate Ex4 based on this:\n#   Rel -1: (4,3)->(0,3). Out=BG. Place 8. (5,3)->(1,3). Out=3(Static). BLOCKED. Expected=3. Actual(new)=3. MATCHES EXPECTED NOW.\n#   Rel -2: (6,2)->(2,3).

Actual(new)=8. OK.\n#   Cond Gen: Place 8 at (0, 3). OK.\n#   The remaining mismatch is at (2,3). Why is 8 placed there in code, but expected is 0? Source was (6,2). Move=(-4,+1). Target=(2,3). Is the shift wrong for M=8, rel=-2?\n#   Let's re-examine Expected Ex4: 8s at (0,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2), (4,3). Where are these coming from? This doesn't match the simple shift logic well.\n#   Could the Static '3's *also* be moving? If 3 is Mover and 8 is Static? Fails frequency test.\n#   What if the rule depends on the *value* being overwritten? Mover overwrites BG, but not Static/Anchor?\n#   Let's assume the \"No overwrite\" rule is correct. The code placed 8 at (2,3) from (6,2). Expected is 0. This implies the move from (6,2) should not have happened or targeted a different place.\n# Example 5: Match=False, Pixels Off=3\n#   Diff Coords: [(2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 3)]\n#   Diff Info:\n#     (2,2): In=0(BG), Exp=9(Mover), Act=0 -> Mover expected, not placed.\n#     (3,2): In=0(BG), Exp=9(Mover), Act=0 -> Mover expected, not placed.\n#     (4,3): In=0(BG), Exp=9(Mover), Act=0 -> Mover expected, not placed.\n#   Analysis Ex5: Anchor=col 5 (val 6).

OK.\n#   Why are (2,2), (3,2), (4,3) wrong? Code calculates targets (2,2) [from (7,2), rel=-3] and (4,3) [from (6,3), rel=-2]. It seems they *should* be placed. Why are they 0 in the actual output? Is there an intermediate step overwriting them? No. Did the code fail to place them? Let's re-check the code logic: It adds to `mover_placements` then iterates. It *should* place them.\n#   What is expected at (3,2)? Where could that 9 come from? No input 9 maps there with current rules.\n#   This implies the rules for M=9 shifts (rel=-2, rel=-3) are incorrect, or the \"No Overwrite\" rule needs more nuance.\n#   Let's reconsider the \"No Overwrite\" rule globally. It fixes parts of Ex4 but breaks Ex5 and doesn't fix Ex2.\n#   What if the Mover Placement step *first* clears all current Mover locations in `out` to Background, *then* places the new locations (only onto Background)?\n\n# --- Final Strategy Revision ---\n# 1. Implement the \"Movers Only Place on Background\" rule. This seems the most promising single change based on Ex4 partial fix.\n# 2. Re-evaluate Ex2 and Ex5 after this change. If still incorrect, the specific shifts `(dr, dc)` for M=3 and M=9 must be wrong.\n# 3. Ex2 is the most problematic. The expected output doesn't fit the established left-mover shift pattern well. There might be a specific rule for M=3 interacting with Static objects, or a completely different paradigm for M=3. Given time constraints, focus on fixing the overwrite logic and assume M=3 might remain an anomaly.\n# 4.
