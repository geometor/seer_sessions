**General Assessment:**

The analysis reveals that the core concept of Anchor, Static, and Mover objects with sequential placement is largely correct and handles several examples well (Ex 1, Ex 3). The introduction of the "Movers/Generation Only Place on Background" rule in the previous iteration (code_01 / NL Program v6) correctly handled collisions observed in Example 4.

However, discrepancies remain, primarily:
1.  **Example 2 (M=3):** The expected output pattern for the mover '3' does not align with the established left-mover shift rules derived from other examples (M=4, 8, 9). This suggests either M=3 follows a unique rule (possibly related to the static '4's shape/position) or the general model needs further refinement.
2.  **Example 4 (M=8):** While the "Place on Background" rule prevents movers from incorrectly overwriting static elements, the code still produces an output mismatch. The code places an '8' where none is expected, and the expected output contains '8's in locations not predicted by the current shift rules. This points to inaccuracies in the specific `(dr, dc)` shifts defined for M=8 or an incomplete understanding of its behavior.
3.  **Example 5 (M=9):** The code is very close but misses placing one '9' pixel compared to the expected output. This suggests the shift rules for M=9 are mostly correct but might need a slight adjustment (specifically the `rel_c = -3` shift).

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine M=9 Shift:** Adjust the vertical shift (`dr`) for M=9 movers at `rel_c = -3` based on the discrepancy in Example 5. The previous value (-5) seems too large; changing it to -4 might place the missing pixel correctly.
2.  **Maintain Overwrite Rule:** Continue using the rule that Mover transformations and Conditional Generation only place their color onto cells currently holding the Background color in the output grid. Static and Anchor placements still overwrite freely.
3.  **Acknowledge Anomalies:** Explicitly note that the current model struggles to fully explain the behavior in Example 2 (M=3) and Example 4 (M=8). The defined shifts for M=8 will be maintained, but the remaining discrepancy in Ex4 will be noted. Ex2's deviation from the left-mover pattern will also be highlighted. A perfect fit for all examples might require case-specific rules beyond the general model identified.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and Natural Language program to reflect the refined M=9 shift and reiterate the "Place on Background" constraint for movers and conditional generation.

**Code Execution Analysis (Based on code_01 / NL v6 results):**

*   **Example 1 (M=4, A={2,8}, S=None):** Perfect Match. Rules work.
*   **Example 2 (M=3, S={4}, A={2}):** Failed (6 pixels off).
    *   `diff_info`: Code correctly places Static '4's and Anchor '2's. Code places Mover '3's at (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) based on shifts `dr1=-1, dc1=0` (applied to input at (5,6),(6,6),(7,6)) and `dr2=-1, dc2=1` (targets (5,6), (6,6), (7,5)[blocked]). Expected '3's are at (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6).
    *   `Analysis`: Major discrepancy. The expected pattern does not match the left-mover shift model. The model likely doesn't apply or needs significant modification for M=3 in this context.
*   **Example 3 (M=7, S={9}, A={2}):** Perfect Match. Right-mover M=7 rule works, including V-shape generation placing only on background (relative to Static S=9).
*   **Example 4 (M=8, S={3}, A={5}):** Failed (4 pixels off).
    *   `diff_info`:
        *   (1,2): Exp=8, Act=0. Mover 8 expected, not placed.
        *   (1,3): Exp=3, Act=3. Static 3 correctly preserved (not overwritten by mover targeting here). OK.
        *   (2,1): Exp=8, Act=0. Mover 8 expected, not placed.
        *   (2,3): Exp=0, Act=8. Mover 8 placed [from (6,2)], but not expected.
        *   (3,2): Exp=8, Act=0. Mover 8 expected, not placed.
        *   (3,3): Exp=3, Act=3. Static 3 correctly preserved. OK.
    *   `Analysis`: "Place on Background" rule works for static preservation. However, code places an unexpected 8 at (2,3) [from (6,2), target was BG]. Expected output has 8s at (1,2), (2,1), (3,2) not generated by code. This indicates the M=8 shift rules (`dr1=-4, dc1=0`, `dr2=-4, dc2=1`) are likely incorrect or incomplete.
*   **Example 5 (M=9, S={3}, A={6}):** Failed (3 pixels off -> should be 1 pixel off based on detailed trace).
    *   `diff_info` (Corrected based on trace):
        *   (3,2): Exp=9, Act=0. Mover 9 expected, not placed.
    *   `Analysis`: Code correctly places 9s from rel=-1 [(5,4)->(5,4)], rel=-2 [(6,3)->(4,3)], and Cond Gen [(0,4), (1,4)]. It also calculates rel=-3 move [(7,2)->(2,2)] and places it. The only missing pixel is (3,2). If the rel=-3 shift `dr` was -4 instead of -5, then (7,2) -> (3,2). This seems like the likely fix.

**Updated YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  variable_dimensions: true
  variable_background: true # Identified as most frequent color
  value_set: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
object_roles:
  - role: anchor
    identification: Column (anc_c) with specific non-background values (anchor_vals), often known patterns [{2, 8}, {2}, {5}, {6}] or single consistent value. Priority given to known patterns.
    behavior: Preserved in place in the output. Overwrites initial background and static values in its column.
  - role: static
    identification: Non-background, non-anchor colors (S). Can include colors that act as movers in other examples.
    behavior: Copied from input to output initially. Overwrites initial background. Does *not* get overwritten by movers or conditional/shape generation. May serve as reference for right-side (M=7) generation.
  - role: mover
    identification: Most frequent non-background, non-anchor color (M).
    behavior: Transformation depends on Mover value (M) and relative position to anchor (left/right). Resulting placements only overwrite background cells.
    left_rules: # Apply if input M coords are mostly < anc_c
      - relative_column: -1
        action: Calculate target (r+dr, c+dc) using M-specific shift (dr1(M), 0). Place M at target if valid coords and target cell is background.
            # dr1: M=4->0, M=3->-1, M=8->-4, M=9->0
      - relative_column: -2
        action: Calculate target (r+dr, c+dc) using M-specific shift (dr2(M), dc2(M)). Place M at target if valid coords and target cell is background. Track success flag_minus_2 if placement occurs.
            # dr2: M=4->-2, M=3->-1, M=8->-4, M=9->-2
            # dc2: M=9->0, else +1
      - relative_column: -3
        action: If M=9, calculate target (r-4, c+0). Place M at target if valid coords and target cell is background. Else (M!=9 or rel_c != -3) remove. # Adjusted dr from -5 to -4
      - relative_column: <-3 (and not M=9, rel=-3)
        action: Remove.
      - conditional_generation: If flag_minus_2 is true: Attempt to place M at specific coords, only if target cell is background.
          # M=4: Target (0, anc_c).
          # M=8: Target (0, anc_c - 1).
          # M=9: Targets (0, anc_c - 1) AND (1, anc_c - 1).
    right_rules: # Apply if input M coords are mostly > anc_c (Observed only for M=7)
      - preservation_rule: Preserve M=7 at (r, anc_c + 1) if input(r, anc_c) is anchor. Place M=7 at this coord in output (overwrites background/static). Store location (pr, pc).
      - removal_rule: Other input M=7 locations are effectively removed.
      - generation_rule: Generate 'V' shape using M=7, positioned relative to static object S=9 properties and (pr, pc). Place M=7 at shape coords if target cell is background.
anomaly_notes:
  - Mover=3 (Ex2): Expected output pattern does not match the standard left-mover shift rules. The implemented code will likely fail this example as the required transformation seems unique to this case.
  - Mover=8 (Ex4): While the "Place on Background" rule prevents static overwrite, the expected output contains mover pixels not predicted by the current shift rules, and the code places one mover pixel not present in the expected output. The specific shift rules for M=8 might be incorrect or incomplete.
overwrite_logic:
  order:
    1. Background Initialization
    2. Static Placement (overwrites background)
    3. Anchor Placement (overwrites background/static)
    4. Mover Transformation Placement (only overwrites background)
    5. Conditional/Shape Generation Placement (only overwrites background)
```

**Updated Natural Language Program (v7):**

1.  Determine grid dimensions (`H`, `W`) and background color (`B`, the most frequent color) from the input grid (`inp`).
2.  Create an output grid (`out`) of dimensions `H`x`W`, initialized with `B`.
3.  Identify the Anchor column index `anc_c` and Anchor value(s) (`A`) using heuristics (known patterns, column consistency). If no anchor is found, return the background grid.
4.  Identify the Mover color (`M`, the most frequent non-anchor/non-background color) and Static color(s) (`S`, all other non-anchor/non-background colors).
5.  **Static Placement:** Find all input locations `(r, c)` of Static colors `S`. Set `out[r, c] = inp[r, c]`. If `M=7`, specifically find properties (column, min/max row) of Static color `9` if present.
6.  **Anchor Placement:** Copy the anchor column: For `r` from 0 to `H-1`, set `out[r, anc_c] = inp[r, anc_c]`. (This overwrites any static values previously placed in that column).
7.  If no Mover color `M` was identified, return the `out` grid.
8.  Find all input locations `(r, c)` of the Mover color `M`: `input_M_coords`. If none exist, return the `out` grid.
9.  Determine if `input_M_coords` represent a LEFT-side mover pattern (average column < `anc_c`) or a RIGHT-side mover pattern (average column > `anc_c`, currently only handled for M=7).

10. **IF Mover location is primarily LEFT:**
    a.  Initialize `flag_minus_2 = false`.
    b.  Define M-dependent shifts:
        *   `rel_c = -1`: `(dr, dc) = (dr1_map[M], 0)` where `dr1_map = {4: 0, 3: -1, 8: -4, 9: 0}` (default 0).
        *   `rel_c = -2`: `(dr, dc) = (dr2_map[M], dc2)` where `dr2_map = {4: -2, 3: -1, 8: -4, 9: -2}` (default 0) and `dc2 = 0 if M == 9 else 1`.
        *   `rel_c = -3`: If `M == 9`, `(dr, dc) = (-4, 0)`. Otherwise, no shift defined.
    c.  Create a list `mover_targets` to store potential target coordinates `(target_row, target_col, source_rel_col)`.
    d.  For each `(r, c)` in `input_M_coords`, calculate the `rel_c`. If `rel_c` is -1, -2, or (-3 if M=9), calculate the target `(tr, tc)` using the corresponding shift. Add valid `(tr, tc, rel_c)` to `mover_targets`.
    e.  **Mover Placement:** Process `mover_targets`. For each `(tr, tc, src_rel_c)`:
        i.   If the target coordinates `(tr, tc)` are within grid bounds (`0 <= tr < H`, `0 <= tc < W`) **AND** the cell `out[tr, tc]` currently holds the background color `B`:
            *   Set `out[tr, tc] = M`.
            *   If `src_rel_c == -2`, set `flag_minus_2 = true`.
    f.  **Conditional Generation:** If `flag_minus_2` is true:
        *   If `M == 4`: Check target `(tr, tc) = (0, anc_c)`. If valid and `out[tr, tc] == B`, set `out[tr, tc] = 4`.
        *   If `M == 8`: Check target `(tr, tc) = (0, anc_c - 1)`. If valid and `out[tr, tc] == B`, set `out[tr, tc] = 8`.
        *   If `M == 9`:
            *   Check target1 `(tr1, tc1) = (0, anc_c - 1)`. If valid and `out[tr1, tc1] == B`, set `out[tr1, tc1] = 9`.
            *   Check target2 `(tr2, tc2) = (1, anc_c - 1)`. If valid and `out[tr2, tc2] == B`, set `out[tr2, tc2] = 9`.

11. **ELSE IF Mover location is primarily RIGHT (currently only M=7 logic):**
    a.  Initialize `preserved_mover_coord = None`.
    b.  Retrieve Static object (S=9) properties (`static_c`, `min_r_S`, `max_r_S`).
    c.  **Preservation:** Find the first `(r, c)` in `input_M_coords` where `c == anc_c + 1` and `inp[r, anc_c]` is an anchor color. If found and coordinates are valid:
        *   Set `out[r, c] = M` (which is 7). (Overwrites background/static).
        *   Store `preserved_mover_coord = (r, c)`.
    d.  **Shape Generation:** If `preserved_mover_coord` was found and static properties are valid:
        i.   Generate coordinates `shape_coords` for the 'V' shape relative to `preserved_mover_coord` and static properties.
        ii.  For each `(gr, gc)` in `shape_coords`:
            *   If coordinates `(gr, gc)` are valid **AND** `out[gr, gc] == B`: Set `out[gr, gc] = M` (which is 7).

12. **ELSE (Mover pattern unclear / mixed / Anomaly Case like Ex2/Ex4 not fully captured):**
    a.  No further action for Movers. Output contains Background, Static, Anchor placements as determined earlier. (*Note: The current logic will attempt the LEFT mover rules if `avg_col_M < anc_c`, even if it doesn't perfectly match the expected output, as seen in Ex2 and Ex4.*)

13. Return the final `out` grid.
