# Simulating code_execution based on applying NL Program v7 / code_02 logic

# Example 1: M=4, A={2,8}, S=None
#   - Expected Match: True
#   - Analysis: Code correctly applies rel=-1 (0,0) and rel=-2 (-2,+1) shifts, 
#     places on background, and applies conditional generation M=4 -> (0, anc_c).

# Example 2: M=3, S={4}, A={2}
#   - Expected Match: False (Pixels Off: 6)
#   - Analysis: Code identifies roles correctly. Applies left-mover shifts 
#     dr1=-1, dc1=0 and dr2=-1, dc2=1, placing only on background. 
#     Resulting '3' placements are (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). 
#     Expected '3's are at (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6). 
#     Fundamental pattern mismatch. The model does not capture M=3 behavior.

# Example 3: M=7, S={9}, A={2}
#   - Expected Match: True
#   - Analysis: Code correctly identifies roles. Preserves M=7 at (6,7). 
#     Generates 'V' shape relative to preserved point and static S=9 properties. 
#     Places shape points only on background.

# Example 4: M=8, S={3}, A={5}
#   - Expected Match: False (Pixels Off: 4)
#   - Analysis: Code applies shifts dr1=-4, dc1=0 and dr2=-4, dc2=1, placing 
#     only on background. Static '3's are correctly preserved. 
#     Code places 8s at: (0,3) [CondGen], (2,3) [from (6,2) -> rel=-2], (4,3) [from (8,2) -> rel=-2].
#     Expected 8s at: (0,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2), (4,3).
#     Discrepancies: Code places 8 at (2,3) (not expected). Code fails to place 
#     expected 8s at (1,2), (2,1), (3,2). Indicates M=8 shift rules are incorrect.

# Example 5: M=9, S={3}, A={6}
#   - Expected Match: False (Pixels Off: 1 - after dr3 adjustment) 
#   - Analysis: Code applies shifts dr1=0, dc1=0; dr2=-2, dc2=0; dr3=-4, dc3=0.
#     Places on background. Applies conditional generation.
#     Code places 9s at: (0,4)[CondGen], (1,4)[CondGen], (3,2)[from (7,2), rel=-3], (4,3)[from (6,3), rel=-2], (5,4)[from (5,4), rel=-1].
#     Expected 9s at: (0,4), (1,4), (2,2), (3,2), (4,3), (5,4).
#     Discrepancy: Code does not place expected 9 at (2,2). The source/rule for this pixel is unclear.
