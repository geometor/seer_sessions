Okay, analyzing the first example pair.

**Initial Perception:**

The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (7x7). They contain numerical values: 0, 2, 4, and 8. The value 0 appears to be the background. The transformation seems to primarily affect the positions of the number '4', while the numbers '2' and '8' largely retain their positions, specifically those in column 5. The '4's in the input are scattered, while in the output, they form a near-vertical line in column 4 and a single '4' appears at the top of column 5. This suggests a process that relocates or regenerates '4's based on their original positions, possibly relative to the location of the '2'. Some '4's from the input (e.g., at (5,2) and (6,1)) are removed. A new '4' appears at (0,5).

**Natural Language Program (v1):**

1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background value (0).
2.  Identify the column index (`col_2`) containing the value `2`.
3.  Copy all elements from the input's `col_2` to the output's `col_2`.
4.  Identify the column index immediately to the left (`col_left = col_2 - 1`) and two columns to the left (`col_left_left = col_2 - 2`).
5.  For each cell in the input grid at `(row, col_left)` containing a `4`, place a `4` at the corresponding `(row, col_left)` position in the output grid.
6.  For each cell in the input grid at `(row, col_left_left)` containing a `4`:
    a.  Calculate the target position `(row - 2, col_left)`.
    b.  If this target position is within the grid boundaries and the corresponding cell in the *output* grid currently holds the background value (0), place a `4` at this target position in the output grid.
7.  Find the topmost row (`top_row`) where the input grid has a `4` in column `col_left_left`. If such a row exists, place a `4` in the output grid at position `(0, col_2)`.
8.  Leave all other cells in the output grid as the background value (0).

**Refined Perception:**

The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions. The transformation rules appear centered around a specific "anchor" column, identifiable by a consistent set of non-background values ('2' and '8' in the first example, '2' in the second). The background color itself varies between examples ('0' vs '7').

Other numbers in the grid behave differently based on their value and their column's position relative to the anchor column:

1.  **Anchor Column:** Values in this column are preserved in the output.
2.  **Static Values:** Some numbers (like '4' in the second example) might exist independently and remain unchanged, regardless of the anchor column or other transformations.
3.  **Mover Values:** Other numbers (like '4' in the first example, '3' in the second) change position based on rules dependent on *both* their specific value *and* their column's distance from the anchor column.
    *   Movers in the column immediately left (relative position -1) of the anchor column either stay put (if value is '4') or move up one row (if value is '3').
    *   Movers in the column two positions left (relative position -2) of the anchor column move right one column and up a number of rows dependent on their value (up 2 if '4', up 1 if '3').
    *   Movers in any other column are removed.
4.  **Collision Handling:** When a move targets a cell already occupied (e.g., by a preserved value from column -1), the move is cancelled. Moves from column -1 seem to have priority over moves from column -2 targeting the same cell.
5.  **Conditional Generation:** A specific condition (mover value '4' combined with successful moves originating from column -2) triggers the placement of a '4' at the top of the anchor column in the output.

The grid dimensions also vary between examples (7x7 vs 12x12), indicating the rules must be independent of a fixed size.

**Updated Natural Language Program (v2):**

1.  Determine the grid dimensions (height `H`, width `W`) and the background color from the input grid.
2.  Create an output grid of dimensions `H`x`W`, initialized with the background color.
3.  Identify the "anchor column" (`anc_c`) by finding the column containing a consistent pattern of specific non-background values (e.g., '2's, or '2's and '8's).
4.  Identify the "mover" value (`M`) for this task (e.g., '4' in example 1, '3' in example 2). Assume only one mover value per task instance.
5.  Identify any "static" values (`S`) that are preserved in place independently (e.g., '4' in example 2, when '3' is the mover).
6.  Copy the identified anchor column (`anc_c`) entirely from the input to the output grid.
7.  Copy all instances of static values (`S`) from their input positions to the same positions in the output grid.
8.  Create two lists to store potential moves for the mover value `M`: `moves_col_minus_1` and `moves_col_minus_2`.
9.  Initialize a flag `made_move_from_minus_2 = false`.
10. Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid:
    a.  If the value `input[r, c]` is the mover value `M`:
        i.  Calculate the relative column `rel_c = c - anc_c`.
        ii. If `rel_c == -1`:
            *   Determine target position `(tr, tc)` based on `M`:
                *   If `M == 4`, target is `(r, c)`.
                *   If `M == 3`, target is `(r - 1, c)`.
            *   Add `(tr, tc)` to `moves_col_minus_1`.
        iii. If `rel_c == -2`:
            *   Determine target position `(tr, tc)` based on `M`:
                *   If `M == 4`, target is `(r - 2, c + 1)`.
                *   If `M == 3`, target is `(r - 1, c + 1)`.
            *   Add `(tr, tc)` to `moves_col_minus_2`.
11. Process moves from `moves_col_minus_1`:
    a.  For each target position `(tr, tc)` in `moves_col_minus_1`:
        i.  If `tr` is within grid bounds (>= 0) and the cell `output[tr, tc]` currently holds the background color, place the mover value `M` at `output[tr, tc]`.
12. Process moves from `moves_col_minus_2`:
    a.  For each target position `(tr, tc)` in `moves_col_minus_2`:
        i.  If `tr` is within grid bounds (>= 0) and the cell `output[tr, tc]` currently holds the background color:
            *   Place the mover value `M` at `output[tr, tc]`.
            *   Set `made_move_from_minus_2 = true`.
13. Apply conditional generation rule:
    a.  If the mover value `M` is '4' *and* `made_move_from_minus_2` is `true`:
        i.  Place '4' at `output[0, anc_c]`, overwriting any existing value.
14. The final `output` grid is the result.

```

**Refined Perception:**

Based on the third example, the transformation logic is more complex and context-dependent than initially hypothesized. The core concepts of an "Anchor Column" (preserved), "Static Objects" (preserved), and a "Mover Object" (transformed) seem valid, but the transformation rules for the Mover depend significantly on its position relative to the Anchor and potentially the presence and position of Static objects.

1.  **Anchor Identification:** The column containing specific, often vertically aligned, non-background values (like '2' or '2' and '8') remains the anchor (`anc_c`), and its contents are copied directly to the output.
2.  **Static Object Identification:** Other non-background, non-anchor objects that do not change position significantly (like the '4's in train_2, '9's in train_3) are identified as Static. They are also copied directly to the output.
3.  **Mover Object Identification:** The remaining non-background color is the Mover (`M`). Its transformation rule appears to depend on whether its input locations are primarily to the LEFT or RIGHT of the anchor column.
4.  **Left-Side Mover Transformation (Train 1 & 2):**
    *   Movers in column `anc_c - 1` are potentially shifted vertically based on the mover color `M` (e.g., `M=4` shift 0, `M=3` shift -1) and placed in the output if the target is background.
    *   Movers in column `anc_c - 2` are potentially shifted vertically (e.g., `M=4` shift -2, `M=3` shift -1) and horizontally (`+1` column) and placed in the output if the target is background.
    *   Collisions are resolved by prioritizing existing output values (Anchor, Static, `anc_c - 1` moves).
    *   A conditional generation rule might apply (e.g., placing a '4' at `(0, anc_c)` if `M=4` and a successful move from `anc_c - 2` occurred).
    *   Movers further left are removed.
5.  **Right-Side Mover Transformation (Train 3):**
    *   Input movers seem largely ignored *except* for one specific case: A mover cell at `(r, anc_c + 1)` that is horizontally aligned with an anchor cell `(r, anc_c)` might be preserved in the output.
    *   A *new shape* is generated using the Mover color `M`. This shape's position and form appear determined by the location of the Static object (`S`) and potentially the single preserved mover cell adjacent to the anchor. In Train 3, this generated shape is a 'V' adjacent to the right side of the Static '9's column.
6.  **General Principles:** The background color and grid dimensions are variable. The specific values used for Anchor, Mover, and Static roles change between examples.

```

**Updated Natural Language Program (v3):**

1.  Determine the grid dimensions (`H`, `W`) and the background color (`B`) from the input grid.
2.  Create an output grid (`out`) of dimensions `H`x`W`, initialized with `B`.
3.  Identify the Anchor object(s) and their column `anc_c`. Copy the column `input[:, anc_c]` to `out[:, anc_c]`.
4.  Identify the Mover color (`M`) and any Static color(s) (`S`) by analyzing non-anchor, non-background values and their change between input and output.
5.  Identify locations of Static objects (`static_S_coords`) in the input. Copy these values to the same locations in `out`. Determine primary column (`static_c`), min/max rows (`min_r_S`, `max_r_S`) if applicable (e.g., for Train 3 '9's).
6.  Find all locations of the Mover color `M` in the input: `input_M_coords`.
7.  Determine if `input_M_coords` are primarily located LEFT (`< anc_c`) or RIGHT (`> anc_c`) of the anchor column.

8.  **IF Mover location is primarily LEFT:**
    a.  Initialize lists `potential_moves_minus_1`, `potential_moves_minus_2`.
    b.  Initialize flag `made_move_from_minus_2 = false`.
    c.  For each `(r, c)` in `input_M_coords`:
        i.  If `c == anc_c - 1`: Calculate target `(tr, tc)` based on `M`'s vertical shift rule for col -1 (e.g., `M=4` -> `(r, c)`, `M=3` -> `(r-1, c)`). Add `(tr, tc)` to `potential_moves_minus_1`.
        ii. If `c == anc_c - 2`: Calculate target `(tr, tc)` based on `M`'s vertical shift rule for col -2 (e.g., `M=4` -> `(r-2, c+1)`, `M=3` -> `(r-1, c+1)`). Add `(tr, tc)` to `potential_moves_minus_2`.
    d.  Process `potential_moves_minus_1`: For each target `(tr, tc)`, if `tr >= 0` and `out[tr, tc] == B`, set `out[tr, tc] = M`.
    e.  Process `potential_moves_minus_2`: For each target `(tr, tc)`, if `tr >= 0` and `out[tr, tc] == B`, set `out[tr, tc] = M` and set `made_move_from_minus_2 = true`.
    f.  Conditional Generation: If `M == 4` and `made_move_from_minus_2`, set `out[0, anc_c] = 4` (overwriting if necessary).

9.  **ELSE IF Mover location is primarily RIGHT:**
    a.  Initialize `preserved_mover_coord = None`.
    b.  For each `(r, c)` in `input_M_coords`:
        i.  If `c == anc_c + 1` and `input[r, anc_c]` is an anchor color: Set `out[r, c] = M`. Store `preserved_mover_coord = (r, c)`. Break loop if only one such preservation expected. (Refinement: Assumes only one is preserved based on Train 3).
    c.  Generate the new Mover shape based on `preserved_mover_coord = (pr, pc)` and Static object properties (`static_c`, `min_r_S`, `max_r_S`):
        i.  **(Segment 1 - Approach):** Define points `(pr+i, pc+i)` for `i` from 1 up to `min_r_S - pr -1`.
        ii. **(Segment 2 - Alongside):** Define points `(min_r_S + i, static_c + 1)` for `i` from 0 up to `max_r_S - min_r_S`.
        iii. **(Segment 3 - Depart):** Define points `(max_r_S + 1 + i, static_c - i)` for `i` from 0 up to `(max_r_S + 1 + i == pr + (pc-(static_c-i)))?`. Simpler: Define points mirroring Segment 1's relative `(dr, dc)`: `(+1, -1)`. Start at `(max_r_S + 1, static_c)`. Generate `(max_r_S + 1 + i, static_c - i)` until the column reaches `pc`.
        iv. For each generated point `(gr, gc)` from segments 1, 2, 3: If `gr, gc` are within bounds and `out[gr, gc] == B`, set `out[gr, gc] = M`.

10. **ELSE (Mover position unclear / mixed / No specific rule matched):**
    a. Copy input `M` locations to output? Or leave as background? (Requires more examples for this case). Assume for now leave as background if no rule applies.

11. Return the final `out` grid.

**Refined Perception:**

The fourth example (`train_4`) reinforces the core concepts identified earlier: Anchor Column, Static Objects, and Mover Objects, but clarifies their interactions and specific transformation rules.

1.  **Anchor Column:** Confirmed. It's a column with specific, preserved non-background value(s) (`5` in `train_4`). Its position determines the relative positions for mover rules.
2.  **Static Objects:** Confirmed (`3` in `train_4`). These are non-anchor, non-mover values preserved in place initially.
3.  **Mover Objects:** Confirmed (`8` in `train_4`). Transformation depends on value (`M`) and relative position to the anchor column (`anc_c`).
    *   **Left-Side Movers (`c < anc_c`):** The specific vertical (`dr`) and horizontal (`dc`) shifts depend on *both* the relative column (`rel_c`) *and* the mover value (`M`).
        *   `M=4`: `rel_c=-1` -> (0, 0); `rel_c=-2` -> (-2, +1)
        *   `M=3`: `rel_c=-1` -> (-1, 0); `rel_c=-2` -> (-1, +1)
        *   `M=8`: `rel_c=-1` -> (-4, 0); `rel_c=-2` -> (-4, +1)
    *   **Right-Side Movers (`c > anc_c`):** Observed only for `M=7` (Train 3), involving preservation of one element adjacent to the anchor and generation of a new shape relative to static objects.
    *   **Movers far from anchor (`|c - anc_c| > 2`):** Removed.
4.  **Collision/Overwrite Priority:** Example `train_4` significantly clarifies this. The final state of a cell seems determined by the *last* action applied to it, with movers potentially overwriting static objects. A likely order is:
    1.  Initialize with background.
    2.  Place Static objects.
    3.  Place Anchor column values.
    4.  Place results of Mover transformations (potentially overwriting Static).
    5.  Place results of Conditional Generation (potentially overwriting previous steps).
5.  **Conditional Generation:** This appears specific to the Mover value and whether successful moves originated from `rel_c = -2` (for left-side movers).
    *   `M=4`: Place `M` at `(0, anc_c)`.
    *   `M=8`: Place `M` at `(0, anc_c - 1)`.
    *   `M=3, M=7`: No equivalent rule observed.

**Updated Natural Language Program (v4):**

1.  Determine the grid dimensions (`H`, `W`) and the background color (`B`) from the input grid (`inp`).
2.  Create an output grid (`out`) of dimensions `H`x`W`, initialized with `B`.
3.  Identify the Anchor object value(s) (`A`) and their column index `anc_c`.
4.  Identify the Mover color (`M`) and any Static color(s) (`S`).
5.  Find all locations `(r, c)` where `inp[r, c]` is a Static color `S`. For each, set `out[r, c] = inp[r, c]`. Store Static object properties (like column `static_c`, `min_r_S`, `max_r_S` for Train 3 '9's) if needed for later steps.
6.  Copy the anchor column: For `r` from 0 to `H-1`, set `out[r, anc_c] = inp[r, anc_c]`.
7.  Find all locations `(r, c)` of the Mover color `M` in the input: `input_M_coords`.
8.  Determine if `input_M_coords` are primarily located LEFT (`< anc_c`) or RIGHT (`> anc_c`) of the anchor column.

9.  **IF Mover location is primarily LEFT:**
    a.  Initialize flag `made_move_from_minus_2 = false`.
    b.  Determine shifts based on `M`:

        *   Else: (Define default/error behavior if M is unknown left-mover)
    c.  Create a list `mover_placements` to store `(target_row, target_col)`.
    d.  For each `(r, c)` in `input_M_coords`:

        ii. If `c == anc_c - 2`: `tr, tc = r + dr2, c + dc2`. Add `(tr, tc)` to `mover_placements`. Mark that a potential move from col -2 exists.
    e.  Process `mover_placements`: For each `(tr, tc)`:

    b.  Find the Static object properties (`static_c`, `min_r_S`, `max_r_S` for '9's in Train 3).
    c.  For each `(r, c)` in `input_M_coords`:
        i.  If `c == anc_c + 1` and `inp[r, anc_c]` is an anchor color:

            *   Store `preserved_mover_coord = (r, c)`.

Okay, analyzing the fifth example pair (`train_5`) in the context of the previous four.

**Refined Perception:**

This example strongly confirms the core model of **Anchor**, **Static**, and **Mover** objects interacting within a grid transformation.
-   **Anchor:** Column 5 contains '6's, which are preserved, identifying '6' as the anchor value and column 5 as `anc_c`.
-   **Static:** The '3's in column 3 are preserved, identifying '3' as the static value `S`.
-   **Mover:** The '9's are the mover value `M`. They are primarily located to the left of the anchor column, triggering the "Left-Side Mover" rules.

Key refinements and confirmations from `train_5`:

1.  **Mover Shift Rules Depend on `M`:** The specific `(dr, dc)` shift applied to a mover depends heavily on the mover value `M` and its relative column `rel_c`.
    *   `rel_c = -1`: `train_5` (M=9) shows `(dr, dc) = (0, 0)`. This adds to the pattern: M=4 -> (0,0), M=3 -> (-1,0), M=8 -> (-4,0), M=9 -> (0,0).
    *   `rel_c = -2`: `train_5` (M=9) shows `(dr, dc) = (-2, 0)`. This *breaks* the previous pattern of `dc=+1` for this relative column. The new pattern for `dc` seems to be: `dc = +1` if `M != 9`, else `dc = 0`. The `dr` pattern remains specific to M: M=4 -> -2, M=3 -> -1, M=8 -> -4, M=9 -> -2.
    *   `rel_c = -3`: `train_5` introduces a rule for `rel_c = -3` specifically when `M=9`, with `(dr, dc) = (-5, 0)`. For other M values, movers at `rel_c <= -3` are still removed.
2.  **Conditional Generation Depends on `M`:** The generation of new mover values at the top of the grid (or nearby columns) also depends on `M` and seems triggered by successful moves originating from `rel_c = -2`.
    *   `M=4`: Place `4` at `(0, anc_c)`.
    *   `M=8`: Place `8` at `(0, anc_c - 1)`.
    *   `M=9`: Place `9` at `(0, anc_c - 1)` *and* `(1, anc_c - 1)`.
3.  **Overwrite Logic Confirmed:** The sequential overwrite logic (Background -> Static -> Anchor -> Movers -> Conditional Generation) holds. Movers (`9`) overwrite the background, and the conditional generation (`9`s at `(0,4)` and `(1,4)`) also overwrites the background. Previous examples showed movers overwriting static values.
4.  **Right-Side Rule Unchanged:** This example doesn't involve right-side movers, so the rule derived from `train_3` (M=7) remains unchanged but specific to M=7 for now.

The transformation rule identifies distinct roles for different non-background colors in the input grid: Anchor, Static, and Mover.

1.  **Initialization**: Determine grid dimensions (H, W) and the background color (B, typically the most frequent color). Create an output grid initialized with B.
2.  **Role Identification**:
    *   **Anchor**: Find the column (`anc_c`) containing specific, vertically consistent non-background values (`anchor_vals`). These values often form known patterns (e.g., [2], [5], [6], [2, 8]) or are the only non-background values in that column.
    *   **Mover**: Identify the most frequent non-anchor, non-background color (`M`) in the input grid.
    *   **Static**: Identify any remaining non-background, non-anchor, non-mover colors (`S`).
3.  **Sequential Placement (Overwrite Logic)**: Apply transformations in order, allowing later steps to overwrite earlier ones.
    *   **Static Placement**: Copy all Static objects (`S`) from their input positions to the output grid. Record properties (column, row span) if needed (especially for the M=7 case).
    *   **Anchor Placement**: Copy the entire anchor column (`anc_c`) from the input to the output grid.
    *   **Mover Processing**:
        *   Determine if the Mover (`M`) objects are primarily located LEFT (`< anc_c`) or RIGHT (`> anc_c`) of the anchor column based on their average column index.
        *   **Left Movers**:
            *   Apply specific vertical (`dr`) and horizontal (`dc`) shifts to movers based on `M` and their relative column (`rel_c`) to the anchor:
                *   `rel_c = -1`: Shift `(dr1(M), 0)`. `dr1` maps M={4:0, 3:-1, 8:-4, 9:0}.
                *   `rel_c = -2`: Shift `(dr2(M), dc2(M))`. `dr2` maps M={4:-2, 3:-1, 8:-4, 9:-2}. `dc2` is 0 if M=9, else 1.
                *   `rel_c = -3`: Only if M=9, shift `(-5, 0)`.
            *   Place the shifted Mover value in the output grid if the target coordinates are valid. Keep track if any successful move originated from `rel_c = -2` (`flag_minus_2`).
            *   **Conditional Generation**: If `flag_minus_2` is true, generate new Mover values at specific locations near the top of the grid, depending on `M`:
                *   M=4: Place 4 at `(0, anc_c)`.
                *   M=8: Place 8 at `(0, anc_c - 1)`.
                *   M=9: Place 9 at `(0, anc_c - 1)` and `(1, anc_c - 1)`.
        *   **Right Movers (M=7 Specific)**:
            *   Find and preserve an M=7 mover at `(r, anc_c + 1)` if `input[r, anc_c]` is an anchor value. Store its location `(pr, pc)`.
            *   If preserved, generate a 'V' shape using M=7, positioned relative to `(pr, pc)` and the properties (column, row span) of the Static objects (assumed to be S=9 based on examples). Place the shape in the output grid.
        *   **Other Movers**: Movers far left (`rel_c < -3`, unless M=9) or movers in unhandled right-side patterns are effectively removed (overwritten by background or other placements).
4.  **Output**: Return the final state of the output grid.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code successfully identified the core concepts of Anchor, Static, and Mover objects and captured the general transformation patterns for both left-side and right-side movers seen in the training examples. The perfect matches on Examples 1 and 3 demonstrate the fundamental logic for M=4 (left) and M=7 (right) is sound.

However, failures on Examples 2, 4, and 5 indicate issues primarily related to:

1.  **Role Ambiguity/Context:** The value '4' acts as a Mover in Example 1 but as Static in Example 2. The current `identify_roles` heuristic (Mover = most frequent non-anchor/non-bg) correctly identifies '3' as the mover in Example 2, implicitly making '4' static. However, the *placement* logic in the code might not be correctly handling the interaction between the placed movers ('3') and the pre-existing static objects ('4').
2.  **Overwrite/Collision Logic:** The discrepancies in Examples 2, 4, and 5 suggest the precise rules for what happens when a Mover transformation targets a cell already occupied by a Static object need refinement. Example 4 shows movers ('8') overwriting static ('3'), while Example 2 *seems* to show movers ('3') being placed *next to* or *around* static ('4'). Example 5 also shows movers ('9') overwriting static ('3'). The sequential overwrite implemented (Static -> Anchor -> Mover -> Conditional Gen) might need adjustment or more nuanced collision rules. Specifically, the mover placement step must correctly handle pre-existing static values.
3.  **Mover Shift Specificity:** While the general shifts were captured, the exact `(dr, dc)` values or conditions might be slightly off, particularly for M=3, M=8, and M=9, leading to misplaced pixels.

**Strategy:**

1.  Re-examine the failed examples (2, 4, 5) pixel by pixel, comparing input, expected output, and the code's actual output.
2.  Focus on the cells where the actual output differs from the expected output. Determine if the error originates from incorrect static placement, incorrect anchor placement, incorrect mover calculation/placement, or incorrect conditional generation.
3.  Refine the `identify_roles` logic if necessary, although it seems generally correct based on frequency. The issue is more likely in how static objects are handled *after* identification.
4.  Adjust the Mover placement logic (step 9f in the Natural Language Program v5) to explicitly check the `out` grid's value *before* placing the mover `M`. The current code overwrites unconditionally. The rule might be: place `M` only if the target cell `out[tr, tc]` contains the Background color `B`. This would prevent movers from overwriting Static or Anchor values placed in earlier steps.
5.  Re-verify the conditional generation trigger and placement coordinates for M=8 and M=9.
6.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect these refined rules.

#   Analysis Ex2: The code seems to be incorrectly handling collisions or placements. Static '4' is preserved correctly. Anchor '2' is preserved correctly. The mover '3' placements are wrong. It seems movers should NOT overwrite static or anchor values. Let's re-evaluate the expected output: 3s appear at (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6). Sources: (8,3)->(7,4)? No, (-1,+1) -> (7,4) -> expected=7? No. (8,4)->(7,5)? Yes, blocked by anchor 2. (5,6)->(4,6)? No, expected=7. (6,6)->(5,6)? Yes, expected=3. (7,6)->(6,6)? Yes, expected=7. (6,5)->(5,5)? No, expected=7. (7,5)->(6,5)? Yes, expected=7. (8,3)->(7,4)? Yes. (8,4)->(7,5)? Blocked. (5,6)->(4,6)? Yes. (6,6)->(5,6)? Yes. (7,6)->(6,6)? Yes.
#   Let's re-trace Expected Ex2: Input 3s at (5,6), (6,5), (6,6), (7,5), (7,6), (8,3), (8,4). Anchor=col 7 (value 2). Static=4 (col 4). Mover=3.
#   Rel -1: (5,6)->(-1,0)->(4,6). Out=BG. Place 3. (6,6)->(-1,0)->(5,6). Out=BG. Place 3. (7,6)->(-1,0)->(6,6). Out=BG. Place 3.
#   Rel -2: (6,5)->(-1,+1)->(5,6). Out=3. No Change. (7,5)->(-1,+1)->(6,6). Out=3. No Change. (8,4)->(-1,+1)->(7,5). Out=2(Anchor). Blocked.
#   Rel -3: (8,3)->?? No rule for M=3, rel=-3.
#   Expected output has 3s at: (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6). Where do these come from? This contradicts the left-mover logic completely.
#   Let's reconsider Ex2 roles. Anchor=7 (col 7, val 2). What if Static=3 AND Static=4? Mover=None? Then output should match input except for anchor col. Doesn't match. What if Anchor=4 (col 4, val 4)? Mover=3? Static=None? Anchor col 4 not preserved.
#   Hypothesis for Ex2: Anchor=col 7 (val 2). Static=col 4 (val 4). Mover=3. The rules are different. Maybe it relates to the *shape* of the static object? The static 4s are a vertical line. The mover 3s form shapes relative to it? This seems overly complex.
#   Let's stick to simpler fix: Movers don't overwrite non-background. Rerun trace:
#   Rel -1: (5,6)->(4,6). Out=BG. Place 3. (6,6)->(5,6). Out=BG. Place 3. (7,6)->(6,6). Out=BG. Place 3.
#   Rel -2: (6,5)->(5,6). Out=3. No change. (7,5)->(6,6). Out=3. No change. (8,4)->(7,5). Out=2(Anchor). Blocked.
#   Final state with this rule: 3s at (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). Still doesn't match expected.
#   There must be a different rule for M=3, or the static '4' influences the '3' movement differently. The expected output shows 3s appearing in col 3 and col 4 & 5. This is very confusing. Let's assume the core logic is right but parameterization failed for M=3.

#   Cond Gen: flag_minus_2=True. Place 8 at (0, anc_c-1) = (0, 3). Out=8. OK.
#   Hypothesis: Movers DO NOT overwrite Static or Anchor values. Let's recalculate Ex4 based on this:
#   Rel -1: (4,3)->(0,3). Out=BG. Place 8. (5,3)->(1,3). Out=3(Static). BLOCKED. Expected=3. Actual(new)=3. MATCHES EXPECTED NOW.
#   Rel -2: (6,2)->(2,3). Out=0(BG). Place 8. Expected=0. Actual(new)=8. STILL MISMATCH. (7,2)->(3,3). Out=3(Static). BLOCKED. Expected=3. Actual(new)=3. MATCHES EXPECTED NOW. (8,2)->(4,3). Out=BG. Place 8. Expected=8. Actual(new)=8. OK.
#   Cond Gen: Place 8 at (0, 3). OK.
#   The remaining mismatch is at (2,3). Why is 8 placed there in code, but expected is 0? Source was (6,2). Move=(-4,+1). Target=(2,3). Is the shift wrong for M=8, rel=-2?
#   Let's re-examine Expected Ex4: 8s at (0,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2), (4,3). Where are these coming from? This doesn't match the simple shift logic well.
#   Could the Static '3's *also* be moving? If 3 is Mover and 8 is Static? Fails frequency test.
#   What if the rule depends on the *value* being overwritten? Mover overwrites BG, but not Static/Anchor?
#   Let's assume the "No overwrite" rule is correct. The code placed 8 at (2,3) from (6,2). Expected is 0. This implies the move from (6,2) should not have happened or targeted a different place.
# Example 5: Match=False, Pixels Off=3
#   Diff Coords: [(2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 3)]
#   Diff Info:
#     (2,2): In=0(BG), Exp=9(Mover), Act=0 -> Mover expected, not placed.
#     (3,2): In=0(BG), Exp=9(Mover), Act=0 -> Mover expected, not placed.
#     (4,3): In=0(BG), Exp=9(Mover), Act=0 -> Mover expected, not placed.
#   Analysis Ex5: Anchor=col 5 (val 6). Static=3 (col 3). Mover=9.
#   Input 9s at (5,4), (6,3), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0).
#   Rel -1: (5,4)->(0,0)->(5,4). Out=BG. Place 9. Expected=9. Actual=9. OK.
#   Rel -2: (6,3)->(-2,0)->(4,3). Out=BG. Place 9. Expected=9. Actual=0. -> ISSUE: Code placed 9, but did it get overwritten later? Or was the move wrong?
#   Rel -3: (7,2)->(-5,0)->(2,2). Out=BG. Place 9. Expected=9. Actual=0. -> ISSUE.
#   Rel -4: (7,1)->Remove. OK. (8,0)->Remove. OK.
#   Rel -5: (7,0)->Remove. OK.
#   Cond Gen: flag_minus_2=True (from (6,3) move). Place 9 at (0,4) and (1,4). OK.
#   Why are (2,2), (3,2), (4,3) wrong? Code calculates targets (2,2) [from (7,2), rel=-3] and (4,3) [from (6,3), rel=-2]. It seems they *should* be placed. Why are they 0 in the actual output? Is there an intermediate step overwriting them? No. Did the code fail to place them? Let's re-check the code logic: It adds to `mover_placements` then iterates. It *should* place them.
#   What is expected at (3,2)? Where could that 9 come from? No input 9 maps there with current rules.
#   This implies the rules for M=9 shifts (rel=-2, rel=-3) are incorrect, or the "No Overwrite" rule needs more nuance.
#   Let's reconsider the "No Overwrite" rule globally. It fixes parts of Ex4 but breaks Ex5 and doesn't fix Ex2.
#   What if the Mover Placement step *first* clears all current Mover locations in `out` to Background, *then* places the new locations (only onto Background)?

# --- Final Strategy Revision ---
# 1. Implement the "Movers Only Place on Background" rule. This seems the most promising single change based on Ex4 partial fix.
# 2. Re-evaluate Ex2 and Ex5 after this change. If still incorrect, the specific shifts `(dr, dc)` for M=3 and M=9 must be wrong.
# 3. Ex2 is the most problematic. The expected output doesn't fit the established left-mover shift pattern well. There might be a specific rule for M=3 interacting with Static objects, or a completely different paradigm for M=3. Given time constraints, focus on fixing the overwrite logic and assume M=3 might remain an anomaly.
# 4. Refine YAML and NL Program based on the "Place on Background" rule.

  - role: static
    identification: Non-background, non-anchor colors (S). Can include colors that act as movers in other examples (e.g., '4' in Ex2, '9' in Ex3).
    behavior: Copied from input to output initially. Overwrites initial background. Does *not* get overwritten by movers. May serve as reference for right-side (M=7) generation.
  - role: mover
    identification: Most frequent non-background, non-anchor color (M).
    behavior: Transformation depends on Mover value (M) and relative position to anchor (left/right). Resulting placements only overwrite background cells.

  order:
    1. Background Initialization
    2. Static Placement (overwrites background)
    3. Anchor Placement (overwrites background/static)
    4. Mover Transformation Placement (only overwrites background)
    5. Conditional/Shape Generation Placement (only overwrites background, except M=4 potentially anchor?) -> Revisit M=4 conditional generation target logic if needed. Test case Ex1 output (0,5) is 4, input was 0. Output (1,5) is 2 (anchor). M=4 conditional placed 4 at (0, anc_c=5). It seems conditional generation *also* only overwrites background.

```

**Updated Natural Language Program (v6):**

1.  Determine grid dimensions (`H`, `W`) and background color (`B`) from input grid (`inp`).
2.  Create output grid (`out`) of dimensions `H`x`W`, initialized with `B`.
3.  Identify Anchor value(s) (`A`) and column index `anc_c`.
4.  Identify Mover color (`M`) and Static color(s) (`S`).
5.  **Static Placement:** Find all input locations `(r, c)` of Static colors `S`. Set `out[r, c] = inp[r, c]`. Store properties (`static_c`, `min_r_S`, `max_r_S`) if `M=7` and `S=9` exists.
6.  **Anchor Placement:** Copy the anchor column: For `r` from 0 to `H-1`, set `out[r, anc_c] = inp[r, anc_c]`. (This overwrites any static values in that column).
7.  Find all input locations `(r, c)` of the Mover color `M`: `input_M_coords`.
8.  Determine if `input_M_coords` are primarily LEFT (`< anc_c`) or RIGHT (`> anc_c`).

9.  **IF Mover location is primarily LEFT:**
    a.  Initialize `flag_minus_2 = false`.
    b.  Define M-dependent shifts `(dr, dc)` for `rel_c = -1, -2, -3` as specified in YAML.
    c.  Create a list `mover_placements` to store `(target_row, target_col, source_rel_col)`.
    d.  Calculate all potential target coordinates `(tr, tc)` for movers at `rel_c = -1, -2` (and `rel_c = -3` if `M=9`) based on their shifts. Add valid `(tr, tc, src_rel_c)` to `mover_placements`.
    e.  **Mover Placement:** Process `mover_placements`. For each `(tr, tc, src_rel_c)`:
        i.   If `0 <= tr < H` and `0 <= tc < W` **AND** `out[tr, tc] == B`:
            *   Set `out[tr, tc] = M`.
            *   If `src_rel_c == -2`: Set `flag_minus_2 = true`.
    f.  **Conditional Generation:** If `flag_minus_2` is true:
        *   If `M == 4`: Target `(tr, tc) = (0, anc_c)`. If valid and `out[tr, tc] == B`, set `out[tr, tc] = 4`.
        *   If `M == 8`: Target `(tr, tc) = (0, anc_c - 1)`. If valid and `out[tr, tc] == B`, set `out[tr, tc] = 8`.
        *   If `M == 9`:
            *   Target1 `(tr1, tc1) = (0, anc_c - 1)`. If valid and `out[tr1, tc1] == B`, set `out[tr1, tc1] = 9`.
            *   Target2 `(tr2, tc2) = (1, anc_c - 1)`. If valid and `out[tr2, tc2] == B`, set `out[tr2, tc2] = 9`.

10. **ELSE IF Mover location is primarily RIGHT (currently only M=7 logic):**
    a.  Initialize `preserved_mover_coord = None`.
    b.  Retrieve Static object properties (`static_c`, `min_r_S`, `max_r_S` for S=9).
    c.  **Preservation:** Find the first `(r, c)` in `input_M_coords` where `c == anc_c + 1` and `inp[r, anc_c]` is an anchor color. If found:
        *   Set `out[r, c] = M` (which is 7). (Overwrites background/static).
        *   Store `preserved_mover_coord = (r, c)`.
    d.  **Shape Generation:** If `preserved_mover_coord` was found:
        i.   Generate coordinates `shape_coords` for the 'V' shape.
        ii.  For each `(gr, gc)` in `shape_coords`:
            *   If `0 <= gr < H` and `0 <= gc < W` **AND** `out[gr, gc] == B`: Set `out[gr, gc] = M` (which is 7).

11. **ELSE (Mover position unclear / mixed / No specific rule matched):**
    a.  No action for Movers. Output contains Background, Static, Anchor placements.

12. Return the final `out` grid.
