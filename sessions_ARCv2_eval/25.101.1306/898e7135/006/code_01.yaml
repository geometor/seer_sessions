Input_Grid:
  Pixels: Values 0-9 representing colors.
  Background_Pixel_Value: 0
  Base_Content_Colors: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9} # Colors potentially used for background or output objects
  Conditional_Content_Color: 8 # Azure - included only if Orange(7) is present
  Marker_Color_Orange: 7
  Marker_Color_Azure: 8 # Also potentially content

Output_Grid:
  Derivation: Based on background determination and object selection.
  Background_Color: Determined by a rule involving input[0,0] and mode of Base_Content_Colors.
  Content: A subset of input objects.

Derived_Properties:
  Orange_Present: Boolean, true if any pixel in Input_Grid has value 7.
  Actual_Content_Colors: Set of colors, equals Base_Content_Colors + {8} if Orange_Present is true, otherwise equals Base_Content_Colors.

Actions:
  - Determine_Background_Color:
    - Check input[0,0]. If its color `c` is in Base_Content_Colors, use `c`.
    - Else (if input[0,0] is 0, 7, or 8), find the mode (most frequent, lowest value tiebreak) color among all pixels with Base_Content_Colors in the input. Use the mode color.
  - Identify_All_Objects: Find all contiguous objects (colors 1-9) and their pixel coordinates.
  - Identify_Background_Object: Find the specific object instance containing the top-most, left-most pixel matching the determined Background_Color.
  - Determine_Actual_Content_Colors: Check if Orange(7) is present in the input. Define the set of Actual_Content_Colors based on this (include 8 if 7 is present).
  - Select_Content_Objects:
    - Start with the list of all identified objects.
    - Filter this list, keeping only objects that meet BOTH criteria:
      1. The object is NOT the identified Background_Object.
      2. The object's color IS in the determined Actual_Content_Colors set.
  - Calculate_Canvas: Find the minimum bounding box enclosing all pixels of the Select_Content_Objects in their original input coordinates. Handle the case of no selected objects.
  - Create_Output: Make a new grid sized Canvas + (1-pixel padding on all sides), filled with Background_Color.
  - Draw_Content: Copy the exact pixel data of each selected content object from its input location to the corresponding location within the padded canvas on the output grid.
