Input_Grid:
  Contains:
    - Background: White pixels (0).
    - Objects: Contiguous blocks of pixels with colors 1-9.
    - Markers: Orange pixels (7).
Relationships:
  - Orange pixels are often spatially close (adjacent, including diagonals) to other colored Objects.
Output_Grid:
  Derived_From: Input_Grid
  Contains:
    - Background_Color: A single color derived from the input.
    - Selected_Objects: A subset of the Objects from the Input_Grid, possibly modified in shape, placed on the Background_Color.
  Excludes:
    - White pixels (0) from the input.
    - Orange pixels (7) from the input.
Transformations:
  - Selection: Objects are selected based on their adjacency to Orange pixels in the input.
  - Background_Determination: The dominant background/border color of the output grid is determined by the color of the top-leftmost pixel belonging to any selected object in the input grid.
  - Composition: Selected objects (potentially shape-modified) are placed onto the determined background color.
  - Resizing/Cropping: The final output grid dimensions seem determined by the arrangement or bounding box of the selected/modified objects, plus a border, but the exact rule is unclear.
  - Shape_Modification: Some selected objects appear to be replaced by their filled bounding boxes in the output, while others retain their original shapes. The rule for this modification is unclear.
