They seem to serve a special purpose, possibly as markers or selectors.\n*   The output grids are generally smaller or have different aspect ratios than the input grids.\n*   The output grids feature a prominent background/border color, filled with shapes corresponding to *some* of the objects from the input grid.\n*   The white background and the orange pixels from the input are absent in the output.\n*   The relative positions of the objects appearing in the output seem loosely preserved, but the exact shapes might be altered (e.g., some objects appear as filled bounding boxes in the output while others retain their original shape) and the overall arrangement is placed within a new frame/background.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects**: Scan the input grid to find all contiguous blocks of pixels that are not white (0) and not orange (7). These are the initial candidate objects.\n2.  **Select Objects**: Filter the candidate objects. Keep only those objects where at least one pixel of the object is adjacent (including diagonally) to an orange (7) pixel in the input grid. These are the \"selected objects\".\n3.  **Determine Background Color**: Find the pixel among all selected objects that has the minimum row index in the input grid. If there are ties, use the one with the minimum column index among those tied. The color of this pixel becomes the `fill_color` for the output grid's background and border.\n4.  **Determine Output Content Boundaries**: Find the minimal bounding box that encloses *all* selected objects in the input grid. Let the top-left corner be (R_min, C_min) and the dimensions be H x W.\n5.  **Create Output Grid**: Create a new grid. The exact size calculation is complex, but it appears related to the bounding box dimensions (H, W), potentially involving adding a border (e.g., size (H+2) x (W+2), although examples show inconsistencies). Fill this grid entirely with the `fill_color`.\n6.  **Place Objects**: Iterate through the pixels (r, c) within the determined bounding box (from R_min to R_min+H-1, C_min to C_min+W-1) in the input grid.\n7.  If the pixel `input[r, c]` belongs to a *selected* object, copy its color to the output grid at the corresponding relative position, offset by 1 for the border: `output[r - R_min + 1, c - C_min + 1]`. (Note: There might be shape modifications, like using bounding boxes for some objects, but this simple copy is a starting point).\n8.  Return the constructed output grid. *(Self-correction: Step 7 needs refinement based on the observation that shapes sometimes change to filled bounding boxes, and the output size calculation in Step 5 is uncertain)*."
