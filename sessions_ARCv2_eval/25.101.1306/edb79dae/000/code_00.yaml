elements:
  - object: Frame
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - shape: rectangle
      - role: defines the region of interest for the output

  - object: MappingKeyArea
    properties:
      - location: outside the Frame's bounding box
      - contains: MappingPairs and SeparatorPixels

  - object: MappingPair
    properties:
      - structure: two adjacent, distinct colored blocks (often rectangles)
      - role: defines a color transformation rule (color_A -> color_B)
      - location: within MappingKeyArea

  - object: InnerContent
    properties:
      - location: inside the Frame
      - composition: pixels potentially subject to color transformation
      - includes: BackgroundPixels

  - object: SeparatorPixel / BackgroundPixel
    properties:
      - color: varies by task (e.g., azure(8) in train_1, blue(1) in train_2)
      - location: separates MappingPairs in MappingKeyArea, acts as background/separator within InnerContent
      - behavior: remains unchanged during transformation

actions:
  - name: locate_frame
    input: input_grid
    output: bounding_box_of_gray_frame

  - name: extract_mapping_rules
    input: input_grid, frame_bounding_box
    process: scan area outside frame_bounding_box for adjacent color blocks (MappingPairs)
    output: dictionary_of_color_maps {color_A: color_B, ...}

  - name: identify_invariant_background
    input: input_grid, frame_bounding_box
    process: determine the dominant non-mapping color in the MappingKeyArea (outside the frame)
    output: invariant_background_color

  - name: crop_region
    input: input_grid, frame_bounding_box
    output: cropped_subgrid

  - name: apply_transformation
    input: cropped_subgrid, color_maps, invariant_background_color, frame_color (gray 5)
    process: iterate through cropped_subgrid pixels, apply color_maps, keep invariant_background_color and frame_color unchanged
    output: output_grid

relationships:
  - The Frame's bounding box determines the area to be cropped and transformed.
  - The MappingPairs outside the Frame define the color changes applied inside the Frame.
  - The SeparatorPixel color found outside the Frame identifies the color that remains unchanged inside the Frame (along with the Frame color itself).
  - The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the dimensions of the Frame's bounding box in the input.
