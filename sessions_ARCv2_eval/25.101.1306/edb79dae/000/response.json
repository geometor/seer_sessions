            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure**: The input grids contain two main distinct regions:\n    *   An area in the top-left containing small, usually rectangular blocks of color, often arranged in adjacent pairs. These seem to act as a \"key\" or \"legend\".\n    *   A larger rectangular frame made of gray (5) pixels, typically located elsewhere in the grid. This frame encloses various patterns or objects made of different colors.\n    *   There's a background/separator color used both in the \"key\" area and within the gray frame, although this color might differ between the two regions in some cases (need to verify). In `train_1`, azure (8) is prevalent both outside and inside the frame. In `train_2`, blue (1) is prevalent both outside (in the key area) and inside the frame.\n\n2.  **Output Structure**: The output grid is significantly smaller than the input. It appears to directly correspond to the gray frame and its contents from the input. The output retains the gray frame structure. The patterns inside the frame are present but their colors have changed.\n\n3.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves:\n    *   **Identifying the target area**: Locating the gray (5) frame in the input.\n    *   **Cropping**: Extracting the subgrid corresponding to the bounding box of the gray frame. The output dimensions match this cropped area.\n    *   **Identifying color mapping rules**: Analyzing the adjacent color pairs in the \"key\" area (outside the gray frame) to determine how colors should be transformed. Each pair `(Color A, Color B)` implies that pixels of `Color A` inside the frame should become `Color B` in the output.\n    *   **Identifying invariant colors**: The gray (5) frame color remains unchanged. The background/separator color used within the frame (which is usually the same as the separator color in the key area) also remains unchanged.\n    *   **Applying the mapping**: Iterating through the pixels of the cropped (frame) area and applying the derived color mappings, leaving the frame and background colors as they are.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
