Observations:
  - Task Type: Object-based Cropping
  - Background Color: White (0) is the primary background.
  - Input Objects:
      - Composed of contiguous non-white pixels (using 8-way adjacency).
      - Multiple distinct non-white objects are typically present.
      - One object is identifiable as the "main" or "target" object.
  - Selection Criterion: The target object is the one with the largest number of pixels.
  - Transformation Actions:
      - Identification: Locate all distinct non-white objects and their pixel coordinates.
      - Selection: Identify the object with the maximum pixel count.
      - Bounding Box Calculation: Determine the minimal bounding box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col) enclosing the selected object.
      - Cropping: Extract the subgrid from the input defined by the calculated bounding box.
  - Output Grid: The output grid is a direct copy of the portion of the input grid corresponding to the bounding box of the largest object. Pixels inside this bounding box retain their original colors from the input, including background (0).
  - Relationships:
      - The output grid dimensions are determined by the bounding box of the largest (by pixel count) object in the input.
      - The content of the output grid is a direct pixel-for-pixel copy of the input grid within that bounding box area.
