Observations:
  - Task Type: Object-based Cropping
  - Background Color: White (0) is the primary background.
  - Input Content: Contains a background and multiple distinct objects (contiguous non-white pixels using 8-way adjacency).
  - Target Object Selection:
      - Identify all distinct non-white objects.
      - Calculate the number of pixels (size) for each object.
      - Select the object with the largest pixel count as the target object.
      - Tie-breaking (if needed): Prefer object with min top row, then min left column.
  - Bounding Box Definition: The minimal bounding box encompassing all pixels of the selected target object.
  - Transformation Action: Crop the input grid to the exact region defined by the target object's bounding box.
  - Output Content: A direct, pixel-for-pixel copy of the input grid's subgrid within the calculated bounding box. All original pixel values (including background 0s) within the box are preserved.
  - Relationships:
      - Output dimensions are determined solely by the width and height of the target object's bounding box.
      - Output content is determined solely by the input content within that bounding box.
