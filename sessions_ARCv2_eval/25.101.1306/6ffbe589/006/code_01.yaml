Observations:
  - Task Type: Object-based Cropping and Filtering/Cleaning
  - Background Color: White (0) is the primary background.
  - Input Content: Contains a background and multiple distinct objects (contiguous non-white pixels using 8-way adjacency). Often includes small "noise" objects and a larger "main structure" object which might itself consist of different colored parts (e.g., a border and an interior).
  - Target Area Identification:
      - The relevant area for the output is determined by the bounding box of a specific target object in the input.
      - Selection Criterion for Target Object: The object with the largest number of pixels appears to correctly define the output grid dimensions via its bounding box. Tie-breaking uses the minimum top row, then minimum left column of the bounding box.
      - Bounding Box Definition: The minimal rectangle containing all pixels of the selected target object.
  - Transformation Actions:
      - Step 1: Identify all objects, select the largest (by pixel count, with tie-breaking).
      - Step 2: Determine the bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) of this target object.
      - Step 3: Create an initial output grid by copying the content of the input grid within the calculated bounding box.
      - Step 4: Apply a filtering or cleaning process to the initial output grid. This process modifies pixels within the grid based on their color, position, and neighborhood context relative to the structure of the target object (e.g., distinguishing border vs. interior, removing isolated pixels, filling small gaps). The exact rules for this cleaning step are not fully determined but are necessary to match the examples.
  - Output Content: A modified version of the cropped input subgrid, having the same dimensions as the target object's bounding box.
