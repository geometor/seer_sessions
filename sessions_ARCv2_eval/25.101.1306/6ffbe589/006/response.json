            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided validation results consistently show that the implemented transformation logic fails to produce the expected output for all training examples. The core logic tested was:\n1.  Identify all distinct non-background objects using 8-way adjacency.\n2.  Select the object with the largest pixel count (using deterministic tie-breaking).\n3.  Calculate the minimal bounding box for this largest object.\n4.  Crop the input grid to this bounding box.\n\nAnalysis confirmed that this procedure correctly identifies an object whose bounding box *dimensions* match the expected output dimensions in all training cases. However, the *content* obtained by simply cropping the input grid within these coordinates does not match the expected output content. This indicates that the transformation is more complex than a simple crop based on the largest object's bounding box. The discrepancies suggest that pixels *within* the calculated bounding box are being modified or filtered based on some rule, possibly related to noise removal, border simplification, or shape completion relative to the largest object.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe next step is to analyze the *differences* between the simple cropped content and the expected output content. This analysis should focus on identifying patterns in which pixels are changed, added, or removed within the bounding box. Potential rules could involve:\n*   Identifying a \"border\" color vs. \"inner\" colors within the largest object.\n*   Applying rules based on local pixel neighborhoods (e.g., removing border pixels not adjacent to inner pixels, filling background pixels surrounded by border pixels).\n*   Filtering based on object components within the bounding box.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nCode execution was performed to find objects, select the largest one (by pixel count, with tie-breaking: min-row, then min-col), calculate its bounding box, crop the input to that box, and compare it to the expected output.\n\n"

Tie-breaking ensures determinism.\n*   **Bounding Box Coordinates:** The coordinates `(min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c)` are calculated correctly for the selected largest object.\n*   **Output Dimensions:** The dimensions derived from the calculated bounding box (`max_r - min_r + 1`, `max_c - min_c + 1`) *match* the dimensions of the expected output grid in all training examples.\n*   **Content Mismatch:** The grid obtained by directly slicing the input `input_grid[min_r : max_r + 1][min_c : max_c + 1]` does *not* match the `expected_output_grid`.\n*   **Nature of Differences:** Pixels within the bounding box differ. Some non-background pixels from the input slice are background (0) in the expected output, and some background pixels from the input slice are non-background in the expected output. This occurs both for pixels that were part of the largest object and those that were originally background within the bounding box.\n\n**Example Discrepancy (`train_1`, Output Row 0):**\n*   Input Slice Coords: `(0, 6)` to `(0, 18)`\n*   Input Slice Content: `[0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n*   Expected Output Row 0: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]`\n*   Differences highlight modification: Input pixel at (0, 8) is Green(3) but becomes 0 in output; Input pixel at (0, 16) is White(0) but becomes Green(3) in output.\n\n**Conclusion from Metrics:** The transformation involves more than just identifying the largest object and cropping to its bounding box. A secondary step modifies the content *within* that bounding box.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Often includes small \"noise\" objects and a larger \"main structure\" object which might itself consist of different colored parts (e.g., a border and an interior).\n  - Target Area Identification:\n      - The relevant area for the output is determined by the bounding box of a specific target object in the input.\n      - Selection Criterion for Target Object: The object with the largest number of pixels appears to correctly define the output grid dimensions via its bounding box. Tie-breaking uses the minimum top row, then minimum left column of the bounding box.\n      - Bounding Box Definition: The minimal rectangle containing all pixels of the selected target object.\n  - Transformation Actions:\n      - Step 1: Identify all objects, select the largest (by pixel count, with tie-breaking).\n      - Step 2: Determine the bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) of this target object.\n      - Step 3: Create an initial output grid by copying the content of the input grid within the calculated bounding box.\n      - Step 4: Apply a filtering or cleaning process to the initial output grid. This process modifies pixels within the grid based on their color, position, and neighborhood context relative to the structure of the target object (e.g., distinguishing border vs. interior, removing isolated pixels, filling small gaps). The exact rules for this cleaning step are not fully determined but are necessary to match the examples.\n  - Output Content: A modified version of the cropped input subgrid, having the same dimensions as the target object's bounding box.\n```"

For each object, record its pixel coordinates, calculate its size (pixel count), and determine its minimal bounding box (`min_r`, `max_r`, `min_c`, `max_c`).\n2.  **Select Target Object:** Identify the object with the largest pixel count. If multiple objects share the largest size, select the one whose bounding box has the minimum top row index (`min_r`). If a tie still exists, select the one whose bounding box has the minimum left column index (`min_c`).\n3.  **Determine Target Bounding Box:** Retrieve the bounding box coordinates (`min_r`, `max_r`, `min_c`, `max_c`) associated with the selected target object.\n4.  **Crop Initial Grid:** Create an intermediate grid by extracting (cropping) the rectangular region from the input grid defined by rows `min_r` through `max_r` and columns `min_c` through `max_c`.\n5.  **Clean/Filter Cropped Grid:** Apply a transformation process to the intermediate grid to produce the final output grid. This process modifies pixels based on local context:\n    *   It appears to simplify or \"clean up\" the structure derived from the largest object within the bounding box.\n    *   This may involve removing certain pixels (e.g., isolated pixels of a border color, parts of the border not adjacent to the interior) and potentially adding or changing pixels (e.g., filling small background gaps within the border). (The precise algorithm for this cleaning step requires further analysis or hypothesis testing).\n6.  **Return Result:** The cleaned/filtered grid is the final output."
