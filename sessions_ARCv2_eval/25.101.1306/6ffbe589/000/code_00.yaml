Observations:
  - Task Type: Object Isolation and Cropping
  - Background Color: White (0) is the background color in both input and output.
  - Input Objects:
      - Composed of contiguous non-white pixels (using 8-way adjacency).
      - Multiple distinct objects present in input.
      - One object is consistently identifiable as the "largest" or "main" object based on visual size/complexity and pixel count.
      - Other objects are smaller and spatially separated from the largest one ("noise").
  - Output Objects:
      - Contains only one object, corresponding to the largest object from the input.
  - Transformation Actions:
      - Identification: Locate all distinct non-white objects in the input.
      - Selection: Identify the single largest object (based on pixel count).
      - Bounding Box Calculation: Determine the minimal bounding box enclosing the largest object.
      - Cropping: Create an output grid with the dimensions of the calculated bounding box.
      - Filtering/Masking: Populate the output grid by copying only the pixels belonging to the largest object from the input, placed relative to the bounding box origin. All other locations within the output grid (including those corresponding to noise objects or background within the input bounding box) are set to the background color.
  - Relationships:
      - The output grid dimensions are derived from the largest input object's bounding box.
      - The content of the output grid is a filtered subset of the input grid's content within that bounding box, containing only pixels from the largest object.
