There are also smaller, simpler objects scattered elsewhere, appearing as \"noise\".\n3.  **Transformation Goal:** The core task seems to be isolating the single largest object from the input grid.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is always smaller than the input grid and appears to contain only the largest object identified in the input.\n5.  **Cropping:** The output grid's dimensions match the minimal bounding box required to enclose the largest object from the input.\n6.  **Noise Removal:** The smaller \"noise\" objects present in the input are completely absent in the output.\n7.  **Content Preservation:** The pixels belonging to the largest object seem to be preserved in the output grid, maintaining their original colors and relative positions within the object's bounding box. Pixels within the bounding box that were *not* part of the largest object (originally background or part of a different object that happened to overlap the bounding box area) are set to the background color (white) in the output.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"

All other locations within the output grid (including those corresponding to noise objects or background within the input bounding box) are set to the background color.\n  - Relationships:\n      - The output grid dimensions are derived from the largest input object's bounding box.\n      - The content of the output grid is a filtered subset of the input grid's content within that bounding box, containing only pixels from the largest object.\n```"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid to find all distinct contiguous groups of non-white pixels. Use 8-way adjacency (pixels touching horizontally, vertically, or diagonally are part of the same object). Record the coordinates of pixels belonging to each object.\n2.  **Find Largest Object:** Calculate the number of pixels in each identified object. Select the object (L) that has the maximum number of pixels. (Assume ties are resolved consistently, e.g., by picking the one with the top-most, left-most pixel).\n3.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Find the minimum row (`min_r`), maximum row (`max_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), and maximum column (`max_c`) occupied by the pixels of the largest object L.\n4.  **Create Output Grid:** Calculate the height `H = max_r - min_r + 1` and width `W = max_c - min_c + 1`. Create a new grid `O` of size H x W, and initialize all its cells to the background color (white, 0).\n5.  **Populate Output Grid:** Create a set `P_L` containing all (row, column) coordinates belonging to the largest object L. Iterate through each row `r` from `min_r` to `max_r` and each column `c` from `min_c` to `max_c`. If the coordinate `(r, c)` exists in the set `P_L`, copy the color from the input grid `input[r, c]` to the output grid at position `O[r - min_r, c - min_c]`. Otherwise, the output grid cell remains background color 0.\n6.  **Return Result:** The populated grid `O` is the final output."
