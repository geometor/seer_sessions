Observations:
  - Input grids contain multiple rectangular objects separated by a single 'separator' color.
  - Rectangular objects appear primarily in two sizes: 'Frames' (larger, size N x M) and 'Contents' (smaller, size N-2 x M-2).
  - Both Frame and Content blocks in the input may contain internal pixels ('noise') of colors different from their main color. The separator color is frequently used as noise.
  - The output grid arranges the Frame blocks, preserving their relative positions from the input.
  - The output preserves the 1-pixel border of each Frame block, using the Frame block's main color.
  - The interior (core) of each Frame block in the output is filled with a pattern derived from its paired Content block.
  - The core pattern generation involves a color mapping rule applied to the pixels within the Content block's bounding box.
Properties:
  - Separator Color: Color separating the main rectangular objects. Identified by adjacency diversity or frequency.
  - Objects: Rectangular blocks (Frames, Contents).
  - Object Properties: Color (main color), Size (Height, Width), Position (Top-left corner), Type ('frame' or 'content'), Pattern (pixels within bounds).
  - Frame Properties: Size (N x M), Color (Fc), Border (1px thick).
  - Content Properties: Size (N-2 x M-2), Location (Top-left), PatternSource (Pixels within N-2 x M-2 bounding box in input grid), DominantColor (Cc - most frequent non-separator color in PatternSource).
  - Relationships:
      - Frames are paired 1-to-1 with Contents.
      - Pairing mechanism: Simple reading order works for Train 1. Train 2 requires a specific permutation (F1->C1, F2->C4, F3->C3, F4->C2 based on reading order indices). The general rule is unclear.
      - Output layout mirrors the relative spatial arrangement of input Frames.
Transformation Rule (Core Generation):
  - For a given Frame (Color Fc) paired with a Content (PatternSource Cp, DominantColor Cc):
  - Iterate through each pixel `p` at `(i, j)` in the `Cp`:
  - The corresponding output core pixel `Oc[i, j]` is `Fc` if `p` is the `SeparatorColor`.
  - Otherwise, the output core pixel `Oc[i, j]` is `Cc`.
Actions:
  - Identify the Separator Color.
  - Find all non-separator colored rectangular blocks and determine their properties (color, bounds, size).
  - Categorize blocks into Frames (size N x M) and Contents (size N-2 x M-2).
  - Create an ordered list of Frames (sorted by reading order: top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
  - Create an ordered list of Contents (method depends on pairing rule - potentially reading order, potentially requires permutation like in Train 2).
  - Determine the output grid dimensions based on the relative positions and sizes of the Frames.
  - Initialize the output grid.
  - Iterate through the paired Frames (F) and Contents (C):
      - Determine Frame Color (Fc) and Content Dominant Color (Cc).
      - Extract Content Pattern Source (Cp) slice from the input grid based on C's bounds.
      - Calculate the Output Core (Oc) by applying the Transformation Rule (Core Generation) pixel by pixel to Cp.
      - Determine the position for F in the output grid relative to the top-leftmost Frame.
      - Draw the Frame border (Fc) in the output grid at the calculated position.
      - Place the calculated Output Core (Oc) inside the border in the output grid.
  - Return the completed output grid.
