Observations:
  - Input grids contain distinct rectangular objects.
  - A separator color divides these objects (azure=8 in train_1, red=2 in train_2).
  - Rectangles appear in two sizes per input: Larger ('frames') and Smaller ('contents').
  - Frame dimensions are exactly 2 units larger than content dimensions (e.g., 6x6 vs 4x4, 8x8 vs 6x6).
  - Some input rectangles contain internal 'noise' pixels which are ignored.
  - Output grids are composed of modified frame rectangles arranged based on their original relative positions.
  - The separator color and surrounding grid space are discarded.
Properties:
  - Objects: Rectangles.
  - Properties: Color, Size (Height, Width), Position (Top-left corner), Type ('frame' or 'content').
  - Relationships:
      - Frames are larger than contents.
      - A one-to-one mapping exists between frames and contents based on reading order.
      - Output layout preserves the relative spatial arrangement of input frames.
Actions:
  - Identify the separator color.
  - Find all non-separator colored rectangles.
  - Categorize rectangles into 'frame' (larger) and 'content' (smaller) groups.
  - Sort frames by reading order (top-left corner).
  - Sort contents by reading order (top-left corner).
  - Pair frames and contents based on sorted order.
  - For each pair:
      - Extract the 1-pixel border from the frame rectangle.
      - Extract the inner core (removing the 1-pixel border) from the content rectangle.
      - Create a new rectangle using the frame's border and the content's core.
  - Assemble these new rectangles into the output grid, maintaining the relative layout of the original frames.
