**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple distinct, solid-colored rectangular objects separated by a background/separator color. Some rectangles may contain internal "noise" pixels of a different color.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is smaller than the input and is composed of arrangements of rectangles derived from the input.
3.  **Key Objects:** The primary objects are the solid-colored rectangles. They appear in two distinct sizes within each input grid. The larger rectangles act as 'frames' and the smaller ones provide the 'content'.
4.  **Background/Separators:** A specific color acts as a separator between the key rectangular objects (azure=8 in train\_1, red=2 in train\_2). This separator color does not appear in the output.
5.  **Noise:** Some rectangles in the input contain pixels of a different color internally. This internal noise seems irrelevant to the transformation and is discarded or overwritten in the output.
6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves pairing the larger 'frame' rectangles with the smaller 'content' rectangles based on their appearance order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right). The output grid is constructed by taking the border of each frame rectangle and filling its interior with the interior pattern of the corresponding content rectangle. The relative positions of the frame rectangles are preserved in the output grid layout.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Observations:
  - Input grids contain distinct rectangular objects.
  - A separator color divides these objects (azure=8 in train_1, red=2 in train_2).
  - Rectangles appear in two sizes per input: Larger ('frames') and Smaller ('contents').
  - Frame dimensions are exactly 2 units larger than content dimensions (e.g., 6x6 vs 4x4, 8x8 vs 6x6).
  - Some input rectangles contain internal 'noise' pixels which are ignored.
  - Output grids are composed of modified frame rectangles arranged based on their original relative positions.
  - The separator color and surrounding grid space are discarded.
Properties:
  - Objects: Rectangles.
  - Properties: Color, Size (Height, Width), Position (Top-left corner), Type ('frame' or 'content').
  - Relationships:
      - Frames are larger than contents.
      - A one-to-one mapping exists between frames and contents based on reading order.
      - Output layout preserves the relative spatial arrangement of input frames.
Actions:
  - Identify the separator color.
  - Find all non-separator colored rectangles.
  - Categorize rectangles into 'frame' (larger) and 'content' (smaller) groups.
  - Sort frames by reading order (top-left corner).
  - Sort contents by reading order (top-left corner).
  - Pair frames and contents based on sorted order.
  - For each pair:
      - Extract the 1-pixel border from the frame rectangle.
      - Extract the inner core (removing the 1-pixel border) from the content rectangle.
      - Create a new rectangle using the frame's border and the content's core.
  - Assemble these new rectangles into the output grid, maintaining the relative layout of the original frames.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the separator color, which is the color filling the space between the main rectangular objects (e.g., azure in example 1, red in example 2).
2.  Scan the input grid to find all maximal contiguous rectangular blocks of uniform color, excluding the separator color.
3.  Group these rectangles based on their size. Identify two distinct size categories: larger rectangles ('frames') and smaller rectangles ('contents'). The frame rectangles will be exactly 2 pixels taller and 2 pixels wider than the content rectangles.
4.  Create an ordered list of frame rectangles by sorting them based on their top-left corner coordinates (first by row index, then by column index).
5.  Create a similarly ordered list of content rectangles.
6.  Determine the relative spatial arrangement of the frame rectangles (e.g., side-by-side, 2x2 grid). This defines the layout of the output grid.
7.  Initialize an empty output grid sized to fit the arrangement of frame rectangles.
8.  Iterate through the ordered lists, pairing the i-th frame rectangle with the i-th content rectangle.
9.  For each pair:
    a.  Define the area corresponding to the frame rectangle's position within the output grid.
    b.  Copy the 1-pixel thick border pixels from the frame rectangle to the corresponding border positions in the output grid area.
    c.  Extract the inner core of the content rectangle (i.e., the content rectangle excluding its 1-pixel border).
    d.  Copy this inner core pattern into the interior area (inside the border) of the frame's position in the output grid.
10. Return the completed output grid.
