            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 16x16 grid.\n2.  **Background Color:** The predominant background color is orange (7).\n3.  **Foreground Objects:** Various other colors appear as pixels, sometimes forming lines or scattered patterns. These include red (2), maroon (9), blue (1), gray (5), green (3), and azure (8).\n4.  **Transformations:** The core task involves modifying the arrangement or extent of these foreground colored pixels based on their color and initial configuration. The background remains orange unless foreground pixels overwrite it.\n5.  **Rule Variability:** The specific transformation rule appears to change depending on the set of colors present in the input grid. Each example seems to demonstrate a distinct rule:\n    *   Example 1 (Red, Maroon, Blue): Diagonal line extension.\n    *   Example 2 (Gray, Maroon, Green): Horizontal line adjustment (extension/truncation) to a specific column boundary (column 9).\n    *   Example 3 (Azure): Vertical gap filling between pixels of the same color within a column.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the set of unique colors present in the `input` grid, excluding the background color Orange (7). Let this set be `active_colors`.\n3.  **Conditional Rule Application:**\n    a.  **If** `active_colors` consists of Red (2), Maroon (9), and Blue (1):\n        i.  Create a list of potential changes.\n        ii. For every cell `(r, c)` in the `input` grid containing Red (2): Trace diagonally up-left `(r-i, c-i)` for `i = 1, 2, ...`. If the traced cell `(r-i, c-i)` is within grid bounds and contains Orange (7), add `((r-i, c-i), Red)` to the changes list. Stop tracing this path when hitting a grid boundary or a non-Orange cell.\n        iii. For every cell `(r, c)` in the `input` grid containing Maroon (9): Trace diagonally up-right `(r-i, c+i)` for `i = 1, 2, ...`. If the traced cell `(r-i, c+i)` is within grid bounds and contains Orange (7), add `((r-i, c+i), Maroon)` to the changes list. Stop tracing this path when hitting a grid boundary or a non-Orange cell.\n        iv. For every cell `(r, c)` in the `input` grid containing Blue (1): Trace diagonally down-right `(r+i, c+i)` for `i = 1, 2, ...`. If the traced cell `(r+i, c+i)` is within grid bounds and contains Orange (7), add `((r+i, c+i), Blue)` to the changes list. Stop tracing this path when hitting a grid boundary or a non-Orange cell.\n        v.  Apply all unique changes from the list to the `output` grid.\n    b.  **Else If** `active_colors` includes Gray (5), Green (3), or Maroon (9):\n        i.  Iterate through each row `r` from top to bottom.\n        ii. Find all contiguous horizontal segments of Gray, Green, or Maroon pixels in the `input` grid for that row.\n        iii. For each segment found, with color `C` starting at column `c_start` and ending at `c_end`:\n            1.  Extend the segment rightwards to column 9 if it ends before it: For `c` from `c_end + 1` to 9, change `output[r, c]` to `C`.\n            2.  Truncate the segment at column 9 if it extends beyond it: For `c` from 10 to `c_end`, change `output[r, c]` to Orange (7).\n            *(Note: Ensure modifications for one segment don't interfere with processing others in the same row if rules overlap - process based on input state or use a temporary grid/row)*. A safer approach might be to determine the target state for the whole row based on all segments and then apply changes.\n    c.  **Else If** `active_colors` includes Azure (8):\n        i.  Create a list of cells to fill.\n        ii. Iterate through each column `c` from left to right.\n        iii. Find all row indices `r` where `input[r, c]` is Azure (8).\n        iv. If there are two or more Azure pixels in the column:\n            1.  Sort the row indices: `r1, r2, ..., rk`.\n            2.  Iterate through consecutive pairs `(ri, rj)` from the sorted list.\n            3.  Check if all cells `input[r, c]` for `ri < r < rj` are Orange (7).\n            4.  If the gap is filled only with Orange, add all coordinates `(r, c)` where `ri < r < rj` to the fill list.\n        v.  After checking all columns, iterate through the unique coordinates in the fill list and change the corresponding cell in the `output` grid to Azure (8).\n4.  Return the final `output` grid."
