Grid:
  Size: 16x16
  Background: Orange (7)

Objects:
  - Type: Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color: [Red(2), Maroon(9), Blue(1), Gray(5), Green(3), Azure(8), Orange(7)]
      - Position: (row, column)
  - Type: Line/Segment
    Properties:
      - Color: [Red(2), Maroon(9), Blue(1), Gray(5), Green(3), Azure(8)]
      - Orientation: [Diagonal_UpLeft, Diagonal_UpRight, Diagonal_DownRight, Horizontal, Vertical]
      - Endpoints: (start_row, start_col), (end_row, end_col)
  - Type: Vertical Gap
    Properties:
      - Column: column_index
      - Boundaries: Defined by two pixels of the same color (Azure) in the same column.
      - Content: Orange pixels between the boundary pixels.

Relationships:
  - Color_To_Action_Mapping:
      - {Red(2), Maroon(9), Blue(1)} -> Diagonal Extension
      - {Gray(5), Green(3), Maroon(9)} -> Horizontal Adjustment to Column 9
      - {Azure(8)} -> Vertical Gap Filling
  - Adjacency: Pixels can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
  - Betweenness: Orange pixels located vertically between two Azure pixels in the same column.

Actions:
  - Identify unique non-background colors.
  - Select transformation rule based on the identified color set.
  - Trace lines diagonally (up-left, up-right, down-right).
  - Extend lines horizontally.
  - Truncate lines horizontally.
  - Fill vertical gaps between pixels.
  - Change pixel color (Orange to foreground color, or foreground color to Orange).
  - Stop action based on grid boundaries or encountering non-Orange pixels.
