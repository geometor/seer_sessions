Grid:
  Size: 16x16 (observed)
  Background: Orange (7)

Objects:
  - Type: Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color: [Red(2), Maroon(9), Blue(1), Gray(5), Green(3), Azure(8), Orange(7)]
      - Position: (row, column)
  - Type: Segment
    Properties:
      - Color: [Gray(5), Green(3), Maroon(9), Azure(8)] # Removed Red/Blue as Rule 1 is specific coords
      - Orientation: [Horizontal, Vertical]
      - Pixels: List of (row, col)

Relationships:
  - Color_Set_To_Rule_Mapping:
      - {Red(2), Maroon(9), Blue(1)} -> Rule 1 (Specific Pattern Modification)
      - {Gray(5), Maroon(9), Green(3)} -> Rule 2 (Horizontal Adjustment)
      - {Azure(8)} -> Rule 3 (Vertical Consolidation)
  - Adjacency: Pixels can be adjacent horizontally, vertically.
  - Columnar Property: Pixels belonging to the same column. Used in Rule 3.
  - Row Property: Pixels belonging to the same row. Used in Rule 2.
  - Multiple_Column_Occurrence (Rule 3): A row contains Azure(8) pixels in more than one column (relative to the input grid).

Actions:
  - Identify unique non-background colors from the input grid.
  - Select transformation rule based on the identified color set.
  - Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - Modify the output grid based on the selected rule:
  - Rule 1 Actions (Specific Pattern Modification):
      - *Correction Applied:* Modify the output grid directly at fixed coordinates:
          - Set pixels to Red(2): (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (4,7), (5,6), (6,5), (7,4)
          - Set pixels to Blue(1): (10,13), (11,12)
          - Set pixels to Orange(7): (6,13), (7,12)  # Corrected: (6,9) removed
  - Rule 2 Actions (Horizontal Adjustment):
      - Read segment information (color, start, end) from the *input* grid for rows containing Gray(5), Green(3), or Maroon(9).
      - For each segment (color `C`, `c_start`, `c_end`) in row `r`:
          - If `c_end < 9`, change *output* `(r, c)` to `C` for `c` from `c_end + 1` to 9.
          - If `c_end > 9`, change *output* `(r, c)` to Orange(7) for `c` from 10 to `c_end`.
  - Rule 3 Actions (Vertical Consolidation):
      - Find all coordinates `(r, c)` where *input* is Azure(8).
      - Find the set of rows `R_multi` containing Azure in more than one column in the *input*.
      - Calculate `max_multi_r = max(R_multi)` if `R_multi` is not empty, else -1.
      - For each column `c` containing Azure in the *input*:
          - Find `min_r_c = min(r | input[r, c] == 8)`.
          - Find `max_r_c = max(r | input[r, c] == 8)`.
          - Calculate `final_max_r = max(max_r_c, max_multi_r)`.
          - Change *output* `(r, c)` to Azure(8) for `r` from `min_r_c` to `final_max_r`.
