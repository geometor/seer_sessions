Grid:
  Size: 16x16 (observed)
  Background: Orange (7)

Objects:
  - Type: Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color: [Red(2), Maroon(9), Blue(1), Gray(5), Green(3), Azure(8), Orange(7)]
      - Position: (row, column)
  - Type: Segment
    Properties:
      - Color: [Red(2), Maroon(9), Blue(1), Gray(5), Green(3), Azure(8)]
      - Orientation: [Diagonal_UpLeft, Diagonal_UpRight, Diagonal_DownRight, Horizontal, Vertical]
      - Pixels: List of (row, col)

Relationships:
  - Color_Set_To_Rule_Mapping:
      - {Red(2), Maroon(9), Blue(1)} -> Rule 1 (Specific Pattern Modification)
      - {Gray(5), Maroon(9), Green(3)} -> Rule 2 (Horizontal Adjustment)
      - {Azure(8)} -> Rule 3 (Vertical Consolidation)
  - Adjacency: Pixels can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
  - Columnar Property: Pixels belonging to the same column.
  - Row Property: Pixels belonging to the same row.

Actions:
  - Identify unique non-background colors.
  - Select transformation rule based on the identified color set.
  - Modify pixel colors based on the selected rule.
  - Rule 1 Actions (Observed for Example 1):
      - Add Red(2) pixels at specific coordinates: (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (4,7), (5,6), (6,5), (7,4).
      - Add Maroon(9) pixels at specific coordinates: (6,7), (7,7).
      - Add Blue(1) pixels at specific coordinates: (8,15), (9,14), (10,13), (11,12), (10,15), (11,14).
      - *Note: This rule, as observed, seems highly specific to the input pattern.*
  - Rule 2 Actions (Horizontal Adjustment):
      - Identify horizontal segments of Gray(5), Green(3), or Maroon(9).
      - For each segment in row `r` from `c_start` to `c_end`:
          - Change Orange(7) pixels to segment color `C` from `c_end + 1` to column 9 (inclusive).
          - Change segment color `C` pixels to Orange(7) from column 10 to `c_end` (inclusive).
  - Rule 3 Actions (Vertical Consolidation):
      - Find all rows `R_multi` that contain Azure(8) pixels in more than one column. Determine `max_multi_r = max(R_multi)`.
      - For each column `c` containing any Azure(8) pixels:
          - Find `min_r_c` (minimum row of Azure in column `c`).
          - Find `max_r_c` (maximum row of Azure in column `c`).
          - Calculate `final_max_r = max(max_r_c, max_multi_r)`.
          - Change all Orange(7) pixels at `(r, c)` to Azure(8) for `min_r_c <= r <= final_max_r`.
