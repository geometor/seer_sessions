These non-white pixels (\"key pixels\") are always aligned vertically in the same relative column within the white square.\n    *   The output grid's background is always white (0).\n    *   The output grid's height matches the side length (N) of the white key square found in the input.\n    *   The output grid's width seems related to N and the number of pixels generated, usually `max(N, max_col_index + 1)`, but example `train_2` has a larger width (12) than this rule predicts (8).\n    *   The output contains colored pixels corresponding to the key pixels found inside the input's white square.\n    *   For each key pixel of color `C` found at relative row `r` within the input's white square:\n        *   A specific number of pixels (`count`) of color `C` are placed in the output grid at row `r`.\n        *   This `count` depends on both the key pixel's color `C` and the input grid's background color (`BG`).\n        *   The pixels are placed horizontally in the output grid at columns `1, 3, 5, ... , 2*count - 1` (using 1-based indexing).\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "

Scan the input grid to find the largest square region (`key_region`) that meets the following criteria:\n        *   It is composed entirely of white pixels (color 0).\n        *   It may contain one or more single non-white pixels (`key_pixels`).\n        *   All `key_pixels` within this region must be located in the same relative column (e.g., relative column 1) within the square.\n    3.  Record the size `N` (height/width) of the `key_region`.\n    4.  Identify each `key_pixel` within the `key_region`, noting its color `C` and its relative row index `r` (0-based) within the square.\n    5.  For each identified `key_pixel(C, r)`, determine the corresponding output pixel `count` using a predefined mapping based on the key pixel's color `C` and the input background color `BG`:\n        *   If C=1 (blue) and BG=8 (azure), count=2.\n        *   If C=2 (red) and BG=1 (blue), count=2.\n        *   If C=2 (red) and BG=3 (green), count=2.\n        *   If C=3 (green) and BG=1 (blue), count=4.\n        *   If C=4 (yellow) and BG=3 (green), count=1.\n        *   If C=4 (yellow) and BG=8 (azure), count=1.\n        *   If C=8 (azure) and BG=1 (blue), count=2.\n        *   If C=8 (azure) and BG=3 (green), count=3.\n        *   (Assume count is 0 or handle undefined pairs if necessary).\n    6.  Calculate the maximum column index required for any row in the output: `max_col_index = max(2*count - 1)` over all key pixels (using 1-based indexing, so this value is the actual highest column number used). If no key pixels are found, `max_col_index` is effectively -1 or handled as a minimum.\n    7.  Determine the output grid width `W`. Set `W = max(N, max_col_index + 1)`. (Note: This rule might need adjustment based on the behavior observed in train_2 where the output width is 12, exceeding the calculated width of 8).\n    8.  Create the output grid with dimensions `N` rows and `W` columns, initialized with white pixels (color 0).\n    9.  For each identified `key_pixel(C, r)` with its corresponding `count`:\n        *   Place `count` pixels of color `C` in the output grid at row `r`.\n        *   Use the 0-based column indices: `0, 2, 4, ..., 2*count - 2`.\n    10. Return the generated output grid."
