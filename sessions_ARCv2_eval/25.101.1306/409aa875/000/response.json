            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on 16x16 grids where each cell holds a color value (0-9). The background color is consistently orange (7).\n2.  **Objects:** The inputs contain distinct shapes or patterns formed by non-orange pixels (maroon=9 in Ex1, white=0 in Ex2, red=2 in Ex3). These shapes are the primary actors.\n3.  **Transformations:** The core transformation involves identifying these non-orange shapes and then modifying specific pixels in the output grid based on the shape's type, color, and location. The modifications often involve placing new pixels (maroon=9 or blue=1) at locations relative to the identified shapes, sometimes involving vertical projection or filling gaps. Some transformations seem global, triggered by the presence of certain shapes.\n4.  **Color Mapping:** There appears to be a mapping from the input shape's color to the output modification color:\n    *   Maroon (9) shape -> Blue (1) modification (Ex1)\n    *   White (0) shape -> Maroon (9) modification (Ex2)\n    *   Red (2) shape -> Maroon (9) modification (Ex3)\n5.  **Shape-Specific Logic:** Different shapes trigger different rules:\n    *   'V' shapes (3 pixels: top, bottom-left, bottom-right) trigger a vertical projection upwards. The distance of projection depends on the shape's row, and the specific V-shape might matter (e.g., centrality).\n    *   'L' shapes (3 pixels: 2 horizontal, 1 vertical below the left one) trigger gap-filling between adjacent shapes (only for the topmost row of shapes) and a global pattern placement in specific rows/columns.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
