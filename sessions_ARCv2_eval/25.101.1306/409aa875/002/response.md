**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the key shapes (V-shapes, L-shapes) and the general concept of transformations based on these shapes (projection for V, global pattern + local change for L). However, the specific rules derived were not entirely accurate, leading to errors in all three examples.

*   **Example 1 Failure:** The rule for handling maroon V-shapes was incomplete. It correctly identified the central V-shape and the color change to blue, but it failed to handle the non-central maroon V-shapes, which should project upwards using maroon color.
*   **Example 2 Failure:** The rule for calculating the vertical projection offset (`k`) for V-shapes was inaccurate. While the initial `k = 6 if r < 13 else 5` rule worked for many cases, it failed for one V-shape. A refined rule considering the V-shape's distance from the grid's vertical center resolves this discrepancy.
*   **Example 3 Failure:** The rule for the local transformation triggered by red L-shapes was incorrect. The initial hypothesis involved gap-filling between pairs, but the actual rule involves identifying the *single* most central L-shape in the topmost row containing L-shapes and changing its constituent pixels to maroon.

**Strategy:**

1.  Refine the V-shape projection rule: Incorporate the handling of non-central maroon V-shapes and adjust the calculation of the projection distance `k` based on both row index and distance from the vertical center.
2.  Refine the L-shape transformation rule: Replace the pair-based gap-filling logic with the identification and modification of the single most central L-shape in the minimum row.
3.  Update the YAML fact document and natural language program to reflect these refined rules accurately.

**Metrics**

Metrics confirmed via manual inspection during the thought process:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input V-shapes (center, color): (14,1, 9), (14,7, 9), (14,14, 9)
    *   Central V-shape (closest to col 7.5): (14,7)
    *   Expected modifications: (9,1) -> 9, (9,7) -> 1, (9,14) -> 9
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input V-shapes (center, color): (10,1, 0), (11,8, 0), (12,4, 0), (13,11, 0), (14,1, 0), (14,7, 0)
    *   Expected modifications: (5,1) -> 9, (5,8) -> 9, (6,4) -> 9, (8,11) -> 9, (9,1) -> 9, (9,7) -> 9
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input L-shapes (corner): (6,5), (6,8), (6,11), (6,14), (11,13), (14,5), (14,8), (14,11), (14,14)
    *   Minimum row for L-shapes: 6
    *   L-shapes in min row: (6,5), (6,8), (6,11), (6,14)
    *   Central L-shape in min row (closest to col 7.5): (6,8)
    *   Expected modifications (global): (1,0)=9, (1,3)=9, (1,6)=9, (1,9)=9, (9,0)=9, (9,3)=9, (9,6)=9, (9,9)=9
    *   Expected modifications (local): Pixels of L-shape (6,8) i.e., (6,8), (6,9), (7,8) -> 9

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Define constants: `center_col = 7.5`, `k_near = 6`, `k_far = 5`, `row_thresh = 13`, `dist_thresh = 5.0`.
3.  Find all V-shapes `(r, c), (r+1, c-1), (r+1, c+1)` of the same color `C` (not orange). Store their center `(r,c)`, color `C`, and distance `dist = abs(c - center_col)`.
4.  Find all red (2) L-shapes `(r, c), (r, c+1), (r+1, c)`. Store their corner `(r,c)`, constituent pixel coordinates, and distance `dist = abs(c - center_col)`.
5.  **Process V-shapes:**
    *   Identify the minimum distance `min_dist_maroon` among all maroon V-shapes.
    *   For each found V-shape with center `(r, c)`, color `C`, and distance `dist`:
        *   Calculate row-based offset: `k_row = k_near` if `r < row_thresh` else `k_far`.
        *   Calculate final offset: `k = k_far` if `dist > dist_thresh` else `k_row`.
        *   Calculate target coordinates: `target_r = r - k`, `target_c = c`.
        *   Determine output color `C_out`:
            *   If `C` is white (0), `C_out` is maroon (9).
            *   If `C` is maroon (9):
                *   If `dist == min_dist_maroon` (it's a central one), `C_out` is blue (1). (Note: Assumes unique central maroon V-shape or applies blue to all tied for closest).
                *   Else (`dist > min_dist_maroon`), `C_out` is maroon (9).
        *   If `0 <= target_r < grid_height`, change the pixel at `(target_r, target_c)` in the output grid to `C_out`.
6.  **Process Red L-shapes:**
    *   If any red (2) L-shapes were found:
        *   **Global Pattern:** For each `r_glob` in `[1, 9]` and `c_glob` in `[0, 3, 6, 9]`, change the output grid pixel at `(r_glob, c_glob)` to maroon (9).
        *   **Central Modification:**
            *   Find the minimum row `min_r` among all red L-shape corners.
            *   Filter L-shapes to keep only those with corner row equal to `min_r`.
            *   From the filtered L-shapes, find the one (`L_central`) with the minimum distance `dist`. If there's a tie for minimum distance, choose the one with the smallest corner column `c`.
            *   For each pixel coordinate `(pr, pc)` belonging to `L_central`, change the output grid pixel at `(pr, pc)` to maroon (9).
7.  Return the modified output grid.
