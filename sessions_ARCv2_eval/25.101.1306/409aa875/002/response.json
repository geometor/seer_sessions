            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the key shapes (V-shapes, L-shapes) and the general concept of transformations based on these shapes (projection for V, global pattern + local change for L). However, the specific rules derived were not entirely accurate, leading to errors in all three examples.\n\n*   **Example 1 Failure:** The rule for handling maroon V-shapes was incomplete. It correctly identified the central V-shape and the color change to blue, but it failed to handle the non-central maroon V-shapes, which should project upwards using maroon color.\n*   **Example 2 Failure:** The rule for calculating the vertical projection offset (`k`) for V-shapes was inaccurate. While the initial `k = 6 if r < 13 else 5` rule worked for many cases, it failed for one V-shape. A refined rule considering the V-shape's distance from the grid's vertical center resolves this discrepancy.\n*   **Example 3 Failure:** The rule for the local transformation triggered by red L-shapes was incorrect. The initial hypothesis involved gap-filling between pairs, but the actual rule involves identifying the *single* most central L-shape in the topmost row containing L-shapes and changing its constituent pixels to maroon.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Refine the V-shape projection rule: Incorporate the handling of non-central maroon V-shapes and adjust the calculation of the projection distance `k` based on both row index and distance from the vertical center.\n2.  Refine the L-shape transformation rule: Replace the pair-based gap-filling logic with the identification and modification of the single most central L-shape in the minimum row.\n3.  Update the YAML fact document and natural language program to reflect these refined rules accurately.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nMetrics confirmed via manual inspection during the thought process:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input V-shapes (center, color): (14,1, 9), (14,7, 9), (14,14, 9)\n    *   Central V-shape (closest to col 7.5): (14,7)\n    *   Expected modifications: (9,1) -> 9, (9,7) -> 1, (9,14) -> 9\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input V-shapes (center, color): (10,1, 0), (11,8, 0), (12,4, 0), (13,11, 0), (14,1, 0), (14,7, 0)\n    *   Expected modifications: (5,1) -> 9, (5,8) -> 9, (6,4) -> 9, (8,11) -> 9, (9,1) -> 9, (9,7) -> 9\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input L-shapes (corner): (6,5), (6,8), (6,11), (6,14), (11,13), (14,5), (14,8), (14,11), (14,14)\n    *   Minimum row for L-shapes: 6\n    *   L-shapes in min row: (6,5), (6,8), (6,11), (6,14)\n    *   Central L-shape in min row (closest to col 7.5): (6,8)\n    *   Expected modifications (global): (1,0)=9, (1,3)=9, (1,6)=9, (1,9)=9, (9,0)=9, (9,3)=9, (9,6)=9, (9,9)=9\n    *   Expected modifications (local): Pixels of L-shape (6,8) i.e., (6,8), (6,9), (7,8) -> 9\n\n**YAML Fact Document**\n\n"
