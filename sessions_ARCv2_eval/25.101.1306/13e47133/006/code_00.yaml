task_elements:
  - role: grid_property
    type: background_color
    description: The most frequent color in the input grid, excluding the boundary color (red, 2). This color is replaced by seed colors in the output.
    value: [blue (1) in train_1, yellow (4) in train_2]
  - role: grid_element
    type: boundary
    color: red (2)
    description: Pixels forming lines that partition the grid and act as barriers for color filling. These pixels remain unchanged and block fill propagation.
  - role: grid_element
    type: seed
    description: Pixels with colors other than the background or boundary colors. They initiate the color filling process and retain their original color and location. Each seed acts as a source for the fill.
    properties: [location (row, col), color_index]
  - role: process
    type: simultaneous_competitive_flood_fill
    description: Background areas are filled based on a simultaneous expansion from all seed points, respecting boundaries. The fill uses a multi-source Breadth-First Search (BFS).
    parameters:
      - seeds: All identified seed pixels act as sources.
      - background_color: The identified background color is the target for filling.
      - boundaries: Red (2) pixels and grid edges act as barriers.
      - fill_mechanism: Multi-source BFS determines the "closest" seed for each background pixel. Distance is measured in BFS steps (Manhattan distance).
      - tie_breaking_priority: If a background pixel is equidistant from multiple seeds, the seed with the highest priority claims the pixel. Priority is determined by: 1st lowest color index, 2nd lowest row index, 3rd lowest column index.
      - fill_behavior: Fill propagates via 4-way adjacency only into background pixels. Propagation stops at boundaries or already claimed pixels.
  - role: relationship
    type: adjacency_and_distance
    description: Fill propagates based on 4-way adjacency. Closeness (minimum BFS distance) determines which seed's color fills a background pixel.
  - role: constraint
    type: immutability
    description: Boundary pixels (red) and original seed pixels maintain their color and location in the output grid.
  - role: constraint
    type: fill_competition
    description: The first seed (considering distance and tie-breaking priority) to reach a background pixel claims it, preventing other seeds from coloring it.
