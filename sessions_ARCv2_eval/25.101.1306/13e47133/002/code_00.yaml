task_elements:
  - role: grid_property
    type: background_color
    description: The most frequent color in the input grid, excluding the boundary color (red, 2). This color is replaced by seed colors in the output.
    value: [blue (1) in train_1, yellow (4) in train_2]
  - role: grid_element
    type: boundary
    color: red (2)
    description: Pixels forming lines that partition the grid and act as barriers for color filling. These pixels remain unchanged in the output.
  - role: grid_element
    type: seed
    description: Pixels with colors other than the background or boundary colors. They initiate the color filling process and retain their original color and location in the output.
    properties: [location (row, col), color_index]
  - role: process
    type: competitive_flood_fill
    description: Background areas are filled based on flood fills originating from seed points, respecting boundaries.
    parameters:
      - seeds: All identified seed pixels.
      - background_color: The identified background color.
      - boundaries: Red (2) pixels and grid edges act as barriers.
      - priority_rule: Seeds are processed in order of **highest** color index first, then lowest row index, then lowest column index for tie-breaking.
      - fill_behavior: Fill propagates via 4-way adjacency only into background pixels. Fill stops at boundaries or pixels already filled by a higher-priority seed (including original seed locations).
  - role: relationship
    type: containment_and_adjacency
    description: Seed points are contained within regions defined by boundaries. Flood fill propagates based on 4-way adjacency into background pixels.
  - role: constraint
    type: immutability
    description: Boundary pixels (red) and original seed pixels maintain their color and location in the output grid.
  - role: constraint
    type: fill_priority
    description: Fill from higher priority seeds prevents fill from lower priority seeds into the same background pixel.
