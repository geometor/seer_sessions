"""
Transforms the input grid by performing a simultaneous competitive flood fill
originating from 'seed' pixels. Background pixels are claimed by the 'closest'
seed based on Breadth-First Search (BFS) distance. Ties in distance are broken
by seed priority: lowest color index first, then lowest row index, then lowest
column index.

1.  Identify the boundary color (red, 2) and the background color (most frequent color
    excluding boundaries).
2.  Identify all 'seed' pixels (neither background nor boundary).
3.  Initialize data structures:
    - `output_grid`: A copy of the input grid.
    - `distance_grid`: Stores the minimum BFS distance from any seed to each cell
                      (initialized to infinity).
    - `origin_seed_grid`: Stores the tuple `(color, row, col)` of the seed that
                         claimed each cell (initialized to None).
    - `queue`: A queue for the multi-source BFS.
4.  Seed the BFS: For each seed pixel, set its distance to 0 in `distance_grid`,
    record its info in `origin_seed_grid`, and add its location to the `queue`.
5.  Run the multi-source BFS:
    - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a cell `(r, c)`.
    - For each valid neighbor `(nr, nc)`:
        - If the neighbor is a background pixel in the input grid:
            - Calculate the distance from the current cell's originating seed.
            - Compare this new path (distance and seed priority tuple) with any existing
              path recorded for the neighbor. The seed priority tuple `(color, row, col)`
              allows direct comparison for tie-breaking.
            - If the new path is better (shorter distance or wins tie-break):
                - Update the neighbor's distance, originating seed, and color in the
                  output grid.
                - Enqueue the neighbor *only if* the distance was improved (or it's the first time reaching it).
6.  Return the modified `output_grid`.
