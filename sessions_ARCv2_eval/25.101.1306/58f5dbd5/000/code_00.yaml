task_elements:
  - object: Grid
    type: 2D array of integers (colors)
    properties: Height, Width, Pixel values
  - object: Structure
    type: 7x7 block
    properties:
      - border: 1-pixel thick, uniform color (border_color)
      - center: 5x5 area, uniform color (inner_color)
      - constraint: border_color != inner_color
  - object: Pattern
    type: 3x3 grid
    properties:
      - composition: Mix of inner_color and border_color pixels
      - dependency: Determined by the specific combination of inner_color and border_color of the Structure

actions:
  - action: Identify
    target: Structure
    description: Scan the input grid to find all instances of the 7x7 Structure.
  - action: Transform
    target: center (5x5 area of Structure)
    description: >
      Replace the central 3x3 region of the 5x5 area
      with the specific Pattern corresponding to the Structure's
      inner_color and border_color. The 5x5 perimeter retains inner_color.
  - action: Select
    target: Transformed Structure
    description: Select all structures that underwent the Transform action.
  - action: Arrange
    target: Output Grid
    description: >
      Determine the bounding box of the selected Structures in the input grid.
      Create an output grid of the bounding box dimensions.
      Place each transformed Structure into the output grid at its relative position
      derived from the input. Fill interstitial spaces within the bounding box using
      the relevant border_color.
