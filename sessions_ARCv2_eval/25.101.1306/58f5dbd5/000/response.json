            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both inputs and outputs are grids of colored pixels. The output grid is generally smaller than the input grid and seems to be derived by selecting, transforming, and rearranging specific substructures from the input.\n2.  **Key Structures:** The recurring structural element appears to be a 7x7 block. This block consists of a central 5x5 area composed of a single solid color (`inner_color`) surrounded by a 1-pixel wide border of a different, single solid color (`border_color`).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation happens within the 5x5 `inner_color` area of these identified 7x7 structures. The 1-pixel perimeter of the 5x5 area retains the `inner_color`. The central 3x3 area within the 5x5 block is modified by introducing pixels of the `border_color` in a specific pattern. The surrounding 1-pixel `border_color` border of the 7x7 structure remains unchanged.\n4.  **Pattern Dependency:** The specific 3x3 pattern used to modify the center of the 5x5 block depends on *both* the `inner_color` and the `border_color` of the 7x7 structure. Different combinations of inner and border colors result in different patterns.\n5.  **Selection and Arrangement:** The task selects only these specific 7x7 structures (after transformation) from the input. The output grid is constructed to contain exactly these transformed structures, preserving their relative positions from the input. The output grid's dimensions are determined by the bounding box encompassing all selected structures in the input. The space between the structures within this bounding box in the output is filled with the corresponding `border_color`.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

This pattern dictates which pixels in the central 3x3 area will be changed to the `border_color` and which will remain the `inner_color`.\n    *   Construct the transformed 7x7 region:\n        *   Keep the 1-pixel `border_color` frame.\n        *   Keep the 1-pixel `inner_color` perimeter inside the border.\n        *   Apply the determined 3x3 pattern to the central 3x3 area using the `border_color` and `inner_color`.\n    *   Calculate the corresponding top-left coordinates (`r_out`, `c_out`) in the output grid using the bounding box information: `r_out = r_in - min_row`, `c_out = c_in - min_col`.\n    *   **Place** the fully transformed 7x7 region onto the output grid at coordinates (`r_out`, `c_out`), overwriting any initialized values.\n7.  **Return** the completed output grid."
