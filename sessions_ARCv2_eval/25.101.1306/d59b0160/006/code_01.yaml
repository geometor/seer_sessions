task_consistency: low # Rules observed vary significantly between examples.
background_color: 7 # Orange, appears as the most frequent color.
control_column_index: 2 # Column index 2 often influences the transformation.
separator_column_index: 3 # Column index 3 acts as a boundary for the transformation region.
regions:
  - name: control_column
    location: column index 2
  - name: left_region
    location: columns <= 3 (inclusive of separator)
    behavior: Generally preserved from input to output.
  - name: right_region
    location: columns > 3
    behavior: Pixels in this region are conditionally modified based on complex rules.
transformation_hypothesis_1: # Based on initial analysis focusing on Ex2/Ex3
  rule: "Fill right_region with background_color (7) if input[row, control_column_index] is neither background_color (7) nor white (0); otherwise preserve right_region from input."
  validation_result: Fails all examples (84, 35, 58 pixels off respectively).
objects_observed:
  - type: pixel
    properties: [color, row, column]
  - type: grid_region
    properties: [location (left, right, control), transformation_behavior]
  - type: vertical_line (implied)
    location: column index 3
    role: separator
relationships_observed:
  - type: control_influence
    source: pixel at input[row, control_column_index]
    target: pixels at output[row, columns > 3]
    nature: Conditional modification (rule is complex and inconsistent across examples).
uncertainty: The exact transformation rule is unclear due to high variability between examples. Example 1 follows a distinctly different pattern than Examples 2 and 3, and even those two are not fully explained by simple hypotheses tested so far. A more complex analysis involving pattern recognition within the right_region or interactions between rows might be necessary.
