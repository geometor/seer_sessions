The most frequent color, orange (7), acts as a background. The transformation primarily affects the portion of the grid to the right of the green line, selectively changing non-orange pixels to orange. The specific rule for changing pixels seems highly dependent on the color of the pixel in the same row but in the column immediately to the left of the green line (column index 2). Pixels at or to the left of the green line appear unchanged.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

The interaction might involve larger object context or different logic for the two states of the control pixel.*"
