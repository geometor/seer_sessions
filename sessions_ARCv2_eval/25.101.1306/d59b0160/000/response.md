*   **Perception:** The task involves modifying an input grid based on spatial relationships defined by a prominent vertical green line. The most frequent color, orange (7), acts as a background. The transformation primarily affects the portion of the grid to the right of the green line, selectively changing non-orange pixels to orange. The specific rule for changing pixels seems highly dependent on the color of the pixel in the same row but in the column immediately to the left of the green line (column index 2). Pixels at or to the left of the green line appear unchanged.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    background_color: 7 # Orange
    separator:
      type: vertical_line
      color: 3 # Green
      column_index: 3
    regions:
      - name: left_region
        columns: <= 3
      - name: right_region
        columns: > 3
    control_column_index: 2
    transformation:
      scope: right_region # Pixels in the right_region are potentially modified
      action: change_to_background
      condition:
        - type: row_dependent
          based_on: pixel_color_at_control_column
        - details: |
            The exact condition is complex.
            If input[row, 2] is the background color (7), many white pixels (0) in the right_region of that row are changed to the background color.
            If input[row, 2] is NOT the background color (7), the transformation rule for the right_region appears different, often preserving more original colors but sometimes changing non-background colors to background.
            Pixels in the left_region (columns <= 3) seem to remain unchanged from input to output.

    objects:
      - type: pixel
      - type: vertical_line (separator)
      - type: region (left, right)
    properties:
      - color
      - location (row, column)
      - position_relative_to_separator (left, right, on)
    relationships:
      - adjacency (pixels)
      - row_membership
      - column_membership
      - control_influence (pixel at column 2 influences pixels in the same row with columns > 3)
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the background color (orange, 7).
    2.  Identify the vertical green separator line located at column index 3.
    3.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    4.  Iterate through each row `r` of the grid.
    5.  Examine the color of the pixel at `(r, 2)` (the control pixel for the row).
    6.  Iterate through each column `c` starting from column index 4 (to the right of the separator).
    7.  Determine whether to change the pixel `output[r, c]` to the background color based on a rule involving `input[r, 2]` and `input[r, c]`.
        *   *Tentative Rule Observation 1:* If `input[r, 2]` is the background color (orange), change `output[r, c]` to the background color if `input[r, c]` is white (0).
        *   *Tentative Rule Observation 2:* If `input[r, 2]` is *not* the background color, the rule is less clear; potentially preserve `input[r, c]` or apply a different change rule.
        *   *Constraint:* Pixels at `(r, c)` where `c <= 3` retain their original color from the input.
    8.  *(Refinement Needed):* The exact conditions under which pixels in the right region (c > 3) are changed require further clarification, as simple rules based on the control pixel at `(r, 2)` and the pixel's own color (like white) do not perfectly match all examples. The interaction might involve larger object context or different logic for the two states of the control pixel.*
