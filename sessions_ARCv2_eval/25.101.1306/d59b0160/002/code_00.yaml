        IF input[row, 2] IS NOT background_color (7):
          Fill all pixels in output[row, c > 3] with background_color (7).

          Keep output[row, c > 3] the same as input[row, c > 3].
  exceptions_observed:
    - example: train_1
      details: Rule fails significantly. Expected output shows changes even when control pixel is 7, and complex changes when it's not 7.
    - example: train_2
      details: Rule fails when control pixel is 6 or 3 (expected no change, rule predicts fill). Rule fails when control pixel is 0 (expected sometimes change, sometimes no change; rule predicts always fill).
    - example: train_3
      details: Rule fails when control pixel is 0 (expected no change in rows 5, 9, 10; rule predicts fill).
