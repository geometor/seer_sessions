elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - contains_numbers: [0-9] # Primarily 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 observed
      - background_color: 7
      - separator_color: 6
  - object: block
    properties:
      - type: subgrid
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - contains: a shape/pattern defined by numbers other than 6 or 7, padded with 7
  - object: shape
    properties:
      - defined_by: numbers other than 6 or 7 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9)
      - located_within: a block

relationships:
  - separator (6) divides grid into blocks or quadrants
  - blocks contain shapes
  - blocks are rearranged between input and output

actions:
  - identify_structure: determine if input is quadrant-based, vertical stack, or horizontal row based on dimensions and separator locations
  - extract_blocks: isolate the 5x5 blocks from the input grid
  - rearrange_blocks: arrange extracted blocks in the output grid according to specific rules (order, orientation)
  - insert_separators: add rows or columns of 6s between blocks in the output grid

transformation_types:
  - type_1: Quadrant Reordering (11x11 grid -> vertical stack)
    input_condition: 11x11 grid with central cross of 6s at row 5 and column 5
    output_structure: vertical stack (23x5)
    block_order: TL, BR, TR, BL
    separator: row of 6s
  - type_2: Vertical to Horizontal (stack -> row)
    input_condition: (N*5+N-1)x5 grid with rows of 6s as separators
    output_structure: horizontal row (5x(N*5+N-1))
    block_order: reversed
    separator: column of 6s
  - type_3: Horizontal to Vertical (row -> stack)
    input_condition: 5x(N*5+N-1) grid with columns of 6s as separators
    output_structure: vertical stack ((N*5+N-1)x5)
    block_order: preserved
    separator: row of 6s
