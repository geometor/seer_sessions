            "text": "**Perception of the Elements:**\n\nThe task involves rearranging blocks of numbers within a grid. The grids contain numerical values, where '7' appears to be a background or padding color, and '6' acts as a separator. Numbers other than 6 and 7 define distinct shapes or patterns within 5x5 blocks. The transformation depends on the initial arrangement of these blocks and separators in the input grid.\n\nThere are three distinct scenarios observed in the training examples:\n\n1.  **Quadrant Reordering (train_1):** An 11x11 input grid with a central cross formed by a row and a column of '6's. This divides the grid into four 5x5 quadrants. These quadrants are extracted and stacked vertically in the output in a specific order (Top-Left, Bottom-Right, Top-Right, Bottom-Left), separated by single rows of '6's.\n2.  **Vertical Stack to Horizontal Row (train_2):** A tall input grid composed of 5x5 blocks stacked vertically and separated by rows of '6's. These blocks are rearranged into a horizontal row in the output, in reverse order, separated by columns of '6's.\n3.  **Horizontal Row to Vertical Stack (train_3):** A wide input grid composed of 5x5 blocks arranged horizontally and separated by columns of '6's. These blocks are rearranged into a vertical stack in the output, preserving the original order, separated by rows of '6's.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
