Each line is a row, and digits within a line are separated by spaces, representing cells in that row.\n2.  **Output:** The output is a multi-line string where each line contains a single digit. This represents a list or sequence of digits.\n3.  **Core Observation:** The input grid contains a \"background\" color (digit) and several \"foreground\" colors (digits) forming distinct or scattered shapes/pixels. The output list consists of all the foreground digits found in the input grid.\n4.  **Background Identification:** The background color appears to be the most prevalent color, often filling the majority of the grid and specifically the corners/edges. In both examples, the digit at the top-left corner (`grid[0][0]`) corresponds to the background color that is *excluded* from the output.\n5.  **Foreground Extraction:** The digits that are *not* the background color are extracted.\n6.  **Ordering:** The order of the digits in the output list corresponds precisely to the order they are encountered when scanning the input grid row by row (top to bottom), and within each row, column by column (left to right).\n7.  **Transformation:** The transformation rule involves identifying the background color, scanning the grid in a standard top-to-bottom, left-to-right manner, and collecting every non-background digit encountered into a list, preserving the scanning order.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
