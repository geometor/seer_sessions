Task: Extract and order foreground pixels from a grid based on a background color.

Objects:
  - InputGrid:
      Properties:
        - rows: A list of strings or lists representing grid rows.
        - cells: Individual digits within the grid.
        - dimensions: height (number of rows), width (number of columns).
  - Cell:
      Properties:
        - value: The digit (color) of the cell.
        - row_index: The row position (0-based).
        - col_index: The column position (0-based).
  - BackgroundColor:
      Properties:
        - value: The digit identified as the background.
      Identification: Typically the value of the cell at InputGrid[0][0].
  - ForegroundCell:
      Isa: Cell
      Condition: Cell.value != BackgroundColor.value
  - OutputList:
      Properties:
        - elements: A sequence of digits.
      Content: Contains the values of all ForegroundCells from the InputGrid.
      Ordering: Determined by scanning the InputGrid row-by-row, then column-by-column.

Actions:
  - IdentifyBackgroundColor: Determine the BackgroundColor.value from the InputGrid (e.g., using the top-left cell).
  - ScanGrid: Iterate through the InputGrid cells systematically (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
  - CheckCell: For each cell, compare its value to the BackgroundColor.value.
  - CollectForeground: If a cell is a ForegroundCell, append its value to the OutputList.

Relationships:
  - OutputList.elements are derived exclusively from ForegroundCells in the InputGrid.
  - The order of OutputList.elements depends on the row_index and col_index of the corresponding ForegroundCells during the ScanGrid action.
  - BackgroundColor acts as a filter, excluding cells with its value from the OutputList.
