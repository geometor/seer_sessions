This line acts as a barrier.\n    *   To the left of the gray line, there are regions or objects composed of white (0) pixels, set against a background of magenta (6) pixels.\n    *   The transformation involves shifting these white objects horizontally to the right.\n    *   Each distinct contiguous white object calculates its own shift distance. The object shifts rightwards until its rightmost edge is immediately adjacent to the left of the gray line (i.e., in the column `gray_line_column - 1`).\n    *   The original positions of the shifted white pixels are changed to magenta (6).\n    *   If a white object is shifted (i.e., its shift distance is greater than 0), new red (2) pixels appear in the output grid.\n    *   These red pixels form rectangular blocks located immediately to the right of the gray line.\n    *   Red pixels only appear in rows where a shifted white object's rightmost edge ended up adjacent to the gray line after the shift.\n    *   The width of the red rectangular block seems consistent within a single task example but varies between examples (4 in train_1, 4 in train_2, 2 in train_3). The exact determination of this width is not immediately obvious from the provided examples alone but seems related to the rows where shifted objects collide with the barrier. Pixels to the right of the gray line, not replaced by red, retain their original color from the input.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
