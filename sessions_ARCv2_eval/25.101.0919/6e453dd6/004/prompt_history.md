*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are grids of pixels.
    *   The primary colors involved are white (0), magenta (6), gray (5), and red (2).
    *   A prominent feature in the input grid is a single vertical line composed of gray (5) pixels. This line acts as a barrier.
    *   To the left of the gray line, there are regions or objects composed of white (0) pixels, set against a background of magenta (6) pixels.
    *   The transformation involves shifting these white objects horizontally to the right.
    *   Each distinct contiguous white object calculates its own shift distance. The object shifts rightwards until its rightmost edge is immediately adjacent to the left of the gray line (i.e., in the column `gray_line_column - 1`).
    *   The original positions of the shifted white pixels are changed to magenta (6).
    *   If a white object is shifted (i.e., its shift distance is greater than 0), new red (2) pixels appear in the output grid.
    *   These red pixels form rectangular blocks located immediately to the right of the gray line.
    *   Red pixels only appear in rows where a shifted white object's rightmost edge ended up adjacent to the gray line after the shift.
    *   The width of the red rectangular block seems consistent within a single task example but varies between examples (4 in train_1, 4 in train_2, 2 in train_3). The exact determination of this width is not immediately obvious from the provided examples alone but seems related to the rows where shifted objects collide with the barrier. Pixels to the right of the gray line, not replaced by red, retain their original color from the input.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    Grid:
      type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
      colors: [0, 2, 5, 6] # white, red, gray, magenta primarily involved
      size: variable (e.g., 16x16, 16x10, 20x10)

    Objects:
      - type: Gray_Line
        color: 5
        shape: vertical line (1 pixel wide)
        location: specific column index C
        role: barrier
      - type: White_Object
        color: 0
        shape: contiguous region of pixels
        location: left of Gray_Line (column index < C)
        properties:
          - bounding_box
          - rightmost_column_index
      - type: Background
        color: 6 (magenta)
        location: fills space around White_Objects left of Gray_Line
      - type: Red_Region
        color: 2
        shape: rectangle
        location: right of Gray_Line (column index > C)
        status: appears only in output

    Relationships:
      - White_Objects are positioned relative to the Gray_Line.
      - Red_Regions appear adjacent to the Gray_Line in the output.
      - Red_Regions appear only in rows corresponding to White_Objects that shifted and reached the column C-1.

    Actions:
      - Identify the column index 'C' of the Gray_Line.
      - Identify all contiguous White_Objects left of column C.
      - For each White_Object:
          - Find its rightmost column index 'max_c_obj'.
          - Calculate shift distance: 'shift = (C - 1) - max_c_obj'.
      - Create the output grid (initially copy of input, or magenta background).
      - Copy the Gray_Line and everything to its right from input to output.
      - For each White_Object:
          - If shift > 0:
              - For each pixel (r, c) in the object:
                  - Set output[r, c] = 6 (magenta).
              - For each pixel (r, c) in the object:
                  - Set output[r, c + shift] = 0 (white).
              - Identify rows 'R_touch' where shifted pixels land at column C-1.
              - Determine the width 'W_red' for the Red_Region (e.g., 4 for train_1/2, 2 for train_3).
              - For each row 'r' in 'R_touch':
                  - Fill output[r, C+1 : C+1+W_red] = 2 (red).
          - If shift == 0:
              - Copy the White_Object pixels to the output without change.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify the column index `C` of the vertical gray (5) line.
    3.  Find all distinct contiguous objects composed of white (0) pixels located entirely in columns less than `C`.
    4.  For each white object identified:
        a.  Determine the maximum column index `max_c` occupied by any pixel within that object.
        b.  Calculate the shift distance required for this object: `shift = (C - 1) - max_c`.
        c.  If `shift` is greater than 0:
            i.  Keep track of the rows `R_touch` where pixels of this object originally existed at column `max_c`.
            ii. For every pixel `(r, c)` belonging to this object in the input grid, change the corresponding pixel `(r, c)` in the output grid to magenta (6).
            iii.For every pixel `(r, c)` belonging to this object in the input grid, change the pixel `(r, c + shift)` in the output grid to white (0).
            iv. Determine the width `W_red` for the red region associated with this task (this seems to be a fixed value per task, e.g., 4 for the first two examples, 2 for the third).
            v.  For each row `r` in `R_touch`, set the pixels in the output grid from column `C + 1` to `C + W_red` (inclusive) to red (2).
    5.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid (the gray line, pixels to its right not overwritten by red, magenta background pixels not part of an original white object, and unshifted white objects) unchanged from their initial state (copied from the input).
```python
import numpy as np
from collections import deque

"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
1. Identify a vertical gray line (color 5). This acts as a barrier.
2. Find all distinct contiguous white objects (color 0) located entirely to the 
   left of the gray line.
3. For each white object:
   a. Determine its rightmost column index ('max_c').
   b. Calculate the horizontal shift distance required to move the object rightwards 
      so that its rightmost edge ends up in the column immediately to the left 
      of the gray line ('gray_col' - 1). The shift distance is ('gray_col' - 1) - 'max_c'.
   c. If the shift distance is greater than 0:
      i.  Identify the rows where the object's original rightmost pixels were located. 
          These rows will potentially receive red pixels later.
      ii. In the output grid, change the original pixels of the object to magenta (6).
      iii.In the output grid, draw the object's pixels in their new shifted positions 
          using white (0).
      iv. Determine a width 'W_red'. This is calculated based on the *input* grid: 
          count the number of contiguous columns, starting immediately to the right 
          of the gray line, that consist *entirely* of magenta (6) pixels. 
          Cap this count at a maximum of 4. So, W_red = min(4, count).
      v.  For each row identified in step (i), paint a horizontal segment of red (2) 
          pixels in the output grid. This segment starts at the column immediately 
          to the right of the gray line ('gray_col' + 1) and extends for 'W_red' columns.
4. Pixels not involved in the shifting (the gray line itself, pixels to its right 
   not overwritten by red, background magenta pixels, and white objects that did 
   not need to shift) remain unchanged from the input grid unless overwritten by 
   the shifted white objects during step (iii).

"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
1. Identify a vertical gray line (color 5). This acts as a barrier.
2. Find all distinct contiguous white objects (color 0) located entirely to the 
   left of the gray line.
3. For each white object:
   a. Determine its rightmost column index ('max_c').
   b. Calculate the horizontal shift distance required to move the object rightwards 
      so that its rightmost edge ends up in the column immediately to the left 
      of the gray line ('gray_col' - 1). The shift distance is ('gray_col' - 1) - 'max_c'.
   c. If the shift distance is greater than 0:
      i.  Identify the rows where the object's original rightmost pixels were located. 
          These rows will potentially receive red pixels later.
      ii. In the output grid, change the original pixels of the object to magenta (6).
      iii.In the output grid, draw the object's pixels in their new shifted positions 
          using white (0).
      iv. Determine a width 'W_red'. This is calculated based on the *input* grid: 
          count the number of contiguous columns, starting immediately to the right 
          of the gray line, that consist *entirely* of magenta (6) pixels. 
          Cap this count at a maximum of 4. So, W_red = min(4, count).
      v.  For each row identified in step (i), paint a horizontal segment of red (2) 
          pixels in the output grid. This segment starts at the column immediately 
          to the right of the gray line ('gray_col' + 1) and extends for 'W_red' columns.
4. Pixels not involved in the shifting (the gray line itself, pixels to its right 
   not overwritten by red, background magenta pixels, and white objects that did 
   not need to shift) remain unchanged from the input grid unless overwritten by 
   the shifted white objects during step (iii).

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided Python code successfully implements parts of the observed transformation: identifying the gray line barrier, finding white objects to its left, calculating the necessary horizontal shift for each object to reach the column adjacent to the barrier (`gray_col - 1`), erasing the original positions of shifted objects, and drawing them in their new positions. It also correctly identifies the width (`w_red`) of the red region to be painted based on contiguous magenta columns to the right of the gray line in the input.

However, the code fails on all training examples because the logic for determining *which specific rows* should receive the red pixels is incorrect. The code, as described or as executed (based on analysis), generates red rows based on flawed hypotheses (e.g., combining all original rightmost rows of shifted objects, or using all rows touching the boundary in the output). The comparison between generated and expected outputs clearly shows a discrepancy in the set of rows painted red.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Trust Verified Components:** Maintain the working logic for gray line identification, object finding (using the code's BFS approach), shift calculation, object erasing/drawing, and `w_red` calculation.
2.  **Isolate the Failure:** Focus entirely on determining the correct rule for selecting the rows (`R_red`) where red pixels are painted.
3.  **Analyze Boundary Interactions:** Use the detailed metrics gathered via `tool_code` to compare the properties of objects and rows that *do* get red pixels versus those that touch the boundary but *do not*. Key properties to consider for each object touching the boundary are: `shift` value (0 or >0), `original_max_c_rows`, and `final_touch_rows`.
4.  **Formulate New Hypotheses:** Develop and test new hypotheses specifically for the `R_red` selection rule based on the analysis in step 3. The correct rule likely involves a specific condition applied to each object that ends up touching the `gray_col - 1` boundary in the output grid.
5.  **Refine Program:** Update the natural language program and corresponding code implementation once a hypothesis correctly predicts `R_red` for all training examples.

**Metrics and Analysis (from `tool_code` output)**

*   **Grid/Barrier:** Sizes vary, gray line correctly identified.
*   **Red Width (`w_red`):** Correctly calculated as `min(4, contiguous_magenta_cols)` (4, 4, 2 for examples 1, 2, 3).
*   **Objects & Shifts:** Objects left of the barrier correctly identified. Shifts calculated correctly (`max(0, (gray_col - 1) - max_c)`).
*   **Boundary Contact:** The analysis confirms which objects touch the boundary (`gray_col - 1`) in the final configuration and in which rows (`Combined rows touching boundary`).
*   **Red Row Discrepancy:** The `Red Row Comparison` section highlights the failure of the tested hypothesis. The set of rows touching the boundary in the output (`Hypothesis Generated Rows` in the test, representing Hypothesis 7) consistently includes more rows than the `Expected Red Rows`.

**Example 1 Breakdown:**
*   Output Boundary Touches (Col 10): Rows `{3, 4, 5, 6, 7}` (Obj1, shifted) and `{11, 12, 13, 14}` (Obj2, unshifted). Total: `{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14}`.
*   Expected Red Rows: `{4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14}`.
*   Missing Filter: Need a rule that includes rows `{4, 5, 6}` from Obj1 and `{12, 13, 14}` from Obj2, but excludes `{3, 7}` from Obj1 and `{11}` from Obj2.

**Example 2 Breakdown:**
*   Output Boundary Touches (Col 4): Rows `{2, 3, 4}` (Obj1, shifted), `{7, 8, 9, 11}` (Obj2, shifted), `{13, 14, 15}` (Obj3, shifted). Total: `{2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15}`.
*   Expected Red Rows: `{3, 8, 14}`.
*   Missing Filter: Need a rule that includes row `{3}` (from Obj1), `{8}` (from Obj2), `{14}` (from Obj3), but excludes the others.

**Example 3 Breakdown:**
*   Output Boundary Touches (Col 6): Rows `{0, 1, 2}` (Obj1, shifted), `{4, 5, 6, 7}` (Obj2, shifted), `{9, 10}` (Obj3, shifted), `{12, 13, 14}` (Obj4, shifted), `{16, 17, 18}` (Obj5, shifted). Total: `{0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18}`.
*   Expected Red Rows: `{1, 5, 6, 13, 17}`.
*   Missing Filter: Need a rule that includes row `{1}` (from Obj1), `{5, 6}` (from Obj2), `{13}` (from Obj4), `{17}` (from Obj5), but excludes the others.

The filter condition remains elusive based on the tested hypotheses.

**Facts**


```yaml
Grid:
  type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  colors: [0=white, 2=red, 5=gray, 6=magenta]
  size: variable

Objects:
  - type: Gray_Line
    color: 5
    shape: vertical line (usually solid, 1 pixel wide)
    location: specific column index `gray_col`
    role: barrier
  - type: White_Object
    color: 0
    shape: contiguous region of pixels (4-connectivity)
    location: initially left of Gray_Line (column index < `gray_col`)
    properties:
      - pixels: list of (row, col) tuples
      - max_c: maximum column index of any pixel in the object
      - shift: calculated horizontal shift distance `max(0, (gray_col - 1) - max_c)`
      - final_touch_rows: set of rows `r` where a pixel exists at `(r, gray_col - 1)` in the output grid belonging to this object.
  - type: Background
    color: 6 (magenta)
  - type: Red_Region
    color: 2
    shape: horizontal rectangle segment(s)
    location: right of Gray_Line (columns >= `gray_col + 1`)
    status: appears only in output
    properties:
      - width: `w_red = min(4, count of contiguous all-magenta columns in input starting at gray_col + 1)`
      - rows: A specific subset `R_red` of all `final_touch_rows` from all objects touching the boundary. The exact selection rule for `R_red` is the primary unsolved part of the transformation. Documented target sets for `R_red`:
          - Ex1: {4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14}
          - Ex2: {3, 8, 14}
          - Ex3: {1, 5, 6, 13, 17}

Actions:
  - Find `gray_col`.
  - Calculate `w_red` based on magenta columns right of `gray_col` in the input.
  - Find all `White_Objects` left of `gray_col`.
  - Create `output_grid` (copy of input).
  - Create list `objects_touching_boundary` containing tuples `(object_id, final_touch_rows_for_object)`.
  - For each `White_Object`:
    - Calculate its `shift`.
    - Collect original coordinates `(r, c)` for erasure if `shift > 0`.
    - Collect target coordinates `(r, c + shift)` for drawing.
    - Determine `final_touch_rows_for_object`. If not empty, add `(object_id, final_touch_rows_for_object)` to `objects_touching_boundary`.
  - Perform modifications:
    - Erase original positions for shifted objects (set to magenta).
    - Draw objects at target positions (set to white).
  - Determine the final set of rows `R_red` based on a **currently unknown filtering rule** applied to the data in `objects_touching_boundary`.
  - If `w_red > 0`:
    - For each row `r` in `R_red`:
        - Paint red segment: Set `output_grid[r, gray_col + 1 : gray_col + 1 + w_red] = RED`.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Identify the column index `gray_col` of the vertical gray (5) line barrier.
3.  Calculate the red region width `w_red`: Find the number of consecutive columns starting at `gray_col + 1` in the `input_grid` that contain only magenta (6) pixels. Set `w_red` to this count, but no more than 4.
4.  Find all distinct contiguous white (0) objects located entirely to the left of `gray_col` in the `input_grid`.
5.  Prepare lists for modifications: `coords_to_erase` and `coords_to_draw`. Also prepare a list `boundary_touchers` to store information about objects that will touch the boundary.
6.  For each white object found:
    a.  Determine its rightmost column index `max_c`.
    b.  Calculate the horizontal shift: `shift = max(0, (gray_col - 1) - max_c)`.
    c.  If `shift > 0`, add all original `(r, c)` coordinates of this object to `coords_to_erase`.
    d.  Collect all target coordinates `(r, c_new)` where `c_new = c + shift` and `c_new < gray_col`. Add these to `coords_to_draw`.
    e.  Identify the set of rows `final_touch_rows` for this object where `c_new == gray_col - 1`. If this set is not empty, store this object's identifier and its `final_touch_rows` together in the `boundary_touchers` list.
7.  Apply the main object movement modifications to the `output_grid`:
    a.  For each `(r, c)` in `coords_to_erase`, set `output_grid[r, c] = 6` (magenta).
    b.  For each `(r, c_new)` in `coords_to_draw`, set `output_grid[r, c_new] = 0` (white).
8.  Determine the final set of rows `R_red` that will receive red pixels:
    a.  Initialize `R_red` as an empty set.
    b.  Iterate through the `boundary_touchers` list. For each entry `(object_id, final_touch_rows_for_object)`:
        i.  Apply a **specific, currently unknown filtering rule** to `final_touch_rows_for_object` based potentially on the properties of the object (`object_id`) or the relationship between its original and final state.
        ii. Add the rows selected by the filter to the `R_red` set.
9.  If `w_red > 0`, paint the red regions: For each row `r` in the final `R_red` set, change the pixels in the `output_grid` from column `gray_col + 1` up to (but not including) column `gray_col + 1 + w_red` to red (2). Ensure painting does not go beyond the grid's right boundary.
```python
import numpy as np
from collections import deque

"""
Transforms the input grid based on object movement and boundary interaction rules:
1.  Identify a vertical gray line (color 5) acting as a barrier.
2.  Calculate the width for potential red regions (`w_red`) based on the number 
    of contiguous all-magenta (color 6) columns immediately to the right of the 
    gray line in the input grid, capped at a maximum width of 4.
3.  Find all distinct contiguous white objects (color 0) located entirely to the 
    left of the gray line.
4.  For each white object:
    a.  Determine its rightmost column (`max_c`).
    b.  Calculate the necessary horizontal shift (`shift`) to move its rightmost 
        edge to the column immediately left of the gray line (`gray_col - 1`).
    c.  If the shift is greater than 0, mark the object's original pixels for 
        erasure (change to magenta).
    d.  Mark the object's pixels for drawing at their new, shifted positions.
    e.  Determine the rows where the object's pixels land in the column 
        `gray_col - 1` after shifting (or originally, if shift is 0).
5.  Apply the erasures and drawings to create an intermediate grid state.
6.  Determine the final set of rows (`R_red`) that should receive red pixels. 
    This step involves a filtering rule applied to the rows identified in step 4e, 
    specifically for objects that required a shift > 0. The exact filtering rule 
    is currently uncertain but is hypothesized to be based on the interaction 
    at the boundary. **(Current implementation uses a placeholder/incorrect rule: 
    includes all rows touched by *shifted* objects at the boundary).**
7.  If `w_red` is greater than 0, paint horizontal red segments (color 2) of 
    width `w_red` starting at column `gray_col + 1` for each row in the 
    final `R_red` set.
