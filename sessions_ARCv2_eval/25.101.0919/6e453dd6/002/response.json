            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided Python code successfully implements parts of the observed transformation: identifying the gray line barrier, finding white objects to its left, calculating the necessary horizontal shift for each object to reach the column adjacent to the barrier (`gray_col - 1`), erasing the original positions of shifted objects, and drawing them in their new positions. It also correctly identifies the width (`w_red`) of the red region to be painted based on contiguous magenta columns to the right of the gray line in the input.\n\nHowever, the code fails on all training examples because the logic for determining *which specific rows* should receive the red pixels is incorrect. The code, as described or as executed (based on analysis), generates red rows based on flawed hypotheses (e.g., combining all original rightmost rows of shifted objects, or using all rows touching the boundary in the output). The comparison between generated and expected outputs clearly shows a discrepancy in the set of rows painted red.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Trust Verified Components:** Maintain the working logic for gray line identification, object finding (using the code's BFS approach), shift calculation, object erasing/drawing, and `w_red` calculation.\n2.  **Isolate the Failure:** Focus entirely on determining the correct rule for selecting the rows (`R_red`) where red pixels are painted.\n3.  **Analyze Boundary Interactions:** Use the detailed metrics gathered via `tool_code` to compare the properties of objects and rows that *do* get red pixels versus those that touch the boundary but *do not*. Key properties to consider for each object touching the boundary are: `shift` value (0 or >0), `original_max_c_rows`, and `final_touch_rows`.\n4.  **Formulate New Hypotheses:** Develop and test new hypotheses specifically for the `R_red` selection rule based on the analysis in step 3. The correct rule likely involves a specific condition applied to each object that ends up touching the `gray_col - 1` boundary in the output grid.\n5.  **Refine Program:** Update the natural language program and corresponding code implementation once a hypothesis correctly predicts `R_red` for all training examples.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis (from `tool_code` output)**\n\n*   **Grid/Barrier:** Sizes vary, gray line correctly identified.\n*   **Red Width (`w_red`):** Correctly calculated as `min(4, contiguous_magenta_cols)` (4, 4, 2 for examples 1, 2, 3).\n*   **Objects & Shifts:** Objects left of the barrier correctly identified. Shifts calculated correctly (`max(0, (gray_col - 1) - max_c)`).\n*   **Boundary Contact:** The analysis confirms which objects touch the boundary (`gray_col - 1`) in the final configuration and in which rows (`Combined rows touching boundary`).\n*   **Red Row Discrepancy:** The `Red Row Comparison` section highlights the failure of the tested hypothesis. The set of rows touching the boundary in the output (`Hypothesis Generated Rows` in the test, representing Hypothesis 7) consistently includes more rows than the `Expected Red Rows`.\n\n**Example 1 Breakdown:**\n*   Output Boundary Touches (Col 10): Rows `{3, 4, 5, 6, 7}` (Obj1, shifted) and `{11, 12, 13, 14}` (Obj2, unshifted). Total: `{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14}`.\n*   Expected Red Rows: `{4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14}`.\n*   Missing Filter: Need a rule that includes rows `{4, 5, 6}` from Obj1 and `{12, 13, 14}` from Obj2, but excludes `{3, 7}` from Obj1 and `{11}` from Obj2.\n\n**Example 2 Breakdown:**\n*   Output Boundary Touches (Col 4): Rows `{2, 3, 4}` (Obj1, shifted), `{7, 8, 9, 11}` (Obj2, shifted), `{13, 14, 15}` (Obj3, shifted). Total: `{2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15}`.\n*   Expected Red Rows: `{3, 8, 14}`.\n*   Missing Filter: Need a rule that includes row `{3}` (from Obj1), `{8}` (from Obj2), `{14}` (from Obj3), but excludes the others.\n\n**Example 3 Breakdown:**\n*   Output Boundary Touches (Col 6): Rows `{0, 1, 2}` (Obj1, shifted), `{4, 5, 6, 7}` (Obj2, shifted), `{9, 10}` (Obj3, shifted), `{12, 13, 14}` (Obj4, shifted), `{16, 17, 18}` (Obj5, shifted). Total: `{0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18}`.\n*   Expected Red Rows: `{1, 5, 6, 13, 17}`.\n*   Missing Filter: Need a rule that includes row `{1}` (from Obj1), `{5, 6}` (from Obj2), `{13}` (from Obj4), `{17}` (from Obj5), but excludes the others.\n\nThe filter condition remains elusive based on the tested hypotheses.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify the column index `gray_col` of the vertical gray (5) line barrier.\n3.  Calculate the red region width `w_red`: Find the number of consecutive columns starting at `gray_col + 1` in the `input_grid` that contain only magenta (6) pixels. Set `w_red` to this count, but no more than 4.\n4.  Find all distinct contiguous white (0) objects located entirely to the left of `gray_col` in the `input_grid`.\n5.  Prepare lists for modifications: `coords_to_erase` and `coords_to_draw`. Also prepare a list `boundary_touchers` to store information about objects that will touch the boundary.\n6.  For each white object found:\n    a.  Determine its rightmost column index `max_c`.\n    b.  Calculate the horizontal shift: `shift = max(0, (gray_col - 1) - max_c)`.\n    c.  If `shift > 0`, add all original `(r, c)` coordinates of this object to `coords_to_erase`.\n    d.  Collect all target coordinates `(r, c_new)` where `c_new = c + shift` and `c_new < gray_col`. Add these to `coords_to_draw`.\n    e.  Identify the set of rows `final_touch_rows` for this object where `c_new == gray_col - 1`. If this set is not empty, store this object's identifier and its `final_touch_rows` together in the `boundary_touchers` list.\n7.  Apply the main object movement modifications to the `output_grid`:\n    a.  For each `(r, c)` in `coords_to_erase`, set `output_grid[r, c] = 6` (magenta).\n    b.  For each `(r, c_new)` in `coords_to_draw`, set `output_grid[r, c_new] = 0` (white).\n8.  Determine the final set of rows `R_red` that will receive red pixels:\n    a.  Initialize `R_red` as an empty set.\n    b.  Iterate through the `boundary_touchers` list. For each entry `(object_id, final_touch_rows_for_object)`:\n        i.  Apply a **specific, currently unknown filtering rule** to `final_touch_rows_for_object` based potentially on the properties of the object (`object_id`) or the relationship between its original and final state.\n        ii. Add the rows selected by the filter to the `R_red` set.\n9.  If `w_red > 0`, paint the red regions: For each row `r` in the final `R_red` set, change the pixels in the `output_grid` from column `gray_col + 1` up to (but not including) column `gray_col + 1 + w_red` to red (2). Ensure painting does not go beyond the grid's right boundary."
