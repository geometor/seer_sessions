elements:
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: red (2), green (3), gray (5), blue (1), yellow (4), magenta (6)
      - size: 1x1
  - object: square_2x2
    properties:
      - color: magenta (6)
      - fill: solid
      - size: 2x2
  - object: L_shape
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - size: variable (e.g., 4x4 with corner missing in train_2)
      - fill: solid
  - object: hollow_square_4x4
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4) # Found in input train_3
      - fill: hollow
      - size: 4x4

actions:
  - action: transform_to_hollow_square
    description: Replaces specific input objects with a 4x4 hollow square anchored at the input object's top-left corner.
    applies_to:
      - object: pixel
        color: red (2)
        output_color: yellow (4)
      - object: pixel
        color: green (3)
        output_color: blue (1)
        exceptions: # These specific pixels are deleted instead
          - train_1, location: (16, 2)
          - train_2, location: (9, 9)
      - object: pixel
        color: gray (5)
        output_color: gray (5)
        exceptions: # This specific pixel is deleted instead
          - train_1, location: (5, 5)
      - object: square_2x2
        color: magenta (6)
        output_color: magenta (6)
    output_object:
      - object: hollow_square_4x4
        size: 4x4
        anchor: top-left corner of input object
        color: determined by input color mapping

  - action: copy
    description: Copies the object directly to the output grid.
    applies_to:
      - object: L_shape
        color: blue (1) # As seen in train_2
    result: Identical object shape and color in the output at the same coordinates.

  - action: delete
    description: Removes the object from the grid (effectively replacing it with the background color).
    applies_to:
      - object: hollow_square_4x4
        color: yellow (4) # As seen in input train_3
      - object: pixel # Specific exceptions noted in transform_to_hollow_square
        color: green (3), gray (5)
        condition: Matches specific locations identified in training examples.
    result: Object pixels are replaced by background color (white, 0).

relationships:
  - relationship: position_mapping
    description: The top-left coordinate of an input object serves as the anchor point (top-left coordinate) for the corresponding output 4x4 hollow square.
  - relationship: overlap_resolution
    description: When multiple output shapes (squares or copied objects) occupy the same pixel, the one processed/drawn later takes precedence, overwriting the previous pixel value.
