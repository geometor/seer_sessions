elements:
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: red (2), green (3), gray (5)
      - size: 1x1
      - role: Potential trigger for transformation, unless part of a larger shape or specifically ignored.

    properties:
      - color: magenta (6)
      - fill: solid

  - object: L_shape_blue
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - structure: Specific 8-pixel shape relative to anchor (e.g., rel coords {(0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,3), (2,0), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2)})
      - role: Identified first. Copied directly to output. Constituent pixels marked as used.
  - object: hollow_square_4x4_yellow
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - fill: hollow
      - size: 4x4
      - role: Identified first. Deleted (ignored during output generation). Constituent pixels marked as used.

ignored_locations: # Specific input pixel locations (row, col, color) that are NOT transformed
  - (5, 5, 5)   # Train 1, Gray
  - (16, 2, 3)  # Train 1, Green
  - (5, 5, 3)   # Train 2, Green
  - (9, 9, 3)   # Train 2, Green
  - (4, 4, 2)   # Train 3, Red

output_object: # The standard shape generated by transformations
  - object: hollow_square_4x4_standard
    properties:
      - size: 4x4
      - fill: hollow (perimeter only, including corners)
      - color: yellow(4), blue(1), gray(5), or magenta(6) depending on trigger

actions:
  - action: transform_to_standard_hollow_square_4x4
    description: Replaces specific input objects/pixels with a standard 4x4 hollow square anchored at the input's top-left corner.
    applies_to:
      - object: pixel
        color: red (2)
        output_color: yellow (4)
        condition: NOT part of a larger shape AND location/color NOT in `ignored_locations`.
      - object: pixel
        color: green (3)
        output_color: blue (1)
        condition: NOT part of a larger shape AND location/color NOT in `ignored_locations`.
      - object: pixel
        color: gray (5)
        output_color: gray (5)
        condition: NOT part of a larger shape AND location/color NOT in `ignored_locations`.
      - object: square_2x2_magenta
        output_color: magenta (6)
    output_object_ref: hollow_square_4x4_standard

  - action: copy
    description: Copies the object directly to the output grid.
    applies_to:
      - object: L_shape_blue
    result: Identical object shape and color in the output at the same coordinates.

  - action: delete
    description: Object is identified, its pixels marked used, but it's not transferred to the output grid.
    applies_to:
      - object: hollow_square_4x4_yellow

  - action: ignore_pixel
    description: The pixel is identified but explicitly not processed based on its location and color matching the ignore list.
    applies_to:
      - object: pixel
        condition: location and color match one of the `ignored_locations`.

relationships:
  - relationship: object_priority
    description: Multi-pixel shapes (Yellow 4x4, Magenta 2x2, Blue L-shape) are identified first. Their constituent pixels are marked as 'used' and are not considered for single-pixel rules (ignore/transform).
  - relationship: position_mapping
    description: The top-left coordinate of an input object (pixel anchor or shape's top-left anchor) serves as the anchor point (top-left coordinate) for the corresponding output 4x4 hollow square. For copied shapes, coordinates are preserved.
  - relationship: overlap_resolution
    description: Output objects are drawn onto the initially blank (white) grid. Drawing operations overwrite any pixels previously set at overlapping coordinates. Assumed drawing order: Magenta squares, then Blue L-shapes, then single pixel transformations (sorted by anchor).
