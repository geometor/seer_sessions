"""
Identify specific input objects (single pixels of Red, Green, Gray, Blue; 2x2
solid Magenta squares; 4x4 hollow Yellow squares) and apply transformations to
an output grid.

Transformation Rules:
1.  Initialize an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with white (0).
2.  Find all single pixels of Red(2), Green(3), Gray(5), Blue(1).
3.  Find all solid 2x2 squares of Magenta(6).
4.  Find all hollow 4x4 squares of Yellow(4).
5.  Filter the single pixels based on color and order of appearance (top-to-bottom, left-to-right):
    - Keep all Red pixels.
    - Keep all Green pixels *except the second one*.
    - Keep all Gray pixels *except the first one*.
    - Keep all Blue pixels.
6.  Process the filtered pixels and the found shapes:
    - For each kept Red pixel at (r, c): Draw a Yellow(4) 4x4 hollow square anchored at (r, c) on the output.
    - For each kept Green pixel at (r, c): Draw a Blue(1) 4x4 hollow square anchored at (r, c) on the output.
    - For each kept Gray pixel at (r, c): Draw a Gray(5) 4x4 hollow square anchored at (r, c) on the output.
    - For each kept Blue pixel at (r, c): Copy the pixel to the output grid (output[r, c] = 1).
    - For each Magenta 2x2 square with top-left at (r, c): Draw a Magenta(6) 4x4 hollow square anchored at (r, c) on the output.
    - Yellow 4x4 hollow squares are ignored (effectively deleted as the output starts white).
7. Overlapping draws overwrite previous pixel values.
