Initialize a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n2.  Create a set, `used_pixels`, to store coordinates of pixels belonging to identified multi-pixel shapes.\n3.  Define the set of specifically ignored pixel coordinates and colors: `ignored_locations = {(5, 5, 5), (16, 2, 3), (5, 5, 3), (9, 9, 3), (4, 4, 2)}`.\n4.  Identify Multi-Pixel Objects and Reserve Pixels:\n    a.  Scan the grid to find all Yellow(4) 4x4 hollow squares. Add the coordinates of their perimeter pixels to `used_pixels`. Mark these shapes for deletion (no action on output grid).\n    b.  Scan the grid to find all Magenta(6) 2x2 solid squares. For each found square, add its four pixel coordinates to `used_pixels` and record its top-left coordinate (anchor) for later processing.\n    c.  Scan the grid to find all instances of the specific Blue(1) L-shape. For each found shape, add its eight pixel coordinates to `used_pixels` and record the set of these coordinates for later processing.\n5.  Identify Single Pixels for Transformation:\n    a.  Create a list, `pixels_to_transform`.\n    b.  Iterate through every cell (r, c) of the input grid:\n        i.  If the coordinate (r, c) is in `used_pixels`, skip it.\n        ii. Get the color `C` at (r, c). If `C` is Red(2), Green(3), or Gray(5):\n            *   Check if the tuple `(r, c, C)` is in the `ignored_locations` set.\n            *   If it is not ignored, add the pixel's information `{'anchor': (r, c), 'color': C}` to the `pixels_to_transform` list.\n6.  Apply Transformations and Copying to Output Grid:\n    a.  Process the recorded Magenta 2x2 squares: For each recorded anchor (r, c), draw a standard Magenta(6) 4x4 hollow square on the output grid, anchored at (r, c).\n    b.  Process the recorded Blue L-shapes: For each recorded set of coordinates, copy the Blue(1) color to the corresponding coordinates on the output grid.\n    c.  Process the single pixels in `pixels_to_transform` (sorted by anchor `(r,c)` for deterministic overlap): For each pixel `{'anchor': (r, c), 'color': C}`:\n        *   If `C` is Red(2): Draw a standard Yellow(4) 4x4 hollow square on the output grid, anchored at (r, c).\n        *   If `C` is Green(3): Draw a standard Blue(1) 4x4 hollow square on the output grid, anchored at (r, c).\n        *   If `C` is Gray(5): Draw a standard Gray(5) 4x4 hollow square on the output grid, anchored at (r, c).\n7.  Return the final output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\n# --- Helper Functions ---\n\ndef find_yellow_hollow_squares(grid: np.ndarray) -> set[tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"Finds 4x4 hollow yellow squares and returns the set of their perimeter pixels.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    shape_pixels = set()\n    # Use visited_anchors to prevent re-checking from different corners of the same square\n    visited_anchors = set() \n\n    for r in range(rows -
