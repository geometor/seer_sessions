actions:
  - action: transform_to_hollow_square_4x4
    description: Replaces specific input objects/pixels with a 4x4 hollow square anchored at the input's top-left corner.
    applies_to:
      - object: pixel
        color: red (2)
        output_color: yellow (4)
        condition: location is NOT in ignored_locations
      - object: pixel
        color: green (3)
        output_color: blue (1)
        condition: location is NOT in ignored_locations
      - object: pixel
        color: gray (5)
        output_color: gray (5)
        condition: location is NOT in ignored_locations
      - object: square_2x2
        color: magenta (6)
        output_color: magenta (6)
    output_object:
      - object: hollow_square_4x4
        size: 4x4
        anchor: top-left corner of input object
        color: determined by input object/color mapping

  - action: copy
    description: Copies the object directly to the output grid.
    applies_to:
      - object: L_shape_blue
        condition: Matches the specific structure found in train_2
    result: Identical object shape and color in the output at the same coordinates.

  - action: delete
    description: Object is identified but not transferred to the output grid.
    applies_to:
      - object: hollow_square_4x4_yellow

  - action: ignore
    description: The pixel is identified but explicitly not processed based on rules.
    applies_to:
      - object: pixel
        condition: location and color match one of the `ignored_locations`.

relationships:
  - relationship: position_mapping
    description: The top-left coordinate of an input object (pixel or shape bounding box) serves as the anchor point (top-left coordinate) for the corresponding output 4x4 hollow square. For copied shapes, coordinates are preserved.
  - relationship: overlap_resolution
    description: When multiple output shapes (squares or copied objects) occupy the same pixel, the one processed/drawn later takes precedence. Assumes a processing order (e.g., based on input object anchor: top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
  - relationship: object_priority
    description: Multi-pixel shapes (Magenta 2x2, Blue L, Yellow 4x4) are identified first. Their constituent pixels are marked and not considered as individual pixels for transformation/ignore rules.
