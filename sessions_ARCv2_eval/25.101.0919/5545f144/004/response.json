            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous analysis correctly identified the core structural element: vertical separator lines of a uniform, non-background color. It also correctly determined the output grid dimensions based on the position of the *first* such line of the *primary* separator color (the color forming the most lines, with ties broken by the leftmost appearance).\n\nHowever, the transformation logic was incorrect. The assumption that the output was either a simple copy of the first section (if `num_primary_lines != 3`) or a pattern transfer from the last section with a shift (if `num_primary_lines == 3`) failed for `train_1` and `train_3`.\n\nThe current analysis suggests a more unified approach might be needed, potentially always involving pattern extraction from a specific source section relative to the separators, but with placement rules varying based on the number of primary separators (`N`). The exact source section and placement rules for `N=1` and `N=2` remain unclear based on the examples, as simple placement (`r_min`) or shifted placement (`r_min+2`) of unique patterns from the last section (`N+1`) doesn't replicate the expected outputs for `train_1` and `train_3`.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Maintain the logic for identifying the primary separator, output dimensions, and the special case for `N=3` (pattern transfer from last section with `r_min + 2` shift), as this worked for `train_2`.\n2.  Hypothesize a rule for `N != 3`. The most plausible, though currently incorrect based on testing, seems to be extracting unique patterns from the last relevant section (`N+1`) and placing them based on their original row index (`r_min`) without a shift.\n3.  Document this hypothesis (V4 in thought process) clearly, acknowledging its limitations for `train_1` and `train_3`. This provides the clearest path forward for the Coder phase, even if refinement is needed later. The core structure involving separators, sections, and pattern transfer seems likely, even if the details for N=1,2 are wrong.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe previous metrics calculation correctly identified the primary separators, indices, and output dimensions. No new metrics are needed, but the interpretation of how `num_primary_lines` affects the transformation rule is key.\n\n*   **Train 1:** `N=2` primary separators (Green at 8, 17). `W_out=8`. Rule should be the `N!=3` case.\n*   **Train 2:** `N=3` primary separators (Red at 6, 13, 20). `W_out=6`. Rule should be the `N=3` case (pattern transfer + shift).\n*   **Train 3:** `N=1` primary separator (Yellow at 12). `W_out=12`. Rule should be the `N!=3` case.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify all full-height, single-color vertical `separator_lines` whose color is not the `background_color`. Record the color and column index for each.\n3.  Determine the `primary_separator_color` by finding which non-background color forms the maximum number `N` of `separator_lines`. Break ties by choosing the color whose first `separator_line` appears at the smallest column index.\n4.  Get the sorted list of `primary_separator_indices` `[idx_1, idx_2, ..., idx_N]` for the `primary_separator_color`. If no primary separators exist (`N=0`), return the input grid unchanged (or handle as error/empty based on task constraints, assume N>0 here).\n5.  Determine the output grid dimensions: height `H` is the input height, width `W_out` is `idx_1`.\n6.  Create the `output_grid` of size `H` x `W_out`, initialized with the `background_color`.\n7.  Define the `source_section` as the slice of the input grid containing all rows and columns from `idx_N + 1` up to `idx_N + W_out`. Ensure the column indices do not exceed the input grid width (`W_in`). If `idx_N + 1 >= W_in`, the source section is empty.\n8.  Extract unique row patterns from the `source_section`. A pattern is a tuple of pixel values in a row of the source section. Only consider patterns that contain at least one color different from the `background_color`.\n9.  For each unique non-background pattern `P` found, record the minimum row index `r_min` (0-based, relative to the start of the source section/grid) where it first appears in the `source_section`.\n10. Determine the target row `target_row` for placing each pattern `P` in the `output_grid`:\n    *   If `N` (the count of primary separators) is exactly 3, then `target_row = r_min + 2`.\n    *   If `N` is not 3 (e.g., N=1 or N=2), then `target_row = r_min`.\n11. For each unique pattern `P` and its corresponding calculated `target_row`: if `0 <= target_row < H`, place the pattern `P` into the `output_grid` at row `target_row`, overwriting the existing background pixels.\n12. Return the final `output_grid`."
