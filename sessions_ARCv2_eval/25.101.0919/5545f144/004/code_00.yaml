elements:
  - object: grid
    role: input
    properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W_in
      - pixels: color values 0-9
      - background_color: most frequent color value
  - object: vertical_line
    role: separator
    properties:
      - column_index: c_idx
      - color: sep_color (must not be background_color)
      - structure: all pixels in column `c_idx` have `sep_color`
      - span: full height H
  - object: primary_separator_color
    role: structure_delimiter
    properties:
      - color value forming the maximum number of separator_lines (N)
      - tie-breaking: color whose first separator_line has the minimum column_index
  - object: primary_separator_indices
    role: location_markers
    properties:
      - sorted list of column indices [idx_1, idx_2, ..., idx_N] where separator_lines of the primary_separator_color exist
  - object: section
    role: content_area
    properties:
      - contiguous block of columns in the input grid
      - width: w_sec
      - section_index: i (0-based)
      - start_col: calculated based on primary_separator_indices
      - end_col: calculated based on primary_separator_indices
      - section_0: columns 0 to `idx_1 - 1` (width W_out = idx_1)
      - section_k: columns `idx_k + 1` to `idx_{k+1} - 1` (for 1 <= k < N)
      - section_N: columns `idx_N + 1` to `W_in - 1` (or potentially limited width)
  - object: source_section
    role: pattern_origin
    properties:
      - defined as section_N (the columns from `idx_N + 1` up to `idx_N + W_out`)
      - may be truncated if input grid width is insufficient
  - object: pattern
    role: content_element
    properties:
      - a tuple representing a row segment (list of pixel colors) of width W_out
      - extracted from the source_section
      - must contain at least one non-background color
  - object: unique_pattern_set
    role: distinct_content
    properties:
      - set of unique patterns found in the source_section
      - associated_min_row_index (r_min): the minimum row index within the source_section where each unique pattern first appears
  - object: grid
    role: output
    properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W_out
      - initially filled with background_color
      - populated by placing unique patterns according to specific rules

relationships:
  - Output width W_out is determined by the index of the first primary separator line (`idx_1`).
  - The number of primary separator lines (N) determines the transformation logic.
  - The source_section (section N) provides the patterns for the output grid.
  - The placement of patterns depends on N and the pattern's `r_min` in the source_section.

actions:
  - identify: background_color
  - find: all separator_lines and their colors/indices
  - determine: primary_separator_color and primary_separator_indices [idx_1, ..., idx_N]
  - calculate: N = count of primary separators
  - calculate: W_out = idx_1
  - create: output grid O (H x W_out) filled with background_color
  - identify: source_section S (columns idx_N + 1 to idx_N + W_out, bounded by W_in)
  - extract: unique_pattern_set with associated r_min values from S
  - conditional_placement:
    - if N == 3:
      - calculate target_row = r_min + 2
    - else (N != 3):
      - calculate target_row = r_min
    - place: each unique pattern P into output grid O at target_row, if target_row is valid (0 <= target_row < H)
