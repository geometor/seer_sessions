elements:
  - object: grid
    role: input
    properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W_in
      - contains pixels of different colors
      - has a background_color (most frequent color)
      - contains one or more full_height_vertical_lines of a single non-background color (separator_lines)

  - object: vertical_line
    role: separator
    properties:
      - consists of a single color (separator_color)
      - separator_color is not the background_color
      - spans the full grid height H
      - may be multiple lines of the same or different separator_colors

  - object: primary_separator_color
    role: delimiter
    properties:
      - the non-background color that forms the maximum number of separator_lines
      - (tie-breaking rule: choose the color whose first separator_line appears earliest)

  - object: section
    role: content_area
    properties:
      - a contiguous block of columns in the input grid
      - bounded by the grid edges or by separator_lines of the primary_separator_color
      - first_section: columns from 0 to index of first primary separator line - 1
      - last_section: columns from index of last primary separator line + 1 to end (or maybe W_out columns wide?)

  - object: pattern
    role: content_element
    properties:
      - a row segment (list of pixel colors) of width W_out
      - typically contains non-background colors
      - specific patterns are selected from the input grid based on criteria

  - object: grid
    role: output
    properties:
      - height: H (same as input)
      - width: W_out (width of the first_section)
      - initially filled with background_color
      - populated by selected patterns according to a placement rule

relationships:
  - Output grid dimensions (H, W_out) are determined by the input height and the position of the first primary_separator_line.
  - Output grid content is constructed from pattern(s) found in the input grid.
  - The primary_separator_color identifies the key structural boundaries.
  - The last_section (defined by the primary_separator_color) appears relevant for identifying the source pattern(s) (at least in train_2).

actions:
  - identify: background_color
  - identify: all separator_lines and their colors
  - determine: primary_separator_color based on line frequency (and tie-breaker)
  - determine: indices of all primary separator lines
  - determine: output grid dimensions (H, W_out) based on the first primary separator index
  - identify: the last_section (columns after the last primary separator, potentially of width W_out)
  - extract: unique non-background row patterns (P) from the last_section
  - record: the minimum original row index (r_min) within the last_section for each unique pattern P
  - construct: output grid by placing selected patterns (P) at specific rows, potentially derived from r_min (e.g., row r_min + 2, as observed in train_2).
