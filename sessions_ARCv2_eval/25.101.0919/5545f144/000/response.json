These lines act as separators. The output grid is the section of the input grid located to the left of the first (leftmost) separator line encountered. The separator line itself is excluded from the output. The color of the separator line varies between tasks but is consistent within a single task's input grid. The separator color is distinct from the most frequent color (background) in the input grid.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
