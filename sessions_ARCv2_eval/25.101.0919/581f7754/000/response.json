            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels.\n2.  **Background Color:** Each example has a dominant background color (Blue=1 in Ex1, Azure=8 in Ex2, Green=3 in Ex3) which remains largely unchanged.\n3.  **Objects/Shapes:** There are distinct shapes or patterns made of non-background colors. These shapes appear to be the primary elements being manipulated. They are often composite, using 2 or more colors (e.g., Azure frame with Yellow center in Ex1, Blue frame with Red center in Ex3, Green shape with Blue center in Ex2).\n4.  **Marker Elements:** In each example, there seem to be specific pixels or simple shapes (like isolated pixels or lines) that serve as references or markers. Their colors are distinct from the main moving shapes and the background (Yellow in Ex1, Magenta/Yellow in Ex2, Red in Ex3). These markers might remain static or move themselves.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the identified objects/shapes horizontally across the grid. The background and the relative structure of the shapes themselves remain intact during the move. The distance and direction of the horizontal movement appear to be determined by the relationship between the object's horizontal position and the horizontal position of a reference marker.\n6.  **Variability:** While the core idea seems consistent (horizontal movement relative to a marker), the specifics vary:\n    *   Train 1: A single isolated marker pixel seems to define a target column, but the movement isn't perfectly aligning the object centers to it; there's a small offset in some cases.\n    *   Train 2: Involves multiple potential marker types (isolated pixels, a vertical bar) and the markers themselves move, plus some objects appear to move vertically as well as horizontally.\n    *   Train 3: Seems the clearest case where isolated marker pixels define a reference column, and objects move horizontally to align with that column based on their initial horizontal distance from it.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the reference marker pixel (e.g., the isolated marker pixel with the lowest row index). Let its column be `ref_col`.\n      2. For each object, identify its representative column (e.g., center column `obj_col`).\n      3. Calculate horizontal shift `dx = ref_col - obj_col`.\n      4. Apply shift `dx` to the object.\n  - Preservation: The internal structure of objects and the background grid remain unchanged.\n\nVariations:\n  - Marker_Identification: Method to select the specific reference marker pixel might vary.\n  - Movement_Calculation: Exact calculation of `dx` might have adjustments or alternatives (as seen in Train 1 offset, Train 2 complexity).\n  - Marker_Movement: Markers themselves can move (Train 2, Train 3).\n  - Vertical_Shift: Objects might shift vertically in some cases (Train 2).\n```"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Identify the background color (typically the most frequent color in the input grid).\n2.  Identify all distinct objects/shapes in the input grid that are composed of non-background colors. Note their structure, colors, and locations (e.g., center coordinates or bounding box).\n3.  Identify potential marker pixels/shapes. These are often isolated pixels or simple geometric forms (like lines) whose colors are distinct from the background and the main components of the movable objects.\n4.  From the potential markers, determine the single \"reference marker pixel\". A common heuristic is to choose the marker pixel with the lowest row index, breaking ties using the lowest column index. Record the column index of this reference marker pixel (`ref_col`).\n5.  Create the output grid, initially copying the background color from the input grid. Also, place any static markers or markers whose movement is independent of the main objects onto the output grid. (Note: Marker movement rules might be complex as seen in Train 2/3).\n6.  For each identified movable object from step 2:\n    a. Determine the object's representative horizontal position, typically the column index of its center (`obj_col`).\n    b. Calculate the required horizontal shift: `dx = ref_col - obj_col`.\n    c. Determine the object's new position by applying the horizontal shift `dx` to its original coordinates.\n    d. Draw the object (preserving its internal structure and colors) at its new position onto the output grid.\n7.  Return the completed output grid."
