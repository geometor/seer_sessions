Task: Horizontal alignment of objects based on a reference marker column.

Common_Elements:
  - Grid: 2D array of integer colors (0-9).
  - Background: A dominant color filling most of the grid, remains constant.
  - Objects:
    - Type: Contiguous shapes/patterns made of non-background colors.
    - Composition: Can be single-color or multi-color (e.g., frame and center).
    - Property: Have a location (e.g., center coordinates, bounding box).
  - Markers:
    - Type: Pixels or simple shapes (lines) of specific colors, distinct from objects and background.
    - Property: Have a location (coordinates).
    - Role: Act as a reference point for transformation.
    - Behavior: May be static or may move.

Transformation_Rule:
  - Action: Move identified objects horizontally.
  - Vertical_Movement: Generally none for objects (observed only in Train 2 for objects and markers).
  - Horizontal_Movement:
    - Trigger: Presence of marker(s) and object(s).
    - Determinant: The horizontal position (column index) of a specific reference marker pixel.
    - Calculation (Hypothesized based on Train 3):
      1. Identify the reference marker pixel (e.g., the isolated marker pixel with the lowest row index). Let its column be `ref_col`.
      2. For each object, identify its representative column (e.g., center column `obj_col`).
      3. Calculate horizontal shift `dx = ref_col - obj_col`.
      4. Apply shift `dx` to the object.
  - Preservation: The internal structure of objects and the background grid remain unchanged.

Variations:
  - Marker_Identification: Method to select the specific reference marker pixel might vary.
  - Movement_Calculation: Exact calculation of `dx` might have adjustments or alternatives (as seen in Train 1 offset, Train 2 complexity).
  - Marker_Movement: Markers themselves can move (Train 2, Train 3).
  - Vertical_Shift: Objects might shift vertically in some cases (Train 2).
