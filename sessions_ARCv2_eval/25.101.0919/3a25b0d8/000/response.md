Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Background Color:** In both examples, there's a dominant background color (azure/8 in train_1, blue/1 in train_2). This color seems to fill most of the grid and surrounds other structures.
2.  **Container Objects:** There are distinct objects made of a single "container" color (blue/1 in train_1, red/2 in train_2). These containers form closed loops or boundaries.
3.  **Content Pixels:** Inside some containers, there are pixels of different colors ("content"). These content pixels are not the same color as the background or the container itself. Some containers might be empty (contain only the container color or background color).
4.  **Selection Criteria:** Not all containers and their content appear in the output. In train_1, content from three separate blue containers (containing orange/green/yellow, magenta, and maroon respectively) seems relevant. In train_2, only the content from the red container holding yellow/green/azure seems relevant (the other large red shape contains no other colors). This suggests a selection process based on the presence and possibly the nature/quantity of the content.
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves extracting the content from the selected container(s).
6.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is smaller than the input. It appears to be constructed by taking the extracted content patterns, potentially applying a frame using the container color, stacking these patterns vertically (in their original top-to-bottom order from the input), and padding the result with the background color to achieve a uniform width.
7.  **Pattern Repetition/Modification:** In both examples, some rows in the output seem to be duplicated or slightly modified compared to a direct extraction and framing. Specifically, the row corresponding to the `9 9 9` content in train_1 is duplicated, and the row corresponding to the `3 3 3` content in train_2 is duplicated. Other rows in train_1 and train_2 output also show modifications that are not simple duplications.

**Facts (YAML):**

task_description: Extract content patterns from specific containers and reconstruct them vertically in the output grid with framing and padding.

elements:
  - type: background
    color_description: The most frequent color in the input grid, often touching the borders.
    example_1: azure (8)
    example_2: blue (1)
  - type: container
    color_description: A color that forms closed loops surrounding other colors.
    example_1: blue (1)
    example_2: red (2)
    properties:
      - forms_boundary
      - contains_content
  - type: content
    color_description: Pixels located inside a container object that are neither the background color nor the container color.
    example_1_containers:
      - colors: [orange (7), green (3), yellow (4)]
      - colors: [magenta (6)]
      - colors: [maroon (9)]
    example_2_containers:
      - colors: [yellow (4), green (3), azure (8)]
      - colors: [] # Empty container
    properties:
      - enclosed_by_container
      - differs_from_background
      - differs_from_container_color

actions:
  - identify_colors: Determine background and potential container colors.
  - find_containers: Locate all closed loops of the container color.
  - extract_content: For each container, identify the content pixels within its boundary.
  - filter_containers: Select containers that have non-empty content.
  - order_containers: Sort the selected containers based on their vertical position (topmost first) in the input.
  - generate_pattern_rows: For each selected container, process its content row by row:
      - extract_content_row: Get the content pixels for the current row.
      - generate_frame: Create a frame around the content row using the container color. This might involve taking the adjacent container pixels from the input or creating a standard frame (e.g., one pixel on each side).
      - combine: Place the content pixels within the frame.
  - apply_modifications: Check if the content row meets specific criteria (e.g., containing exactly three identical pixels like `9 9 9` or `3 3 3`) and potentially duplicate the combined row in the output sequence. Other modifications might apply based on unclear rules.
  - assemble_output: Stack the generated (and possibly duplicated/modified) pattern rows vertically.
  - finalize_grid: Determine the maximum width of the assembled rows and pad all rows symmetrically with the background color to match this width. Create the final output grid.

relationships:
  - content is inside container
  - container is surrounded by background (usually)
  - output structure is derived from the vertical arrangement of content patterns from input containers.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Roles:** Determine the background color (the most common color, e.g., azure in Ex1, blue in Ex2) and the container color (the color forming closed loops containing other colors, e.g., blue in Ex1, red in Ex2).
2.  **Locate Content:** Find all closed containers made of the container color. For each container, identify the "content" pixels inside it â€“ those pixels that are neither the background color nor the container color.
3.  **Select Containers:** Keep only the containers that have content pixels.
4.  **Order Containers:** Arrange these selected containers based on their original top-to-bottom position in the input grid.
5.  **Extract and Frame Content Rows:** Initialize an empty list to store output rows. For each selected container (in order):
    a.  Consider the minimal bounding box of its content pixels.
    b.  For each row within this bounding box:
        i.  Extract the content pixels for this row.
        ii. Extract the corresponding row segment from the container's boundary pixels in the input grid (the frame).
        iii. Create a new row pattern by placing the extracted content pixels into their corresponding positions within the extracted frame segment.
        iv. Append this new row pattern to the list of output rows.
        v. **Apply Duplication Rule:** If the *content pixels* extracted in step (i) consisted of exactly three pixels of the identical color (like `9 9 9` or `3 3 3`), append the row pattern created in step (iii) to the list *again*. (Note: This rule may need refinement based on the coder phase, especially for cases like T2's `8 8 8` pattern).
6.  **Assemble and Pad:** Determine the width of the widest row pattern in the list. Pad all rows in the list symmetrically with the background color on the left and right until they all match this maximum width.
7.  **Final Output:** Stack the padded rows vertically to form the final output grid.
