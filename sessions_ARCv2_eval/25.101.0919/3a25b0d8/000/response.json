            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Background Color:** In both examples, there's a dominant background color (azure/8 in train_1, blue/1 in train_2). This color seems to fill most of the grid and surrounds other structures.\n2.  **Container Objects:** There are distinct objects made of a single \"container\" color (blue/1 in train_1, red/2 in train_2). These containers form closed loops or boundaries.\n3.  **Content Pixels:** Inside some containers, there are pixels of different colors (\"content\"). These content pixels are not the same color as the background or the container itself. Some containers might be empty (contain only the container color or background color).\n4.  **Selection Criteria:** Not all containers and their content appear in the output. In train_1, content from three separate blue containers (containing orange/green/yellow, magenta, and maroon respectively) seems relevant. In train_2, only the content from the red container holding yellow/green/azure seems relevant (the other large red shape contains no other colors). This suggests a selection process based on the presence and possibly the nature/quantity of the content.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves extracting the content from the selected container(s).\n6.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is smaller than the input. It appears to be constructed by taking the extracted content patterns, potentially applying a frame using the container color, stacking these patterns vertically (in their original top-to-bottom order from the input), and padding the result with the background color to achieve a uniform width.\n7.  **Pattern Repetition/Modification:** In both examples, some rows in the output seem to be duplicated or slightly modified compared to a direct extraction and framing. Specifically, the row corresponding to the `9 9 9` content in train_1 is duplicated, and the row corresponding to the `3 3 3` content in train_2 is duplicated. Other rows in train_1 and train_2 output also show modifications that are not simple duplications.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n```"

Extract the content pixels for this row.\n        ii. Extract the corresponding row segment from the container's boundary pixels in the input grid (the frame).\n        iii.

Pad all rows in the list symmetrically with the background color on the left and right until they all match this maximum width.\n7.  **Final Output:** Stack the padded rows vertically to form the final output grid."
