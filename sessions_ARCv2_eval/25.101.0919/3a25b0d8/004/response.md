**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous attempt failed primarily due to inaccurate **pattern extraction** and an incorrect **duplication rule**.

1.  **Pattern Extraction:** The code did not correctly isolate the "true content" pixels and their immediate "container" frame. It often grabbed overly large bounding boxes or misidentified the constituent pixels of the pattern. The extraction needs to be more precise: first identify the true content pixels associated with a container object, then identify only the container pixels directly adjacent (8-way connectivity) to that content, and finally compute the minimal bounding box containing *only* these two sets of pixels.
2.  **Duplication Rule:** The `X X X` rule for row duplication was insufficient. It correctly handled the `9 9 9` case in Example 1 but failed for others. Analyzing the expected outputs suggests a new hypothesis: **A row is duplicated if its *true content pixels* (excluding the background and container frame colors) form a horizontally symmetrical pattern within that row.** This accounts for `777`, `999` (Ex1) and `44..44`, `333`, `8` (Ex2).
3.  **Container Identification:** The heuristic used (most diverse adjacencies) seemed to work for the examples but needs robust implementation.

The strategy is to:
*   Implement the refined pattern extraction logic (content + adjacent frame -> bounding box).
*   Implement the row duplication rule based on horizontal symmetry of the true content within the row.
*   Refine container and background identification if necessary.
*   Ensure correct sorting of patterns and final padding.

**Metrics and Observations:**

*   **Example 1 Results:**
    *   The transformed output had incorrect rows and dimensions, indicating failed pattern extraction.
    *   It correctly duplicated the row with `9 9 9` content based on the old rule.
    *   It failed to duplicate the row with `7 7 7` content (likely due to incorrect extraction preventing the rule check).
    *   The extracted subgrids were mixed with background/other patterns.
*   **Example 2 Results:**
    *   Pattern extraction failed significantly, producing rows unrelated to the expected output structure.
    *   The code incorrectly duplicated a row containing `8 8 8` (which included container color `2`), violating the old rule's intent and the expected output.
    *   The code failed to duplicate rows with content `4 4 ... 4 4`, `3 3 3`, and `8`, which are duplicated in the expected output and fit the new symmetry hypothesis.

  - find_true_content_objects: Locate all connected objects of non-background, non-container colors.
  - group_content_and_extract_patterns:
      1. For each true_content_object (TCO):
          a. Find all container_object pixels adjacent (8-way) to TCO ('adjacent_frame').
          b. If 'adjacent_frame' is non-empty:
              i. Combine coordinates: `pattern_coords = TCO_coords U adjacent_frame_coords`.
              ii. Calculate the minimal bounding box (BB) enclosing `pattern_coords`.
              iii. Extract the subgrid ('pattern') using BB.

  - assemble_and_duplicate_rows:

          a. Add the row to the final list.
          b. Extract the 'true_content' pixels from the row (pixels != background and != container_color).
          c. Check if the sequence of true_content pixels is a horizontal palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

  - pad_rows: Calculate the maximum width among rows in the final list. Pad each row symmetrically with the background color to match this width.

relationships:
  - pattern_content_pixels are adjacent to pattern_frame_pixels.
  - pattern is the minimal bounding box of pattern_content_pixels and pattern_frame_pixels.
  - output_rows are derived from pattern rows.
  - output_row duplication depends on content symmetry.
  - final_grid is composed of padded output_rows.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colors:** Determine the `background_color` (most frequent pixel) and the `container_color` (the non-background color adjacent to the most *diverse* set of other non-background colors).
2.  **Locate Content Blobs:** Find all distinct connected objects (`content_blobs`) composed of pixels that are *neither* the `background_color` *nor* the `container_color`.
3.  **Extract Patterns:** Initialize an empty list to store extracted `patterns` and a set to track processed `content_blob` coordinates.
    For each `content_blob`:
    a.  If its coordinates have already been processed, skip it.
    b.  Find the set of all `container_color` pixel coordinates (`frame_pixels`) that are directly adjacent (8-way connectivity) to any pixel in the `content_blob`.
    c.  If no `frame_pixels` are found, skip this `content_blob`.
    d.  Combine the coordinates: `pattern_pixels = content_blob_coords U frame_pixels`.
    e.  Calculate the minimum bounding box (`pattern_bb`) enclosing all `pattern_pixels`.
    f.  Extract the rectangular subgrid (`pattern`) from the input grid defined by `pattern_bb`.
    g.  Record the `pattern` along with the minimum row index found within the `content_blob_coords`.
    h.  Mark all `content_blob_coords` as processed.
4.  **Sort Patterns:** Order the recorded `patterns` based on their stored minimum content row index (top to bottom).
5.  **Assemble and Duplicate Rows:**
    a.  Create an initial list, `assembled_rows`, by concatenating all rows from the sorted `patterns` in sequence.
    b.  Create a final list, `final_rows`. Iterate through each `row` in `assembled_rows`:
        i.  Add the `row` to `final_rows`.
        ii. Extract the sequence of `true_content_pixels` from the `row` (those pixels not matching `background_color` or `container_color`).
        iii. If the `true_content_pixels` sequence is not empty and reads the same forwards and backwards (is a palindrome), add the `row` to `final_rows` again.
6.  **Pad and Finalize:** Calculate the maximum width among all rows in `final_rows`. Pad each row symmetrically (left and right) with the `background_color` to match this maximum width. Stack the padded rows vertically to form the final output grid.
