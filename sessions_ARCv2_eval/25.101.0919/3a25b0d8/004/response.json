            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe previous attempt failed primarily due to inaccurate **pattern extraction** and an incorrect **duplication rule**.\n\n1.  **Pattern Extraction:** The code did not correctly isolate the \"true content\" pixels and their immediate \"container\" frame. It often grabbed overly large bounding boxes or misidentified the constituent pixels of the pattern. The extraction needs to be more precise: first identify the true content pixels associated with a container object, then identify only the container pixels directly adjacent (8-way connectivity) to that content, and finally compute the minimal bounding box containing *only* these two sets of pixels.\n2.  **Duplication Rule:** The `X X X` rule for row duplication was insufficient. It correctly handled the `9 9 9` case in Example 1 but failed for others. Analyzing the expected outputs suggests a new hypothesis: **A row is duplicated if its *true content pixels* (excluding the background and container frame colors) form a horizontally symmetrical pattern within that row.** This accounts for `777`, `999` (Ex1) and `44..44`, `333`, `8` (Ex2).\n3.  **Container Identification:** The heuristic used (most diverse adjacencies) seemed to work for the examples but needs robust implementation.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n*   Implement the refined pattern extraction logic (content + adjacent frame -> bounding box).\n*   Implement the row duplication rule based on horizontal symmetry of the true content within the row.\n*   Refine container and background identification if necessary.\n*   Ensure correct sorting of patterns and final padding.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\n*   **Example 1 Results:**\n    *   The transformed output had incorrect rows and dimensions, indicating failed pattern extraction.\n    *   It correctly duplicated the row with `9 9 9` content based on the old rule.\n    *   It failed to duplicate the row with `7 7 7` content (likely due to incorrect extraction preventing the rule check).\n    *   The extracted subgrids were mixed with background/other patterns.\n*   **Example 2 Results:**\n    *   Pattern extraction failed significantly, producing rows unrelated to the expected output structure.\n    *   The code incorrectly duplicated a row containing `8 8 8` (which included container color `2`), violating the old rule's intent and the expected output.\n    *   The code failed to duplicate rows with content `4 4 ... 4 4`, `3 3 3`, and `8`, which are duplicated in the expected output and fit the new symmetry hypothesis.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
