            "text": "Okay, let's refine the analysis based on the results and the failed first attempt.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial code failed primarily because it incorrectly identified which objects were \"containers\" and how to extract the relevant \"pattern\" (content + frame). It grabbed large bounding boxes including multiple distinct patterns and also misidentified some colors as containers when they should have been content, and vice versa. The duplication rule was also likely inaccurate.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Precisely Define \"Container\" and \"Content\":** A container isn't just any non-background object. It seems to be an object of a specific color (blue=1 in Ex1, red=2 in Ex2) that directly encloses pixels of *other* non-background colors (the content). Objects of the container color that *don't* enclose other non-background colors should be ignored. Objects of *other* colors are content, not containers.\n2.  **Refine Pattern Extraction:** Instead of using broad bounding boxes, the extraction should focus tightly on the content and its immediate container frame. We need to extract the subgrid that represents the content framed by its specific container pixels.\n3.  **Re-evaluate the Duplication Rule:** The previous `X X X` content rule needs re-examination against the examples. The symmetry hypothesis also failed. We need a rule that correctly predicts duplication for rows containing `777`, `999` (Ex1) and `44..44`, `333`, `8` (Ex2), while *not* duplicating others like `66..66` or `888`. A simple rule is elusive; let's stick to the `X X X` content rule for now as it covers *some* cases, acknowledging it might be incomplete.\n4.  **Use Metrics:** Validate assumptions about background, container color, and extracted pattern dimensions against the expected output.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (Code Execution):**\n\nThe previous code execution already revealed the core issue: the pattern identification logic was flawed, leading to incorrect bounding boxes and content identification.\n*   **Ex1:** Background=8. True Container=1. Content=7,3,4,6,9. The code incorrectly found BBox(8,10)-(16,20) for container 1, mixing patterns. It also misidentified 7,3,4 as containers.\n*   **Ex2:** Background=1. True Container=2. Content=4,3,8. The code incorrectly found BBox(2,1)-(10,7) for container 2. It also misidentified 3,8 as containers.\n\nThis confirms the need for a better method to isolate the *correct* container objects and extract only their specific content+frame.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
