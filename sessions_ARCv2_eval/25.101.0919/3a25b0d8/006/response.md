**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous attempt failed significantly in the **pattern extraction** phase. The logic of finding content blobs first and then looking for adjacent container pixels resulted in fragmented and incorrect subgrids being identified as patterns. The transformed outputs bear little resemblance to the expected outputs in terms of shape, content, and structure.

The **duplication rule** based on palindromic true content appears consistent with the *expected* outputs, but the incorrect pattern extraction meant this rule was applied to the wrong rows or not tested correctly.

The **container identification** heuristic (most diverse adjacencies) seemed to work for the training examples, but the subsequent pattern extraction failure prevented proper validation.

**Strategy Revision:**

1.  **Pattern Extraction Focus:** The core issue is isolating the correct "pattern" which consists of a blob of "true content" pixels *and* its immediately adjacent "container color" frame pixels. The revised strategy will be:
    *   Identify background (`B`) and container (`C`) colors.
    *   Find all connected objects of `C` (`container_objects`).
    *   Find all connected objects of "true content" colors (`T` = any color not `B` or `C`) (`content_objects`).
    *   **Associate Content with Containers:** For each `content_object`, find which `container_object`(s) its pixels are adjacent to (8-way). Group `content_objects` based on the `container_object` they primarily interact with (e.g., the one they share the most adjacent pixels with, or simply the first one found - need a clear rule). A single `content_object` should ideally be associated with only one `pattern` extraction.
    *   **Define Pattern Boundaries:** For each associated (`content_object`, `container_object`) pair:
        *   `ContentCoords` = coordinates of the `content_object`.
        *   `FrameCoords` = coordinates of the `container_object` pixels that are adjacent (8-way) to any pixel in `ContentCoords`.
        *   `PatternCoords` = `ContentCoords` U `FrameCoords`.
        *   Calculate the minimal bounding box (`PatternBB`) containing `PatternCoords`.
        *   Extract the subgrid (`Pattern`) from the input grid using `PatternBB`.
    *   Store the `Pattern` along with the minimum row index from `ContentCoords` for sorting. Use a mechanism to prevent re-extracting based on the same `content_object`.
2.  **Duplication Rule:** Maintain the rule: duplicate a row if its `true_content_pixels` (pixels != B and != C) form a non-empty palindrome.
3.  **Sorting and Padding:** Maintain sorting by the minimum row of the original content and symmetric padding with the background color.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Based on visual inspection of the expected outputs vs. inputs and the failed transformed outputs:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Background:** 8 (Azure) - Correctly identified.
    *   **Container:** 1 (Blue) - Correctly identified by heuristic.
    *   **True Content:** 7 (Orange), 3 (Green), 4 (Yellow), 6 (Magenta), 9 (Maroon).
    *   **Expected Patterns (Visual Estimate):**
        1.  Top-left Blue container + Orange/Green/Yellow content -> BBox approx (8,10) to (13,20) -> Output rows 1-6.
        2.  Middle Blue container + Magenta content -> BBox approx (14,13) to (15,19) -> Output rows 7-8.
        3.  Bottom Blue container + Maroon content -> BBox approx (16,14) to (17,18) -> Output rows 9-11.
    *   **Failure Analysis:** The previous code extracted tiny, incorrect fragments (e.g., `[1, 7, 7, 7, 1]`, `[1, 4, 1, 4, 1]`) and incorrectly applied duplication, leading to a mismatched output structure and size. Padding was applied based on these incorrect fragments.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Background:** 1 (Blue) - Correctly identified.
    *   **Container:** 2 (Red) - Correctly identified by heuristic.
    *   **True Content:** 4 (Yellow), 3 (Green), 8 (Azure).
    *   **Expected Patterns (Visual Estimate):**
        1.  Large Red container + Yellow/Green/Azure content -> BBox approx (0,1) to (11,7) -> Output rows 1-13. (Note: The other red shapes in the input are empty of true content and should be ignored).
    *   **Failure Analysis:** The previous code extracted even more severely fragmented patterns (e.g., `[2, 4, 4, 2]`, `[2, 2, 3, 2, 2]`) from various parts of the grid, failing entirely to capture the main structure. Duplication and padding were applied incorrectly.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Roles:** Determine the `background_color` (most frequent pixel) and the `container_color` (the non-background color adjacent to the most diverse set of other non-background colors).
2.  **Locate Objects:** Find all distinct, connected objects composed solely of the `container_color` (`container_objects`). Find all distinct, connected objects composed of any single color that is *neither* the `background_color` *nor* the `container_color` (`content_objects`).
3.  **Map Content to Patterns:** Initialize an empty list to store `pattern_definitions` and a set to track coordinates of `content_objects` already assigned to a pattern.
    For each `content_object`:
    a.  If its coordinates overlap with the set of already processed coordinates, skip it.
    b.  Find the set of all `container_color` pixel coordinates (`frame_coords`) that are directly adjacent (8-way connectivity) to any pixel coordinate within the current `content_object`.
    c.  If `frame_coords` is empty (the content object doesn't touch the container color), skip this `content_object`.
    d.  Store a `pattern_definition` containing:
        *   `content_coords`: The coordinates of the current `content_object`.
        *   `frame_coords`: The identified adjacent `container_color` coordinates.
        *   `sort_key`: The minimum row index found within `content_coords`.
    e.  Add all coordinates from `content_coords` to the set of processed coordinates.
4.  **Extract and Sort Patterns:**
    a.  Initialize an empty list `extracted_patterns`.
    b.  For each `pattern_definition` stored in the previous step:
        i.  Combine coordinates: `pattern_coords = content_coords U frame_coords`.
        ii. Calculate the minimal bounding box (`pattern_bb`) enclosing `pattern_coords`.
        iii. Extract the rectangular subgrid (`pattern_grid`) from the input grid defined by `pattern_bb`.
        iv. Add the pair (`sort_key`, `pattern_grid`) to the `extracted_patterns` list.
    c.  Sort the `extracted_patterns` list based on the `sort_key` (ascending).
5.  **Assemble and Duplicate Rows:**
    a.  Create an initial list, `assembled_rows`, by concatenating all rows (as lists of pixel values) from the `pattern_grid`s in the sorted `extracted_patterns` list, maintaining their order.
    b.  Create a final list, `final_rows`. Iterate through each `row` in `assembled_rows`:
        i.  Add the `row` to `final_rows`.
        ii. Extract the sequence of `true_content_pixels` from the `row` (those pixels whose color is not `background_color` and not `container_color`).
        iii. If the `true_content_pixels` sequence is not empty and reads the same forwards and backwards (is a palindrome), add the `row` to `final_rows` again.
6.  **Pad and Finalize:** Calculate the maximum width among all rows in `final_rows`. For each row, calculate the total padding needed (`max_width - current_width`), divide it into left and right padding amounts (integer division for left, remainder added to right for symmetry), and prepend/append the required number of `background_color` pixels. Stack these padded rows vertically to create the final output grid.
