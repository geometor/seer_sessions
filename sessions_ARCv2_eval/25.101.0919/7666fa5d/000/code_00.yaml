task_elements:
  - item: grid_properties
    properties:
      - size: 16x16 (for these examples)
      - background_color: azure (8)
      - fill_color: red (2) # Color used to fill regions
  - item: objects
    type: marker_pixels
    properties:
      - colors: [yellow (4), green (3)] # Colors that define regions
      - role: Define the vertices/boundary of regions to be filled
      - grouping: Appear in spatially distinct clusters in the examples
  - item: transformation
    action: fill_region
    using: convex_hull
    details:
      - Identify groups/clusters of marker pixels of the same color.
      - For each group, compute its convex hull.
      - Identify all grid coordinates strictly inside the convex hull.
      - Change background pixels (azure 8) at these interior coordinates to the fill color (red 2).
  - item: relationships
    relation: enclosure
    subject: marker_pixels (grouped by color and proximity)
    object: background_pixels (azure 8)
    description: Groups of marker pixels enclose regions of the background.
    result: Enclosed background pixels are recolored to red (2).
  - item: invariance
    properties:
      - Grid size remains constant.
      - Positions and colors of original marker pixels are preserved.
      - Background pixels outside the filled regions are preserved.
