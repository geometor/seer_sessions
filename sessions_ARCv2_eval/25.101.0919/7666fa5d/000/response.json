Perception**\n\n*   The input and output grids are the same size (16x16).\n*   The dominant color in the input grids is azure (8), which acts as the background.\n*   Scattered across the background are pixels of another color: yellow (4) in the first example, and green (3) in the second. These act as 'marker' pixels.\n*   In the output grids, the original background and marker pixels remain unchanged.\n*   A new color, red (2), appears in the output grid.\n*   The red pixels fill areas that seem to be enclosed or defined by groups of the marker pixels (yellow or green).\n*   The marker pixels appear in spatially distinct clusters in both examples.\n*   The shape of the red filled area corresponds closely to the convex hull of the marker pixels within each cluster. The fill occurs only where the original pixel was the background color (azure).\n\n**2. Facts**\n\n"
