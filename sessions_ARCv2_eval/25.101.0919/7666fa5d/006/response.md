**Assessment**

The provided code, intended to fill the convex hull of marker pixel clusters, failed on both training examples by returning the input grid unchanged. The previous modification, changing the `contains_point` check from strictly inside (`radius=-1e-9`) to inside-or-on-boundary (`radius=0`), did not resolve the issue. This indicates the problem likely lies deeper than just the boundary condition for pixel centers.

Possible reasons for failure include:
1.  **Coordinate System Mismatch:** Subtle errors in converting between grid indices `(row, col)` and geometric coordinates `(x, y)` for the `ConvexHull` and `Path` libraries.
2.  **Point-in-Polygon Logic:** The `matplotlib.path.Path.contains_point` function, even with `radius=0`, might not behave as expected when testing pixel centers (`c + 0.5, r + 0.5`) against the hull defined by other pixel centers/coordinates. Floating-point precision could also play a role.
3.  **Algorithm Choice:** Using continuous geometric algorithms (convex hull, point-in-polygon) for a discrete grid task might require a different approach, such as polygon rasterization directly onto the grid.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Coordinates:** Double-check the coordinate transformations (`(row, col)` to `(col, row)`).
2.  **Test Point Definition:** Experiment with testing integer coordinates `(c, r)` instead of centers `(c + 0.5, r + 0.5)` in `contains_point`, although centers seem more geometrically correct.
3.  **Alternative Fill Algorithm:** If standard point-in-polygon tests continue to fail, implement a grid-based polygon filling (rasterization) technique. A simple approach is scanline filling: for each row within the hull's bounding box, determine the horizontal segment(s) of that row covered by the polygon and fill the corresponding background pixels.
4.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the working algorithm.

**Metrics**

The metrics confirm the nature of the input and expected output, highlighting the number of marker pixels and the number of pixels that *should* have been filled.
