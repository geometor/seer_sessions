task_elements:
  - item: grid_properties
    properties:
      - size: Variable (e.g., 16x16 in examples)
      - background_color: The most frequent color in the input grid (azure 8 in examples).
      - fill_color: red (2) # Color used to fill regions.
  - item: objects
    type: marker_pixels
    properties:
      - colors: Any color present that is not the background color (e.g., yellow 4, green 3).
      - role: Define the vertices/boundary of regions to be filled.
      - grouping_method: Clustered based on 8-way connectivity (adjacent including diagonals). Each contiguous group of same-colored marker pixels forms a cluster.
  - item: transformation
    action: fill_convex_hull_interior_or_boundary # Action name updated
    details:
      - Identify the background color.
      - Identify all unique marker colors.
      - For each marker color:
          - Find all pixels of that marker color.
          - Group these pixels into clusters using 8-way connectivity.
          - For each cluster containing 3 or more marker pixels:
              - Compute the convex hull of the coordinates of the pixels in the cluster.
              - Identify all grid coordinates `(row, column)` whose centers lie *inside or on the boundary* of this convex hull polygon. # Condition modified
              - For each such coordinate, if its color in the *original input* grid was the background color, change its color to the fill color (red 2) in the output grid.
  - item: relationships
    relation: enclosure_by_convex_hull
    subject: Clusters of marker_pixels (grouped by color and 8-way connectivity)
    object: background_pixels
    description: Clusters of 3 or more marker pixels define a convex hull. Background pixels whose centers are inside or on the boundary of this hull are affected. # Description modified
    result: Affected background pixels are recolored to red (2).
  - item: invariance
    properties:
      - Grid size remains constant.
      - Positions and colors of original marker pixels are preserved.
      - Background pixels outside the filled regions (i.e., centers outside the hull) are preserved.
