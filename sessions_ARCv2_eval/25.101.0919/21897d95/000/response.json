The bottom-most region seems significant.\n5.  **Rotation:** Across all examples, the output grid dimensions are the transpose of the input grid dimensions (Height x Width -> Width x Height). This strongly suggests a 90-degree rotation (clockwise or counter-clockwise). Comparing the arrangement of shapes confirms a 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n6.  **Color Mapping:** After rotation, the colors of the regions change. This mapping is not fixed pixel-to-pixel based on the original color but depends on the *region* a pixel belonged to in the original input.\n7.  **Background Region:** The region touching the bottom edge of the *original* input grid (the \"background\" region) appears to be treated differently from the other regions (\"foreground\" regions) sitting above it.\n8.  **Foreground Mapping:** Foreground regions seem to map to a new color determined by a specific rule or map (`M`) for that task instance. Noise pixels within a foreground region adopt the mapped color of that region.\n9.  **Background Mapping:** Pixels originating from the background region adopt a color based on the foreground region immediately adjacent to them. Specifically, after rotation, the background region (now typically on the right side) seems to take on the color of the region to its left *in the same row* of the output grid. This implies a horizontal propagation of color.\n\n**YAML Fact Document**\n\n"

Distinguish the \"background\" region(s) (touching the bottom edge of the input) from the \"foreground\" regions (those above the background). Note the primary color of each region.\n2.  **Determine Color Map:** Observe the color changes between the input foreground regions and their corresponding regions in the output grid (accounting for rotation). Define a color map `M` where `M[input_foreground_region_color] = output_color`.\n3.  **Rotate:** Rotate the entire input grid 90 degrees clockwise.\n4.  **Initial Coloring:** Create a new grid (the size of the rotated grid). Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the rotated grid. Find the color and region type of the corresponding pixel in the *original* input grid.\n    *   If the original pixel belonged to a foreground region with color `C`, set the new grid pixel `(r, c)` to `M[C]`. Handle noise pixels by using the map for their encompassing region's color.\n    *   If the original pixel belonged to the background region, mark the new grid pixel `(r, c)` as a special placeholder (e.g., -1).\n5.  **Propagate Background Color:** Iterate through the new grid, row by row, from left to right (column index `c` from 0 upwards). Keep track of the last non-placeholder color encountered (`last_color`) in the current row.\n    *   If the current pixel `(r, c)` is not a placeholder, update `last_color` with its value.\n    *   If the current pixel `(r, c)` is a placeholder, change its value to `last_color`. (If the leftmost pixel(s) are placeholders, they need a default behavior, potentially propagating from the right or using a default color, though based on examples, propagation from the left seems sufficient).\n6.  **Final Output:** The resulting grid after propagation is the final output."
