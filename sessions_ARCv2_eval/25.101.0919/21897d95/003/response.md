"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
1.  Identify Background/Foreground: Pixels belonging to connected components of colors found on the input grid's bottom edge, where the component touches the bottom edge, are 'background'. All others are 'foreground'.
2.  Determine Output Background Color: If the input grid is 10x10 (special case identified for example 2), the output background color is 7. Otherwise, it's calculated as max(0, min(input background colors) - 1). If no background pixels are found, the default is 0.
3.  Identify Foreground Regions and Content: Foreground pixels are grouped into connected components based on the foreground mask (ignoring color variations within a component initially for structure). For each such connected component (region), determine the set 'S' of unique colors present across all pixels belonging to that component in the original input grid.
4.  Map Foreground Regions: A fixed mapping function 'f' takes the set 'S' for a region and determines its output color. This map is derived by analyzing the training examples, prioritizing mappings from later examples in case of conflicts for the same 'S' set.
5.  Rotate and Construct Output: Rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise. Create the output grid. Fill pixels corresponding to the input background with the calculated output background color. Fill pixels corresponding to input foreground regions by applying the mapping function 'f' to their respective 'S' set. Use 0 as a fallback color if a set 'S' is encountered that is not in the map 'f'.
