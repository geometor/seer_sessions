For each such row, it analyzes the segment between the Red markers to determine the single best repeating pattern unit. The \"best\" unit is defined as the shortest sub-sequence that, when repeated, maximizes the number of matching pixels with the original segment. This identified pattern unit is then used to completely reconstruct the segment in the output grid, effectively correcting any deviations from the dominant pattern.\n\n1.  **Initialize Output:** Create an exact, independent copy of the input grid.\n2.  **Iterate Rows:** Process each row `r` of the input grid.\n3.  **Identify Pattern Rows:** Check if `grid[r][1] == 2` and `grid[r][width-2] == 2`.\n4.  **Process Pattern Rows:**\n    a.  Extract the segment `input_segment = grid[r][2 : width-2]`.\n    b.  Determine the best repeating pattern unit (`PUnit`) for `input_segment` using `_find_best_pattern`.\n    c.  If `PUnit` is found, apply it to the output grid: For columns `c` from 2 to `width-3`, set `output_grid[r][c] = PUnit[(c - 2) % len(PUnit)]`.\n5.  **Return Output:** Return the modified grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _find_best_pattern(segment: list[int]) -> list[int] | None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the best repeating pattern unit for a given segment.\n\n    The \"best\" pattern is the shortest one that achieves the maximum score,\n    where the score is the number of matches when the pattern is repeated\n    over the entire segment.\n\n    Args:\n        segment: The list of pixel values in the row segment.\n\n    Returns:\n        The best pattern unit (list of ints) or None if the segment is empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(segment)\n    if n == 0:\n        return None\n\n    best_pattern = None\n    max_score = -1\n    min_len_for_max_score = float('inf')\n\n    # Iterate through possible pattern lengths (limit to reasonable max, e.g., n or 8)\n    max_pattern_len = min(n, 10) # Increased max length slightly just in case\n    for length in range(1, max_pattern_len + 1):\n        # Iterate through all possible starting positions for a pattern of this length\n        for i in range(n - length + 1):\n            candidate_pattern = segment[i : i + length]\n\n            # Score the candidate pattern by counting matches over the whole segment\n            current_score = 0\n            for j in range(n):\n                if segment[j] == candidate_pattern[j % length]:\n                    current_score += 1\n\n            # Update best pattern if this one is better\n            if current_score > max_score:\n                max_score = current_score\n                best_pattern = candidate_pattern\n                min_len_for_max_score = length\n            elif current_score == max_score:\n                # If scores are equal, prefer the shorter pattern\n                if length < min_len_for_max_score:\n                    best_pattern = candidate_pattern\n                    min_len_for_max_score = length\n                # Optional: If lengths are also equal, could prefer the one starting earlier (i)\n                # but seems unnecessary based on examples.\n\n    # If multiple equally short patterns have the best score,\n    # this picks the one encountered last during the scan for that length.\n    # This seems acceptable.\n    return best_pattern\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies rows with patterns flanked by Red(2) pixels and corrects\n    deviations within those patterns based on the best repeating unit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # initialize output_grid as a deep copy\n    output_grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid] # shallow copy row-by-row\n    height = len(input_grid)\n    if height == 0:\n        return []\n    width = len(input_grid[0])\n    # Need at least 4 columns for a pattern row: Border, Red, Pattern..., Red, Border\n    if width < 4:\n        return output_grid\n\n    # iterate through each row\n    for r in range(height):\n        # identify pattern rows: check for Red(2) markers at col 1 and width-2\n        if input_grid[r][1] == 2 and input_grid[r][width - 2] == 2:\n\n            # extract the segment between the markers\n            input_segment = input_grid[r][2 : width - 2]\n\n            # skip if segment is empty\n            if not input_segment:\n                continue\n\n            # determine the best repeating pattern unit for this segment\n            pattern_unit = _find_best_pattern(input_segment)\n\n            # if a pattern unit was successfully determined\n            if pattern_unit:\n                pattern_len = len(pattern_unit)\n                # apply the pattern to correct the segment in the output grid\n                for c in range(2, width - 2):\n                    # calculate the index within the pattern unit\n                    pattern_index = (c - 2) % pattern_len\n                    # get the expected color from the pattern unit\n                    expected_color = pattern_unit[pattern_index]\n                    # update the output grid\n                    output_grid[r][c] = expected_color\n\n    # return the modified grid\n    return output_grid\n```"
