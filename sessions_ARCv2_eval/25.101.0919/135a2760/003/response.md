"""
The transformation rule identifies specific rows in the input grid that contain a repeating horizontal pattern flanked by Red (2) pixels. For each such row, it analyzes the segment between the Red markers to determine the single best repeating pattern unit. The "best" unit is defined as the shortest sub-sequence that, when repeated, maximizes the number of matching pixels with the original segment. This identified pattern unit is then used to completely reconstruct the segment in the output grid, effectively correcting any deviations from the dominant pattern.

1.  **Initialize Output:** Create an exact, independent copy of the input grid.
2.  **Iterate Rows:** Process each row `r` of the input grid.
3.  **Identify Pattern Rows:** Check if `grid[r][1] == 2` and `grid[r][width-2] == 2`.
4.  **Process Pattern Rows:**
    a.  Extract the segment `input_segment = grid[r][2 : width-2]`.
    b.  Determine the best repeating pattern unit (`PUnit`) for `input_segment` using `_find_best_pattern`.
    c.  If `PUnit` is found, apply it to the output grid: For columns `c` from 2 to `width-3`, set `output_grid[r][c] = PUnit[(c - 2) % len(PUnit)]`.
5.  **Return Output:** Return the modified grid.
