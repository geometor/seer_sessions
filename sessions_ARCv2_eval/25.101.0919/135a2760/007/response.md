"""
The transformation rule identifies specific rows in the input grid that contain a 
repeating horizontal pattern flanked by Red (2) pixels. For each such row, it 
analyzes the segment between the Red markers to determine the single best *simple* 
repeating pattern unit. The "best" unit is defined as the shortest sub-sequence 
(up to a maximum length of 6) that, when repeated, maximizes the number of matching 
pixels with the original segment. This identified pattern unit is then used to 
completely reconstruct the segment in the output grid, effectively correcting any 
deviations from the dominant simple pattern.
