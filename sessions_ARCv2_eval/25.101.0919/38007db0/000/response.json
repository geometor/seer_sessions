            "text": "**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: Both input examples show a grid composed of smaller, repeating blocks or patterns. These blocks are separated by single-pixel lines (horizontal and vertical) of a specific color (blue in `train_1`, green in `train_2`).\n2.  **Block Pattern**: Each block consists of a 5x5 pattern area surrounded by the separator lines. Inside the 5x5 area, there's an outer frame of one color (magenta in `train_1`, yellow in `train_2`) and an inner pattern made of another color (yellow in `train_1`, blue in `train_2`).\n3.  **Variability**: Within the input grid, most of the 5x5 inner patterns are identical, but one or more patterns are different. These different patterns appear to be variations of the common pattern.\n4.  **Transformation**: The output grid retains the vertical structure (number of blocks stacked vertically and separator lines) but reduces the horizontal structure to just one column of blocks. The key change is that *all* blocks in the output column contain the *same* 5x5 pattern.\n5.  **Pattern Selection**: The pattern used in the output grid seems to be one of the *unique* patterns from the input grid. In `train_1`, there were two patterns that appeared only once; the one chosen for the output was the one located in the top-right block (first unique pattern encountered when scanning top-to-bottom, left-to-right). In `train_2`, there were also two unique patterns; the one chosen for the output was again the first unique one encountered in reading order.\n6.  **Output Construction**: The output grid takes the selected unique 5x5 pattern, places it within the standard separator frame (using the input's separator color), and repeats this structure vertically the same number of times as the input grid had rows of blocks. The output width is fixed to the width of one block plus its two vertical separator lines (5 + 2 = 7 pixels). The output height matches the input height.\n\n**Facts**\n\n```"

Analyze the input grid to identify the separator color, the dimensions (H, W) of the internal patterns within blocks (e.g., 5x5), and the number of block rows (R) and columns (C).\n2.  Extract all HxW internal patterns from the R*C blocks in the input grid, keeping track of the original row and column index of each block.\n3.  Count the frequency of each distinct pattern identified in step 2.\n4.  Identify all patterns that occurred exactly once (the unique patterns).\n5.  From the set of unique patterns, select the one that came from the block with the lowest row index in the original input grid. If there's a tie in row index, select the one with the lowest column index among the tied rows. This is the \"target pattern\".\n6.  Create a new output grid with R*H + (R+1) rows and W+2 columns.\n7.  Fill the first column (index 0) and the last column (index W+1) of the output grid with the separator color.\n8.
