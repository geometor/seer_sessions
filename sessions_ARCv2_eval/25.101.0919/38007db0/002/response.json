            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation concept: identifying unique sub-patterns within a grid of blocks and using the top-leftmost unique pattern to construct a single-column output grid. However, the implementation failed because the function to determine the block dimensions (`find_grid_parameters`) contained a bug. It incorrectly assumed the first instance of the separator color along the top/left edge (after the corner) defined the block boundary, instead of searching for the first complete row/column composed solely of the separator color. This led to incorrect block dimensions (specifically `W=0` in the first example), causing a `ValueError` during the parameter validation, which triggered the fallback mechanism returning the original input grid.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the logic for finding the block height (H) and width (W) within the `find_grid_parameters` function. The rest of the logic (extracting patterns, counting frequencies, identifying the top-leftmost unique pattern, and constructing the output grid) appears sound based on the examples provided.\n\n**Metrics**\n"
