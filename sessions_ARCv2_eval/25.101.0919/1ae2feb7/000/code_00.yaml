elements:
  - item: grid
    properties:
      - 2D array of integers 0-9 (colors)
      - height and width vary
  - item: divider
    properties:
      - vertical line
      - single column
      - color: red (2)
      - separates grid into left and right sections
  - item: background
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
  - item: segments
    properties:
      - horizontal blocks of contiguous non-white pixels
      - located to the left of the divider
      - can have varying colors and lengths
      - can be adjacent to the divider or separated by white pixels
  - item: pattern
    properties:
      - sequence of colors
      - fills the area to the right of the divider in the output grid
      - generated per row
      - depends on colors and structure (segments) to the left of the divider in the same row
      - repeats horizontally to fill the right side

relationships:
  - The 'divider' determines the boundary for analysis (left) and modification (right).
  - The 'pattern' in a row on the right side is directly derived from the 'segments' and 'background' pixels in the same row on the left side.
  - The 'pattern' structure depends on:
      - Number of unique non-white colors on the left.
      - The color of the rightmost non-white pixel ('C_adj').
      - The length ('L') of the rightmost contiguous block of color 'C_adj'.
      - The presence and identity of other non-white colors ('c_o').

actions:
  - identify: the column index of the red 'divider'.
  - analyze: for each row, the section to the left of the 'divider'.
  - determine: the set of unique non-white colors ('C_all'), the rightmost non-white color ('C_adj'), and the length ('L') of its rightmost block.
  - generate: a repeating 'pattern' based on 'C_all', 'C_adj', 'L', and other colors ('c_o').
    - rule_1 (no colors): pattern is empty (effectively white).
    - rule_2 (one color): pattern is `[C_adj]` + `[0] * (L-1)`.
    - rule_3 (multiple colors, L=1): pattern is `[C_adj]`.
    - rule_4 (multiple colors, L>1): pattern is typically `[C_adj, c_o]`. (Requires refinement for exceptional cases like train_2 row 8).
  - fill: the section of the row to the right of the 'divider' by repeating the generated 'pattern'.
