            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the examples provided.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Divider**: Each grid features a single vertical line of red pixels (color 2). This line acts as a clear divider between the left and right sections of the grid. The position of this red line varies between examples (column 5 in train_1/2, column 3 in train_3).\n2.  **Left Side**: The area to the left of the red line contains the input information for the transformation. It consists of the background white (color 0) and horizontal segments of various colors (blue, magenta, azure, green, gray, yellow, orange). Some rows are entirely white on the left. Some rows contain segments of a single color, while others contain segments of multiple colors.\n3.  **Right Side Transformation**: The area to the right of the red line is initially white in the input and gets filled with patterns in the output. The pattern in each row on the right depends entirely on the content of the corresponding row to the left of the red line.\n4.  **Pattern Generation**:\n    *   If a row is empty (all white) to the left of the divider, it remains empty (all white) to the right.\n    *   If a row has colored pixels on the left, a repeating pattern is generated and tiled across the right side of that row.\n    *   The pattern seems primarily determined by the color of the rightmost non-white pixel on the left (`C_adj`) and the length (`L`) of the contiguous block of that color ending at that position.\n    *   The presence of other colors (`C_other`) in the same row to the left also influences the pattern.\n    *   **Single Color Case**: If only `C_adj` exists on the left, the pattern is `C_adj` followed by `L-1` white pixels (0), repeated. If `L=1`, the pattern is just `C_adj`.\n    *   **Multiple Color Case**: If other colors exist besides `C_adj`:\n        *   If `L=1`, the pattern is just `C_adj`, repeated.\n        *   If `L>1`, the pattern usually involves `C_adj` and the other color (`c_o`). The most common pattern observed is `[C_adj, c_o]`, repeated (length 2).\n        *   There is an exceptional case (train_2, row 8) where `L=2` and multiple colors exist (`C_adj=4`, `c_o=3`), but the pattern is more complex (`4 0 4 3 4 0 4 0 4 3...`) and doesn't simply repeat `[4, 3]`. This specific case requires a more nuanced rule, possibly related to the relative values of the colors or their counts/positions.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.\n3.  For each row (`r`) in the grid:\n    a.  Extract the portion of the row to the left of the divider: `left_part = input[r, 0 : div_col]`.\n    b.  Find all unique non-white colors present in `left_part`. Let this set be `C_all`.\n    c.  If `C_all` is empty, proceed to the next row.\n    d.  If `C_all` is not empty:\n        i.  Scan `left_part` from right to left to find the first (rightmost) non-white pixel. Record its color as `C_adj`.\n        ii. Scan further left from this position to find the length `L` of the contiguous block of color `C_adj`.\n        iii. Define the repeating base pattern `P`:\n            1.  If `C_all` contains only one color (`C_adj`): Set `P = [C_adj] + [0] * (L - 1)`. (If L=1, P is just `[C_adj]`).\n            2.  If `C_all` contains more than one color:\n                A.  If `L == 1`: Set `P = [C_adj]`.\n                B.  If `L > 1`: Identify the single other non-white color `c_o` present in `left_part`. Set `P = [C_adj, c_o]`. **(Note: This rule needs refinement to handle the specific pattern observed in train_2, row 8, which might depend on other factors like color values or counts).**\n        iv. Starting from column `div_col + 1` in the output grid's row `r`, fill the remaining columns by cyclically repeating the elements from pattern `P`."
