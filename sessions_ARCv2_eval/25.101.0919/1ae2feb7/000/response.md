Okay, let's break down the task based on the examples provided.

## Perception

1.  **Divider**: Each grid features a single vertical line of red pixels (color 2). This line acts as a clear divider between the left and right sections of the grid. The position of this red line varies between examples (column 5 in train_1/2, column 3 in train_3).
2.  **Left Side**: The area to the left of the red line contains the input information for the transformation. It consists of the background white (color 0) and horizontal segments of various colors (blue, magenta, azure, green, gray, yellow, orange). Some rows are entirely white on the left. Some rows contain segments of a single color, while others contain segments of multiple colors.
3.  **Right Side Transformation**: The area to the right of the red line is initially white in the input and gets filled with patterns in the output. The pattern in each row on the right depends entirely on the content of the corresponding row to the left of the red line.
4.  **Pattern Generation**:
    *   If a row is empty (all white) to the left of the divider, it remains empty (all white) to the right.
    *   If a row has colored pixels on the left, a repeating pattern is generated and tiled across the right side of that row.
    *   The pattern seems primarily determined by the color of the rightmost non-white pixel on the left (`C_adj`) and the length (`L`) of the contiguous block of that color ending at that position.
    *   The presence of other colors (`C_other`) in the same row to the left also influences the pattern.
    *   **Single Color Case**: If only `C_adj` exists on the left, the pattern is `C_adj` followed by `L-1` white pixels (0), repeated. If `L=1`, the pattern is just `C_adj`.
    *   **Multiple Color Case**: If other colors exist besides `C_adj`:
        *   If `L=1`, the pattern is just `C_adj`, repeated.
        *   If `L>1`, the pattern usually involves `C_adj` and the other color (`c_o`). The most common pattern observed is `[C_adj, c_o]`, repeated (length 2).
        *   There is an exceptional case (train_2, row 8) where `L=2` and multiple colors exist (`C_adj=4`, `c_o=3`), but the pattern is more complex (`4 0 4 3 4 0 4 0 4 3...`) and doesn't simply repeat `[4, 3]`. This specific case requires a more nuanced rule, possibly related to the relative values of the colors or their counts/positions.

## Facts


```yaml
elements:
  - item: grid
    properties:
      - 2D array of integers 0-9 (colors)
      - height and width vary
  - item: divider
    properties:
      - vertical line
      - single column
      - color: red (2)
      - separates grid into left and right sections
  - item: background
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
  - item: segments
    properties:
      - horizontal blocks of contiguous non-white pixels
      - located to the left of the divider
      - can have varying colors and lengths
      - can be adjacent to the divider or separated by white pixels
  - item: pattern
    properties:
      - sequence of colors
      - fills the area to the right of the divider in the output grid
      - generated per row
      - depends on colors and structure (segments) to the left of the divider in the same row
      - repeats horizontally to fill the right side

relationships:
  - The 'divider' determines the boundary for analysis (left) and modification (right).
  - The 'pattern' in a row on the right side is directly derived from the 'segments' and 'background' pixels in the same row on the left side.
  - The 'pattern' structure depends on:
      - Number of unique non-white colors on the left.
      - The color of the rightmost non-white pixel ('C_adj').
      - The length ('L') of the rightmost contiguous block of color 'C_adj'.
      - The presence and identity of other non-white colors ('c_o').

actions:
  - identify: the column index of the red 'divider'.
  - analyze: for each row, the section to the left of the 'divider'.
  - determine: the set of unique non-white colors ('C_all'), the rightmost non-white color ('C_adj'), and the length ('L') of its rightmost block.
  - generate: a repeating 'pattern' based on 'C_all', 'C_adj', 'L', and other colors ('c_o').
    - rule_1 (no colors): pattern is empty (effectively white).
    - rule_2 (one color): pattern is `[C_adj]` + `[0] * (L-1)`.
    - rule_3 (multiple colors, L=1): pattern is `[C_adj]`.
    - rule_4 (multiple colors, L>1): pattern is typically `[C_adj, c_o]`. (Requires refinement for exceptional cases like train_2 row 8).
  - fill: the section of the row to the right of the 'divider' by repeating the generated 'pattern'.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Locate the vertical red (2) line in the input grid; note its column index (`div_col`).
2.  Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.
3.  For each row (`r`) in the grid:
    a.  Extract the portion of the row to the left of the divider: `left_part = input[r, 0 : div_col]`.
    b.  Find all unique non-white colors present in `left_part`. Let this set be `C_all`.
    c.  If `C_all` is empty, proceed to the next row.
    d.  If `C_all` is not empty:
        i.  Scan `left_part` from right to left to find the first (rightmost) non-white pixel. Record its color as `C_adj`.
        ii. Scan further left from this position to find the length `L` of the contiguous block of color `C_adj`.
        iii. Define the repeating base pattern `P`:
            1.  If `C_all` contains only one color (`C_adj`): Set `P = [C_adj] + [0] * (L - 1)`. (If L=1, P is just `[C_adj]`).
            2.  If `C_all` contains more than one color:
                A.  If `L == 1`: Set `P = [C_adj]`.
                B.  If `L > 1`: Identify the single other non-white color `c_o` present in `left_part`. Set `P = [C_adj, c_o]`. **(Note: This rule needs refinement to handle the specific pattern observed in train_2, row 8, which might depend on other factors like color values or counts).**
        iv. Starting from column `div_col + 1` in the output grid's row `r`, fill the remaining columns by cyclically repeating the elements from pattern `P`.
