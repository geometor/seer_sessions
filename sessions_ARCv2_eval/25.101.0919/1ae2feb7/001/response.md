Transformation Rule:

1. Identify a vertical line of a single color (red, color 2) that acts as a divider between the left and right sections of the grid.
2. For each row, analyze the content to the left of the divider.
3. Based on the colors and their arrangement on the left side of a row, generate a repeating pattern.
4. Fill the portion of the row to the right of the divider by repeating this generated pattern.

Pattern Generation Logic:

a. If a row contains no non-white (0) pixels to the left of the divider, the right side remains white (0).
b. If a row contains non-white pixels to the left:
    i. Identify the color of the rightmost non-white pixel adjacent to (or nearest to) the divider (`C_adj`).
    ii. Determine the length (`L`) of the contiguous horizontal block of `C_adj` ending at this rightmost position.
    iii. Identify all unique non-white colors present in the row to the left of the divider (`C_all`).
    iv. Define the base repeating pattern `P`:
        - If `C_all` contains only one color (`C_adj`): 
            The pattern `P` consists of `C_adj` followed by `L-1` white (0) pixels. If `L` is 1, the pattern is just `[C_adj]`.
        - If `C_all` contains more than one color:
            - If `L` is 1: The pattern `P` is just `[C_adj]`.
            - If `L` is greater than 1: Identify the other non-white color `c_o` present in the row's left section. The pattern `P` is `[C_adj, c_o]`. (This assumes only two distinct non-white colors exist when L > 1; handles observed cases except for train_2, row 8 which might follow a more complex or specific rule not fully captured here).
c. Tile the generated pattern `P` across the columns to the right of the divider in the corresponding output row.
