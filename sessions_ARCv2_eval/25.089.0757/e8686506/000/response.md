Azure (8) is overwhelmingly the most frequent (144/169). It's the background.

- train_2: Input is 13x13 = 169 cells.

``` python
import numpy as np

input_grid_2 = np.array([
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],
[3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3],

Green (3) is overwhelmingly the most frequent (129/169). It's the background.

The background assumption holds. The issue is in the transformation process.

What if the output *only* includes the non-background pixels, arranged tightly?
Let's list non-background pixels for train_1 with coordinates:
(1, 5, 4)
(3, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 5, 3), (3, 6, 3), (3, 9, 4)
(4, 2, 3), (4, 6, 3)
(5, 2, 3), (5, 6, 3)
(6, 3, 3), (6, 5, 3), (6, 11, 4)
(7, 2, 3), (7, 3, 3), (7, 5, 3), (7, 6, 3)
(10, 2, 1), (10, 3, 1), (10, 4, 1), (10, 8, 6)
(11, 2, 1), (11, 3, 1), (11, 4, 1), (11, 8, 6)

Total non-background pixels = 1 + 5 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 25 pixels.
The output grid is 5x5 = 25 pixels. This is promising!

The transformation seems to be:
1. Identify the background color (most frequent).
2. Find all non-background pixels.
3. Determine the bounding box of these non-background pixels.
4. Create a new grid containing only the non-background pixels from the bounding box area, preserving their relative row/column order but collapsing the rows/columns that *only* contained background pixels *within the bounding box*.

Let's re-trace the "Filter Rows/Cols" steps, carefully tracking coordinates and the resulting grid construction.

**Re-run Revised Hypothesis (Filter Rows/Cols) on train_1 - DETAILED:**
1. Background: 8
2. Bounding Box: Rows 1-11, Cols 2-11. Origin (top-left) of BB is (1, 2).
3. Subgrid (content within bounding box, 11 rows x 10 cols):
   
```
   8 8 8 4 8 8 8 8 8 8   (Input Row 1)
   8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8   (Input Row 2)
   3 3 8 3 3 8 8 4 8 8   (Input Row 3)
   3 8 8 8 3 8 8 8 8 8   (Input Row 4)
   3 8 8 8 3 8 8 8 8 8   (Input Row 5)
   8 3 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 4   (Input Row 6)
   3 3 8 3 3 8 8 8 8 8   (Input Row 7)
   8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8   (Input Row 8)
   8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8   (Input Row 9)
   1 1 1 8 8 8 6 8 8 8   (Input Row 10)
   1 1 1 8 8 8 6 8 8 8   (Input Row 11)
   ```

4. Identify rows within the subgrid containing *only* background (8):
   - Subgrid Row Index 1 (Input Row 2)
   - Subgrid Row Index 7 (Input Row 8)
   - Subgrid Row Index 8 (Input Row 9)
   Keep Subgrid Row Indices: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 (corresponds to Input Rows 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11)

5. Identify columns within the subgrid containing *only* background (8):
   (Check ALL rows of the subgrid, including those marked for removal, when assessing columns)
   - Subgrid Col Index 0 (Input Col 2): Has 3, 1. Keep.
   - Subgrid Col Index 1 (Input Col 3): Has 3, 1. Keep.
   - Subgrid Col Index 2 (Input Col 4): Has 1. Keep.
   - Subgrid Col Index 3 (Input Col 5): Has 4, 3. Keep.
   - Subgrid Col Index 4 (Input Col 6): Has 3. Keep.
   - Subgrid Col Index 5 (Input Col 7): All 8s. Remove.
   - Subgrid Col Index 6 (Input Col 8): Has 6. Keep.
   - Subgrid Col Index 7 (Input Col 9): Has 4. Keep.
   - Subgrid Col Index 8 (Input Col 10): All 8s. Remove.
   - Subgrid Col Index 9 (Input Col 11): Has 4. Keep.
   Keep Subgrid Col Indices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 (corresponds to Input Cols 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11)

6. Construct the output grid using the pixels from the *original subgrid* at the intersection of the *kept row indices* and *kept column indices*.
   - Kept Subgrid Row Indices: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10
   - Kept Subgrid Col Indices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9

   Output Grid (8x8):
   Row 0 from subgrid, kept cols: `8 8 8 4 8 8 4 4`
   Row 2 from subgrid, kept cols: `3 3 8 3 3 8 4 8`
   Row 3 from subgrid, kept cols: `3 8 8 8 3 8 8 8`
   Row 4 from subgrid, kept cols: `3 8 8 8 3 8 8 8`
   Row 5 from subgrid, kept cols: `8 3 8 3 8 8 8 4`
   Row 6 from subgrid, kept cols: `3 3 8 3 3 8 8 8`
   Row 9 from subgrid, kept cols: `1 1 1 8 8 6 8 8`
   Row 10 from subgrid, kept cols: `1 1 1 8 8 6 8 8`

This still gives 8x8, not 5x5. What crucial detail am I missing?

Maybe the output isn't pixels but *objects*?
No, the pixels align too well.

Could the definition of the bounding box be different? Maybe the bounding box of the *output* grid corresponds to something?

Let's re-examine the output for train_1:

```
3 3 4 3 3
3 1 1 1 3
3 1 1 1 3
4 3 6 3 4
3 3 6 3 3
```

It looks like a composition.
Top-left object: Green frame segment `[[3, 3], [3, 0], [3, 0]]` -> matches part of input green frame.
Middle object: Blue rectangle `[[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]]` -> matches input blue rectangle.
Center object: Magenta dots `[[6], [6]]` -> matches input magenta dots.
Yellow dots scattered: `4` at (0, 2), `4` at (3, 0), `4` at (3, 4). -> matches input yellow dots.
Other green parts fill the remaining space.

The relative positions are maintained.

Consider the non-background pixels again for train_1:
Rows with non-bg: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11
Cols with non-bg: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11

Map input rows -> output rows:
Input Row 1 -> Output Row ? (Contains Y1) -> Output Row 0 has Y1 at col 2.
Input Row 3 -> Output Row ? (Contains G, Y2) -> Output Row 0 has G, Y2.
Input Row 4 -> Output Row ? (Contains G) -> Output Row ?
Input Row 5 -> Output Row ? (Contains G) -> Output Row ?
Input Row 6 -> Output Row ? (Contains G, Y3) -> Output Row 3 has G, Y3.
Input Row 7 -> Output Row ? (Contains G) -> Output Row ?
Input Row 10 -> Output Row ? (Contains B, M) -> Output Rows 1, 2, 3, 4 have B or M.
Input Row 11 -> Output Row ? (Contains B, M) -> Output Rows 1, 2, 3, 4 have B or M.

Map input cols -> output cols:
Input Col 2 -> Output Col ? (Contains G, B) -> Output Col 0, 1.
Input Col 3 -> Output Col ? (Contains G, B) -> Output Col 0, 1, 3.
Input Col 4 -> Output Col ? (Contains B) -> Output Col 1, 2, 3.
Input Col 5 -> Output Col ? (Contains Y1, G) -> Output Col 2, 3.
Input Col 6 -> Output Col ? (Contains G) -> Output Col 3, 4.
Input Col 8 -> Output Col ? (Contains M) -> Output Col 2.
Input Col 9 -> Output Col ? (Contains Y2) -> Output Col ? (Maybe output col 2 or 0?) - Y2 is at (3,9), Output Y is at (0,2) and (3,0) and (3,4)
Input Col 11 -> Output Col ? (Contains Y3) -> Output Col 4.

Let's try mapping the *kept* rows/cols from the previous attempt:
Kept Input Rows: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11 (Indices 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 in subgrid)
Kept Input Cols: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11 (Indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 in subgrid)

If we take these kept rows/cols and assign sequential indices:
Output Row 0 <- Input Row 1
Output Row 1 <- Input Row 3
Output Row 2 <- Input Row 4
Output Row 3 <- Input Row 5
Output Row 4 <- Input Row 6
Output Row 5 <- Input Row 7
Output Row 6 <- Input Row 10
Output Row 7 <- Input Row 11

Output Col 0 <- Input Col 2
Output Col 1 <- Input Col 3
Output Col 2 <- Input Col 4
Output Col 3 <- Input Col 5
Output Col 4 <- Input Col 6
Output Col 5 <- Input Col 8
Output Col 6 <- Input Col 9
Output Col 7 <- Input Col 11

Now, create the 8x8 grid using the original input values at the mapped (Input Row, Input Col):

```
Grid[0,0] = Input[1, 2] = 8
Grid[0,1] = Input[1, 3] = 8
Grid[0,2] = Input[1, 4] = 8
Grid[0,3] = Input[1, 5] = 4  <- Y1
Grid[0,4] = Input[1, 6] = 8
Grid[0,5] = Input[1, 8] = 8
Grid[0,6] = Input[1, 9] = 8
Grid[0,7] = Input[1, 11]= 8

Grid[1,0] = Input[3, 2] = 3
Grid[1,1] = Input[3, 3] = 3
Grid[1,2] = Input[3, 4] = 8
Grid[1,3] = Input[3, 5] = 3
Grid[1,4] = Input[3, 6] = 3
Grid[1,5] = Input[3, 8] = 8
Grid[1,6] = Input[3, 9] = 4  <- Y2
Grid[1,7] = Input[3, 11]= 8

Grid[6,0] = Input[10, 2] = 1
Grid[6,1] = Input[10, 3] = 1
Grid[6,2] = Input[10, 4] = 1
Grid[6,3] = Input[10, 5] = 8
Grid[6,4] = Input[10, 6] = 8
Grid[6,5] = Input[10, 8] = 6  <- M1
Grid[6,6] = Input[10, 9] = 8
Grid[6,7] = Input[10, 11]= 8
```

This results in the exact same 8x8 grid as before. The method is sound, but the result doesn't match the 5x5 output.

What is different about the 5x5 output?

```
3 3 4 3 3
3 1 1 1 3
3 1 1 1 3
4 3 6 3 4
3 3 6 3 3
```

Let's compare it pixel-by-pixel to the non-background parts of the input subgrid:
Input subgrid (non-background only):

```
. . . 4 . . . . . .  (row 1)
. . . . . . . . . .  (row 2)
3 3 . 3 3 . . 4 . .  (row 3)
3 . . . 3 . . . . .  (row 4)
3 . . . 3 . . . . .  (row 5)
. 3 . 3 . . . . . 4  (row 6)
3 3 . 3 3 . . . . .  (row 7)
. . . . . . . . . .  (row 8)
. . . . . . . . . .  (row 9)
1 1 1 . . . 6 . . .  (row 10)
1 1 1 . . . 6 . . .  (row 11)
```

The shapes look similar but compressed.

Could the "empty" rows/columns be defined based on the *objects* rather than just pixels?
Objects:
- Y1: (1, 5)
- G1: BBox(3,2) to (7,6) (complex shape)
- Y2: (3, 9)
- Y3: (6, 11)
- B1: BBox(10,2) to (11,4)
- M1: BBox(10,8) to (11,8)

Bounding box of all objects: Rows 1-11, Cols 2-11.

Maybe the process is:
1. Find objects (contiguous non-background pixels).
2. Find the overall bounding box of all objects.
3. Crop the input to this bounding box.
4. Create a mapping from input row/col within the bounding box to output row/col by *skipping* input rows/cols that contain *no part of any object*. This seems identical to skipping rows/cols with only background pixels.

Let's reconsider the output construction. Maybe it's not a simple crop and filter.
Could it be related to the center of mass or some other property of the objects?

Look at train_2 output (8x5):

```
5 1 1 1 5
1 8 8 8 1
1 1 8 1 1
6 1 8 1 6
6 2 4 2 6
2 2 4 2 2
2 4 4 4 2
5 2 2 2 5
```

Input non-background pixels (Background=3):
Rows: 1-12
Cols: 1-11
Bounding Box: Rows 1-12, Cols 1-11. Subgrid is 12x11.
Filter rows containing only 3: None.
Filter cols containing only 3: None.
The previous method would yield the 12x11 subgrid. The actual output is 8x5.

This task seems significantly different from simple crop/filter.

**New Hypothesis: Object Superposition with Minimal Grid**
1.  Identify the background color (most frequent).
2.  Identify all distinct objects (contiguous non-background pixels).
3.  For each object, determine its shape relative to its own top-left corner.
4.  Determine the relative positions of the top-left corners of all objects based on the overall bounding box of *all* objects.
5.  Create a new minimal grid. Place the objects onto this grid according to their relative positions, potentially allowing overlap (need rules for overlap resolution) or shifting them to be as close as possible while preserving relative order.

Let's try this on train_1:
1. Background: 8
2. Objects (relative shapes & input top-left):
   - Y1: `[[4]]` @ (1, 5)
   - G1: `[[3, 3, 0, 3, 3], [3, 0, 0, 0, 3], [3, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [3, 3, 0, 3, 3]]` (using 0 for transparency) @ (3, 2)
   - Y2: `[[4]]` @ (3, 9)
   - Y3: `[[4]]` @ (6, 11)
   - B1: `[[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]]` @ (10, 2)
   - M1: `[[6], [6]]` @ (10, 8)
3. Overall Bounding Box: (1, 2) to (11, 11). Origin = (1, 2).
4. Relative Top-Left positions (relative to BB origin (1,2)):
   - Y1: (1-1, 5-2) = (0, 3)
   - G1: (3-1, 2-2) = (2, 0)
   - Y2: (3-1, 9-2) = (2, 7)
   - Y3: (6-1, 11-2) = (5, 9)
   - B1: (10-1, 2-2) = (9, 0)
   - M1: (10-1, 8-2) = (9, 6)
5. Create minimal grid and place objects:
   The relative coordinates span rows 0-10 (from B1/M1 at row 9 + height 2) and cols 0-10 (from Y3 at col 9 + width 1). Size = 11x11.
   Place objects onto an 11x11 grid based on these relative coordinates.
   - Y1 at (0, 3)
   - G1 at (2, 0)
   - Y2 at (2, 7)
   - Y3 at (5, 9)
   - B1 at (9, 0)
   - M1 at (9, 6)

   Grid (using '.' for empty/background):
   
```
   . . . 4 . . . . . . .  (row 0)
   . . . . . . . . . . .  (row 1)
   3 3 . 3 3 . . 4 . . .  (row 2) G1 row 0, Y2
   3 . . . 3 . . . . . .  (row 3) G1 row 1
   3 . . . 3 . . . . . .  (row 4) G1 row 2
   . 3 . 3 . . . . . 4 .  (row 5) G1 row 3, Y3
   3 3 . 3 3 . . . . . .  (row 6) G1 row 4
   . . . . . . . . . . .  (row 7)
   . . . . . . . . . . .  (row 8)
   1 1 1 . . . 6 . . . .  (row 9) B1 row 0, M1 row 0
   1 1 1 . . . 6 . . . .  (row 10) B1 row 1, M1 row 1
   ```

   This looks exactly like the non-background pixels within the bounding box from before. This approach leads back to the same problem. The output is 5x5, not 11x11 or 8x8.

**Final Idea: Focus on the Output Structure**
The output grid (5x5 for train_1, 8x5 for train_2) must be constructed based on some property of the input.
Could it be the bounding box of a *specific* object? Or the intersection/union of objects?

Look at the colors in train_1 output: 3, 4, 1, 6. All non-background input colors.
Look at the colors in train_2 output: 5, 1, 8, 6, 2, 4. All non-background input colors.

It seems all non-background content is preserved. The compression is the key.

What if the rows/columns removed are not just those with *only* background, but those that *don't contribute to the structure*? This is vague.

Let's reconsider the "filter empty rows/columns" approach one last time.
Input -> Bounding Box -> Subgrid -> Filter empty rows -> Filter empty columns.

Maybe the order matters? Filter columns first, then rows?
**Re-run Revised Hypothesis (Filter Cols then Rows) on train_1:**
1. Background: 8
2. Bounding Box: Rows 1-11, Cols 2-11.
3. Subgrid (11x10): (same as before)
4. Filter Columns containing ONLY background (8) from the subgrid:
   - Keep Cols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 (Indices relative to subgrid)
   - Remove Cols: 5, 8
   Intermediate Grid (Cols removed): (11 rows x 8 cols)
   
```
   8 8 8 4 8 8 4 4   (subgrid row 0)
   8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8   (subgrid row 1)
   3 3 8 3 3 8 4 8   (subgrid row 2)
   3 8 8 8 3 8 8 8   (subgrid row 3)
   3 8 8 8 3 8 8 8   (subgrid row 4)
   8 3 8 3 8 8 8 4   (subgrid row 5)
   3 3 8 3 3 8 8 8   (subgrid row 6)
   8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8   (subgrid row 7)
   8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8   (subgrid row 8)
   1 1 1 8 8 6 8 8   (subgrid row 9)
   1 1 1 8 8 6 8 8   (subgrid row 10)
   ```

5. Filter Rows containing ONLY background (8) from this *intermediate* grid:
   - Row 1: All 8s. Remove.
   - Row 7: All 8s. Remove.
   - Row 8: All 8s. Remove.
   Final Grid (Rows removed): (8 rows x 8 cols)
   
```
   8 8 8 4 8 8 4 4   (subgrid row 0)
   3 3 8 3 3 8 4 8   (subgrid row 2)
   3 8 8 8 3 8 8 8   (subgrid row 3)
   3 8 8 8 3 8 8 8   (subgrid row 4)
   8 3 8 3 8 8 8 4   (subgrid row 5)
   3 3 8 3 3 8 8 8   (subgrid row 6)
   1 1 1 8 8 6 8 8   (subgrid row 9)
   1 1 1 8 8 6 8 8   (subgrid row 10)
   ```

This yields the same 8x8 grid. Order doesn't matter. The logic is flawed somewhere.

Could the background color definition be wrong? No, it's clearly the dominant color.
Could the bounding box be wrong? No, it seems correct (min/max row/col of non-background pixels).

What if the output grid *pixels* are directly sampled from the input grid, but only the non-background ones, and then arranged?
Input non-background pixels (train_1): 25 total. Output is 5x5 = 25.
Input non-background pixels (train_2): 1+11+11+5+4+4+5 = 41 pixels (summing counts from np.unique). Output is 8x5 = 40 pixels. Close, but not exact for train_2. Let me recount non-3 pixels for train_2.
11(1) + 11(2) + 5(4) + 4(5) + 4(6) + 5(8) = 40 pixels. OK, the count matches (8x5=40).

So, the output grid consists *exactly* of the non-background pixels from the input, preserving their relative order. The transformation compacts the space by removing background-only rows/columns within the bounding box.

Why did my simulation produce an 8x8 grid for train_1? Let's re-examine the output and the simulation result.
Target Output (5x5):

```
3 3 4 3 3
3 1 1 1 3
3 1 1 1 3
4 3 6 3 4
3 3 6 3 3
```

My Simulation Output (8x8):

```
8 8 8 4 8 8 4 4  <- Contains bg '8'
3 3 8 3 3 8 4 8  <- Contains bg '8'
3 8 8 8 3 8 8 8  <- Contains bg '8'
3 8 8 8 3 8 8 8  <- Contains bg '8'
8 3 8 3 8 8 8 4  <- Contains bg '8'
3 3 8 3 3 8 8 8  <- Contains bg '8'
1 1 1 8 8 6 8 8  <- Contains bg '8'
1 1 1 8 8 6 8 8  <- Contains bg '8'
```

My simulation result *still contains background pixels*. The target output contains *only* the non-background colors.

**Corrected Hypothesis:**
1.  Identify the background color (most frequent).
2.  Find the coordinates of all non-background pixels.
3.  Determine the minimum bounding box containing all non-background pixels.
4.  Create a list of rows within the bounding box that contain at least one non-background pixel. Let this be `kept_rows_indices`.
5.  Create a list of columns within the bounding box that contain at least one non-background pixel. Let this be `kept_cols_indices`.
6.  The dimensions of the output grid will be `len(kept_rows_indices)` x `len(kept_cols_indices)`.
7.  Create the output grid. For each cell `(r_out, c_out)` in the output grid, its value is taken from the input grid at `(kept_rows_indices[r_out], kept_cols_indices[c_out])`.

**Testing Corrected Hypothesis on train_1:**
1. Background: 8
2. Non-background pixels identified.
3. Bounding Box: Input Rows 1-11, Input Cols 2-11.
4. Rows in BB with non-bg pixels: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11. `kept_rows_indices = [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11]` (Length 8)
5. Cols in BB with non-bg pixels: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11. `kept_cols_indices = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11]` (Length 8)
6. Output dimensions: 8 x 8.
7. Create 8x8 grid:
   Output[0, 0] = Input[kept_rows[0], kept_cols[0]] = Input[1, 2] = 8
   Output[0, 1] = Input[kept_rows[0], kept_cols[1]] = Input[1, 3] = 8
   Output[0, 2] = Input[kept_rows[0], kept_cols[2]] = Input[1, 4] = 8
   Output[0, 3] = Input[kept_rows[0], kept_cols[3]] = Input[1, 5] = 4
   ...
   Output[1, 0] = Input[kept_rows[1], kept_cols[0]] = Input[3, 2] = 3
   Output[1, 1] = Input[kept_rows[1], kept_cols[1]] = Input[3, 3] = 3
   Output[1, 2] = Input[kept_rows[1], kept_cols[2]] = Input[3, 4] = 8
   Output[1, 3] = Input[kept_rows[1], kept_cols[3]] = Input[3, 5] = 3
   ...
This produces the exact same 8x8 grid as before, which includes background pixels and doesn't match the 5x5 target.

I must be fundamentally misunderstanding the compression/filtering.

What if the output grid is formed by taking *only* the non-background pixels and arranging them?
Train_1 non-background pixels (row, col, color):
[(1, 5, 4), (3, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 5, 3), (3, 6, 3), (3, 9, 4), (4, 2, 3), (4, 6, 3), (5, 2, 3), (5, 6, 3), (6, 3, 3), (6, 5, 3), (6, 11, 4), (7, 2, 3), (7, 3, 3), (7, 5, 3), (7, 6, 3), (10, 2, 1), (10, 3, 1), (10, 4, 1), (10, 8, 6), (11, 2, 1), (11, 3, 1), (11, 4, 1), (11, 8, 6)] - 25 pixels

Output grid (5x5):

```
3 3 4 3 3
3 1 1 1 3
3 1 1 1 3
4 3 6 3 4
3 3 6 3 3
```

How are the 25 input pixels mapped to the 25 output cells?
Map relative coordinates.
Min Row = 1, Min Col = 2.
Relative Coords (row-1, col-2):
[(0, 3, 4), (2, 0, 3), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 3), (2, 4, 3), (2, 7, 4), (3, 0, 3), (3, 4, 3), (4, 0, 3), (4, 4, 3), (5, 1, 3), (5, 3, 3), (5, 9, 4), (6, 0, 3), (6, 1, 3), (6, 3, 3), (6, 4, 3), (9, 0, 1), (9, 1, 1), (9, 2, 1), (9, 6, 6), (10, 0, 1), (10, 1, 1), (10, 2, 1), (10, 6, 6)]

Unique Relative Rows: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 (8 unique rows) -> Map to output rows 0..7? No, output has 5 rows.
Unique Relative Cols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 (8 unique cols) -> Map to output cols
