## Perception of Task Elements

The input consists of two lines, each containing a sequence of identical numbers separated by spaces. Let's call the number in the first line `num1` and the number in the second line `num2`. Both sequences have the same length.

The output also consists of two lines. These lines are formed by interleaving `num1` and `num2`.
- The first output line starts with `num1` and alternates with `num2`.
- The second output line starts with `num2` and alternates with `num1`.
- The length of the output sequences is the same as the length of the input sequences.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Read the two input lines as strings.
2.  Extract the unique number from the first input line (`num1`) and the unique number from the second input line (`num2`).
3.  Determine the length (`L`) of the sequences in the input lines (count the numbers in one line).
4.  Generate the first output line: Create a sequence of length `L` by alternating `num1` and `num2`, starting with `num1`. Format this sequence as a space-separated string.
5.  Generate the second output line: Create a sequence of length `L` by alternating `num2` and `num1`, starting with `num2`. Format this sequence as a space-separated string.
6.  Output the two generated lines.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: Execution Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'

## Example 2:
Error: Execution Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
## General Assessment

The primary issue is an input type mismatch. The previous `transform` function was designed to accept a `list[str]`, where each string contained space-separated numbers. However, the execution environment passed a `numpy.ndarray` to the function, causing the `AttributeError` when the `.split()` method (valid for strings) was called on the array object.

The strategy is to revise the understanding of the input and output formats. The input should be treated as a 2D NumPy array (a grid or matrix). The transformation logic remains the same (interleaving elements), but the implementation must operate on array elements directly rather than parsing strings. The output format should also be revised, likely to a 2D NumPy array matching the structure of the desired output pattern.

## Metrics

## Natural Language Program (Revised)

1.  Receive the input as a 2D NumPy array, `input_grid`.
2.  Extract the number from the first row (`num1`) using `input_grid[0, 0]`.
3.  Extract the number from the second row (`num2`) using `input_grid[1, 0]`.
4.  Determine the number of columns (`num_cols`) from the shape of the `input_grid` using `input_grid.shape[1]`.
5.  Create an empty NumPy array, `output_grid`, with the same shape and data type as `input_grid`.
6.  Populate the first row of `output_grid`: For each column index `j` from 0 to `num_cols - 1`:
    *   If `j` is even, set `output_grid[0, j]` to `num1`.
    *   If `j` is odd, set `output_grid[0, j]` to `num2`.
7.  Populate the second row of `output_grid`: For each column index `j` from 0 to `num_cols - 1`:
    *   If `j` is even, set `output_grid[1, j]` to `num2`.
    *   If `j` is odd, set `output_grid[1, j]` to `num1`.
8.  Return the `output_grid`.
