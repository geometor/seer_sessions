## Perception of Task Elements

The input consists of two lines, each containing a sequence of identical numbers separated by spaces. Let's call the number in the first line `num1` and the number in the second line `num2`. Both sequences have the same length.

The output also consists of two lines. These lines are formed by interleaving `num1` and `num2`.
- The first output line starts with `num1` and alternates with `num2`.
- The second output line starts with `num2` and alternates with `num1`.
- The length of the output sequences is the same as the length of the input sequences.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Read the two input lines as strings.
2.  Extract the unique number from the first input line (`num1`) and the unique number from the second input line (`num2`).
3.  Determine the length (`L`) of the sequences in the input lines (count the numbers in one line).
4.  Generate the first output line: Create a sequence of length `L` by alternating `num1` and `num2`, starting with `num1`. Format this sequence as a space-separated string.
5.  Generate the second output line: Create a sequence of length `L` by alternating `num2` and `num1`, starting with `num2`. Format this sequence as a space-separated string.
6.  Output the two generated lines.
