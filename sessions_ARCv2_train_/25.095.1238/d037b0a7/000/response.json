The transformation modifies the grid based on the values and positions of the non-zero elements. Zeros ('0') appear to be placeholder values that can be replaced. Non-zero numbers seem to propagate downwards within their respective columns.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

If the input cell value is non-zero, update `last_non_zero_value` to this value.\n7.  If the input cell value is zero *and* `last_non_zero_value` is non-zero, set the value of the corresponding cell `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to `last_non_zero_value`.\n8.  If the input cell value is non-zero, ensure the corresponding cell `(r, c)` in the *output* grid also holds this non-zero value (it should already from the initial copy, but this clarifies the logic).\n9.
