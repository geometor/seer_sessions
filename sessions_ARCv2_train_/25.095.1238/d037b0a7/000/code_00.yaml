task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  - type: 2D array of integers
  - size: constant (3x3 in examples)
  - cell_values: integers (0-9 observed)
objects:
  - name: grid_cell
    properties:
      - value: integer
      - row_index: integer
      - column_index: integer
      - is_zero: boolean
  - name: grid_column
    properties:
      - index: integer
      - cells: ordered list of grid_cells
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Cells are arranged in rows and columns.
  - type: vertical_dependency
    description: The value of a cell can be determined by the value of the cell(s) above it in the same column.
actions:
  - name: propagate_downward
    actor: non-zero_cell_value
    target: zero_cell_value
    condition: The zero cell is below the non-zero cell within the same column.
    effect: The zero cell's value is replaced by the most recent non-zero value encountered above it in that column.
transformation_focus: column-based processing
goal: Fill vertical gaps (zeros) below non-zero numbers within each column.
