task_description: Generate two output sequences by alternating elements from two input sequences.
input_structure:
  type: text
  lines: 2
  elements_per_line: multiple, space-separated
  element_type: integer
  line_1_property: Contains repetitions of a single number (num1).
  line_2_property: Contains repetitions of a different single number (num2).
  shared_property: Both lines have the same number of elements (length).
output_structure:
  type: text
  lines: 2
  elements_per_line: multiple, space-separated, same length as input
  element_type: integer
transformation:
  line_1_output:
    pattern: Alternating sequence of num1 and num2.
    start_element: num1
    length: Matches input length.
  line_2_output:
    pattern: Alternating sequence of num2 and num1.
    start_element: num2
    length: Matches input length.
relationships:
  - Output elements are derived solely from the two unique numbers in the input.
  - Output sequence length is determined by input sequence length.
  - The starting element of each output line corresponds to the number on the respective input line.
