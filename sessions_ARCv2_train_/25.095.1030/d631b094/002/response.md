*   **Assessment:** The previous code failed because it assumed the `transform` function would receive a raw string representation of the grid and attempted to parse it using `parse_input`. However, the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` indicates that the `transform` function was actually called with an already parsed `numpy.ndarray` object. The core logic of iterating through the grid and collecting non-zero elements appears correct based on the input/output examples. The strategy is to modify the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array directly, removing the redundant parsing step.

*   **Metrics:**
    The core transformation logic (extracting non-zero elements in row-major order) holds true for all examples:
    *   **train_1:** Input grid has one non-zero element (7). Output is "7".
    *   **train_2:** Input grid has three non-zero elements (2, 2, 2). Output is "2 2 2".
    *   **train_3:** Input grid has four non-zero elements (8, 8, 8, 8). Output is "8 8 8 8".
    *   **train_4:** Input grid has two non-zero elements (1, 1). Output is "1 1".
    The error occurred before this logic could be executed due to the incorrect assumption about the input type passed to the `transform` function.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - name: input_grid
        type: numpy.ndarray (3x3) of integers
        properties:
          - cells: contains integer values (0 or non-zero)
          - dimensions: 3 rows, 3 columns
      - name: output_sequence
        type: string
        properties:
          - content: space-separated integers derived from the input_grid
          - format: integers are ordered based on row-major traversal of the input_grid
    actions:
      - name: filter_and_format
        input: input_grid (numpy.ndarray)
        output: output_sequence (string)
        steps:
          - Initialize an empty list to store non-zero numbers.
          - Iterate through the input_grid rows from top to bottom (index 0 to 2).
          - Within each row, iterate through columns from left to right (index 0 to 2).
          - If the value in the current cell is not equal to 0, append it to the list.
          - Convert each number in the list to its string representation.
          - Join the string representations using a single space as a separator.
        post_conditions:
          - The output_sequence contains string representations of all non-zero integers from the input_grid.
          - The order of integers in output_sequence matches the row-major traversal order of the input_grid.
          - If no non-zero numbers are found, the output_sequence is an empty string.
    relationships:
      - The numbers represented in the output_sequence are exactly the non-zero numbers present in the input_grid.
      - The count of numbers in the output_sequence equals the count of non-zero cells in the input_grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept a 3x3 NumPy array named `input_grid` as input.
    2.  Initialize an empty list called `non_zero_numbers`.
    3.  Iterate through each row of the `input_grid`, from row index 0 to 2.
    4.  Within each row, iterate through each column, from column index 0 to 2.
    5.  Get the integer value from the cell at the current row and column index.
    6.  If the integer value is not equal to 0, append this value to the `non_zero_numbers` list.
    7.  After iterating through all cells, create a new list by converting each integer in `non_zero_numbers` into its string representation.
    8.  Join the elements of the new list of strings using a single space (" ") as the separator.
    9.  Return the resulting joined string.
