*   **Perception:** The input is consistently a 3x3 grid containing single-digit integers. The output is a sequence of single-digit integers separated by spaces. The core transformation appears to involve filtering the input grid: only the non-zero numbers from the input grid are present in the output sequence. The order of the numbers in the output sequence corresponds to a standard reading order of the grid (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - name: input_grid
        type: 2D array (3x3) of integers
        properties:
          - cells: contains integer values (0 or non-zero)
          - dimensions: 3 rows, 3 columns
      - name: output_sequence
        type: 1D sequence of integers
        properties:
          - elements: integers derived from the input_grid
    actions:
      - name: filter_and_collect
        input: input_grid
        output: output_sequence
        steps:
          - Iterate through the input_grid cells row by row, from top to bottom.
          - Within each row, iterate from left to right.
          - For each cell, check if its value is non-zero.
          - If the value is non-zero, append it to a temporary list.
        post_conditions:
          - The output_sequence contains all non-zero integers from the input_grid.
          - The order of integers in output_sequence matches the row-by-row, left-to-right traversal order of the input_grid.
    relationships:
      - The elements of the output_sequence are a subset of the elements in the input_grid, specifically the non-zero elements.
      - The quantity of elements in the output_sequence is equal to the count of non-zero elements in the input_grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an empty list to store the output numbers.
    2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, starting from the top row (row 0) and proceeding to the bottom row (row 2).
    3.  Within each row, iterate through each cell, starting from the leftmost column (column 0) and proceeding to the rightmost column (column 2).
    4.  For the current cell, check if the integer value it contains is not equal to 0.
    5.  If the value is not 0, append this value to the list initialized in step 1.
    6.  After iterating through all cells in the grid, join the numbers collected in the list into a single string, with each number separated by a single space.
    7.  Output the resulting string.

*   **Assessment:** The previous code failed because it assumed the `transform` function would receive a raw string representation of the grid and attempted to parse it using `parse_input`. However, the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` indicates that the `transform` function was actually called with an already parsed `numpy.ndarray` object. The core logic of iterating through the grid and collecting non-zero elements appears correct based on the input/output examples. The strategy is to modify the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array directly, removing the redundant parsing step.

*   **Metrics:**
    The core transformation logic (extracting non-zero elements in row-major order) holds true for all examples:
    *   **train_1:** Input grid has one non-zero element (7). Output is "7".
    *   **train_2:** Input grid has three non-zero elements (2, 2, 2). Output is "2 2 2".
    *   **train_3:** Input grid has four non-zero elements (8, 8, 8, 8). Output is "8 8 8 8".
    *   **train_4:** Input grid has two non-zero elements (1, 1). Output is "1 1".
    The error occurred before this logic could be executed due to the incorrect assumption about the input type passed to the `transform` function.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept a 3x3 NumPy array named `input_grid` as input.
    2.  Initialize an empty list called `non_zero_numbers`.
    3.  Iterate through each row of the `input_grid`, from row index 0 to 2.
    4.  Within each row, iterate through each column, from column index 0 to 2.
    5.  Get the integer value from the cell at the current row and column index.
    6.  If the integer value is not equal to 0, append this value to the `non_zero_numbers` list.
    7.  After iterating through all cells, create a new list by converting each integer in `non_zero_numbers` into its string representation.
    8.  Join the elements of the new list of strings using a single space (" ") as the separator.
    9.  Return the resulting joined string.
