```python

"""
Transforms a 1D NumPy array by swapping adjacent pairs of elements.
It iterates through the array with a step of 2. For each pair of elements
at indices `i` and `i+1`, it swaps their positions. If the array has an
odd number of elements, the last element remains in its position relative
to the swapped pairs.
