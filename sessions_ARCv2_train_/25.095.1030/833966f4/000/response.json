Each line contains a single number (specifically, single digits in the examples).\n2.  **Data Structure:** The core data can be interpreted as an ordered list of numbers.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation rearranges the order of the numbers in the list. Observing the examples:\n    *   In `train_1`: `[9, 0, 1, 6, 8]` becomes `[0, 9, 1, 8, 6]`. The first pair `(9, 0)` is swapped to `(0, 9)`. The middle element `1` remains unchanged. The last pair `(6, 8)` is swapped to `(8, 6)`.\n    *   In `train_2`: `[4, 3, 6, 2, 8]` becomes `[3, 4, 6, 8, 2]`. The first pair `(4, 3)` is swapped to `(3, 4)`. The element `6` remains unchanged (wait, this contradicts the first example's pattern). Let's re-evaluate.\n    *   Revisiting `train_1`: `[9, 0, 1, 6, 8]` -> `[0, 9, 1, 8, 6]`. Swap `(9, 0)`, swap `(6, 8)`.\n    *   Revisiting `train_2`: `[4, 3, 6, 2, 8]` -> `[3, 4, 6, 8, 2]`. Swap `(4, 3)`, swap `(2, 8)`.\n    *   It appears the rule is to iterate through the list taking adjacent elements as pairs (indices 0 and 1, indices 2 and 3, etc.) and swap the elements within each pair. If there's a final element without a partner (due to an odd list length), it remains in its position relative to the swapped pairs.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
