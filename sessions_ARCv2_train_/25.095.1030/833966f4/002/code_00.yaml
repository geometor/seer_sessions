objects:
  - name: input_array
    type: numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - 1-dimensional
      - contains numerical elements (integers in examples)
  - name: output_array
    type: numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - 1-dimensional
      - contains numerical elements (integers in examples)
      - same shape and dtype as input_array
  - name: adjacent_pair
    type: tuple or sub-array
    properties:
      - contains two consecutive elements from the input_array (e.g., at index i and i+1)
  - name: last_element (implicit)
    type: number
    properties:
      - exists only if input_array has an odd number of elements
      - corresponds to the final element in the array, which is not part of a swapped pair

actions:
  - name: copy_input_array
    input: input_array
    output: working_array
    description: Creates a mutable copy of the input array to allow in-place modifications without altering the original input.
  - name: iterate_and_swap_pairs
    input: working_array
    output: modified_array (the same working_array instance, but modified)
    description: >
      Iterates through the working_array using an index `i` starting at 0 and incrementing by 2.
      For each `i`, if `i+1` is a valid index within the array bounds, it swaps the elements at indices `i` and `i+1` in place.
      If `i+1` is out of bounds (i.e., `i` is the last index of an odd-length array), the element at index `i` is left unchanged for this iteration step.
  - name: return_modified_array
    input: modified_array
    output: output_array
    description: Returns the modified array as the final output.

relationships:
  - The output_array is the result of applying the iterate_and_swap_pairs action to a copy of the input_array.
  - The order of elements in the output_array depends directly on the swapping of adjacent pairs derived from the input_array.
  - The length and element types remain the same between input_array and output_array.
