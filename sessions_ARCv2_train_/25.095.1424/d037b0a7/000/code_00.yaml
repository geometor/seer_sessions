Task: Grid Transformation - Downward Propagation

Objects:
  - Input Grid: A 2D array of integers.
  - Output Grid: A 2D array of integers, derived from the Input Grid.
  - Cells: Individual elements within the grids, containing integer values.
  - Columns: Vertical sequences of cells in the grid.
  - Non-zero Values: Digits other than 0, representing active elements.
  - Zero Values: The digit 0, representing empty space.

Properties:
  - Grid Dimensions: Height and Width (e.g., 3x3 in the examples).
  - Cell Value: The integer contained within a cell.
  - Cell Position: Row and Column index (e.g., (row, col)).

Actions:
  - Iterate: Process the grid column by column.
  - Track: For each column, maintain the value of the most recently encountered non-zero cell above the current position.
  - Fill: If a cell contains a zero and there was a non-zero value encountered above it in the same column, replace the zero with that non-zero value.
  - Copy: Non-zero values from the input grid are preserved in their original positions in the output grid.

Relationships:
  - Vertical Propagation: Non-zero values influence the zero values directly below them within the same column.
  - Column Independence: The transformation in one column does not directly affect other columns, except through the initial state of the input grid.
  - State Dependency: The value assigned to a zero cell depends on the nearest non-zero cell located above it in the same column.
