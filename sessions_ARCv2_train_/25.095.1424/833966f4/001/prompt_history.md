```


**output:**
```
0

```


## train_2

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task takes a list of five single-digit integers as input. The output is a reordered version of the same list of integers. The reordering follows a specific pattern: the first two elements swap positions, the middle element remains in its position, and the last two elements swap positions.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Reorder a list of five integers
Input:
  Type: List
  Length: 5
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Range: Single digit (0-9 inferred from examples)
Output:
  Type: List
  Length: 5
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Source: Same elements as input, reordered
Transformation:
  Action: Swap elements based on position
  Details:
    - Swap the element at index 0 with the element at index 1.
    - Keep the element at index 2 in its original position.
    - Swap the element at index 3 with the element at index 4.
Relationships:
  - Input and Output lists contain the same set of elements.
  - The transformation depends on the index (position) of the elements within the list.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input list of five integers.
2.  Swap the element at the first position (index 0) with the element at the second position (index 1).
3.  Keep the element at the third position (index 2) unchanged.
4.  Swap the element at the fourth position (index 3) with the element at the fifth position (index 4).
5.  Return the modified list.
