Task: Interleave numbers from two input lines

Input:
  - object: Input Data
    properties:
      - format: Two lines of text
      - content: Each line contains a sequence of identical numbers separated by spaces.
      - structure:
          - line_1: Represents the first sequence (e.g., '4 4 4 4 4 4')
          - line_2: Represents the second sequence (e.g., '8 8 8 8 8 8')
    attributes:
      - number_1: The unique number present in line_1 (e.g., 4)
      - number_2: The unique number present in line_2 (e.g., 8)
      - sequence_length: The count of numbers in each input line (e.g., 6)

Output:
  - object: Output Data
    properties:
      - format: Two lines of text
      - content: Each line contains a sequence of alternating numbers derived from the input.
      - structure:
          - output_line_1: Result of interleaving number_1 and number_2, starting with number_1.
          - output_line_2: Result of interleaving number_2 and number_1, starting with number_2.
    attributes:
      - length: Matches the sequence_length of the input lines.

Relationships:
  - output_line_1 is generated by taking number_1, then number_2, then number_1, and so on, for the determined sequence_length.
  - output_line_2 is generated by taking number_2, then number_1, then number_2, and so on, for the determined sequence_length.

Actions:
  - Parse: Extract the unique number from each input line (number_1, number_2).
  - Determine: Find the count of numbers in an input line (sequence_length).
  - Generate: Construct the two output lines by alternating the extracted numbers according to the specified starting number and sequence length.
  - Format: Join the generated numbers with spaces to form the output lines.
