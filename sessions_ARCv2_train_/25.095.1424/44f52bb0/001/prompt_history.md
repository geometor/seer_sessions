Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Input:** The input is consistently a 3x3 grid of numbers.
2.  **Input Values:** The numbers within the grid are always either 0 or 2.
3.  **Output:** The output is always a single integer, specifically either 1 or 7.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to depend on the spatial arrangement or pattern of the '2's within the 3x3 grid. It does not seem to be a simple count or arithmetic operation. Initial hypotheses involving connectivity of the '2's (either by edge or diagonal adjacency) were explored but failed to explain all examples (specifically train_6 for diagonal connectivity and train_4 for edge connectivity).
5.  **Pattern Recognition:** Examining the patterns that produce '1' versus '7' suggests a link to symmetry. Grids producing '1' (train_1, train_5, train_6) exhibit various forms of symmetry, while grids producing '7' (train_2, train_3, train_4) lack these symmetries.
