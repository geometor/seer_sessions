task_elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array (list of lists)
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - cell_values: [0, 2]
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - position: (row, column) coordinates (0-indexed)
      - value: 0 or 2
  - object: pattern_of_twos
    properties:
      - description: The configuration formed by the locations of cells with value 2.
      - attributes:
          - horizontal_symmetry: Boolean (Symmetric across the middle row?)
          - vertical_symmetry: Boolean (Symmetric across the middle column?)
          - main_diagonal_symmetry: Boolean (Symmetric across the top-left to bottom-right diagonal?)
          - anti_diagonal_symmetry: Boolean (Symmetric across the top-right to bottom-left diagonal?)
  - object: output_value
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - possible_values: [1, 7]
relationships:
  - type: dependency
    description: The output_value depends on the symmetry properties of the pattern_of_twos in the input_grid.
actions:
  - action: analyze_symmetry
    description: Evaluate the pattern_of_twos in the input_grid for horizontal, vertical, main diagonal, and anti-diagonal symmetry.
  - action: determine_output
    description: Assign output 1 if any symmetry is found, otherwise assign output 7.
