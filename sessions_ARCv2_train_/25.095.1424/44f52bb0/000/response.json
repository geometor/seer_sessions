It does not seem to be a simple count or arithmetic operation. Initial hypotheses involving connectivity of the '2's (either by edge or diagonal adjacency) were explored but failed to explain all examples (specifically train_6 for diagonal connectivity and train_4 for edge connectivity).\n5.  **Pattern Recognition:** Examining the patterns that produce '1' versus '7' suggests a link to symmetry. Grids producing '1' (train_1, train_5, train_6) exhibit various forms of symmetry, while grids producing '7' (train_2, train_3, train_4) lack these symmetries.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
