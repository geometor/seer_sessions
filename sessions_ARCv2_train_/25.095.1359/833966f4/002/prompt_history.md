**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming an input list of five single-digit integers into an output list of the same length and containing the same integers, but potentially in a different order. The transformation rule appears to operate on pairs of elements within the list. Specifically, the first pair (indices 0 and 1) is conditionally swapped based on their values, the middle element (index 2) remains unchanged, and the last pair (indices 3 and 4) is unconditionally swapped.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Reorder elements in a list of integers based on specific pair-wise rules.
Input:
  Type: List
  Element_Type: Integer
  Length: 5
  Structure: [val_0, val_1, val_2, val_3, val_4]
Output:
  Type: List
  Element_Type: Integer
  Length: 5
  Structure: [new_val_0, new_val_1, new_val_2, new_val_3, new_val_4]
Relationships:
  - Pair_1: Elements at index 0 and 1.
  - Middle_Element: Element at index 2.
  - Pair_2: Elements at index 3 and 4.
Actions:
  - Compare: Check if the element at index 0 is greater than the element at index 1.
  - Conditional_Swap: Swap elements at index 0 and 1 if the condition (element[0] > element[1]) is true.
  - Unconditional_Swap: Swap elements at index 3 and 4 regardless of their values.
  - Preserve: Keep the element at index 2 in its original position relative to the modified pairs.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept an input list of five integers.
2.  Examine the first pair of integers (at index 0 and index 1). If the integer at index 0 is greater than the integer at index 1, swap their positions. Otherwise, leave them in their original order.
3.  The integer at index 2 remains in its position.
4.  Examine the last pair of integers (at index 3 and index 4). Swap their positions unconditionally.
5.  Construct the output list using the (potentially swapped) first pair, the original middle integer, and the swapped last pair.
```python
import copy

"""
Accepts a list of five integers.
Conditionally swaps the first pair (indices 0, 1) if the first element is greater than the second.
Keeps the middle element (index 2) in its place.
Unconditionally swaps the last pair (indices 3, 4).
Returns the rearranged list.

Assumes the input list[list[int]] represents a single column grid,
e.g., [[9], [0], [1], [6], [8]], and returns the output in the same format.
