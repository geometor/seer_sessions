**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming an input list of five single-digit integers into an output list of the same length and containing the same integers, but potentially in a different order. The transformation rule appears to operate on pairs of elements within the list. Specifically, the first pair (indices 0 and 1) is conditionally swapped based on their values, the middle element (index 2) remains unchanged, and the last pair (indices 3 and 4) is unconditionally swapped.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Reorder elements in a list of integers based on specific pair-wise rules.
Input:
  Type: List
  Element_Type: Integer
  Length: 5
  Structure: [val_0, val_1, val_2, val_3, val_4]
Output:
  Type: List
  Element_Type: Integer
  Length: 5
  Structure: [new_val_0, new_val_1, new_val_2, new_val_3, new_val_4]
Relationships:
  - Pair_1: Elements at index 0 and 1.
  - Middle_Element: Element at index 2.
  - Pair_2: Elements at index 3 and 4.
Actions:
  - Compare: Check if the element at index 0 is greater than the element at index 1.
  - Conditional_Swap: Swap elements at index 0 and 1 if the condition (element[0] > element[1]) is true.
  - Unconditional_Swap: Swap elements at index 3 and 4 regardless of their values.
  - Preserve: Keep the element at index 2 in its original position relative to the modified pairs.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept an input list of five integers.
2.  Examine the first pair of integers (at index 0 and index 1). If the integer at index 0 is greater than the integer at index 1, swap their positions. Otherwise, leave them in their original order.
3.  The integer at index 2 remains in its position.
4.  Examine the last pair of integers (at index 3 and index 4). Swap their positions unconditionally.
5.  Construct the output list using the (potentially swapped) first pair, the original middle integer, and the swapped last pair.
