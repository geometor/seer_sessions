Task: Reorder elements in a list of integers based on specific pair-wise rules.
Input:
  Type: List
  Element_Type: Integer
  Length: 5
  Structure: [val_0, val_1, val_2, val_3, val_4]
Output:
  Type: List
  Element_Type: Integer
  Length: 5
  Structure: [new_val_0, new_val_1, new_val_2, new_val_3, new_val_4]
Relationships:
  - Pair_1: Elements at index 0 and 1.
  - Middle_Element: Element at index 2.
  - Pair_2: Elements at index 3 and 4.
Actions:
  - Compare: Check if the element at index 0 is greater than the element at index 1.
  - Conditional_Swap: Swap elements at index 0 and 1 if the condition (element[0] > element[1]) is true.
  - Unconditional_Swap: Swap elements at index 3 and 4 regardless of their values.
  - Preserve: Keep the element at index 2 in its original position relative to the modified pairs.
