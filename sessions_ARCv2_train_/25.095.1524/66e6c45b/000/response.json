A noticeable feature is a central 2x2 block containing non-zero digits, while the surrounding border cells are zeros.\n*   **Output Structure:** The output is also a 4x4 grid. The non-zero numbers from the input's central block appear relocated to the four corner positions of the output grid. The remaining cells in the output grid are zeros.\n*   **Transformation:** The core operation seems to be extracting the numbers from the 2x2 central block of the input and repositioning them to the corners of the output grid. The relative positions (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) within the central block appear to be preserved when moved to the corners.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
