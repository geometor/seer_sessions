Scans the input 3x3 grid, identifies the unique non-zero digit, counts its occurrences, 
and returns a flat list containing that digit repeated as many times as it appeared in the input grid.

def transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[int]:
    """
    Transforms a 3x3 grid of integers into a flat list.

    The function finds all non-zero elements in the input grid and returns
    a list containing these non-zero elements. Based on the examples, it's
    assumed that all non-zero elements in a given grid have the same value.
    The length of the output list corresponds to the count of non-zero elements.

    Args:
        input_grid: A 3x3 list of lists containing integers (0-9).

    Returns:
        A flat list containing the non-zero digit from the input grid,
        repeated according to its frequency in the grid.
