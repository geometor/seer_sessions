## Perception

The input is consistently a 3x3 grid containing single-digit non-negative integers. The grid typically contains multiple zeros and one or more instances of a single non-zero digit. The output is a flat list (or sequence) of integers. The integers in the output list are always the same as the non-zero digit found in the input grid. The length of the output list corresponds to the count of the non-zero digit in the input grid.

## Facts


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array (list of lists)
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - contains: cells
  - name: cell
    type: element of the grid
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - position: row_index, column_index
  - name: non_zero_number
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: > 0
      - count: number of times it appears in the input_grid
  - name: output_sequence
    type: 1D array (list)
    properties:
      - contains: repetitions of the non_zero_number
      - length: equal to the count of the non_zero_number in the input_grid

actions:
  - name: scan_grid
    description: Iterate through all cells of the input_grid.
  - name: identify_non_zero
    description: Find the value of the number that is not zero within the grid. Assume there is only one unique non-zero value per grid based on examples.
  - name: count_occurrences
    description: Count how many times the identified non_zero_number appears in the input_grid.
  - name: generate_output
    description: Create the output_sequence by repeating the non_zero_number a number of times equal to its count.

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    from: input_grid
    to: output_sequence
    description: The non-zero elements of the input grid determine the content and length of the output sequence.
  - type: correspondence
    element1: non_zero_number value
    element2: value of elements in output_sequence
    description: The value repeated in the output sequence is the unique non-zero value found in the input grid.
  - type: correspondence
    element1: count of non_zero_number in input_grid
    element2: length of output_sequence
    description: The number of elements in the output sequence is equal to the number of times the non-zero value appears in the input grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input 3x3 grid to identify all non-zero numbers.
2.  Determine the unique non-zero value present in the grid (assuming only one unique non-zero value exists per grid based on the examples).
3.  Count the total number of occurrences of this unique non-zero value within the grid.
4.  Construct the output sequence by repeating the unique non-zero value exactly as many times as its counted occurrences.
