task_elements:
  - element: Input Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array (list of lists)
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - cell_values: integers (0 or 2)
  - element: Output Value
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - possible_values: [1, 7]
relationships:
  - relationship: Adjacency Check
    description: The core logic involves checking if any two cells containing the value '2' share a common edge (are horizontally or vertically adjacent). Diagonal adjacency is not considered.
transformation:
  - condition: If any two '2's in the input grid are adjacent (horizontally or vertically).
    action: Output the integer 7.
  - condition: If no two '2's in the input grid are adjacent.
    action: Output the integer 1.
