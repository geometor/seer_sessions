task_elements:
  - element: Input Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array (list of lists)
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - cell_values: integers (0 or 2)
  - element: Output Value
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - possible_values: [1, 7]
objects:
  - object: Group of '2' cells
    properties:
      - coordinates: list of (row, column) tuples where grid value is 2
      - count: total number of '2' cells (N)
actions:
  - action: Check 4-way Adjacency
    description: Determine if any cell containing '2' has a neighbor (up, down, left, or right) that also contains '2'.
    output: boolean (`found_4way_adjacency`)
  - action: Check 8-way Connectivity
    description: If N > 1, determine if all cells containing '2' form a single connected component using 8-way adjacency (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors).
    output: boolean (`is_connected_8way`) (implicitly false if N <= 1)
transformation:
  - description: Determine the output based on the results of the adjacency and connectivity checks.
  - rule:
      if: `found_4way_adjacency` is true AND `is_connected_8way` is true
      then: Output the integer 7.
      else: Output the integer 1.
