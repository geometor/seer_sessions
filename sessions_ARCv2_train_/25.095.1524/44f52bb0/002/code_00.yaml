task_elements:
  - element: Input Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array (list of lists)
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - cell_values: integers (0 or 2)
  - element: Output Value
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - possible_values: [1, 7]
relationships:
  - relationship: Connectivity Check (8-way)
    description: The core logic involves checking the connectivity of all cells containing the value '2'. Connectivity considers horizontal, vertical, and diagonal adjacency (Moore neighborhood).
transformation:
  - step: 1. Identify all cells containing the value '2'.
  - step: 2. Count the total number of cells containing '2'.
  - step: 3. Determine the number of connected components formed by these '2's, using 8-way adjacency (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
  - condition: If the total number of '2's is greater than 1 AND the number of connected components is exactly 1.
    action: Output the integer 7.
  - condition: Otherwise (if zero '2's, one '2', or multiple connected components).
    action: Output the integer 1.
