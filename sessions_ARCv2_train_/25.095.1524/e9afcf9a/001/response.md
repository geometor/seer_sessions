"""
Transforms a grid of two rows, where each row contains a sequence of identical numbers, 
into a new grid of two rows. The first output row alternates between the number 
from the first input row (N1) and the number from the second input row (N2), 
starting with N1. The second output row alternates between N2 and N1, starting 
with N2. The length of the rows remains the same.
