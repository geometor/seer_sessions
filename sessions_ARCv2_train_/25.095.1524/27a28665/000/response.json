The key elements are:\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** A 3x3 matrix containing integers. The digit '0' appears to represent an empty or background cell, while non-zero digits mark specific positions.\n2.  **Non-Zero Pattern:** The arrangement of non-zero digits within the grid forms a distinct geometric shape or pattern. The actual value of the non-zero digit does not seem to influence the output, only its presence and position. All provided examples have exactly 5 non-zero elements.\n3.  **Output Value:** A single integer that acts as an identifier or classification code for the specific pattern formed by the non-zero elements in the input grid.\n\nThe core logic appears to be pattern recognition: identifying the shape formed by the non-zero elements and mapping that shape to a predefined integer code.\n\n## Factual Documentation\n\n"
