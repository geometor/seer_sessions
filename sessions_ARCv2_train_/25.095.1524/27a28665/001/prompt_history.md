## Perception of Elements

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers into a single integer output. The key elements are:

1.  **Input Grid:** A 3x3 matrix containing integers. The digit '0' appears to represent an empty or background cell, while non-zero digits mark specific positions.
2.  **Non-Zero Pattern:** The arrangement of non-zero digits within the grid forms a distinct geometric shape or pattern. The actual value of the non-zero digit does not seem to influence the output, only its presence and position. All provided examples have exactly 5 non-zero elements.
3.  **Output Value:** A single integer that acts as an identifier or classification code for the specific pattern formed by the non-zero elements in the input grid.

The core logic appears to be pattern recognition: identifying the shape formed by the non-zero elements and mapping that shape to a predefined integer code.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the 3x3 input grid.
2.  Identify the coordinates (row, column) of all cells containing non-zero values.
3.  Analyze the spatial arrangement of these non-zero coordinates to determine the geometric shape they form.
4.  Compare the identified shape against a predefined set of known shapes:
    *   If the shape matches an 'L' pattern (or its rotations/reflections, characterized by a 2x2 block with one corner removed, plus one adjacent cell), output the integer `3`.
    *   If the shape matches a '+' pattern (center cell plus its four orthogonal neighbors), output the integer `6`.
    *   If the shape matches an 'X' pattern (center cell plus the four corner cells), output the integer `2`.
    *   If the shape matches an 'S' or 'Z' pattern (or its rotations/reflections, characterized by specific adjacent and diagonal connections), output the integer `1`.
5.  Return the corresponding integer code for the matched shape.
