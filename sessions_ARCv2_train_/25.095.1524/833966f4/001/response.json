(i.e., `i % 3 == 0`), the elements at index `i` and `i+1` are swapped, and the index advances by 2.\nIf `i` is 2, 5, 8, ... (i.e., `i % 3 == 2`), the element at index `i` is kept in its relative position, and the index advances by 1.\nThe process continues until the index reaches the end of the list.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Helper function (not strictly necessary for this logic but good practice)\ndef swap_elements(data: list, index1: int, index2: int):\n    \"\"\"Swaps elements at two specified indices in a list.\"\"\"\n    data[index1], data[index2] = data[index2], data[index1]\n\ndef transform(input_list: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the positional transformation rule to the input list.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list: A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        A new list with elements rearranged according to the rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a copy to avoid modifying the original list\n    output_list = list(input_list)\n    n = len(output_list)\n    \n    # Initialize index\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the list applying the transformation rule\n    while i < n:\n        # Check if the current index is the start of a pair to be swapped\n        # This corresponds to indices 0, 3, 6, ... which satisfy i % 3 == 0\n        if i % 3 == 0:\n            # Check if there's a next element to swap with\n            if i + 1 < n:\n                # Swap elements at index i and i+1\n                swap_elements(output_list, i, i + 1)\n                # Advance index by 2 because we processed two elements (the swapped pair)\n                i += 2\n            else:\n                # If it's the last element and should start a swap, it remains unchanged\n                # Advance index by 1 to finish\n                i += 1\n        # Check if the current index corresponds to an element to be kept\n        # This corresponds to indices 2, 5, 8, ... which satisfy i % 3 == 2\n        elif i % 3 == 2:\n            # Keep the element, just advance the index by 1\n            i += 1\n        else:\n             # This case (i % 3 == 1) should theoretically not be reached \n             # due to the i+=2 step after a swap, but adding safety break.\n             # Or handle potential errors if logic assumption is wrong.\n             # Let's assume the derived logic is correct and this state isn't hit.\n             # If it were hit, it means we are at index 1, 4, 7... which \n             # were already handled by the swap (i+=2).
