from typing import List

"""
Transforms a list of single-digit numbers by rearranging elements based on their position.
The transformation follows a pattern: swap the elements at indices 0 and 1, keep the element at index 2, swap the elements at indices 3 and 4, keep the element at index 5, and so on.
This is achieved by iterating through the list with an index `i`. 
If `i` is 0, 3, 6, ... (i.e., `i % 3 == 0`), the elements at index `i` and `i+1` are swapped, and the index advances by 2.
If `i` is 2, 5, 8, ... (i.e., `i % 3 == 2`), the element at index `i` is kept in its relative position, and the index advances by 1.
The process continues until the index reaches the end of the list.
