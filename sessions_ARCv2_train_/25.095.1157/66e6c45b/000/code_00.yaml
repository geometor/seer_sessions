Task: Relocate central 2x2 block elements to grid corners.

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Size: 4x4
    - Cells: Contain single-digit integers.
    - Pattern: Zeros dominate, except for a 2x2 subgrid located at rows 1-2 and columns 1-2 (0-indexed) which contains non-zero digits.
  Objects:
    - Grid: The overall 4x4 structure.
    - Cells: Individual elements within the grid.
    - Central Block: The 2x2 subgrid containing non-zero values at (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).

Output:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Size: 4x4
    - Cells: Contain single-digit integers.
    - Pattern: Zeros dominate, except for the four corner cells.
  Objects:
    - Grid: The overall 4x4 structure.
    - Cells: Individual elements within the grid.
    - Corner Cells: Positions (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3).

Transformation:
  Action: Move and Map
  Details:
    - The four non-zero digits from the input's central 2x2 block are moved to the output grid's corner positions.
    - The mapping preserves relative positions:
      - Input (1,1) -> Output (0,0) (Top-Left)
      - Input (1,2) -> Output (0,3) (Top-Right)
      - Input (2,1) -> Output (3,0) (Bottom-Left)
      - Input (2,2) -> Output (3,3) (Bottom-Right)
    - All other positions in the output grid are set to 0.
  Relationship:
    - The output grid's corner values are directly sourced from the input grid's central 2x2 block values.
    - The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical (4x4).
