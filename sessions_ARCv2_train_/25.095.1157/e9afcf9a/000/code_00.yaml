task_elements:
  - object: Input
    properties:
      - type: text block
      - structure: two lines
      - line_content: sequence of identical numbers separated by spaces
      - line_count: 2
      - number_per_line: 1 (unique value)
      - element_count_per_line: N (consistent within an example)
  - object: Output
    properties:
      - type: text block
      - structure: two lines
      - line_content: sequence of alternating numbers separated by spaces
      - line_count: 2
      - element_count_per_line: N (matches input)
  - object: Number1
    properties:
      - source: First input line
      - role: Element used in output generation
  - object: Number2
    properties:
      - source: Second input line
      - role: Element used in output generation
  - object: SequenceLength
    properties:

relationships:
  - type: Transformation
    description: The input numbers and sequence length are used to generate the output lines.
  - type: Patterning
    description: Output lines are formed by alternating Number1 and Number2.
    details:
      - First output line pattern starts with Number1 (Number1, Number2, Number1, ...).
      - Second output line pattern starts with Number2 (Number2, Number1, Number2, ...).
actions:
  - action: Parse Input
    steps:
      - Read the first line to identify Number1 and SequenceLength.
      - Read the second line to identify Number2.
  - action: Generate Output Line 1
    steps:
      - Create a sequence of length SequenceLength.
      - Fill the sequence by alternating Number1 and Number2, starting with Number1.
      - Format the sequence as space-separated numbers.
  - action: Generate Output Line 2
    steps:
      - Create a sequence of length SequenceLength.
      - Fill the sequence by alternating Number2 and Number1, starting with Number2.
      - Format the sequence as space-separated numbers.
  - action: Format Output
    steps:
      - Combine the generated Output Line 1 and Output Line 2, separated by a newline character.
