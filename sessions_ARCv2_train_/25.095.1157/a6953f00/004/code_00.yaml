task_description: Extract a 2x2 subgrid from the first two rows of an input grid and format it as a specific string. The starting columns for extraction depend on the parity of the input grid's width.
constraints:
  - Input grid must have at least 2 rows.
  - Input grid must have at least 2 columns.
elements:
  - object: input_grid_string
    properties:
      - type: string
      - format: Multi-line, space-separated integers representing a 2D grid.
      - rows: variable (R >= 2)
      - columns: variable (N >= 2)
  - object: intermediate_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (e.g., list of lists or NumPy array)
      - derived_from: input_grid_string
  - object: output_string
    properties:
      - type: string
      - format: Two lines; each line contains two space-separated integers. Lines are separated by a newline character.
      - content: Represents a 2x2 subgrid extracted from intermediate_grid.
actions:
  - action: parse_input
    input: input_grid_string
    output: intermediate_grid, number_of_columns (N)
  - action: determine_start_column
    input: number_of_columns (N)
    logic: |
      If N is even, start_column = N - 2.
      If N is odd, start_column = 0.
    output: start_column_index
  - action: extract_subgrid_values
    input:
      - intermediate_grid
      - start_column_index
    logic: |
      Select four integer values from intermediate_grid:
      val_00 = grid[0, start_column_index]
      val_01 = grid[0, start_column_index + 1]
      val_10 = grid[1, start_column_index]
      val_11 = grid[1, start_column_index + 1]
    output: val_00, val_01, val_10, val_11
  - action: format_output_string
    input: val_00, val_01, val_10, val_11
    logic: |
      Construct a string:
      Line 1: "{val_00} {val_01}"
      Line 2: "{val_10} {val_11}"
      Combine lines with a newline character in between.
    output: output_string
relationships:
  - relationship: dependency
    subject: output_string
    verb: is derived from
    object: input_grid_string
  - relationship: conditional_logic
    subject: start_column_index
    verb: depends on
    object: parity of the number of columns (N) in intermediate_grid
  - relationship: positional_extraction
    subject: extracted_subgrid_values
    description: Always uses the first two rows (index 0 and 1) of the intermediate_grid.
validation_issue:
  - description: Previous execution errors indicate the validation framework might misinterpret the formatted string output, attempting to parse it as a single integer instead of comparing strings. The transformation logic itself correctly produces the expected output strings based on the examples.
