"""
Extracts a 2x2 subgrid from the input grid. The extraction starts from the first two rows.
The starting column depends on the width (number of columns) of the input grid:
- If the width is even, the subgrid is taken from the last two columns (columns N-2 and N-1).
- If the width is odd, the subgrid is taken from the first two columns (columns 0 and 1).
