"""
Transforms a 3x3 input grid of single-digit integers into a 3x3 output grid.
The output grid is filled entirely with a single digit determined as follows:
1. Count the frequency of each digit (0-9) in the input grid.
2. Identify the digit(s) with the highest frequency (mode(s)).
3. If there's only one mode, use that digit.
4. If there are multiple modes (a tie in frequency), use the largest digit among the modes.
5. Fill the 3x3 output grid with this chosen digit.
