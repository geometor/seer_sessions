Non-zero digits seem to represent distinct objects or colors.\n3.  **Transformation Nature:** The output grid retains the non-zero values from the input but fills some of the '0' cells with non-zero values present in the input. The positions of the original non-zero values are preserved.\n4.  **Columnar Influence:** The changes seem to happen primarily within columns. A non-zero value appears to influence the '0' cells directly below it in the same column.\n5.  **Downward Propagation:** Non-zero values seem to \"fall\" or \"propagate\" downwards, replacing any '0's encountered until they hit the bottom of the grid or another non-zero value.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
