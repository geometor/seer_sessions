task_elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - cell_type: integer (0-9)
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - state: 
          - zero (background/empty)
          - non-zero (object/color)
actions:
  - action: process_columns_independently
    description: The transformation logic is applied to each column separately.
  - action: propagate_downward
    description: Non-zero values fill the zero cells located directly below them within the same column.
relationships:
  - relationship: vertical_adjacency
    description: The value of a cell can be determined by the value of the cell(s) directly above it in the same column.
    constraints: Only non-zero values propagate downwards into zero cells.
