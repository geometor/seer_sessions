"""
Process the grid column by column. Within each column, iterate from top to bottom. Keep track of the most recently encountered non-zero value in that column. If a zero cell is encountered, replace it with the most recently seen non-zero value from above in the same column. If no non-zero value has been seen above a zero cell in the column, leave it as zero. Non-zero cells retain their original value.
