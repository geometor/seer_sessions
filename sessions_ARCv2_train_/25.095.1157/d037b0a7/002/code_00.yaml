task_elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array (matrix)
      - dimensions: 3x3 (consistent across examples)
      - cell_type: integer
      - background_value: 0
      - foreground_values: non-zero integers (represent distinct entities/colors)
  - object: column
    properties:
      - treated_independently: True
actions:
  - action: copy_input_to_output
    description: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - action: scan_columns_top_down
    description: Iterate through each column from top to bottom.
  - action: track_last_non_zero
    description: Maintain the value of the most recently encountered non-zero cell within the current column scan.
  - action: fill_zeros_downward
    description: If the current cell is zero and a non-zero value has been encountered above it in the same column, update the current cell in the output grid with the tracked non-zero value.
relationships:
  - relationship: column_dependency
    description: The final value of a zero cell depends only on the non-zero cells located above it within the same column.
  - relationship: value_preservation
    description: Non-zero cells in the input retain their original value and position in the output.
constraints:
  - Propagation is strictly vertical (downward) within columns.
  - Only the *last* non-zero value encountered scanning downwards influences subsequent zeros in that column.
  - If a column contains only zeros, or if zeros appear before any non-zero value, they remain zero.
