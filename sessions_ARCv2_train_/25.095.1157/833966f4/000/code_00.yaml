objects:
  - name: input_list
    type: List[Integer]
    description: An ordered sequence of single-digit integers.
  - name: output_list
    type: List[Integer]
    description: An ordered sequence containing the same integers as the input_list, but rearranged.
  - name: element
    type: Integer
    description: A single-digit integer within the lists.
  - name: pair
    type: Tuple[Integer, Integer]
    description: Two adjacent elements taken from the input_list.

actions:
  - name: iterate
    actor: system
    object: input_list
    description: Process the input list sequentially, typically in steps of two.
  - name: select_pair
    actor: system
    object: input_list
    description: Identify adjacent elements (e.g., at index i and i+1) to form a pair.
  - name: swap
    actor: system
    object: pair
    description: Reverse the order of the two elements within a selected pair.
  - name: append
    actor: system
    object: element or pair
    target: output_list
    description: Add elements (potentially swapped) to the end of the output list being constructed.
  - name: handle_odd_element
    actor: system
    object: element
    description: If the input list has an odd number of elements, append the last element without swapping.

relationships:
  - type: element_conservation
    source: input_list
    target: output_list
    description: The output_list contains exactly the same elements as the input_list, with the same frequency.
  - type: length_conservation
    source: input_list
    target: output_list
    description: The output_list has the same number of elements as the input_list.
  - type: positional_transformation
    source: input_list
    target: output_list
    description: The position of elements in the output_list is determined by swapping adjacent pairs from the input_list. Elements at indices (0, 1) swap, (2, 3) swap, and so on. The last element remains if the count is odd.
