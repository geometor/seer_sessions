**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves taking a list of single-digit integers as input and rearranging them to produce an output list. Both input and output lists contain the same elements and have the same length. The rearrangement follows a specific pattern: adjacent pairs of elements in the input list are swapped in the output list. If the input list has an odd number of elements, the last element remains in its final position.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_list
    type: List[Integer]
    description: An ordered sequence of single-digit integers.
  - name: output_list
    type: List[Integer]
    description: An ordered sequence containing the same integers as the input_list, but rearranged.
  - name: element
    type: Integer
    description: A single-digit integer within the lists.
  - name: pair
    type: Tuple[Integer, Integer]
    description: Two adjacent elements taken from the input_list.

actions:
  - name: iterate
    actor: system
    object: input_list
    description: Process the input list sequentially, typically in steps of two.
  - name: select_pair
    actor: system
    object: input_list
    description: Identify adjacent elements (e.g., at index i and i+1) to form a pair.
  - name: swap
    actor: system
    object: pair
    description: Reverse the order of the two elements within a selected pair.
  - name: append
    actor: system
    object: element or pair
    target: output_list
    description: Add elements (potentially swapped) to the end of the output list being constructed.
  - name: handle_odd_element
    actor: system
    object: element
    description: If the input list has an odd number of elements, append the last element without swapping.

relationships:
  - type: element_conservation
    source: input_list
    target: output_list
    description: The output_list contains exactly the same elements as the input_list, with the same frequency.
  - type: length_conservation
    source: input_list
    target: output_list
    description: The output_list has the same number of elements as the input_list.
  - type: positional_transformation
    source: input_list
    target: output_list
    description: The position of elements in the output_list is determined by swapping adjacent pairs from the input_list. Elements at indices (0, 1) swap, (2, 3) swap, and so on. The last element remains if the count is odd.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty list called `output_list`.
2.  Iterate through the `input_list` using an index `i`, starting from 0 and incrementing by 2 in each step.
3.  Check if the next index (`i + 1`) is within the bounds of the `input_list`.
4.  If `i + 1` is a valid index:
    a.  Append the element from `input_list` at index `i + 1` to the `output_list`.
    b.  Append the element from `input_list` at index `i` to the `output_list`.
5.  If `i + 1` is *not* a valid index (meaning `i` points to the last element of an odd-length list):
    a.  Append the element from `input_list` at index `i` to the `output_list`.
6.  Return the `output_list`.
