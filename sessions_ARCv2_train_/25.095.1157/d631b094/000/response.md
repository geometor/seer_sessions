Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and describe the transformation rule.

## Perception of Task Elements

The input is consistently a 3x3 grid containing single-digit integers. Many cells contain the digit 0, while others contain a single non-zero digit (e.g., 7 in example 1, 2 in example 2, 8 in example 3, 1 in example 4).

The output is a sequence of integers. The length of the output sequence corresponds to the number of non-zero elements present in the input grid. The values in the output sequence are the non-zero digits found in the input grid.

The transformation appears to involve extracting the non-zero elements from the input grid and forming an output sequence with them. The order of elements in the output sequence seems to follow a standard reading order (row by row, left to right) of the non-zero elements in the input grid.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array (list of lists)
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - element_type: integer
      - content: contains zero and non-zero single-digit integers

  - object: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: 1D array (list)
      - element_type: integer
      - content: derived from non-zero elements of input_grid

relations:
  - type: derivation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_sequence
    details: The output sequence consists of all non-zero integer values found within the input grid.

  - type: order_correspondence
    element1: non-zero values in input_grid (scanned row-major)
    element2: elements in output_sequence
    details: The order of elements in the output sequence matches the order in which the corresponding non-zero values appear when scanning the input grid row by row, from left to right.

  - type: cardinality_correspondence
    element1: count of non-zero values in input_grid
    element2: length of output_sequence
    details: The number of elements in the output sequence is equal to the total count of non-zero values in the input grid.

actions:
  - name: scan_grid
    input: input_grid
    details: Iterate through the cells of the grid, typically row by row, left to right.
  - name: filter_non_zero
    input: cell_value
    output: cell_value (if non-zero) or nothing (if zero)
    details: Check if the value in a cell is not equal to zero.
  - name: collect_values
    input: non-zero_values
    output: output_sequence
    details: Append the identified non-zero values, in the order they were encountered during the scan, to form the final output sequence.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty list to store the output sequence.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from top to bottom (row index 0 to 2).
3.  Within each row, iterate through each cell, from left to right (column index 0 to 2).
4.  For each cell, check if the number it contains is not zero.
5.  If the number is not zero, append this number to the end of the output sequence list.
6.  After iterating through all cells in the grid, the final output sequence list is the result.
