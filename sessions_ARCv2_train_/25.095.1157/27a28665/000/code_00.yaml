Input:
  type: grid
  dimensions: 3x3
  cell_type: integer
  value_range: 0-9
  properties:
    - Contains 0s and one unique non-zero digit per grid.
    - The non-zero digits form a spatial pattern.

Output:
  type: integer

Transformation:
  focus: Spatial pattern of non-zero cells
  operation: Connected components analysis
  connectivity: Von Neumann neighborhood (shared edges only)
  steps:
    - Identify all non-zero cells in the input grid.
    - Determine the number of connected components formed by these non-zero cells, considering cells connected only if they share a common edge.
    - Map the resulting component count to a specific output value based on the observed examples.
  mapping:
    1_component: 6
    2_components: 3
    3_components: 1
    5_components: 2
