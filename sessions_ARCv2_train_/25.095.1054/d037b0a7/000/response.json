The digit '0' appears to function as a background or empty space.\n*   Non-zero digits (colors) seem to \"fall\" or propagate downwards within their columns.\n*   If a cell contains '0' and the cell directly above it contains a non-zero digit, the '0' is replaced by that non-zero digit.\n*   This downward propagation continues until the bottom of the grid is reached or another non-zero digit is encountered in the same column below the original propagating digit.\n*   The process occurs independently for each column.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
