objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array of integers
    properties:
      - dimensions (rows, columns)
  - name: cell
    type: element within the grid
    properties:
      - position (row, column)
      - value (integer)
  - name: color
    type: non-zero integer value in a cell
  - name: background
    type: zero integer value in a cell

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Cells are arranged in rows and columns. Each cell (except top row) has a cell directly above it in the same column.
  - type: state_change
    description: The value of a background cell can change based on the value of the cell above it.

actions:
  - name: propagate_downward
    actor: color
    target: background cell
    condition: The background cell is below the color cell in the same column, and all intermediate cells (if any) are also background cells.
    effect: The background cell's value changes to the color's value.
    scope: Occurs independently within each column.

grid_properties:
  - input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - transformation modifies cell values based on column-wise rules.
