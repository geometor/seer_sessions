**Perception:**

The input is a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. The output is also a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. A key observation is that the output grid is always uniform, consisting of a single digit repeated in all cells. This repeated digit appears to be derived from the input grid. By examining the examples, the digit chosen for the output grid is the one that appears most frequently in the input grid.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: Grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      cell_type: single_digit_integer
  - name: output_grid
    type: Grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      cell_type: single_digit_integer
      uniform: true # All cells contain the same digit
  - name: digit
    type: Integer
    properties:
      value: 0-9
      frequency: count_in_input_grid

actions:
  - name: calculate_frequency
    input: input_grid
    output: frequency_map (digit -> count)
  - name: find_most_frequent_digit
    input: frequency_map
    output: most_frequent_digit
    logic: Identify the digit with the highest count. If there's a tie, select the largest digit among the tied ones.
  - name: construct_output_grid
    input: most_frequent_digit, dimensions (3x3)
    output: output_grid
    logic: Create a grid of the specified dimensions and fill all cells with the most_frequent_digit.

relationships:
  - The value filling the output_grid is the most_frequent_digit found in the input_grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input 3x3 grid of digits.
2.  Count the occurrences (frequency) of each unique digit within the input grid.
3.  Determine the digit that has the highest frequency.
4.  If multiple digits share the highest frequency, select the digit with the largest numerical value among them.
5.  Construct a new 3x3 grid.
6.  Fill every cell of the new grid with the digit identified in the previous step (the most frequent, or the largest among tied most frequent).
7.  Output the newly constructed grid.
