"""
Transforms an input grid (likely a NumPy array) of integers into a 2x2 output grid.
The transformation rule depends on the parity of the number of columns (C)
in the input grid:
- If C is odd, the output is the top-left 2x2 subgrid.
- If C is even, the output is the top-right 2x2 subgrid.
Handles potential NumPy array input based on previous error analysis.
