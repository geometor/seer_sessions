Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both 4x4 grids containing single-digit integers.
*   The input grid has non-zero digits located exclusively within the central 2x2 subgrid (rows 1 and 2, columns 1 and 2, using 0-based indexing). The rest of the input grid cells contain zeros.
*   The output grid takes the four non-zero digits from the input's central 2x2 subgrid and places them at the four corner positions of the output grid.
*   All other cells in the output grid are filled with zeros.
*   The mapping is consistent:
    *   The top-left element of the input's central 2x2 block moves to the top-left corner `(0,0)` of the output.
    *   The top-right element of the input's central 2x2 block moves to the top-right corner `(0,3)` of the output.
    *   The bottom-left element of the input's central 2x2 block moves to the bottom-left corner `(3,0)` of the output.
    *   The bottom-right element of the input's central 2x2 block moves to the bottom-right corner `(3,3)` of the output.

```yaml
Objects:
  - InputGrid:
      type: grid
      properties:
        size: 4x4
        cells: integer digits
        background_value: 0
        active_region: central 2x2 subgrid (rows 1-2, cols 1-2)
  - OutputGrid:
      type: grid
      properties:
        size: 4x4
        cells: integer digits
        background_value: 0
        active_region: corner cells (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3)
  - CentralSubgrid:
      type: subgrid (part of InputGrid)
      properties:
        size: 2x2
        position: rows 1-2, cols 1-2
        values: non-zero digits from InputGrid
  - CornerCells:
      type: set of cells (part of OutputGrid)
      properties:
        positions: [(0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3)]
        values: derived from CentralSubgrid

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the central 2x2 subgrid within the InputGrid.
  - Extract: Get the four values from the cells of the CentralSubgrid.
  - Initialize: Create a new 4x4 OutputGrid filled with the background value (0).
  - Place: Assign the extracted values to the CornerCells of the OutputGrid according to a specific mapping.

Relationships:
  - Mapping:
      - InputGrid cell (1,1) value -> OutputGrid cell (0,0) value
      - InputGrid cell (1,2) value -> OutputGrid cell (0,3) value
      - InputGrid cell (2,1) value -> OutputGrid cell (3,0) value
      - InputGrid cell (2,2) value -> OutputGrid cell (3,3) value
  - Content Preservation: The non-zero values from the InputGrid's central area are preserved and relocated in the OutputGrid.
  - Structure Change: The arrangement of non-zero values changes from a central block to corner positions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize a new 4x4 grid (the output grid) with all cells set to 0.
2.  Identify the four values in the input grid located at positions `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 1)`, and `(2, 2)`.
3.  Place the value from input position `(1, 1)` into the output grid at position `(0, 0)`.
4.  Place the value from input position `(1, 2)` into the output grid at position `(0, 3)`.
5.  Place the value from input position `(2, 1)` into the output grid at position `(3, 0)`.
6.  Place the value from input position `(2, 2)` into the output grid at position `(3, 3)`.
7.  The final output grid contains these four values at the corners and zeros elsewhere.
