            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code (`code_00.py`) correctly identified the need for swapping elements but implemented the wrong pattern. It swapped consecutive pairs (0,1), (2,3), (4,5), etc. However, analyzing the discrepancies between the code's output and the *expected* output across all examples reveals a different pattern: swap pair (0,1), leave element 2, swap pair (3,4), leave element 5, and so on. The transformation operates on groups of three elements, swapping the first two and leaving the third. If the list ends with fewer than three elements after the last full group, the remaining one or two elements are handled as follows: if one remains, it's left unchanged; if two remain, they are swapped. The reported failure for `train_1` (incorrect size and content) appears inconsistent with the code's logic and the pattern seen in other examples; it might be an anomaly in the test report or indicate a subtle input handling issue, but the primary focus should be correcting the swapping pattern.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n*   **train_1:**\n    *   Input: `[9, 0, 1, 6, 8]` (Length 5)\n    *   Expected Output: `[0, 9, 1, 8, 6]`\n    *   `code_00.py` Output (Expected based on logic): `[0, 9, 6, 1, 8]`\n    *   `code_00.py` Output (Reported): `[1, 9, 8, 6]` (Length 4) - *This reported output seems erroneous based on the code.*\n    *   Analysis: Expected logic swaps (0,1) -> `[0, 9, 1, 6, 8]`, leaves 2 (`1`), swaps (3,4) -> `[0, 9, 1, 8, 6]`. The code incorrectly swapped (2,3) instead of (3,4).\n*   **train_2:**\n    *   Input: `[4, 3, 6, 2, 8]` (Length 5)\n    *   Expected Output: `[3, 4, 6, 8, 2]`\n    *   `code_00.py` Output (Reported): `[3, 4, 2, 6, 8]`\n    *   Analysis: Expected logic swaps (0,1) -> `[3, 4, 6, 2, 8]`, leaves 2 (`6`), swaps (3,4) -> `[3, 4, 6, 8, 2]`. The code incorrectly swapped (2,3) instead of (3,4). Matches the pattern.\n*   **test_1:**\n    *   Input: `[4, 5, 6, 7, 2]` (Length 5)\n    *   Expected Output: `[5, 4, 6, 2, 7]`\n    *   `code_00.py` Output (Reported): `[5, 4, 7, 6, 2]`\n    *   Analysis: Expected logic swaps (0,1) -> `[5, 4, 6, 7, 2]`, leaves 2 (`6`), swaps (3,4) -> `[5, 4, 6, 2, 7]`. The code incorrectly swapped (2,3) instead of (3,4). Matches the pattern.\n\n**Revised Facts:**\n\n"
