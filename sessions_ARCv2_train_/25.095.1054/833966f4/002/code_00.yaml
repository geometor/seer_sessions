objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - elements: integers
      - order: significant
      - source: flattened input grid (list of single-element lists)
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - elements: integers (same set as input_sequence)
      - order: derived from input_sequence
      - format: list of single-element lists
actions:
  - name: process_groups_of_three
    description: Iterates through the input sequence considering groups of three elements at indices (3k, 3k+1, 3k+2) for k = 0, 1, 2, ...
  - name: swap_first_two_in_group
    description: Within each group of three, swap the elements at indices 3k and 3k+1. The element at index 3k+2 remains in its relative position.
  - name: handle_remainder
    description: If the list length is not a multiple of 3, process the remaining elements. If one element remains (at index 3k), leave it unchanged. If two elements remain (at indices 3k, 3k+1), swap them.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: The output_sequence is generated by applying the process_groups_of_three, swap_first_two_in_group, and handle_remainder actions to the input_sequence. The final sequence is then formatted back into a list of single-element lists.
