objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - elements: single-digit integers
      - order: significant
      - length: variable (denoted as N)
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - elements: single-digit integers (same multiset as input_sequence)
      - order: derived from input_sequence
      - length: N (same as input_sequence)
actions:
  - name: process_in_groups_of_three
    description: Iterates through the input sequence with a step of 3 (indices i = 0, 3, 6, ...).
  - name: swap_first_two_in_group
    description: For each group starting at index i, if the second element (index i+1) exists, swap the elements at indices i and i+1. The third element (index i+2), if it exists, remains in its relative position.
    condition: Applies only if index i+1 is within the sequence bounds.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: The output_sequence is generated by applying the 'process_in_groups_of_three' action to the input_sequence. Within each group processed, the 'swap_first_two_in_group' action is performed. If the sequence length is not a multiple of 3, the remaining elements are processed as follows: if two elements remain, they are swapped; if one element remains, it is left unchanged.
