Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Data Type:** Both input and output consist of lists of single-digit integers.
*   **Structure:** The lists maintain their length from input to output.
*   **Content:** The numbers present in the output list are the same as the numbers in the input list, indicating a reordering operation.
*   **Transformation Pattern (`train_1`):**
    *   Input: `[9, 0, 1, 6, 8]`
    *   Output: `[0, 9, 1, 8, 6]`
    *   Comparing element positions:
        *   `9` (index 0) moves to index 1.
        *   `0` (index 1) moves to index 0.
        *   `1` (index 2) stays at index 2.
        *   `6` (index 3) moves to index 4.
        *   `8` (index 4) moves to index 3.
    *   Observation: Elements at indices (0, 1) are swapped. Element at index 2 remains. Elements at indices (3, 4) are swapped.
*   **Transformation Pattern (`train_2`):**
    *   Input: `[4, 3, 6, 2, 8]`
    *   Output: `[3, 4, 6, 8, 2]`
    *   Comparing element positions:
        *   `4` (index 0) moves to index 1.
        *   `3` (index 1) moves to index 0.
        *   `6` (index 2) stays at index 2.
        *   `2` (index 3) moves to index 4.
        *   `8` (index 4) moves to index 3.
    *   Observation: Elements at indices (0, 1) are swapped. Element at index 2 remains. Elements at indices (3, 4) are swapped.
*   **General Observation:** The transformation appears to swap adjacent pairs of elements in the list. It iterates through the list, taking elements two at a time (index 0 and 1, then index 2 and 3, etc.) and swaps their positions. If the list has an odd number of elements, the last element remains in its original position.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_list
    type: list
    properties:
      - elements: integers
      - order: significant
  - name: output_list
    type: list
    properties:
      - elements: integers (same set as input_list)
      - order: derived from input_list
actions:
  - name: swap_adjacent_pairs
    description: Iterates through the input list, swapping elements at indices i and i+1 for i = 0, 2, 4, ...
    condition: Only proceeds if index i+1 is within the list bounds.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_list
    output: output_list
    rule: The output_list is generated by applying the swap_adjacent_pairs action to the input_list. Elements that are not part of a pair (i.e., the last element of an odd-length list) retain their original position relative to the start of the processing.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input list.
2.  Create a copy of the input list to modify.
3.  Iterate through the indices of the list, starting at index 0 and incrementing by 2 for each step (i.e., process indices 0, 2, 4, ...).
4.  For the current index `i`, check if the next index `i+1` exists within the list bounds.
5.  If index `i+1` exists, swap the elements at index `i` and index `i+1` in the copied list.
6.  If index `i+1` does not exist (meaning `i` is the last index and the list has an odd length), do nothing for this index.
7.  After iterating through all possible starting pair indices, return the modified list as the output.
```python
import math

"""
Transforms the input list by swapping adjacent pairs of elements. 
Iterates through the list with a step of 2 (indices 0, 2, 4, ...). 
For each starting index 'i', if the next index 'i+1' is within the list bounds, 
the elements at indices 'i' and 'i+1' are swapped. 
If the list has an odd number of elements, the last element remains in its position.
The input is expected as a list of lists, where each inner list contains one integer, 
representing the digits line by line. The transformation operates on the sequence 
of these integers. The output is formatted similarly as a list of lists.
