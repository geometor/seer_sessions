"""
Generate two output rows by alternating the unique number from each row of the input NumPy array.
The first output row starts with the number from the first input row.
The second output row starts with the number from the second input row.
The alternation continues for the number of columns in the input array.
The output should be a list of lists.

    Transforms a 2D NumPy input grid by interleaving the elements of its two rows.

    Args:
        input_grid: A 2D NumPy array.
                      Expected shape is (2, N) where N > 0.
                      Row 0 contains N repetitions of a single number (num1).
                      Row 1 contains N repetitions of a different single number (num2).
                      Example: np.array([[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]])

        A list containing two lists of integers representing the interleaved output.
