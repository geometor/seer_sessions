**output:**
```
4 8 4 8 4 8
8 4 8 4 8 4
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 3

*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input consists of two lines, each containing a sequence of identical numbers separated by spaces.
    *   The output also consists of two lines, each containing a sequence of numbers separated by spaces.
    *   The length of the sequences in the input lines is consistent within an example (e.g., 6 in both examples).
    *   The output lines appear to be generated by interleaving the numbers from the two input lines.
    *   The first output line starts with the number from the first input line and alternates with the number from the second input line.
    *   The second output line starts with the number from the second input line and alternates with the number from the first input line.
    *   The length of the output sequences matches the length of the input sequences.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - input_line_1:
          type: string
          description: A sequence of identical numbers separated by spaces.
          properties:
            - number_value: The repeated number in the sequence.
            - length: The count of numbers in the sequence.
      - input_line_2:
          type: string
          description: A sequence of identical numbers separated by spaces, different from input_line_1.
          properties:
            - number_value: The repeated number in the sequence.
            - length: The count of numbers in the sequence.
      - output_line_1:
          type: string
          description: A sequence of alternating numbers derived from input lines.
      - output_line_2:
          type: string
          description: A sequence of alternating numbers derived from input lines.
    relationships:
      - input_line_1 and input_line_2 have the same length.
      - output_line_1 and output_line_2 are derived from input_line_1 and input_line_2.
      - output_line_1 and output_line_2 have the same length as the input lines.
    actions:
      - parse: Extract the repeated number and length from each input line.
      - interleave: Create output lines by alternating the numbers from the input lines.
      - format: Join the numbers with spaces to form the output strings.
    transformation_pattern:
      - rule: Generate two output lines by alternating the single number from each input line.
      - detail_1: The first output line starts with the number from the first input line.
      - detail_2: The second output line starts with the number from the second input line.
      - detail_3: The alternation continues for the length of the input sequences.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Read the first input line and identify its repeated number (let's call it `num1`) and its length (let's call it `length`).
    2.  Read the second input line and identify its repeated number (let's call it `num2`).
    3.  Initialize two empty lists, `output1_elements` and `output2_elements`.
    4.  Iterate `length` times (using an index `i` from 0 to `length - 1`):
        a.  If the index `i` is even (0, 2, 4, ...):
            i.  Append `num1` to `output1_elements`.
            ii. Append `num2` to `output2_elements`.
        b.  If the index `i` is odd (1, 3, 5, ...):
            i.  Append `num2` to `output1_elements`.
            ii. Append `num1` to `output2_elements`.
    5.  Join the elements in `output1_elements` with spaces to create the first output line string.
    6.  Join the elements in `output2_elements` with spaces to create the second output line string.
    7.  Print the first output line string.
    8.  Print the second output line string.
