Objects:
  - Grid: A 2D array of cells.
  - Cell: An element within the grid, identified by row and column index.
  - Value: The number contained within a cell (0-9).

Properties:
  - Cell:
    - location: (row, column)
    - value: The digit it holds.
    - is_zero: Boolean (true if value is 0, false otherwise).
  - Grid:
    - dimensions: (height, width)

Actions:
  - Check_Above: For a given cell (r, c), examine the value of the cell at (r-1, c).
  - Update_Value: Change the value of a cell.
  - Iterate: Repeat a process over the grid until no values change.

Relationships:
  - Propagation: A non-zero value in a cell (r-1, c) can influence the value of a cell (r, c) if cell (r, c) is zero.
  - Stability: The final output is reached when an iteration produces no changes compared to the previous iteration.
  - Dependency: The update for a cell (r, c) in the current iteration depends on the value of the cell (r-1, c) in the *previous* iteration's grid state.
