Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception:**

The input and output are both grids of the same dimensions (3x3 in the examples) containing single digits. The core transformation involves filling in the '0' cells based on the non-zero values present in the input grid. Specifically, non-zero values seem to propagate downwards into any '0' cells directly below them. This downward propagation continues layer by layer until all reachable '0' cells below a non-zero value have been filled, or until the bottom of the grid is reached. If a cell starts as non-zero, it retains its value. The process appears iterative; a cell filled in one step can then cause the cell below it to be filled in a subsequent step. The process stops when a pass over the grid results in no changes.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Objects:
  - Grid: A 2D array of cells.
  - Cell: An element within the grid, identified by row and column index.
  - Value: The number contained within a cell (0-9).

Properties:
  - Cell:
    - location: (row, column)
    - value: The digit it holds.
    - is_zero: Boolean (true if value is 0, false otherwise).
  - Grid:
    - dimensions: (height, width)

Actions:
  - Check_Above: For a given cell (r, c), examine the value of the cell at (r-1, c).
  - Update_Value: Change the value of a cell.
  - Iterate: Repeat a process over the grid until no values change.

Relationships:
  - Propagation: A non-zero value in a cell (r-1, c) can influence the value of a cell (r, c) if cell (r, c) is zero.
  - Stability: The final output is reached when an iteration produces no changes compared to the previous iteration.
  - Dependency: The update for a cell (r, c) in the current iteration depends on the value of the cell (r-1, c) in the *previous* iteration's grid state.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid.
2.  Repeatedly iterate through the grid until a full iteration pass makes no changes to any cell values:
    a.  Create a copy of the grid state from the beginning of the current iteration (let's call it `previous_grid`).
    b.  For each cell in the grid at position (row `r`, column `c`):
        i.  If the cell's value in `previous_grid` at (`r`, `c`) is 0:
            1. Check the cell directly above it at (`r-1`, `c`) in `previous_grid`.
            2. If the cell above exists (i.e., `r > 0`) and its value in `previous_grid` is non-zero, update the current grid's cell at (`r`, `c`) to this non-zero value.
    c.  Compare the current grid state to the `previous_grid`. If they are identical, stop iterating.
3.  The final grid state after iterations stop is the output grid.
