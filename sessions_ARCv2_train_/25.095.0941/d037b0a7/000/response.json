The core transformation involves filling in the '0' cells based on the non-zero values present in the input grid. Specifically, non-zero values seem to propagate downwards into any '0' cells directly below them. This downward propagation continues layer by layer until all reachable '0' cells below a non-zero value have been filled, or until the bottom of the grid is reached. If a cell starts as non-zero, it retains its value. The process appears iterative; a cell filled in one step can then cause the cell below it to be filled in a subsequent step. The process stops when a pass over the grid results in no changes.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
