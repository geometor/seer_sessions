Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input:** The input is consistently a square grid of single-digit integers. The size of the grid varies across examples (4x4, 3x3, 5x5).
*   **Output:** The output is always a smaller, 2x2 grid of single-digit integers.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation involves selecting a specific 2x2 subgrid from the input grid. The location of this 2x2 subgrid appears to depend on the dimensions of the input grid.
    *   In `train_1` (4x4 input), the output is the top-right 2x2 subgrid.
    *   In `train_2` (3x3 input) and `train_3` (5x5 input), the output is the top-left 2x2 subgrid.
*   **Pattern:** There seems to be a conditional rule based on the parity (even/odd) of the input grid's dimensions. If the dimensions are even (e.g., 4x4), the top-right 2x2 subgrid is selected. If the dimensions are odd (e.g., 3x3, 5x5), the top-left 2x2 subgrid is selected.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid of numbers.
2.  Determine the number of rows (which is equal to the number of columns) in the input grid.
3.  Check if the number of rows is even or odd.
4.  If the number of rows is even:
    a.  Identify the top-right 2x2 subgrid. This subgrid starts at row index 0 and column index (number of columns - 2).
    b.  Extract this 2x2 subgrid.
5.  If the number of rows is odd:
    a.  Identify the top-left 2x2 subgrid. This subgrid starts at row index 0 and column index 0.
    b.  Extract this 2x2 subgrid.
6.  Output the extracted 2x2 subgrid.
