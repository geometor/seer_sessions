The output is also a multi-line string containing the same digits as the input, but rearranged. The core operation appears to be a reordering of the input sequence. By comparing the input and output sequences in both examples, a pattern emerges: adjacent pairs of numbers are swapped. For instance, the first number swaps places with the second, the third swaps with the fourth, and so on. If the input sequence contains an odd number of elements, the last element remains in its position relative to the preceding swapped pairs.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
