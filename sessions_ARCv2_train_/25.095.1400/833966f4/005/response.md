```python
"""
Transforms an input sequence of numbers by swapping the first two elements and the last two elements.
The input is provided as a single-column grid (list of lists), and the output is returned in the same format.
If the sequence has fewer than 2 elements, it remains unchanged.
If the sequence has 2 or 3 elements, only the first two are swapped.
If the sequence has 4 or more elements, both the first two and the last two pairs are swapped.
Middle elements (between the first and last pairs) remain in their original positions relative to each other.
