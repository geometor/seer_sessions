"""
Identifies all cells containing '0' in the input 3x3 grid.
Counts the number of distinct connected components formed by these '0' cells,
where connectivity is defined by horizontal or vertical adjacency (Von Neumann neighborhood).
Outputs 1 if the number of connected components is zero or one.
Outputs 7 if the number of connected components is greater than one.
