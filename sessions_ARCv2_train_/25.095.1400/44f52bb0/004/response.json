            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis using 8-way connectivity for the '2' cells failed on `train_6`. The expected output was 1, but the code produced 7 because the '2' cells formed a single 8-connected component. This indicates that the simple rule \"output 7 if C2=1, else 1\" is incorrect.\n\nRevisiting the examples and analyzing the relationship between the 4-way connectivity of '0' cells (`C0`) and the 8-way connectivity of '2' cells (`C2`) revealed a more nuanced pattern:\n\n*   Output is generally 1 when `C2` > 1.\n*   Output is generally 7 when `C2` = 1.\n*   The exception is `train_6`, where `C2` = 1 and `C0` = 4, resulting in an output of 1.\n\nThis suggests a rule based on both `C0` and `C2`. The strategy is to:\n1.  Verify the counts of `C0` (4-way) and `C2` (8-way) for all examples using code execution.\n2.  Formulate a natural language program based on the refined hypothesis: Output 1 if `C2 > 1` OR if (`C2 == 1` AND `C0 == 4`). Output 7 if (`C2 == 1` AND `C0 != 4`).\n3.  Document the findings in the YAML format.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nUsing code execution to count the components:\n*   `C0`: Number of 4-connected components of cells with value 0.\n*   `C2`: Number of 8-connected components of cells with value 2.\n"
