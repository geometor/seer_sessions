Identifies all cells containing '2' in the input 3x3 grid.
Counts the number of distinct connected components formed by these '2' cells,
where connectivity is defined by horizontal, vertical, or diagonal adjacency (Moore neighborhood, 8-way).
Outputs 7 if the number of connected components of '2's is exactly one.
Outputs 1 if the number of connected components is zero or greater than one.
