Task: Grid Topology Classification

Input:
  Type: 2D Grid
  Dimensions: 3x3
  Cell_Values:
    - 0: Represents background space
    - 2: Represents foreground objects or barriers

Output:
  Type: Single Digit Integer
  Possible_Values:
    - 1: Represents one topological state
    - 7: Represents a different topological state

Derived_Properties:
  - C0_4way: The number of connected components formed by '0' cells, using 4-way adjacency (Von Neumann neighborhood: up, down, left, right).
  - C2_8way: The number of connected components formed by '2' cells, using 8-way adjacency (Moore neighborhood: includes diagonals).

Relationship:
  Rule: The output depends on the combination of the number of 8-connected components of '2's (C2_8way) and the number of 4-connected components of '0's (C0_4way).
  Condition_for_Output_1:
    - The number of 8-connected components of '2's (C2_8way) is not equal to 1.
    - OR, the number of 8-connected components of '2's (C2_8way) is exactly 1 AND the number of 4-connected components of '0's (C0_4way) is exactly 4.
  Condition_for_Output_7:
    - The number of 8-connected components of '2's (C2_8way) is exactly 1 AND the number of 4-connected components of '0's (C0_4way) is not equal to 4.

Examples_Analysis:
  - train_1: C0=1, C2=2 -> C2 != 1 -> Output 1
  - train_2: C0=2, C2=1 -> C2 == 1 and C0 != 4 -> Output 7
  - train_3: C0=1, C2=1 -> C2 == 1 and C0 != 4 -> Output 7
  - train_4: C0=2, C2=1 -> C2 == 1 and C0 != 4 -> Output 7  (Note: Previous manual check had C0=3, code check shows C0=2. Let's re-verify train_4 manually. 200/200/020 -> 0s at (0,1),(0,2),(1,1),(1,2),(2,0). (0,1)-(0,2), (1,1)-(1,2), (0,1)-(1,1), (0,2)-(1,2). These four form Component 1. (2,0) is isolated. Component 2. Yes, C0=2 is correct.)
  - train_5: C0=1, C2=2 -> C2 != 1 -> Output 1
  - train_6: C0=4, C2=1 -> C2 == 1 and C0 == 4 -> Output 1
