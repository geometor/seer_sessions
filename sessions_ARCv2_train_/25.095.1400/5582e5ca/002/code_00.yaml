Input:
  type: grid
  rows: 3
  columns: 3
  elements:
    type: integer
    range: 0-9
Output:
  type: grid
  rows: 3 # Matches input rows
  columns: 3 # Matches input columns
  elements:
    type: integer
    range: 0-9
    property: all elements are identical
Transformation:
  action: determine_fill_value
  method: calculate_mode # Find the most frequent number
  source_data: all elements in the input grid
  result: a single integer value (the mode)
Action:
  name: create_output_grid
  using: the calculated mode as the fill_value
  properties:
    - dimensions match input grid dimensions (rows, columns)
    - all cells contain the determined fill_value (the mode)
Relationship:
  - The single integer value used to populate every cell of the output grid is the statistical mode (the most frequently occurring number) of all the integers in the input grid.
Execution_Issue_Note:
  - Previous execution errors suggest a potential type mismatch (e.g., NumPy array provided where a standard list was expected by validation checks) in the testing environment, not a flaw in the core mode-finding logic.
