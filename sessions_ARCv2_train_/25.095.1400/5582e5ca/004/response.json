            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code failed because it assumed the input grid was a standard Python `list` of `list`s, while the execution environment likely provided it as a `numpy.ndarray`. The error message `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` confirms this, as it arises when a multi-element NumPy array is used in a boolean context (like `if not input_grid:`).\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously \u2013 finding the most frequent number (mode) in the input grid and filling an output grid of the same dimensions with that mode \u2013 appears correct based on visual inspection and manual calculation for all training examples.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the code to correctly handle NumPy array inputs, specifically by:\n1.  Adjusting checks for empty or invalid input to use NumPy-specific methods (e.g., checking `.size`).\n2.  Leveraging NumPy functions where beneficial (e.g., `flatten()` for collecting all numbers, potentially `np.unique` and `np.argmax` for mode finding, although `collections.Counter` is also effective and clear).\n3.  Ensuring the output is also returned in the expected format (presumably a NumPy array if the input is NumPy, or converting back to list-of-lists if required, although consistency suggests NumPy output).\n\n**Metrics and Evidence:**\n\nCode execution confirmed the following:\n\n*   **Input Type:** The input grid is provided as a `numpy.ndarray`.\n*   **Error Source:** The condition `if not input_grid:` raises a `ValueError` when `input_grid` is a non-empty NumPy array. The appropriate check for emptiness is `if input_grid.size == 0`.\n*   **Mode Verification:** Manual calculation and `tool_code` execution confirmed the mode for each training example:\n    *   `train_1`: Input `[[6 8 9] [1 8 1] [9 4 9]]`, Numbers `[6, 8, 9, 1, 8, 1, 9, 4, 9]`, Mode = `9`. Output `[[9 9 9] [9 9 9] [9 9 9]]`. Matches.\n    *   `train_2`: Input `[[4 4 8] [6 4 3] [6 3 0]]`, Numbers `[4, 4, 8, 6, 4, 3, 6, 3, 0]`, Mode = `4`. Output `[[4 4 4] [4 4 4] [4 4 4]]`. Matches.\n    *   `train_3`: Input `[[4 6 9] [6 4 1] [8 8 6]]`, Numbers `[4, 6, 9, 6, 4, 1, 8, 8, 6]`, Mode = `6`. Output `[[6 6 6] [6 6 6] [6 6 6]]`. Matches.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
