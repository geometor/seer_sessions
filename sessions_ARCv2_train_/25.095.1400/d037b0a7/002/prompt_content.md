```python
import copy

"""
Fill '0' cells downwards within each column based on the nearest non-zero value above them.

1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Iterate through each column of the grid.
3. Within each column, iterate through the rows from top to bottom.
4. Maintain the last seen non-zero value for the current column.
5. If the current cell in the input grid is non-zero, update the last seen non-zero value.
6. If the current cell in the input grid is zero and a non-zero value has been seen above it in the same column, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to the last seen non-zero value.
