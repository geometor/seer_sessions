'0' appears to be a background or empty state. Non-zero digits (2, 7, 8, 6, 4, 3) seem to represent filled states or objects.\n*   **Transformation:** The change from input to output involves filling '0' cells based on the non-zero values above them within the same column. Non-zero values seem to propagate downwards, filling any '0' cells below them until they hit another non-zero value or the bottom of the grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
