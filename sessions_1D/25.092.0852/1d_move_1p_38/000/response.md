**Perception:**

The task involves operating on single-row grids (1xN). Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels. The transformation involves shifting this block one position to the right. The size and color of the block remain unchanged. The space vacated by the block on its left becomes white.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 2D 1xN grid)
input_features:
  - object:
      type: contiguous_block
      color: non-white (variable, e.g., yellow, green)
      location: variable position within the row
      count: exactly one per input
  - background:
      color: white (0)
      extent: surrounds the non-white block
output_features:
  - object:
      type: contiguous_block
      color: same as input block
      location: shifted one position to the right compared to input
      count: exactly one per output
  - background:
      color: white (0)
      extent: surrounds the non-white block, including the original leftmost position of the block
transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift
  direction: right
  distance: 1 pixel
  target: the single non-white contiguous block
  constraints:
    - grid dimensions remain unchanged
    - color of the block remains unchanged
    - number of blocks remains one
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels in the input row.
2.  Determine the starting and ending column indices of this block.
3.  Create an output row of the same dimensions as the input row, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
4.  Copy the identified block from the input row into the output row, placing its starting position at the input starting column index plus one.
