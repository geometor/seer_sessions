task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 2D 1xN grid)
input_features:
  - object:
      type: contiguous_block
      color: non-white (variable, e.g., yellow, green)
      location: variable position within the row
      count: exactly one per input
  - background:
      color: white (0)
      extent: surrounds the non-white block
output_features:
  - object:
      type: contiguous_block
      color: same as input block
      location: shifted one position to the right compared to input
      count: exactly one per output
  - background:
      color: white (0)
      extent: surrounds the non-white block, including the original leftmost position of the block
transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift
  direction: right
  distance: 1 pixel
  target: the single non-white contiguous block
  constraints:
    - grid dimensions remain unchanged
    - color of the block remains unchanged
    - number of blocks remains one
