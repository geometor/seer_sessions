task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 2D (operationally 1D, acts on single row)
background_color: 0 # white
input_grid_structure: 2D NumPy array, typically with one row.
output_grid_structure: 2D NumPy array, same dimensions as input.
objects:
  - object_type: segment # contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels
    count: 1 (per row)
    location: Confined to the first row in all examples.
    properties:
      - color: non-zero (varies: 3, 5, 1)
      - shape: horizontal line segment
      - contiguity: True
      - length: Varies (14 or 15 pixels in examples)
actions:
  - action_type: translation
    direction: right
    magnitude: 1 pixel
    target: the non-white segment in the first row
    effects:
        - The pixel originally at the segment's start index becomes white (0).
        - The pixel originally at the position one step right of the segment's end index takes the segment's color.
constraints:
  - size_preservation: True # Grid dimensions remain constant.
  - object_preservation: True # Segment color and length remain constant.
  - dimensionality_preservation: True # Input and Output are 2D arrays of the same shape.
