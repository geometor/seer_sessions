**Perception of the Elements:**

The input and output are 1-dimensional grids (single rows). Each input grid contains a single contiguous horizontal segment of a non-white color (e.g., green, gray, blue) surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The transformation consistently involves shifting this colored segment one position to the right. The length and color of the segment remain unchanged. The white background pixels fill the space vacated by the shift on the left and are overwritten by the shift on the right.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1D as it's a single row
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - object_type: segment # contiguous horizontal block
    count: 1
    properties:
      - color: non-zero (varies per example: 3, 5, 1)
      - shape: horizontal line segment
      - contiguity: True
actions:
  - action_type: translation
    direction: right
    magnitude: 1 pixel
    target: the non-white segment
constraints:
  - size_preservation: True # Grid dimensions do not change
  - object_preservation: True # Segment color and length do not change
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels within the input row.
2.  Determine the starting column index and the ending column index of this segment.
3.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).
4.  Copy the identified non-white segment from the input row into the output row, placing its starting pixel one column index to the right of its original starting position.
