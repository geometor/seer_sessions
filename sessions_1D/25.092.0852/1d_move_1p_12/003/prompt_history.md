**Perception of the Elements:**

The input and output are 1-dimensional grids (single rows). Each input grid contains a single contiguous horizontal segment of a non-white color (e.g., green, gray, blue) surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The transformation consistently involves shifting this colored segment one position to the right. The length and color of the segment remain unchanged. The white background pixels fill the space vacated by the shift on the left and are overwritten by the shift on the right.

**YAML Facts:**

  - object_type: segment # contiguous horizontal block
    count: 1

      - color: non-zero (varies per example: 3, 5, 1)
      - shape: horizontal line segment
      - contiguity: True
actions:
  - action_type: translation
    direction: right
    magnitude: 1 pixel
    target: the non-white segment
constraints:

  - object_preservation: True # Segment color and length do not change
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels within the input row.
2.  Determine the starting column index and the ending column index of this segment.
3.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).
4.  Copy the identified non-white segment from the input row into the output row, placing its starting pixel one column index to the right of its original starting position.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment:**

The previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation rule: shifting a single contiguous segment of non-white pixels one position to the right within a single row grid. The error reported (`ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`) strongly suggests that the input grids, although presented as 1D lists in the prompt for clarity, are actually handled as 2D NumPy arrays by the execution environment (likely `[[...]]`). The code attempted to iterate over what it thought was a list of pixels but was actually iterating over the rows of the 2D array. Since there was only one row, the first element iterated was the entire row array itself, leading to the ambiguous boolean comparison when checking `pixel != 0`.

The strategy is to adjust the code to explicitly handle 2D NumPy array inputs, extract the relevant row (the first one in these examples), apply the shifting logic to that row, and return the result as a 2D NumPy array.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's verify the properties of the segments and the shift using code execution.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input as a 2D grid (NumPy array).
2.  Identify the first row of the input grid.
3.  Scan the first row to find the single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels. Determine its starting column index, ending column index, and color.
4.  Create a new 2D grid (NumPy array) of the same dimensions as the input, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).
5.  Copy the identified non-white segment from the input grid's first row into the first row of the new output grid, but shift its position one column to the right (i.e., its new starting column index is the original starting index + 1).
6.  Ensure the segment placement respects the grid boundaries (although not observed to be an issue in examples, it's good practice).
7.  Return the new 2D grid.
