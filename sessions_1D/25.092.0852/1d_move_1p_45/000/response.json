Each input contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (blue '1' or magenta '6') surrounded by white '0' pixels. The transformation consistently involves shifting this entire contiguous block of non-white pixels exactly one position to the right within the flattened 1D array representation. The position originally occupied by the leftmost pixel of the block becomes white '0', and the pixel immediately to the right of the block's original rightmost position takes on the value of that rightmost pixel.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
