            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed the input `input_grid` was a 1D list or array. The error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" indicated that a NumPy array was being treated as a single boolean value. This occurred because the code attempted to iterate over `list(input_grid)`, where `input_grid` was actually a 2D NumPy array (specifically, shape (1, 16)). This resulted in iterating over a list containing a single element: the NumPy array row itself. The comparison `pixel != 0` then compared the entire row array to 0, yielding a boolean array, which caused the error when used in an `if` condition.\n\nThe core logic of identifying a contiguous non-white block and shifting it one position to the right remains valid. The resolution involves correctly handling the 2D NumPy array input format, extracting the relevant row (the first and only row in these examples), applying the block-finding and shifting logic to that row, and constructing the output as a 2D NumPy array of the same shape.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the analysis and tool execution:\n\n*   **Input/Output Shape:** All training examples have input and output shapes of (1, 16).\n*   **Objects:**\n    *   **Background:** White pixels (0). Fills the grid except for the block.\n    *   **Block:** A single contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels.\n        *   Example 1: Color Blue (1), Length 3, Start Index 7.\n        *   Example 2: Color Blue (1), Length 3, Start Index 9.\n        *   Example 3: Color Magenta (6), Length 10, Start Index 1.\n*   **Transformation:** The 'Block' object is shifted horizontally.\n    *   Shift Distance: +1 index (to the right) in all examples.\n*   **Code Execution Results:** The revised code, accounting for the 2D input structure, successfully processed all training examples and produced the expected outputs.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
