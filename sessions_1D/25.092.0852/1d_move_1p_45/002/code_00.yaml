task_type: grid_manipulation
input_representation: 2D grid (numpy array)
output_representation: 2D grid (numpy array)
grid_dimensions:
  - height: 1 (consistent across examples)
  - width: 16 (consistent across examples)
objects:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    description: Fills the grid area not occupied by the block.
  - object: block
    description: A single contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels within the single row.
    properties:
      - color: variable (blue '1' or magenta '6' in examples)
      - length: variable
      - start_column_index: variable
      - end_column_index: variable
      - row_index: 0 (constant for all examples)
transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift
  target: block
  parameters:
    - direction: right
    - distance: 1 column index
  details: The identified block object is moved one position to the right within its row. The grid cell at the original starting column index of the block becomes white (0). Cells to the right of the original block's end index are overwritten by the shifted block.
relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions are identical to the input grid dimensions.
  - The output grid contains the same block object as the input (same color, same length), but positioned one column to the right.
invariants:
  - Grid height and width remain unchanged (1x16).
  - The color of the block remains unchanged.
  - The length of the block remains unchanged.
  - There is only one block object per grid.
  - The background color remains white (0).
  - All activity occurs within the single row of the grid.
