*   **Perception:** The input and output examples appear to represent flattened 1D arrays derived from an underlying grid structure (likely 4x4 given the length of 16). Each input contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (blue '1' or magenta '6') surrounded by white '0' pixels. The transformation consistently involves shifting this entire contiguous block of non-white pixels exactly one position to the right within the flattened 1D array representation. The position originally occupied by the leftmost pixel of the block becomes white '0', and the pixel immediately to the right of the block's original rightmost position takes on the value of that rightmost pixel.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: array_manipulation_1d
    input_representation: flattened_grid (1D array)
    output_representation: flattened_grid (1D array)
    elements:
      - element: background
        color: white (0)
      - element: block
        description: A single contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
        properties:
          - color: variable (blue '1' or magenta '6' in examples)
          - length: variable
          - start_index: variable (in the flattened array)
          - end_index: variable (in the flattened array)
    transformation:
      action: shift_right_1d
      target: block
      parameters:
        - distance: 1 position
      details: The entire identified block is moved one index position to the right in the 1D array. The original leftmost position of the block becomes white (0).
    relationships:
      - The output array is identical to the input array except for the position of the non-white block, which is shifted one position right.
    invariants:
      - The color of the block remains unchanged.
      - The length of the block remains unchanged.
      - The total size of the array (16 elements) remains unchanged.
      - The background color remains white (0).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Treat the input grid as a flattened 1D array.
    2.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels. Determine its starting index (`start`) and ending index (`end`).
    3.  Create a new 1D array of the same size as the input, initialized entirely with white (0) pixels.
    4.  Copy the pixel values from the identified block in the input array (from index `start` to `end`) into the new array, but place them starting at index `start + 1` and ending at index `end + 1`.
    5.  The resulting 1D array is the output.
