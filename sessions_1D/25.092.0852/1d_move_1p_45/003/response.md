```python
"""
Transforms the input grid (a 1x16 2D numpy array) by identifying a single 
contiguous horizontal sequence (block) of non-white pixels within the row. 
This block is then shifted one position to the right in the output grid. 
The grid cell at the original starting column index of the block becomes white (0). 
If no non-white block is found, a grid of the same dimensions filled with white (0) 
is returned.
