*   **Perception:** The input and output examples appear to represent flattened 1D arrays derived from an underlying grid structure (likely 4x4 given the length of 16). Each input contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (blue '1' or magenta '6') surrounded by white '0' pixels. The transformation consistently involves shifting this entire contiguous block of non-white pixels exactly one position to the right within the flattened 1D array representation. The position originally occupied by the leftmost pixel of the block becomes white '0', and the pixel immediately to the right of the block's original rightmost position takes on the value of that rightmost pixel.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Treat the input grid as a flattened 1D array.
    2.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels. Determine its starting index (`start`) and ending index (`end`).
    3.  Create a new 1D array of the same size as the input, initialized entirely with white (0) pixels.
    4.  Copy the pixel values from the identified block in the input array (from index `start` to `end`) into the new array, but place them starting at index `start + 1` and ending at index `end + 1`.
    5.  The resulting 1D array is the output.

Train Set Results:

## Example 2:

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment

The previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed the input `input_grid` was a 1D list or array. The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" indicated that a NumPy array was being treated as a single boolean value. This occurred because the code attempted to iterate over `list(input_grid)`, where `input_grid` was actually a 2D NumPy array (specifically, shape (1, 16)). This resulted in iterating over a list containing a single element: the NumPy array row itself. The comparison `pixel != 0` then compared the entire row array to 0, yielding a boolean array, which caused the error when used in an `if` condition.

The core logic of identifying a contiguous non-white block and shifting it one position to the right remains valid. The resolution involves correctly handling the 2D NumPy array input format, extracting the relevant row (the first and only row in these examples), applying the block-finding and shifting logic to that row, and constructing the output as a 2D NumPy array of the same shape.

## Metrics

Based on the analysis and tool execution:

*   **Input/Output Shape:** All training examples have input and output shapes of (1, 16).
*   **Objects:**
    *   **Background:** White pixels (0). Fills the grid except for the block.
    *   **Block:** A single contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels.
        *   Example 1: Color Blue (1), Length 3, Start Index 7.
        *   Example 2: Color Blue (1), Length 3, Start Index 9.
        *   Example 3: Color Magenta (6), Length 10, Start Index 1.
*   **Transformation:** The 'Block' object is shifted horizontally.
    *   Shift Distance: +1 index (to the right) in all examples.
*   **Code Execution Results:** The revised code, accounting for the 2D input structure, successfully processed all training examples and produced the expected outputs.

  parameters:
    - direction: right
    - distance: 1 column index
  details: The identified block object is moved one position to the right within its row. The grid cell at the original starting column index of the block becomes white (0). Cells to the right of the original block's end index are overwritten by the shifted block.
relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions are identical to the input grid dimensions.
  - The output grid contains the same block object as the input (same color, same length), but positioned one column to the right.
invariants:
  - Grid height and width remain unchanged (1x16).
  - The color of the block remains unchanged.
  - The length of the block remains unchanged.
  - There is only one block object per grid.
  - The background color remains white (0).
  - All activity occurs within the single row of the grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input as a 2D grid (which happens to be 1x16 in the examples).
2.  Focus on the first (and only) row of the grid.
3.  Identify the contiguous horizontal sequence (block) of non-white pixels within this row. Determine its starting column index (`start_col`), ending column index (`end_col`), and color (`block_color`).
4.  If no non-white block is found, return a grid of the same dimensions filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
5.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with white (0) pixels.
6.  Calculate the target starting column index for the shifted block: `new_start_col = start_col + 1`.
7.  Copy the sequence of pixels corresponding to the identified block from the input row (from `start_col` to `end_col`) into the first row of the output grid, starting at `new_start_col`. Ensure copying does not exceed the grid's width boundary.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
