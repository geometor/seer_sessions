task_description: Identify a single contiguous block of non-white pixels within a 1D grid and shift it one position to the right.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN)
  background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (varies: 3, 2, 1)
      shape: horizontal segment
      size: variable length (3, 3, 6 in examples)
      count: 1 per grid
actions:
  - name: identify_block
    input: input_grid
    output: identified_block (color, start_index, length)
  - name: shift_block_right
    input: identified_block
    parameters:
      shift_amount: 1
    output: new_start_index
  - name: reconstruct_grid
    input:
      - original_grid_size
      - identified_block_color
      - identified_block_length
      - new_start_index
    output: output_grid
relationships:
  - input_block and output_block have the same color and length.
  - output_block start_index = input_block start_index + 1.
  - output_grid size = input_grid size.
  - All pixels not part of the shifted block in the output grid are white (0).
