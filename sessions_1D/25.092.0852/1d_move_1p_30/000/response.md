Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN grids).
*   Each grid contains a background of white pixels (0) and a single contiguous block of non-white pixels (e.g., green '3', red '2', blue '1').
*   The non-white block varies in color and length across examples.
*   The position of the non-white block changes between the input and the output.
*   The size and color of the non-white block remain the same between input and output.
*   The overall size of the grid remains the same between input and output.
*   In each example, the non-white block appears to shift one position to the right.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Identify a single contiguous block of non-white pixels within a 1D grid and shift it one position to the right.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN)
  background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: non-white (varies: 3, 2, 1)
      shape: horizontal segment
      size: variable length (3, 3, 6 in examples)
      count: 1 per grid
actions:
  - name: identify_block
    input: input_grid
    output: identified_block (color, start_index, length)
  - name: shift_block_right
    input: identified_block
    parameters:
      shift_amount: 1
    output: new_start_index
  - name: reconstruct_grid
    input:
      - original_grid_size
      - identified_block_color
      - identified_block_length
      - new_start_index
    output: output_grid
relationships:
  - input_block and output_block have the same color and length.
  - output_block start_index = input_block start_index + 1.
  - output_grid size = input_grid size.
  - All pixels not part of the shifted block in the output grid are white (0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid to locate the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels (the "block"). Record its color, starting index, and length.
2.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).
3.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 1 to its original starting index.
4.  Place the identified block (using its recorded color and length) into the new grid starting at the calculated new index.
5.  The resulting grid is the output.
