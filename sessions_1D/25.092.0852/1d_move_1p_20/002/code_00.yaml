task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of non-white pixels in a single-row grid one step to the right, moving the white pixel immediately preceding the block into the block's original start position."
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2 # Represented as 2D array
  shape: 1xN # Always a single row
  max_colors: 2 # White background plus one object color
objects:
  - id: background_pixel
    color_value: 0
    color_name: white
    description: "Forms the background of the grid."
  - id: color_block
    color_value: non-zero (e.g., 4, 6)
    color_name: variable (e.g., yellow, magenta)
    description: "A single contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels."
    properties:
      - contiguous: True
      - uniform_color: True
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "The color_block is always preceded by at least one background_pixel."
  - type: spatial
    description: "The color_block is always followed by at least one background_pixel (allowing shift)."

      1. Copy the input row to create the output row.
      2. Copy the pixels of the color_block (from input index s to e) to the output row at indices s+1 to e+1.
      3. Place the value of the preceding background_pixel (always 0) into the output row at index s.
    preconditions:
      - "Block identified (s != -1)."
      - "Preceding pixel exists (s > 0)."
      - "Space exists to shift (e+1 < grid_width)."
  - action: no_change
    description: "If no block is found, or if it starts at index 0, or if there's no space to shift right, return the input grid unchanged."
