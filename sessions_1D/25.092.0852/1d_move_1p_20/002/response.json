            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code failed execution across all training examples with the same error: \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\". This error typically occurs when a `numpy` array is used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., an `if` statement), but the array contains multiple elements.\n\nGiven that ARC grids are often handled as `numpy` arrays in the backend testing environment, the most likely cause is the initial check `if not input_grid or len(input_grid) != 1:`. The `not input_grid` part attempts boolean evaluation on the entire input array, triggering the error if `input_grid` is passed as a numpy array.\n\nThe core transformation logic (identifying the non-white block, shifting it right, and moving the preceding white pixel) appears correct based on a manual review of the examples. The strategy is to modify the input validation to correctly handle potential `numpy` array inputs while ensuring the core logic operates on standard Python lists as intended. We will adjust the initial check to specifically verify if the input has exactly one row, potentially by converting to a numpy array temporarily for the shape check, then proceeding with list-based operations.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nThe examples provided are consistent:\n1.  **Input/Output:** All examples consist of a single-row input grid and a corresponding single-row output grid.\n2.  **Content:** Each input contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (magenta '6' or yellow '4') surrounded by white '0' pixels.\n3.  **Transformation:** In all cases, the non-white block is shifted one position to the right. The white pixel immediately preceding the block moves to occupy the original starting position of the block.\n4.  **Boundary Condition:** The block never touches the right edge of the grid in the input, allowing space for the shift. The block does not start at index 0 in any example where a transformation occurs (it does start at index 1 or later).\n\n**YAML Facts Block**\n\n"
