**Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code failed execution across all training examples with the same error: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()". This error typically occurs when a `numpy` array is used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., an `if` statement), but the array contains multiple elements.

Given that ARC grids are often handled as `numpy` arrays in the backend testing environment, the most likely cause is the initial check `if not input_grid or len(input_grid) != 1:`. The `not input_grid` part attempts boolean evaluation on the entire input array, triggering the error if `input_grid` is passed as a numpy array.

The core transformation logic (identifying the non-white block, shifting it right, and moving the preceding white pixel) appears correct based on a manual review of the examples. The strategy is to modify the input validation to correctly handle potential `numpy` array inputs while ensuring the core logic operates on standard Python lists as intended. We will adjust the initial check to specifically verify if the input has exactly one row, potentially by converting to a numpy array temporarily for the shape check, then proceeding with list-based operations.

**Metrics**

The examples provided are consistent:
1.  **Input/Output:** All examples consist of a single-row input grid and a corresponding single-row output grid.
2.  **Content:** Each input contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (magenta '6' or yellow '4') surrounded by white '0' pixels.
3.  **Transformation:** In all cases, the non-white block is shifted one position to the right. The white pixel immediately preceding the block moves to occupy the original starting position of the block.
4.  **Boundary Condition:** The block never touches the right edge of the grid in the input, allowing space for the shift. The block does not start at index 0 in any example where a transformation occurs (it does start at index 1 or later).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid, which is expected to be a single row (1xN). Verify this shape; if it's not 1xN, return the input grid unchanged.
2.  Extract the single row from the input grid.
3.  Scan the row to find the start index (`start_index`) and end index (`end_index`) of the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
4.  Check the conditions for transformation:
    *   A non-white block must be found.
    *   The block must not start at the very beginning of the row (`start_index` must be greater than 0).
    *   There must be space to shift the block to the right (i.e., `end_index + 1` must be less than the row's width).
5.  If any of these conditions are not met, return the original input grid unchanged.
6.  If all conditions are met:
    *   Create a copy of the input row to serve as the basis for the output row.
    *   Iterate from `i = start_index` to `end_index`. For each `i`, copy the pixel value from the *input* row at index `i` to the *output* row at index `i + 1`.
    *   Set the pixel value in the *output* row at `start_index` to 0 (white), representing the preceding white pixel moving into the block's original starting position.
7.  Wrap the modified output row into a 2D grid format (list of lists).
8.  Return the transformed grid.
