task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of non-white pixels one step right, moving the preceding white pixel into the block's original start position."
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1 # Essentially 1D arrays presented as 1xN grids
  max_colors: 2 # White background plus one object color
objects:
  - id: background
    color_value: 0
    color_name: white
    description: "Forms the background of the grid."
  - id: color_block
    color_value: non-zero (e.g., 4, 6)
    color_name: variable (e.g., yellow, magenta)
    description: "A single contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels."
    properties:
      - contiguous: True
      - uniform_color: True
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "The color_block is always preceded by at least one background pixel."
  - type: spatial
    description: "The color_block may be followed by zero or more background pixels."
actions:
  - action: identify_block
    target: color_block
    description: "Find the start index (s) and end index (e) of the color_block."
  - action: identify_preceding_pixel
    target: background
    description: "Identify the background pixel at index s-1."
  - action: shift_block
    target: color_block
    description: "Move the pixels originally from index s to e to occupy indices s+1 to e+1."
    constraints:
      - "Requires grid width > e+1." # Implicit from examples
  - action: move_pixel
    target: background pixel at s-1
    description: "Place the background pixel originally at s-1 into the position at index s."
