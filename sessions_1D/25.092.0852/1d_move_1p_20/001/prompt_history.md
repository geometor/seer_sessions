Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are single-row grids (effectively 1-dimensional arrays or vectors).
2.  **Pixel Values:** The grids contain 'white' pixels (value 0) and one other non-white color ('magenta' - 6 or 'yellow' - 4 in the examples).
3.  **Structure:** Each input grid features a single, contiguous block of non-white pixels surrounded by 'white' pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** Comparing inputs and outputs, the core transformation appears to be a shift operation. Specifically, the block of non-white pixels shifts one position to the right. The 'white' pixel immediately preceding the block moves into the position where the block started. The rest of the 'white' pixels maintain their relative order.

**YAML Facts Block:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input row.
2.  Locate the contiguous block of non-white pixels. Determine its starting index (`start_index`) and ending index (`end_index`).
3.  If no non-white block is found, or if the block starts at the very beginning (index 0), return the input unchanged (assumption based on required preceding pixel).
4.  Identify the 'white' pixel immediately before the block, which is located at `start_index - 1`. Store its value (which will be 0).
5.  Create the output row, initially identical to the input row.
6.  Shift the pixels that form the block one position to the right: Iterate from `i = end_index` down to `start_index`. In the output row, set the pixel at index `i + 1` to the value of the pixel at index `i` from the *original* input row (or equivalently, the current state of the output row *before* this specific step in the iteration).
7.  Place the stored 'white' pixel value into the output row at `start_index`.
8.  Return the modified output row.
