task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensions:
  input: 1x30
  output: 1x30
objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    color: non-white (varies per example: magenta, blue, gray)
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - surrounded by white pixels
transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift
  direction: right
  distance: 1 pixel
relationships:
  - The colored segment maintains its color and length.
  - The position of the segment changes relative to the grid boundaries.
invariance:
  - Grid dimensions remain the same.
  - The color of the segment remains the same.
  - The length of the segment remains the same.
  - The background color (white) remains the same, except where affected by the shift.
