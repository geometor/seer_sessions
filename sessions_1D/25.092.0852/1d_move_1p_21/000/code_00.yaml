task_description: Shift the contents of a 1D grid one position to the right.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  size: Constant width (16 pixels in examples)
objects:
  - type: pixel_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      color: Varies (orange, gray, magenta in examples)
      location: Varies in the input grid.
  - type: background
    description: White pixels surrounding the non-white block.
    properties:
      color: white (0)
actions:
  - name: shift_right
    target: Entire grid content
    details: Move all pixels one position to the right.
  - name: fill_leftmost
    target: The first pixel (index 0) of the grid.
    details: Set the value of the first pixel to white (0).
  - name: truncate_rightmost
    target: The last pixel of the original grid content.
    details: The pixel originally at the rightmost position is effectively discarded due to the right shift.
relationships:
  - The non-white block maintains its color and length during the shift.
  - The position of the non-white block changes by +1 index.
  - The overall grid width remains unchanged.
transformation_summary: The entire row of pixels is shifted one step to the right. The pixel that falls off the right edge is discarded. The new leftmost pixel becomes white (0).
