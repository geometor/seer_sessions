The transformation involves shifting this non-white block one position to the right. The pixel that was originally to the left of the block becomes white, and the pixel that was originally to the right of the block takes on the color of the block.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

The leftmost pixel of the original block location becomes white. The pixel immediately to the right of the original block location adopts the block's color.\n```"
