Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

Each example consists of a single row (1D grid) containing a contiguous block of a single non-white color surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The transformation involves shifting this non-white block one position to the right. The pixel that was originally to the left of the block becomes white, and the pixel that was originally to the right of the block takes on the color of the block.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid Properties:
  - Type: 1D array (single row)
  - Size: 1x12 in all examples
  - Background Color: White (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous horizontal block of a single non-white color
  - Examples:
    - train_1: Blue (1) block, length 3
    - train_2: Gray (5) block, length 7
    - train_3: Yellow (4) block, length 7
  - Position: Variable start position within the row.
  - Surrounding: Always surrounded by white (0) pixels in the input.

Transformation:
  - Action: Horizontal shift
  - Direction: Right
  - Distance: 1 pixel
  - Effect: The non-white block moves one position to the right. The leftmost pixel of the original block location becomes white. The pixel immediately to the right of the original block location adopts the block's color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input row. Note its color, starting position, and length.
2.  Create an output row of the same length, initialized with white (0) pixels.
3.  Copy the identified non-white block into the output row, but shifted one position to the right compared to its position in the input row.
