Each input grid consists of a sequence of pixels, primarily white (0), but containing a single contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color (e.g., orange (7) or yellow (4)). The output grid is a transformation of the input grid where the entire sequence of pixels appears to have been shifted. Observing the examples, the shift is consistently one position to the right, with the element originally at the far right wrapping around to the far left position. This is characteristic of a circular or rotational shift operation applied to the row.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
