Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   The input and output data are presented as 1D sequences (or single-row grids) of numbers (colors).
*   Each sequence contains a single contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels. The specific non-white color varies between examples (azure, yellow, magenta).
*   The rest of the sequence consists of white (zero) pixels, located either before, after, or both before and after the non-white block.
*   Comparing inputs and outputs, the primary transformation involves the position of the non-white block.
*   In each example, the non-white block appears to shift one position to the right.
*   The length of the sequence remains constant between the input and the output.
*   The mechanism for the shift seems to be inserting a white pixel immediately before the start of the non-white block and removing the final pixel of the sequence to maintain the original length.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a contiguous block of non-white pixels one position to the right within a 1D sequence, maintaining sequence length.
elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: A 1D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      length: Constant between input and output.
      content: Contains white pixels (0) and a single contiguous block of one non-white color.
  - type: object
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels within the sequence.
    properties:
      color: Varies (azure, yellow, magenta in examples).
      start_index: The index where the block begins in the input sequence.
      length: The number of pixels in the block.
actions:
  - action: find_block_start
    description: Identify the index of the first non-white pixel in the input sequence.
    inputs:
      - input_sequence
    outputs:
      - start_index
  - action: insert_pixel
    description: Insert a white pixel (0) into the sequence at the identified start index.
    inputs:
      - input_sequence
      - start_index
    outputs:
      - intermediate_sequence (length increased by 1)
  - action: truncate_sequence
    description: Remove the last pixel from the intermediate sequence.
    inputs:
      - intermediate_sequence
    outputs:
      - output_sequence (original length restored)
relationships:
  - relation: position_shift
    description: The non-white block in the output sequence starts one index later than in the input sequence.
  - relation: length_conservation
    description: The output sequence has the same number of pixels as the input sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input sequence of pixels.
2.  Find the index of the first pixel in the sequence that is not white (color 0). Let this be `start_index`.
3.  Create a new sequence by inserting a white pixel (0) into the input sequence at `start_index`.
4.  Remove the last pixel from this new sequence.
5.  The resulting sequence is the output.
