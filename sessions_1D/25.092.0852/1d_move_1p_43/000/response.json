The specific non-white color varies between examples (azure, yellow, magenta).\n*   The rest of the sequence consists of white (zero) pixels, located either before, after, or both before and after the non-white block.\n*   Comparing inputs and outputs, the primary transformation involves the position of the non-white block.\n*   In each example, the non-white block appears to shift one position to the right.\n*   The length of the sequence remains constant between the input and the output.\n*   The mechanism for the shift seems to be inserting a white pixel immediately before the start of the non-white block and removing the final pixel of the sequence to maintain the original length.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
