- task_type: array_manipulation
- grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
- elements:
    - type: pixel
      attributes:
        - color: integer (0-9)
        - position: index within the row
- objects:
    - type: contiguous_block
      description: A sequence of one or more adjacent pixels sharing the same non-white color.
      attributes:
        - color: The non-white color of the pixels in the block.
        - length: The number of pixels in the block.
        - start_index: The index of the first pixel in the block.
        - end_index: The index of the last pixel in the block.
      relationships:
        - Surrounded by white pixels (color 0).
      constraints:
        - Exactly one such block exists in the input.
- actions:
    - action: shift_right
      target: contiguous_block
      parameters:
        - amount: 1 position
      effects:
        - The start_index of the block increases by 1.
        - The end_index of the block increases by 1.
        - The pixel at the original start_index becomes white (0).
        - The pixel at the original end_index + 1 takes the color of the block.
- transformation_rule:
    - Find the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
    - Create an output row of the same length, initially all white.
    - Place the non-white block in the output row, shifted one position to the right compared to its input position.
