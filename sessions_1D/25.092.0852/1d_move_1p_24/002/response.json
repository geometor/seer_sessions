            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a contiguous block of non-white pixels one position to the right within a single row. The provided code implements this logic. The errors reported (`The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`) do not stem from a misunderstanding of the transformation rule itself, but likely from how the code interacts with the testing framework, specifically around boolean checks involving NumPy arrays which are commonly used in the framework's backend for grid representation and comparison. The comparison `predicted_output == expected_output` might be generating a boolean array, which then causes issues if used directly in an `if` statement.\n\nThe strategy is to maintain the current understanding of the transformation logic, refine the documentation (YAML facts and natural language program) for clarity, and inform the coder phase about the potential need to handle NumPy array inputs/outputs and comparisons carefully to avoid the ambiguity error.\n\n**Metrics:**\n"
