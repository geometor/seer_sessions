Grid Properties:
  - Type: 1D array (or 1xN grid)
  - Size: Constant between input and output for each example.
Objects:
  - Background:
      - Color: white (0)
      - Location: Surrounds the central object.
  - Central Object:
      - Type: Contiguous block of pixels.
      - Color: Single non-white color (varies per example: magenta, green, gray).
      - Size: Constant between input and output for each example.
      - Count: Exactly one per grid.
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the start and end indices of the non-white central object in the input grid.
  - Shift: Move the central object one position to the right.
Relationships:
  - Position: The starting position of the central object in the output is one index greater than its starting position in the input.
  - Preservation: The color, size, and internal structure of the central object are preserved. The overall grid size is preserved.
