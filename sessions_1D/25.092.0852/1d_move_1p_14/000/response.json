A sequence of zero or more leading white pixels (color 0).\n2.  A single contiguous block of pixels of a single non-white color (e.g., magenta, green, gray).\n3.  A sequence of zero or more trailing white pixels (color 0).\n\nThe output array maintains the same overall length and the same non-white colored block. The transformation involves shifting the non-white block exactly one position to the right. Consequently, the number of leading white pixels increases by one, and the number of trailing white pixels decreases by one.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
