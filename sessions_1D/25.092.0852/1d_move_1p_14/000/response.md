**Perception of the Elements:**

The input and output are both 1D arrays (or 1xN grids).
Each input array consists of three parts:
1.  A sequence of zero or more leading white pixels (color 0).
2.  A single contiguous block of pixels of a single non-white color (e.g., magenta, green, gray).
3.  A sequence of zero or more trailing white pixels (color 0).

The output array maintains the same overall length and the same non-white colored block. The transformation involves shifting the non-white block exactly one position to the right. Consequently, the number of leading white pixels increases by one, and the number of trailing white pixels decreases by one.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid Properties:
  - Type: 1D array (or 1xN grid)
  - Size: Constant between input and output for each example.
Objects:
  - Background:
      - Color: white (0)
      - Location: Surrounds the central object.
  - Central Object:
      - Type: Contiguous block of pixels.
      - Color: Single non-white color (varies per example: magenta, green, gray).
      - Size: Constant between input and output for each example.
      - Count: Exactly one per grid.
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the start and end indices of the non-white central object in the input grid.
  - Shift: Move the central object one position to the right.
Relationships:
  - Position: The starting position of the central object in the output is one index greater than its starting position in the input.
  - Preservation: The color, size, and internal structure of the central object are preserved. The overall grid size is preserved.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input grid. Note its color, starting index, and length.
2.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
3.  Determine the new starting index for the non-white block in the output grid by adding 1 to its starting index in the input grid.
4.  Copy the identified non-white block (preserving its color and length) into the new grid at the calculated new starting index.
5.  The resulting grid is the output.
