**Perception of Elements:**

The task operates on 1-dimensional grids (single rows). Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels (the "object") surrounded by white pixels (the "background"). The transformation involves shifting this object one position to the right within the grid. The size and color of the object can vary, as can its initial position. The grid size remains constant.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Represented as 1xN grids
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    count: 1
    color: non-white (varies: blue, azure, gray in examples)
    properties:
      - length (varies: 4, 5 in examples)
      - position (varies)
actions:
  - type: shift
    target: the non-white block
    direction: right
    magnitude: 1 position
relationships:
  - the non-white block is surrounded by white pixels
constraints:
  - grid size remains constant
  - only one non-white block per grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input grid (a single row of pixels).
2.  Locate the contiguous sequence of non-white pixels within the row. Note its starting position, ending position, and the color(s) of the pixels within it.
3.  Create a new output grid of the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Copy the sequence of non-white pixels identified in step 2 into the output grid, placing it one position to the right of its original location. Specifically, if the block started at index `i` and ended at index `j` in the input, it should start at index `i+1` and end at index `j+1` in the output.
