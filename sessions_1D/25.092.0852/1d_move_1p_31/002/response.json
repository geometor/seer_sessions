The core logic of identifying the non-white block and shifting it one position to the right appears sound based on the visual inspection of the examples, but the implementation failed because it tried to `split` a NumPy array as if it were a string.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Modify the approach to accept a NumPy array as input directly.\n2.  Remove the unnecessary string parsing step (`parse_input_string`).\n3.  Adapt the block finding and manipulation logic to use NumPy array operations and indexing.\n4.  Verify the dimensionality of the input arrays. Although treated as 1D lists previously, they might be 2D arrays (e.g., 5x5 or 1x25). The shifting logic works similarly in either case if flattened or treated row-wise/column-wise, but it's important to confirm.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nLet's examine the type and shape of the input/output data for the first training example."
