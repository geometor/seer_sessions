task_description: Shift a contiguous block of non-white color one step to the right within a 1D NumPy array representing a single row grid.
input_features:
  - type: NumPy array (np.ndarray)
  - shape: (1, N) where N is the number of elements (e.g., (1, 25))
  - contains:
      - white pixels (0)
      - exactly one contiguous block of a single non-white color (C)
output_features:
  - type: NumPy array (np.ndarray)
  - shape: Same as input shape (1, N)
  - contains:
      - the same non-white color block (C) as the input, shifted one position to the right.
      - the position where the block started is now white (0).
objects:
  - id: color_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels within the single row of the input array.
    properties:
      - color: The non-white color C (e.g., 2, 6, 3)
      - start_index: The column index where the block begins in the row.
      - end_index: The column index where the block ends in the row.
    relationships:
      - usually preceded by white pixels (0) or starts at index 0.
      - usually followed by white pixels (0) or ends at the last index N-1.
  - id: background
    description: The pixels that are not part of the color_block.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
transformation:
  - action: Accept the input NumPy array (shape (1, N)).
  - action: Flatten or access the single row of the array for 1D processing.
  - action: Identify the non-white color (C) present in the row.
  - action: Find the indices where the color is C. Determine the start (min index) and end (max index) of the contiguous block.
  - action: Calculate the index immediately following the block (`next_index = end_index + 1`).
  - condition: Ensure `next_index` is within the array bounds ( < N ).
  - result: Create a copy of the input array.
  - action: In the copied array's row, set the element at `start_index` to white (0).
  - action: In the copied array's row, set the element at `next_index` to the non-white color C.
  - output: Return the modified copied array.
