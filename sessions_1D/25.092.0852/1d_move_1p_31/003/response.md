"""
Transforms an input grid (NumPy array of shape (1, N)) by identifying a 
contiguous block of a single non-white color within the row and shifting 
this block one position to the right. The first element of the original 
block becomes white (0), and the element immediately following the original 
block takes on the block's color. If no non-white block is found, or if the 
block is already at the rightmost edge, the original grid is returned.
