Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and describe the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are presented as single strings of space-separated integers. Based on the number of elements (25 in each example), these likely represent flattened 1D arrays or potentially 5x5 grids treated linearly. Given the transformation observed, treating them as 1D lists seems most direct.
2.  **Colors:** Each input contains white pixels (0) and a single block of one other color (red=2, magenta=6, green=3).
3.  **Structure:** In each input, there is a contiguous block of a non-white color surrounded by white pixels (or extending to one end of the list).
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to shift the contiguous block of non-white color one position to the right within the list. The leftmost pixel of the original block becomes white, and the white pixel immediately to the right of the original block takes on the block's color.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a contiguous block of non-white color one step to the right within a 1D list.
input_features:
  - type: 1D list of integers (colors)
  - contains:
      - white pixels (0)
      - exactly one contiguous block of a single non-white color (C)
output_features:
  - type: 1D list of integers (colors)
  - contains:
      - the same non-white color block (C) as the input, shifted one position to the right.
      - the position where the block started is now white (0).
objects:
  - id: color_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The non-white color C (e.g., 2, 6, 3)
      - start_index: The list index where the block begins.
      - end_index: The list index where the block ends.
    relationships:
      - usually preceded by white pixels (0) or starts at index 0.
      - usually followed by white pixels (0) or ends at the last index.
  - id: background
    description: The pixels that are not part of the color_block.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
transformation:
  - action: Identify the non-white color (C) and the start (i) and end (j) indices of its contiguous block in the input list.
  - action: Determine the index immediately following the block (k = j + 1).
  - condition: Assumes index k is within the bounds of the list and input[k] is white (0).
  - result: Create the output list by:
      - Copying the input list.
      - Setting the element at index i to white (0).
      - Setting the element at index k to the non-white color C.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Treat the input as a one-dimensional list of color values.
2.  Identify the single non-white color (let's call it `block_color`) present in the list.
3.  Find the index of the first element in the list that has the `block_color`. Let this be `start_index`.
4.  Find the index of the last element in the list that has the `block_color`. Let this be `end_index`.
5.  Determine the index immediately following the block: `next_index = end_index + 1`.
6.  Create a new list that is initially identical to the input list.
7.  In the new list, change the color of the element at `start_index` to white (0).
8.  In the new list, change the color of the element at `next_index` to `block_color`.
9.  The resulting new list is the output.
