task_description: Shift a contiguous block of non-white color one step to the right within a 1D list.
input_features:
  - type: 1D list of integers (colors)
  - contains:
      - white pixels (0)
      - exactly one contiguous block of a single non-white color (C)
output_features:
  - type: 1D list of integers (colors)
  - contains:
      - the same non-white color block (C) as the input, shifted one position to the right.
      - the position where the block started is now white (0).
objects:
  - id: color_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The non-white color C (e.g., 2, 6, 3)
      - start_index: The list index where the block begins.
      - end_index: The list index where the block ends.
    relationships:
      - usually preceded by white pixels (0) or starts at index 0.
      - usually followed by white pixels (0) or ends at the last index.
  - id: background
    description: The pixels that are not part of the color_block.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
transformation:
  - action: Identify the non-white color (C) and the start (i) and end (j) indices of its contiguous block in the input list.
  - action: Determine the index immediately following the block (k = j + 1).
  - condition: Assumes index k is within the bounds of the list and input[k] is white (0).
  - result: Create the output list by:
      - Copying the input list.
      - Setting the element at index i to white (0).
      - Setting the element at index k to the non-white color C.
