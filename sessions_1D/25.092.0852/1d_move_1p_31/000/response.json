Based on the number of elements (25 in each example), these likely represent flattened 1D arrays or potentially 5x5 grids treated linearly. Given the transformation observed, treating them as 1D lists seems most direct.\n2.  **Colors:** Each input contains white pixels (0) and a single block of one other color (red=2, magenta=6, green=3).\n3.  **Structure:** In each input, there is a contiguous block of a non-white color surrounded by white pixels (or extending to one end of the list).\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to shift the contiguous block of non-white color one position to the right within the list. The leftmost pixel of the original block becomes white, and the white pixel immediately to the right of the original block takes on the block's color.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
