## General Assessment

The previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a single contiguous block of non-background color one step to the right within a 1D grid (represented as a single row in a 2D structure). The natural language program and the initial Python code accurately reflected this understanding.

The error encountered ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...") likely stems not from the core logic of the transformation itself, but from how NumPy arrays are handled, possibly during input processing, output formatting, or comparison within the testing framework. The transformation logic appears sound for the given examples.

**Strategy:**
1.  Verify the input/output data format expected by the function and returned by it (NumPy array vs. list of lists). Adjust the function signature and return type if necessary to align with standard practice or harness expectations (often NumPy arrays for grid manipulation).
2.  Ensure the `find_block` helper function correctly identifies the block's properties (start, end, color).
3.  Refine the `transform` function to explicitly handle the input as a 2D NumPy array, perform the shift on the relevant row, and return the result in the expected format (likely 2D NumPy array).
4.  Gather precise metrics about grid dimensions and block properties using code execution to confirm assumptions.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
Task: Single_Block_Shift_Right
Input_Output_Format:
  Type: Grid
  Dimensionality: 2
  Shape: 1xN (Single row, variable width N)
  Cell_Values: Integers 0-9
  Background_Color: 0 # white
Grid_Objects:
  - Name: Colored_Block
    Identification: A single contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels.
    Properties:
      - Color: Integer 1-9 (constant within a block, varies between examples: 2, 6)
      - Start_Index: Column index of the first pixel of the block.
      - End_Index: Column index of the last pixel of the block.
      - Length: (End_Index - Start_Index + 1), varies between examples (10, 11, 3)
    Relationship_to_Grid: Always appears in the first (only) row, surrounded by Background_Color (0). Only one such block exists per input grid.
Transformation:
  Name: Shift_Block_Right
  Action: Modifies the input grid to produce the output grid.
  Target: The Colored_Block object.
  Rule:
    1. Locate the Colored_Block in the input grid's single row.
    2. Create a copy of the input grid.
    3. In the copied grid's row:
       a. Change the pixel at the block's original Start_Index to the Background_Color (0).
       b. Change the pixel at the index immediately following the block's original End_Index (i.e., End_Index + 1) to the block's Color.
  Constraints:
    - The shift occurs only if there is space to the right (i.e., End_Index + 1 is within the grid bounds). The examples suggest this is always the case.
  Invariant_Properties:
    - Grid dimensions remain unchanged.
    - Block Color remains unchanged.
    - Block Length remains unchanged.
  Changed_Properties:
    - Block Start_Index increases by 1.
    - Block End_Index increases by 1.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input grid, which is expected to be a 2D structure containing a single row.
2.  Identify the single contiguous block (sequence) of non-white pixels within that row. Record its color, starting column index, and ending column index.
3.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
4.  If a block was found and its end index is not the last index of the row:
    a.  Modify the output grid's row: Set the pixel at the block's original starting index to white (0).
    b.  Modify the output grid's row: Set the pixel at the index `original_end_index + 1` to the block's recorded color.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
