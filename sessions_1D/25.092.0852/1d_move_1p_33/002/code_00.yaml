Task: Single_Block_Shift_Right
Input_Output_Format:
  Type: Grid
  Dimensionality: 2
  Shape: 1xN (Single row, variable width N)
  Cell_Values: Integers 0-9
  Background_Color: 0 # white
Grid_Objects:
  - Name: Colored_Block
    Identification: A single contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels.
    Properties:
      - Color: Integer 1-9 (constant within a block, varies between examples: 2, 6)
      - Start_Index: Column index of the first pixel of the block.
      - End_Index: Column index of the last pixel of the block.
      - Length: (End_Index - Start_Index + 1), varies between examples (10, 11, 3)
    Relationship_to_Grid: Always appears in the first (only) row, surrounded by Background_Color (0). Only one such block exists per input grid.
Transformation:
  Name: Shift_Block_Right
  Action: Modifies the input grid to produce the output grid.
  Target: The Colored_Block object.
  Rule:
    1. Locate the Colored_Block in the input grid's single row.
    2. Create a copy of the input grid.
    3. In the copied grid's row:
       a. Change the pixel at the block's original Start_Index to the Background_Color (0).
       b. Change the pixel at the index immediately following the block's original End_Index (i.e., End_Index + 1) to the block's Color.
  Constraints:
    - The shift occurs only if there is space to the right (i.e., End_Index + 1 is within the grid bounds). The examples suggest this is always the case.
  Invariant_Properties:
    - Grid dimensions remain unchanged.
    - Block Color remains unchanged.
    - Block Length remains unchanged.
  Changed_Properties:
    - Block Start_Index increases by 1.
    - Block End_Index increases by 1.
