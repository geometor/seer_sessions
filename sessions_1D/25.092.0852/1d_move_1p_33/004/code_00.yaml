Input_Output_Format:
  Type: 2D Grid (List of Lists)
  Constraints: Examples consistently show grids with exactly one row.
  Pixel_Values: Integers 0-9.
Grid_Properties:
  Dimensionality_Observed: 1xN (Single row, variable columns)
  Background_Color: 0 (white)
Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous_Block
    Definition: A sequence of one or more adjacent pixels in the row with the same non-zero color.
    Quantity: Exactly one per input grid example.
    Properties:
      - Color: Non-zero integer (e.g., 2, 6 in examples). Preserved during transformation.
      - Length: Number of pixels in the block. Preserved during transformation.
      - Position: Defined by start and end column indices within the single row.
    Relationship_to_Grid: Appears within the first (and only) row, surrounded by Background_Color pixels.
Transformation:
  Name: Horizontal_Shift_Right
  Target: The single Contiguous_Block object found in the first row.
  Action: Move the block exactly one position (column) to the right.
  Mechanism:
    - Condition: The shift only occurs if there is at least one Background_Color pixel immediately to the right of the block's original position.
    - Step 1: Change the pixel at the block's original starting column index to the Background_Color (0).
    - Step 2: Change the pixel at the column index immediately following the block's original ending index (i.e., `end_index + 1`) to the block's Color.
  Result: A new grid, identical in shape to the input, where the block is positioned one column further right. If the block is already at the rightmost edge, no change occurs (implied, not explicitly shown in examples).
Assumptions:
  - The transformation logic only applies to the first row of the input grid. Other rows, if present in test cases, are ignored or handled implicitly.
  - Only one non-zero colored block exists in the relevant row.
