"""
Identifies a single contiguous block of a non-white color (non-zero pixel value) 
in a single-row input grid. Shifts this block exactly one position to the right.
The shift is achieved by changing the leftmost pixel of the original block 
to white (0) and changing the white pixel immediately to the right of the block's 
original end position to the block's color. The block's color and length 
are preserved. Assumes input is a 2D grid with only one row.
