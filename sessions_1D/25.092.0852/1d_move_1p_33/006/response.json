Use a.any() or a.all()`. This typically occurs in Python when a boolean context (like an `if` statement) receives a NumPy array containing multiple elements instead of a single boolean value. Reviewing the previous code, the most likely source of this error is the initial check: `if not input_grid or not input_grid[0]:`. If `input_grid` is passed as a NumPy array (e.g., `np.array([[...]])`), then `input_grid[0]` is also a NumPy array (`np.array([...])`). Evaluating `not np.array([...])` raises this ambiguity error.\n\nThe core logic for finding the block (`_find_block_in_row`) and performing the shift appears correct based on the examples. The strategy is to:\n1.  Modify the initial input validation check to be robust against both list-of-lists and NumPy array inputs, likely by using `len()` to check for emptiness instead of direct boolean evaluation of the potential array.\n2.  Verify the block detection logic using `tool_code`.\n3.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program for clarity and precision.\n\n**Metrics**\n"
