"""
Identifies a single contiguous block of a non-zero color in the first row of 
a 2D input grid. Shifts this block exactly one position to the right within 
that row, provided there is space. The shift preserves the block's color 
and length. The transformation modifies a copy of the input grid and returns it.
If no block is found or if the block is already at the rightmost edge, 
the original grid is returned unchanged.
