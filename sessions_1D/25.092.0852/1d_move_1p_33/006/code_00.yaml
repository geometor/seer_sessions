Input_Type: Grid (2D List/Array)
Output_Type: Grid (2D List/Array)
Grid_Properties:
  - Structure: Contains exactly one row of pixels relevant to the transformation.
  - Background_Color: 0 (white)
Objects:
  - Name: Colored_Block
    Identification: A single contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels in the first row.
    Properties:
      - Color: The non-zero integer value of the pixels in the block (constant within a block).
      - Start_Index: The 0-based index of the first pixel of the block.
      - End_Index: The 0-based index of the last pixel of the block.
      - Length: End_Index - Start_Index + 1.
    State_Change: Position shifts. Color and Length remain constant.
Transformation:
  - Name: Shift_Block_Right
    Condition: Applicable only if the Colored_Block exists and its `End_Index + 1` is less than the total width of the row.
    Action:
      1. Copy the input grid to create the output grid.
      2. In the first row of the output grid:
         a. Change the pixel at the `Start_Index` of the original block to the Background_Color (0).
         b. Change the pixel at `End_Index + 1` (the position immediately to the right of the original block) to the block's Color.
    Result: The Colored_Block appears shifted one position to the right in the output grid's first row. Other rows (if any) remain unchanged.
Edge_Cases:
  - No_Block_Found: If no Colored_Block is identified in the first row, the output grid is identical to the input grid.
  - Block_At_Right_Edge: If the block's `End_Index + 1` equals the row width, the shift cannot occur, and the output grid is identical to the input grid.
