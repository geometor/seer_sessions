**Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code failed on all training examples with the error: `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This typically occurs in Python when a boolean context (like an `if` statement) receives a NumPy array containing multiple elements instead of a single boolean value. Reviewing the previous code, the most likely source of this error is the initial check: `if not input_grid or not input_grid[0]:`. If `input_grid` is passed as a NumPy array (e.g., `np.array([[...]])`), then `input_grid[0]` is also a NumPy array (`np.array([...])`). Evaluating `not np.array([...])` raises this ambiguity error.

The core logic for finding the block (`_find_block_in_row`) and performing the shift appears correct based on the examples. The strategy is to:
1.  Modify the initial input validation check to be robust against both list-of-lists and NumPy array inputs, likely by using `len()` to check for emptiness instead of direct boolean evaluation of the potential array.
2.  Verify the block detection logic using `tool_code`.
3.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program for clarity and precision.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Input_Type: Grid (2D List/Array)
Output_Type: Grid (2D List/Array)
Grid_Properties:
  - Structure: Contains exactly one row of pixels relevant to the transformation.
  - Background_Color: 0 (white)
Objects:
  - Name: Colored_Block
    Identification: A single contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels in the first row.
    Properties:
      - Color: The non-zero integer value of the pixels in the block (constant within a block).
      - Start_Index: The 0-based index of the first pixel of the block.
      - End_Index: The 0-based index of the last pixel of the block.
      - Length: End_Index - Start_Index + 1.
    State_Change: Position shifts. Color and Length remain constant.
Transformation:
  - Name: Shift_Block_Right
    Condition: Applicable only if the Colored_Block exists and its `End_Index + 1` is less than the total width of the row.
    Action:
      1. Copy the input grid to create the output grid.
      2. In the first row of the output grid:
         a. Change the pixel at the `Start_Index` of the original block to the Background_Color (0).
         b. Change the pixel at `End_Index + 1` (the position immediately to the right of the original block) to the block's Color.
    Result: The Colored_Block appears shifted one position to the right in the output grid's first row. Other rows (if any) remain unchanged.
Edge_Cases:
  - No_Block_Found: If no Colored_Block is identified in the first row, the output grid is identical to the input grid.
  - Block_At_Right_Edge: If the block's `End_Index + 1` equals the row width, the shift cannot occur, and the output grid is identical to the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid (assumed to be a 2D structure, like a list of lists or a NumPy array).
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Focus on the first row of the grid. Determine its width (number of pixels).
4.  Identify the first contiguous sequence (block) of non-zero pixels within this row. Record its starting index, ending index, and color.
5.  If no such block is found, return the unmodified output grid (copy of the input).
6.  Check if the block can be shifted right: verify that the index immediately following the block's end (`ending index + 1`) is less than the row's width.
7.  If the block can be shifted:
    a.  In the first row of the output grid, set the pixel at the block's original starting index to 0 (background color).
    b.  In the first row of the output grid, set the pixel at the index `ending index + 1` to the block's recorded color.
8.  If the block cannot be shifted (it's already at the rightmost edge), make no changes to the output grid.
9.  Return the final output grid.
