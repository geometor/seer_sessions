Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays) of pixels represented by integers 0-9.
2.  **Background:** The dominant color is white (0), acting as a background.
3.  **Objects:** In each input grid, there is a single contiguous block (segment) of a non-white color (red '2' or magenta '6').
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation observed across all examples is the movement of this colored block. Specifically, the entire block shifts exactly one position to the right.
5.  **Mechanism of Shift:** The shift appears to happen by changing the color of the leftmost pixel of the original block to white (0) and changing the color of the white pixel immediately to the right of the original block to the block's color.
6.  **Consistency:** The color of the block and its length are preserved during the shift. The background remains white.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Dimensionality: 1
  Background_Color: 0 # white
Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous_Block
    Count: 1
    Properties:
      - Color: Any non-zero color (e.g., 2, 6 in examples)
      - Length: Variable (e.g., 10, 11, 3 in examples)
      - Position: Defined by start and end indices within the grid.
    Relationship_to_Grid: Surrounded by Background_Color (0).
Actions:
  - Name: Shift_Right
    Target: The Contiguous_Block object
    Parameters:
      - Distance: 1 pixel
    Mechanism:
      - Change the color of the leftmost pixel of the original block to Background_Color (0).
      - Change the color of the pixel immediately to the right of the original block's rightmost end to the Block's Color.
    Result: The block appears moved one position to the right, maintaining its color and length.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input grid. Determine its color, starting index, and ending index.
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  In the output grid, change the pixel at the starting index of the original block to white (0).
4.  In the output grid, change the pixel at the index immediately following the ending index of the original block (i.e., `end_index + 1`) to the color of the block.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
