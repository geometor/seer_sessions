Specifically, the entire block shifts exactly one position to the right.\n5.  **Mechanism of Shift:** The shift appears to happen by changing the color of the leftmost pixel of the original block to white (0) and changing the color of the white pixel immediately to the right of the original block to the block's color.\n6.  **Consistency:** The color of the block and its length are preserved during the shift. The background remains white.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
