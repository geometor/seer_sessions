Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are single rows (1xN grids).
2.  **Content:** Each input row contains a single contiguous block (segment) of a non-white color (red, orange, magenta in the examples). The rest of the row is filled with the white color (0).
3.  **Transformation:** The output row appears to be the input row with the colored segment shifted one position to the right. The color and length of the segment remain unchanged. The pixel that was originally the leftmost pixel of the segment becomes white in the output, and the pixel immediately to the right of the original segment takes on the segment's color.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
input_characteristics:
  - contains_exactly_one: non_white_contiguous_segment
  - background_color: white (0)
output_characteristics:
  - preserves: dimensions_of_input
  - preserves: color_of_segment_from_input
  - preserves: length_of_segment_from_input
  - changes: position_of_segment_from_input
transformation:
  - action: horizontal_shift
  - object: non_white_contiguous_segment
  - direction: right
  - amount: 1 position
relationship:
  - output_segment is identical to input_segment in color and length
  - start_index_of_output_segment = start_index_of_input_segment + 1
constraints:
  - assumes sufficient space for shift (no wrap-around observed or implied)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid (a single row).
2.  Identify the contiguous segment of non-white pixels within the input row.
3.  Determine the color, length, and starting index of this segment.
4.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with the white color (0).
5.  Place the identified segment (using its original color and length) into the output row, starting at an index that is one greater than its starting index in the input row.
6.  Return the generated output row.
