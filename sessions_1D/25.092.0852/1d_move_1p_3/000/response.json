The rest of the row is filled with the white color (0).\n3.  **Transformation:** The output row appears to be the input row with the colored segment shifted one position to the right. The color and length of the segment remain unchanged. The pixel that was originally the leftmost pixel of the segment becomes white in the output, and the pixel immediately to the right of the original segment takes on the segment's color.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
