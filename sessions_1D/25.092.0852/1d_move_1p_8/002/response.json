            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a contiguous block of non-white pixels one position to the right within a row. However, the implementation failed because it assumed the input was a 1D list, while ARC tasks use 2D NumPy arrays. The error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...\" confirms that the code was trying to evaluate a multi-element array (likely a row from the 2D grid) in a boolean context where a single True/False was expected, stemming from treating the 2D input as 1D.\n\nThe strategy is to adapt the existing logic to work with the 2D NumPy array structure provided by ARC. Since the examples all show transformations occurring within a single row (1xN grid), the core logic of finding and shifting the block within that row remains valid. The code needs to correctly extract the relevant row from the input array, perform the shift, and format the output as a 2D array.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's examine the structure of the inputs and outputs.\n"
