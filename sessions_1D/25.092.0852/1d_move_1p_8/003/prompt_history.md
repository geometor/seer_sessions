**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a 1-dimensional grid (or a 1xN grid) containing a single contiguous block of a non-white color surrounded by white pixels. The transformation consists of shifting this entire block one position to the right, while maintaining its color and size. The grid dimensions remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: non-white (varies per example, e.g., red, azure)
    quantity: 1
    properties:
      - size (length): varies per example
      - position: varies per example
background_color: white (0)
transformation:
  - type: translation
    direction: right
    distance: 1 unit
    target: the single non-white block
properties_preserved:
  - grid_size
  - object_color
  - object_size (length)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input grid. Note its color, starting position, and length.
2.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels.
3.  Place the identified block (with its original color and length) into the new grid, starting at the position one unit to the right of its original starting position.
4.  The resulting grid is the output.

**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a contiguous block of non-white pixels one position to the right within a row. However, the implementation failed because it assumed the input was a 1D list, while ARC tasks use 2D NumPy arrays. The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous..." confirms that the code was trying to evaluate a multi-element array (likely a row from the 2D grid) in a boolean context where a single True/False was expected, stemming from treating the 2D input as 1D.

The strategy is to adapt the existing logic to work with the 2D NumPy array structure provided by ARC. Since the examples all show transformations occurring within a single row (1xN grid), the core logic of finding and shifting the block within that row remains valid. The code needs to correctly extract the relevant row from the input array, perform the shift, and format the output as a 2D array.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Let's examine the structure of the inputs and outputs.

  Output Shape: (1, 9)
  Input Block: Color=2, Start=1, Length=4
  Output Block: Color=2, Start=2, Length=4

  Output Block: Color=8, Start=1, Length=5
  Shift Confirmation: Output Start (1) == Input Start (0) + 1? True

```
**Observations from Metrics:**

1.  **Grid Shape:** All input and output grids are 2D NumPy arrays with shape (1, N), specifically (1, 9) in these examples. This confirms the error source: the code treated a 2D array as 1D.
2.  **Transformation Consistency:** The analysis confirms that in each example, a single contiguous block of a non-white color exists in the input row. This block is shifted exactly one position to the right in the output row. The color and length of the block are preserved. The grid dimensions remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 2D # Input/Output are 2D numpy arrays
grid_shape: (1, N) # Specifically 1 row, variable columns (N=9 in examples)

    location: within the single row
    color: non-white (varies per example: red, azure)
    quantity: 1

      - length: varies per example
      - start_column_index: varies per example
background_color: white (0)
transformation:
  - type: translation
    direction: right (along the row)
    distance: 1 column index
    target: the single non-white block
properties_preserved:

  - object_color
  - object_length
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input grid, which is a 2D NumPy array with a single row (shape 1xN).
2.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input grid.
3.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels within this row. Note its color, starting column index, and length.
4.  Determine the dimensions (number of columns N) of the input row.
5.  Create a new row of length N, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
6.  Calculate the new starting column index for the block by adding 1 to the original starting index.
7.  Place the identified block (with its original color and length) into the new row, starting at the calculated new starting column index. Ensure the placement respects the row boundaries (although examples suggest the shifted block always fits).
8.  Construct the final output grid as a 2D NumPy array containing this single modified row (shape 1xN).
