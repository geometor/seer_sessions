"""
Identifies a single contiguous segment of non-white pixels (value != 0) 
in a 1D input grid (represented as a single row). 
It then shifts this segment exactly one position to the right. 
The color and length of the segment are preserved. 
The background remains white (0). Pixels shifted off the right edge are lost. 
The position vacated by the leftmost pixel of the original segment becomes white.
Assumes input is a list of lists or compatible structure.
