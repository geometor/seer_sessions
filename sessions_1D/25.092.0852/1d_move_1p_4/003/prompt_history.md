*   **Perception:** The task operates on single-row grids (1D arrays). Each input contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color surrounded by white pixels. The transformation involves shifting this colored block one position to the right within the row. The size and color of the block remain unchanged.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous segment of non-white pixels within the input row. Determine its color, its starting column index, and its ending column index.
    2.  Create a new output row with the same length as the input row, initially filled with white pixels (0).
    3.  Copy the identified non-white segment into the output row, placing it starting at (input starting column index + 1) and ending at (input ending column index + 1). Ensure the color is preserved.
    4.  Return the newly created output row.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment:**

The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()" strongly indicates that the code, while attempting to process lists, encountered NumPy arrays at some stage during testing. This usually happens when a boolean condition expects a single True/False value but receives an array of booleans (e.g., comparing a NumPy array element-wise `array == value`). The core logic identified previously (find a contiguous non-white segment and shift it right by one position) appears consistent with all training examples. The failure is likely in the implementation's handling of data types or structures within the testing environment, rather than a misunderstanding of the transformation rule itself. The strategy is to maintain the current understanding of the task's logic but acknowledge that the implementation needs to be robust to the data types used in the execution environment (potentially NumPy arrays).

**Gather Metrics:**

All training examples share the following characteristics:
*   Input and output grids are single rows (1xN dimension).
*   The background color is white (0).
*   Each input contains exactly one contiguous segment (object) of a single non-white color.
*   The non-white color varies between examples: green (3), gray (5), blue (1).
*   The length of the non-white segment varies.
*   The transformation consistently involves shifting the entire non-white segment exactly one position to the right.
*   The color and length of the segment are preserved.
*   The pixel originally occupied by the leftmost pixel of the segment becomes white (0) in the output.
*   The pixel immediately to the right of the original rightmost pixel of the segment takes on the segment's color in the output (unless the segment hits the right boundary).

**Example Analysis:**

*   **Train 1:** Green segment `[3]*16` starting at index 1 shifts to start at index 2.
*   **Train 2:** Gray segment `[5]*4` starting at index 16 shifts to start at index 17.
*   **Train 3:** Blue segment `[1]*4` starting at index 3 shifts to start at index 4.

The error occurring on all examples suggests the issue is fundamental to how the code interacts with the data structure provided by the testing framework, not specific to a particular color, segment length, or position.

**YAML Facts:**

      - size: variable length
      - position: variable start index

  - action: shift_segment
    direction: right

  - action: update_grid
    details: create new grid, fill with background, draw shifted segment
output_features:
  - name: background
    color: white (0)
  - name: object
    property: identical to input object but shifted right by 1 position
relationship: Output grid is the input grid with the non-white segment translated one unit horizontally to the right.
implementation_note: The execution environment might use NumPy arrays. Comparisons or boolean checks need to handle array types correctly (e.g., using `.any()` or `.all()` if appropriate, or ensuring element-wise operations).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels.
2.  Identify the contiguous segment of non-white pixels within the row. Determine its color, its starting column index, and its ending column index. (Assumption: There is exactly one such segment).
3.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).
4.  Calculate the new starting position for the segment by adding 1 to the original starting column index.
5.  Iterate from the new starting position. For the length of the original segment, copy the segment's color into the corresponding positions of the output row, ensuring not to write beyond the row boundaries.
6.  Return the newly created output row, formatted as a grid (a list containing the single output row).
