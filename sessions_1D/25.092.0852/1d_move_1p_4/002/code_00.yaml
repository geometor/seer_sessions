task_type: grid_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Single row
input_features:
  - name: background
    color: white (0)
    property: occupies all cells except the object segment
  - name: object
    property: single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels
    attributes:
      - color: varies (green, gray, blue observed)
      - shape: horizontal line segment
      - size: variable length
      - position: variable start index
transformation:
  - action: find_segment
    target: non-white object
    constraints: exactly one segment exists
    outputs: start_index, end_index, color
  - action: shift_segment
    direction: right
    distance: 1 pixel
    preserves: color, length
  - action: update_grid
    details: create new grid, fill with background, draw shifted segment
output_features:
  - name: background
    color: white (0)
  - name: object
    property: identical to input object but shifted right by 1 position
relationship: Output grid is the input grid with the non-white segment translated one unit horizontally to the right.
implementation_note: The execution environment might use NumPy arrays. Comparisons or boolean checks need to handle array types correctly (e.g., using `.any()` or `.all()` if appropriate, or ensuring element-wise operations).
