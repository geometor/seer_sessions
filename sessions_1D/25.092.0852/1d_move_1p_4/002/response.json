            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" strongly indicates that the code, while attempting to process lists, encountered NumPy arrays at some stage during testing. This usually happens when a boolean condition expects a single True/False value but receives an array of booleans (e.g., comparing a NumPy array element-wise `array == value`). The core logic identified previously (find a contiguous non-white segment and shift it right by one position) appears consistent with all training examples. The failure is likely in the implementation's handling of data types or structures within the testing environment, rather than a misunderstanding of the transformation rule itself. The strategy is to maintain the current understanding of the task's logic but acknowledge that the implementation needs to be robust to the data types used in the execution environment (potentially NumPy arrays).\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nAll training examples share the following characteristics:\n*   Input and output grids are single rows (1xN dimension).\n*   The background color is white (0).\n*   Each input contains exactly one contiguous segment (object) of a single non-white color.\n*   The non-white color varies between examples: green (3), gray (5), blue (1).\n*   The length of the non-white segment varies.\n*   The transformation consistently involves shifting the entire non-white segment exactly one position to the right.\n*   The color and length of the segment are preserved.\n*   The pixel originally occupied by the leftmost pixel of the segment becomes white (0) in the output.\n*   The pixel immediately to the right of the original rightmost pixel of the segment takes on the segment's color in the output (unless the segment hits the right boundary).\n\n**Example Analysis:**\n\n*   **Train 1:** Green segment `[3]*16` starting at index 1 shifts to start at index 2.\n*   **Train 2:** Gray segment `[5]*4` starting at index 16 shifts to start at index 17.\n*   **Train 3:** Blue segment `[1]*4` starting at index 3 shifts to start at index 4.\n\nThe error occurring on all examples suggests the issue is fundamental to how the code interacts with the data structure provided by the testing framework, not specific to a particular color, segment length, or position.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
