task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 2D (but effectively 1D as all examples have height 1)
input_grid_properties:
  - shape: (1, Width) where Width is variable (25 in examples)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - objects:
    - count: 1 per grid
    - definition: A contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels.
    - properties:
        - color: non-white (red, green, yellow seen), consistent within the object
        - length: variable (9, 11, 6 pixels in examples)
        - position: variable start index (9, 7, 9 in examples)
transformation:
  - name: Horizontal Shift
  - target: The single non-white object (segment).
  - action: Translate the object horizontally.
  - parameters:
    - direction: right
    - distance: 1 pixel (cell)
  - constraints: The object does not wrap around the grid boundaries; if shifted off the right edge, it is truncated.
output_grid_properties:
  - shape: Same as input grid (1, Width)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - objects:
    - count: 1 per grid (potentially truncated)
    - definition: Same as input.
    - properties:
        - color: Same as the input object.
        - length: Same as the input object, unless truncated by the right boundary.
        - position: Start index is exactly 1 greater than the input object's start index.
