*   **Perception:** The task involves processing single-row grids (1D arrays). Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels against a white background. The transformation shifts this non-white block exactly one position to the right within the grid. The color of the block, the length of the block, and the size of the grid remain unchanged. The background remains white.

    1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row. Note its color, starting index, and ending index.
    2.  Create an output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled with white pixels (0).
    3.  Copy the identified block of non-white pixels from the input row into the output row, placing it so that its starting index is one greater than its original starting index.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**Assessment:**

The previous code failed due to a type mismatch error ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous..."). This likely occurred because the initial check `if not input_grid or not input_grid[0]:` attempted to evaluate the truthiness of a NumPy array (specifically `input_grid[0]`) when the input `input_grid` was already a NumPy array, rather than the assumed list of lists. The testing framework likely passes NumPy arrays directly. The core logic of identifying the non-white block and shifting it one position to the right seems correct based on the examples, but the implementation needs to correctly handle NumPy array inputs.

**Strategy:**

1.  Modify the function to assume the input `input_grid` is a NumPy array.
2.  Adjust the initial checks for empty or invalid inputs to work correctly with NumPy arrays (e.g., using `.size` or `.shape`).
3.  Ensure the rest of the logic operates correctly on the NumPy row vector.
4.  Verify the output format matches the expected format (likely a NumPy array).
5.  Re-validate the logic against all training examples.

**Metrics:**

Let's gather metrics using code execution to confirm grid dimensions and object properties.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept a 2D input grid (which will have only one row in the provided examples).
2.  Identify the single contiguous horizontal segment (block) of non-white pixels within the row. Determine its color, starting column index, and ending column index.
3.  If no non-white block is found, return a copy of the input grid.
4.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
5.  Calculate the target starting column index for the block in the output grid by adding 1 to the original starting index.
6.  Determine the range of columns to color in the output grid: from the target starting index up to (but not including) the target starting index plus the original block length.
7.  Ensure the target column indices are within the bounds of the grid width.
8.  Fill the calculated range of columns in the output grid's row with the identified block color.
9.  Return the modified output grid.
