The length of the grid is consistent between the input and output in each example (length 9).\n2.  **Pixel Colors:** Each grid contains a block of a single non-white color (blue, orange, red) followed by white (0) pixels.\n3.  **Objects:** The primary object in each input grid is the contiguous block of non-white pixels starting from the leftmost position.\n4.  **Transformation:** In each example, this colored block appears to be shifted one position to the right in the output grid. The position originally occupied by the start of the block becomes white (0), and the overall length of the grid is preserved. The color of the block remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
