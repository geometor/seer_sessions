Okay, let's break down the transformation logic based on the examples provided.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The examples all use 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN grids). The length of the grid is consistent between the input and output in each example (length 9).
2.  **Pixel Colors:** Each grid contains a block of a single non-white color (blue, orange, red) followed by white (0) pixels.
3.  **Objects:** The primary object in each input grid is the contiguous block of non-white pixels starting from the leftmost position.
4.  **Transformation:** In each example, this colored block appears to be shifted one position to the right in the output grid. The position originally occupied by the start of the block becomes white (0), and the overall length of the grid is preserved. The color of the block remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Shift the initial colored block one position to the right.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1
  input_output_size_relation: identical
  width: 9
  height: 1
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    location: starts_at_index_0
    color: non_white
    followed_by: white_pixels
transformation:
  action: shift_right
  target: contiguous_block_starting_at_index_0
  distance: 1_position
  details:
    - Insert a white pixel (0) at the beginning (index 0).
    - Remove the last pixel to maintain the original grid length.
    - The color and length of the shifted block remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid (a single row).
2.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with white (0).
3.  Copy the elements from the input grid, starting from the first element (index 0) up to the second-to-last element (index length-2).
4.  Place these copied elements into the output grid, starting from the second position (index 1).
5.  The first element (index 0) of the output grid remains white (0) (as initialized).
