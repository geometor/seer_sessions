Each input contains a single contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color (blue '1' or red '2'), surrounded by white pixels ('0'). The transformation involves shifting this colored block one position to the right. The length of the block and its color remain the same. The pixel that was originally the leftmost pixel of the block becomes white, and the white pixel immediately to the right of the original block takes on the block's color.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
