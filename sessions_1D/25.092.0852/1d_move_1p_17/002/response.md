*   **General Assessment:**
    The previous code failed because it assumed the input grid was a 1D array/list, while ARC inputs are typically 2D grids (lists of lists), even if they only have one row (1xN). The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" likely arose when NumPy operations were applied to the 2D grid structure where 1D indexing was expected. The core logic of identifying the non-white block and shifting it right seems correct based on the visual examples, but the implementation needs to correctly handle the 2D grid format.

*   **Strategy:**
    1.  Acknowledge the input is a 2D grid (list of lists).
    2.  Modify the code to extract the relevant row (the first and only row in these examples).
    3.  Apply the shifting logic to this extracted 1D row.
    4.  Reconstruct the output as a 2D grid.
    5.  Use `tool_code` to verify the dimensions and the block-finding logic on the actual row data.

*   **Metrics and Verification:**
    Let's verify the input structure and the block finding logic.
    
``` python
    import numpy as np

    # Define inputs as list of lists (1xN grids)
    inputs = [
        [[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],

        [[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ]

                     break

        return start_index, end_index, color

    # Check dimensions and block finding
    for i, grid in enumerate(inputs):

    # Simulate transformation for Example 1

Example 1:
  Input Shape: (1, 16)
  Row: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  Found Block: start=1, end=7, color=1
Example 2:
  Input Shape: (1, 16)
  Row: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  Found Block: start=1, end=8, color=2
Example 3:
  Input Shape: (1, 16)
  Row: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  Found Block: start=1, end=4, color=1

Simulated Transformation (Example 1):
  Input Grid:
[[0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
  Output Grid:
[[0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
  Expected Output:
[[0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
  Matches Expected: True

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: array_manipulation
    dimensionality: 2D (specifically 1xN grids)
    input_features:
      - dimensions: 1 row, variable columns (16 in examples)
      - contains_object: true
        object_description: A single contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color in the first (only) row.
      - background_color: 0 (white)
      - object_color: variable (1=blue or 2=red in examples)
      - object_shape: horizontal segment
      - object_count: 1
      - object_location: Within the single row, surrounded by white pixels.
    output_features:
      - dimensions: Same as input (1xN)
      - contains_object: true
        object_description: Same object as input, shifted horizontally.
      - background_color: 0 (white)
      - object_color: Same as input object color.
      - object_shape: horizontal segment (same length as input object)
      - object_count: 1
      - object_location: Shifted one column to the right compared to the input object.
    transformation:
      - type: translation
      - axis: horizontal
      - distance: 1 pixel
      - direction: right
      - description: The single non-white block within the row is shifted one position to the right.
      - details:
        - Consider the input as a 1xN grid.
        - Identify the contiguous block of non-white color C in the row.
        - Let its starting column index be 'start_col' and ending column index be 'end_col'.
        - Create an output grid of the same dimensions, initially a copy of the input.
        - In the output grid's row, set the pixel at column 'start_col' to white (0).
        - In the output grid's row, set the pixel at column 'end_col + 1' to color C.
        - All other pixels retain their original color.
    relationships:
      - The non-white block is always surrounded by white pixels in the input examples, allowing space for the shift.
      - The length and color of the block are preserved.
      - The grid dimensions remain constant.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input as a 2D grid (which will have 1 row and N columns).
    2.  Extract the first (and only) row from the grid.
    3.  Identify the single contiguous sequence (block) of non-white pixels within this row. Determine its color (`C`), starting column index (`start_col`), and ending column index (`end_col`).
    4.  Create a new 2D grid (the output grid) that is an exact copy of the input grid.
    5.  Modify the first row of the output grid:
        a.  Change the pixel value at column index `start_col` to white (0).
        b.  Change the pixel value at column index `end_col + 1` to the identified color `C`. (Ensure this index is within the bounds of the row).
    6.  Return the modified output grid.
