            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The previous code failed because it assumed the input grid was a 1D array/list, while ARC inputs are typically 2D grids (lists of lists), even if they only have one row (1xN). The error \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" likely arose when NumPy operations were applied to the 2D grid structure where 1D indexing was expected. The core logic of identifying the non-white block and shifting it right seems correct based on the visual examples, but the implementation needs to correctly handle the 2D grid format.\n\n*   **Strategy:**\n    1.  Acknowledge the input is a 2D grid (list of lists).\n    2.  Modify the code to extract the relevant row (the first and only row in these examples).\n    3.  Apply the shifting logic to this extracted 1D row.\n    4.  Reconstruct the output as a 2D grid.\n    5.  Use `tool_code` to verify the dimensions and the block-finding logic on the actual row data.\n\n*   **Metrics and Verification:**\n    Let's verify the input structure and the block finding logic.\n    "
