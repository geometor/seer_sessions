*   **Perception:**
    The input and output are single rows of pixels. Each input contains a single contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color (blue '1' or red '2'), surrounded by white pixels ('0'). The transformation involves shifting this colored block one position to the right. The length of the block and its color remain the same. The pixel that was originally the leftmost pixel of the block becomes white, and the white pixel immediately to the right of the original block takes on the block's color.

      - The non-white block is always surrounded by white pixels in the input.
      - The length and color of the block are preserved in the output.
      - The grid size remains constant.

    2.  Create a new row of the same size as the input, initially filled with the same pixel values as the input row.
    3.  Change the pixel value at `start_index` in the new row to white (0).

## Example 3:

*   **General Assessment:**
    The previous code failed because it assumed the input grid was a 1D array/list, while ARC inputs are typically 2D grids (lists of lists), even if they only have one row (1xN). The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" likely arose when NumPy operations were applied to the 2D grid structure where 1D indexing was expected. The core logic of identifying the non-white block and shifting it right seems correct based on the visual examples, but the implementation needs to correctly handle the 2D grid format.

*   **Strategy:**
    1.  Acknowledge the input is a 2D grid (list of lists).
    2.  Modify the code to extract the relevant row (the first and only row in these examples).
    3.  Apply the shifting logic to this extracted 1D row.
    4.  Reconstruct the output as a 2D grid.
    5.  Use `tool_code` to verify the dimensions and the block-finding logic on the actual row data.

*   **Metrics and Verification:**
    Let's verify the input structure and the block finding logic.
