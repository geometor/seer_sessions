task_description: Shift a single contiguous colored segment one position to the right within a single-row 2D grid.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  height: 1
  width: variable (e.g., 23 in examples)
  input_output_size_match: true
objects:
  - type: segment
    count: 1 (per grid)
    location: Resides entirely within the single row (row 0).
    description: A single contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      color: Any non-white color (e.g., magenta, yellow, red)
      length: Variable
      vertical_position: row 0
    background: white (0) pixels surround the segment horizontally within the row.
transformation:
  type: horizontal_shift
  action: Translate the identified segment horizontally within its row.
  details:
    target: The non-white segment in row 0.
    direction: right
    distance: 1 pixel (1 column)
    preserves_color: true
    preserves_length: true
    preserves_row_position: true # Stays in row 0
  effect_on_background: White pixels fill the space vacated by the shift and remain elsewhere in the row. The grid dimensions remain unchanged.
