Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The inputs and outputs are single rows (1-dimensional arrays) of pixels.
2.  **Content:** Each input row consists predominantly of white (0) pixels, with a single contiguous segment of non-white pixels (magenta (6) in `train_1`, yellow (4) in `train_2`, red (2) in `train_3`).
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation observed across all examples is a positional shift of the non-white segment.
4.  **Shift Details:** The non-white segment in the output appears in the same color and length as in the input, but its starting position is shifted one index to the right compared to the input. The surrounding white pixels adjust accordingly.
5.  **Consistency:** The length of the row remains the same from input to output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a single contiguous colored segment one position to the right within a 1D array.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D
  input_output_size_match: true
objects:
  - type: segment
    count: 1
    description: A single contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      color: Any non-white color (e.g., magenta, yellow, red)
      length: Variable
    background: white (0) pixels surround the segment.
transformation:
  type: shift
  action: Translate the identified segment horizontally.
  details:
    target: The non-white segment.
    direction: right
    distance: 1 pixel
    preserves_color: true
    preserves_length: true
  effect_on_background: White pixels fill the space vacated by the shift and remain elsewhere.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous segment of non-white pixels within the input row. Determine its color, starting index, and ending index.
2.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
3.  Copy the identified non-white segment (preserving its color and length) into the output row, starting at an index one greater than its original starting index.
