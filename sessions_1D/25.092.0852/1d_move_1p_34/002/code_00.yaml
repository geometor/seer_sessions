task_type: object_translation
grid_properties:
  - type: single_row_numpy_array # Updated to specify NumPy array
  - size_invariant: true
objects:
  - id: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels within the single row numpy array.
    properties:
      - color: preserved between input and output (magenta, red, azure in examples)
      - length: preserved between input and output
    count: 1 per grid
background:
  - id: background_pixels
    description: Pixels with value 0 (white).
    properties:
      - surrounds the colored_block
actions:
  - name: translate_right
    target: colored_block
    details: Shift the entire colored_block one position to the right within the row.
relationships:
  - type: position_change
    object: colored_block
    attribute: start_column_index
    change: input_start_index + 1 = output_start_index
constraints:
  - The grid dimensions (shape) remain constant.
  - The color and length of the colored_block remain constant.
  - The translation is exactly one step to the right.
  - Input is guaranteed to be a NumPy array.
