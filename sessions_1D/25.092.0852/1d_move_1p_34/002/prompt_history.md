Okay, analyzing the examples provided:

**Perception of the Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are single-row grids (1D arrays).
*   Each input grid contains a contiguous block (object) of a single non-white color (magenta, red, or azure) surrounded by white pixels (0).
*   The output grid also contains the same block of non-white pixels, identical in color and length to the input block.
*   The primary difference between the input and output is the position of this non-white block.
*   In each example, the non-white block in the output grid is shifted one position to the right compared to its position in the input grid.
*   The overall size of the grid remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_translation
grid_properties:
  - type: single_row
  - size_invariant: true
objects:
  - id: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: preserved between input and output (magenta, red, azure in examples)
      - length: preserved between input and output
    count: 1 per grid
background:
  - id: background_pixels
    description: Pixels with value 0 (white).
    properties:
      - surrounds the colored_block
actions:
  - name: translate_right
    target: colored_block
    details: Shift the entire colored_block one position to the right.
relationships:
  - type: position_change
    object: colored_block
    attribute: start_index
    change: input_start_index + 1 = output_start_index
constraints:
  - The grid dimensions remain constant.
  - The color and length of the colored_block remain constant.
  - The translation is exactly one step to the right.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input row. Note its color, length, and starting position.
2.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled with white pixels (0).
3.  Place the identified block of non-white pixels into the output row, starting one position to the right of its original starting position in the input row.
```python
import copy

"""
Transformation Rule:
Identify the first contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels in the input grid (which is always a single row). 
Create an output grid of the same dimensions, initially filled with white pixels.
Place the identified block into the output grid, shifted one position to the right compared to its original starting position.
