Okay, analyzing the examples provided:

**Perception of the Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are single-row grids (1D arrays).
*   Each input grid contains a contiguous block (object) of a single non-white color (magenta, red, or azure) surrounded by white pixels (0).
*   The output grid also contains the same block of non-white pixels, identical in color and length to the input block.
*   The primary difference between the input and output is the position of this non-white block.
*   In each example, the non-white block in the output grid is shifted one position to the right compared to its position in the input grid.
*   The overall size of the grid remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_translation
grid_properties:
  - type: single_row
  - size_invariant: true
objects:
  - id: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: preserved between input and output (magenta, red, azure in examples)
      - length: preserved between input and output
    count: 1 per grid
background:
  - id: background_pixels
    description: Pixels with value 0 (white).
    properties:
      - surrounds the colored_block
actions:
  - name: translate_right
    target: colored_block
    details: Shift the entire colored_block one position to the right.
relationships:
  - type: position_change
    object: colored_block
    attribute: start_index
    change: input_start_index + 1 = output_start_index
constraints:
  - The grid dimensions remain constant.
  - The color and length of the colored_block remain constant.
  - The translation is exactly one step to the right.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input row. Note its color, length, and starting position.
2.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled with white pixels (0).
3.  Place the identified block of non-white pixels into the output row, starting one position to the right of its original starting position in the input row.
