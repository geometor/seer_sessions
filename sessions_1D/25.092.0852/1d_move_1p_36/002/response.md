*   **General Assessment**:
    *   The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a contiguous block of non-white pixels one step to the right within a sequence.
    *   The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" clearly indicates that the input data, assumed to be 1D lists, is actually being processed as multi-dimensional arrays (likely NumPy arrays), probably 2D grids, even if they only have one row in the examples.
    *   The previous code attempted to iterate directly over a potentially 2D structure as if it were 1D, causing comparisons between arrays and integers.
    *   The strategy needs refinement to explicitly handle 2D grids, applying the identified 1D transformation logic to each row independently.

*   **Metrics**:
    *   All training inputs appear to be 1x15 grids (1 row, 15 columns).

```
*   **Observations from Metrics**:
    *   Inputs and outputs consistently have the same shape (1x15).
    *   The number of non-white pixels remains constant between input and output.
    *   Each input contains only white (0) and one other color.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_manipulation
    data_representation: 2D_grid_of_colors
    grid_properties:
      - shape_constant: true # Input and output grids have the same dimensions
      - background_color: 0 # white
    row_processing: independent # Transformation is applied row by row
    objects_per_row:
      - type: contiguous_block
        color: non-white (variable, e.g., 2, 1, 5)
        count: 1 # Assumed one block per row based on examples
        properties:
          - single_color_within_block
          - surrounded_by_background_color (at least on the right within the row)
    actions_per_row:
      - identify_object: locate the start and end column indices of the non-white block in the row
      - shift_object: move the block one position to the right within the row
      - update_pixels:
          - change the pixel at the start column index of the original block position to the background color (0)
          - change the pixel at the column index immediately following the end column index of the block to the block's color
    constraints:
      - each row contains at most one non-white block
      - the block has space to shift right within the row boundaries
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
    3.  For the current row:
        a.  Identify the contiguous sequence (block) of non-white pixels. If no such block exists, copy the row directly to the corresponding row in the output grid and proceed to the next row.
        b.  Note the color of this block and its start and end column indices.
        c.  Create a copy of the current input row to serve as the current output row.
        d.  Change the pixel at the start column index of the identified block in the current output row to white (0).
        e.  Change the pixel at the column index immediately following the end column index of the block in the current output row to the color noted in step 3b. (Ensure this index is within the row bounds).
        f.  Place this modified row into the corresponding row position in the output grid.
    4.  Return the completed output grid.
