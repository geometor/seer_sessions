*   **Perception**:
    *   The input and output data are presented as 1D arrays (or flattened 2D grids) of integers representing colors.
    *   Each input array contains a single contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels, surrounded by white (zero) pixels.
    *   The non-white block consists of pixels of the same color (e.g., all red, all blue, all gray).
    *   In the output, this block of non-white pixels appears shifted one position to the right compared to its position in the input.
    *   The leftmost pixel of the original block becomes white (0).
    *   The white (0) pixel immediately to the right of the original block takes on the color of the block.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
*   **General Assessment**:
    *   The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a contiguous block of non-white pixels one step to the right within a sequence.
    *   The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" clearly indicates that the input data, assumed to be 1D lists, is actually being processed as multi-dimensional arrays (likely NumPy arrays), probably 2D grids, even if they only have one row in the examples.
    *   The previous code attempted to iterate directly over a potentially 2D structure as if it were 1D, causing comparisons between arrays and integers.
    *   The strategy needs refinement to explicitly handle 2D grids, applying the identified 1D transformation logic to each row independently.

*   **Metrics**:
    *   All training inputs appear to be 1x15 grids (1 row, 15 columns).
