*   **Perception:** The input consists of a single row (a 1D array) containing mostly white pixels (0) and a single contiguous block of non-white pixels of a specific color (magenta or red in the examples). The output is a row of the same size where the non-white block has been shifted one position to the right. The background remains white.

    1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input array. Note its color, starting index, and ending index.
    2.  Create a new output array of the same size as the input array, initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).
    3.  Determine the new starting index for the block by adding 1 to the original starting index.
    4.  Copy the sequence of non-white pixels from the identified block in the input array into the output array, starting at the new calculated index.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment

The previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed the input was a 1D list, while ARC tasks always use 2D grids (represented as lists of lists or 2D NumPy arrays). When the code attempted to iterate through the input grid and compare elements using `pixel != 0`, `pixel` was actually an entire row (a 1D array), leading to the NumPy error `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...`.

The strategy for resolution is to modify the code to correctly handle the 2D structure of ARC grids:
1.  Acknowledge that the input `input_grid` is a 2D structure (e.g., `[[...]]`).
2.  Extract the relevant 1D sequence (the first row in this case, as all examples have only one row).
3.  Apply the block-finding and shifting logic to this 1D sequence.
4.  Construct the output as a 2D grid of the same dimensions as the input, placing the transformed 1D sequence into the corresponding row (the first row).

## Metrics Gathering

Let's confirm the structure and properties of the input/output pairs.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept a 2D input grid. Assume the grid has at least one row.
2.  Identify the first row of the input grid.
3.  Locate the single contiguous block of non-white pixels within this row. Record its color, start column index, and end column index. If no such block exists, the output is identical to the input.
4.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
5.  Calculate the new start column index for the block by adding 1 to the original start column index.
6.  Calculate the new end column index for the block by adding 1 to the original end column index.
7.  Iterate from the original start column index to the original end column index (inclusive). For each index `i` in this range:
    *   Calculate the corresponding target column index in the output grid: `target_col = i + 1`.
    *   If `target_col` is within the bounds of the grid's width, copy the color of the pixel at `input_grid[0][i]` (which is the block's color) to the output grid at `output_grid[0][target_col]`.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
