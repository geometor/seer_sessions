task_type: grid_transformation
dimensionality: 2D
input_characteristics:
  shape: (1, N) where N is variable (12 in examples)
  grid_content:
    - background_color: white (0)
    - objects:
        - type: contiguous_block
          count: 1
          location: within the single row
          color: non-white (variable, e.g., magenta (6), red (2))
          orientation: horizontal
output_characteristics:
  shape: same as input (1, N)
  grid_content:
    - background_color: white (0)
    - objects:
        - type: contiguous_block
          count: 1
          location: within the single row
          color: same as input object color
          orientation: horizontal
          position: shifted one unit right relative to input position
transformation:
  action: shift
  target: non-white_contiguous_block in the first row
  direction: right
  distance: 1 unit (column index increases by 1)
  constraints:
    - shift is contained within the grid boundaries (no wrap-around)
    - pixels shifted "off" the right edge are lost
    - the position vacated by the leftmost pixel of the block becomes white (0)
  background_handling: maintain background color (white)
