Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

The input is always a single row (1D grid) containing a sequence of white pixels (0) and a single contiguous block of non-white pixels of a specific color (yellow, azure, or blue in the examples). The output is the same row, but the contiguous block of non-white pixels has been shifted exactly one position to the right. The pixel that was previously occupied by the leftmost pixel of the block becomes white, and the pixel immediately to the right of the block's original rightmost position takes on the block's color. The size and color of the block remain unchanged.

    Output:
      grid: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    Objects:
      - type: background
        color: white
        location: occupies most cells
      - type: block
        color: blue
        location: contiguous segment starting at index 6, length 6
    Action:
      - type: shift
        object: block
        direction: right
        distance: 1 position
        result: block starts at index 7

Generalization:
  - Input consists of a 1D grid (row).
  - The grid contains predominantly white pixels (0) and one contiguous block of non-white pixels.
  - The transformation involves shifting this non-white block one position to the right.
  - The background color remains white.
  - The color and size of the block remain unchanged.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input row. Note its color, starting position (index), and length.
2.  Create a new row of the same length as the input row, initially filled with white pixels (0).
3.  Place the identified block (same color, same length) into the new row, starting at the original starting position plus one.
