Examples:
  - Input:
      grid: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    Output:
      grid: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]]
    Objects:
      - type: background
        color: white
        location: occupies most cells
      - type: block
        color: yellow
        location: contiguous segment starting at index 14, length 3
    Action:
      - type: shift
        object: block
        direction: right
        distance: 1 position
        result: block starts at index 15

  - Input:
      grid: [[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    Output:
      grid: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    Objects:
      - type: background
        color: white
        location: occupies most cells
      - type: block
        color: azure
        location: contiguous segment starting at index 3, length 5
    Action:
      - type: shift
        object: block
        direction: right
        distance: 1 position
        result: block starts at index 4

  - Input:
      grid: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    Output:
      grid: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    Objects:
      - type: background
        color: white
        location: occupies most cells
      - type: block
        color: blue
        location: contiguous segment starting at index 6, length 6
    Action:
      - type: shift
        object: block
        direction: right
        distance: 1 position
        result: block starts at index 7

Generalization:
  - Input consists of a 1D grid (row).
  - The grid contains predominantly white pixels (0) and one contiguous block of non-white pixels.
  - The transformation involves shifting this non-white block one position to the right.
  - The background color remains white.
  - The color and size of the block remain unchanged.
