The output is the same row, but the contiguous block of non-white pixels has been shifted exactly one position to the right. The pixel that was previously occupied by the leftmost pixel of the block becomes white, and the pixel immediately to the right of the block's original rightmost position takes on the block's color. The size and color of the block remain unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
