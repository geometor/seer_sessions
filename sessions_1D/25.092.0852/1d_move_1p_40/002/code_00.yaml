task_type: array_transformation
dimensionality: 1D
grid_properties:
  height: 1
  variable_width: true
objects:
  - type: segment
    description: A single, contiguous horizontal sequence of a single non-white color, surrounded by white (0) pixels or grid boundaries.
    color: variable (changes per example, e.g., blue, green, azure)
    location: Defined by a start and end index within the row.
    length: variable.
    attributes:
      - start_index: integer >= 0
      - end_index: integer >= start_index
      - length: integer > 0 (end_index - start_index + 1)
      - color_value: integer 1-9
surrounding_color: white (0)
transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift
  target: The entire non-white segment.
  direction: right
  distance: 1 pixel
  effect:
    - Identify the non-white segment (start index, end index, color).
    - If no segment exists, the output is identical to the input.
    - If a segment exists:
        - The pixel at the segment's original start index becomes white (0).
        - The segment's pixels are placed starting one position to the right of the original start index.
        - Specifically, for each original index `i` from `start_index` to `end_index`, the pixel at `i + 1` in the output grid takes the segment's color, provided `i + 1` is within the grid bounds.
constraints:
  - The grid is always 1 row high.
  - The grid contains at most one contiguous segment of a non-white color.
derived_metrics: # From code execution
  - The length of the segment remains constant between input and output.
  - The color of the segment remains constant between input and output.
  - The start index of the segment always increases by exactly 1 from input to output.
