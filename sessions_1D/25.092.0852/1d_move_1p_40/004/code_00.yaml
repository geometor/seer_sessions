    description: A single contiguous sequence of a single non-white color (color > 0) surrounded by white pixels (color 0) or grid boundaries.
    attributes:
      color: The color of the segment's pixels (variable, e.g., 1, 3, 8).
      start_index: The 0-based index of the leftmost pixel of the segment.
      end_index: The 0-based index of the rightmost pixel of the segment.
      length: The number of pixels in the segment (end_index - start_index + 1).

  action: modify_pixels_based_on_segment
  description: Alters two specific pixels based on the properties of the non-white segment found in the input.
  steps:
    1. Identify the non-white segment in the input row (find its start_index 's', end_index 'e', and color 'c').
    2. Create the output row as a copy of the input row.
    3. Change the pixel at index 's' in the output row to white (0).
    4. If the index 'e + 1' is within the bounds of the row width, change the pixel at index 'e + 1' in the output row to the segment's color 'c'.
  effect: The net effect is equivalent to shifting the entire segment one position to the right, leaving the original start position white and filling the position after the original end position with the segment's color. Pixels outside these two modified positions remain unchanged from the input.
constraints:
  - Input grid is always 1 row high.
  - Input grid contains exactly one contiguous segment of a single non-white color, or is entirely white. (Implicit: If all white, output equals input).
