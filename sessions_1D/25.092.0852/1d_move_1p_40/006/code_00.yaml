objects:
  - type: segment
    description: A single contiguous horizontal sequence of a single non-white color, bounded by white pixels or grid edges.
    color: variable (value > 0)
    properties:
      start_index: The column index of the leftmost pixel of the segment.
      end_index: The column index of the rightmost pixel of the segment.
      segment_color: The color value (1-9) of the pixels in the segment.
transformation:
  action: modify_segment_boundaries_for_shift
  description: Simulates shifting the non-white segment one position to the right by modifying the pixel at the start of the segment and the pixel immediately following the end of the segment.
  steps:
    1. Create a copy of the input grid row.
    2. Find the `start_index`, `end_index`, and `segment_color` of the single non-white segment in the input row.
    3. If no such segment exists (row is all white), return the unmodified copy.
    4. In the copied row, set the pixel value at `start_index` to white (0).
    5. Calculate the target index for the shifted color: `target_index = end_index + 1`.
    6. Check if `target_index` is within the valid column indices of the row (i.e., `target_index < width`).
    7. If `target_index` is within bounds, set the pixel value at `target_index` in the copied row to `segment_color`.
    8. Return the modified copied row (formatted as a 1-row grid).
constraints:
  - Input grid has exactly one row.
  - Input grid contains at most one contiguous segment of a non-white color.
