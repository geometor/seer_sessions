**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: finding a contiguous segment of non-white color and effectively shifting it one position to the right. The error encountered during testing ("ValueError: The truth value of an array...") was not due to faulty logic but rather a technical issue in the Python code's handling of input types, specifically when applying boolean checks to NumPy arrays which might be used internally by the testing framework. The simulation performed using `tool_code` confirms that the derived logic correctly transforms all training examples.

**Strategy:**

The primary strategy is to correct the input handling/validation within the Python function to avoid the ambiguity error. The core transformation logic, as confirmed by simulation, appears sound and does not require alteration based on the provided examples. The YAML facts and natural language program will be updated for maximum clarity and precision based on the confirmed logic.

**Metrics & Observations:**

| Example | Input Length | Segment Color | Segment Start Index | Segment End Index | Output Matches Simulation | Key Changes (Input -> Output)                   |
| :------ | :----------- | :------------ | :------------------ | :---------------- | :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | 22           | 1 (blue)      | 0                   | 16                | True                      | Index 0: 1 -> 0; Index 17: 0 -> 1             |
| 2       | 22           | 3 (green)     | 0                   | 15                | True                      | Index 0: 3 -> 0; Index 16: 0 -> 3             |
| 3       | 22           | 8 (azure)     | 1                   | 12                | True                      | Index 1: 8 -> 0; Index 13: 0 -> 8             |

*   **Consistency:** All inputs are 1x22 grids.
*   **Object:** Each input contains exactly one continuous horizontal segment of a single non-white color.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation consistently involves making the *first* pixel of the identified segment white (0) and making the pixel *immediately following* the *last* pixel of the segment take on the segment's original color. This simulates a rightward shift.
*   **Boundaries:** The transformation correctly handles cases where the segment starts at index 0 and cases where it starts later. It also implicitly handles the case where the segment ends at the second-to-last pixel (index `width - 2`), allowing the color to move into the last pixel (index `width - 1`). If the segment ended at the last pixel, the color would shift "off" the grid, which is handled by the bounds check.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation
dimensionality: 1D
grid_properties:
  height: 1
  width: variable # Although 22 in examples, assuming variability is possible
objects:
  - type: segment
    description: A single contiguous horizontal sequence of a single non-white color, bounded by white pixels or grid edges.
    color: variable (value > 0)
    properties:
      start_index: The column index of the leftmost pixel of the segment.
      end_index: The column index of the rightmost pixel of the segment.
      segment_color: The color value (1-9) of the pixels in the segment.
transformation:
  action: modify_segment_boundaries_for_shift
  description: Simulates shifting the non-white segment one position to the right by modifying the pixel at the start of the segment and the pixel immediately following the end of the segment.
  steps:
    1. Create a copy of the input grid row.
    2. Find the `start_index`, `end_index`, and `segment_color` of the single non-white segment in the input row.
    3. If no such segment exists (row is all white), return the unmodified copy.
    4. In the copied row, set the pixel value at `start_index` to white (0).
    5. Calculate the target index for the shifted color: `target_index = end_index + 1`.
    6. Check if `target_index` is within the valid column indices of the row (i.e., `target_index < width`).
    7. If `target_index` is within bounds, set the pixel value at `target_index` in the copied row to `segment_color`.
    8. Return the modified copied row (formatted as a 1-row grid).
constraints:
  - Input grid has exactly one row.
  - Input grid contains at most one contiguous segment of a non-white color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels.
2.  Make an exact copy of this input row. This copy will be modified to become the output row.
3.  Examine the input row to locate the first contiguous segment of pixels with a color other than white (0). Identify its starting column index (`start_index`), its ending column index (`end_index`), and its color (`segment_color`).
4.  If no non-white segment is found in the input row, return the unmodified copy.
5.  Modify the copied row:
    a.  Change the color of the pixel at the `start_index` to white (0).
    b.  Determine the column index immediately following the end of the segment: `target_index = end_index + 1`.
    c.  Check if this `target_index` exists within the row (i.e., it is less than the row's width).
    d.  If the `target_index` is valid, change the color of the pixel at this `target_index` to the `segment_color`.
6.  Return the fully modified copied row, presented as a single-row grid.
