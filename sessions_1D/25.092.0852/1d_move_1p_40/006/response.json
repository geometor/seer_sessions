            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: finding a contiguous segment of non-white color and effectively shifting it one position to the right. The error encountered during testing (\"ValueError: The truth value of an array...\") was not due to faulty logic but rather a technical issue in the Python code's handling of input types, specifically when applying boolean checks to NumPy arrays which might be used internally by the testing framework. The simulation performed using `tool_code` confirms that the derived logic correctly transforms all training examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe primary strategy is to correct the input handling/validation within the Python function to avoid the ambiguity error. The core transformation logic, as confirmed by simulation, appears sound and does not require alteration based on the provided examples. The YAML facts and natural language program will be updated for maximum clarity and precision based on the confirmed logic.\n\n**Metrics & Observations:**\n\n| Example | Input Length | Segment Color | Segment Start Index | Segment End Index | Output Matches Simulation | Key Changes (Input -> Output)                   |\n| :------ | :----------- | :------------ | :------------------ | :---------------- | :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | 22           | 1 (blue)      | 0                   | 16                | True                      | Index 0: 1 -> 0; Index 17: 0 -> 1             |\n| 2       | 22           | 3 (green)     | 0                   | 15                | True                      | Index 0: 3 -> 0; Index 16: 0 -> 3             |\n| 3       | 22           | 8 (azure)     | 1                   | 12                | True                      | Index 1: 8 -> 0; Index 13: 0 -> 8             |\n\n*   **Consistency:** All inputs are 1x22 grids.\n*   **Object:** Each input contains exactly one continuous horizontal segment of a single non-white color.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation consistently involves making the *first* pixel of the identified segment white (0) and making the pixel *immediately following* the *last* pixel of the segment take on the segment's original color. This simulates a rightward shift.\n*   **Boundaries:** The transformation correctly handles cases where the segment starts at index 0 and cases where it starts later. It also implicitly handles the case where the segment ends at the second-to-last pixel (index `width - 2`), allowing the color to move into the last pixel (index `width - 1`). If the segment ended at the last pixel, the color would shift \"off\" the grid, which is handled by the bounds check.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
