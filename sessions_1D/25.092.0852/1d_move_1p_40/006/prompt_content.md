"""
Transforms the input grid by finding the first contiguous non-white segment 
in the single row and modifying two pixels: the original starting position 
of the segment becomes white (0), and the position immediately following 
the original end of the segment becomes the segment's color (if within 
grid bounds). This effectively shifts the segment one position to the right.
