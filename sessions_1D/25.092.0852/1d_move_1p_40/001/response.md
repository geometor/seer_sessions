    Finds the index and color of the first non-white pixel in a grid row.

    Args:

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing (index, color) of the first non-white pixel,

    Transforms the input grid by finding the first non-white pixel from the left
    in the single row, changing its original position to white (0), and changing
    the pixel immediately to its right to the original color of the first non-white
    pixel. If the first non-white pixel is at the rightmost edge, it simply
