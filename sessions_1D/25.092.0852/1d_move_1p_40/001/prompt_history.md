Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are single-row grids (1D arrays).
2.  **Colors:** Each example uses white (0) and one other distinct color (blue=1, green=3, azure=8).
3.  **Objects:** The primary object is a contiguous horizontal segment of the non-white color. This segment is surrounded by white pixels, potentially only on one side if it starts or ends at the grid boundary.
4.  **Transformation:** In all examples, the non-white segment appears to be shifted one position to the right. The position originally occupied by the leftmost pixel of the non-white segment becomes white in the output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation
dimensionality: 1D
grid_properties:
  height: 1
  variable_width: true
objects:
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of a single non-white color.
    color: variable (changes per example, e.g., blue, green, azure)
    location: variable start index in the row.
    surrounding_color: white (0)
transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift
  direction: right
  distance: 1 pixel
  target: The first non-white pixel encountered from the left.
  effect:
    - The first non-white pixel is moved one position to the right.
    - The original position of that first non-white pixel becomes white (0).
    - All pixels to the right of the original first non-white pixel are also shifted one position to the right.
    - Pixels to the left of the original first non-white pixel remain unchanged.
constraints:
  - The grid always contains exactly one contiguous segment of a non-white color.
  - The grid is always 1 row high.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the same values as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid from left to right (index 0 upwards).
3.  Find the index of the *first* pixel that is not white (value is not 0). Let this index be `first_non_white_index`.
4.  If no non-white pixel is found (the grid is all white), the output is identical to the input; stop.
5.  If `first_non_white_index` is found:
    a.  Set the pixel at `first_non_white_index` in the *output* grid to white (0).
    b.  Set the pixel at `first_non_white_index + 1` in the *output* grid to the color value found at `first_non_white_index` in the *input* grid.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
