task_type: array_transformation
dimensionality: 1D
grid_properties:
  height: 1
  variable_width: true
objects:
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of a single non-white color.
    color: variable (changes per example, e.g., blue, green, azure)
    location: variable start index in the row.
    surrounding_color: white (0)
transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift
  direction: right
  distance: 1 pixel
  target: The first non-white pixel encountered from the left.
  effect:
    - The first non-white pixel is moved one position to the right.
    - The original position of that first non-white pixel becomes white (0).
    - All pixels to the right of the original first non-white pixel are also shifted one position to the right.
    - Pixels to the left of the original first non-white pixel remain unchanged.
constraints:
  - The grid always contains exactly one contiguous segment of a non-white color.
  - The grid is always 1 row high.
