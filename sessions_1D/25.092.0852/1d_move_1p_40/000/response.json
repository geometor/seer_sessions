This segment is surrounded by white pixels, potentially only on one side if it starts or ends at the grid boundary.\n4.  **Transformation:** In all examples, the non-white segment appears to be shifted one position to the right. The position originally occupied by the leftmost pixel of the non-white segment becomes white in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
