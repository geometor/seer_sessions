"""
Transforms a single-row input grid by shifting the contiguous block of non-white pixels one position to the right.

1.  Identify the input grid (a single row).
2.  Locate the contiguous block of non-white pixels. Determine its start index, end index, and color.
3.  Create a new output grid of the same length, filled with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Copy the identified block into the output grid, shifting it one position to the right.
