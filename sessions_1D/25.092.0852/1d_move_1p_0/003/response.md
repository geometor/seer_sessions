"""
Perform a circular shift of all pixels in the input row one position to the right.
The input is expected to be a 2D NumPy array with a single row.
The pixel originally at the last index (rightmost position) moves to the first
index (leftmost position). All other pixels are shifted one position to the right
from their original position.
