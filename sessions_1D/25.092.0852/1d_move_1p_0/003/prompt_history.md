## Perception of the Elements

The input and output are both single rows (1D grids) of pixels.
In each example, the entire sequence of pixels appears to be shifted one position to the right.
The pixel originally at the rightmost end wraps around to become the new leftmost pixel.
The colors of the pixels and the length of the sequence are preserved, only their positions change.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
Task: Row Circular Shift Right

Input:
  Type: 1D grid (row) of pixels
  Properties:
    - Contains pixels of various colors (white=0, red=2, orange=7, azure=8 in examples).
    - Can have contiguous blocks of non-white colors.
    - Can have leading and trailing white pixels.

Output:
  Type: 1D grid (row) of pixels
  Properties:
    - Same length as the input row.
    - Same pixels (colors and count) as the input row.

Transformation:
  Action: Circular shift right
  Description: All pixels in the input row are shifted one position to the right. The pixel originally at the last position moves to the first position.
  Relationship: The output is a result of applying a single circular right shift operation to the entire input row.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Take the input row of pixels.
2.  Perform a circular shift of all pixels one position to the right.
3.  Place the pixel originally at the last index (rightmost position) into the first index (leftmost position).
4.  Shift all other pixels one position to the right from their original position.
5.  The resulting row is the output.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment

The previous execution failed due to a `ValueError` related to evaluating the truthiness of a NumPy array. This indicates that the input grids are being passed to the `transform` function as NumPy arrays, not standard Python lists as initially assumed in the validation checks (`if not input_grid:` and `if not input_grid[0]:`). The core logic of performing a circular right shift on the row's elements appears correct based on visual inspection of the examples, but the input handling needs to be adapted for NumPy arrays.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Confirm Input Type:** Assume inputs are NumPy arrays based on the error message and simulation.
2.  **Modify Validation:** Adjust the initial checks to correctly handle potential empty or invalid NumPy arrays (e.g., using `.size` or checking dimensions).
3.  **Ensure Compatibility:** Explicitly convert the relevant row to a list before applying list slicing or use NumPy-native array manipulation functions (like `np.roll`) for the circular shift. This ensures the core transformation logic works regardless of the input type nuances.
4.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the documented facts and natural language program to reflect the understanding that inputs are likely NumPy arrays representing single-row grids.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
Task: Row Circular Shift Right (NumPy Input)

Input:
  Type: 2D NumPy array representing a grid.
  Properties:
    - Consists of a single row (shape is 1xN, where N is the number of columns).
    - Contains pixels represented by integers 0-9.
    - Examples show contiguous blocks of non-white colors and leading/trailing white pixels.
    - All examples have N=25.

Output:
  Type: 2D NumPy array representing a grid.
  Properties:
    - Same shape (1xN) as the input array.
    - Contains the same pixels (values and count) as the input array.

Transformation:
  Action: Circular shift right on the single row.
  Description: All pixels within the single row of the input array are shifted one position to the right. The pixel originally at the last column index moves to the first column index (index 0).
  Relationship: The output array is the result of applying a single circular right shift operation to the row vector of the input array.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid, which is expected to be a 2D NumPy array with exactly one row.
2.  Verify the input is a valid NumPy array with at least one row and at least one column in that row. If not, return the input unchanged or handle appropriately (e.g., return an empty structure if input is empty).
3.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input array.
4.  Perform a circular shift of the elements in this row one position to the right:
    *   Take the element at the last index of the row.
    *   Take all elements from the beginning up to (but not including) the last element.
    *   Construct the new row by placing the last element at the beginning, followed by the other elements in their original relative order.
5.  Create the output 2D NumPy array containing this single, shifted row.
6.  Return the output array.
