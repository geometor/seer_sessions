Task: Row Circular Shift Right (NumPy Input)

Input:
  Type: 2D NumPy array representing a grid.
  Properties:
    - Consists of a single row (shape is 1xN, where N is the number of columns).
    - Contains pixels represented by integers 0-9.
    - Examples show contiguous blocks of non-white colors and leading/trailing white pixels.
    - All examples have N=25.

Output:
  Type: 2D NumPy array representing a grid.
  Properties:
    - Same shape (1xN) as the input array.
    - Contains the same pixels (values and count) as the input array.

Transformation:
  Action: Circular shift right on the single row.
  Description: All pixels within the single row of the input array are shifted one position to the right. The pixel originally at the last column index moves to the first column index (index 0).
  Relationship: The output array is the result of applying a single circular right shift operation to the row vector of the input array.
