            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous execution failed due to a `ValueError` related to evaluating the truthiness of a NumPy array. This indicates that the input grids are being passed to the `transform` function as NumPy arrays, not standard Python lists as initially assumed in the validation checks (`if not input_grid:` and `if not input_grid[0]:`). The core logic of performing a circular right shift on the row's elements appears correct based on visual inspection of the examples, but the input handling needs to be adapted for NumPy arrays.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Confirm Input Type:** Assume inputs are NumPy arrays based on the error message and simulation.\n2.  **Modify Validation:** Adjust the initial checks to correctly handle potential empty or invalid NumPy arrays (e.g., using `.size` or checking dimensions).\n3.  **Ensure Compatibility:** Explicitly convert the relevant row to a list before applying list slicing or use NumPy-native array manipulation functions (like `np.roll`) for the circular shift. This ensures the core transformation logic works regardless of the input type nuances.\n4.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the documented facts and natural language program to reflect the understanding that inputs are likely NumPy arrays representing single-row grids.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the examples and the error analysis:\n\n| Example   | Input Shape | Output Shape | Input Row Length | Output Row Length | Input Type (Inferred) | Notes                                  |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :----------- | :--------------- | :---------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------------- |\n| train\\_1 | (1, 25)     | (1, 25)      | 25               | 25                | `numpy.ndarray`       | Single row, circular right shift by 1. |\n| train\\_2 | (1, 25)     | (1, 25)      | 25               | 25                | `numpy.ndarray`       | Single row, circular right shift by 1. |\n| train\\_3 | (1, 25)     | (1, 25)      | 25               | 25                | `numpy.ndarray`       | Single row, circular right shift by 1. |\n\n*Note: Input Type is inferred from the execution error and confirmed via simulation.*\n\n## Documented Facts\n\n"

The pixel originally at the last column index moves to the first column index (index 0).\n  Relationship: The output array is the result of applying a single circular right shift operation to the row vector of the input array.\n```"
