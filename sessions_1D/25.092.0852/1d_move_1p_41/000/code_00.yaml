task_type: grid_transformation
dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN 2D grid)
grid_properties:
  size: fixed (1x14 in examples)
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    count: 1 per grid
    color: single non-white color (e.g., red, orange)
    shape: horizontal segment
    properties:
      - length: variable
      - color: variable (non-white)
actions:
  - name: identify_object
    target: the single non-white contiguous block
  - name: translate_object
    target: the identified block
    direction: right
    magnitude: 1 position
    constraints: preserves object color and length
output_generation:
  - create_new_grid:
      size: same as input
      initial_fill: background_color (white)
  - place_object:
      object: the translated block
      position: original_start_index + 1
