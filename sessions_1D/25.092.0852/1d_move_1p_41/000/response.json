The specific size seen is 1x14.\n2.  **Pixel Colors:** The grids contain white (0) pixels as background and blocks of a single non-white color (red=2, orange=7).\n3.  **Objects:** Each input grid features exactly one contiguous horizontal block (object) of a single non-white color.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation observed is the horizontal translation (shift) of the non-white object.\n5.  **Shift Direction & Magnitude:** In all examples, the non-white object shifts exactly one position to the right.\n6.  **Background Handling:** The background color (white) fills the position vacated by the object on its left and remains in all other positions not occupied by the shifted object.\n7.  **Object Integrity:** The color, shape (length), and internal arrangement of the non-white object remain unchanged during the shift.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
