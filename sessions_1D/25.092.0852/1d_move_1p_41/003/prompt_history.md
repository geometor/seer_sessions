## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples involve 1xN grids (single rows). The specific size seen is 1x14.
2.  **Pixel Colors:** The grids contain white (0) pixels as background and blocks of a single non-white color (red=2, orange=7).
3.  **Objects:** Each input grid features exactly one contiguous horizontal block (object) of a single non-white color.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation observed is the horizontal translation (shift) of the non-white object.
5.  **Shift Direction & Magnitude:** In all examples, the non-white object shifts exactly one position to the right.
6.  **Background Handling:** The background color (white) fills the position vacated by the object on its left and remains in all other positions not occupied by the shifted object.
7.  **Object Integrity:** The color, shape (length), and internal arrangement of the non-white object remain unchanged during the shift.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input row. Note its color and length.
2.  Determine the starting column index of this block.
3.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
4.  Copy the identified non-white block into the new output row, starting at the original starting column index plus one.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment

The previous code failed because it assumed the input grid was a standard Python `List[List[int]]`, while the testing environment likely provides it as a `numpy.ndarray`. The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" occurs when trying to use a numpy array directly in a boolean context (like `if pixel != 0:` where `pixel` might still be an array slice or element that numpy doesn't implicitly convert to a single boolean).

The strategy is to:
1.  Acknowledge that the input is likely a numpy array.
2.  Adapt the logic to work correctly with numpy array indexing and operations.
3.  Verify the core transformation logic (identifying the single non-white block and shifting it one position to the right) remains valid.
4.  Update the natural language program and facts to reflect this understanding.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's confirm the properties of the objects and the transformation using code execution. We'll represent the grids as numpy arrays for this analysis.

```
The metrics confirm the initial observations:
*   All grids are 1x14.
*   Each input has a single, contiguous, non-white horizontal block.
*   The block's color and length are preserved in the output.
*   The block is consistently shifted exactly one column to the right.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid (a 1xN numpy array).
2.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels within the single row. Determine its starting column index, length, and color.
3.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white/0).
4.  Calculate the new starting column index for the block by adding 1 to its original starting column index.
5.  Copy the identified block (preserving its color and length) into the new output grid at the calculated new starting column index.
6.  Return the new output grid.
