## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples involve 1xN grids (single rows). The specific size seen is 1x14.
2.  **Pixel Colors:** The grids contain white (0) pixels as background and blocks of a single non-white color (red=2, orange=7).
3.  **Objects:** Each input grid features exactly one contiguous horizontal block (object) of a single non-white color.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation observed is the horizontal translation (shift) of the non-white object.
5.  **Shift Direction & Magnitude:** In all examples, the non-white object shifts exactly one position to the right.
6.  **Background Handling:** The background color (white) fills the position vacated by the object on its left and remains in all other positions not occupied by the shifted object.
7.  **Object Integrity:** The color, shape (length), and internal arrangement of the non-white object remain unchanged during the shift.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input row. Note its color and length.
2.  Determine the starting column index of this block.
3.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
4.  Copy the identified non-white block into the new output row, starting at the original starting column index plus one.
```python

"""
Identifies the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row.
Shifts this block one position to the right.
Creates a new output row of the same dimensions, filled with the background color (white/0).
Places the shifted block into the new output row.
