## General Assessment

The previous code failed because it assumed the input grid was a standard Python `List[List[int]]`, while the testing environment likely provides it as a `numpy.ndarray`. The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" occurs when trying to use a numpy array directly in a boolean context (like `if pixel != 0:` where `pixel` might still be an array slice or element that numpy doesn't implicitly convert to a single boolean).

The strategy is to:
1.  Acknowledge that the input is likely a numpy array.
2.  Adapt the logic to work correctly with numpy array indexing and operations.
3.  Verify the core transformation logic (identifying the single non-white block and shifting it one position to the right) remains valid.
4.  Update the natural language program and facts to reflect this understanding.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's confirm the properties of the objects and the transformation using code execution. We'll represent the grids as numpy arrays for this analysis.


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_grid(grid_list):
    grid = np.array(grid_list)
    if grid.size == 0:
        return {"shape": grid.shape, "error": "Empty grid"}
    
    non_white_pixels = np.where(grid != 0)
    
    if len(non_white_pixels[0]) == 0:
        return {"shape": grid.shape, "has_object": False}
        
    rows, cols = non_white_pixels
    # Assuming a single horizontal block in a single row grid
    if grid.shape[0] != 1 or len(rows) == 0:
         return {"shape": grid.shape, "error": "Expected 1xN grid with object"}

    start_col = np.min(cols)
    end_col = np.max(cols)
    length = end_col - start_col + 1
    color = grid[0, start_col] # Get color from the first pixel of the block
    
    # Verify contiguous block and single color
    is_contiguous = np.all(grid[0, start_col:end_col+1] != 0)
    is_single_color = np.all(grid[0, start_col:end_col+1] == color)
    
    if not is_contiguous or not is_single_color:
        return {"shape": grid.shape, "error": "Object is not a single contiguous block of one color"}

    return {
        "shape": grid.shape,
        "has_object": True,
        "object_color": int(color),
        "object_start_col": int(start_col),
        "object_end_col": int(end_col),
        "object_length": int(length)
    }

train_inputs = [
    [[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
    [[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
]

train_outputs = [
    [[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]],
    [[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]],
]

results = []
for i in range(len(train_inputs)):
    input_analysis = analyze_grid(train_inputs[i])
    output_analysis = analyze_grid(train_outputs[i])
    
    shift = -1
    if input_analysis.get("has_object") and output_analysis.get("has_object"):
        shift = output_analysis["object_start_col"] - input_analysis["object_start_col"]
        
    results.append({
        "example": i + 1,
        "input_analysis": input_analysis,
        "output_analysis": output_analysis,
        "calculated_shift": shift
    })

print(results)
```
```
[{'example': 1, 'input_analysis': {'shape': (1, 14), 'has_object': True, 'object_color': 2, 'object_start_col': 1, 'object_end_col': 9, 'object_length': 9}, 'output_analysis': {'shape': (1, 14), 'has_object': True, 'object_color': 2, 'object_start_col': 2, 'object_end_col': 10, 'object_length': 9}, 'calculated_shift': 1}, {'example': 2, 'input_analysis': {'shape': (1, 14), 'has_object': True, 'object_color': 2, 'object_start_col': 2, 'object_end_col': 4, 'object_length': 3}, 'output_analysis': {'shape': (1, 14), 'has_object': True, 'object_color': 2, 'object_start_col': 3, 'object_end_col': 5, 'object_length': 3}, 'calculated_shift': 1}, {'example': 3, 'input_analysis': {'shape': (1, 14), 'has_object': True, 'object_color': 7, 'object_start_col': 4, 'object_end_col': 9, 'object_length': 6}, 'output_analysis': {'shape': (1, 14), 'has_object': True, 'object_color': 7, 'object_start_col': 5, 'object_end_col': 10, 'object_length': 6}, 'calculated_shift': 1}]

```
The metrics confirm the initial observations:
*   All grids are 1x14.
*   Each input has a single, contiguous, non-white horizontal block.
*   The block's color and length are preserved in the output.
*   The block is consistently shifted exactly one column to the right.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid (a 1xN numpy array).
2.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels within the single row. Determine its starting column index, length, and color.
3.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white/0).
4.  Calculate the new starting column index for the block by adding 1 to its original starting column index.
5.  Copy the identified block (preserving its color and length) into the new output grid at the calculated new starting column index.
6.  Return the new output grid.
