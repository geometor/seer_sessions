task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D (effectively 1D)
  shape: constant (1x14 in examples)
  background_color: white (0)
  data_type: numpy.ndarray (inferred from error)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    count: 1 per grid
    color: single non-white color (variable, e.g., red, orange)
    properties:
      length: variable
      location: defined by start and end column index
identification:
  method: find contiguous non-zero pixels in the single row
transformation:
  action: horizontal_translation
  target: the non-white block object
  details:
    direction: right
    magnitude: 1 column
    preserves: object color, object length
output_generation:
  - create_new_grid:
      shape: same as input
      initial_fill: background_color (white)
  - place_object:
      object: the identified block
      position: original_start_column + 1
