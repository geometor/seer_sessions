**Perception:**

The input and output are both 1-dimensional grids (rows). Each input grid contains a single contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color, surrounded by white pixels. The transformation involves shifting this colored block exactly one position to the right. The length of the colored block remains unchanged. This shift effectively makes the leftmost pixel of the original block white and colors the pixel immediately to the right of the original block with the block's color.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels in the input grid. Determine its color, its starting column index (`start`), and its ending column index (`end`).
2.  Create a new grid identical to the input grid.
3.  In the new grid, change the color of the pixel at index `start` to white (0).
4.  Check if the index `end + 1` is a valid column index within the grid's width.
5.  If `end + 1` is a valid index, change the color of the pixel at index `end + 1` in the new grid to the identified block's color.
6.  The resulting grid is the output.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment:**

The core error identified ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...") strongly indicates that the previous code, designed for Python lists, was incorrectly applied to NumPy arrays, which are the standard data structure for ARC grids. The testing framework likely passed NumPy arrays to the `transform` function. The underlying logic of identifying a single horizontal block and shifting it right seems correct based on visual inspection and the results of the metric gathering code execution. The strategy is to refine the description to explicitly account for the 2D grid structure (even if it's only 1 row high) and ensure the natural language program is clear about operating within the specific row containing the colored block.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Assume the input is a 2D grid. Identify the row containing a contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels (in all observed examples, this is the first and only row, row index 0).
2.  Within that row, find the single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels. Determine its color, its starting column index (`start_col`), and its ending column index (`end_col`).
3.  Create a new grid that is an identical copy of the input grid.
4.  In the new grid, modify the identified row: change the color of the pixel at (`row_index`, `start_col`) to white (0).
5.  Check if the column index `end_col + 1` is less than the grid's width.
6.  If `end_col + 1` is a valid column index, change the color of the pixel at (`row_index`, `end_col + 1`) in the new grid to the identified block's color.
7.  The resulting grid is the output.
