Each input grid contains a single contiguous horizontal block of a non-white color, surrounded by white pixels. The transformation involves shifting this colored block exactly one position to the right. The length of the colored block remains unchanged. This shift effectively makes the leftmost pixel of the original block white and colors the pixel immediately to the right of the original block with the block's color.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
