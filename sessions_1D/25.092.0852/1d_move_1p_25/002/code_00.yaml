task_type: object_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 2D # Explicitly 2D, although effectively 1D in examples
grid_properties:
  height: 1 # All examples have height 1
  width: variable (23 in examples)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    count: 1 # Exactly one per grid
    properties:
      color: non-white (varies: red, azure, magenta)
      shape: horizontal line segment
      location: contained entirely within the single row (row 0)
      size: variable length
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The non-white block is surrounded horizontally by white pixels within its row.
actions:
  - name: identify_object_in_row
    input: input_grid
    target: the single contiguous block of non-white color in the first row
    output: object_color, row_index (always 0), start_column, end_column
  - name: shift_object_right_in_row
    input: input_grid, object_color, row_index, start_column, end_column
    description: |-
      Create a copy of the input grid.
      Within the specified row_index:
        Set the pixel at column 'start_column' to white (0).
        If the column index (end_column + 1) is within the grid width,
          set the pixel at column (end_column + 1) to the object_color.
    output: output_grid
