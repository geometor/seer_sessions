task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (row vector)
grid_size: constant (1x10)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    count: 1 per grid
    color: non-white (variable, e.g., red, yellow, azure)
    background_color: white (0)
    properties:
      - length (variable)
      - position (variable)
actions:
  - name: horizontal_shift
    target: the non-white contiguous block
    direction: right
    distance: 1 pixel
    boundary_handling:
      - shift wraps implicitly within the grid dimensions, pushing content right.
      - the leftmost cell becomes white.
relationships:
  - input_object and output_object maintain the same color and length.
  - output_object's start position is input_object's start position + 1.
