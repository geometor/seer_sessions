The rest of the grid cells are white (0).\n*   The output grid also contains a single contiguous block of the *same* non-white color and the *same* length as the input object.\n*   Comparing the input and output, the non-white block appears to be shifted exactly one position to the right.\n*   The leftmost cell in the output is always white, accommodating the shift. The overall grid size remains constant.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
