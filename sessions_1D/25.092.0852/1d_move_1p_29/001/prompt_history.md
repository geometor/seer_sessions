Okay, analyzing the provided examples:

**Perception:**

*   Each example consists of a single input row (1D grid) and a corresponding output row of the same dimensions (1x10).
*   The input grid contains a single contiguous block (object) of a non-white color (red, yellow, or azure). The rest of the grid cells are white (0).
*   The output grid also contains a single contiguous block of the *same* non-white color and the *same* length as the input object.
*   Comparing the input and output, the non-white block appears to be shifted exactly one position to the right.
*   The leftmost cell in the output is always white, accommodating the shift. The overall grid size remains constant.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (row vector)
grid_size: constant (1x10)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    count: 1 per grid
    color: non-white (variable, e.g., red, yellow, azure)
    background_color: white (0)
    properties:
      - length (variable)
      - position (variable)
actions:
  - name: horizontal_shift
    target: the non-white contiguous block
    direction: right
    distance: 1 pixel
    boundary_handling:
      - shift wraps implicitly within the grid dimensions, pushing content right.
      - the leftmost cell becomes white.
relationships:
  - input_object and output_object maintain the same color and length.
  - output_object's start position is input_object's start position + 1.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous sequence of non-white pixels within the input row. Note its color, length, and starting index.
2.  Create a new output row of the same dimensions as the input, initialized entirely with white pixels (0).
3.  Copy the identified sequence of non-white pixels (preserving its color and length) into the output row, starting at an index one greater than its original starting index in the input row.
