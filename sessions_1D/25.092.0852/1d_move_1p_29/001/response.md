"""
Identifies a single contiguous block of a non-white color in a 1D input grid (row vector).
Shifts this block exactly one position to the right within a new grid of the same dimensions.
The leftmost cell of the output grid becomes white (0) to accommodate the shift.
The color and length of the block are preserved.
The background remains white (0).
