## Assessment and Strategy

The provided code failed on all training examples with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This indicates a mismatch between the data structure expected by the function (`List[int]`) and the data structure likely provided by the ARC testing environment (a 2D NumPy array, even if it only contains one row).

The core logic identified in the initial analysis (shifting a single contiguous block of color one step to the right) appears correct based on the visual input/output pairs. The error stems from applying list-based iteration and comparison logic directly to a NumPy array, specifically when comparing a potential sub-array (if iterating over a 2D array yields rows) with a scalar background color.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Acknowledge Input Format:** Assume the input `input_grid` is a 2D NumPy array. Based on the examples, these are specifically 1xN arrays.
2.  **Adapt Data Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to extract the relevant 1D row from the 2D input array before passing it to the `find_contiguous_block` function or performing the shift operations.
3.  **Verify Helper Function:** Ensure the `find_contiguous_block` function robustly handles a 1D sequence (either a list or a 1D NumPy array).
4.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the handling of the 2D input grid structure.

    output: block object (color, start index, length)
  - name: shift_block_right
    input: block object, 1D row array
    output: modified 1D row array
    details:
      - Create a copy of the input row.
      - If the block is not already at the rightmost edge:
        - Change the pixel at the block's original start index to the background color.
        - Change the pixel at the index immediately after the block's original end index to the block's color.
      - If the block is at the rightmost edge, make no changes.
  - name: reconstruct_grid
    input: modified 1D row array
    output: 1xN output grid
relationships:
  - The input grid contains exactly one row.
  - The row contains exactly one contiguous block of non-background color.
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - The transformation preserves the color and length of the block, shifting its column position one step to the right, unless it's already at the right edge.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid, which is a 2D NumPy array with a single row.
2.  Identify the background color, which is white (0).
3.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input grid as a 1D array or list.
4.  Scan this 1D row to find the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
5.  Record the color, the starting column index, and the ending column index of this block.
6.  Create a copy of the extracted 1D row to serve as the basis for the output row.
7.  Check if the block's ending index plus one is within the bounds of the row's length.
8.  If the shift is possible (i.e., the block is not already touching the right edge):
    a.  In the copied row, change the pixel at the recorded starting index to the background color (white).
    b.  In the copied row, change the pixel at the index immediately following the recorded ending index to the recorded block color.
9.  If the shift is not possible, the copied row remains unchanged from the original extracted row.
10. Construct the output grid by placing the modified (or unmodified) 1D row back into a 1xN 2D NumPy array structure.
11. Return the resulting output grid.
