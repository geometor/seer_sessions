elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D NumPy array
      - shape: 1 row, N columns (N=17 in examples)
      - contains: pixels
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - type: color
      - value: integer 0-9
      - background_color: white (0)
  - object: block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sequence of non-background pixels within the single row
      - color: single non-white color (e.g., orange, magenta, gray)
      - length: number of pixels in the block
      - position: start and end column indices in the row
actions:
  - name: extract_row
    input: input grid (1xN)
    output: 1D array representing the row
  - name: identify_block
    input: 1D row array
    output: block object (color, start index, length)
  - name: shift_block_right
    input: block object, 1D row array
    output: modified 1D row array
    details:
      - Create a copy of the input row.
      - If the block is not already at the rightmost edge:
        - Change the pixel at the block's original start index to the background color.
        - Change the pixel at the index immediately after the block's original end index to the block's color.
      - If the block is at the rightmost edge, make no changes.
  - name: reconstruct_grid
    input: modified 1D row array
    output: 1xN output grid
relationships:
  - The input grid contains exactly one row.
  - The row contains exactly one contiguous block of non-background color.
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - The transformation preserves the color and length of the block, shifting its column position one step to the right, unless it's already at the right edge.
