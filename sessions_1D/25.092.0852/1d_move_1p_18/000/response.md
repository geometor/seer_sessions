*   **Perception:** The task operates on 1-dimensional grids (rows). Each input row contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color against a white background. The transformation involves shifting this colored block exactly one position to the right. The leftmost pixel of the original block becomes white, and the white pixel immediately to the right of the block takes on the block's color. The overall size of the row remains unchanged.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    elements:
      - object: row
        properties:
          - type: 1D grid
          - contains: pixels
      - object: pixel
        properties:
          - type: color
          - value: integer 0-9
          - background_color: white (0)
      - object: block
        properties:
          - type: contiguous sequence of non-background pixels
          - color: single non-white color (e.g., orange, magenta, gray)
          - length: number of pixels in the block
          - position: start and end indices in the row
    actions:
      - name: identify_block
        input: input row
        output: block object (color, start index, length)
      - name: shift_block_right
        input: block object, input row
        output: modified row
        details:
          - The pixel at the block's original start index becomes white.
          - The pixel at the index immediately after the block's original end index becomes the block's color.
    relationships:
      - The block is the only non-background element in the row.
      - The output row has the same dimensions as the input row.
      - The transformation preserves the color and length of the block, only changing its position and modifying the pixels at the boundaries of the shift.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the background color, which is white (0).
    2.  Scan the input row to find the contiguous block of non-white pixels.
    3.  Record the color, the starting index, and the ending index of this block.
    4.  Create a copy of the input row to serve as the output row.
    5.  In the output row, change the pixel at the recorded starting index to the background color (white).
    6.  In the output row, change the pixel at the index immediately following the recorded ending index to the recorded block color.
    7.  Return the modified output row.
