"""
Examine the input sequence of pixels.
Find the first contiguous block of pixels that are all the same, non-white color. Record the start index and end index of this block.
Identify the pixel immediately following this block (at index `end_index + 1`). Verify this pixel exists and is white (value 0).
If such a white pixel exists immediately after the block, perform the following move:
a. Remove this white pixel from its current position (`end_index + 1`).
b. Insert a white pixel (value 0) at the position originally occupied by the start of the non-white block (`start_index`).
If no non-white block is found, or if the pixel immediately following the block is not white or does not exist, return the original input sequence unchanged.
The sequence resulting from the move operation (or the original sequence if no move was performed) is the final output.
