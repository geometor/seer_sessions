            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous execution failed with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This typically occurs when a boolean comparison is attempted on a NumPy array containing multiple elements (e.g., `if my_array == 0:` where `my_array` has more than one value). This strongly suggests that although the examples were presented in a flattened, space-separated format, the underlying data structure being processed by the execution environment is likely a NumPy array, possibly multi-dimensional (a grid). The previous code, while logically sound for a 1D list, failed when encountering this array comparison ambiguity.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Re-confirm the transformation logic based on the *flattened sequence representation* provided in the examples, as this is the only concrete data available.\n2.  Assume the execution environment might pass NumPy arrays (potentially 1D or even 2D that get flattened). The code needs to handle this, likely by converting the input to a standard Python list or carefully handling NumPy element access if necessary.\n3.  Refine the natural language program and YAML facts based on the confirmed 1D sequence manipulation pattern.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's re-examine the indices based on the 1D sequence interpretation.\n\n"
