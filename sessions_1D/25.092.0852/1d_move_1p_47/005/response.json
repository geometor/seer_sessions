Examine the input sequence of pixels, treated as a one-dimensional list.\n2. Find the first contiguous block of pixels where all pixels have the same non-white color (color is not 0). Record the start index and end index of this block.\n3. If no such non-white block is found, return the original sequence unchanged.\n4. Check the pixel immediately following the block (at index `end_index + 1`).\n5. If this index is outside the bounds of the sequence, or if the pixel at this index is not white (0), return the original sequence unchanged.\n6. Otherwise (a non-white block was found, and it's immediately followed by a white pixel):\n   a. Identify the source index: `source_index = end_index + 1`.\n   b. Identify the destination index: `destination_index = start_index`.\n   c. Create a new sequence by removing the white pixel from `source_index` and inserting a white pixel (0) at `destination_index`.\n7.
