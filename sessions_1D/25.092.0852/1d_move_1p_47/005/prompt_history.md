Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are presented as 1-dimensional sequences (lists) of integers, representing pixel colors. While ARC tasks typically use 2D grids, these examples seem flattened into a single row or are genuinely 1D.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) and one other non-white color per example (orange-7, green-3, yellow-4).
3.  **Structure:** Each input sequence consists of:
    *   An optional leading block of white pixels.
    *   A contiguous block of a single non-white color.
    *   A trailing block of white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a shift or relocation of a single white pixel. Comparing inputs and outputs:
    *   `train_1`: A `0` moves from index 17 (the start of the trailing white block) to index 0 (the beginning of the sequence, just before the orange block).
    *   `train_2`: A `0` moves from index 17 (the start of the trailing white block) to index 4 (just before the green block).
    *   `train_3`: A `0` moves from index 14 (the start of the trailing white block) to index 9 (just before the yellow block).
5.  **Pattern:** In all cases, the *first* white pixel immediately *after* the block of non-white color is removed from its position and inserted immediately *before* the block of non-white color.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input sequence. Note its start and end indices.
2.  Locate the first white pixel that immediately follows this non-white block.
3.  Remove this white pixel from its current position in the sequence.
4.  Insert the removed white pixel (value 0) into the sequence at the original start index of the non-white block.
5.  The resulting sequence is the output.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment:**

The previous execution failed with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This typically occurs when a boolean comparison is attempted on a NumPy array containing multiple elements (e.g., `if my_array == 0:` where `my_array` has more than one value). This strongly suggests that although the examples were presented in a flattened, space-separated format, the underlying data structure being processed by the execution environment is likely a NumPy array, possibly multi-dimensional (a grid). The previous code, while logically sound for a 1D list, failed when encountering this array comparison ambiguity.

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-confirm the transformation logic based on the *flattened sequence representation* provided in the examples, as this is the only concrete data available.
2.  Assume the execution environment might pass NumPy arrays (potentially 1D or even 2D that get flattened). The code needs to handle this, likely by converting the input to a standard Python list or carefully handling NumPy element access if necessary.
3.  Refine the natural language program and YAML facts based on the confirmed 1D sequence manipulation pattern.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's re-examine the indices based on the 1D sequence interpretation.

**Metrics Interpretation:**

The analysis confirms that for each training example, when treated as a 1D sequence:
*   There is exactly one contiguous block of a single non-white color.
*   This block is immediately followed by at least one white (0) pixel.
*   The transformation consists of taking the *first* white pixel immediately following the block and moving it to the position immediately *before* the block (i.e., inserting it at the block's original start index).
*   This calculated transformation perfectly matches the provided output for all three examples.

The failure was therefore not in the 1D logic itself, but likely in how that logic was implemented or how it interacted with the execution environment's data types (NumPy arrays causing ambiguous boolean checks).

    type: single_pixel
    properties:
      - Color is white (0).
      - Located at the index immediately following the `non_white_block`.
    relationships:
      - This is the pixel that will be moved.
transformation:
  action: move_pixel
  conditions:
    - A `non_white_block` must exist.
    - A `target_white_pixel` must exist at the index `end_index + 1`, where `end_index` is the last index of the `non_white_block`.
  process:
    - Identify the start index (`start_idx`) and end index (`end_idx`) of the first `non_white_block`.
    - Identify the index of the `target_white_pixel` (`source_idx = end_idx + 1`).
    - Define the destination index (`dest_idx = start_idx`).
    - Create a new sequence by:
      - Taking the elements from the original sequence up to (but not including) `dest_idx`.
      - Appending a white pixel (0).
      - Appending the elements from the original sequence from `dest_idx` up to (but not including) `source_idx`.
      - Appending the elements from the original sequence from `source_idx + 1` to the end.
    - Alternatively (procedurally): Convert input to list, remove element at `source_idx`, insert 0 at `dest_idx`.
  fallback: If conditions are not met, return the input sequence unchanged.
invariants:
  - The total number of pixels remains the same.
  - The non-white color within the block remains the same.
  - The relative order of pixels within the non_white_block is preserved.
  - The relative order of white pixels preceding the block is preserved.
  - The relative order of white pixels following the `target_white_pixel` is preserved.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input sequence of pixels. Ensure it's treated as a one-dimensional sequence, converting from a NumPy array to a list if necessary.
2.  Find the first contiguous block of pixels where all pixels have the same non-white color (color is not 0). Record the start index and end index of this block.
3.  If no such non-white block is found, return the original sequence.
4.  Check the pixel immediately following the block (at index `end_index + 1`).
5.  If this index is outside the bounds of the sequence, or if the pixel at this index is not white (0), return the original sequence.
6.  Otherwise (a non-white block was found, and it's immediately followed by a white pixel):
    a.  Identify the source index: `source_index = end_index + 1`.
    b.  Identify the destination index: `destination_index = start_index`.
    c.  Create a new sequence (or modify a copy of the input sequence): Remove the white pixel from `source_index` and insert a white pixel (0) at `destination_index`.
7.  Return the modified sequence.
