While ARC tasks typically use 2D grids, these examples seem flattened into a single row or are genuinely 1D.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) and one other non-white color per example (orange-7, green-3, yellow-4).\n3.  **Structure:** Each input sequence consists of:\n    *   An optional leading block of white pixels.\n    *   A contiguous block of a single non-white color.\n    *   A trailing block of white pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a shift or relocation of a single white pixel. Comparing inputs and outputs:\n    *   `train_1`: A `0` moves from index 17 (the start of the trailing white block) to index 0 (the beginning of the sequence, just before the orange block).\n    *   `train_2`: A `0` moves from index 17 (the start of the trailing white block) to index 4 (just before the green block).\n    *   `train_3`: A `0` moves from index 14 (the start of the trailing white block) to index 9 (just before the yellow block).\n5.  **Pattern:** In all cases, the *first* white pixel immediately *after* the block of non-white color is removed from its position and inserted immediately *before* the block of non-white color.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
