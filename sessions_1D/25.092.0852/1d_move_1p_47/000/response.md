Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are presented as 1-dimensional sequences (lists) of integers, representing pixel colors. While ARC tasks typically use 2D grids, these examples seem flattened into a single row or are genuinely 1D.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) and one other non-white color per example (orange-7, green-3, yellow-4).
3.  **Structure:** Each input sequence consists of:
    *   An optional leading block of white pixels.
    *   A contiguous block of a single non-white color.
    *   A trailing block of white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a shift or relocation of a single white pixel. Comparing inputs and outputs:
    *   `train_1`: A `0` moves from index 17 (the start of the trailing white block) to index 0 (the beginning of the sequence, just before the orange block).
    *   `train_2`: A `0` moves from index 17 (the start of the trailing white block) to index 4 (just before the green block).
    *   `train_3`: A `0` moves from index 14 (the start of the trailing white block) to index 9 (just before the yellow block).
5.  **Pattern:** In all cases, the *first* white pixel immediately *after* the block of non-white color is removed from its position and inserted immediately *before* the block of non-white color.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: sequence_manipulation
components:
  - item: pixel_sequence
    type: List[int]
    description: A 1D sequence of color values.
  - item: non_white_block
    type: contiguous_subsequence
    properties:
      - all pixels have the same non-zero color value
      - forms a single continuous block within the sequence
    relationships:
      - may be preceded by a white_block
      - must be succeeded by a white_block (based on examples)
  - item: leading_white_block
    type: contiguous_subsequence
    properties:
      - all pixels have the value 0 (white)
      - located at the beginning of the sequence, before the non_white_block
      - can be empty
  - item: trailing_white_block
    type: contiguous_subsequence
    properties:
      - all pixels have the value 0 (white)
      - located at the end of the sequence, immediately after the non_white_block
      - must contain at least one pixel for the observed transformation
transformation:
  action: move_pixel
  source_pixel:
    description: The first pixel of the trailing_white_block.
    index: index immediately following the end of the non_white_block
    value: 0 (white)
  destination_index:
    description: The index immediately preceding the start of the non_white_block.
  process:
    - Identify the start and end indices of the non_white_block.
    - Identify the index of the source_pixel (first pixel of trailing_white_block).
    - Remove the source_pixel from its original position.
    - Insert the source_pixel (value 0) at the destination_index (start index of the original non_white_block).
invariants:
  - The total number of pixels remains the same.
  - The colors and relative order of pixels within the non_white_block remain the same.
  - The colors and relative order of pixels within the leading_white_block remain the same.
  - The colors and relative order of pixels within the trailing_white_block (excluding the moved pixel) remain the same.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input sequence. Note its start and end indices.
2.  Locate the first white pixel that immediately follows this non-white block.
3.  Remove this white pixel from its current position in the sequence.
4.  Insert the removed white pixel (value 0) into the sequence at the original start index of the non-white block.
5.  The resulting sequence is the output.
