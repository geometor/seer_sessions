task_type: sequence_manipulation
components:
  - item: pixel_sequence
    type: List[int]
    description: A 1D sequence of color values.
  - item: non_white_block
    type: contiguous_subsequence
    properties:
      - all pixels have the same non-zero color value
      - forms a single continuous block within the sequence
    relationships:
      - may be preceded by a white_block
      - must be succeeded by a white_block (based on examples)
  - item: leading_white_block
    type: contiguous_subsequence
    properties:
      - all pixels have the value 0 (white)
      - located at the beginning of the sequence, before the non_white_block
      - can be empty
  - item: trailing_white_block
    type: contiguous_subsequence
    properties:
      - all pixels have the value 0 (white)
      - located at the end of the sequence, immediately after the non_white_block
      - must contain at least one pixel for the observed transformation
transformation:
  action: move_pixel
  source_pixel:
    description: The first pixel of the trailing_white_block.
    index: index immediately following the end of the non_white_block
    value: 0 (white)
  destination_index:
    description: The index immediately preceding the start of the non_white_block.
  process:
    - Identify the start and end indices of the non_white_block.
    - Identify the index of the source_pixel (first pixel of trailing_white_block).
    - Remove the source_pixel from its original position.
    - Insert the source_pixel (value 0) at the destination_index (start index of the original non_white_block).
invariants:
  - The total number of pixels remains the same.
  - The colors and relative order of pixels within the non_white_block remain the same.
  - The colors and relative order of pixels within the leading_white_block remain the same.
  - The colors and relative order of pixels within the trailing_white_block (excluding the moved pixel) remain the same.
