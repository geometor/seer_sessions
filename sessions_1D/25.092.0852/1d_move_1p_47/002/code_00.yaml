task_type: sequence_manipulation
input_description: A 1D sequence (list) of integers representing pixel colors.
output_description: A 1D sequence (list) of integers representing pixel colors, with the same length as the input.
components:
  - item: pixel_sequence
    type: List[int]
    description: A 1D sequence containing white (0) and non-white pixels.
  - item: non_white_block
    type: contiguous_subsequence
    properties:
      - all pixels have the same non-zero color value (e.g., 7, 3, 4)
      - forms a single continuous block within the sequence
    relationships:
      - identified as the first such block in the sequence
      - may be preceded by white pixels
      - must be succeeded by at least one white pixel (based on examples)
  - item: source_pixel
    type: single_pixel
    properties:
      - color_value: 0 (white)
      - location: The first pixel immediately following the non_white_block.
  - item: destination_location
    type: index_position
    properties:
      - index: The starting index of the non_white_block in the original input sequence.
transformation:
  action: move_pixel
  input: pixel_sequence
  output: modified_pixel_sequence
  steps:
    - Identify the start and end indices of the non_white_block.
    - Identify the index of the source_pixel (index = end_index + 1).
    - Check if the source_pixel exists and is white (value 0). If not, return the original sequence.
    - Create a mutable copy of the input sequence.
    - Remove the source_pixel from its original position in the copy.
    - Insert the source_pixel (value 0) at the destination_location (original start index of the non_white_block) in the copy.
    - Return the modified copy.
invariants:
  - The total number of pixels (length of the sequence) remains the same.
  - The color value of the non_white_block remains the same.
  - The relative order and values of pixels within the non_white_block remain the same.
  - The relative order and values of pixels before the non_white_block (excluding the inserted pixel) remain the same.
  - The relative order and values of pixels after the non_white_block (excluding the removed pixel) remain the same.
