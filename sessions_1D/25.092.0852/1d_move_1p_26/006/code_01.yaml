Task: Horizontal Block Shift Right

Input_Output_Pairs:
  Description: Each pair shows a single horizontal block shifting right.
  Format: Input and Output are grids (specifically 1xN arrays).

Grid_Properties:
  Dimensions: Input and Output grids have identical dimensions (e.g., 1x30).
  Background: The default pixel color is white (0).

Object:
  Type: Contiguous Block
  Identification: A single horizontal segment of adjacent, identical, non-white pixels.
  Uniqueness: Assumed exactly one such object exists per input grid.
  Attributes:
    - Color: The non-white color of the block's pixels. This is preserved.
    - Length: The number of pixels forming the block. This is preserved.
    - Location: Defined by the start and end column indices in the input row. This changes.

Transformation:
  Name: Translate Right
  Target: The identified Contiguous Block.
  Action: Shift the block horizontally by one position towards the right (increasing column index).
  Process:
    1. Find the start index, end index, and color of the block in the input row.
    2. Create an output row of the same length, filled with the background color (white).
    3. Calculate the new start index (+1) and new end index (+1).
    4. Copy the block's color into the output row from the new start index to the new end index, but only for indices that are within the grid's bounds (0 to width-1).
  Outcome: The block appears one position to the right in the output, potentially truncated if it hits the right edge. The original position becomes white.

Edge_Case_Handling:
  - Right Boundary: If the shifted block's new end index exceeds the grid width, only the part of the block fitting within the grid (up to the last column) is drawn.
  - No Block: If the input contains no non-white block, the output is identical to the input (all white).
