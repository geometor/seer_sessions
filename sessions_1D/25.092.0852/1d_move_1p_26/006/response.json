            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" strongly suggests that a previous version of the code was attempting to use a NumPy array in a boolean context (e.g., `if some_numpy_array:`), likely due to incorrect handling of NumPy comparisons or conditional logic. The subsequent Python list-based code implementations provided seem conceptually sound for the observed transformation and should not produce this specific NumPy error. The core task logic appears to be correctly identified: shifting a single colored block one position to the right. The strategy is to refine the natural language program based on the consistent visual pattern observed across all examples and confirmed by the metrics, ensuring the logic handles edge cases (like shifting off the grid), and to proceed with a robust list-based implementation.\n\n**Metrics Analysis:**\n\nThe code execution provided the following metrics, confirming the visual observations:\n\n"

This is preserved.\n    - Length: The number of pixels forming the block. This is preserved.\n    - Location: Defined by the start and end column indices in the input row. This changes.\n\nTransformation:\n  Name: Translate Right\n  Target: The identified Contiguous Block.\n  Action: Shift the block horizontally by one position towards the right (increasing column index).\n  Process:\n    1. Find the start index, end index, and color of the block in the input row.\n    2. Create an output row of the same length, filled with the background color (white).\n    3. Calculate the new start index (+1) and new end index (+1).\n    4. Copy the block's color into the output row from the new start index to the new end index, but only for indices that are within the grid's bounds (0 to width-1).\n  Outcome: The block appears one position to the right in the output, potentially truncated if it hits the right edge. The original position becomes white.\n\nEdge_Case_Handling:\n  - Right Boundary: If the shifted block's new end index exceeds the grid width, only the part of the block fitting within the grid (up to the last column) is drawn.\n  - No Block: If the input contains no non-white block, the output is identical to the input (all white).\n```"
