Okay, analyzing the provided examples:

**Perception:**

*   Each input and output is a one-dimensional array (or a 1xN grid) of pixels.
*   The primary feature in each input is a single contiguous horizontal segment (a "block") of non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels (0).
*   In `train_1`, the block is azure (8).
*   In `train_2`, the block is orange (7).
*   In `train_3`, the block is blue (1).
*   The transformation involves moving this non-white block. Comparing input and output, the block appears to shift one position to the right.
*   The color and length of the non-white block remain unchanged.
*   The overall length of the array remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Shift a horizontal block of color one position to the right.

Elements:
  - Type: Grid
    Description: A 1D array representing a row of pixels.
    Properties:
      - size: Constant length across input and output.
      - background_color: white (0)

  - Type: Object
    Description: A single contiguous block (horizontal segment) of non-white pixels within the grid.
    Properties:
      - color: Any color other than white (e.g., blue, orange, azure). Remains constant.
      - length: The number of pixels in the block. Remains constant.
      - position: Defined by start and end indices. Changes during transformation.

Transformation:
  - Action: Translate
    Target: The non-white Object.
    Details:
      - Direction: Right
      - Magnitude: 1 pixel position
      - Result: The object's start and end indices each increase by 1. The pixels previously occupied by the object become white, and the pixels newly occupied by the object take on the object's color.

Relationships:
  - The Object is surrounded by background_color pixels.
  - The transformation preserves the object's color and length.
  - The transformation preserves the grid's overall size.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input array to locate the contiguous segment of non-white pixels. Identify its color, start index, and end index.
2.  Create a new output array of the same length as the input array, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
3.  Copy the identified segment of non-white pixels from the input array into the output array, but shift its position one step to the right (i.e., start placing the segment at `start_index + 1`).
4.  Return the modified output array.

**Assessment and Strategy**

The previous execution failed with a `TypeError` related to the truth value of NumPy arrays, even though the second attempt (the one tested) was written using pure Python lists. This suggests a potential discrepancy between the expected input format (`List[List[int]]` as per ARC standard) and the format possibly used during testing (perhaps a flat `List[int]`), or an issue within the testing environment itself interacting unexpectedly with list operations.

The core logic identified (shifting a single contiguous block of non-white pixels one step to the right) appears correct based on visual inspection of the three training examples.

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-affirm the assumption that the input is a standard ARC grid (`List[List[int]]`), specifically a 1xN grid for this task.
2.  Refine the Python implementation to strictly adhere to this input format, ensuring robustness against potential format variations if possible, but primarily targeting the standard.
3.  Remove any unnecessary dependencies (like NumPy if pure Python suffices) to simplify debugging and avoid potential type conflicts.
4.  Verify the properties (start/end index, color, length) of the block in each example using code execution to confirm the pattern.

Grid_Properties:
  - Type: Background
    Description: Pixels with value 0 (white). Occupies all positions not part of the Object.
  - Size: The width (number of columns N) is constant between input and output for each example. Observed width is 30 for all training examples.

Object_Properties:
  - Type: Block
    Description: A single, contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels.
    Cardinality: Exactly one such block exists in each input grid.
    Identification: The first sequence of identical non-zero pixels encountered when scanning from left to right.
    Attributes:
      - Color: A non-zero integer (1-9). Remains constant during the transformation. (Observed: 8, 7, 1)
      - Length: The number of pixels in the segment. Remains constant during the transformation. (Observed: 15, 11, 8)
      - Start_Index: The 0-based index of the leftmost pixel of the block in the input.
      - End_Index: The 0-based index of the rightmost pixel of the block in the input.

Transformation:
  - Name: Horizontal Shift Right
  - Target: The non-white Block object.
  - Action: Translate the block one position to the right.
  - Details:
    - The new Start_Index is the input Start_Index + 1.
    - The new End_Index is the input End_Index + 1.
    - The pixels in the output grid from the new Start_Index to the new End_Index (inclusive) are set to the block's Color.
    - Boundary_Condition: If the new End_Index exceeds the grid width, the block is truncated; only the pixels that fall within the grid boundaries (index < grid_width) are colored.
    - All other pixels in the output grid are set to the Background color (0).

Relationships:
  - The Block is surrounded by Background pixels in the input (except potentially at the edges if the block starts at index 0 or ends at index N-1).
  - The transformation preserves the Block's color and length.
  - The transformation preserves the grid's overall width.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels (represented as a list within a list).
2.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input row. Determine its color, its starting index, and its ending index.
3.  Note the width of the grid.
4.  Create a new output row of the same width, initialized entirely with white pixels (0).
5.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output row by adding 1 to the identified starting index from the input row.
6.  Calculate the target ending index for the block in the output row by adding 1 to the identified ending index from the input row.
7.  Iterate from the target starting index up to the target ending index (inclusive). For each index in this range:
    a.  Check if the index is within the valid bounds of the grid width (i.e., index is greater than or equal to 0 and less than the grid width).
    b.  If the index is within bounds, set the pixel at that index in the new output row to the color of the identified block.
8.  Format the completed output row as a list within a list.
9.  Return the resulting output grid.
