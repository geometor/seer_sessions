"""
Transforms an input grid (represented as a 1xN list of lists) by identifying 
a single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels and shifting this 
block one position to the right. The background remains white (0). If the shift 
causes the block to go partially or fully off the right edge, only the part 
fitting within the grid boundaries is drawn in the output.

    Finds the start index, end index, and color of the first contiguous 
    non-zero block in a 1D list.

        A tuple (start_index, end_index, block_color) if a block is found,
