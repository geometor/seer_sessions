Task: Shift a horizontal block of color one position to the right within a 1D grid.

Input_Format: List of lists, specifically one list representing a single row (1xN grid).

Output_Format: List of lists, mirroring the input format (1xN grid).

Grid_Properties:
  - Type: Background
    Description: Pixels with value 0 (white). Occupies all positions not part of the Object.
  - Size: The width (number of columns N) is constant between input and output for each example. Observed width is 30 for all training examples.

Object_Properties:
  - Type: Block
    Description: A single, contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels.
    Cardinality: Exactly one such block exists in each input grid.
    Identification: The first sequence of identical non-zero pixels encountered when scanning from left to right.
    Attributes:
      - Color: A non-zero integer (1-9). Remains constant during the transformation. (Observed: 8, 7, 1)
      - Length: The number of pixels in the segment. Remains constant during the transformation. (Observed: 15, 11, 8)
      - Start_Index: The 0-based index of the leftmost pixel of the block in the input.
      - End_Index: The 0-based index of the rightmost pixel of the block in the input.

Transformation:
  - Name: Horizontal Shift Right
  - Target: The non-white Block object.
  - Action: Translate the block one position to the right.
  - Details:
    - The new Start_Index is the input Start_Index + 1.
    - The new End_Index is the input End_Index + 1.
    - The pixels in the output grid from the new Start_Index to the new End_Index (inclusive) are set to the block's Color.
    - Boundary_Condition: If the new End_Index exceeds the grid width, the block is truncated; only the pixels that fall within the grid boundaries (index < grid_width) are colored.
    - All other pixels in the output grid are set to the Background color (0).

Relationships:
  - The Block is surrounded by Background pixels in the input (except potentially at the edges if the block starts at index 0 or ends at index N-1).
  - The transformation preserves the Block's color and length.
  - The transformation preserves the grid's overall width.
