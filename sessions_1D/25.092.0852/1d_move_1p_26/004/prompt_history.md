Okay, analyzing the provided examples:

**Perception:**

*   Each input and output is a one-dimensional array (or a 1xN grid) of pixels.
*   The primary feature in each input is a single contiguous horizontal segment (a "block") of non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels (0).
*   In `train_1`, the block is azure (8).
*   In `train_2`, the block is orange (7).
*   In `train_3`, the block is blue (1).
*   The transformation involves moving this non-white block. Comparing input and output, the block appears to shift one position to the right.
*   The color and length of the non-white block remain unchanged.
*   The overall length of the array remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Shift a horizontal block of color one position to the right.

Elements:
  - Type: Grid
    Description: A 1D array representing a row of pixels.
    Properties:
      - size: Constant length across input and output.
      - background_color: white (0)

  - Type: Object
    Description: A single contiguous block (horizontal segment) of non-white pixels within the grid.
    Properties:
      - color: Any color other than white (e.g., blue, orange, azure). Remains constant.
      - length: The number of pixels in the block. Remains constant.
      - position: Defined by start and end indices. Changes during transformation.

Transformation:
  - Action: Translate
    Target: The non-white Object.
    Details:
      - Direction: Right
      - Magnitude: 1 pixel position
      - Result: The object's start and end indices each increase by 1. The pixels previously occupied by the object become white, and the pixels newly occupied by the object take on the object's color.

Relationships:
  - The Object is surrounded by background_color pixels.
  - The transformation preserves the object's color and length.
  - The transformation preserves the grid's overall size.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input array to locate the contiguous segment of non-white pixels. Identify its color, start index, and end index.
2.  Create a new output array of the same length as the input array, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
3.  Copy the identified segment of non-white pixels from the input array into the output array, but shift its position one step to the right (i.e., start placing the segment at `start_index + 1`).
4.  Return the modified output array.
