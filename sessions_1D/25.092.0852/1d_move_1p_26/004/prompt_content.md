"""
Identifies a single contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels in a 1D 
input grid (represented as a 1xN list of lists) and shifts this block one 
position to the right in the output grid. The background remains white (0).
If the shift causes the block to go partially or fully off the right edge, 
only the part fitting within the grid boundaries is drawn.
