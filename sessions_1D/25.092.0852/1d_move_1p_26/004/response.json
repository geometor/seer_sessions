This suggests a potential discrepancy between the expected input format (`List[List[int]]` as per ARC standard) and the format possibly used during testing (perhaps a flat `List[int]`), or an issue within the testing environment itself interacting unexpectedly with list operations.\n\nThe core logic identified (shifting a single contiguous block of non-white pixels one step to the right) appears correct based on visual inspection of the three training examples.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Re-affirm the assumption that the input is a standard ARC grid (`List[List[int]]`), specifically a 1xN grid for this task.\n2.  Refine the Python implementation to strictly adhere to this input format, ensuring robustness against potential format variations if possible, but primarily targeting the standard.\n3.  Remove any unnecessary dependencies (like NumPy if pure Python suffices) to simplify debugging and avoid potential type conflicts.\n4.  Verify the properties (start/end index, color, length) of the block in each example using code execution to confirm the pattern.\n\n**Metrics**\n"
