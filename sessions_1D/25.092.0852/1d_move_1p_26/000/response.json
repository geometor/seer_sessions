Comparing input and output, the block appears to shift one position to the right.\n*   The color and length of the non-white block remain unchanged.\n*   The overall length of the array remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Remains constant.\n      - length: The number of pixels in the block. Remains constant.\n      - position: Defined by start and end indices. Changes during transformation.\n\nTransformation:\n  - Action: Translate\n    Target: The non-white Object.\n    Details:\n      - Direction: Right\n      - Magnitude: 1 pixel position\n      - Result: The object's start and end indices each increase by 1. The pixels previously occupied by the object become white, and the pixels newly occupied by the object take on the object's color.\n\nRelationships:\n  - The Object is surrounded by background_color pixels.\n  - The transformation preserves the object's color and length.\n  - The transformation preserves the grid's overall size.\n```"
