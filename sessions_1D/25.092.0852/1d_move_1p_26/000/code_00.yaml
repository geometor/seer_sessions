Task: Shift a horizontal block of color one position to the right.

Elements:
  - Type: Grid
    Description: A 1D array representing a row of pixels.
    Properties:
      - size: Constant length across input and output.
      - background_color: white (0)

  - Type: Object
    Description: A single contiguous block (horizontal segment) of non-white pixels within the grid.
    Properties:
      - color: Any color other than white (e.g., blue, orange, azure). Remains constant.
      - length: The number of pixels in the block. Remains constant.
      - position: Defined by start and end indices. Changes during transformation.

Transformation:
  - Action: Translate
    Target: The non-white Object.
    Details:
      - Direction: Right
      - Magnitude: 1 pixel position
      - Result: The object's start and end indices each increase by 1. The pixels previously occupied by the object become white, and the pixels newly occupied by the object take on the object's color.

Relationships:
  - The Object is surrounded by background_color pixels.
  - The transformation preserves the object's color and length.
  - The transformation preserves the grid's overall size.
