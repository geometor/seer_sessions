Task: Shift a horizontal block of color one position to the right within a 1D grid.

Input_Features:
  - Type: Grid
    Description: A 1-row grid (list of lists containing one list).
    Properties:
      - height: 1
      - width: Variable (30 in examples)
      - background_color: white (0)

  - Type: Object
    Description: A single contiguous horizontal segment (block) of non-white pixels within the grid row.
    Properties:
      - color: Any color other than white (e.g., blue(1), orange(7), azure(8)).
      - length: The number of pixels in the block (variable across examples).
      - location: Defined by start and end column indices.

Output_Features:
  - Type: Grid
    Description: A 1-row grid of the same dimensions as the input.
    Properties:
      - background_color: white (0)

  - Type: Object
    Description: The same block from the input grid, shifted.
    Properties:
      - color: Identical to the input block's color.
      - length: Identical to the input block's length.
      - location: Start and end indices are exactly 1 greater than the input block's indices.

Transformation:
  - Action: Identify
    Target: The single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input grid row.
    Details: Determine its color, length, start index, and end index.

  - Action: Translate
    Target: The identified block.
    Details:
      - Direction: Right (positive column index direction)
      - Magnitude: 1 pixel position
      - Constraint: The block retains its color and length.
      - Output Construction: Create an output grid of the same size, filled with the background color. Place the translated block into the output grid at the new position (start_index + 1). If the block's new position extends beyond the grid boundary, only the portion of the block that fits within the boundary is placed.

Relationships:
  - The block is the only non-background element.
  - The transformation is purely positional (translation).
  - Grid dimensions remain constant.
