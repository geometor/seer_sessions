Okay, analyzing the provided examples:

**Perception:**

*   Each input and output is a one-dimensional array (or a 1xN grid) of pixels.
*   The primary feature in each input is a single contiguous horizontal segment (a "block") of non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels (0).
*   In `train_1`, the block is azure (8).
*   In `train_2`, the block is orange (7).
*   In `train_3`, the block is blue (1).
*   The transformation involves moving this non-white block. Comparing input and output, the block appears to shift one position to the right.
*   The color and length of the non-white block remain unchanged.
*   The overall length of the array remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Shift a horizontal block of color one position to the right.

Elements:
  - Type: Grid
    Description: A 1D array representing a row of pixels.
    Properties:
      - size: Constant length across input and output.
      - background_color: white (0)

  - Type: Object
    Description: A single contiguous block (horizontal segment) of non-white pixels within the grid.
    Properties:
      - color: Any color other than white (e.g., blue, orange, azure). Remains constant.
      - length: The number of pixels in the block. Remains constant.
      - position: Defined by start and end indices. Changes during transformation.

Transformation:
  - Action: Translate
    Target: The non-white Object.
    Details:
      - Direction: Right
      - Magnitude: 1 pixel position
      - Result: The object's start and end indices each increase by 1. The pixels previously occupied by the object become white, and the pixels newly occupied by the object take on the object's color.

Relationships:
  - The Object is surrounded by background_color pixels.
  - The transformation preserves the object's color and length.
  - The transformation preserves the grid's overall size.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input array to locate the contiguous segment of non-white pixels. Identify its color, start index, and end index.
2.  Create a new output array of the same length as the input array, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
3.  Copy the identified segment of non-white pixels from the input array into the output array, but shift its position one step to the right (i.e., start placing the segment at `start_index + 1`).
4.  Return the modified output array.

## Example 3:

**General Assessment:**

The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()" strongly suggests that a previous version of the code was attempting to use a NumPy array in a boolean context (e.g., `if some_numpy_array:`), likely due to incorrect handling of NumPy comparisons or conditional logic. The subsequent Python list-based code implementations provided seem conceptually sound for the observed transformation and should not produce this specific NumPy error. The core task logic appears to be correctly identified: shifting a single colored block one position to the right. The strategy is to refine the natural language program based on the consistent visual pattern observed across all examples and confirmed by the metrics, ensuring the logic handles edge cases (like shifting off the grid), and to proceed with a robust list-based implementation.

**Metrics Analysis:**

The code execution provided the following metrics, confirming the visual observations:

*   **Consistency:** All examples involve 1x30 grids, preserving shape.
*   **Object:** A single contiguous block of a non-white color exists in each input.
*   **Preservation:** The block's color and length are preserved in the output.
*   **Transformation:** The block consistently shifts one position to the right (start index increases by 1).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Horizontal Block Shift Right

Input_Output_Pairs:
  Description: Each pair shows a single horizontal block shifting right.
  Format: Input and Output are grids (specifically 1xN arrays).

Grid_Properties:
  Dimensions: Input and Output grids have identical dimensions (e.g., 1x30).
  Background: The default pixel color is white (0).

Object:
  Type: Contiguous Block
  Identification: A single horizontal segment of adjacent, identical, non-white pixels.
  Uniqueness: Assumed exactly one such object exists per input grid.
  Attributes:
    - Color: The non-white color of the block's pixels. This is preserved.
    - Length: The number of pixels forming the block. This is preserved.
    - Location: Defined by the start and end column indices in the input row. This changes.

Transformation:
  Name: Translate Right
  Target: The identified Contiguous Block.
  Action: Shift the block horizontally by one position towards the right (increasing column index).
  Process:
    1. Find the start index, end index, and color of the block in the input row.
    2. Create an output row of the same length, filled with the background color (white).
    3. Calculate the new start index (+1) and new end index (+1).
    4. Copy the block's color into the output row from the new start index to the new end index, but only for indices that are within the grid's bounds (0 to width-1).
  Outcome: The block appears one position to the right in the output, potentially truncated if it hits the right edge. The original position becomes white.

Edge_Case_Handling:
  - Right Boundary: If the shifted block's new end index exceeds the grid width, only the part of the block fitting within the grid (up to the last column) is drawn.
  - No Block: If the input contains no non-white block, the output is identical to the input (all white).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Receive a grid, expected to contain a single row of pixels.
2.  **Initialize:** Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, filled entirely with the background color, white (0).
3.  **Find Block:** Scan the input row to locate the first contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels (the "block"). Record its color, starting column index (`start_col`), and ending column index (`end_col`).
4.  **Check for Block:** If no such block is found (the input row is all white), proceed directly to step 6.
5.  **Shift and Draw:**
    *   Calculate the target starting column for the shifted block: `new_start_col = start_col + 1`.
    *   Calculate the target ending column for the shifted block: `new_end_col = end_col + 1`.
    *   Iterate through column indices `c` from `new_start_col` up to `new_end_col`.
    *   For each `c`, if it is a valid column index within the bounds of the output row (i.e., `0 <= c < width`), set the pixel at `output_row[c]` to the block's recorded color.
6.  **Output:** Return the final output row, formatted as a grid (a list containing the single row).
