*   **Perception:** The input consists of a single row (or can be treated as a 1D sequence) containing a block of identical non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels (color 0). The transformation shifts this block one position to the right. The pixel immediately to the left of the original block becomes white, and the white pixel immediately to the right of the original block takes on the color of the block.

*   **Facts YAML:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: array_manipulation_1d
    description: Shift a contiguous block of non-white pixels one position to the right within a 1D array.
    elements:
      - element: background
        color: 0 (white)
        role: surrounds the main object
      - element: block
        property: contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels
        role: the object being manipulated
        attributes:
          - color: varies (2, 5, 8 in examples)
          - length: varies (10, 5, 8 in examples)
          - position: varies
    actions:
      - action: identify_block
        inputs: input array
        outputs: block's color, start index, length
      - action: shift_right
        target: block
        amount: 1 position
    relationships:
      - The block is always surrounded by the background color (white).
      - The output is generated by moving the entire block one step rightward.
      - The original leftmost pixel of the block becomes the background color in the output.
      - The pixel immediately to the right of the original block's end position takes on the block's color in the output.
    constraints:
      - Input is effectively 1D.
      - Only one contiguous non-white block exists.
      - The block fits within the array boundaries after shifting.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Scan the input sequence from left to right to find the first non-white pixel. Record its index (start\_index) and color (block\_color).
    2.  Continue scanning from the start\_index to find the end of the contiguous block of block\_color pixels. Record the length of this block (block\_length).
    3.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, initially filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
    4.  Copy the block of pixels (block\_color) of length (block\_length) into the output sequence, starting at index (start\_index + 1).
