"""
Take the input grid, which is a single row of pixels.
Create a new row by inserting a white pixel (value 0) at the beginning (leftmost position) of the input row.
Remove the last pixel (rightmost position) from the newly created row to maintain the original length.
The resulting row is the output grid.
