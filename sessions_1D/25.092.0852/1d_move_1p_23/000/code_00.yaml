Task: Shift Row Contents Right
Input_Structure:
  - Single row grid (1xN)
Output_Structure:
  - Single row grid (1xN) of the same dimensions as the input.
Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous block of non-white pixels (color varies, e.g., green=3, yellow=4)
  - Quantity: Exactly one per input grid.
  - Properties: Color, Length, Position (start index).
Background:
  - Color: White (0)
Transformation:
  - Action: Shift the entire contents of the row one position to the right.
  - Mechanism: Prepend a white (0) pixel to the beginning of the row and truncate the last pixel of the row.
Consistency:
  - The transformation rule applies uniformly across all provided examples, irrespective of the specific non-white color or the initial position of the colored block.
  - Grid dimensions remain unchanged.
