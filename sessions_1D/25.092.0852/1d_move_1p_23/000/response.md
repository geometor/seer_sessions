Okay, analyzing the provided examples for the task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The examples consistently show a single row (a 1xN grid) as both input and output. The size (length) of the row remains constant between input and output (1x11 in all examples).
2.  **Pixel Colors:** The pixels use white (0) as a background color. The primary objects are contiguous blocks of a single non-white color (green=3 or yellow=4).
3.  **Object Identification:** In each input, there is exactly one contiguous block of non-white pixels. This block has a specific length and starting position.
4.  **Transformation:** Comparing input and output, the block of non-white pixels appears to shift one position to the right within the row. The rest of the row is filled with white pixels. This shift is consistent regardless of the non-white color used or the initial position of the block.
5.  **Mechanism:** The rightward shift can be achieved by inserting a white pixel (0) at the beginning (index 0) of the row and removing the pixel at the end of the row.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Shift Row Contents Right
Input_Structure:
  - Single row grid (1xN)
Output_Structure:
  - Single row grid (1xN) of the same dimensions as the input.
Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous block of non-white pixels (color varies, e.g., green=3, yellow=4)
  - Quantity: Exactly one per input grid.
  - Properties: Color, Length, Position (start index).
Background:
  - Color: White (0)
Transformation:
  - Action: Shift the entire contents of the row one position to the right.
  - Mechanism: Prepend a white (0) pixel to the beginning of the row and truncate the last pixel of the row.
Consistency:
  - The transformation rule applies uniformly across all provided examples, irrespective of the specific non-white color or the initial position of the colored block.
  - Grid dimensions remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input grid, which is a single row of pixels.
2.  Create a new row by inserting a white pixel (value 0) at the beginning (leftmost position) of the input row.
3.  Remove the last pixel (rightmost position) from the newly created row to maintain the original length.
4.  The resulting row is the output grid.
