*   **Perception:** The task operates on single-row inputs. Each input contains a contiguous block of non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels. The transformation involves shifting this block of non-white pixels one position to the right. The position originally occupied by the first pixel of the block becomes white. The length of the row remains unchanged.

## Example 3:

**Assessment and Strategy:**

The primary issue stems from an incorrect assumption about the input data format. The error message `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous` strongly indicates that the code attempted a boolean check on an array (likely NumPy) instead of a single value. This usually happens when processing a 2D array (list of lists) as if it were a 1D list. The ARC standard format uses lists of lists even for single rows (e.g., `[[0, 0, 2, 2, 0]]`). The previous code assumed a flat list (`[0, 0, 2, 2, 0]`).

The strategy is to:
1.  Correctly interpret the input as a 2D grid (specifically, a 1xN grid).
2.  Adapt the code to extract the single row from the input grid before processing.
3.  Ensure the output is also formatted as a 1xN grid.
4.  Update the observations and natural language program to reflect this 1xN structure.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input grid, which consists of a single row of pixels.
2.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels within this row. Record its starting column index and the sequence of its pixel colors.
3.  Create a new output grid with the exact same dimensions (1 row, same number of columns) as the input grid, filling it entirely with white (0) pixels initially.
4.  Calculate the new starting column index for the block by adding 1 to the original starting column index found in step 2.
5.  Place the recorded sequence of non-white pixel colors into the single row of the output grid, beginning at the calculated new starting column index. The rest of the output row remains white.
6.  Return the completed output grid.
