task_type: transformation
input_dimensionality: 2D (1xN grid)
output_dimensionality: 2D (1xN grid, same N as input)
input_features:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - shape: 1 row, variable number of columns (N)
  - element: row
    description: The single row within the input grid.
    properties:
      - contains: background pixels and one object
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0), red (2), gray (5)
  - element: object
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels within the row.
    properties:
      - color: uniform (red or gray in examples)
      - location: defined by start and end column index within the row
      - length: variable
  - element: background
    description: White pixels surrounding the object within the row.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
transformation:
  - action: select
    target: the first (and only) row of the input grid
  - action: identify
    source: the selected row
    target: the contiguous block of non-white pixels (the object)
    properties: [start_column, end_column, pixel_sequence]
  - action: create
    target: output grid
    properties:
      - shape: same as input grid (1xN)
      - initial_fill: white (0)
  - action: calculate
    input: object's start_column
    operation: add 1
    output: new_start_column
  - action: place
    target: the single row of the output grid
    source: the identified object's pixel_sequence
    location: starting at new_start_column
relationships:
  - The object is always fully contained within the row boundaries in both input and output.
  - The output grid dimensions are identical to the input grid dimensions.
  - The object's pixel colors and length remain unchanged during the transformation.
  - The transformation is a horizontal shift of the object by one position to the right.
