"""
Identifies the contiguous block of non-white pixels within the single-row input grid. 
Shifts this block one position to the right. 
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input, with the shifted block placed 
and the remaining pixels set to white (0). The pixel at the original starting position 
of the block becomes white.
