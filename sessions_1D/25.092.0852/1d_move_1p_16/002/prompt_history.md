*   **Perception:** The task operates on single-row inputs. Each input contains a contiguous block of non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels. The transformation involves shifting this block of non-white pixels one position to the right. The position originally occupied by the first pixel of the block becomes white. The length of the row remains unchanged.

*   **Facts:**

    task_type: transformation
    input_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
    output_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
    input_features:
      - element: pixel
        properties:
          - color: white (0), red (2), gray (5)
      - element: object
        description: A contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
        properties:
          - color: uniform (red or gray in examples)
          - location: defined by start and end index
          - length: variable
      - element: background
        description: White pixels surrounding the object.
        properties:
          - color: white (0)
    transformation:
      - action: identify
        target: the contiguous block of non-white pixels (the object)
      - action: shift
        target: the identified object
        direction: right
        distance: 1 position
      - action: update
        target: the pixel at the original starting position of the object
        new_value: white (0)
    relationships:
      - The object is always surrounded by background pixels.
      - The output row has the same length as the input row.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input row. Note its starting index, ending index, and the sequence of pixel colors within the block.
    2.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
    3.  Copy the identified sequence of non-white pixels into the output row, starting at an index one greater than the original starting index.
    4.  Ensure all other positions in the output row remain white (0).

"""
Identifies the contiguous block of non-white pixels within the single-row input grid. 
Shifts this block one position to the right. 
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input, with the shifted block placed

of the block becomes white.
