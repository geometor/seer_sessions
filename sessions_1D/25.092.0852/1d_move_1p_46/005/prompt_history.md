*   **Perception**:
    *   All examples operate on a 1-dimensional grid (a single row).
    *   Each input grid contains a contiguous block of a single non-white color, surrounded by white pixels (color 0).
    *   The output grid has the same dimensions and contains the same pixels as the input grid.
    *   The transformation involves changing the positions of the pixels within the grid.
    *   Comparing input and output, the entire sequence of pixels appears to be shifted one position to the right.
    *   The pixel originally at the rightmost position in the input grid moves to the leftmost position in the output grid. This indicates a circular or wrap-around shift.

*   **Facts**:

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the input grid as a single row of pixels.
    2.  Perform a circular shift of all pixels in the row one position to the right.
    3.  To achieve this, take the pixel from the last (rightmost) position of the input grid.
    4.  Place this pixel at the first (leftmost) position of the output grid.
    5.  Shift all remaining pixels from the input grid (from the first position up to the second-to-last position) one position to the right and place them in the output grid, starting from the second position.
    6.  The resulting grid is the output.

*   **General Assessment**:
    The initial hypothesis of a circular right shift applied to the entire grid was incorrect. The results clearly show that only a specific part of the grid, the contiguous block of non-white pixels, is shifted. The rest of the grid elements (white pixels) remain in place or are displaced by the shifting block. The core task is to identify this non-white block and move it one position to the right, ensuring it doesn't wrap around or push elements off the grid boundaries if possible (though in these examples, there's always space).

*   **Strategy**:
    1.  Re-analyze the input-output pairs to confirm the new hypothesis: identifying and shifting only the non-white block.
    2.  Use code execution to precisely locate the start and end indices of the non-white block in both input and output for each example.
    3.  Update the `Facts` YAML block to reflect this object-based shift.
    4.  Rewrite the `Natural Language Program` to describe the process of finding the block and shifting it right by one position.

*   **Metrics Gathering**:
    Let's find the start index, end index (exclusive), and length of the non-white block in each input and output.

      mechanism:
        - Identify the start and end indices of the non-white block in the input.
        - Create an output grid of the same size, initialized with the background color (white).
        - Copy the non-white block from the input to the output grid, starting at an index one greater than its original start index.
      constraints:
        - The block maintains its color and length.
        - The shift is non-circular; it occurs within the grid boundaries.
        - Background pixels are effectively overwritten by the shifting block at its new location and fill the space left behind by the block at its original location.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Receive the input grid (a single row of pixels).
    2.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input grid. Determine its color, start index, and end index (or length).
    3.  Create a new output grid of the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
    4.  Calculate the new start index for the block in the output grid by adding 1 to the original start index.
    5.  Copy the identified non-white block (using its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated new start index.
    6.  The resulting grid, containing the shifted block and the background white pixels, is the final output.
