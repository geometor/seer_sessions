*   **Perception**:
    *   All examples operate on a 1-dimensional grid (a single row).
    *   Each input grid contains a contiguous block of a single non-white color, surrounded by white pixels (color 0).
    *   The output grid has the same dimensions and contains the same pixels as the input grid.
    *   The transformation involves changing the positions of the pixels within the grid.
    *   Comparing input and output, the entire sequence of pixels appears to be shifted one position to the right.
    *   The pixel originally at the rightmost position in the input grid moves to the leftmost position in the output grid. This indicates a circular or wrap-around shift.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are single rows
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_block
        description: A sequence of identical non-white pixels.
        properties:
          color: Varies (yellow, azure, magenta in examples)
          length: Varies
      - type: background
        description: White pixels surrounding the non-white block.
        properties:
          color: white (0)
    action:
      type: circular_shift
      direction: right
      amount: 1 position
      description: The entire sequence of pixels in the input grid is shifted one step to the right. The pixel at the last position wraps around to become the first pixel in the output grid.
    relationships:
      - The non-white block maintains its color, length, and internal order during the shift.
      - The relative order of all pixels is maintained, except for the wrap-around element.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the input grid as a single row of pixels.
    2.  Perform a circular shift of all pixels in the row one position to the right.
    3.  To achieve this, take the pixel from the last (rightmost) position of the input grid.
    4.  Place this pixel at the first (leftmost) position of the output grid.
    5.  Shift all remaining pixels from the input grid (from the first position up to the second-to-last position) one position to the right and place them in the output grid, starting from the second position.
    6.  The resulting grid is the output.
