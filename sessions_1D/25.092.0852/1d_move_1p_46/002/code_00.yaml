task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Input and output are single rows (lists/1D arrays)
grid_properties:
  input_length: 20 (constant in examples)
  output_length: 20 (constant in examples)
objects:
  - type: pixel_sequence
    description: The entire input grid treated as an ordered sequence of pixels.
    properties:
      colors: Mixed, includes white (0) and one other non-white color block in examples.
      length: Fixed (20 in examples).
action:
  type: circular_shift
  direction: right
  amount: 1 position
  description: The entire sequence of pixels in the input row is shifted one step to the right. The pixel originally at the last (rightmost) index moves to the first (leftmost) index in the output row, maintaining the relative order of all other pixels.
relationships:
  - The length of the sequence remains unchanged.
  - The set of pixel values remains unchanged.
  - The relative order of pixels is preserved, except for the wrap-around element.
