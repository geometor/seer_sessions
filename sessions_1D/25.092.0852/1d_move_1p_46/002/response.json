            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation as a circular right shift applied to a 1D input grid (represented as a single row or list). The failure during execution stemmed from an implementation detail within the helper function `circular_shift_right`, specifically the condition `if not grid_1d:`. This check is ambiguous for non-empty NumPy arrays, leading to the `ValueError`.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the emptiness check within the `circular_shift_right` function to be compatible with NumPy arrays (e.g., by checking `grid_1d.size == 0`) while preserving the core circular shift logic. The overall understanding of the task's objective appears sound.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the provided examples:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input: `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length: 20)\n*   Output: `[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]` (Length: 20)\n*   Transformation: Right circular shift by 1. The last element `0` moved to the first position.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input: `[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length: 20)\n*   Output: `[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length: 20)\n*   Transformation: Right circular shift by 1. The last element `0` moved to the first position.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length: 20)\n*   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Length: 20)\n*   Transformation: Right circular shift by 1. The last element `0` moved to the first position.\n\nAll examples consistently show a right circular shift of 1 position applied to the entire 1D input sequence. The input length is constant (20) across these examples.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
