*   **Perception**:
    *   All examples operate on a 1-dimensional grid (a single row).
    *   Each input grid contains a contiguous block of a single non-white color, surrounded by white pixels (color 0).
    *   The output grid has the same dimensions and contains the same pixels as the input grid.
    *   The transformation involves changing the positions of the pixels within the grid.
    *   Comparing input and output, the entire sequence of pixels appears to be shifted one position to the right.
    *   The pixel originally at the rightmost position in the input grid moves to the leftmost position in the output grid. This indicates a circular or wrap-around shift.

*   **Facts**:

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the input grid as a single row of pixels.
    2.  Perform a circular shift of all pixels in the row one position to the right.
    3.  To achieve this, take the pixel from the last (rightmost) position of the input grid.
    4.  Place this pixel at the first (leftmost) position of the output grid.
    5.  Shift all remaining pixels from the input grid (from the first position up to the second-to-last position) one position to the right and place them in the output grid, starting from the second position.
    6.  The resulting grid is the output.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: could not broadcast input array from shape (20,) into shape (0,)

## Example 2:
Error: could not broadcast input array from shape (20,) into shape (0,)

## Example 3:
Error: could not broadcast input array from shape (20,) into shape (0,)
**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code attempt implemented the "block shift" hypothesis, which aligns correctly with Example 3 but failed during execution with a broadcasting error. The error message ("could not broadcast input array from shape (20,) into shape (0,)") indicates an attempt to assign an array of size 20 into a slice of size 0. This likely points to an indexing error (e.g., `new_start_index >= new_end_index`) or a misunderstanding in how array slicing assignment was performed in the specific execution context, as the provided code snippet itself seemed logically sound for assigning a scalar `block_color`.

The analysis of all examples using `tool_code` strongly confirms the "block shift" transformation: identify the single contiguous non-white block and shift it exactly one position to the right, filling the vacated space and the rest of the grid with the background color (white).

The strategy is to refine the Natural Language Program to precisely describe this block shift and then implement it carefully, ensuring correct calculation of indices and proper assignment into the new grid.

    description: The single sequence of identical non-white pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      color: The non-white color value (varies: 4, 8, 6).
      length: The number of pixels in the block (varies: 16, 15, 5).
      start_index_input: The 0-based index where the block begins in the input (varies: 0, 0, 4).
      end_index_input: The 0-based index *after* the last pixel of the block in the input (varies: 16, 15, 9).
  - type: background
    description: White pixels (color 0).
    properties: Fills the grid space not occupied by the non-white block.

  type: shift_block_right

    shift_amount: 1
  description: >
    Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input grid.
    Determine its color, start index, and end index (exclusive).
    Create a new grid of the same size as the input, initialized with the background color (white, 0).
    Calculate the new start index for the block by adding 1 to the original start index.
    Calculate the new end index for the block by adding 1 to the original end index.
    Fill the portion of the new grid from the new start index up to (but not including) the new end index with the identified block color.
constraints:
  - Assumes exactly one contiguous non-white block exists in the input.
  - Assumes the shifted block will fit within the grid boundaries (new end index <= grid size).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid (a 1D list or array of integers).
2.  Find the start index, end index (exclusive), and color of the single contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels within the input grid.
3.  If no non-white block is found (the input grid is all white), return a copy of the input grid.
4.  Calculate the length of the input grid.
5.  Create a new output grid of the same length, filled entirely with white pixels (value 0).
6.  Calculate the target start index for the block in the output grid by adding 1 to the found start index from the input grid.
7.  Calculate the target end index (exclusive) for the block in the output grid by adding 1 to the found end index from the input grid.
8.  Fill the segment of the output grid, starting at the target start index and ending before the target end index, with the color of the found block.
9.  Return the modified output grid.
