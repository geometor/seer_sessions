**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code attempt implemented the "block shift" hypothesis, which aligns correctly with Example 3 but failed during execution with a broadcasting error. The error message ("could not broadcast input array from shape (20,) into shape (0,)") indicates an attempt to assign an array of size 20 into a slice of size 0. This likely points to an indexing error (e.g., `new_start_index >= new_end_index`) or a misunderstanding in how array slicing assignment was performed in the specific execution context, as the provided code snippet itself seemed logically sound for assigning a scalar `block_color`.

The analysis of all examples using `tool_code` strongly confirms the "block shift" transformation: identify the single contiguous non-white block and shift it exactly one position to the right, filling the vacated space and the rest of the grid with the background color (white).

The strategy is to refine the Natural Language Program to precisely describe this block shift and then implement it carefully, ensuring correct calculation of indices and proper assignment into the new grid.

  - Assumes exactly one contiguous non-white block exists in the input.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid (a 1D list or array of integers).
2.  Find the start index, end index (exclusive), and color of the single contiguous block of non-white (non-zero) pixels within the input grid.
3.  If no non-white block is found (the input grid is all white), return a copy of the input grid.
4.  Calculate the length of the input grid.
5.  Create a new output grid of the same length, filled entirely with white pixels (value 0).
6.  Calculate the target start index for the block in the output grid by adding 1 to the found start index from the input grid.
7.  Calculate the target end index (exclusive) for the block in the output grid by adding 1 to the found end index from the input grid.
8.  Fill the segment of the output grid, starting at the target start index and ending before the target end index, with the color of the found block.
9.  Return the modified output grid.
