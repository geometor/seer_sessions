*   **General Assessment**:
    The initial hypothesis of a circular right shift applied to the entire grid was incorrect. The results clearly show that only a specific part of the grid, the contiguous block of non-white pixels, is shifted. The rest of the grid elements (white pixels) remain in place or are displaced by the shifting block. The core task is to identify this non-white block and move it one position to the right, ensuring it doesn't wrap around or push elements off the grid boundaries if possible (though in these examples, there's always space).

*   **Strategy**:
    1.  Re-analyze the input-output pairs to confirm the new hypothesis: identifying and shifting only the non-white block.
    2.  Use code execution to precisely locate the start and end indices of the non-white block in both input and output for each example.
    3.  Update the `Facts` YAML block to reflect this object-based shift.
    4.  Rewrite the `Natural Language Program` to describe the process of finding the block and shifting it right by one position.

*   **Metrics Gathering**:
    Let's find the start index, end index (exclusive), and length of the non-white block in each input and output.


``` python
import numpy as np

def find_non_white_block(grid_1d):
    """Finds the start index, end index (exclusive), and length of the first contiguous non-white block."""
    grid_array = np.array(grid_1d)
    non_white_indices = np.where(grid_array != 0)[0]
    if len(non_white_indices) == 0:
        return None, None, 0 # No non-white block found
    
    start_index = non_white_indices[0]
    # Check for contiguity
    for i in range(len(non_white_indices) - 1):
        if non_white_indices[i+1] != non_white_indices[i] + 1:
            # Handle cases with multiple blocks - for this task, assume one block
            # Based on examples, we take the first contiguous block
            end_index = non_white_indices[i] + 1
            length = end_index - start_index
            return start_index, end_index, length
            
    # If the loop finishes, the block is contiguous to the end
    end_index = non_white_indices[-1] + 1
    length = end_index - start_index
    return start_index, end_index, length

examples = [
    {
        "input": [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],

for i, ex in enumerate(examples):
    in_start, in_end, in_len = find_non_white_block(ex["input"])
    out_start, out_end, out_len = find_non_white_block(ex["output"])
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    print(f"  Input Block:  start={in_start}, end={in_end}, length={in_len}")
    print(f"  Output Block: start={out_start}, end={out_end}, length={out_len}")

```
```
Example 1:
  Input Block:  start=0, end=16, length=16
  Output Block: start=1, end=17, length=16
  Shift Amount (Output Start - Input Start): 1
--------------------
Example 2:
  Input Block:  start=0, end=15, length=15
  Output Block: start=1, end=16, length=15
  Shift Amount (Output Start - Input Start): 1
--------------------
Example 3:
  Input Block:  start=4, end=9, length=5
  Output Block: start=5, end=10, length=5
  Shift Amount (Output Start - Input Start): 1
--------------------

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples are single rows
    input_composition:
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
        count: variable
      - type: contiguous_block
        color: non-white (varies: yellow, azure, magenta)
        count: 1
        length: variable
        position: variable (can start at index 0 or later)
    output_composition: Same as input (same colors, block length, grid size)
    transformation:
      action: selective_shift
      target: the single contiguous block of non-white pixels
      direction: right
      amount: 1 position
      mechanism:
        - Identify the start and end indices of the non-white block in the input.
        - Create an output grid of the same size, initialized with the background color (white).
        - Copy the non-white block from the input to the output grid, starting at an index one greater than its original start index.
      constraints:
        - The block maintains its color and length.
        - The shift is non-circular; it occurs within the grid boundaries.
        - Background pixels are effectively overwritten by the shifting block at its new location and fill the space left behind by the block at its original location.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Receive the input grid (a single row of pixels).
    2.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input grid. Determine its color, start index, and end index (or length).
    3.  Create a new output grid of the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
    4.  Calculate the new start index for the block in the output grid by adding 1 to the original start index.
    5.  Copy the identified non-white block (using its original color and length) into the output grid, starting at the calculated new start index.
    6.  The resulting grid, containing the shifted block and the background white pixels, is the final output.
