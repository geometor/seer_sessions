            "text": "*   **General Assessment**:\n    The initial hypothesis of a circular right shift applied to the entire grid was incorrect. The results clearly show that only a specific part of the grid, the contiguous block of non-white pixels, is shifted. The rest of the grid elements (white pixels) remain in place or are displaced by the shifting block. The core task is to identify this non-white block and move it one position to the right, ensuring it doesn't wrap around or push elements off the grid boundaries if possible (though in these examples, there's always space).\n\n*   **Strategy**:\n    1.  Re-analyze the input-output pairs to confirm the new hypothesis: identifying and shifting only the non-white block.\n    2.  Use code execution to precisely locate the start and end indices of the non-white block in both input and output for each example.\n    3.  Update the `Facts` YAML block to reflect this object-based shift.\n    4.  Rewrite the `Natural Language Program` to describe the process of finding the block and shifting it right by one position.\n\n*   **Metrics Gathering**:\n    Let's find the start index, end index (exclusive), and length of the non-white block in each input and output.\n\n"
