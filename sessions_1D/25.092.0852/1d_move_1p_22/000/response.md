*   **Perception:**
    *   The task operates on single-row grids (1D arrays of pixels).
    *   Each example shows a sequence of pixels being shifted one position to the right.
    *   The first pixel in the output row is always white (0).
    *   The last pixel of the input row is effectively dropped, and a white pixel is inserted at the beginning.
    *   The transformation preserves the length of the row.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: Grid Transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
    transformation_type: Shift Operation
    components:
      - element: pixel_row
        description: A sequence of pixels representing colors.
    actions:
      - name: right_shift_with_insertion
        target: pixel_row
        input_element_indices: 0 to (width - 2)
        output_element_indices: 1 to (width - 1)
        details: Pixels from index 0 to width-2 of the input row are moved to index 1 to width-1 of the output row.
      - name: insert_pixel
        target: pixel_row
        output_element_index: 0
        value: white (0)
        details: The first pixel (index 0) of the output row is set to white.
    relationships:
      - The output row length is identical to the input row length.
      - The output row at index `i` (for `i > 0`) contains the value of the input row at index `i-1`.
      - The output row at index 0 is always white (0).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an output row with the same length as the input row.
    2.  Set the first element (index 0) of the output row to white (value 0).
    3.  Iterate through the input row from the first element (index 0) up to the second-to-last element (index `width - 2`).
    4.  For each element at index `j` in the input row during this iteration, copy its value to the element at index `j + 1` in the output row.
    5.  Return the completed output row.
