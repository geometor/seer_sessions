*   **General Assessment:** The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a contiguous block of non-white pixels one position to the right within a 1D row. However, the Python code failed because it assumed the input `input_grid` would be a standard Python list of lists, while the testing environment likely provided it as a NumPy array. The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" confirms this incompatibility when checking the truthiness of the array directly (e.g., `if not input_grid:`). The strategy is to adapt the code to handle NumPy arrays correctly.

*   **Metrics:**
    Let's confirm the input type and shape using the first training example.
    
``` python
    import numpy as np

    train_1_input = np.array([[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    train_1_output = np.array([[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]])

    train_2_input = np.array([[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    train_2_output = np.array([[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]])

    train_3_input = np.array([[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    train_3_output = np.array([[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]])

    print(f"Train 1 Input Type: {type(train_1_input)}")

    print(f"\nTrain 2 Input Shape: {train_2_input.shape}")
    print(f"Train 2 Output Shape: {train_2_output.shape}")

    print(f"\nTrain 3 Input Shape: {train_3_input.shape}")
    print(f"Train 3 Output Shape: {train_3_output.shape}")

        else:
             # This handles cases with multiple blocks or non-contiguous non-white cells, 
             # but based on examples, only the first contiguous matters.
             # Re-evaluating based on *first* contiguous block:
             end_index_simple = start_index + 1
             while end_index_simple < len(row_array) and row_array[end_index_simple] == block_color:

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN numpy array)
    grid_size_input: [1, 9] # Examples show 1x9
    grid_size_output: [1, 9] # Examples show 1x9, same as input
    input_format: numpy.ndarray
    output_format: numpy.ndarray
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_block
        color: non-white (green, magenta, blue in examples)
        background_color: white (0)
        count_per_example: 1
        location: occupies a single contiguous horizontal segment within the row.
    actions:
      - type: shift
        direction: right
        distance: 1 pixel
        target: the contiguous_block of non-white pixels
        effect: The block moves one position right. The space previously occupied by the block's leftmost pixel becomes white. The space to the right of the block's original rightmost pixel takes on the block's color.
    relationships:
      - The shape of the grid remains constant ((1, N) -> (1, N)).
      - The color and length of the non-white block remain constant.
      - The block is always surrounded by white pixels in the input, except possibly at the very beginning of the row (Example 2).
      - The output block is shifted exactly one position to the right relative to its input position.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept the input as a 1xN NumPy array.
    2.  Identify the single contiguous segment (block) of non-white pixels (pixels with value != 0) within the row. Determine its starting column index, its length, and its color.
    3.  Create a new output NumPy array of the same shape (1xN) as the input, initialized entirely with white pixels (value 0).
    4.  Calculate the new starting column index for the block by adding 1 to the original starting index.
    5.  Copy the identified non-white block (using its original color and length) into the new output array, starting at the calculated new starting index. Ensure the block placement stays within the array bounds.
