            "text": "*   **General Assessment:** The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a contiguous block of non-white pixels one position to the right within a 1D row. However, the Python code failed because it assumed the input `input_grid` would be a standard Python list of lists, while the testing environment likely provided it as a NumPy array. The error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" confirms this incompatibility when checking the truthiness of the array directly (e.g., `if not input_grid:`). The strategy is to adapt the code to handle NumPy arrays correctly.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    Let's confirm the input type and shape using the first training example.\n    "
