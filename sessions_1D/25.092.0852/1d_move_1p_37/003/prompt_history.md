*   **Perception:** The input consists of a single row (1D grid) of pixels. Within this row, there is a contiguous block of non-white pixels surrounded by white pixels. The output is a row of the same size where the non-white block has been shifted one position to the right. The pixels vacated by the block become white, and the pixels the block moves into adopt the block's color.

      - The size of the grid remains constant.
      - The color and length of the non-white block remain constant.
      - The block is always surrounded by white pixels before and after the shift.
      - The shift moves the entire block uniformly.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
*   **General Assessment:** The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a contiguous block of non-white pixels one position to the right within a 1D row. However, the Python code failed because it assumed the input `input_grid` would be a standard Python list of lists, while the testing environment likely provided it as a NumPy array. The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" confirms this incompatibility when checking the truthiness of the array directly (e.g., `if not input_grid:`). The strategy is to adapt the code to handle NumPy arrays correctly.

*   **Metrics:**
    Let's confirm the input type and shape using the first training example.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept the input as a 1xN NumPy array.
    2.  Identify the single contiguous segment (block) of non-white pixels (pixels with value != 0) within the row. Determine its starting column index, its length, and its color.
    3.  Create a new output NumPy array of the same shape (1xN) as the input, initialized entirely with white pixels (value 0).
    4.  Calculate the new starting column index for the block by adding 1 to the original starting index.
    5.  Copy the identified non-white block (using its original color and length) into the new output array, starting at the calculated new starting index. Ensure the block placement stays within the array bounds.
