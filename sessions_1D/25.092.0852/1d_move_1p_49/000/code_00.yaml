task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Represented as a single row
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: non_white # Can be orange (7), yellow (4), red (2) in examples
    count: 1
transformation:
  type: shift
  object_to_transform: the contiguous_block of non_white pixels
  direction: right
  distance: 1 pixel
  details: The entire block moves as one unit. The position vacated by the leftmost pixel of the block becomes white (0). The position to the right of the original rightmost pixel of the block is replaced by the rightmost pixel of the shifted block.
