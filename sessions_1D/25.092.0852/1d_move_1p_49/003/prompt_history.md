**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input and output data are presented as single rows of pixels (1D arrays). Each input row contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels against a white background (color 0). The output row is identical to the input row, except that the entire block of non-white pixels has been shifted one position to the right. The background pixels adjust accordingly, filling the space vacated by the shift and being replaced by the shifted block.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Represented as a single row
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: non_white # Can be orange (7), yellow (4), red (2) in examples
    count: 1
transformation:
  type: shift
  object_to_transform: the contiguous_block of non_white pixels
  direction: right
  distance: 1 pixel
  details: The entire block moves as one unit. The position vacated by the leftmost pixel of the block becomes white (0). The position to the right of the original rightmost pixel of the block is replaced by the rightmost pixel of the shifted block.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row. Note its color, starting position (index), and ending position (index).
2.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initialized with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Copy the identified block of non-white pixels into the output row, but start it one position (index + 1) to the right compared to its starting position in the input row.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment:**

The error `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous` strongly suggests that the `transform` function, designed to work on a 1D Python list, was passed a 2D NumPy array (as is standard in ARC). Operations within the function or the testing harness likely attempted a boolean evaluation on the multi-element array directly.

The core logic observed (shifting a horizontal block one step right) appears correct based on the input/output pairs. The strategy is to adapt the implementation to correctly handle the 2D NumPy array input format, specifically by operating on the single row contained within the grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive a 2D input grid which consists of a single row.
2.  Identify the single contiguous horizontal segment (block) of non-white pixels within that row. Determine its color, starting column index, and ending column index.
3.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Copy the identified segment of non-white pixels into the first row of the output grid, placing it such that its starting column index is one greater than its starting column index in the input grid. Ensure the segment's color and length are preserved.
