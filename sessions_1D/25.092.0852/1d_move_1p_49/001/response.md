"""
Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row. 
Note its color, starting position (index), and ending position (index).
Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initialized with the background color (white, 0).
Copy the identified block of non-white pixels into the output row, but start it one position (index + 1) to the right compared to its starting position in the input row.
