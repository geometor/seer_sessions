**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input and output data are presented as single rows of pixels (1D arrays). Each input row contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels against a white background (color 0). The output row is identical to the input row, except that the entire block of non-white pixels has been shifted one position to the right. The background pixels adjust accordingly, filling the space vacated by the shift and being replaced by the shifted block.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Represented as a single row
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: non_white # Can be orange (7), yellow (4), red (2) in examples
    count: 1
transformation:
  type: shift
  object_to_transform: the contiguous_block of non_white pixels
  direction: right
  distance: 1 pixel
  details: The entire block moves as one unit. The position vacated by the leftmost pixel of the block becomes white (0). The position to the right of the original rightmost pixel of the block is replaced by the rightmost pixel of the shifted block.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input row. Note its color, starting position (index), and ending position (index).
2.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initialized with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Copy the identified block of non-white pixels into the output row, but start it one position (index + 1) to the right compared to its starting position in the input row.

import numpy as np # Although not strictly necessary, numpy might be useful for more complex grid ops
