  type: shift
  object_to_transform: the horizontal_segment object
  direction: right
  distance: 1 column
  details:
    - The transformation applies only to the single row of the grid.
    - The segment retains its color and length.
    - The segment's start_column_index increases by 1.
    - The background color (white) fills the original starting position of the segment.
