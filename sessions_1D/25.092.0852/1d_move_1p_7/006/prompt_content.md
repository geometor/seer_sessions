"""
Identifies the single contiguous block of non-background (non-white, color 0) 
colored pixels in the input row (a 1xN grid). Creates an output grid of the 
same dimensions, initially filled with the background color. Shifts (translates) 
the identified block one position horizontally to the right within the output grid. 
Vacated space is filled with the background color (which happens automatically 
by initializing the output grid with the background color). The color and length 
of the block are preserved.

    Finds the start index, end index, and color of the first contiguous 
    block of non-background color in a 1D list (row).
