task_description: Shift a single horizontal block one step right in a 1D grid.
grid_properties:
  input_output_size_match: true
  input_height: 1
  input_width: 7
  output_height: 1
  output_width: 7
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - object_type: contiguous_block # A single horizontal line segment
    properties:
      shape: horizontal_line
      # Color varies (green or red in examples)
      # Length is consistently 3 in examples, but might vary in tests
    count: 1 # Always one block per grid
transformation:
  type: translation
  object_reference: the single non-background block
  details:
    direction: right
    distance: 1 pixel
  output_generation:
    - Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.
    - Identify the non-background block in the input (color, start index, end index).
    - Calculate the new start index by adding 1 to the original start index.
    - Copy the block (using its original color and length) into the output grid starting at the new start index, respecting grid boundaries.
