Okay, analyzing the provided example:

**Input:**

```
0 3 3 3 0 0 0
```


**Output:**

```
0 0 3 3 3 0 0
```


**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 1-dimensional grids (single rows) of the same length (7 pixels).
2.  **Colors Present:** The input uses white (0) and green (3). The output also uses only white (0) and green (3).
3.  **Objects:** The input contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels: a green block `[3, 3, 3]`. The remaining pixels are white, acting as a background.
4.  **Transformation:** The green block appears to have moved horizontally. In the input, it starts at index 1. In the output, it starts at index 2. This indicates a shift of one position to the right.
5.  **Background Interaction:** The position originally occupied by the start of the green block (index 1) becomes white in the output. The positions to the right of the original block remain white.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
grid_dimensions:
  input_height: 1
  input_width: 7
  output_height: 1
  output_width: 7
colors_present:
  - 0 # white
  - 3 # green
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: 3 # green
    pixels_input: [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3]] # Assuming 0-based indexing for row, column
    pixels_output: [[0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4]]
    shape: horizontal_line
    length: 3
actions:
  - action: shift
    object_color: 3 # green
    direction: right
    distance: 1 pixel
background_color: 0 # white
relationship:
  - The non-background object is translated one unit horizontally to the right.
  - The grid size remains constant.
  - Vacated space is filled with the background color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the background color (white, 0).
2.  Locate the single contiguous block of non-background colored pixels in the input row.
3.  Determine the starting and ending indices of this block.
4.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
5.  Copy the identified block of non-background pixels from the input row into the output row, but shifted one position to the right (i.e., place the first pixel of the block at index `start_index + 1`). Ensure the copied block does not extend beyond the grid boundaries (though in this specific example, it does not).
