The output also uses only white (0) and green (3).\n3.  **Objects:** The input contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels: a green block `[3, 3, 3]`. The remaining pixels are white, acting as a background.\n4.  **Transformation:** The green block appears to have moved horizontally. In the input, it starts at index 1. In the output, it starts at index 2. This indicates a shift of one position to the right.\n5.  **Background Interaction:** The position originally occupied by the start of the green block (index 1) becomes white in the output. The positions to the right of the original block remain white.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Copy the identified block of non-background pixels from the input row into the output row, but shifted one position to the right (i.e., place the first pixel of the block at index `start_index + 1`). Ensure the copied block does not extend beyond the grid boundaries (though in this specific example, it does not)."
