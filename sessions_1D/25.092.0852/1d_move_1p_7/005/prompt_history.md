Okay, analyzing the provided example:

**Input:**

```
0 3 3 3 0 0 0
```


**Output:**

```
0 0 3 3 3 0 0
```


**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 1-dimensional grids (single rows) of the same length (7 pixels).
2.  **Colors Present:** The input uses white (0) and green (3). The output also uses only white (0) and green (3).
3.  **Objects:** The input contains a single contiguous block of non-white pixels: a green block `[3, 3, 3]`. The remaining pixels are white, acting as a background.
4.  **Transformation:** The green block appears to have moved horizontally. In the input, it starts at index 1. In the output, it starts at index 2. This indicates a shift of one position to the right.
5.  **Background Interaction:** The position originally occupied by the start of the green block (index 1) becomes white in the output. The positions to the right of the original block remain white.

**YAML Facts:**

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the background color (white, 0).
2.  Locate the single contiguous block of non-background colored pixels in the input row.
3.  Determine the starting and ending indices of this block.
4.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
5.  Copy the identified block of non-background pixels from the input row into the output row, but shifted one position to the right (i.e., place the first pixel of the block at index `start_index + 1`). Ensure the copied block does not extend beyond the grid boundaries (though in this specific example, it does not).

**Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code aimed to implement a rightward shift of a single contiguous block of non-background color in a 1xN grid. However, the execution results show that for all three training examples, the transformed output was identical to the input, indicating a failure in applying the intended transformation. The transformation logic, as described in the natural language program and implemented in the Python code (specifically the loop placing the shifted block into the `output_row`), appears correct upon manual tracing for the described task (shift right by 1).

The discrepancy between the traced logic and the execution report suggests either:
1.  An error in the execution environment or how the function was called/results were reported.
2.  A subtle flaw in the code's handling of edge cases or variable scopes not apparent in the initial trace (though unlikely given the code's simplicity and the use of `copy.deepcopy` for safety).
3.  The initial observation, while seemingly consistent, might be missing a nuance, although a simple right shift fits all examples perfectly.

**Strategy:**
Assuming the core logic (find block, create background, place shifted block) is the intended transformation based on visual inspection of all examples, the focus should be on ensuring the natural language program clearly defines this. We will re-verify the properties using code execution and then refine the program description. We will proceed with the hypothesis that the intended transformation *is* a single right shift of the non-background block.

  - type: contiguous_block
    color: variable (green(3) or red(2))
    shape: horizontal_line
    length: 3 pixels
    location_input: variable start index (0 or 1)
    location_output: input_start_index + 1
actions:
  - action: horizontal_translation
    object: the single contiguous non-background block
    direction: right
    distance: 1 pixel
    result:
      - The block occupies new positions shifted one index to the right.
      - Positions previously occupied only by the start of the block become background color.
      - All other background pixels remain background color.
boundary_conditions:
  - Assumes the block does not hit the right boundary after shifting (true for examples).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Assume the input is a single row (1xN grid).
2.  Identify the background color, which is white (0).
3.  Locate the single contiguous block (horizontal line) of non-background colored pixels within the input row. Determine its color, start index, and end index.
4.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
5.  Determine the new start index for the block in the output row by adding 1 to the original start index.
6.  Copy the sequence of pixels forming the original block (using its original color) into the output row, starting at the calculated new start index. Ensure that copying stops if the end of the output row is reached.
7.  Return the new output row wrapped in a list to represent the 1xN grid.
