            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code attempted to implement the observed transformation: shifting a single contiguous block of non-background color one step to the right within a 1D grid. However, it failed with a \"list index out of range\" error on all training examples. Manual tracing suggests the core logic, including boundary checks, should handle the provided examples correctly. This discrepancy indicates either a subtle bug in the implementation (potentially in the helper function `find_contiguous_block` or its interaction with the main loop) or an issue with how the code was executed or the inputs were handled in the testing environment.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Re-verify the transformation rule using all examples.\n2.  Refine the helper function (`find_contiguous_block`) to be more robust in identifying the single contiguous block.\n3.  Gather precise metrics about the block's position and size in each example using code execution to confirm assumptions.\n4.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program based on this refined understanding.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's define the revised helper function and use it to extract information about the block in each training example.\n\n"
