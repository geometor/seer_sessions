grid_properties:
  input_shape: [1, 7] # height, width
  output_shape: [1, 7]
  background_color: 0 # white
consistency:
  - Grid shape remains constant between input and output.
  - Only one contiguous block of non-background color exists in the input.
  - The color of the block is preserved in the output.
  - The length of the block is preserved in the output.
  - The background color remains white (0).
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: variable (green(3) or red(2))
    shape: horizontal_line
    length: 3 pixels
    location_input: variable start index (0 or 1)
    location_output: input_start_index + 1
actions:
  - action: horizontal_translation
    object: the single contiguous non-background block
    direction: right
    distance: 1 pixel
    result:
      - The block occupies new positions shifted one index to the right.
      - Positions previously occupied only by the start of the block become background color.
      - All other background pixels remain background color.
boundary_conditions:
  - Assumes the block does not hit the right boundary after shifting (true for examples).
