            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** All examples consist of a single input grid and a corresponding single output grid. Both input and output grids are one-dimensional rows (1 row x N columns). In these specific examples, the grids are 1x27.\n2.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0) as the background color. Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (red (2) in example 1, orange (7) in example 2, blue (1) in example 3).\n3.  **Transformation:** By comparing the input and output grids in each example, I observe a consistent shift.\n    *   In example 1, the block of red pixels shifts one position to the right. The rightmost white pixel from the input appears at the leftmost position in the output.\n    *   In example 2, the block of orange pixels shifts one position to the right. The rightmost white pixel from the input appears at the leftmost position in the output.\n    *   In example 3, the block of blue pixels shifts one position to the right. The rightmost white pixel from the input appears at the leftmost position in the output.\n4.  **Pattern Identification:** The transformation appears to be a circular shift (or rotation) of the entire input row to the right by exactly one position. The element at the last index moves to the first index, and all other elements shift one index to the right.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
