Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** All examples consist of a single input grid and a corresponding single output grid. Both input and output grids are one-dimensional rows (1 row x N columns). In these specific examples, the grids are 1x27.
2.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0) as the background color. Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color (red (2) in example 1, orange (7) in example 2, blue (1) in example 3).
3.  **Transformation:** By comparing the input and output grids in each example, I observe a consistent shift.
    *   In example 1, the block of red pixels shifts one position to the right. The rightmost white pixel from the input appears at the leftmost position in the output.
    *   In example 2, the block of orange pixels shifts one position to the right. The rightmost white pixel from the input appears at the leftmost position in the output.
    *   In example 3, the block of blue pixels shifts one position to the right. The rightmost white pixel from the input appears at the leftmost position in the output.
4.  **Pattern Identification:** The transformation appears to be a circular shift (or rotation) of the entire input row to the right by exactly one position. The element at the last index moves to the first index, and all other elements shift one index to the right.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (row vector)
  size: 1x27 (constant across examples)
  colors_present:
    - 0 (white)
    - A single non-white color per example (e.g., 1, 2, 7)
objects:
  - type: background
    color: 0 (white)
    description: Fills the space not occupied by the non-white block.
  - type: block
    color: non-white (variable)
    shape: contiguous horizontal segment
    count: 1 per grid
transformation:
  type: circular_shift
  direction: right
  amount: 1 position
  target: entire_grid_row
relationship:
  input_output: The output grid is the result of applying a one-position right circular shift to the input grid row.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input grid, which is a single row of pixels.
2.  Perform a circular shift of all pixels in the row one position to the right.
3.  To achieve this:
    *   Take the pixel value from the last position (rightmost column) of the input row.
    *   Place this value into the first position (leftmost column) of the output row.
    *   Shift all pixel values from the input row, starting from the first position up to the second-to-last position, one position to the right in the output row.
4.  The resulting row is the output grid.
