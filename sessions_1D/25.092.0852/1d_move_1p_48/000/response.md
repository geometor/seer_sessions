*   **Perception:** The task involves processing single-row grids (1D arrays). Each input grid contains a background of white pixels (0) and a single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels. The color and length of this segment vary between examples. The transformation consistently involves changing the position of the non-white segment within the row. In all provided examples, the segment shifts exactly one position to the right. The color and length of the segment remain unchanged.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
    background_color: white (0)
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
        count: 1
        properties:
          - color: non-white (varies per example: yellow, gray, orange)
          - length: variable (3, 6, 9 in examples)
          - position: start and end index in the row
    transformation:
      - action: identify_object
        target: the single non-white segment
      - action: shift_object
        direction: right
        distance: 1 position
        constraints:
          - preserve_color
          - preserve_length
    output_grid:
      - maintains_dimensions: yes (same as input row length)
      - background_color: white (0)
      - content: the shifted non-white segment
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels within the input row. Note its color, length, and starting position.
    2.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input, initially filled with white pixels.
    3.  Copy the identified segment (preserving its color and length) into the output row, but position it so that it starts one index to the right of its original starting position in the input row.
