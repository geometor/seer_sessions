Each input grid contains a background of white pixels (0) and a single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels. The color and length of this segment vary between examples. The transformation consistently involves changing the position of the non-white segment within the row. In all provided examples, the segment shifts exactly one position to the right. The color and length of the segment remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
