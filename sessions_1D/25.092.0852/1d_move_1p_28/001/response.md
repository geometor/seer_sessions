"""
Shifts a horizontal block of non-white pixels one position to the right
within a 1D row (represented as a 1xN grid). The background is white (0).
The color and length of the block remain unchanged. The position originally
occupied by the leftmost pixel of the block becomes white, and the white
pixel immediately to the right of the original block's rightmost end takes
on the block's color.
