task_description: "Shift a horizontal block of non-white pixels one position to the right within a 1D row."
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1 # Effectively 1D, presented as 1xN
  size_relation: "Output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid."
objects:
  - object_type: block
    description: "A single contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels."
    properties:
      color: "Any non-white color (varies per example)."
      length: "Variable length."
      position: "Defined by its start and end indices in the row."
    count: 1
  - object_type: background
    description: "The surrounding pixels."
    properties:
      color: white (0)
actions:
  - action_type: shift
    target_object: block
    details:
      direction: right
      distance: 1 pixel
      effect: "The entire block moves one position to the right. The leftmost original position becomes white, the position to the right of the original block takes the block's color."
relationships:
  - type: containment
    description: "The non-white block is contained within the white background."
  - type: transformation_invariance
    description: "The color and length of the non-white block remain unchanged after the shift."
