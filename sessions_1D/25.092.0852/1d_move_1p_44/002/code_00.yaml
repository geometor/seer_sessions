task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 2D # Input/output are 2D numpy arrays
grid_size_relation: input_shape == output_shape
input_structure: contains exactly one row
output_structure: contains exactly one row
objects:
  - type: colored_block
    color: non-white (variable, e.g., orange, green, azure)
    location_input_row: contiguous segment starting at index 0
    location_output_row: contiguous segment starting at index 1
    properties: length is preserved
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    location_input_row: follows the colored_block
    location_output_row: occupies index 0 and follows the colored_block
actions:
  - action: extract_row
    target: input_grid
    details: Select the first (index 0) row for processing.
  - action: shift_right
    target: elements of the extracted row
    details: Shift all elements one position to the right, discarding the last element.
  - action: insert
    target: extracted row (after shift)
    location: index 0
    value: white (0)
  - action: reconstruct_grid
    target: transformed row
    details: Place the transformed row into a 2D array structure matching the input shape.
relationships:
  - The non-white block is always at the beginning of the input row.
  - The length of the non-white block determines its extent in the output row.
  - The color of the non-white block is preserved.
  - The overall grid dimensions (shape) are preserved.
