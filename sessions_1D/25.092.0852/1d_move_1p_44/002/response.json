            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code failed because it likely assumed the input `input_grid` was a 1D list or directly iterable into its elements. However, the execution results (`[0]`) strongly suggest the input was treated as a structure containing a single element (perhaps a 2D NumPy array with one row), leading to incorrect length calculation and loop execution.\n\nThe core logic identified (shifting the initial non-white block right by one, prepending a white pixel, and maintaining length) appears correct based on the examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Assume Input Format:** Assume the `input_grid` provided to the `transform` function is a 2D NumPy array, even for visually 1D examples (i.e., shape `(1, N)`).\n2.  **Extract Row:** Modify the code to explicitly select the first (and only) row from the input array.\n3.  **Apply Logic:** Apply the previously determined shifting logic to this extracted row.\n4.  **Format Output:** Ensure the output is returned in the same format as the input (a 2D NumPy array containing the transformed row).\n5.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the facts and natural language program to reflect the handling of the 2D array structure.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nLet's verify the assumption about the input format causing the error. We simulate passing a 2D NumPy array to the original code.\n\n"

When the input is a 2D NumPy array of shape `(1, N)`, `list(input_grid)` creates a list containing one element: the NumPy array representing the row. `len()` is therefore 1, the loop `range(0)` doesn't run, and the function returns `[0]`.
