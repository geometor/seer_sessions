*   **Perception:** The task operates on 1D grids (rows). Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color starting at the leftmost position, followed by white pixels (0) filling the rest of the row. The transformation involves shifting this non-white block one position to the right. The first position becomes white (0), and the last pixel of the original input is effectively removed to maintain the same grid length.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D
    grid_size_relation: input_length == output_length
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_block
        color: non-white (variable, e.g., orange, green, azure)
        location_input: starts at index 0
        location_output: starts at index 1
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
        location_input: fills the grid after the non-white block
        location_output: occupies index 0 and fills the grid after the non-white block
    actions:
      - action: shift_right
        target: non-white block
        details: Shifted by 1 position.
      - action: insert
        target: white pixel (0)
        location: index 0
      - action: maintain_size
        details: The overall length of the grid remains constant, implying the last element is dropped during the shift.
    relationships:
      - The non-white block is always followed by white pixels in the input.
      - The length of the non-white block is preserved.
      - The color of the non-white block is preserved.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels starting from the first position (index 0) in the input row.
    2.  Determine the length of this non-white block.
    3.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row.
    4.  Set the first element (index 0) of the output row to white (0).
    5.  Copy the identified non-white block from the input row to the output row, starting at the second position (index 1).
    6.  Fill the remaining positions in the output row (if any, after the copied block) with white (0) pixels.
