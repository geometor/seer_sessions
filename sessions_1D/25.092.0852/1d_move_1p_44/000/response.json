Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color starting at the leftmost position, followed by white pixels (0) filling the rest of the row. The transformation involves shifting this non-white block one position to the right. The first position becomes white (0), and the last pixel of the original input is effectively removed to maintain the same grid length.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
