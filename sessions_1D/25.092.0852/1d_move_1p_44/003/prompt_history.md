*   **Perception:** The task operates on 1D grids (rows). Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-white color starting at the leftmost position, followed by white pixels (0) filling the rest of the row. The transformation involves shifting this non-white block one position to the right. The first position becomes white (0), and the last pixel of the original input is effectively removed to maintain the same grid length.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    grid_dimensionality: 1D
    grid_size_relation: input_length == output_length
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_block
        color: non-white (variable, e.g., orange, green, azure)
        location_input: starts at index 0
        location_output: starts at index 1
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
        location_input: fills the grid after the non-white block
        location_output: occupies index 0 and fills the grid after the non-white block
    actions:
      - action: shift_right
        target: non-white block
        details: Shifted by 1 position.
      - action: insert
        target: white pixel (0)
        location: index 0
      - action: maintain_size
        details: The overall length of the grid remains constant, implying the last element is dropped during the shift.
    relationships:
      - The non-white block is always followed by white pixels in the input.
      - The length of the non-white block is preserved.
      - The color of the non-white block is preserved.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-white pixels starting from the first position (index 0) in the input row.
    2.  Determine the length of this non-white block.
    3.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row.
    4.  Set the first element (index 0) of the output row to white (0).
    5.  Copy the identified non-white block from the input row to the output row, starting at the second position (index 1).
    6.  Fill the remaining positions in the output row (if any, after the copied block) with white (0) pixels.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code failed because it likely assumed the input `input_grid` was a 1D list or directly iterable into its elements. However, the execution results (`[0]`) strongly suggest the input was treated as a structure containing a single element (perhaps a 2D NumPy array with one row), leading to incorrect length calculation and loop execution.

The core logic identified (shifting the initial non-white block right by one, prepending a white pixel, and maintaining length) appears correct based on the examples.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Assume Input Format:** Assume the `input_grid` provided to the `transform` function is a 2D NumPy array, even for visually 1D examples (i.e., shape `(1, N)`).
2.  **Extract Row:** Modify the code to explicitly select the first (and only) row from the input array.
3.  **Apply Logic:** Apply the previously determined shifting logic to this extracted row.
4.  **Format Output:** Ensure the output is returned in the same format as the input (a 2D NumPy array containing the transformed row).
5.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the facts and natural language program to reflect the handling of the 2D array structure.

## Metrics and Verification

Let's verify the assumption about the input format causing the error. We simulate passing a 2D NumPy array to the original code.



*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

# Original code provided in the previous step
def original_transform(input_grid):
    input_list = list(input_grid)
    grid_length = len(input_list)
    output_list = [0] * grid_length
    for i in range(grid_length - 1):
        output_list[i + 1] = input_list[i]
    output_list[0] = 0
    return output_list

# Simulate inputs as 2D numpy arrays
input_1 = np.array([[7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
input_2 = np.array([[3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
input_3 = np.array([[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

output_1 = original_transform(input_1)
output_2 = original_transform(input_2)
output_3 = original_transform(input_3)

print(f"Input 1 shape: {input_1.shape}")
print(f"Simulated Output 1: {output_1}")
print(f"Input 2 shape: {input_2.shape}")
print(f"Simulated Output 2: {output_2}")
print(f"Input 3 shape: {input_3.shape}")
print(f"Simulated Output 3: {output_3}")
```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
Input 1 shape: (1, 7)
Simulated Output 1: [0]
Input 2 shape: (1, 7)
Simulated Output 2: [0]
Input 3 shape: (1, 7)
Simulated Output 3: [0]

```
**Findings:**
The simulation confirms the hypothesis. When the input is a 2D NumPy array of shape `(1, N)`, `list(input_grid)` creates a list containing one element: the NumPy array representing the row. `len()` is therefore 1, the loop `range(0)` doesn't run, and the function returns `[0]`. This matches the erroneous results observed.

The input grids are indeed 2D arrays, even if they only contain one row. The transformation logic operates *on that single row*.

## Updated YAML Facts

grid_size_relation: input_shape == output_shape
input_structure: contains exactly one row
output_structure: contains exactly one row
objects:
  - type: colored_block
    color: non-white (variable, e.g., orange, green, azure)
    location_input_row: contiguous segment starting at index 0
    location_output_row: contiguous segment starting at index 1
    properties: length is preserved
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    location_input_row: follows the colored_block
    location_output_row: occupies index 0 and follows the colored_block
actions:
  - action: extract_row
    target: input_grid
    details: Select the first (index 0) row for processing.
  - action: shift_right
    target: elements of the extracted row
    details: Shift all elements one position to the right, discarding the last element.
  - action: insert
    target: extracted row (after shift)
    location: index 0
    value: white (0)
  - action: reconstruct_grid
    target: transformed row
    details: Place the transformed row into a 2D array structure matching the input shape.
relationships:
  - The non-white block is always at the beginning of the input row.
  - The length of the non-white block determines its extent in the output row.
  - The color of the non-white block is preserved.
  - The overall grid dimensions (shape) are preserved.
```


## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid, which is a 2D array containing a single row.
2.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input grid. Let its length be `N`.
3.  Create a new row of length `N`, initially filled with a placeholder or the background color (white, 0).
4.  Set the first element (index 0) of the new row to white (0).
5.  Copy the elements from the *extracted input row* starting from index 0 up to index `N-2` into the *new row*, starting at index 1. (This effectively shifts the first `N-1` elements of the input row one position to the right).
6.  Construct the output grid as a 2D array containing only the newly created transformed row. Ensure the output grid has the same shape as the input grid.
