task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 2D # Input is likely a 2D NumPy array, specifically 1xN
grid_representation: numpy_array
color_focus: single_non_background_color
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal run of pixels of the same non-white color within the single row of the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., gray-5, orange-7, azure-8).
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - start_col_index: The starting column index of the segment.
      - end_col_index: The ending column index of the segment.
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    description: Comparing the lengths of different segments of the same non-white color.
  - type: selection
    description: Selecting the segment with the maximum length. If ties occur, the examples implicitly suggest keeping only one, potentially the first encountered or based on sorting criteria (longest first).
actions:
  - input_preprocessing: Assume input is a 2D NumPy array `input_grid` with shape (1, N). Extract the single row for processing: `row_array = input_grid[0]`.
  - identify_color: Determine the single non-white color present in `row_array`.
  - find_segments: Scan `row_array` horizontally to locate all contiguous segments of the identified non-white color. Record the start column index, end column index, and length of each segment.
  - measure_length: Calculate the length of each found segment.
  - find_longest: Identify the segment(s) with the maximum length from the list of found segments.
  - filter: Select only the segment corresponding to the maximum length. (Handle ties by selecting the first one found after sorting by length descending).
  - output_generation: Create a new output grid (2D NumPy array) of the same shape as the input, initialized with the background color (0).
  - paint_segment: Copy the pixels belonging to the selected longest segment (using its start/end indices and the non-white color) into the corresponding positions in the output grid's single row.
output_composition:
  - background: All white (0) pixels.
  - foreground: Pixels corresponding only to the single longest horizontal segment of the non-white color from the input row, preserved in their original column positions within the output grid's single row.
