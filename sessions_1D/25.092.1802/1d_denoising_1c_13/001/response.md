"""
Identify the single non-white color present in the 1D input grid.
Find all contiguous horizontal segments (runs) of this non-white color.
Determine the length of each segment.
Select the segment with the maximum length. If there are multiple segments with the same maximum length, the examples don't show this case, but a reasonable assumption is to keep the first one encountered or potentially all of them (although the examples suggest only one is kept). Based on the examples, we will keep only the single longest segment.
Create an output grid of the same size, initially filled with white (0).
Copy only the pixels corresponding to the longest segment into the output grid at the same position.
All other pixels in the output grid remain white (0).
