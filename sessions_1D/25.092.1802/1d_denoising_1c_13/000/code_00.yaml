task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Based on provided format, potentially 1xN
color_focus: single_non_background_color
objects:
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal run of pixels of the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., gray, orange, azure).
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - start_index: The starting position of the segment.
      - end_index: The ending position of the segment.
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    description: Comparing the lengths of different segments of the same color within the input.
  - type: selection
    description: Selecting the segment with the maximum length.
actions:
  - identify_color: Determine the single non-white color present in the input.
  - find_segments: Locate all contiguous horizontal segments of the identified non-white color.
  - measure_length: Calculate the length of each found segment.
  - find_longest: Identify the segment(s) with the maximum length.
  - filter: Keep only the pixels belonging to the longest segment.
  - replace: Change all other pixels (including shorter segments of the non-white color and the original background pixels not part of the longest segment) to white (0).
output_composition:
  - background: All white (0) pixels.
  - foreground: Pixels corresponding only to the single longest horizontal segment of the non-white color from the input, preserved in their original position.
