All examples have a length of 31.\n2.  **Color Palette:** Each example uses only two colors: white (0) and one other color (gray-5, orange-7, or azure-8).\n3.  **Input Pattern:** The non-white color appears in multiple locations in the input. These occurrences can be single pixels or contiguous horizontal runs (segments) of varying lengths.\n4.  **Output Pattern:** The output retains only *one* contiguous horizontal segment of the non-white color from the input. All other pixels, including other segments or isolated pixels of that same non-white color, are turned white (0).\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation seems to identify all contiguous horizontal segments of the non-white color, measure their lengths, find the longest segment, and keep *only* that segment, removing all other instances of that color. The position of the longest segment is preserved.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
