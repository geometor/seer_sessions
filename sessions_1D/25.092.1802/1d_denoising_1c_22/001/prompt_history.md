Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The examples provided seem to represent 1D arrays or vectors, rather than the typical 2D grids of ARC tasks. Each example pair shows an input vector and an output vector of the same length (32 elements in these cases).
2.  **Colors:** Each input array uses two colors: a background color (white, 0) and a single 'foreground' or 'primary' color (red 2, blue 1, or yellow 4, depending on the example). The output array uses the same two colors.
3.  **Input Structure:** The primary color in the input appears in multiple locations. There is always one relatively long contiguous block (segment) of the primary color. Additionally, there are other, smaller segments or individual pixels of the primary color scattered elsewhere in the array.
4.  **Output Structure:** The output array contains only *one* contiguous block of the primary color. All other positions are filled with the background color (white, 0).
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to isolate the *largest* contiguous block of the primary color found in the input. The position and color of this largest block are preserved in the output. All other pixels in the input, including the background pixels and any primary color pixels *not* part of the largest block, are replaced with the background color in the output.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation_1d
description: Isolate the single largest contiguous block of the non-background color within a 1D array.

input_features:
  - element: array_1d
    properties:
      dimensionality: 1
      size: variable (32 in examples)
      value_type: integer (color code 0-9)
      contains:
        - background_color: white (0)
        - primary_color: single non-zero color (e.g., red, blue, yellow)
          distribution: multiple contiguous blocks of varying lengths

output_features:
  - element: array_1d
    properties:
      dimensionality: 1
      size: same as input array
      value_type: integer (color code 0-9)
      contains:
        - background_color: white (0)
        - primary_color: same as input primary_color
          distribution: single contiguous block located at the position of the largest block from the input

transformation_logic:
  - action: identify_colors
    inputs: [input_array]
    outputs: [background_color, primary_color]
    description: Determine the background (0) and the single non-zero primary color.
  - action: find_contiguous_blocks
    inputs: [input_array, primary_color]
    outputs: [list_of_blocks] # Each block represented by {start_index, end_index, length}
    description: Locate all contiguous segments of the primary color.
  - action: find_largest_block
    inputs: [list_of_blocks]
    outputs: [largest_block]
    description: Identify the block with the maximum length from the list. Assume uniqueness or select any one if tied.
  - action: generate_output_array
    inputs: [input_array_size, background_color, largest_block, primary_color]
    outputs: [output_array]
    description: Create an array filled with the background color, then place the primary color pixels at the indices defined by the largest_block.

relationships:
  - identity: Size of the output array is identical to the size of the input array.
  - identity: The primary color in the output is identical to the primary color in the input.
  - correspondence: The position (start and end indices) of the primary color block in the output matches the position of the largest primary color block in the input.
  - filtering: All pixels in the input that are *not* part of the largest contiguous block of the primary color are mapped to the background color in the output.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output array to be the same size as the input array, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the primary color, which is the single non-white color present in the input array.
3.  Iterate through the input array to find all contiguous segments (blocks) composed solely of the primary color. For each segment found, record its starting index, ending index, and length.
4.  Compare the lengths of all identified segments and determine which segment is the longest. Let this be the "largest segment".
5.  Iterate from the starting index to the ending index (inclusive) of the largest segment. For each index in this range, set the corresponding element in the output array to the primary color.
6.  Return the completed output array.
