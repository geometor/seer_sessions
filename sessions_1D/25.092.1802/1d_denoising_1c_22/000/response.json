            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** The examples provided seem to represent 1D arrays or vectors, rather than the typical 2D grids of ARC tasks. Each example pair shows an input vector and an output vector of the same length (32 elements in these cases).\n2.  **Colors:** Each input array uses two colors: a background color (white, 0) and a single 'foreground' or 'primary' color (red 2, blue 1, or yellow 4, depending on the example). The output array uses the same two colors.\n3.  **Input Structure:** The primary color in the input appears in multiple locations. There is always one relatively long contiguous block (segment) of the primary color. Additionally, there are other, smaller segments or individual pixels of the primary color scattered elsewhere in the array.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output array contains only *one* contiguous block of the primary color. All other positions are filled with the background color (white, 0).\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to isolate the *largest* contiguous block of the primary color found in the input. The position and color of this largest block are preserved in the output. All other pixels in the input, including the background pixels and any primary color pixels *not* part of the largest block, are replaced with the background color in the output.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
