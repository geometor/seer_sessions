*   **Perception of task elements**:
    *   The task operates on 1-dimensional grids (or single rows).
    *   Each grid contains white pixels (0) and pixels of one other color (orange 7, green 3, gray 5).
    *   The non-white pixels appear in contiguous horizontal segments of varying lengths, separated by white pixels.
    *   The transformation seems to isolate the *longest* contiguous segment of the non-white color present in the input.
    *   All other pixels in the output grid, including those that were part of shorter non-white segments in the input, become white (0).

*   **YAML Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: object_selection
    grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1xN grids
    background_color: white (0)
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
        properties:
          - color: non-white (varies per example: 7, 3, 5)
          - length: integer > 0
    input_features:
      - multiple contiguous segments of a single non-white color
      - segments separated by white pixels
    output_features:
      - only one contiguous segment of the non-white color remains
      - all other pixels are white
    transformation:
      action: select_largest_object
      criteria: maximum_length
      target: contiguous_horizontal_segments_of_non_white_color
      result: keep_largest_segment
      cleanup: convert_other_pixels_to_background_color (white)
    relationship: The output grid contains only the longest contiguous segment of the non-white color found in the input grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the primary non-white color present in the input grid.
    2.  Scan the input grid horizontally to find all contiguous segments composed solely of this non-white color.
    3.  Determine the length (number of pixels) of each identified segment.
    4.  Find the segment with the maximum length. If there's a tie for the maximum length, any one of the longest segments can be chosen (though the examples don't explicitly show ties).
    5.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
    6.  Copy the pixels corresponding to the longest identified segment from the input grid to the same positions in the output grid.
    7.  Ensure all other positions in the output grid are set to the background color (white, 0).
