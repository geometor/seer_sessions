            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\nThe task involves processing grids containing a background color (white, 0) and a primary object composed of a single non-white color (green, red, or magenta in the examples). The object generally has a main structure, often resembling a 'T' shape with a horizontal bar and a vertical stem, potentially with some scattered pixels of the same color elsewhere. The transformation isolates a specific part of this main object. Observing the input and output pairs, the output consistently retains only the longest continuous horizontal segment of the primary colored object from the input. All other pixels, including other parts of the object and any scattered pixels, are changed to the background color (white). The position (row index) and color of the extracted horizontal segment remain the same as in the input.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

If multiple segments have the same maximum length, the examples provided only show one longest segment, suggesting uniqueness or perhaps selecting the topmost one if ambiguity arose (though not demonstrated).\n# - Filter/Extract: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input.\n# - Populate: Fill the new grid with the background color (white).\n# - Transfer: Copy the pixels belonging *only* to the selected longest horizontal segment from the input grid to the new grid, maintaining their original color and position (row and column indices).\n\n# Result:\n# - The output grid contains only the longest horizontal segment of the primary colored object from the input, set against a white background.\n```"
