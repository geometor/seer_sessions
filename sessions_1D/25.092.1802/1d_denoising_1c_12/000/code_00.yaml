# Perceptual Schema for ARC Task

# Grid Properties:
# - Size: Variable (example grids are 1x32)
# - Background Color: Consistently white (0)

# Objects:
# - Input contains one primary 'object' composed of a single non-white color (e.g., green=3, red=2, magenta=6).
# - This object may have a complex shape, often including a prominent horizontal bar and other connected or disconnected components.
# - The output contains only a subset of the input object's pixels.

# Relationships & Properties:
# - Connectivity: Pixels of the primary color form contiguous segments/regions.
# - Dominance: The non-white color constitutes the 'foreground' or 'object' against the white background.
# - Geometry: The key feature extracted is a horizontal line segment.

# Actions/Transformations:
# - Identify: Find the dominant non-white color in the input.
# - Locate: Scan the input grid to find all continuous horizontal segments (runs) of the identified color.
# - Measure: Determine the length of each horizontal segment.
# - Select: Choose the longest horizontal segment found. If multiple segments have the same maximum length, the examples provided only show one longest segment, suggesting uniqueness or perhaps selecting the topmost one if ambiguity arose (though not demonstrated).
# - Filter/Extract: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input.
# - Populate: Fill the new grid with the background color (white).
# - Transfer: Copy the pixels belonging *only* to the selected longest horizontal segment from the input grid to the new grid, maintaining their original color and position (row and column indices).

# Result:
# - The output grid contains only the longest horizontal segment of the primary colored object from the input, set against a white background.
