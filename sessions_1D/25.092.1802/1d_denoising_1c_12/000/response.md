Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

The task involves processing grids containing a background color (white, 0) and a primary object composed of a single non-white color (green, red, or magenta in the examples). The object generally has a main structure, often resembling a 'T' shape with a horizontal bar and a vertical stem, potentially with some scattered pixels of the same color elsewhere. The transformation isolates a specific part of this main object. Observing the input and output pairs, the output consistently retains only the longest continuous horizontal segment of the primary colored object from the input. All other pixels, including other parts of the object and any scattered pixels, are changed to the background color (white). The position (row index) and color of the extracted horizontal segment remain the same as in the input.

**Facts:**


```yaml
# Perceptual Schema for ARC Task

# Grid Properties:
# - Size: Variable (example grids are 1x32)
# - Background Color: Consistently white (0)

# Objects:
# - Input contains one primary 'object' composed of a single non-white color (e.g., green=3, red=2, magenta=6).
# - This object may have a complex shape, often including a prominent horizontal bar and other connected or disconnected components.
# - The output contains only a subset of the input object's pixels.

# Relationships & Properties:
# - Connectivity: Pixels of the primary color form contiguous segments/regions.
# - Dominance: The non-white color constitutes the 'foreground' or 'object' against the white background.
# - Geometry: The key feature extracted is a horizontal line segment.

# Actions/Transformations:
# - Identify: Find the dominant non-white color in the input.
# - Locate: Scan the input grid to find all continuous horizontal segments (runs) of the identified color.
# - Measure: Determine the length of each horizontal segment.
# - Select: Choose the longest horizontal segment found. If multiple segments have the same maximum length, the examples provided only show one longest segment, suggesting uniqueness or perhaps selecting the topmost one if ambiguity arose (though not demonstrated).
# - Filter/Extract: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input.
# - Populate: Fill the new grid with the background color (white).
# - Transfer: Copy the pixels belonging *only* to the selected longest horizontal segment from the input grid to the new grid, maintaining their original color and position (row and column indices).

# Result:
# - The output grid contains only the longest horizontal segment of the primary colored object from the input, set against a white background.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the primary non-white color present in the input grid.
3.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
4.  Within each row, identify all continuous horizontal segments (runs) composed of the primary non-white color.
5.  Keep track of the longest horizontal segment found across all rows so far, recording its starting column index, ending column index, row index, and color.
6.  After scanning all rows, identify the overall longest horizontal segment found.
7.  Copy the pixels corresponding to this longest segment (using its recorded start/end columns, row index, and color) into the corresponding positions in the output grid.
8.  Return the completed output grid.
