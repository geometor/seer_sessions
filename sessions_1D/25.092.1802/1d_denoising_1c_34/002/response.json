            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe error `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous` encountered previously strongly suggests that the input data, although visually representing a single row, is being passed to the `transform` function as a 2D structure (likely a list containing one list, e.g., `[[0, 0, 4, ...]]`, or a 2D NumPy array). The prior code incorrectly assumed a purely 1D input, leading to errors when NumPy operations returned boolean arrays instead of single boolean values in conditional checks.\n\nThe core logic identified \u2013 finding the longest contiguous horizontal block of the non-background color and replicating only that block in the output \u2013 appears correct based on the examples.\n\nThe strategy is to adapt the implementation to correctly handle the 2D input format (specifically, a 1xN grid). This involves:\n1.  Accepting a 2D structure (e.g., `List[List[int]]` or `np.ndarray`).\n2.  Explicitly selecting the single row containing the data (likely the first row).\n3.  Applying the block-finding logic to this extracted row.\n4.  Generating the output as a 2D structure of the same shape as the input, placing the largest block in the corresponding row.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nMetrics were gathered using `tool_code` execution, confirming the following structure and pattern for all training examples:\n\n*   **Input/Output Shape:** Consistently (1, 32) for all examples.\n*   **Colors:** Input contains white (0) and one primary color (4 or 5). Output contains only white (0) and that same primary color.\n*   **Primary Color:** Example 1: 4 (yellow), Example 2: 5 (gray), Example 3: 4 (yellow).\n*   **Horizontal Blocks (Input Row):**\n    *   Example 1: Blocks of color 4 with lengths [1, 1, 1, 1, 10, 1]. Largest: length 10, start=17, end=26.\n    *   Example 2: Blocks of color 5 with lengths [1, 11, 1]. Largest: length 11, start=4, end=14.\n    *   Example 3: Blocks of color 4 with lengths [1, 1, 1, 10, 1]. Largest: length 10, start=11, end=20.\n*   **Output Content:** The output grid precisely matches the position and color of the single largest horizontal block found in the input's row, with all other positions being white (0).\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
