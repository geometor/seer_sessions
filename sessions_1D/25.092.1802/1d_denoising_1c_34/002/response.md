**General Assessment and Strategy**

The error `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous` encountered previously strongly suggests that the input data, although visually representing a single row, is being passed to the `transform` function as a 2D structure (likely a list containing one list, e.g., `[[0, 0, 4, ...]]`, or a 2D NumPy array). The prior code incorrectly assumed a purely 1D input, leading to errors when NumPy operations returned boolean arrays instead of single boolean values in conditional checks.

The core logic identified – finding the longest contiguous horizontal block of the non-background color and replicating only that block in the output – appears correct based on the examples.

The strategy is to adapt the implementation to correctly handle the 2D input format (specifically, a 1xN grid). This involves:
1.  Accepting a 2D structure (e.g., `List[List[int]]` or `np.ndarray`).
2.  Explicitly selecting the single row containing the data (likely the first row).
3.  Applying the block-finding logic to this extracted row.
4.  Generating the output as a 2D structure of the same shape as the input, placing the largest block in the corresponding row.

**Metrics**

Metrics were gathered using `tool_code` execution, confirming the following structure and pattern for all training examples:

*   **Input/Output Shape:** Consistently (1, 32) for all examples.
*   **Colors:** Input contains white (0) and one primary color (4 or 5). Output contains only white (0) and that same primary color.
*   **Primary Color:** Example 1: 4 (yellow), Example 2: 5 (gray), Example 3: 4 (yellow).
*   **Horizontal Blocks (Input Row):**
    *   Example 1: Blocks of color 4 with lengths [1, 1, 1, 1, 10, 1]. Largest: length 10, start=17, end=26.
    *   Example 2: Blocks of color 5 with lengths [1, 11, 1]. Largest: length 11, start=4, end=14.
    *   Example 3: Blocks of color 4 with lengths [1, 1, 1, 10, 1]. Largest: length 10, start=11, end=20.
*   **Output Content:** The output grid precisely matches the position and color of the single largest horizontal block found in the input's row, with all other positions being white (0).

    input: grid row, primary_color
    output: list of all horizontal_blocks found in that row, described by their start_column, end_column, and length.
  - action: select_largest_block
    input: list of horizontal_blocks
    output: the single block with the greatest length. Returns null or equivalent if no blocks exist.
  - action: initialize_output_grid

    description: Create a new grid of identical dimensions, filled entirely with the background_color (white/0).
  - action: populate_output_with_block

    target: output grid's single row (corresponding to the input's active row)
    description: Set the pixels in the output grid's row, from the largest block's start_column to end_column (inclusive), to the primary_color. This action is skipped if no largest block was found.
relationship:
  - type: filtering_and_preservation
    based_on: horizontal_block length
    description: The transformation filters the input row's primary_color_pixels, preserving only those that constitute the single longest contiguous horizontal_block. These preserved pixels are placed in the corresponding row/columns of the output grid. All other pixels (background and non-largest blocks/pixels) are mapped to the background_color in the output.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input grid, which is a 2D grid containing a single row of pixels (dimensions 1xN).
2.  Determine the width (N) of the input grid.
3.  Create a new output grid of dimensions 1xN, initializing all pixels to the background color (white/0).
4.  Examine the input grid's single row to identify the primary non-white color used. If only the background color is present, return the initialized (all white) output grid.
5.  Iterate through the pixels of the input grid's row from left to right (column 0 to N-1).
6.  Identify all contiguous horizontal blocks (sequences) composed solely of the primary non-white color. For each block found, record its starting column index, ending column index, and calculate its length.
7.  If no blocks of the primary color were found, return the initialized (all white) output grid.
8.  Compare the lengths of all identified blocks and select the block with the maximum length. (Assume only one block will have the maximum length).
9.  Using the start column index, end column index, and the primary non-white color of the selected largest block, modify the output grid: For the range of columns from the start index to the end index (inclusive) in the output grid's single row, set the pixel color to the primary non-white color.
10. Return the modified output grid.
