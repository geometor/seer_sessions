task_description: Identify the single largest contiguous horizontal block of the non-background color within the input grid's single row, and create an output grid containing only this block at the same position, with all other pixels set to the background color.
elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D structure, specifically observed as having dimensions 1xN in all examples.
    contains: pixels arranged in a single row.
  - object: background_pixel
    color: white (0)
    role: default pixel value, fills most of the grid.
  - object: primary_color_pixel
    color: non-white (e.g., yellow=4, gray=5)
    role: constituent of patterns within the grid's row. Exists as single pixels or contiguous blocks.
  - object: horizontal_block
    definition: A contiguous sequence (run) of one or more primary_color_pixels located adjacent horizontally within the grid's single row.
    properties:
      - color: The primary color shared by pixels in the block.
      - start_column: The starting column index (0-based) of the block within the row.
      - end_column: The ending column index (0-based, inclusive) of the block within the row.
      - length: The number of pixels in the block (end_column - start_column + 1).
properties:
  - property: grid_dimensions
    applies_to: grid
    value: Constant shape (1, 32) for both input and output across examples.
  - property: color_palette
    applies_to: grid
    description: Contains exactly two colors - background (white/0) and one primary non-white color.
  - property: dominant_structure
    applies_to: output grid
    description: Contains at most one horizontal_block (the largest one from the input), otherwise entirely background_pixels.
  - property: uniqueness_of_largest_block
    applies_to: horizontal_block within input grid row
    description: Observed in examples that there is always a unique block with the maximum length.
actions:
  - action: identify_grid_properties
    input: input grid
    output: dimensions (height, width), primary non-white color.
  - action: extract_active_row
    input: input grid (1xN)
    output: the single row (1D array or list) containing pixel data.
  - action: find_horizontal_blocks_in_row
    input: grid row, primary_color
    output: list of all horizontal_blocks found in that row, described by their start_column, end_column, and length.
  - action: select_largest_block
    input: list of horizontal_blocks
    output: the single block with the greatest length. Returns null or equivalent if no blocks exist.
  - action: initialize_output_grid
    based_on: input grid dimensions
    description: Create a new grid of identical dimensions, filled entirely with the background_color (white/0).
  - action: populate_output_with_block
    input: largest block (start/end columns, primary color), output grid
    target: output grid's single row (corresponding to the input's active row)
    description: Set the pixels in the output grid's row, from the largest block's start_column to end_column (inclusive), to the primary_color. This action is skipped if no largest block was found.
relationship:
  - type: filtering_and_preservation
    based_on: horizontal_block length
    description: The transformation filters the input row's primary_color_pixels, preserving only those that constitute the single longest contiguous horizontal_block. These preserved pixels are placed in the corresponding row/columns of the output grid. All other pixels (background and non-largest blocks/pixels) are mapped to the background_color in the output.
