Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output appear to be 1-dimensional arrays or single rows of pixels. The length is consistent (29 pixels) across all examples.
2.  **Colors:** Each example uses two colors: white (0) and one other color (yellow=4 or gray=5).
3.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain instances of the non-white color. These instances appear in two forms:
    *   Isolated single pixels (e.g., `0 4 0` in train_1).
    *   A contiguous horizontal block of the non-white color (e.g., `4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4` in train_1).
4.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains only the largest contiguous horizontal block of the non-white color found in the input. All other pixels, including the previously isolated non-white pixels, are turned white (0).
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying contiguous blocks of the non-white color, selecting the largest one, and discarding (setting to white) all other non-white pixels. The background white pixels remain white.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Keep only the largest contiguous horizontal block of the non-white color.
elements:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    role: static background
  - object: primary_color_pixels
    color: non-white (e.g., yellow=4, gray=5)
    role: potentially part of the output pattern
properties:
  - property: contiguity
    applies_to: primary_color_pixels
    description: Pixels of the primary color are grouped based on horizontal adjacency.
  - property: block_size
    applies_to: contiguous blocks of primary_color_pixels
    description: The number of pixels in a contiguous horizontal block.
actions:
  - action: identify_primary_color
    description: Determine the single non-white color present in the input.
  - action: find_contiguous_blocks
    input: input grid, primary_color
    output: list of contiguous horizontal blocks of the primary color, including their start/end indices and sizes.
  - action: find_largest_block
    input: list of contiguous blocks
    output: the block with the maximum size. (Assumption: If multiple blocks have the same max size, the specific examples don't clarify selection, but likely the first or last encountered based on typical iteration). Based on examples, there's only one largest block.
  - action: create_output_grid
    based_on: input grid dimensions
    initial_value: all white (0) pixels
  - action: transfer_largest_block
    input: largest block coordinates, primary color
    target: output grid
    description: Fill the corresponding pixels in the output grid with the primary color, replicating the largest block found in the input.
relationship:
  - type: selection_criteria
    based_on: block_size (contiguity)
    description: Only the pixels belonging to the single largest contiguous horizontal block of the primary color are preserved in the output; all others become background.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, but filled entirely with the background color (white/0).
2.  Identify the primary non-white color present in the input grid.
3.  Scan the input grid horizontally to find all contiguous blocks (sequences of 1 or more adjacent pixels) of the primary non-white color. Record the start index, end index, and size (length) of each block.
4.  Determine the maximum size among all identified blocks.
5.  Identify the block(s) that have this maximum size. (Based on the examples, assume there is only one such largest block).
6.  If a largest block exists (i.e., if there were any non-white pixels in the input), iterate from the start index to the end index of this largest block. For each position within this range, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the primary non-white color.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
