The length is consistent (29 pixels) across all examples.\n2.  **Colors:** Each example uses two colors: white (0) and one other color (yellow=4 or gray=5).\n3.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain instances of the non-white color. These instances appear in two forms:\n    *   Isolated single pixels (e.g., `0 4 0` in train_1).\n    *   A contiguous horizontal block of the non-white color (e.g., `4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4` in train_1).\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains only the largest contiguous horizontal block of the non-white color found in the input. All other pixels, including the previously isolated non-white pixels, are turned white (0).\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying contiguous blocks of the non-white color, selecting the largest one, and discarding (setting to white) all other non-white pixels. The background white pixels remain white.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
