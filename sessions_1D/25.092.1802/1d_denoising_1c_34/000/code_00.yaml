task_description: Keep only the largest contiguous horizontal block of the non-white color.
elements:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    role: static background
  - object: primary_color_pixels
    color: non-white (e.g., yellow=4, gray=5)
    role: potentially part of the output pattern
properties:
  - property: contiguity
    applies_to: primary_color_pixels
    description: Pixels of the primary color are grouped based on horizontal adjacency.
  - property: block_size
    applies_to: contiguous blocks of primary_color_pixels
    description: The number of pixels in a contiguous horizontal block.
actions:
  - action: identify_primary_color
    description: Determine the single non-white color present in the input.
  - action: find_contiguous_blocks
    input: input grid, primary_color
    output: list of contiguous horizontal blocks of the primary color, including their start/end indices and sizes.
  - action: find_largest_block
    input: list of contiguous blocks
    output: the block with the maximum size. (Assumption: If multiple blocks have the same max size, the specific examples don't clarify selection, but likely the first or last encountered based on typical iteration). Based on examples, there's only one largest block.
  - action: create_output_grid
    based_on: input grid dimensions
    initial_value: all white (0) pixels
  - action: transfer_largest_block
    input: largest block coordinates, primary color
    target: output grid
    description: Fill the corresponding pixels in the output grid with the primary color, replicating the largest block found in the input.
relationship:
  - type: selection_criteria
    based_on: block_size (contiguity)
    description: Only the pixels belonging to the single largest contiguous horizontal block of the primary color are preserved in the output; all others become background.
