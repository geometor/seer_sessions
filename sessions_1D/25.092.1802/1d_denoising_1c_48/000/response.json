            "text": "*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid. Both input and output grids seem to have the same dimensions (likely 4x8 based on the 32 elements provided). The input grids contain a background color (white, 0) and one other foreground color (blue, magenta, or azure). The transformation appears to isolate a single row from the input grid and place it in the corresponding position in the output grid, while all other rows in the output grid are filled with the background color (white). The key is to determine which row from the input is selected. By analyzing the examples, it appears the row selected is the one containing the highest count of the foreground color. If multiple rows share the highest count, the topmost (first) of these rows is selected.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
