*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid. Both input and output grids seem to have the same dimensions (likely 4x8 based on the 32 elements provided). The input grids contain a background color (white, 0) and one other foreground color (blue, magenta, or azure). The transformation appears to isolate a single row from the input grid and place it in the corresponding position in the output grid, while all other rows in the output grid are filled with the background color (white). The key is to determine which row from the input is selected. By analyzing the examples, it appears the row selected is the one containing the highest count of the foreground color. If multiple rows share the highest count, the topmost (first) of these rows is selected.

      criterion_details:
        - identify_foreground_color: Determine the non-white color present.
        - count_pixels: Count the occurrences of the foreground color in each row.
        - find_max_count: Determine the maximum count among all rows.
        - select_row: Choose the first row (from top to bottom) that achieves the maximum count.
      output_construction:
        - copy_selected_row: Place the selected row into the corresponding row of the output grid.
        - fill_background: Set all other rows in the output grid to the background color (0).
    uncertainties:
      - behavior_with_multiple_foreground_colors: Not observed in examples. Assuming only one foreground color exists per input.
      - grid_dimensions: Assumed based on data length (32 -> 4x8). Need confirmation if other dimensions are possible.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the dimensions (height `H` and width `W`) of the input grid.
    2.  Identify the primary foreground color (any color other than white/0) present in the input grid. Assume there is only one such color.
    3.  Initialize variables: `max_count` to -1, `selected_row_index` to -1.
    4.  Iterate through each row of the input grid from top to bottom (index `r` from 0 to `H-1`).
        a.  Count the number of pixels in the current row (`r`) that match the identified foreground color. Let this be `current_count`.
        b.  If `current_count` is greater than `max_count`:
            i.  Update `max_count` to `current_count`.
            ii. Update `selected_row_index` to `r`.
    5.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions (`H` x `W`), initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
    6.  If a `selected_row_index` was found (i.e., `selected_row_index` is not -1, meaning there was at least one foreground pixel):
        a.  Copy the row from the input grid at index `selected_row_index` to the output grid at the same index `selected_row_index`.
    7.  Return the generated output grid.
