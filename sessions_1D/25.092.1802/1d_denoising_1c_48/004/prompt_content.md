"""
Identify the primary foreground color (non-white/0) in the input grid.
Iterate through each row of the input grid and count the occurrences of this foreground color.
Determine the row index that contains the maximum count of the foreground color. 
If multiple rows share the maximum count, select the topmost row (the one with the smallest row index).
Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white/0).
Copy the selected row (the topmost row with the maximum foreground pixel count) from the input grid into the corresponding row of the output grid.
Return the modified output grid.

def find_foreground_color(grid):

    Finds the first non-zero (non-background) color encountered in the grid.
    Assumes there is at most one non-background color per grid based on examples.
