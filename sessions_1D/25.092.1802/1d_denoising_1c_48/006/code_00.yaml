task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  assumed_dimensions: [4, 8] # Based on visual inspection and data length (32)
  background_color: 0 # white
input_characteristics:
  - contains_background: true
  - contains_single_foreground_color: true # Observed in examples: 1 (blue), 6 (magenta), 8 (azure)
  - foreground_objects: Contains one or more connected components (objects) of the foreground color. Cardinal adjacency defines connectivity.
output_characteristics:
  - contains_background: true
  - contains_single_selected_object: The output contains only the pixels of specific object(s) selected from the input.
  - preserves_object_shape_and_position: The selected object(s) appear in the same location in the output as in the input.
transformation_logic:
  selection_criterion: object_based
  criterion_details:
    - step_1_find_foreground: Identify the unique non-background color (C).
    - step_2_find_max_row: Determine the index (`max_row_idx`) of the row with the maximum count of C. Ties broken by choosing the topmost row (smallest index).
    - step_3_find_objects: Identify all connected components (objects) of color C using 4-way adjacency.
    - step_4_select_target_objects: Filter the objects found in step 3. Keep only those objects that have at least one pixel located on the `max_row_idx`.
  output_construction:
    - step_1_create_background_grid: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (0).
    - step_2_copy_target_pixels: For every pixel belonging to the selected target object(s) (from step 4), copy its color (C) and position from the input grid to the output grid.
uncertainties:
  - grid_dimensions: Not explicitly given, inferred as 4x8. Other dimensions might require different parsing.
  - tie-breaking_multiple_objects: What happens if multiple distinct objects intersect the `max_row_idx`? (Assumption: Keep all such objects).
  - tie-breaking_max_rows: Confirmed assumption: Use topmost row in case of tie for max count.
  - no_foreground_pixels: Assumed behavior if input is all background: output is all background.
