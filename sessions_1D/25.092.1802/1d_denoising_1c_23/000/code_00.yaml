input_features:
  - object_type: connected_component
    color: non_zero # The primary color varies (3, 1, 5)

    description: Consists of one large rectangular component and several smaller, disconnected components (single pixels or small groups) of the same non-zero color.
    properties:
      - size: varying (one large, others small)
      - connectivity: 4-neighbor (assumed)
output_features:
  - object_type: connected_component
    color: non_zero # Same as the primary input color
    count: one
    description: Only the largest connected component from the input remains.
    properties:
      - size: largest among input components of that color
      - position: same as in input
      - color: same as in input
transformation:
  - action: identify_components
    target_color: non_zero
    connectivity: 4-neighbor # pixels sharing an edge are connected
  - action: find_largest_component
    criteria: pixel_count
  - action: filter_components
    rule: keep only the largest component identified
  - action: generate_output
    rule: create a new grid containing only the pixels of the largest component, setting all other pixels to the background color (0).
