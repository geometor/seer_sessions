Additionally, there are smaller, scattered pixels or small groups of pixels of the *same* color elsewhere in the grid. The background is always white (0).\n\nThe transformation involves identifying the largest connected group of pixels of the non-background color. This largest group (the rectangle) is preserved in the output grid. All other pixels of that same color, which are not part of the largest connected group, are changed to the background color (white). The original background pixels remain white.\n\nEssentially, the task isolates the main, largest object of a given color and removes any smaller, disconnected \"noise\" pixels of the same color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
