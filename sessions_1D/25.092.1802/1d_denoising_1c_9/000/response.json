There might also be isolated single pixels of the same dominant color.\n4.  **Output Features:** The output row contains only *one* contiguous horizontal block of the dominant color, located at the same position as the *longest* corresponding block in the input. All other pixels, including the previously isolated ones or shorter blocks, are turned white.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation identifies all contiguous horizontal segments of the non-white color in the input row, selects the longest segment among them, and reproduces only this longest segment in the output row, filling the rest with the white background color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
