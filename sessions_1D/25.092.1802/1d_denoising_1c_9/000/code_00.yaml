task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 2D
  grid_size: variable width, height of 1 (single row)
  background_color: white (0)
  relevant_colors: one dominant non-white color per example (e.g., green, blue, red)

input_features:
  objects:
    - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
      description: A sequence of one or more adjacent pixels of the same non-white color in the row.
      properties:
        - color: the non-white color of the pixels in the segment
        - length: the number of pixels in the segment
        - position: the starting and ending column index of the segment
  relationships:
    - Multiple segments of the same color can exist.
    - Segments can have different lengths.

output_features:
  objects:
    - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
      description: A single segment corresponding to the largest segment from the input.
      properties:
        - color: same as the largest input segment
        - length: same as the largest input segment
        - position: same as the largest input segment
  relationships:
    - Only one non-white object exists in the output.
    - All other pixels are the background color (white).

transformation:
  action: selection_and_filtering
  criteria: identify the single longest contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels.
  process:
    - Find all contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels in the input row.
    - Determine the segment with the maximum length. If there's a tie, any of the longest segments can be chosen (though ties don't occur in the examples).
    - Create a new output row of the same dimensions as the input, initially filled with the background color (white).
    - Copy the pixels corresponding to the longest segment found in the input into the same positions in the output row.
