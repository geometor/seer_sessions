Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output grids are single rows of pixels (1xN dimensions).
2.  **Content:** The grids contain a background color (white, 0) and one other dominant color (green=3, blue=1, or red=2 depending on the example).
3.  **Input Features:** The input row features one or more contiguous horizontal blocks (segments) of the dominant color. There might also be isolated single pixels of the same dominant color.
4.  **Output Features:** The output row contains only *one* contiguous horizontal block of the dominant color, located at the same position as the *longest* corresponding block in the input. All other pixels, including the previously isolated ones or shorter blocks, are turned white.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation identifies all contiguous horizontal segments of the non-white color in the input row, selects the longest segment among them, and reproduces only this longest segment in the output row, filling the rest with the white background color.

## Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 2D
  grid_size: variable width, height of 1 (single row)
  background_color: white (0)
  relevant_colors: one dominant non-white color per example (e.g., green, blue, red)

input_features:
  objects:
    - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
      description: A sequence of one or more adjacent pixels of the same non-white color in the row.
      properties:
        - color: the non-white color of the pixels in the segment
        - length: the number of pixels in the segment
        - position: the starting and ending column index of the segment
  relationships:
    - Multiple segments of the same color can exist.
    - Segments can have different lengths.

output_features:
  objects:
    - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
      description: A single segment corresponding to the largest segment from the input.
      properties:
        - color: same as the largest input segment
        - length: same as the largest input segment
        - position: same as the largest input segment
  relationships:
    - Only one non-white object exists in the output.
    - All other pixels are the background color (white).

transformation:
  action: selection_and_filtering
  criteria: identify the single longest contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels.
  process:
    - Find all contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels in the input row.
    - Determine the segment with the maximum length. If there's a tie, any of the longest segments can be chosen (though ties don't occur in the examples).
    - Create a new output row of the same dimensions as the input, initially filled with the background color (white).
    - Copy the pixels corresponding to the longest segment found in the input into the same positions in the output row.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input row to identify all contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of non-white pixels. For each segment found, record its color, starting position (column index), and length.
3.  Compare the lengths of all identified segments.
4.  Select the segment that has the greatest length.
5.  Copy the pixels (color and position) of this longest segment from the input grid directly onto the corresponding positions in the output grid.
6.  The final output grid now contains only the single longest segment from the input, with all other positions filled with the background color.
