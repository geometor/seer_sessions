It preserves this largest segment while replacing all other cells, including isolated instances or smaller segments of the same non-white color, with the background color (white).\n4.  **Object Identification:** The primary object of interest is the longest continuous sequence of a single non-white color.\n5.  **Action:** The action is selective removal or replacement. Pixels belonging to the largest segment are kept; all others become white.\n\n### Facts\n\n"

Scan the input row to find all contiguous segments (sequences of one or more adjacent pixels) of this identified non-white color.\n3.  Determine the length of each identified segment.\n4.  Identify the segment with the greatest length. If there are multiple segments of the same maximum length, the examples don't specify which to keep, but they only show cases with one unique longest segment. Assume there's a single longest segment.\n5.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n6.  Copy the pixels corresponding to the single longest segment identified in step 4 from the input row to the same positions in the new output row.\n7.  The resulting new row is the final output."
