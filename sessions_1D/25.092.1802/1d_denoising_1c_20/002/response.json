            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core task: finding the largest contiguous block of a non-white color in a 1D sequence and setting all other pixels to white. The provided Python code implements this logic. However, the execution resulted in errors (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\") for all training examples.\n\nThis specific error typically occurs in Python when a NumPy array is used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., `if array:`). Given that the ARC framework often represents grids, even 1D ones, as nested lists or 2D NumPy arrays (e.g., a 1xN grid), the most likely cause is that the `transform` function received a 2D structure (like `[[0, 0, 7, ...]]`) instead of the expected flat list (`[0, 0, 7, ...]`). The iteration or comparison logic within the function likely encountered the inner list/array, leading to the ambiguity error.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Input Structure:** Use `tool_code` to confirm the dimensionality and structure of the input grids provided to the function. We expect them to be represented as 1xN structures.\n2.  **Adapt Code:** Modify the `transform` function to explicitly handle a 1xN input by extracting the single row (the 1D sequence) before processing.\n3.  **Re-evaluate Logic:** Ensure the rest of the logic (finding blocks, comparing lengths, copying the largest block) correctly operates on the extracted 1D sequence.\n4.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the input structure (1xN grid) and the necessary step of extracting the 1D sequence.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's verify the input structure and dimensions.\n"
