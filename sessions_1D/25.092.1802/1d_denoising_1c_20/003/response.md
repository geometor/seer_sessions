"""
Given a 1xN input grid containing white pixels (0) and pixels of a single non-white color C,
identify the single largest contiguous block (horizontal sequence) of color C.
Create an output grid of the same 1xN dimensions, initially filled with white (0).
Copy only the pixels belonging to the largest identified block from the input to the output grid
at the same positions. If multiple blocks share the maximum length, the first one encountered
while scanning from left to right is chosen. All other pixels in the output remain white.
