**Perception:**

The task operates on a one-dimensional array of pixels (colors). Each input array contains white pixels (represented by 0) and pixels of one other color (e.g., orange=7, gray=5, azure=8). The goal is to isolate the single largest contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input array. All other pixels, including any smaller blocks or individual pixels of the non-white color, should be turned white (0) in the output. The output array has the same dimensions as the input array.

**YAML Facts:**

  steps:
    - Identify all contiguous blocks of the non-white color C in the input array.
    - Determine the length of each identified block.
    - Find the block with the maximum length. (Assume the first one found if there are ties in length, though examples don't test this).
    - Create an output array of the same size as the input, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
    - Copy the pixels corresponding to the largest identified block from the input array to the same positions in the output array.
relationships:
  - Adjacency: Defines contiguous blocks.
  - Size comparison: Used to select the largest block.
  - Positional correspondence: The largest block retains its original position in the output.
invariants:
  - Grid dimensions remain the same.
  - The color of the pixels within the largest block remains the same.
  - The position of the largest block remains the same.
  - White pixels outside the span of the largest block remain white.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output array with the same dimensions as the input array, filling it entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Identify the single non-white color present in the input array.
3.  Scan the input array to find all contiguous blocks (sequences of one or more adjacent pixels) of this non-white color. Record the start index, end index, and length of each block.
4.  Compare the lengths of all identified blocks and select the block with the greatest length. If multiple blocks share the maximum length, select the one that appears first in the input array.
5.  If a largest block is found (i.e., if the input contains at least one non-white pixel), copy the pixels from this largest block (using its start and end indices) from the input array to the corresponding positions in the output array.
6.  Return the modified output array.

**Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core task: finding the largest contiguous block of a non-white color in a 1D sequence and setting all other pixels to white. The provided Python code implements this logic. However, the execution resulted in errors ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous") for all training examples.

This specific error typically occurs in Python when a NumPy array is used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., `if array:`). Given that the ARC framework often represents grids, even 1D ones, as nested lists or 2D NumPy arrays (e.g., a 1xN grid), the most likely cause is that the `transform` function received a 2D structure (like `[[0, 0, 7, ...]]`) instead of the expected flat list (`[0, 0, 7, ...]`). The iteration or comparison logic within the function likely encountered the inner list/array, leading to the ambiguity error.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Input Structure:** Use `tool_code` to confirm the dimensionality and structure of the input grids provided to the function. We expect them to be represented as 1xN structures.
2.  **Adapt Code:** Modify the `transform` function to explicitly handle a 1xN input by extracting the single row (the 1D sequence) before processing.
3.  **Re-evaluate Logic:** Ensure the rest of the logic (finding blocks, comparing lengths, copying the largest block) correctly operates on the extracted 1D sequence.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the input structure (1xN grid) and the necessary step of extracting the 1D sequence.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's verify the input structure and dimensions.

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  Given a 1xN input grid containing white pixels (0) and pixels of a single non-white color C.
2.  Create a new 1xN output grid of the same dimensions, initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).
3.  Extract the sequence of pixels from the single row of the input grid.
4.  Identify the non-white color C used in the input sequence. If no non-white color exists, return the all-white output grid.
5.  Scan the input sequence to locate all contiguous blocks (adjacent sequences) of pixels with color C. For each block, record its starting column index, ending column index (exclusive), and its length.
6.  Find the maximum length among all the recorded blocks.
