Each input array contains white pixels (represented by 0) and pixels of one other color (e.g., orange=7, gray=5, azure=8). The goal is to isolate the single largest contiguous block of non-white pixels within the input array. All other pixels, including any smaller blocks or individual pixels of the non-white color, should be turned white (0) in the output. The output array has the same dimensions as the input array.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
