task_type: object_manipulation
input_domain:
  dimensionality: 1
  pixel_colors:
    - white (0)
    - one other color C (non-zero)
  elements:
    - pixels:
        attributes: [color, position]
    - contiguous_blocks:
        description: Sequences of adjacent pixels of the same non-white color C.
        attributes: [color, start_position, end_position, length]
output_domain:
  dimensionality: 1
  pixel_colors:
    - white (0)
    - the same color C from the input
  elements:
    - pixels:
        attributes: [color, position]
    - single_block:
        description: The largest contiguous block of color C identified from the input.
        attributes: [color, start_position, end_position, length]
transformation:
  operation: filtering / selection
  steps:
    - Identify all contiguous blocks of the non-white color C in the input array.
    - Determine the length of each identified block.
    - Find the block with the maximum length. (Assume the first one found if there are ties in length, though examples don't test this).
    - Create an output array of the same size as the input, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
    - Copy the pixels corresponding to the largest identified block from the input array to the same positions in the output array.
relationships:
  - Adjacency: Defines contiguous blocks.
  - Size comparison: Used to select the largest block.
  - Positional correspondence: The largest block retains its original position in the output.
invariants:
  - Grid dimensions remain the same.
  - The color of the pixels within the largest block remains the same.
  - The position of the largest block remains the same.
  - White pixels outside the span of the largest block remain white.
