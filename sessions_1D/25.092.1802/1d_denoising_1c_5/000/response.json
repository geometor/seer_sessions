            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\nThe input grids contain scattered pixels of a single foreground color (yellow in `train_1`, red in `train_2`, yellow in `train_3`) on a white background. The output grids retain only one specific horizontal line segment from the input grid, turning all other pixels white. The core task appears to be identifying and isolating the \"most important\" horizontal line segment according to some criteria.\n\nObserving the examples:\n1.  In `train_1`, the input has various yellow pixels, but the longest contiguous horizontal segment is the full row of yellow at the bottom (row index 4). The output keeps only this line.\n2.  In `train_2`, the input has two full horizontal lines of red pixels (row indices 3 and 4) and a few other scattered red pixels. Both lines have the same maximum length (5). The output keeps only the bottom-most of these two lines (row index 4).\n3.  In `train_3`, the input has yellow pixels forming various shapes, including horizontal segments of length 3 (row index 1), length 5 (row index 2), and length 3 (row index 3). The longest segment is the one in row index 2. The output keeps only this line.\n\nFrom these observations, the rule seems to involve finding the longest horizontal contiguous segment of non-white pixels. If there's a tie for the longest segment, the one in the lowest row (highest row index) is chosen. The final output grid consists of only this selected segment against a white background.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
