task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same dimensions (5x5 in examples).
    - background_color: Consistently white (0).
    - foreground_colors: A single non-white color per example (yellow/4, red/2).
  elements:
    - type: Pixel
      properties:
        - color
        - position (row, column)
    - type: Horizontal Segment
      definition: A contiguous sequence of one or more pixels of the same non-white color within the same row.
      properties:
        - color
        - length (number of pixels)
        - row_index
        - start_column
        - end_column
  transformation: Filtering based on segment properties.

selection_criteria:
  primary:
    - property: length
    - rule: Select the Horizontal Segment(s) with the maximum length.
  secondary (tie-breaker):
    - condition: More than one segment has the maximum length.
    - property: row_index
    - rule: Select the segment with the highest row index (i.e., the lowest one visually).

output_generation:
  - Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the background color (white).
  - Place the selected Horizontal Segment into the output grid at its original position.
  - All other pixels remain the background color.
