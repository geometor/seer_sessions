To understand the spatial relationships, these sequences must be reshaped into 2D grids.\n2.  **Grid Dimensions:** The dimensions are not explicit. By analyzing the lengths of the sequences and the structure suggested by the transformations, the dimensions can be inferred:\n    *   Examples 1 & 2: Input length 34, Output length 34. Likely dimensions are 2x17 (or 17x2). The transformation preserves dimensions.\n    *   Example 3: Input length 31, Output length 31. Likely dimensions are 31x1 (or 1x31). The transformation preserves dimensions.\n3.  **Colors:** The primary colors are white (0), which acts as the background, and one other non-background color per example (orange/7 in Ex 1 & 2, magenta/6 in Ex 3).\n4.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying structures within the non-background pixels. Specifically, it focuses on contiguous blocks of the non-background color. Connectivity is defined by horizontal and vertical adjacency. The key operation is to isolate the *largest* such contiguous block (by pixel count) and remove all other non-background pixels, changing them to the background color (white/0).\n5.  **Objects:** The main objects of interest are these contiguous blocks of non-background pixels. Their key property is their size (number of pixels).\n6.  **Consistency:** The rule \"identify the largest contiguous block of non-background color and keep only that block in the output grid (of the same dimensions), setting all other pixels to background\" consistently explains all three examples after correctly inferring the grid shapes and output sizes.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
