task_description: Isolate the largest contiguous block of non-background pixels.

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  background_color: 0 (white)
  shape_inference: Required based on sequence length and factors. Dimensions are preserved from input to output.

objects:
  - name: background_pixels
    color: 0 (white)
    role: Fills the grid initially and replaces removed pixels.
  - name: foreground_pixels
    color: Any color other than 0 (e.g., 7/orange, 6/magenta).
    role: Form structures within the grid.
  - name: contiguous_block
    definition: A group of connected foreground_pixels of the same color, where connectivity is defined by horizontal and vertical adjacency.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block.
      - size: The number of pixels in the block.
      - location: The set of coordinates occupied by the block's pixels.

actions:
  - name: identify_blocks
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_contiguous_blocks
    description: Find all distinct contiguous blocks of non-background pixels in the input grid.
  - name: calculate_block_sizes
    input: list_of_contiguous_blocks
    output: list_of_block_sizes
    description: Determine the number of pixels (size) for each identified block.
  - name: find_largest_block
    input: list_of_contiguous_blocks, list_of_block_sizes
    output: largest_block
    description: Identify the contiguous block with the maximum size. Assumes a unique largest block based on examples.
  - name: generate_output_grid
    input: input_grid_dimensions, largest_block
    output: output_grid
    description: Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (0). Then, copy the pixels belonging to the largest_block from their original input positions to the corresponding positions in the new grid.

relationships:
  - The output grid's dimensions are identical to the input grid's dimensions.
  - The output grid contains only the background color (0) and the pixels corresponding to the single largest contiguous block of non-background color found in the input grid. All other pixels from the input grid (including smaller non-background blocks) are represented as the background color in the output.
