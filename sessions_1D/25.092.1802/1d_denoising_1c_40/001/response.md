"""
Identify all contiguous blocks of non-background pixels (color != 0) in the input grid, where connectivity is defined by horizontal and vertical adjacency. Calculate the size (number of pixels) of each block. Find the block with the largest size. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the background color (0). Copy the pixels belonging to the largest identified block from the input grid to their corresponding positions in the output grid.
