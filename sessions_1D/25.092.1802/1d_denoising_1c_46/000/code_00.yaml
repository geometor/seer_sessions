grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Fixed between input and output (appears to be 7x5 for these examples).
  - background_color: white (0)
  - dominant_color: Varies per example (azure '8', yellow '4', green '3'), only one non-white color per grid.

objects:
  - type: Connected component of the dominant color.
  - properties:
      - color: The dominant color of the grid.
      - pixels: A set of coordinates forming the component.
      - size: The number of pixels in the component.
  - relationship: Multiple distinct components can exist in the input.

actions:
  - Identify all connected components of the dominant color in the input grid.
  - Calculate the size of each component.
  - Select the component with the maximum size.
  - Create a new grid filled with the background color.
  - Place the selected largest component onto the new grid at its original coordinates.

derived_object:
  - type: The largest connected component of the dominant color.
  - source: Input grid.
  - destination: Output grid.
