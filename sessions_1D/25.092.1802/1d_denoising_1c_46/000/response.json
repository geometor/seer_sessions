Based on the number of elements (35), the most likely dimensions are 7x5 or 5x7. Examining the patterns suggests a 7x5 grid structure across all examples.\n2.  **Colors:** Each example uses two colors: white (0) as the background and one other dominant color (azure '8', yellow '4', or green '3').\n3.  **Input Structure:** The input grid contains multiple disconnected groups (objects) of the dominant color scattered across the white background. One of these groups is significantly larger than the others.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains only the single largest connected group of the dominant color from the input. All other pixels, including the smaller groups of the dominant color and the original background pixels, are set to the background color (white).\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying all distinct connected components of the non-background color, determining which component is the largest (contains the most pixels), and then creating an output grid that solely consists of this largest component placed on a white background. Connectivity should be considered for adjacent cells, including diagonals (8-connectivity).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
