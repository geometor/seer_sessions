In these examples, the objects consist of either single, isolated pixels or a single contiguous horizontal block of pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be an object filtering process. Specifically, isolated non-white pixels are removed (changed to the background color, white/0), while the large contiguous block of the non-white color is preserved.\n5.  **Key Feature:** The distinguishing feature seems to be connectivity or size. The largest contiguous block of the non-white color is retained, and all smaller blocks (in these cases, single pixels) are eliminated.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
