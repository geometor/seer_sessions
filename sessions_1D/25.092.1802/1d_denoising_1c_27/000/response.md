**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional arrays (or 1xN grids).
2.  **Colors:** Each example uses white (0) as the background color and one distinct non-white color for objects (gray, green, or magenta).
3.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form distinct objects. In these examples, the objects consist of either single, isolated pixels or a single contiguous horizontal block of pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be an object filtering process. Specifically, isolated non-white pixels are removed (changed to the background color, white/0), while the large contiguous block of the non-white color is preserved.
5.  **Key Feature:** The distinguishing feature seems to be connectivity or size. The largest contiguous block of the non-white color is retained, and all smaller blocks (in these cases, single pixels) are eliminated.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Filter objects based on size/connectivity, keeping only the largest contiguous block.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN)
background_color: white (0)
object_colors: [gray (5), green (3), magenta (6)] # Varies per example, but only one non-background color per example.
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    property: largest_size # The block with the maximum number of connected pixels of the same color.
    action: keep
  - type: isolated_pixel
    property: size_1 # Single non-connected pixels.
    action: remove # Change to background color.
  - type: smaller_contiguous_block # Hypothesis, not explicitly shown but implied by "largest".
    action: remove # Change to background color.
relationships:
  - type: size_comparison
    description: The transformation identifies the largest contiguous block of the primary non-white color.
  - type: filtering
    description: All non-white pixels not part of the largest contiguous block are replaced with the background color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the background color (which is white/0 in all examples).
2.  Identify all pixels that are not the background color. Note their color (there will only be one such color per grid).
3.  Find all contiguous blocks (objects) formed by these non-background pixels. A block can consist of one or more adjacent pixels of the same color.
4.  Calculate the size (number of pixels) of each contiguous block.
5.  Determine the block with the largest size.
6.  Create the output grid, initially matching the input grid.
7.  Iterate through all the identified non-background blocks.
8.  For every block that is *not* the largest block, change the color of all pixels within that block to the background color (white/0) in the output grid.
9.  The largest block remains unchanged in the output grid. Background pixels also remain unchanged.
