task_description: Filter objects based on size/connectivity, keeping only the largest contiguous block.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 1xN)
background_color: white (0)
object_colors: [gray (5), green (3), magenta (6)] # Varies per example, but only one non-background color per example.
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    property: largest_size # The block with the maximum number of connected pixels of the same color.
    action: keep
  - type: isolated_pixel
    property: size_1 # Single non-connected pixels.
    action: remove # Change to background color.
  - type: smaller_contiguous_block # Hypothesis, not explicitly shown but implied by "largest".
    action: remove # Change to background color.
relationships:
  - type: size_comparison
    description: The transformation identifies the largest contiguous block of the primary non-white color.
  - type: filtering
    description: All non-white pixels not part of the largest contiguous block are replaced with the background color.
