task_description: Filter objects in a 1D grid, keeping only the largest contiguous block(s) of the non-background color.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a 1xN list of lists)
background_color: white (0)
object_colors: Variable (one non-white color per grid, e.g., gray, green, magenta)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    color: the single non-background color present in the input grid
    property: size (number of pixels in the block)
    identification: find all such blocks in the input row
actions:
  - determine_max_size: find the maximum size among all identified blocks.
  - filter:
      target: contiguous blocks
      condition: block size < max_size
      effect: change all pixels within the target block to the background color (white/0).
  - preserve:
      target: contiguous blocks
      condition: block size == max_size
      effect: keep these blocks unchanged in the output grid.
output_grid_construction: Start with a background-colored grid of the same dimensions as the input, then draw only the preserved largest block(s).
