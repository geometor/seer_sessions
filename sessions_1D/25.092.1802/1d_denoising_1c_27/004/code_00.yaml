task_description: Filter objects in a 1D grid, keeping only the largest contiguous block of the single non-background color.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a flat list or list containing one list)
background_color: white (0)
object_colors: Varies per example (gray, green, magenta), but only one non-background color per grid.
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    description: A sequence of one or more adjacent pixels of the same non-background color.
    properties:
      - color: The non-background color (e.g., 5, 3, or 6).
      - size: The number of pixels in the block.
      - location: Start and end indices within the 1D grid.
    actions:
      - identify: Find all such blocks in the input grid.
      - compare_size: Determine the maximum size among all identified blocks.
      - keep_largest: Retain blocks whose size equals the maximum size.
      - remove_smaller: Change pixels of blocks smaller than the maximum size to the background color.
relationships:
  - type: size_comparison
    description: Blocks are compared based on their size (length).
  - type: filtering
    description: Only the block(s) with the maximum size are preserved in the output; others are removed (set to background color).
input_format: Can be a flat list of integers or a list containing a single list of integers. String representation in problem description needs parsing.
output_format: Matches the input format (flat list or list of list).
