task_description: Filter objects in a 1xN grid by size. Identify all contiguous horizontal blocks of the single non-background color present. Retain only the block(s) having the maximum size, replacing all other non-background pixels with the background color (0).
grid_dimensionality: 2D, specifically 1xN.
background_color: white (0)
object_colors: A single non-background color per grid (variable across examples: gray, green, magenta observed).
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_block
    description: A sequence of 1 or more adjacent pixels in the row having the same non-background color.
    properties: [color, size (length), location (start/end indices)]
  - type: background
    description: Pixels with the background color (0).
identification_process:
  - Step 1: Determine the unique non-background color C (if any).
  - Step 2: Find all contiguous blocks of color C.
  - Step 3: Calculate the size of each block.
  - Step 4: Find the maximum size (max_size) among these blocks.
actions_on_objects:
  - target: contiguous_horizontal_block
    condition: size == max_size
    action: keep (preserve in output)
  - target: contiguous_horizontal_block
    condition: size < max_size
    action: remove (replace pixels with background_color in output)
  - target: background
    action: keep (preserve in output)
state_change: Input grid non-background pixels belonging to blocks smaller than the largest block are changed to the background color. Pixels of the largest block(s) and original background pixels remain unchanged.
output_grid_definition: A 1xN grid containing original background pixels and only the pixels from the largest contiguous non-background block(s) found in the input.
