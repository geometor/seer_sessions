            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core task: filtering objects in a 1D grid based on size, keeping only the largest contiguous block of the non-background color. The provided Python code attempted this but failed across all examples with a NumPy error related to ambiguous boolean evaluation of arrays. This suggests an issue with how array elements or the array itself were handled within conditional statements (`if`/`elif`).\n\nThe investigation points towards the input handling within the `transform` function, specifically how it interacts with the `find_contiguous_blocks` helper. If the input grid is passed or processed in a way that results in `find_contiguous_blocks` receiving a 2D array (even 1xN) instead of an explicitly 1D array, iterating over it would yield rows (arrays) instead of pixels (scalars). Comparing these row arrays to a scalar color (`pixel == target_color`) would produce a boolean array, triggering the error when used in the `if` statement.\n\nThe resolution involves modifying the `transform` function to robustly handle the input by converting it to a NumPy array and ensuring it is flattened to 1D before being passed to `find_contiguous_blocks`. This makes the implementation less sensitive to the exact input type provided by the execution environment.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nCode execution confirmed the following for the training examples:\n*   **Grid Size:** All inputs and outputs are 1x33 grids.\n*   **Colors:** White (0) is the background. Each example uses exactly one non-background color (gray-5, green-3, magenta-6).\n*   **Objects & Transformation:**\n    *   Example 1: Input has 1 gray pixel (size 1) and a gray block (size 13). Output retains the size 13 block.\n    *   Example 2: Input has 3 green pixels (size 1 each) and a green block (size 15). Output retains the size 15 block.\n    *   Example 3: Input has 3 magenta pixels (size 1 each) and a magenta block (size 14). Output retains the size 14 block.\n*   **Pattern:** In all cases, isolated pixels (blocks of size 1) are removed, and the single largest contiguous block is kept.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
