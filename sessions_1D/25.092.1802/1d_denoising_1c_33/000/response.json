Each input grid contains white pixels (0) and pixels of one other color (e.g., azure=8 or orange=7). The non-white pixels appear in one or more contiguous horizontal segments, and potentially as isolated single pixels. The output grid retains only the *longest* contiguous horizontal segment of the non-white color found in the input. All other pixels in the output grid, including shorter segments or isolated pixels of the non-white color, become white (0). The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
