task_type: filtering
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Effectively 1xN grids
color_usage:
  - background: white (0)
  - foreground: one other color per example (e.g., azure=8, orange=7)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    color: non-white color present in the input
    properties:
      - length
      - color_value
  - type: isolated_pixel
    color: non-white color present in the input
relationships:
  - multiple segments of the same non-white color can exist in the input
actions:
  - identify: the single non-white color present
  - find: all contiguous horizontal segments of this non-white color
  - measure: the length of each segment
  - select: the segment with the maximum length (if multiple have the same max length, the examples don't show this case, but implicitly any one of the longest would work, though typically the first encountered might be selected)
  - generate_output: create a new grid of the same size, filled with the background color (white)
  - copy: place the selected longest segment into the output grid at its original position
transformation: keep only the longest contiguous horizontal block of the non-background color, changing all other cells to the background color (white).
