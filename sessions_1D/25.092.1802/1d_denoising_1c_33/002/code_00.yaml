task_type: filtering
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row, potentially passed as 1D or 2D array/list)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    properties:
      - color (non-white)
      - length
      - start_index
      - end_index
relationships:
  - Input contains one or more segments of a single non-white color, potentially alongside isolated pixels of the same color.
actions:
  - identify_row: Extract the single row of data from the input (handling potential 1D/2D array/list formats).
  - identify_segments: Find all contiguous horizontal segments of any non-white color within the row.
  - calculate_lengths: Determine the length of each identified segment.
  - find_longest: Identify the segment with the maximum length. (Assumption: If ties, any longest segment is acceptable; the first encountered is a common implicit choice).
  - create_output_row: Generate a new row of the same length as the input row, filled with the background color (white).
  - copy_segment: Copy the pixels of the identified longest segment into the corresponding positions in the output row.
transformation: Filter the input row to retain only the single longest contiguous segment of the non-white color. All other pixels, including shorter segments or isolated pixels of the non-white color, are replaced with the background color (white). The output dimensions match the input row length (presented as a 1xN grid).
