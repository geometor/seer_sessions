            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are presented as 1D arrays of integers (0-9), representing colors. However, the transformations suggest an underlying 2D grid structure. The length of each array is 32. Possible grid dimensions are 4x8 or 8x4. Let's assume 4x8 for consistency in analysis, as it revealed clearer patterns.\n2.  **Colors:** Each example uses white (0) and one other primary color: gray (5) in train_1, blue (1) in train_2, and red (2) in train_3.\n3.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form shapes or objects within the grid. These objects can be contiguous blocks of the same color.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves removing some non-white pixels, changing them to white (0), while leaving others unchanged. Specifically, smaller, potentially disconnected, objects of a certain color seem to be removed, while the largest contiguous object of that color is preserved.\n\n**Analysis using 4x8 Grid Interpretation:**\n\n*   **Train 1 (Gray - 5):**\n    *   Input: Large gray object + two isolated gray pixels `(2,3)` and `(2,7)`.\n    *   Output: Only the large gray object remains; the isolated gray pixels are turned white.\n*   **Train 2 (Blue - 1):**\n    *   Input: Large blue object + several isolated blue pixels `(0,3), (0,7), (1,2), (1,5), (3,7)`.\n    *   Output: Only the large blue object remains; the isolated blue pixels are turned white.\n*   **Train 3 (Red - 2):**\n    *   Input: Large red object + one isolated red pixel `(0,4)`.\n    *   Output: Only the large red object remains; the isolated red pixel is turned white.\n\n**Key Observation:** For each non-white color present in the input grid, the transformation identifies the largest contiguous object (connected horizontally or vertically) of that color. All other pixels of that same color, which are not part of this largest object, are turned white (0).\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
