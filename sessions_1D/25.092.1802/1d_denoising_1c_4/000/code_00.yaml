task_description: Keep only the largest contiguous object for each color.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D (interpreted from 1D input)
  dimensions: likely 4x8 (based on 32 elements and pattern consistency)
  connectivity: 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right) used for defining contiguous objects.
objects:
  definition: A contiguous group of pixels of the same non-white color.
  properties:
    - color: The color shared by all pixels in the object.
    - size: The number of pixels in the object.
    - location: Coordinates of the pixels forming the object.
actions:
  - identify_objects: Find all distinct contiguous objects for each non-white color.
  - find_largest_object: For each color, determine which object has the maximum size.
  - filter_pixels: Identify pixels belonging to non-largest objects of each color.
  - modify_pixels: Change the color of identified non-largest object pixels to white (0).
relationships:
  - pixel_to_object: Each non-white pixel belongs to exactly one object of its color.
  - object_comparison: Objects of the same color are compared based on size.
transformation_rule:
  condition: Applies to each non-white color present in the grid independently.
  outcome: Preserve the single largest object of a given color and remove (set to white) all other pixels of that same color. If only one object of a color exists, it is preserved.
uncertainty:
  - Grid dimensions (4x8 assumed, could be 8x4).
  - Handling ties for the largest object (not observed in examples, assumed any one largest is kept).
  - Behavior with multiple non-white colors in a single input (assumed rule applies independently per color).
