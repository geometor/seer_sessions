            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core logic: preserving the largest contiguous object for each color. The error messages indicate the failure was due to an incorrect assumption about the input data format provided by the execution environment. The function expected a 1D list based on the textual representation in the prompt, but it likely received a 2D structure (numpy array or list of lists) causing the reshaping logic to fail.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Adapt Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to accept a 2D structure (assuming numpy array for compatibility with grid operations) directly. Remove the initial reshaping step.\n2.  **Dynamic Dimension Handling:** Determine the grid dimensions (`rows`, `cols`) from the `shape` attribute of the input numpy array.\n3.  **Maintain Core Logic:** The underlying algorithm of finding connected components (BFS/DFS), comparing their sizes, and modifying the grid remains the same.\n4.  **Adapt Output Handling:** Ensure the function returns the data in the same 2D format as the input (numpy array), removing the final flattening step.\n5.  **Validate Assumptions:** Use the provided examples and the corrected understanding of the input format to ensure the logic holds.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics gathered using `tool_code` confirm:\n\n*   **Input/Output Consistency:** All examples have input and output grids represented by 32 elements.\n*   **Dimensions:** The 32 elements can form 4x8 or 8x4 grids.\n*   **4x8 Interpretation:** Visually inspecting the examples reshaped to 4x8 strongly supports the \"keep largest object\" hypothesis. The outlier pixels removed in the outputs correspond to smaller, disconnected objects in the 4x8 input representation.\n*   **Object Identification:**\n    *   **Train 1 (Gray):** 1 large object, 2 small objects (1 pixel each). Output keeps the large one.\n    *   **Train 2 (Blue):** 1 large object, 5 small objects (1 pixel each). Output keeps the large one.\n    *   **Train 3 (Red):** 1 large object, 1 small object (1 pixel each). Output keeps the large one.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n\n"
