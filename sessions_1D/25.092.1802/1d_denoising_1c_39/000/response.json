Each input grid contains a background color (white, 0) and one other foreground color. The foreground color pixels are arranged in various horizontal segments, some contiguous and some isolated. The output grid retains only the single longest contiguous horizontal segment of the foreground color from the input, replacing all other pixels (including shorter foreground segments and isolated foreground pixels) with the background color. The dimensions of the output grid match the input grid.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
