task_elements:
  - item: grid
    description: Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with integer values representing colors.
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - dimensions: Consistent between input and output for each example (e.g., 6x6).
  - item: object
    description: A connected component of non-background pixels.
    properties:
      - color: A single non-white color per example (e.g., green, red).
      - connectivity: Orthogonal (pixels sharing an edge are connected).
      - size: The number of pixels composing the object.
  - item: relationship
    description: Comparison between objects based on size.
    properties:
      - criteria: Largest size (maximum number of pixels).
  - item: action
    description: Filtering the input grid based on object properties.
    steps:
      - Identify all connected components (objects) of non-white pixels.
      - Calculate the size of each component.
      - Select the component with the largest size.
      - Create a new grid initialized with the background color.
      - Place the pixels of the selected largest component onto the new grid at their original positions.
