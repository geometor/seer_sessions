In the provided examples, the grids appear to be 6x6.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) as the background, and one other non-white color per example (green (3) or red (2)).\n3.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form distinct shapes or \"objects\" within the grid. These objects are connected components of the same color. Connectivity appears to be orthogonal (sharing an edge), not diagonal.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation identifies all distinct connected components (objects) of the non-white color. It then determines which of these components is the largest (contains the most pixels). The output grid retains *only* the pixels belonging to this largest component, placed in their original positions. All other pixels in the output grid, including the background and pixels from smaller non-white components, are set to the background color (white/0).\n5.  **Goal:** The goal is to isolate the single largest connected object of a non-background color from the input grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

For each pixel belonging to the largest component identified in the previous step, copy its color and position from the input grid to the corresponding position in the output grid.\n8.  Return the final output grid."
