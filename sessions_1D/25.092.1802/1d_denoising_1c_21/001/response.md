"""
Identifies all connected components (objects) of non-white pixels in the input grid using orthogonal connectivity. 
Determines the component with the largest number of pixels.
Creates an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the background color (white/0).
Places only the pixels belonging to the largest component onto the output grid at their original positions and with their original color. 
If multiple components share the largest size, the behavior based on the provided examples is to select one (implicitly the first one found during the search, though the problem description doesn't explicitly handle ties - assuming a single largest based on examples). If no non-white components exist, returns the background grid.
