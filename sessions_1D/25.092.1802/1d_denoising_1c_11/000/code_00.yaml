task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  background_color: 0 (white) is consistently used as the background.
  foreground_color: A single non-zero color is present in each input grid (3, 7, or 4 in examples).
  connectivity: 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right) defines contiguous objects.

elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - width: variable
      - height: variable
      - pixels: color values (0-9)
  - element: object
    properties:
      - color: non-zero integer
      - pixels: list of coordinates (row, col)
      - size: count of pixels in the object
      - contiguous: defined by 4-way adjacency

transformation:
  action: identify_objects
  input: input grid
  parameters:
    - non_background_color: color != 0
    - connectivity: 4-way
  output: list of objects (pixels, color, size)

  action: select_largest_object
  input: list of objects
  parameters:
    - criteria: maximum size (pixel count)
  output: the single largest object

  action: construct_output_grid
  input:
    - original_input_grid_dimensions
    - largest_object
    - background_color (0)
  process: create a new grid of the same dimensions, fill with background_color, then paint the pixels of the largest_object with its color.
  output: output grid

relationships:
  - an object consists of contiguous pixels of the same non-background color.
  - the output grid contains only the pixels from the single largest input object.
  - all other pixels in the output grid adopt the background color.
