            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The inputs and outputs are grids of pixels represented by integers (colors). The grid sizes appear consistent within each example pair (6x5 in the provided examples).\n2.  **Colors**: Each example uses two colors: white (0) as a background and one other color (green/3, orange/7, or yellow/4) as a foreground or object color.\n3.  **Objects**: The foreground color forms distinct contiguous regions or \"objects\" within the grid. Connectivity seems to be based on adjacent sides (up, down, left, right), not diagonals.\n4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation seems to involve identifying these foreground objects and selecting only one of them based on a specific property. In the output, only the pixels belonging to the selected object retain their original color; all other pixels become the background color (white/0).\n5.  **Selection Criteria**: By comparing the input objects to the single object remaining in the output, the selection criterion appears to be size. The object with the largest area (number of pixels) is the one that is kept. All smaller objects of the same color are removed (turned into the background color).\n6.  **Example Walkthrough (train_3)**:\n    *   Input has yellow (4) objects against a white (0) background.\n    *   Objects (using 4-way connectivity):\n        *   A 2-pixel vertical bar at (1,3)-(2,3).\n        *   A 1-pixel object at (2,5).\n        *   A 10-pixel object spanning rows 3 and 4.\n        *   A 1-pixel object at (5,4).\n        *   A 1-pixel object at (6,3).\n    *   The largest object is the 10-pixel one.\n    *   The output retains only this 10-pixel object, with all other pixels set to white (0). This confirms the \"keep largest object\" hypothesis using 4-way connectivity. The other examples (train_1, train_2) also follow this pattern when using 4-way connectivity.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
