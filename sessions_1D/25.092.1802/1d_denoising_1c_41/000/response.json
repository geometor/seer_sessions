These likely represent pixels in a grid, possibly flattened into a single row.\n2.  **Colors**: Each example uses white (0) as the background and one other distinct color: green (3) in train_1, azure (8) in train_2, and magenta (6) in train_3.\n3.  **Transformation**: The transformation seems to involve filtering the non-white pixels. In the input, the non-white color appears in multiple separate contiguous blocks (sequences). In the output, only the *longest* contiguous block of that non-white color from the input is retained. All other pixels, including shorter blocks of the same color and the original white background pixels, become white (0) in the output.\n4.  **Object Identification**: The primary \"objects\" are the contiguous blocks (horizontal segments) of the non-white color. The background (white pixels) can be considered the space in which these objects exist.\n5.  **Key Action**: The core action is identifying and isolating the largest object (longest contiguous block) of the significant color. Other objects of the same color are effectively deleted (turned white).\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
