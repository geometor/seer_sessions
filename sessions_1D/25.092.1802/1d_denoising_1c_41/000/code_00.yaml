task_description: Identify the longest contiguous horizontal segment of the single non-white color present in the input and output only that segment against a white background.

definitions:
  - object:
      description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same non-white color.
      properties:
        - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., green, azure, magenta).
        - length: The number of pixels in the sequence.
        - position: The start and end indices of the sequence in the 1D array.
  - background:
      description: Pixels with the white color (0).

input_characteristics:
  - grid_representation: Flattened 1D array.
  - background_color: Always white (0).
  - object_colors: Exactly one non-white color per input.
  - object_distribution: The non-white color forms one or more contiguous horizontal blocks of varying lengths, separated by white pixels.

output_characteristics:
  - grid_representation: Flattened 1D array, same size as input.
  - background_color: Always white (0).
  - content: Contains only the pixels corresponding to the single longest contiguous block of the non-white color from the input. All other positions are white (0).

transformation:
  - name: Isolate Longest Block
  - steps:
      - Identify the non-white color (C) present in the input.
      - Find all contiguous horizontal blocks of color C.
      - Calculate the length of each block.
      - Determine the maximum length among all blocks.
      - Identify the block(s) having this maximum length. (Assumption: If multiple blocks have the same max length, keep all of them. The examples only show one longest block).
      - Create an output array of the same size as the input, filled with white (0).
      - For the identified longest block(s), copy their pixels (color C) to the corresponding positions in the output array.
