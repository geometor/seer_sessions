            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed because it likely assumed the input was a flat 1D list, while the ARC framework probably provides inputs as 2D grids (even if they only have one row, like `List[List[int]]` or a 2D NumPy array). When the code iterated through the input grid, it treated entire rows as single elements, leading to the \"ambiguous truth value\" error during color comparison (`pixel == target_color`).\n\nThe core logic of identifying the non-white color, finding all its contiguous horizontal segments, determining the maximum segment length, and keeping only the segment(s) with that maximum length appears correct based on the examples.\n\nThe strategy for resolution is to:\n1.  Adapt the code to accept a 2D grid as input.\n2.  Extract the relevant row(s) to operate on. Since all examples show a single row (1xN grid), the primary operation will be on the first row.\n3.  Apply the segment-finding and filtering logic to this row.\n4.  Format the resulting row back into the required 2D output structure.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the visual representation and the likely structure causing the error, we assume the inputs/outputs are 2D grids with a single row.\n\n"
