task_description: Identify the longest contiguous horizontal segment(s) of the single non-white color present in the input grid's row, and output a grid of the same dimensions containing only these longest segment(s) against a white background.

definitions:
  - grid:
      description: A 2D array of pixels, represented as List[List[int]]. In these examples, all grids have a height of 1.
      properties:
        - height: Number of rows.
        - width: Number of columns.
        - pixels: The values (colors 0-9) within the grid.
  - row:
      description: A single horizontal line of pixels within the grid.
  - segment:
      description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same non-white color within a row.
      properties:
        - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., green, azure, magenta).
        - length: The number of pixels in the sequence.
        - position: The start and end column indices of the sequence within its row.
  - background_color:
      description: The color white (0), used for pixels that are not part of the selected longest segment(s).

input_characteristics:
  - structure: 2D grid (List[List[int]] or numpy array).
  - dimensions: Height is 1, width varies (e.g., 1x32).
  - background_color: Always white (0).
  - foreground_colors: Exactly one non-white color per input grid.
  - distribution: The non-white color forms one or more contiguous horizontal segments within the single row, separated by white pixels.

output_characteristics:
  - structure: 2D grid, same dimensions as the input.
  - background_color: Always white (0).
  - content: Contains only the pixels corresponding to the single longest contiguous horizontal segment (or multiple segments if tied for longest) of the non-white color from the input row. All other positions are white (0).

transformation:
  - name: Isolate Longest Horizontal Segment(s) in Row
  - steps:
      - Receive the input grid (assumed H=1, Width=W).
      - Extract the first (and only) row from the input grid.
      - Identify the single non-white color (C) present in the row. If none exists, return a white grid of the same dimensions.
      - Scan the row to find all contiguous horizontal segments composed solely of color C. Record the start index, end index, and length for each segment found.
      - If no segments of color C are found, return a white grid of the same dimensions.
      - Determine the maximum length among all found segments.
      - Identify all segment(s) having this maximum length.
      - Create a new row of the same width as the input row, initially filled entirely with the white color (0).
      - For each identified longest segment, copy its pixels (color C) to the corresponding positions (from start index to end index) in the new row.
      - Construct the output grid by placing the new row as the single row within a 2D structure (List[List[int]]).
      - Return the output grid.
