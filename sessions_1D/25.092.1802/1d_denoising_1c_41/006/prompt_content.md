"""
Identify the single non-white color (C) present in the 1D input sequence. 
Find all contiguous segments (blocks) composed only of color C.
Determine the maximum length among these segments.
Create an output sequence of the same length as the input, initialized to white (0).
Copy only the segment(s) that have the maximum length into the output sequence at their original positions.
If the input is all white or contains no non-white segments, the output is all white.
