task_description: Isolate the longest contiguous horizontal segment(s) of the unique non-white color from the input sequence.

definitions:
  - object:
      description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same non-white color within the 1D input array.
      properties:
        - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., green, azure, magenta). This is constant within a single task example.
        - length: The number of pixels in the sequence (integer > 0).
        - position: The start and end indices (inclusive) of the sequence in the 1D array.
  - background:
      description: Pixels with the white color (0).
  - input_sequence:
      description: A 1D sequence (likely represented as a NumPy array) of pixel colors (integers 0-9).
      properties:
        - contains_background: Typically includes white (0) pixels.
        - contains_objects: Includes one or more 'object' segments of a single non-white color.
  - output_sequence:
      description: A 1D sequence of the same length as the input, representing the transformed grid.
      properties:
        - content: Contains only the pixels corresponding to the longest object segment(s) from the input. All other pixels are the background color (white, 0).

transformation:
  - name: Isolate Longest Segment(s)
  - steps:
      - Identify the unique non-white color (C) present in the input sequence. If no non-white color exists, the output is all white (0).
      - Scan the input sequence to find all contiguous segments ('objects') of color C. Record their start index, end index, and length.
      - Determine the maximum length among all found segments. If no segments are found, the output is all white (0).
      - Identify all segments that have this maximum length.
      - Create an output sequence of the same length as the input, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).
      - For each identified longest segment, copy its pixels (color C) into the corresponding positions (from start index to end index) in the output sequence.
