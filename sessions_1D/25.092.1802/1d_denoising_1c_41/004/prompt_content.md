"""
Identify the longest contiguous horizontal segment(s) of the single non-white color present in the 1D input sequence. 
Output a sequence of the same size containing only these longest segment(s) against a white background (color 0).
If multiple segments share the maximum length, include all of them. 
If the input is all white or contains no non-white segments, return an all-white sequence.
