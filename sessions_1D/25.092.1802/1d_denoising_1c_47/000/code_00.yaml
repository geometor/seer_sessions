Task: Retain the longest contiguous segment of non-white color in a 1D grid.

Input_Components:
  - Type: Grid
    Format: 1D (single row)
    Pixels:
      - Background: White (0)
      - Foreground: Contiguous segments of a single non-white color (e.g., Yellow(4), Azure(8), Green(3))

Output_Components:
  - Type: Grid
    Format: 1D (single row)
    Pixels:
      - Background: White (0)
      - Foreground: The single longest contiguous segment of non-white color from the input grid.

Objects:
  - Name: Non-white segment
    Properties:
      - Color: Any color except White(0)
      - Pixels: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same non-white color.
      - Length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - Position: The starting and ending indices within the row.
  - Name: Background
    Properties:
      - Color: White (0)

Relationships:
  - Contiguity: Pixels of the same non-white color are adjacent horizontally.
  - Comparison: Lengths of different non-white segments are compared.

Actions:
  - Identify: Find all contiguous segments of non-white pixels in the input row.
  - Measure: Determine the length of each identified segment.
  - Select: Choose the segment with the maximum length. (Implicit assumption: if multiple segments have the same maximum length, the examples don't specify tie-breaking, but suggest only one is kept. The simplest interpretation is *a* longest segment).
  - Create: Generate an output row of the same length as the input, initially filled with White (0).
  - Copy: Transfer the pixels of the selected longest segment from the input to their original positions in the output row.

Transformation:
  - Isolate the single longest contiguous block of non-white pixels.
  - Replace all other pixels (original background and shorter non-white blocks) with the background color (White, 0).
