These non-white segments vary in length and color across different examples (yellow, azure, green).\nThe output row retains only the longest contiguous segment of the non-white color from the input row, placed in its original position. All other pixels in the output row, including the original white background pixels and any shorter non-white segments, are turned white (0).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

(Implicit assumption: if multiple segments have the same maximum length, the examples don't specify tie-breaking, but suggest only one is kept. The simplest interpretation is *a* longest segment).\n  - Create: Generate an output row of the same length as the input, initially filled with White (0).\n  - Copy: Transfer the pixels of the selected longest segment from the input to their original positions in the output row.\n\nTransformation:\n  - Isolate the single longest contiguous block of non-white pixels.\n  - Replace all other pixels (original background and shorter non-white blocks) with the background color (White, 0).\n```"

Create a new row of pixels with the same length as the input row, and fill it entirely with white (0) pixels.\n6.
