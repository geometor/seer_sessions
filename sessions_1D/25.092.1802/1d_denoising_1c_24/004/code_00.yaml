task_description: Filters a single-row grid to retain only the longest contiguous horizontal segment(s) of non-white pixels.
grid_properties:
  - input_rows: 1
  - output_rows: 1
  - input_width: variable
  - output_width: equals input_width
objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    location: the single input row
    definition: A maximal contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels.
    attributes:
      - color: non-white
      - start_column: int
      - end_column_exclusive: int
      - length: int (end_column_exclusive - start_column)
derived_properties:
  - name: max_segment_length
    value: The maximum length found among all identified horizontal_segments in the input row. Calculated after identifying all segments. Returns 0 if no non-white segments exist.
transformation:
  - action: create_output_grid
    source: input grid
    properties: same dimensions (1 row, same width), initialized to white (0).
  - action: identify_objects
    target: input grid row
    object_type: horizontal_segment
    result: A list of all horizontal_segments with their properties (color, start, end, length).
  - action: calculate_max_length
    source: list of identified horizontal_segments
    result: The value of max_segment_length.
  - action: filter_and_copy
    target: output grid row
    logic: |
      For each identified horizontal_segment in the input row:
        If the segment's length is equal to max_segment_length:
          Copy the segment (color and position) to the output grid row.
final_state:
  - The output row contains only the horizontal segment(s) from the input row that had the maximum length. All other pixels are white (0).
