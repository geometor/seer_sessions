            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code (`code_00.py`) failed because it implemented an incorrect transformation rule (keeping only the longest segments in the first row) instead of the rule suggested by the examples (filtering first-row segments based on support from the second row). The error message \"The truth value of an array...\" likely arose from applying logic designed for a single row to the two-row input structure inappropriately, although the exact line causing it isn't pinpointed without the execution trace.\n\nThe strategy is to discard the incorrect code and implement the transformation rule derived from the initial analysis, which has now been verified against all three examples. This rule involves:\n1.  Identifying horizontal non-white segments in the first row.\n2.  Checking for corresponding non-white pixels in the second row directly below each segment.\n3.  Copying only the \"supported\" segments (those with non-white pixels below) to the first row of the output.\n4.  Setting the entire second row of the output to white (0).\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nThe following code analyzes each example to confirm the shapes, identify segments, check for support, and verify the output against the intended rule.\n"
