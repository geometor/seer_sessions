Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure**: Both input and output grids consist of exactly two rows. The width varies between examples.
2.  **Color Palette**: The primary colors used are white (0) and one other non-white color per example (azure-8, blue-1).
3.  **Row Roles**:
    *   The **first row** in the input contains one or more horizontal segments of a non-white color, potentially interspersed with white pixels.
    *   The **second row** in the input contains sparse non-white pixels, seemingly acting as markers or selectors, against a white background.
4.  **Transformation Pattern**:
    *   The first row of the output appears to be a *filtered* version of the first row of the input. Some non-white segments from the input's first row are preserved, while others are turned white.
    *   The second row of the output is *always* entirely white, regardless of the input's second row content.
5.  **Filtering Logic**: Comparing input and output first rows alongside the input second row suggests a dependency: A horizontal segment of non-white color in the first row is kept *if and only if* there is at least one non-white pixel directly below it in the second row. If a segment in the first row has only white pixels below it in the second row, that segment is removed (turned white) in the output.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Filters horizontal segments in the first row based on corresponding markers in the second row.
grid_properties:
  - input_rows: 2
  - output_rows: 2
  - input_width: variable
  - output_width: equals input_width
objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    location: first row (row 0)
    definition: A maximal contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels.
    attributes:
      - color: non-white
      - start_column: int
      - end_column: int
  - type: marker
    location: second row (row 1)
    definition: Any non-white pixel.
    attributes:
      - color: non-white (does not need to match segment color)
      - column: int
relationship:
  - type: vertical_alignment
    from: marker (in row 1)
    to: pixel (in row 0)
    condition: The marker and the pixel share the same column index.
  - type: support
    from: marker (in row 1)
    to: horizontal_segment (in row 0)
    condition: A marker exists in row 1 at a column index `c` such that `segment.start_column <= c <= segment.end_column`.
transformation:
  - action: create_output_grid
    source: input grid
    properties: same dimensions, initialized to white (0).
  - action: identify_objects
    target: input grid, first row
    object_type: horizontal_segment
  - action: filter_and_copy
    target: output grid, first row
    logic: |
      For each identified horizontal_segment in the input's first row:
        Check if there exists at least one marker in the input's second row
        that 'supports' the segment (i.e., is located at a column index
        within the segment's horizontal span).
        If such a marker exists, copy the entire horizontal_segment
        to the corresponding position in the output grid's first row.
  - action: clear_row
    target: output grid, second row
    details: Fill the entire second row with white (0) pixels.
final_state:
  - row 0: Contains only the 'supported' horizontal segments from the input's first row.
  - row 1: Contains only white (0) pixels.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new output grid with the same height (2) and width as the input grid, and fill it entirely with the white color (0).
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels in the first row of the input grid. For each segment, note its color, start column index, and end column index.
3.  For each identified segment (spanning columns `start` to `end`):
    a.  Examine the portion of the second row of the *input* grid directly below the segment (i.e., pixels from `input[1][start]` to `input[1][end]`).
    b.  Check if *any* pixel within this examined portion of the second row is non-white.
    c.  If at least one non-white pixel is found below the segment, then copy the original segment (its color and extent from column `start` to `end`) onto the *first* row of the *output* grid at the same position.
4.  Ensure the second row of the output grid consists entirely of white pixels (this was handled by the initialization in step 1 and no modifications were made to the second row).
5.  Return the completed output grid.
```python

2. Identify all maximal contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels in the first row (row 0) of the input grid.
3. For each identified segment:

   b. If any pixel in the second row directly below the segment is non-white (value > 0), then copy the segment from the input's first row to the output's first row.
4. The second row of the output grid remains entirely white (as initialized).
5. Return the output grid.
