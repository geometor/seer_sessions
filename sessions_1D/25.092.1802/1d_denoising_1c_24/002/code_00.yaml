task_description: Filters a single-row grid to keep only the longest contiguous horizontal segment(s) of non-white color.
grid_properties:
  - input_rows: 1
  - output_rows: 1
  - input_width: variable
  - output_width: equals input_width
objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    location: the single input row
    definition: A maximal contiguous sequence of identical non-white pixels.
    attributes:
      - color: non-white
      - start_column: int
      - end_column_exclusive: int
      - length: int (end_column_exclusive - start_column)
transformation:
  - action: create_output_grid
    source: input grid
    properties: same dimensions (1 row, same width), initialized to white (0).
  - action: identify_objects
    target: input grid row
    object_type: horizontal_segment
    result: a list of all horizontal segments.
  - action: find_max_length
    source: list of identified segments
    logic: Determine the maximum length among all identified segments. If no segments exist, max length is 0.
    result: max_segment_length (int).
  - action: filter_and_copy
    target: output grid row
    logic: |
      Iterate through the list of identified horizontal_segments from the input row.
      For each segment:
        If the segment's length is equal to max_segment_length:
          Copy this segment (its color and position) to the output grid row.
  - action: ensure_background
    target: output grid row
    details: All positions not explicitly copied from a max-length segment remain white (0). (Handled by initialization and selective copying).
final_state:
  - The single output row contains only the horizontal segment(s) from the input row that had the overall maximum length. All other pixels are white (0).
