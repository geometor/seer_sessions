```python
import numpy as np

"""
Filters horizontal segments in the first row based on whether any non-white pixel 
exists directly below them in the second row. The second row of the output is 
always white.

1. Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
2. Identify all maximal contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels in the first row (row 0) of the input grid.
3. For each identified segment:
   a. Check the corresponding columns in the second row (row 1) of the input grid.
   b. If any pixel in the second row directly below the segment is non-white (value > 0), then copy the segment from the input's first row to the output's first row.
4. The second row of the output grid remains entirely white (as initialized).
5. Return the output grid.
