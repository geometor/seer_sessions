            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: Both input and output grids consist of exactly two rows. The width varies between examples.\n2.  **Color Palette**: The primary colors used are white (0) and one other non-white color per example (azure-8, blue-1).\n3.  **Row Roles**:\n    *   The **first row** in the input contains one or more horizontal segments of a non-white color, potentially interspersed with white pixels.\n    *   The **second row** in the input contains sparse non-white pixels, seemingly acting as markers or selectors, against a white background.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern**:\n    *   The first row of the output appears to be a *filtered* version of the first row of the input. Some non-white segments from the input's first row are preserved, while others are turned white.\n    *   The second row of the output is *always* entirely white, regardless of the input's second row content.\n5.  **Filtering Logic**: Comparing input and output first rows alongside the input second row suggests a dependency: A horizontal segment of non-white color in the first row is kept *if and only if* there is at least one non-white pixel directly below it in the second row. If a segment in the first row has only white pixels below it in the second row, that segment is removed (turned white) in the output.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
