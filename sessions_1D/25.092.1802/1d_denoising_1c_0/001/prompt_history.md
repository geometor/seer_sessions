*   **Perception:** The input is a 1D sequence of pixel values (colors). The transformation identifies contiguous blocks of non-zero colored pixels within this sequence. It then determines which of these blocks is the longest. The output sequence is constructed by preserving only the pixels belonging to this single longest block, while all other pixels (including those from shorter non-zero blocks and the original background pixels) are set to the background color (0 - white).

        properties:

      - name: find_largest_block
        input: list_of_contiguous_blocks
        output: largest_contiguous_block
        description: Determine the block with the maximum length. If multiple blocks share the maximum length, the examples suggest only one is kept (likely the first one encountered, though this needs confirmation if such cases appear).
      - name: generate_output
        input:
          - input_pixel_sequence_length
          - largest_contiguous_block
        output: output_pixel_sequence
        description: Create a sequence of background_pixels with the same length as the input. Copy the pixels from the identified largest_contiguous_block into the corresponding positions in the new sequence.
    relationships:
      - Pixels belong to blocks.
      - Blocks are compared based on length to find the largest.
      - The output sequence retains only the pixels from the largest input block.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an empty list to store information about contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels found in the input sequence.
    2.  Iterate through the input sequence, identifying the start index, end index, color, and length of each contiguous block of non-zero pixels. Store this information for each block found.
    3.  If no non-zero blocks are found, the output is identical to the input (or a sequence of all zeros of the same length - check examples if this edge case exists. Based on current examples, assume at least one block exists or output is all zeros).
    4.  If blocks are found, identify the block with the maximum length. If there's a tie in length, select the one that appears earliest in the sequence (based on start index).
    5.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, initially filled entirely with the background color (0 - white).
    6.  Copy the pixels corresponding to the selected largest block (using its start index, end index, and color) from the input sequence into the corresponding positions in the output sequence.
    7.  Return the generated output sequence.
