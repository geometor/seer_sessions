"""
Identify all contiguous blocks of non-zero colored pixels in the 1D input sequence. 
Determine the block with the maximum length. If there's a tie, select the one 
that appears earliest (lowest start index). Create an output sequence of the 
same length as the input, filled with the background color (0). Then, copy the 
pixels from the identified longest block into the corresponding positions in 
the output sequence.
