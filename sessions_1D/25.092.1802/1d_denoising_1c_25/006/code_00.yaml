task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a 1xN grid, List[List[int]])
  background_color: white (0)
  input_composition: Contains background color (0) and one or more contiguous segments of a single non-background color. Different examples may use different non-background colors.
  output_composition: Contains background color (0) and only the longest contiguous segment(s) of the non-background color from the input, preserving their original color and position.

objects:
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same non-background color within the single input row.
    properties:
      - color: The integer value (1-9) of the pixels in the segment.
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - position: The starting column index of the segment.

relationships:
  - type: relative_length
    description: Segments can be compared based on their length property.
  - type: maximal_length
    description: One or more segments may share the greatest length among all segments identified in the input row.

actions:
  - action: identify_segments
    description: Scan the input row to find all contiguous segments of non-background pixels. Record their color, starting position, and length.
    inputs: input_row (List[int])
    outputs: list_of_segments (List[Dict{'color', 'start', 'length'}])
  - action: find_max_segment_length
    description: Determine the maximum length value among all identified segments.
    inputs: list_of_segments
    outputs: max_length (int)
  - action: filter_longest_segments
    description: Select only those segments from the list whose length equals the maximum length.
    inputs: list_of_segments, max_length
    outputs: list_of_longest_segments
  - action: construct_output_row
    description: Create a new row of the same length as the input row, initialized entirely with the background color (0).
    inputs: input_row_length (int)
    outputs: output_row (List[int])
  - action: place_longest_segments
    description: For each segment in the list of longest segments, copy its pixels (using its color) into the corresponding positions in the newly created output row.
    inputs: output_row, list_of_longest_segments
    outputs: modified_output_row

transformation:
  rule: Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-background color in the input row. Find the maximum length among these segments. Create a new output row of the same dimensions, filled with the background color. Copy only those segments that have the maximum length from the input row to the output row, preserving their color and original horizontal position. Represent the final row as a list within a list.
