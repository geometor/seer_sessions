**Perception:**

The input consists of a one-dimensional grid (represented as a single row) containing primarily white pixels (0) and segments of a single non-white color (red (2) or azure (8) in the examples). These non-white segments vary in length. The output grid retains only the longest contiguous segment(s) of the non-white color found in the input grid. All other non-white pixels or shorter segments are replaced with the background color (white). The position and color of the longest segment(s) are preserved in the output.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  background_color: white (0)
  input_composition: Contains background color and one other dominant color forming contiguous segments.
  output_composition: Contains background color and potentially one segment of the dominant color from the input.

objects:
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the segment (e.g., red, azure).
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - position: The starting and ending indices of the segment within the grid.

relationships:
  - type: relative_length
    description: Segments can be compared based on their length.
  - type: maximal_length
    description: One or more segments may have the greatest length among all segments of that color in the input grid.

actions:
  - action: identify_segments
    description: Find all contiguous segments of non-white pixels in the input grid.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list_of_segments (with color, length, position)
  - action: find_longest_segment(s)
    description: Determine the maximum length among all identified segments and identify all segments that have this maximum length.
    inputs: list_of_segments
    outputs: list_of_longest_segments
  - action: generate_output
    description: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the background color.
    inputs: input_grid_dimensions
    outputs: output_grid
  - action: place_longest_segment(s)
    description: Copy the pixels of the identified longest segment(s) onto the output grid at their original positions.
    inputs: output_grid, list_of_longest_segments
    outputs: modified_output_grid

transformation:
  rule: Preserve only the longest contiguous segment(s) of the non-white color from the input grid, replacing all other non-white pixels with the background color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid to be the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white).
2.  Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels in the input grid. For each segment, record its color, start position, and length.
3.  If no non-white segments are found, return the initialized white output grid.
4.  Determine the maximum length among all identified segments.
5.  Identify all segments that have this maximum length.
6.  For each segment identified in step 5, copy its pixels (preserving color and position) onto the output grid.
7.  Return the final output grid.
