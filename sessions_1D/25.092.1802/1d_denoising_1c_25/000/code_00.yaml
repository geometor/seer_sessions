task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  background_color: white (0)
  input_composition: Contains background color and one other dominant color forming contiguous segments.
  output_composition: Contains background color and potentially one segment of the dominant color from the input.

objects:
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the segment (e.g., red, azure).
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - position: The starting and ending indices of the segment within the grid.

relationships:
  - type: relative_length
    description: Segments can be compared based on their length.
  - type: maximal_length
    description: One or more segments may have the greatest length among all segments of that color in the input grid.

actions:
  - action: identify_segments
    description: Find all contiguous segments of non-white pixels in the input grid.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list_of_segments (with color, length, position)
  - action: find_longest_segment(s)
    description: Determine the maximum length among all identified segments and identify all segments that have this maximum length.
    inputs: list_of_segments
    outputs: list_of_longest_segments
  - action: generate_output
    description: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the background color.
    inputs: input_grid_dimensions
    outputs: output_grid
  - action: place_longest_segment(s)
    description: Copy the pixels of the identified longest segment(s) onto the output grid at their original positions.
    inputs: output_grid, list_of_longest_segments
    outputs: modified_output_grid

transformation:
  rule: Preserve only the longest contiguous segment(s) of the non-white color from the input grid, replacing all other non-white pixels with the background color.
