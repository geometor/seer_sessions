These non-white segments vary in length. The output grid retains only the longest contiguous segment(s) of the non-white color found in the input grid. All other non-white pixels or shorter segments are replaced with the background color (white). The position and color of the longest segment(s) are preserved in the output.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
