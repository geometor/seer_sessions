task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row, variable width)
  background_color: white (0)
  input_composition: Contains background color and one non-background color forming multiple contiguous horizontal segments of varying lengths.
  output_composition: Contains background color and only the longest contiguous horizontal segment(s) of the non-background color from the input.

objects:
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same non-background color.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the segment (e.g., red (2), azure (8)).
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - position: The starting column index of the segment.

relationships:
  - type: relative_length
    description: Segments can be compared based on their length.
  - type: maximal_length
    description: One or more segments share the greatest length among all segments identified in the input grid.

actions:
  - action: identify_segments
    description: Find all contiguous horizontal segments of non-background pixels in the input row. Record their color, start position, and length.
    inputs: input_row (list of pixel values)
    outputs: list_of_segments
  - action: find_maximum_segment_length
    description: Determine the maximum length among all identified segments.
    inputs: list_of_segments
    outputs: max_length (integer)
  - action: filter_longest_segments
    description: Identify all segments whose length equals the maximum length.
    inputs: list_of_segments, max_length
    outputs: list_of_longest_segments
  - action: generate_output_grid
    description: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized entirely with the background color.
    inputs: input_grid_dimensions
    outputs: output_grid
  - action: place_longest_segments
    description: For each segment in the list of longest segments, copy its pixels (preserving color and original horizontal position) onto the output grid.
    inputs: output_grid, list_of_longest_segments
    outputs: modified_output_grid

transformation:
  rule: Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-background color in the input row. Find the maximum length among these segments. Construct an output row of the same length, initially filled with the background color. Copy only those segments from the input row that have the maximum length into the output row at their original positions.
