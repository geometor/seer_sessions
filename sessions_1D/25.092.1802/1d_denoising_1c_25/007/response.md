"""
Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-background color (0) in the input row. 
Find the maximum length among these segments. Construct an output row of the same length, 
initially filled with the background color (0). Copy only those segments from the 
input row that have the maximum length into the output row at their original positions.
The input and output are represented as a list containing a single list (the row).
