task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a 1-row grid)
  background_color: white (0)
  input_composition: A single row containing background pixels and one or more contiguous segments of non-background pixels. Different non-background colors may exist within the same input, but examples only show one non-background color per input. Segments are separated by at least one background pixel.
  output_composition: A single row containing background pixels and only the segment(s) from the input that had the maximum length among all segments in that input.

objects:
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same non-background color within the input row.
    properties:
      - color: The color code (1-9) of the pixels in the segment.
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment (integer > 0).
      - start_index: The 0-based column index where the segment begins.

relationships:
  - type: maximal_length
    description: The largest length value found among all identified segments in the input row.
  - type: is_longest
    description: A boolean property of a segment, true if its length equals the maximal_length found in the input row.

actions:
  - action: validate_input
    description: Check if the input is a list containing exactly one list (the row).
    inputs: input_grid_list
    outputs: boolean (valid/invalid) or cleaned row data.
  - action: identify_segments
    description: Scan the input row to find all contiguous segments of non-background pixels.
    inputs: input_row (list of ints)
    outputs: list_of_segments (each segment represented by its color, start_index, length)
  - action: find_max_segment_length
    description: Determine the maximum length among all identified segments. If no segments exist, the max length is 0.
    inputs: list_of_segments
    outputs: max_length (integer)
  - action: filter_longest_segments
    description: Select only those segments whose length equals the max_length.
    inputs: list_of_segments, max_length
    outputs: list_of_longest_segments
  - action: construct_output_row
    description: Create a new row of the same length as the input, filled with the background color. Then, place the pixels of each segment from the list_of_longest_segments into this new row at their original start_index positions.
    inputs: input_row_length, background_color, list_of_longest_segments
    outputs: output_row (list of ints)

transformation:
  rule: Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-background colors in the input row. Find the maximum length among these segments. Create an output row of the same size, filled with the background color, and copy only those segments from the input that match the maximum length into the output row, preserving their color and original position.
