Data:
  - Grid Type: 1D Array (single row)
  - Grid Dimensions: Consistent between input and output (e.g., 1x31)
  - Pixel Colors: White (0) and one other non-white color per example.

Input Analysis:
  - Objects:
      - Contiguous segments of the non-white color.
      - Isolated pixels or smaller segments of the non-white color.
      - White background pixels (0).
  - Properties:
      - Each non-white segment has a length (number of contiguous pixels).
  - Relationships:
      - There exists one non-white segment that is longer than all other non-white segments.

Output Analysis:
  - Content: Contains only white pixels (0) and the single longest contiguous segment of the non-white color from the input.
  - Preservation: The position of the longest segment is preserved from the input.
  - Transformation: All pixels not part of the longest contiguous non-white segment in the input are changed to white (0) in the output.

Core Logic:
  - Action: Identify all contiguous segments of the non-white color.
  - Action: Measure the length of each segment.
  - Action: Select the segment with the maximum length.
  - Action: Filter the input grid, keeping only the pixels belonging to the longest segment and replacing all others with white (0).
