## Perception

The input and output are both single-row grids (1D arrays).
Each input grid contains predominantly white pixels (0) and pixels of one other color (azure=8, magenta=6, or green=3).
The non-white pixels appear in both contiguous blocks and as isolated pixels or smaller groups.
The output grid retains only the *longest* contiguous block of the non-white color found in the input grid. All other pixels, including the previously non-white ones that were not part of this longest block, are set to white (0). The position of the longest block remains unchanged relative to the grid boundaries.

## Facts


```yaml
Data:
  - Grid Type: 1D Array (single row)
  - Grid Dimensions: Consistent between input and output (e.g., 1x31)
  - Pixel Colors: White (0) and one other non-white color per example.

Input Analysis:
  - Objects:
      - Contiguous segments of the non-white color.
      - Isolated pixels or smaller segments of the non-white color.
      - White background pixels (0).
  - Properties:
      - Each non-white segment has a length (number of contiguous pixels).
  - Relationships:
      - There exists one non-white segment that is longer than all other non-white segments.

Output Analysis:
  - Content: Contains only white pixels (0) and the single longest contiguous segment of the non-white color from the input.
  - Preservation: The position of the longest segment is preserved from the input.
  - Transformation: All pixels not part of the longest contiguous non-white segment in the input are changed to white (0) in the output.

Core Logic:
  - Action: Identify all contiguous segments of the non-white color.
  - Action: Measure the length of each segment.
  - Action: Select the segment with the maximum length.
  - Action: Filter the input grid, keeping only the pixels belonging to the longest segment and replacing all others with white (0).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the white color (0).
2.  Identify the primary non-white color present in the input grid.
3.  Scan the input grid to find all contiguous horizontal segments composed of this non-white color. Record the start position, end position, and length of each segment.
4.  Determine the segment with the maximum length.
5.  Iterate through the cells corresponding to the identified longest segment (from its start position to its end position).
6.  For each cell within this longest segment's range, copy the non-white color from the input grid to the corresponding cell in the output grid.
7.  Return the completed output grid.

"""
Identify the primary non-white color in the input (a single row grid).
Find all contiguous horizontal segments of this color.
Determine the longest segment among them.
Create an output grid of the same size, initially all white (0).
Copy only the pixels corresponding to the longest segment from the input to the output grid, preserving their position.
All other pixels in the output grid remain white.
