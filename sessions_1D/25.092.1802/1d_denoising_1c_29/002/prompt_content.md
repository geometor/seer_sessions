"""
Identify the primary non-white color in the input (a single row grid).
Find all contiguous horizontal segments of this color.
Determine the longest segment among them.
Create an output grid of the same size, initially all white (0).
Copy only the pixels corresponding to the longest segment from the input to the output grid, preserving their position.
All other pixels in the output grid remain white.
