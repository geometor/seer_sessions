Data:
  - Grid Type: 1D Array (single row), represented as a 2D NumPy array with shape (1, Width).
  - Grid Dimensions: Input and Output have the same shape (1, Width). Width varies per example but was 31 in the provided train examples.
  - Pixel Colors: White (0) and one other non-white color per example (Azure=8, Magenta=6, Green=3 shown).

Input Analysis:
  - Objects:
      - Contiguous horizontal segments of the primary non-white color.
      - Isolated pixels or smaller segments of the non-white color.
      - White background pixels (0).
  - Properties:
      - Each non-white segment has a start index and a length (number of contiguous pixels).
      - One dominant non-white color exists per grid (besides white).
  - Relationships:
      - There may be multiple segments of the non-white color.
      - One of these segments is the longest (or one of the longest, if ties exist).

Output Analysis:
  - Content: Contains only white pixels (0) and the single longest contiguous segment of the non-white color from the input.
  - Preservation: The position (start index and length) of the longest segment is preserved from the input row.
  - Transformation: All pixels *not* part of the single longest contiguous non-white segment in the input row are changed to white (0) in the output row. If multiple segments share the maximum length, the one appearing earliest (leftmost start index) is chosen.

Core Logic:
  - Input Source: A NumPy array of shape (1, Width).
  - Action: Identify the primary non-white color present in the input row.
  - Action: Scan the input row (the first and only row of the NumPy array) to find all contiguous horizontal segments composed of this non-white color. Record the start index and length of each segment.
  - Action: Determine the segment with the maximum length. If there's a tie, select the segment with the smallest start index among those with maximum length.
  - Action: Create an output NumPy array of the same shape as the input, initialized with the white color (0).
  - Action: Copy the pixels belonging to the selected longest segment from the input row to the corresponding positions in the output row.
  - Output Target: The modified NumPy array.
