task_description: Identify and isolate the largest contiguous object of a specific color, removing all smaller objects of the same color.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensionality: appears 1D (1xN), but likely represents 2D context
      - background_color: white (0)
  - type: object
    properties:
      - definition: contiguous block of non-white pixels
      - features:
          - color: the specific non-white color in the grid (e.g., yellow, blue, red)
          - size: number of pixels in the contiguous block
          - location: position within the grid
    relationships:
      - comparison: objects of the same color are compared based on size
      - spatial: objects are separated by background pixels

transformation:
  action: filtering based on size
  steps:
    - identify_objects: Find all connected components (objects) of non-white pixels.
    - group_by_color: (Implicit) All non-white objects in these examples share the same color.
    - calculate_size: Determine the size (pixel count) for each object.
    - find_largest: Identify the object with the maximum size. Assume a single largest object based on examples.
    - filter: Keep only the pixels belonging to the largest object.
    - replace_others: Change the color of all pixels belonging to non-largest objects to the background color (white/0).
  preserves:
    - dimensions of the grid
    - color and position of pixels in the largest object
    - color and position of original background pixels

assumptions:
  - There is only one non-white color present in each input grid.
  - There is a single, uniquely largest object of that color.
  - Connectivity is defined by adjacent (horizontal/vertical) pixels of the same color.
