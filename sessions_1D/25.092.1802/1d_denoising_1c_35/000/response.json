One group is significantly larger (a contiguous block) than the others. The other groups are smaller, often just single pixels of the primary color, scattered within the white background.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation consistently preserves the largest contiguous block of the primary color. All other instances of the primary color (the smaller, scattered groups) are removed and replaced with the background color (white/0). The positions of the pixels within the largest block and the background pixels that were already white remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
