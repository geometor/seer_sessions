All other pixels in the output grid, including those that were part of smaller non-white objects or the original background, are set to white (0).\n    *   The position and color of the largest object are preserved from the input to the output.\n    *   The process seems independent of the specific non-white color used.\n    *   Ambiguity exists in the provided flat string representations regarding grid dimensions (e.g., 31 elements could be 1x31 or 31x1, 32 elements could be 4x8, 8x4, etc.). However, the core logic of identifying and isolating the largest contiguous non-white object appears consistent across potential interpretations (1D or 2D). Connectivity for identifying contiguous blocks is assumed to be 4-directional (up, down, left, right).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
