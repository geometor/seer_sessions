task_type: array_transformation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as 2D with height 1)
grid_size: fixed (1x33 for all examples)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    color: non-white (varies per example: 8, 1, 4)
    properties:
      - length (number of pixels)
      - position (start and end index)
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    attribute: length
    among: non-white_contiguous_blocks
    criterion: maximum
action:
  - type: identify
    target: largest non-white contiguous block
  - type: preserve
    target: pixels within the largest block
  - type: change_color
    target: all other pixels
    to_color: white (0)
result: Output grid contains only the largest non-white block from the input, surrounded by white pixels.
