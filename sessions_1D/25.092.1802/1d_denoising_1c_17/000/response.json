All examples have the same width (33 pixels).\n2.  **Colors:** Each example uses white (0) and one other color: azure (8) in train_1, blue (1) in train_2, and yellow (4) in train_3.\n3.  **Input Pattern:** The input grids contain contiguous blocks of a non-white color, separated by white pixels. Some non-white blocks are extended (length > 1), while others are isolated single pixels (length = 1).\n4.  **Output Pattern:** The output grid retains only *one* contiguous block of the non-white color from the input. All other pixels, including isolated non-white pixels and other non-white blocks from the input, are turned white (0).\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation identifies the *largest* contiguous block of the non-white color in the input row and preserves it in the output. All other positions in the output row become white (0). The specific non-white color is maintained within the preserved block.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Find the block with the maximum length among all identified non-white blocks. If there's a tie in length, any one of the longest blocks can be chosen (though the examples don't show ties).\n3.  Create a new output row of the same size as the input, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n4.
