Identify all contiguous horizontal blocks of non-white pixels in the input row. Find the block with the maximum length. Create a new output row of the same size as the input, filled with white (0). Copy the pixels corresponding to the position and color of the single largest non-white block to the corresponding positions in the new output row.
