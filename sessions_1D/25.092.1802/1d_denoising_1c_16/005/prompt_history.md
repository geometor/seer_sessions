*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example (5x7).
    *   The grids primarily consist of white pixels (0) and one other dominant color (orange - 7, or azure - 8).
    *   A key feature in the input grids is the presence of one or more rows completely filled with a single non-white color.
    *   In the output grids, only these solid-colored rows (or the largest contiguous block of them) are preserved from the input. All other rows are replaced entirely with white pixels (0).
    *   The transformation identifies the largest contiguous horizontal block of rows where each row consists of only one non-white color, preserves this block, and sets all other pixels in the grid to white.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Identify the largest contiguous block of solid, non-white rows and preserve only that block, turning everything else white.
    grid_properties:
      - dimensions_match: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
      - colors_present_input: White (0) and one other non-white color (e.g., 7, 8).
      - colors_present_output: White (0) and the single non-white color identified in the input's solid rows.
    objects:
      - type: solid_row
        description: A row consisting entirely of a single non-white color.
        example_colors: [7, 8]
      - type: solid_block
        description: A contiguous vertical group of one or more solid_rows of the same non-white color.
        relation: This is the primary object to be preserved.
      - type: background
        description: Pixels not part of the identified solid_block.
        color_in_output: white (0)
    actions:
      - identify: Scan each row of the input grid.
      - filter: Keep rows that are composed of a single, non-white color.
      - group: Find contiguous vertical blocks of these solid rows sharing the same color.
      - select: Choose the largest contiguous block (by height/number of rows). If there's a tie, the specific examples don't show how to resolve it, but typically the first or last encountered might be chosen (the examples only show one such block).
      - construct_output: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
      - copy: Transfer the selected largest solid block from the input grid to the corresponding position in the output grid.
    relationships:
      - contiguity: Rows must be vertically adjacent to form a block.
      - uniformity: Rows within a block must be solid and of the same non-white color.
      - preservation: Only the largest solid block is kept; everything else is discarded/replaced.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with white pixels (color 0).
    2.  Iterate through the rows of the input grid to identify all rows that consist of a single, non-white color. Record the row index and the color for each such solid row.
    3.  Group the identified solid rows based on vertical contiguity and having the same color. This identifies blocks of solid-colored rows.
    4.  Determine the largest block (the one with the most rows). If there is only one block, select that one. (The provided examples only show cases with one identifiable block).
    5.  If a largest solid block is found, copy the pixels corresponding to this block from the input grid to the same row and column positions in the output grid.
    6.  The output grid, now containing the copied solid block (if found) and white pixels elsewhere, is the result.

**General Assessment:**

The provided Python code failed on all training examples, consistently producing an all-white grid instead of the expected output. The simulation results using `tool_code` demonstrate that the core logic of the Python code (identifying solid rows, grouping them into blocks, finding the largest block, and copying it) is actually correct *if* the input data is correctly shaped into a 2D grid (5x7 in these examples). The simulation outputs match the expected outputs for all three training examples when the input is reshaped appropriately.

The failure reported by the test execution environment strongly suggests that the `transform` function received the input grid as a flat 1D list instead of the expected 2D `List[List[int]]`. The `np.array()` function, when given a flat list, creates a 1D array, causing subsequent row-based operations and shape assumptions in the code to fail, leading to no block being identified and an all-white grid being returned.

The strategy is to maintain the current core logic, as it correctly reflects the transformation rule derived from the examples. The natural language program and facts should be refined for clarity, but the underlying algorithm appears sound. No changes to the Python code's logic are proposed, assuming the execution environment will provide correctly shaped 2D input in future tests.

**Metrics:**

| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Solid Rows Found (index, color) | Blocks Found (start, end, color, height) | Largest Block | Code Output (Simulated) | Expected Output | Match (Simulated) | Original Test Result | Likely Cause of Failure |
| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------- | :------------ | :---------------------- | :-------------- | :---------------- | :------------------- | :---------------------- |
| Train 1 | 5x7         | 5x7          | `[(0, 7), (1, 7)]`              | `[(0, 1, 7, 2)]`                         | `(0, 1, 7, 2)` | Rows 0,1 Orange       | Rows 0,1 Orange | True              | All White (Fail)     | Input shape mismatch    |
| Train 2 | 5x7 (Note 1)| 5x7          | `[(1, 8), (2, 8)]`              | `[(1, 2, 8, 2)]`                         | `(1, 2, 8, 2)` | Rows 1,2 Azure        | Rows 1,2 Azure  | True              | All White (Fail)     | Input shape mismatch    |
| Train 3 | 5x7         | 5x7          | `[(1, 8), (2, 8)]`              | `[(1, 2, 8, 2)]`                         | `(1, 2, 8, 2)` | Rows 1,2 Azure        | Rows 1,2 Azure  | True              | All White (Fail)     | Input shape mismatch    |

*Note 1: The flat input string provided for Train 2 in the initial prompt had 32 elements, inconsistent with a 5x7 grid. The analysis assumes the intended input follows the pattern and fits a 5x7 grid, yielding solid rows 1 and 2.*

**Facts:**

```
yaml
task_description: Identify the largest contiguous vertical block of solid, identically colored, non-white rows in the input grid. Create an output grid of the same dimensions, initially all white, and copy only this largest block into the corresponding position.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_match: Input and output grids must have the same height and width.
  - dimensions_example: All training examples use 5x7 grids.
  - colors_present_input: White (0) and at least one non-white color (e.g., orange-7, azure-8). May contain multiple non-white colors, but only one color will form the target block.
  - colors_present_output: White (0) and the single non-white color of the largest identified solid block. If no block is found, only white (0).
objects:
  - type: solid_row
    description: A row in the grid composed entirely of a single non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The non-white color filling the row.
      - index: The row number within the grid.
  - type: solid_block
    description: A vertically contiguous sequence of one or more solid_rows that all share the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The non-white color of all rows in the block.
      - start_row: The index of the first row in the block.
      - end_row: The index of the last row in the block.
      - height: The number of rows in the block (end_row - start_row + 1).
  - type: background
    description: All pixels in the grid that are not part of the selected largest solid_block.
    color_in_output: white (0)
actions:
  - identify_solid_rows: Scan each row of the input grid. If a row contains only one unique color and that color is not white (0), record its index and color.
  - group_blocks: Iterate through the identified solid rows. Group consecutive rows that are vertically adjacent (index difference is 1) and have the same color into blocks. Record the start row, end row, color, and height for each block.
  - select_largest_block: Compare all identified blocks based on their height. Select the block with the maximum height. If multiple blocks share the maximum height, select the one that appears first (lowest start_row index).
  - construct_output: Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
  - copy_block: If a largest solid block was selected, copy the pixels corresponding to this block (from start_row to end_row) from the input grid to the same row and column positions in the output grid.
relationships:
  - contiguity: Rows must be vertically adjacent (row indices differ by 1) to form part of the same block.
  - uniformity: All rows within a single block must consist of the same non-white color.
  - maximality: The block chosen for preservation is the one with the greatest height.
  - preservation: Only the single largest solid block is kept; all other pixels become white.
