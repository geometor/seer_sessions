*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example (5x7).
    *   The grids primarily consist of white pixels (0) and one other dominant color (orange - 7, or azure - 8).
    *   A key feature in the input grids is the presence of one or more rows completely filled with a single non-white color.
    *   In the output grids, only these solid-colored rows (or the largest contiguous block of them) are preserved from the input. All other rows are replaced entirely with white pixels (0).
    *   The transformation identifies the largest contiguous horizontal block of rows where each row consists of only one non-white color, preserves this block, and sets all other pixels in the grid to white.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Identify the largest contiguous block of solid, non-white rows and preserve only that block, turning everything else white.
    grid_properties:
      - dimensions_match: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
      - colors_present_input: White (0) and one other non-white color (e.g., 7, 8).
      - colors_present_output: White (0) and the single non-white color identified in the input's solid rows.
    objects:
      - type: solid_row
        description: A row consisting entirely of a single non-white color.
        example_colors: [7, 8]
      - type: solid_block
        description: A contiguous vertical group of one or more solid_rows of the same non-white color.
        relation: This is the primary object to be preserved.
      - type: background
        description: Pixels not part of the identified solid_block.
        color_in_output: white (0)
    actions:
      - identify: Scan each row of the input grid.
      - filter: Keep rows that are composed of a single, non-white color.
      - group: Find contiguous vertical blocks of these solid rows sharing the same color.
      - select: Choose the largest contiguous block (by height/number of rows). If there's a tie, the specific examples don't show how to resolve it, but typically the first or last encountered might be chosen (the examples only show one such block).
      - construct_output: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
      - copy: Transfer the selected largest solid block from the input grid to the corresponding position in the output grid.
    relationships:
      - contiguity: Rows must be vertically adjacent to form a block.
      - uniformity: Rows within a block must be solid and of the same non-white color.
      - preservation: Only the largest solid block is kept; everything else is discarded/replaced.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with white pixels (color 0).
    2.  Iterate through the rows of the input grid to identify all rows that consist of a single, non-white color. Record the row index and the color for each such solid row.
    3.  Group the identified solid rows based on vertical contiguity and having the same color. This identifies blocks of solid-colored rows.
    4.  Determine the largest block (the one with the most rows). If there is only one block, select that one. (The provided examples only show cases with one identifiable block).
    5.  If a largest solid block is found, copy the pixels corresponding to this block from the input grid to the same row and column positions in the output grid.
    6.  The output grid, now containing the copied solid block (if found) and white pixels elsewhere, is the result.
