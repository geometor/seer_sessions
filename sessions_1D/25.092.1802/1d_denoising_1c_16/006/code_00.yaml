task_description: Identify the largest contiguous vertical block of solid, identically colored, non-white rows in the input grid. Preserve only this block in the output grid, setting all other pixels to white (0).
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_match: Input and output grids have the same height and width (assumed 5x7 based on examples).
  - background_color: White (0) is the background color and the fill color for non-preserved areas.
  - colors_present_input: White (0) and typically one other non-white color forming solid rows (e.g., Orange-7, Azure-8). Other non-white pixels might exist in non-solid rows.
  - colors_present_output: White (0) and the single non-white color of the preserved block.
objects:
  - type: solid_row
    description: A row consisting entirely of a single color that is not white (0).
    properties:
      - color: The non-white color filling the row.
      - row_index: The vertical position of the row.
  - type: solid_block
    description: A vertically contiguous sequence of one or more solid_rows that all share the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - start_row: The row index of the top-most row in the block.
      - end_row: The row index of the bottom-most row in the block.
      - color: The single non-white color shared by all rows in the block.
      - height: The number of rows in the block (end_row - start_row + 1).
  - type: background
    description: Pixels in the output grid that are not part of the preserved solid_block.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
actions:
  - identify_solid_rows: Scan each row of the input grid. If a row contains pixels of only one color and that color is not white (0), record its row index and color.
  - group_blocks: Examine the identified solid rows. Group consecutive rows that are vertically adjacent and have the same color into solid_blocks.
  - select_largest_block: Compare all identified solid_blocks based on their height. Select the block with the maximum height.
  - tie_breaking: If multiple blocks share the maximum height, select the block with the smallest start_row index (the one appearing highest in the grid).
  - construct_output: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with white (0).
  - copy_block: If a largest solid block was selected, copy the pixels corresponding to this block (from start_row to end_row) from the input grid to the same location in the output grid. If no solid block was found, the output remains all white.
relationships:
  - contiguity: Solid rows must be vertically adjacent (row indices differ by 1) to belong to the same block.
  - uniformity: All solid rows within a single block must have the same non-white color.
  - maximality: The selection criterion prioritizes the block with the greatest height.
  - positional_preference: Tie-breaking for height favors the block appearing earliest (top-most) in the grid.
