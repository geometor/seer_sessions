"""
Identify the largest contiguous vertical block of solid, identically colored, non-white rows in the input grid. 
A solid row consists entirely of a single color that is not white (0).
A block is a vertically contiguous sequence of solid rows that all share the same non-white color.
The largest block is defined as the one with the greatest height (number of rows). If there is a tie in height, 
the block appearing earliest in the grid (lowest starting row index) is chosen.
Preserve only this largest block in the output grid, setting all other pixels to white (0).
If no solid rows or blocks are found, the output grid is entirely white.
