The input grid features one large contiguous horizontal block of the foreground color and several isolated pixels or very small blocks of the same foreground color scattered around. The transformation isolates the largest contiguous block of the foreground color, removing all other instances of that color by changing them to the background color.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
