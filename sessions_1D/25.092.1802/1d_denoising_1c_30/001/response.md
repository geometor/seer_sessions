Identify all contiguous horizontal segments (blocks) of non-white pixels in the input row. 
Determine the block with the maximum length. 
Create an output row of the same length, filled with the background color (white, 0). 
Copy the pixels corresponding to the identified largest block from the input row to the output row at the same positions, leaving all other pixels as the background color.
