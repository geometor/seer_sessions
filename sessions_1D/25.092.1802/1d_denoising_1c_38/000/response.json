Each input row consists of pixels of two colors: a background color (white, represented by 0) and a single foreground color (yellow, blue, or azure in the examples). The foreground color appears in multiple, separate contiguous blocks of varying lengths within the input row.\n\nThe transformation identifies the *longest* contiguous block of the foreground color within the input row. The output row is constructed to be the same length as the input. This longest foreground block is preserved in its original position in the output row. All other pixels in the output row, including those that were part of shorter foreground blocks or the original background in the input, are set to the background color (white, 0).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
