task_type: object_selection_and_filtering
input_features:
  - grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - foreground_color: single non-white color (varies per example)
  - foreground_pixels_form_blocks: Yes, multiple contiguous blocks of the foreground color exist.
  - block_properties:
      - contiguity: horizontal
      - size: variable length
output_features:
  - grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
  - dimensions: same as input row length
  - background_color: white (0)
  - foreground_color: same as input foreground color
  - foreground_pixels_form_blocks: Yes, exactly one contiguous block of the foreground color exists.
relationship_input_output:
  - preservation: The single output foreground block corresponds exactly in color, size, and position to the largest foreground block found in the input.
  - modification: All pixels in the output that do not belong to the preserved largest block are set to the background color (white, 0).
objects:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
  - object: foreground_block
    definition: A maximal contiguous sequence of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: non-white (consistent within a block and within an example)
      - length: number of pixels in the sequence
  - object: target_block
    definition: The foreground_block with the maximum length in the input.
actions:
  - identify_foreground_color: Determine the non-white color present in the input.
  - find_contiguous_blocks: Locate all contiguous sequences (blocks) of the foreground color in the input row.
  - measure_block_length: Calculate the length of each identified foreground block.
  - select_largest_block: Identify the foreground block with the maximum length. If multiple blocks share the maximum length, the examples suggest any one will suffice (implicitly, perhaps the first one encountered).
  - create_output_row: Initialize a new row of the same length as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
  - copy_target_block: Copy the pixels of the selected largest block from the input into the corresponding positions in the output row.
