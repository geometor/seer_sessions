Transforms a single-row input grid by identifying the longest contiguous block 
of the foreground color (the single non-zero color present). The output grid 
is the same length as the input, containing only this longest block in its 
original position. All other pixels in the output are set to the background 
color (white, 0). If no foreground color exists in the input, the output 
is entirely the background color.
