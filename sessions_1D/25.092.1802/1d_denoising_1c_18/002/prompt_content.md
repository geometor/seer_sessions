"""
Identify all contiguous blocks of non-background (non-white, non-0) pixels in the 1D input grid.
Determine the size (length) of each block.
Find the block with the maximum size.
Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).
Copy the pixels of the largest identified block from the input grid to their original positions in the output grid.
If multiple blocks share the maximum size, the examples suggest only one is present, but implicitly the first one encountered during iteration would be chosen.
If no non-background blocks exist, the output remains entirely background color.
