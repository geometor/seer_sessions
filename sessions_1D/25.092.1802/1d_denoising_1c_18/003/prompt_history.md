*   **Perception:** The input grids are one-dimensional arrays (or 1xN grids) containing mostly white pixels (0) and one other color (red, yellow, or blue in the examples). Each input grid features one large contiguous block of the non-white color and several isolated single pixels of the same color. The output grid retains only the largest contiguous block of the non-white color, positioned exactly as it was in the input. All other pixels, including the previously isolated non-white pixels and all original white pixels, become white in the output. The transformation identifies and isolates the single largest contiguous segment of non-background color, discarding all smaller segments and isolated pixels of that color.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
*   **General Assessment:**
    The primary issue stems from an incorrect assumption about the input data structure. The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly indicates that the `transform` function received a multi-dimensional array (likely a 1xN NumPy array or list of lists) instead of the flat list it was designed to process based on the initial string representation. The core logic of identifying contiguous blocks, finding the largest, and reconstructing the output seems conceptually sound for the task, but it needs to be adapted to handle the actual 2D grid input format provided by the ARC framework, even when the grid dimensions are 1xN. The strategy is to adjust the data handling within the function to correctly process the first row of the 2D input grid.

*   **Metrics:**
    To confirm the input/output structure, let's analyze the examples assuming they follow the standard ARC format (list of lists).
