Each input grid features one large contiguous block of the non-white color and several isolated single pixels of the same color. The output grid retains only the largest contiguous block of the non-white color, positioned exactly as it was in the input. All other pixels, including the previously isolated non-white pixels and all original white pixels, become white in the output. The transformation identifies and isolates the single largest contiguous segment of non-background color, discarding all smaller segments and isolated pixels of that color.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
