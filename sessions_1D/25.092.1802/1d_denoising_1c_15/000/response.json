The grids contain a background color (white - 0) and one other primary color (azure - 8, gray - 5, or red - 2). The input grid features several distinct contiguous groups (objects) of the primary color, separated by the background color. The output grid retains only one of these objects \u2013 specifically, the largest one in terms of pixel count. All other pixels in the output grid, including those that were part of smaller primary-colored objects in the input, are set to the background color (white - 0). Connectivity for defining objects appears to be based on orthogonal adjacency (sharing a side), not diagonal.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
