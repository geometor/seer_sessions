Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure**: Each example pair consists of a 1-dimensional input grid (a single row) and a corresponding 1-dimensional output grid of the same size.
2.  **Colors**: The grids use white (0) as the background color and one other color for foreground elements (green (3), orange (7), or red (2)).
3.  **Input Content**: The input grids contain one or more contiguous horizontal blocks (segments) of the foreground color, along with some isolated single pixels of the same foreground color, separated by the white background color.
4.  **Output Content**: The output grids contain only *one* contiguous horizontal block of the foreground color, corresponding to the *longest* such block found in the input grid. All other pixels, including shorter blocks and isolated foreground pixels from the input, are replaced with the white background color in the output.
5.  **Transformation**: The core transformation identifies all contiguous blocks of the non-white color in the input, measures their length (size), finds the longest block, and isolates it in the output grid, turning everything else white.

**Facts (YAML)**

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct contiguous blocks (sequences) of non-background colored pixels. Record the color, start index, end index, and size (length) of each block.
3.  Compare the sizes of all identified blocks and determine the maximum size.
4.  Find the block (or potentially blocks, though examples only show one) that has this maximum size. If there are multiple blocks of the maximum size, assume for now we select the first one encountered during the scan (e.g., the leftmost one).
5.  For the selected largest block(s), copy the pixels (with their original color and positions) from the input grid to the corresponding positions in the output grid.
6.  Return the modified output grid.

## Example 3:

**Assessment and Strategy**

The analysis confirms that the core transformation logic derived previously (identify all contiguous blocks of non-background color, find the longest one, and output only that block on a background grid) is correct and consistent across all three training examples. The execution error reported (`The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...`) strongly indicates an implementation issue, likely stemming from the way the testing environment provides the input grid (possibly as a NumPy array instead of a standard Python list) and how the provided Python code interacted with that data type.

The strategy is to:
1.  Maintain the validated transformation logic.
2.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program for clarity and completeness based on the confirmed understanding.
3.  Inform the Coder phase that the implementation needs to be robust to the input data type, specifically handling potential NumPy arrays correctly during iteration and comparison, to resolve the execution error.

**Metrics**

The `tool_code` execution validated the following:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Length: 33
    *   Blocks: `[(3, 4, 4, 1), (3, 8, 8, 1), (3, 11, 11, 1), (3, 15, 15, 1), (3, 17, 28, 12), (3, 31, 31, 1)]`
    *   Max Size: 12
    *   Largest Block (first): `(3, 17, 28, 12)`
    *   Generated Output matches Expected Output: True
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Length: 33
    *   Blocks: `[(7, 3, 3, 1), (7, 8, 8, 1), (7, 11, 24, 14), (7, 27, 27, 1)]`
    *   Max Size: 14
    *   Largest Block (first): `(7, 11, 24, 14)`
    *   Generated Output matches Expected Output: True
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Length: 33
    *   Blocks: `[(2, 2, 2, 1), (2, 5, 5, 1), (2, 10, 23, 14), (2, 27, 27, 1), (2, 30, 30, 1)]`
    *   Max Size: 14
    *   Largest Block (first): `(2, 10, 23, 14)`
    *   Generated Output matches Expected Output: True

This confirms the logic described in the Natural Language Program is accurate for all training cases.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input row (a 1D grid). Note its size.
2.  Define the background color as white (0).
3.  Create an output row of the same size as the input, initially filled entirely with the background color.
4.  Scan the input row from left to right to identify all contiguous blocks (sequences) of non-background colored pixels. For each block, record its color, start index, end index, and calculate its size (length = end index - start index + 1).
5.  If no non-background blocks are found, return the background-filled output row.
6.  Determine the maximum size among all identified blocks.
7.  Find the first block (the one with the smallest start index) that has this maximum size.
8.  Copy the pixels belonging to this single selected block (using its color, start index, and end index) from the input row into the corresponding positions in the output row, overwriting the background color pixels.
9.  Return the completed output row.
