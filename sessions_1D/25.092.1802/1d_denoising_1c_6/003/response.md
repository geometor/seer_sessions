"""
Transformation Rule: Identify all contiguous horizontal blocks of non-background color
(color != 0) in the input grid (which is a single row/1D list). Find the block 
with the maximum length (size). If multiple blocks share the same maximum length,
select the one that appears first (leftmost, smallest starting index). Create an 
output grid of the same size as the input, filled entirely with the background 
color (0), and then place the pixels of the selected largest block into the 
output grid at their original positions, preserving their original color.
