Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure**: Each example pair consists of a 1-dimensional input grid (a single row) and a corresponding 1-dimensional output grid of the same size.
2.  **Colors**: The grids use white (0) as the background color and one other color for foreground elements (green (3), orange (7), or red (2)).
3.  **Input Content**: The input grids contain one or more contiguous horizontal blocks (segments) of the foreground color, along with some isolated single pixels of the same foreground color, separated by the white background color.
4.  **Output Content**: The output grids contain only *one* contiguous horizontal block of the foreground color, corresponding to the *longest* such block found in the input grid. All other pixels, including shorter blocks and isolated foreground pixels from the input, are replaced with the white background color in the output.
5.  **Transformation**: The core transformation identifies all contiguous blocks of the non-white color in the input, measures their length (size), finds the longest block, and isolates it in the output grid, turning everything else white.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1 # Primarily 1D examples shown (single row)
  background_color: 0 # white
  foreground_colors: [3, 7, 2] # Green, Orange, Red observed in examples
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    description: A sequence of one or more adjacent non-background pixels in the row.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (always non-white).
      - size: The number of pixels in the block (its length).
      - location: The starting and ending indices of the block within the row.
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    description: Blocks are compared based on their size (length).
action:
  - type: identification
    description: Identify all contiguous blocks of non-background color in the input grid.
  - type: measurement
    description: Determine the size (length) of each identified block.
  - type: filtering
    description: Select the block with the maximum size.
  - type: construction
    description: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.
  - type: placement
    description: Place the pixels of the largest identified block into the new grid at their original locations.
transformation_goal: Isolate the single largest contiguous block of non-background color from the input grid, removing all other non-background elements.
assumptions:
  - There is a unique largest block. (The examples do not demonstrate tie-breaking).
  - Contiguity is defined by horizontal adjacency in these 1D examples.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct contiguous blocks (sequences) of non-background colored pixels. Record the color, start index, end index, and size (length) of each block.
3.  Compare the sizes of all identified blocks and determine the maximum size.
4.  Find the block (or potentially blocks, though examples only show one) that has this maximum size. If there are multiple blocks of the maximum size, assume for now we select the first one encountered during the scan (e.g., the leftmost one).
5.  For the selected largest block(s), copy the pixels (with their original color and positions) from the input grid to the corresponding positions in the output grid.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
