task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1 # Input/Output are single rows (1D arrays)
  grid_size: variable # Observed lengths are 33 (corrected from initial analysis)
  background_color: 0 # white
  foreground_colors: [3, 7, 2] # Green, Orange, Red observed in examples
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    description: A horizontally contiguous sequence of one or more pixels of the same non-background color.
    properties:
      - color: The single color composing the block.
      - size: The number of pixels (length) of the block.
      - location: The start and end indices of the block within the row.
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    description: Contiguous blocks are compared based on their size (length).
action:
  - type: identification
    description: Identify all distinct contiguous blocks of non-background color in the input row.
  - type: measurement
    description: Determine the size (length) of each identified block.
  - type: filtering
    description: Select the block(s) with the maximum size. If multiple blocks share the maximum size, select the first one encountered (leftmost).
  - type: construction
    description: Create a new row of the same size as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
  - type: placement
    description: Copy the pixels (color and position) of the selected largest block from the input row to the corresponding positions in the newly constructed output row.
transformation_goal: Isolate the single, leftmost, longest contiguous block of non-background color from the input row, replacing all other pixels with the background color.
assumptions:
  - Input and output grids are 1D arrays (single rows).
  - Contiguity is defined strictly by horizontal adjacency.
  - Blocks consist of a single non-background color.
  - There is always a single background color (0).
  - If multiple blocks share the maximum length, the leftmost one (smallest starting index) is the target.
