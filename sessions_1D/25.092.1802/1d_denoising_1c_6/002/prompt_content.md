Transformation Rule: Identify all contiguous horizontal blocks of non-background color
in the input grid (which is a single row). Find the block with the maximum length.
Create an output grid of the same size, filled with the background color (0),
and place the pixels of the largest block found into the output grid at their
original positions. If there are multiple blocks of the same maximum length,
keep only the first one encountered (leftmost). All other pixels in the output
remain the background color.
