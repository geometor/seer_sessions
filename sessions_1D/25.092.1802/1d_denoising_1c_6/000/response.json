All other pixels, including shorter blocks and isolated foreground pixels from the input, are replaced with the white background color in the output.\n5.  **Transformation**: The core transformation identifies all contiguous blocks of the non-white color in the input, measures their length (size), finds the longest block, and isolates it in the output grid, turning everything else white.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
