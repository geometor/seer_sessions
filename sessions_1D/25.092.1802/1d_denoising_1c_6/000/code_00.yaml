task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 1 # Primarily 1D examples shown (single row)
  background_color: 0 # white
  foreground_colors: [3, 7, 2] # Green, Orange, Red observed in examples
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    description: A sequence of one or more adjacent non-background pixels in the row.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the block (always non-white).
      - size: The number of pixels in the block (its length).
      - location: The starting and ending indices of the block within the row.
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    description: Blocks are compared based on their size (length).
action:
  - type: identification
    description: Identify all contiguous blocks of non-background color in the input grid.
  - type: measurement
    description: Determine the size (length) of each identified block.
  - type: filtering
    description: Select the block with the maximum size.
  - type: construction
    description: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.
  - type: placement
    description: Place the pixels of the largest identified block into the new grid at their original locations.
transformation_goal: Isolate the single largest contiguous block of non-background color from the input grid, removing all other non-background elements.
assumptions:
  - There is a unique largest block. (The examples do not demonstrate tie-breaking).
  - Contiguity is defined by horizontal adjacency in these 1D examples.
