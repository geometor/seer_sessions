task_description: Identify the longest contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels in the input row and keep only that block in the output, setting all other pixels to white.
elements:
  - element_type: grid
    properties:
      dimensionality: 1D (single row)
      background_color: white (0)
  - element_type: object
    properties:
      definition: A contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels.
      color: Varies (e.g., red=2, orange=7)
      attribute: length (number of pixels in the sequence)
relationships:
  - type: separation
    description: Non-white blocks are separated by one or more white pixels.
  - type: comparison
    description: The lengths of the non-white blocks are compared.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: contiguous blocks of non-white pixels
  - action: measure
    target: length of each identified block
  - action: find_maximum
    target: block length
    result: the longest block(s)
  - action: filter/select
    description: Keep only the pixels belonging to the uniquely longest block.
  - action: modify
    target: all other pixels (including those in shorter non-white blocks)
    change: set color to white (0)
inferred_rule: The output grid retains only the pixels corresponding to the single longest contiguous block of non-white pixels found in the input grid. All other positions are set to white.
uncertainties:
  - How to handle ties if multiple blocks share the maximum length (not covered by examples). The current interpretation assumes a unique longest block exists or only pixels from *the* single longest block are kept.
