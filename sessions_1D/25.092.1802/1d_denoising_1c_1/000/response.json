These blocks are separated by one or more white pixels.\n4.  **Transformation**: The transformation involves identifying these non-white blocks, comparing their lengths (number of contiguous pixels), and selectively keeping only the pixels belonging to the longest block. All other pixels in the output grid become white (0).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
