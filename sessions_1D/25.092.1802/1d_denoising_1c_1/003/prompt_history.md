**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure**: The input and output are single rows (1-dimensional grids).
2.  **Pixel Colors**: Each grid primarily consists of white pixels (0) and groups of non-white pixels (red=2 or orange=7 in the examples).
3.  **Objects**: The non-white pixels form contiguous horizontal blocks (objects). These blocks are separated by one or more white pixels.
4.  **Transformation**: The transformation involves identifying these non-white blocks, comparing their lengths (number of contiguous pixels), and selectively keeping only the pixels belonging to the longest block. All other pixels in the output grid become white (0).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Identify the longest contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels in the input row and keep only that block in the output, setting all other pixels to white.
elements:
  - element_type: grid
    properties:
      dimensionality: 1D (single row)
      background_color: white (0)
  - element_type: object
    properties:
      definition: A contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels.
      color: Varies (e.g., red=2, orange=7)
      attribute: length (number of pixels in the sequence)
relationships:
  - type: separation
    description: Non-white blocks are separated by one or more white pixels.
  - type: comparison
    description: The lengths of the non-white blocks are compared.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: contiguous blocks of non-white pixels
  - action: measure
    target: length of each identified block
  - action: find_maximum
    target: block length
    result: the longest block(s)
  - action: filter/select
    description: Keep only the pixels belonging to the uniquely longest block.
  - action: modify
    target: all other pixels (including those in shorter non-white blocks)
    change: set color to white (0)
inferred_rule: The output grid retains only the pixels corresponding to the single longest contiguous block of non-white pixels found in the input grid. All other positions are set to white.
uncertainties:
  - How to handle ties if multiple blocks share the maximum length (not covered by examples). The current interpretation assumes a unique longest block exists or only pixels from *the* single longest block are kept.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input row to identify all contiguous horizontal blocks (sequences) of non-white pixels. Record the start index, end index, and length (number of pixels) for each block.
2.  Determine the maximum length among all identified blocks.
3.  Identify the specific block that has this maximum length. (Assume for now there is only one such block, based on the examples).
4.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled with white pixels (0).
5.  Copy the pixels from the identified longest block (using its start and end indices and original colors) into the corresponding positions in the new output row.
6.  The output row now contains only the longest non-white block from the input, with all other positions being white. Return this output row.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core task: finding the longest contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels within a single row and preserving only that block in the output. The errors encountered during testing ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous") strongly indicated an implementation issue, likely related to how the input data (potentially a NumPy array passed by the test harness) was handled within the Python list-based logic, especially during pixel value comparisons (`pixel != 0`). The strategy is to refine the implementation to robustly handle potential NumPy array inputs while maintaining the core transformation logic. The logic itself appears sound based on the visual examples.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Identify the longest contiguous horizontal sequence (block) of non-white pixels within the input row. Construct an output row of the same dimensions where only the pixels corresponding to this longest block retain their original color and position, and all other pixels are set to white.
problem_type: object_selection # Selects an object based on a property max
grid_dimensionality: 1D # All examples show 1xN grids
input_elements:
  - element: row
    description: A single row of pixels (1xN grid).
    properties:
      width: Variable (32 in examples)
      background_color: white (0)
  - element: block
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of one or more non-white pixels within the row.
    properties:
      color: Any non-white color (red=2, orange=7 in examples)
      length: The number of pixels in the sequence.
      start_index: The 0-based index of the first pixel in the block.
      end_index: The 0-based index of the last pixel in the block.
output_elements:
  - element: row
    description: A single row of pixels with the same dimensions as the input.
    properties:
      content: Contains only the pixels from the single longest block found in the input row, preserved in their original positions. All other pixels are white (0).
relationships:
  - type: separation
    description: Blocks in the input row are separated by one or more white pixels.
  - type: comparison
    description: The lengths of all identified blocks in the input row are compared.
actions:
  - action: find_blocks
    input: input row
    output: list of all non-white contiguous blocks (with start, end, length).
  - action: measure_length
    input: block
    output: length (integer).
  - action: find_maximum_length
    input: list of block lengths
    output: maximum length value.
  - action: select_longest_block
    input: list of blocks, maximum length value
    output: the block matching the maximum length. (If ties, select the first one encountered).
  - action: construct_output
    input: input row dimensions, selected longest block
    output: output row.
    steps:
      - Create a row filled with white (0) pixels, matching input dimensions.
      - If a longest block was selected, copy the pixels from the input row corresponding to the start/end indices of the longest block into the output row.
uncertainties:
  - Tie-breaking: How to handle multiple blocks sharing the same maximum length. The examples do not cover this. The assumed rule (and implementation) is to select the *first* (leftmost) block encountered with the maximum length.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialize:** Create a new output row with the same width as the input row, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
2.  **Scan and Identify:** Iterate through the input row from left to right to identify all contiguous horizontal sequences (blocks) of non-white pixels. For each block found, record its starting index, ending index, and its length (number of pixels).
3.  **Find Maximum Length:** Determine the maximum length among all the blocks identified in step 2. If no non-white blocks were found, skip to step 6.
4.  **Select Longest Block:** Identify the specific block that possesses the maximum length found in step 3. If there are multiple blocks with the same maximum length, select the one that appears first (leftmost) in the input row.
5.  **Copy Block:** Copy the pixels (maintaining their original colors) from the selected longest block (using its recorded start and end indices from the *input* row) into the corresponding positions in the *output* row.
6.  **Finalize:** The output row now contains the pixels of the longest block from the input against a white background. Return this output row.
