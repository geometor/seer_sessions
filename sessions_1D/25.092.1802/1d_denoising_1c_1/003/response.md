Identify the longest contiguous horizontal sequence (block) of non-white pixels within the input row. Construct an output row of the same dimensions where only the pixels corresponding to this longest block retain their original color and position, and all other pixels are set to white (0). If multiple blocks share the maximum length, the first (leftmost) one encountered is selected.
