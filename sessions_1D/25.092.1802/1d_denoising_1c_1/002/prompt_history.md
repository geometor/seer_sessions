**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure**: The input and output are single rows (1-dimensional grids).
2.  **Pixel Colors**: Each grid primarily consists of white pixels (0) and groups of non-white pixels (red=2 or orange=7 in the examples).
3.  **Objects**: The non-white pixels form contiguous horizontal blocks (objects). These blocks are separated by one or more white pixels.
4.  **Transformation**: The transformation involves identifying these non-white blocks, comparing their lengths (number of contiguous pixels), and selectively keeping only the pixels belonging to the longest block. All other pixels in the output grid become white (0).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Identify the longest contiguous horizontal block of non-white pixels in the input row and keep only that block in the output, setting all other pixels to white.
elements:
  - element_type: grid
    properties:
      dimensionality: 1D (single row)
      background_color: white (0)
  - element_type: object
    properties:
      definition: A contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels.
      color: Varies (e.g., red=2, orange=7)
      attribute: length (number of pixels in the sequence)
relationships:
  - type: separation
    description: Non-white blocks are separated by one or more white pixels.
  - type: comparison
    description: The lengths of the non-white blocks are compared.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: contiguous blocks of non-white pixels
  - action: measure
    target: length of each identified block
  - action: find_maximum
    target: block length
    result: the longest block(s)
  - action: filter/select
    description: Keep only the pixels belonging to the uniquely longest block.
  - action: modify
    target: all other pixels (including those in shorter non-white blocks)
    change: set color to white (0)
inferred_rule: The output grid retains only the pixels corresponding to the single longest contiguous block of non-white pixels found in the input grid. All other positions are set to white.
uncertainties:
  - How to handle ties if multiple blocks share the maximum length (not covered by examples). The current interpretation assumes a unique longest block exists or only pixels from *the* single longest block are kept.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input row to identify all contiguous horizontal blocks (sequences) of non-white pixels. Record the start index, end index, and length (number of pixels) for each block.
2.  Determine the maximum length among all identified blocks.
3.  Identify the specific block that has this maximum length. (Assume for now there is only one such block, based on the examples).
4.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled with white pixels (0).
5.  Copy the pixels from the identified longest block (using its start and end indices and original colors) into the corresponding positions in the new output row.
6.  The output row now contains only the longest non-white block from the input, with all other positions being white. Return this output row.
