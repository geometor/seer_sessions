task_type: grid_manipulation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  height: fixed at 2 rows
  width: variable
components:
  - role: static_element
    location: first row (index 0)
    description: This row is transferred unchanged from input to output.
  - role: modified_element
    location: second row (index 1)
    description: This row is replaced entirely in the output.
transformation:
  - action: copy
    source: input grid, first row
    destination: output grid, first row
  - action: replace
    source: input grid, second row
    target_value: white (0)
    destination: output grid, second row
    condition: unconditional for all cells in the second row
relationship:
  - type: positional
    focus: row index
    rule: Row 0 is copied, Row 1 is overwritten.
invariance:
  - property: grid dimensions (height, width) remain the same from input to output.
  - property: content of the first row remains the same.
  - property: specific colors/patterns in the input do not alter the fundamental rule, only the content of the preserved first row.
