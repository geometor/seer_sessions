Across all examples, the first row of the input grid is preserved exactly in the output grid. The second row of the input grid, regardless of its content (colors or patterns), is completely replaced by white pixels (color 0) in the output grid. The transformation rule appears to be independent of the specific colors or patterns within the rows, focusing solely on modifying the second row.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
