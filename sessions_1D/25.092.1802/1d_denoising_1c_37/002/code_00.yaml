task_type: grid_manipulation
input_format_issue: The provided flat string representations of grids have lengths (e.g., 33) inconsistent with a 2-row rectangular structure. Analysis assumes the intended structure is a 2xW grid based on visual interpretation and task context.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  height: fixed at 2 rows (assumed based on visual examples)
  width: variable (derived from total elements / 2)
components:
  - role: static_element
    location: first row (index 0)
    description: This row is transferred unchanged from input to output.
  - role: modified_element
    location: second row (index 1)
    description: This row is replaced entirely in the output.
transformation:
  - action: parse_input
    description: Convert the input representation (potentially a flat list/string) into a 2D grid of Height=2 and Width=(Total Elements / 2). Handle potential errors if input cannot form such a grid.
  - action: copy
    source: parsed input grid, first row
    destination: output grid, first row
  - action: replace
    source: parsed input grid, second row
    target_value: white (0)
    destination: output grid, second row
    condition: unconditional for all cells in the second row
relationship:
  - type: positional
    focus: row index
    rule: Row 0 is copied, Row 1 is overwritten with white (0).
invariance:
  - property: grid dimensions (height=2, width=W) remain the same from input to output.
  - property: content of the first row remains the same.
  - property: specific colors/patterns in the input rows do not alter the fundamental rule (copy row 1, zero row 2), only the content of the preserved first row.
