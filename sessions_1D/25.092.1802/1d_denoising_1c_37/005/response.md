"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
1. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. The second row (index 1) of the output grid is always filled with white pixels (0).
3. A pixel in the first row (index 0) of the output grid is set to white (0) if and only if all the following conditions are met for the corresponding pixel in the input grid:
    a. The pixel itself is non-white (not 0).
    b. The pixel directly below it (in the second row) is white (0).
    c. The pixel's left horizontal neighbor in the first row is white (0). (Treat out-of-bounds as white).
    d. The pixel's right horizontal neighbor in the first row is white (0). (Treat out-of-bounds as white).
4. Otherwise, pixels in the first row retain their original color from the input grid.
