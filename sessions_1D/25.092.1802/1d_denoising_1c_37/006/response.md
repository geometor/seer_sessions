## General Assessment

The previous transformation attempt failed because the generated code, despite describing a potentially correct complex rule in its comments, did not produce the expected output during testing. The test results showed the transformed output was identical to the input, indicating either the modification logic wasn't triggered correctly or the changes weren't persisted/returned properly.

Analysis of the input/output pairs reveals a two-part rule:
1. The second row of the output grid is always entirely white (0).
2. The first row of the output grid is mostly copied from the input, *except* under specific conditions where a non-white pixel is changed to white.

Re-evaluating the condition described in the previous code's comments (`pixel is non-white AND pixel below is white AND left neighbor is white AND right neighbor is white`, all checked against the *input* grid) confirms that this condition accurately predicts the changes observed in the first row of Example 2, and correctly predicts the lack of changes in Examples 1 and 3.

The strategy is to implement this two-part rule accurately, ensuring both row modifications are correctly applied.

    focus: pixels in the second row
    rule: All pixels are unconditionally set to white.
invariance:
  - property: grid dimensions (height, width) remain the same.
  - property: color palette (only colors present in input or white).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid (`output_grid`) with the same dimensions as the `input_grid` and initialize it as a copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Iterate through each column index `c` from 0 to `width - 1` for the first row (row index 0) of the `input_grid`.
3.  For each pixel at `input_grid[0, c]`, check the following conditions based *only* on the `input_grid`:
    a. Is the pixel `input_grid[0, c]` not white (value != 0)?
    b. Is the pixel directly below it, `input_grid[1, c]`, white (value == 0)?
    c. Is the pixel to the left, `input_grid[0, c-1]`, white (value == 0)? (If `c` is 0, treat the left neighbor as white).
    d. Is the pixel to the right, `input_grid[0, c+1]`, white (value == 0)? (If `c` is `width - 1`, treat the right neighbor as white).
4.  If *all four* conditions (a, b, c, d) are true, set the corresponding pixel in the `output_grid` at `output_grid[0, c]` to white (0). (Otherwise, it retains its copied value).
5.  After checking all pixels in the first row, replace the *entire* second row (row index 1) of the `output_grid` with white pixels (0).
6.  Return the modified `output_grid`.
