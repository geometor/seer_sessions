            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous transformation attempt failed because the generated code, despite describing a potentially correct complex rule in its comments, did not produce the expected output during testing. The test results showed the transformed output was identical to the input, indicating either the modification logic wasn't triggered correctly or the changes weren't persisted/returned properly.\n\nAnalysis of the input/output pairs reveals a two-part rule:\n1. The second row of the output grid is always entirely white (0).\n2. The first row of the output grid is mostly copied from the input, *except* under specific conditions where a non-white pixel is changed to white.\n\nRe-evaluating the condition described in the previous code's comments (`pixel is non-white AND pixel below is white AND left neighbor is white AND right neighbor is white`, all checked against the *input* grid) confirms that this condition accurately predicts the changes observed in the first row of Example 2, and correctly predicts the lack of changes in Examples 1 and 3.\n\nThe strategy is to implement this two-part rule accurately, ensuring both row modifications are correctly applied.\n\n## Metrics\n\n"
