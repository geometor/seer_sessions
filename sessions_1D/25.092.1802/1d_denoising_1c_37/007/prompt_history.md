## Perception

The input and output grids in all provided examples consistently have two rows. The width varies between examples. Across all examples, the first row of the input grid is preserved exactly in the output grid. The second row of the input grid, regardless of its content (colors or patterns), is completely replaced by white pixels (color 0) in the output grid. The transformation rule appears to be independent of the specific colors or patterns within the rows, focusing solely on modifying the second row.

## General Assessment

The previous transformation attempt failed because the generated code, despite describing a potentially correct complex rule in its comments, did not produce the expected output during testing. The test results showed the transformed output was identical to the input, indicating either the modification logic wasn't triggered correctly or the changes weren't persisted/returned properly.

Analysis of the input/output pairs reveals a two-part rule:
1. The second row of the output grid is always entirely white (0).
2. The first row of the output grid is mostly copied from the input, *except* under specific conditions where a non-white pixel is changed to white.

Re-evaluating the condition described in the previous code's comments (`pixel is non-white AND pixel below is white AND left neighbor is white AND right neighbor is white`, all checked against the *input* grid) confirms that this condition accurately predicts the changes observed in the first row of Example 2, and correctly predicts the lack of changes in Examples 1 and 3.

The strategy is to implement this two-part rule accurately, ensuring both row modifications are correctly applied.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid (`output_grid`) with the same dimensions as the `input_grid` and initialize it as a copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Iterate through each column index `c` from 0 to `width - 1` for the first row (row index 0) of the `input_grid`.
3.  For each pixel at `input_grid[0, c]`, check the following conditions based *only* on the `input_grid`:
    a. Is the pixel `input_grid[0, c]` not white (value != 0)?
    b. Is the pixel directly below it, `input_grid[1, c]`, white (value == 0)?
    c. Is the pixel to the left, `input_grid[0, c-1]`, white (value == 0)? (If `c` is 0, treat the left neighbor as white).
    d. Is the pixel to the right, `input_grid[0, c+1]`, white (value == 0)? (If `c` is `width - 1`, treat the right neighbor as white).
4.  If *all four* conditions (a, b, c, d) are true, set the corresponding pixel in the `output_grid` at `output_grid[0, c]` to white (0). (Otherwise, it retains its copied value).
5.  After checking all pixels in the first row, replace the *entire* second row (row index 1) of the `output_grid` with white pixels (0).
6.  Return the modified `output_grid`.
