Task: Keep the largest object of each color
Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Objects:
    - Typically two connected components of the same non-background color.
    - One component is significantly larger (in pixel count) than the other(s).
    - The larger component is often a solid rectangle located towards the top.
    - The smaller component(s) are disconnected from the larger one.
Transformation:
  - Identify all connected components for each non-background color present.
  - Calculate the size (pixel count) of each component.
  - Determine the largest component for each color.
  - Retain only the pixels belonging to the largest component(s).
Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as the input.
  - Contains only the background color and the pixels of the largest object(s) identified in the input.
  - Pixels corresponding to smaller objects in the input are replaced with the background color.
Relationships:
  - The core relationship is based on the relative size of connected components of the same color.
  - The transformation preserves the largest component and eliminates smaller ones.
