In each input grid, there are typically two distinct objects (connected components) of the same primary color. One object is significantly larger than the other. The transformation rule appears to involve identifying these objects and retaining only the largest one, while removing the smaller object(s) by replacing their pixels with the background color. The position and shape of the largest object remain unchanged in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Calculate the size (number of pixels) of each identified component.\n    c.  Identify the component with the maximum size. If there's a tie for the largest size, select one arbitrarily (or based on further criteria if needed, though examples suggest a single largest object).\n3.  Initialize the output grid as a grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n4.  For each unique non-background color processed in step 2:\n    a.  Iterate through all pixels belonging to the largest component identified for that color (in step 2c).\n    b.  Set the corresponding pixel coordinates in the output grid to that non-background color.\n5.  The resulting grid is the final output."
