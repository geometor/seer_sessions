**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves processing grids containing a background color (white, 0) and one other primary color. In each input grid, there are typically two distinct objects (connected components) of the same primary color. One object is significantly larger than the other. The transformation rule appears to involve identifying these objects and retaining only the largest one, while removing the smaller object(s) by replacing their pixels with the background color. The position and shape of the largest object remain unchanged in the output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Keep the largest object of each color
Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Objects:
    - Typically two connected components of the same non-background color.
    - One component is significantly larger (in pixel count) than the other(s).
    - The larger component is often a solid rectangle located towards the top.
    - The smaller component(s) are disconnected from the larger one.
Transformation:
  - Identify all connected components for each non-background color present.
  - Calculate the size (pixel count) of each component.
  - Determine the largest component for each color.
  - Retain only the pixels belonging to the largest component(s).
Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as the input.
  - Contains only the background color and the pixels of the largest object(s) identified in the input.
  - Pixels corresponding to smaller objects in the input are replaced with the background color.
Relationships:
  - The core relationship is based on the relative size of connected components of the same color.
  - The transformation preserves the largest component and eliminates smaller ones.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all unique non-background colors present in the input grid.
2.  For each unique non-background color found:
    a.  Find all distinct connected components (objects) composed of pixels of this color. Consider pixels connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically.
    b.  Calculate the size (number of pixels) of each identified component.
    c.  Identify the component with the maximum size. If there's a tie for the largest size, select one arbitrarily (or based on further criteria if needed, though examples suggest a single largest object).
3.  Initialize the output grid as a grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
4.  For each unique non-background color processed in step 2:
    a.  Iterate through all pixels belonging to the largest component identified for that color (in step 2c).
    b.  Set the corresponding pixel coordinates in the output grid to that non-background color.
5.  The resulting grid is the final output.
