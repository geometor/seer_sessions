task_type: filtering
grid_dimensionality: 1D (row represented as a 2D NumPy array with shape (1, N))
input_elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: segment
    description: contiguous sequence of non-white pixels within the row
    properties:
      - color: non-white (e.g., green/3, blue/1)
      - length: number of pixels in the sequence
      - position: start index within the row array
output_elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: segment
    description: the single longest segment from the input row
    properties:
      - color: same as the longest input segment
      - length: same as the longest input segment
      - position: same start index as the longest input segment
transformation:
  action: identify_segments
  description: Find all contiguous segments of non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input row array.
  input: 1D NumPy array representing the input row
  output: list of segments, each described by its color, start index, and length
  action: find_longest_segment
  description: Determine the segment with the maximum length from the identified segments. Based on the examples, there is always a unique longest segment.
  input: list of segments
  output: the single longest segment (dictionary with color, start_index, length)
  action: generate_output_array
  description: Create a new 2D NumPy array with the same shape as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white/0). Copy the pixels corresponding to the identified longest segment from the input array into this new array at the same row and column indices.
  input: input array shape, background color (0), the longest segment's details, the original input row array
  output: final 2D NumPy array representing the output grid
relationship:
  - The output NumPy array has the same shape as the input NumPy array.
  - Only the pixels belonging to the single longest contiguous non-white segment from the input row are preserved in the output.
  - All other pixels in the output array are set to the background color (white/0).
  - If multiple segments have the same maximum length, the provided examples do not cover this case, but the current implementation selects the first one encountered.
  - If no non-white segments exist, the output is an all-white grid of the same shape.
