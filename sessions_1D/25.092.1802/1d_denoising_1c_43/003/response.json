Accept the input as a 2D grid (e.g., NumPy array).\n2.  Identify the single non-white color present in the grid. If only white (0) is present, return an all-white grid of the same dimensions.\n3.  Find all separate groups of connected pixels (objects) of this non-white color using cardinal adjacency (up, down, left, right).\n4.  Count the number of pixels in each object found.\n5.  Identify the object that has the largest count of pixels. If no non-white objects were found, return an all-white grid.\n6.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initially filled entirely with the white color (0).\n7.  For each pixel coordinate that belongs to the largest object identified, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the non-white color.\n8.  Return the resulting 2D output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef _find_objects(grid, target_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous objects of a specific color in a grid using BFS.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The 2D input grid.\n        target_color (int): The color of the objects to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of sets, where each set contains the (row, col) tuples\n              of pixels belonging to a single object.
