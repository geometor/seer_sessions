"""
Identify the single non-white color present in the input grid (assumed to be 4x8).
Find all distinct contiguous objects (groups of connected pixels) of this color using cardinal adjacency (up, down, left, right).
Calculate the size (number of pixels) of each object.
Identify the object with the largest size.
Create a new output grid of the same dimensions (4x8), filled with the background color (white, 0).
Place the pixels belonging to the largest object onto the output grid, preserving their color and position.
Return the flattened 1D representation of the output grid.
