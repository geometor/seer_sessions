Given the length (32) and the nature of ARC tasks, these likely represent flattened 2D grids. Possible dimensions are 2x16, 4x8, 8x4, 16x2. Based on visual grouping in the examples, 4x8 or 8x4 seems most plausible.\n2.  **Color Palette:** Each example uses white (`0`) as the background and one other dominant color (`5` - gray in train_1, `6` - magenta in train_2 & train_3).\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation isolates the largest contiguous group (object) of the dominant non-white color and removes all other pixels (setting them to white).\n4.  **Object Definition:** An \"object\" appears to be a set of connected pixels of the same non-white color. Connectivity seems to be based on cardinal adjacency (sharing an edge, not just a corner).\n5.  **Dominant Color:** In each case, there's only one non-white color present, making it the \"dominant\" color by default.\n6.  **Largest Object:** The key operation is identifying the single largest object based on the number of pixels it contains. All smaller objects and isolated pixels of the same dominant color are removed.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
