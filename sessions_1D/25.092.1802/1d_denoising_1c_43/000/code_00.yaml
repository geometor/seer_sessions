task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D # inferred from 1D array length and typical ARC tasks
  dimensionality_inference: Likely 4x8 or 8x4 based on length 32. Assumed consistent across examples.
  background_color: white (0)
  foreground_colors: Only one non-white color per grid (gray-5 or magenta-6 in examples).

input_elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: object
    description: Contiguous areas of a single non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., gray, magenta).
      - pixels: Set of coordinates belonging to the object.
      - size: Count of pixels in the object.
      - adjacency: Cardinal (up, down, left, right).
    relationships:
      - Multiple distinct objects of the same color can exist in the input.

transformation:
  - action: identify_dominant_color
    description: Find the single non-white color present in the input grid.
  - action: find_objects
    input: dominant_color
    description: Identify all distinct contiguous objects of the dominant color using cardinal adjacency.
  - action: calculate_object_sizes
    input: objects
    description: Determine the number of pixels (size) for each identified object.
  - action: find_largest_object
    input: objects_with_sizes
    description: Select the object with the maximum size. (Assumes no ties for largest based on examples).
  - action: generate_output_grid
    description: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input.
    initial_state: Filled with the background color (white).
  - action: populate_output_grid
    input: largest_object
    description: Place the pixels of the largest object (with their original dominant color) onto the output grid at their corresponding coordinates.

output_elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: object
    description: Only the single largest object from the input grid, preserving its shape, position, and color. All other input elements are replaced by the background color.
