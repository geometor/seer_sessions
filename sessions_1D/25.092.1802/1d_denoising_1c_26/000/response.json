In each example, there appears to be one significantly larger object (a horizontal rectangle) and several much smaller objects (single pixels).\n3.  **Output Grid:** The output grid retains only the largest foreground object from the input grid. All other smaller foreground objects are removed (changed to the white background color). The size, shape, color, and position of the largest object remain unchanged.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is identifying the largest contiguous object of the foreground color and filtering out all other objects of that same color.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
