Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids contain a background of white pixels (0) and foreground pixels of a single non-white color (azure - 8 in examples 1 and 3, blue - 1 in example 2).
2.  **Objects:** The foreground pixels form distinct contiguous objects. In each example, there appears to be one significantly larger object (a horizontal rectangle) and several much smaller objects (single pixels).
3.  **Output Grid:** The output grid retains only the largest foreground object from the input grid. All other smaller foreground objects are removed (changed to the white background color). The size, shape, color, and position of the largest object remain unchanged.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is identifying the largest contiguous object of the foreground color and filtering out all other objects of that same color.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Retain only the largest contiguous object of the primary non-background color.
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - role: primary_elements
    description: Contiguous blocks of pixels of the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., blue, azure). Consistent within a single example pair.
      - size: The number of pixels composing the object (area).
      - shape: Varies (rectangles, single pixels in examples).
      - contiguity: Pixels are considered part of the same object if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically.
  - role: largest_object
    description: The primary element object with the maximum size (area).
    properties:
      - unique: Assumed to be unique in the provided examples. Tie-breaking rules are not explicitly demonstrated.

  - name: identify_objects
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list_of_objects_with_properties (color, size, pixel_locations)

    inputs:

    description: Create a new grid containing only the pixels of the largest object, with all other pixels set to the background color.
relationships:
  - type: size_comparison
    description: Objects are compared based on their size (number of pixels) to determine the largest one.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects formed by non-white pixels in the input grid. For each object, record its color, size (number of pixels), and the coordinates of all its constituent pixels.
3.  If no non-white objects are found, return the initialized (all white) output grid.
4.  Determine the maximum size among all identified objects.
5.  Select the object that has this maximum size. (Assuming a unique largest object based on the examples).
6.  Iterate through the pixel coordinates recorded for the selected largest object. For each coordinate, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the color of the largest object.
7.  Return the final output grid.
