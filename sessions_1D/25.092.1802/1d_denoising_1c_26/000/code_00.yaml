task_description: Retain only the largest contiguous object of the primary non-background color.
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - role: primary_elements
    description: Contiguous blocks of pixels of the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., blue, azure). Consistent within a single example pair.
      - size: The number of pixels composing the object (area).
      - shape: Varies (rectangles, single pixels in examples).
      - contiguity: Pixels are considered part of the same object if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically.
  - role: largest_object
    description: The primary element object with the maximum size (area).
    properties:
      - unique: Assumed to be unique in the provided examples. Tie-breaking rules are not explicitly demonstrated.

    description: Create a new grid containing only the pixels of the largest object, with all other pixels set to the background color.
relationships:
  - type: size_comparison
    description: Objects are compared based on their size (number of pixels) to determine the largest one.
