One of these groups is significantly larger (longer) than the others. The smaller groups appear to be single pixels (isolated).\n4.  **Output Content:** The output grids retain only the largest contiguous group of the non-background color from the input. All other non-background pixels (the smaller, isolated groups) are replaced with the background color (white 0).\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is a filtering process based on the size of contiguous colored regions. The largest region is preserved, while smaller regions are eliminated.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
