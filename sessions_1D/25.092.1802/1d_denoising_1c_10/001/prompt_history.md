*   **Perception:** The input and output are single rows of pixels. The input contains white (0) and blue (1) pixels. There is one long horizontal segment of blue pixels and three isolated single blue pixels, all separated by white pixels. The output retains only the longest horizontal segment of blue pixels, replacing the isolated blue pixels with white pixels. The white pixels remain unchanged unless they replace the isolated blue pixels. The transformation seems to focus on identifying and preserving the largest contiguous block of non-background (non-white) pixels.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: object_selection
    input_dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN grid)
    output_dimensionality: 1D (or 1xN grid)
    background_color: white (0)
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_segment
        color: blue (1)
        properties:
          - location
          - length
    relationships:
      - type: comparison
        property: length
        among: blue segments
    actions:
      - identify: contiguous segments of non-background color (blue)
      - measure: length of each segment
      - select: segment with maximum length
      - create_output: initialize grid with background color (white)
      - copy: pixels of the selected longest segment to the output grid
      - filter_out: all other non-background pixels (shorter blue segments)
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels in the input row.
    2.  Determine the length of each identified segment.
    3.  Find the segment with the greatest length. If there are multiple segments with the same maximum length, this example doesn't specify tie-breaking, but assume any one of them can be chosen.
    4.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input, filled entirely with the white (0) background color.
    5.  Copy the pixels from the single longest segment identified in step 3 from their original positions in the input row to the corresponding positions in the new output row.
    6.  Return the new output row.
