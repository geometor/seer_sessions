There is one long horizontal segment of blue pixels and three isolated single blue pixels, all separated by white pixels. The output retains only the longest horizontal segment of blue pixels, replacing the isolated blue pixels with white pixels. The white pixels remain unchanged unless they replace the isolated blue pixels. The transformation seems to focus on identifying and preserving the largest contiguous block of non-background (non-white) pixels.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
