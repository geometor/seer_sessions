task_type: object_filtering
input_dimensionality: 1D (single row grid)
output_dimensionality: 1D (single row grid)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_horizontal_segment
    definition: A sequence of one or more adjacent pixels in the row with the same non-background color.
    properties:
      - color: (variable, e.g., blue(1), green(3))
      - location: (start_index, end_index)
      - length: number of pixels
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    property: length
    among: all non-background segments in the input row
actions:
  - identify: all contiguous horizontal segments of non-background pixels.
  - measure: the length of each segment.
  - select: the single segment with the maximum length. (Assumption: If ties exist, any one of the longest can be chosen; the examples don't show ties).
  - create_output: initialize a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white/0).
  - copy: the pixels (maintaining color and position) of the selected longest segment from the input to the output grid.
  - filter_out: all other non-background pixels (segments shorter than the maximum length).
