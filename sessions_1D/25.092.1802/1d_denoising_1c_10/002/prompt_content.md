"""
Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels (value > 0) in the input row.
Determine the length of each segment.
Find the segment with the greatest length. If there are multiple segments with the same maximum length, choose the first one encountered.
Create a new output row of the same length as the input, filled entirely with the white (0) background color.
Copy the pixels from the single longest segment identified from their original positions in the input row to the corresponding positions in the new output row.
Return the new output row.
