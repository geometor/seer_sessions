Task: Keep the largest contiguous object of the dominant non-background color.
Elements:
  - Background:
      Color: white (0)
      Role: Fills the grid initially and replaces removed pixels.
  - Foreground Pixels:
      Color: Varies per example (azure - 8 or green - 3)
      Role: Form objects within the grid.
  - Objects:
      Definition: Contiguous areas of the same non-background color.
      Input State: Multiple objects exist - one significantly larger than others, and several small (often single-pixel) objects.
      Output State: Only the single largest object from the input remains.
Properties:
  - Connectivity: Used to define objects (pixels are connected if adjacent horizontally or vertically).
  - Size: Measured by the number of pixels in a contiguous object. Crucial for identifying the object to keep.
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all distinct contiguous objects of the non-background color.
  - Compare: Determine the size (pixel count) of each identified object.
  - Select: Choose the object with the largest size.
  - Filter/Remove: Eliminate all foreground pixels that are not part of the selected largest object.
  - Replace: Change the color of the removed pixels to the background color (white - 0).
Relationships:
  - Largest Object vs Others: The core distinction is based on size. The transformation preserves the largest object while discarding others of the same color.
