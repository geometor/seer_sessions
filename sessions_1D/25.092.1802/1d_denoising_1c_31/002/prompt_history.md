Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs appear to be 1-dimensional arrays or single rows of pixels.
2.  **Colors:** Each example uses only two colors: white (0) and one other color (gray-5, magenta-6, or green-3).
3.  **Objects:** The primary objects are contiguous blocks (sequences) of the non-white color. There are also isolated pixels of the non-white color, which can be considered blocks of size 1.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve selecting specific parts of the non-white pattern and discarding others. The output retains only one contiguous block of the non-white color, while the rest of the grid becomes white.
5.  **Selection Criteria:** By comparing the input and output in each example, the block that is retained in the output is always the *longest* contiguous block of the non-white color present in the input. All other non-white pixels (isolated or part of shorter blocks) are turned into white pixels. The background white pixels remain white or become white if they replace a non-selected non-white pixel.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Keep only the largest contiguous horizontal segment of the non-background color.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row or list)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - color: non-white (variable per example: gray, magenta, green)
      - length: variable
relationships:
  - type: relative_size
    description: Blocks of the non-white color can be compared by their length.
actions:
  - identify_non_white_color: Determine the single color used alongside white.
  - find_contiguous_blocks: Locate all sequences of the non-white color.
  - measure_block_length: Calculate the number of pixels in each block.
  - find_largest_block: Identify the block with the maximum length.
  - create_output_grid: Initialize a grid of the same size as the input with the background color.
  - copy_largest_block: Transfer the pixels of the largest block to the output grid at the same position.
  - set_background: Ensure all other pixels in the output grid are the background color.
result: The output grid contains only the single largest contiguous block of the non-white color from the input, surrounded by the background color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the primary non-white color present in the input row.
2.  Scan the input row to find all contiguous segments (blocks) composed solely of this non-white color.
3.  Calculate the length (number of pixels) of each identified segment.
4.  Determine the maximum length among all found segments.
5.  Identify the segment that has this maximum length. (Assumption based on examples: there will be only one such longest segment).
6.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with the white color (0).
7.  Copy the pixels from the identified longest segment from the input row to the corresponding positions in the new output row.
8.  The resulting output row is the final transformation.
