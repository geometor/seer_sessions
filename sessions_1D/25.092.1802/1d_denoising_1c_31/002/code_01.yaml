task_description: Identify the single longest contiguous horizontal segment of the non-background color within a single row input grid and output only that segment on a background-colored grid of the same size.
grid_representation: Input is effectively a 1D list or a single row of a 2D grid. Output is a 1D list of the same length.
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    properties:
      - color: The single non-white color present in the input row.
      - length: The number of contiguous pixels in the segment.
      - start_index: The starting column index of the segment.
      - end_index: The ending column index of the segment.
relationships:
  - type: size_comparison
    description: Segments of the non-white color are compared based on their length.
actions:
  - identify_input_row: Access the primary data row, potentially from a nested input structure (e.g., list[0] or np_array[0]).
  - identify_non_white_color: Scan the input row to find the single color value that is not 0.
  - find_contiguous_segments: Locate all contiguous sequences (segments) of the non-white color in the input row.
  - measure_segment_length: Calculate the length for each identified segment.
  - find_longest_segment: Determine the segment with the maximum length. If there's a tie, the first one encountered is likely sufficient based on examples.
  - create_output_row: Initialize a list of the same length as the input row, filled with the background color (0).
  - copy_longest_segment: Transfer the pixels (color value) of the longest segment to the corresponding positions (start_index to end_index) in the output row.
result: The output row contains only the single longest contiguous segment of the non-white color from the input row, positioned correctly, with all other pixels being the background color.
