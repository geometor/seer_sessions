The initial `transform` function attempted to iterate through what it thought was a 1D list, but encountered rows (which are lists/arrays themselves), causing the comparison `pixel != 0` to fail.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Re-parse the input and output data as 2D grids.\n2.  Re-evaluate the core logic: The initial hypothesis was finding the longest *horizontal* segment. Given the 2D nature, this needs confirmation. We need to find all contiguous horizontal segments of the non-white color across all rows, identify the absolute longest one, and create an output grid containing only this segment.\n3.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect the 2D structure and the refined logic.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's parse the data correctly and examine the dimensions and contents.\n"
