"""
Identifies the primary non-white color in the input row. Finds all contiguous 
segments (blocks) of this color. Determines the longest segment. Creates an 
output row of the same size, initially all white (0). Copies the pixels of the 
longest segment from the input to the corresponding positions in the output row.

    Finds all contiguous blocks of a specific color in a 1D grid (list).

    Returns:
        list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a block 
              and contains 'start' (index), 'end' (index), and 'length'.
