task_description: Keep only the largest contiguous horizontal segment of the non-background color.
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a single row or list)
background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - color: non-white (variable per example: gray, magenta, green)
      - length: variable
relationships:
  - type: relative_size
    description: Blocks of the non-white color can be compared by their length.
actions:
  - identify_non_white_color: Determine the single color used alongside white.
  - find_contiguous_blocks: Locate all sequences of the non-white color.
  - measure_block_length: Calculate the number of pixels in each block.
  - find_largest_block: Identify the block with the maximum length.
  - create_output_grid: Initialize a grid of the same size as the input with the background color.
  - copy_largest_block: Transfer the pixels of the largest block to the output grid at the same position.
  - set_background: Ensure all other pixels in the output grid are the background color.
result: The output grid contains only the single largest contiguous block of the non-white color from the input, surrounded by the background color.
