There are also isolated pixels of the non-white color, which can be considered blocks of size 1.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve selecting specific parts of the non-white pattern and discarding others. The output retains only one contiguous block of the non-white color, while the rest of the grid becomes white.\n5.  **Selection Criteria:** By comparing the input and output in each example, the block that is retained in the output is always the *longest* contiguous block of the non-white color present in the input. All other non-white pixels (isolated or part of shorter blocks) are turned into white pixels. The background white pixels remain white or become white if they replace a non-selected non-white pixel.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Determine the maximum length among all found segments.\n5.  Identify the segment that has this maximum length. (Assumption based on examples: there will be only one such longest segment).\n6.  Create a new output row of the same length as the input row, initially filled entirely with the white color (0).\n7.
