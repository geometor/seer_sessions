In each example, there is one dominant, larger object (a contiguous horizontal line) and several smaller objects (single pixels or very short lines) of the same color, separated by the background color. The output grid retains only the largest contiguous object from the input, setting all other pixels, including those of the smaller objects, to the background color ('white'). The color of the largest object is preserved in the output.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
