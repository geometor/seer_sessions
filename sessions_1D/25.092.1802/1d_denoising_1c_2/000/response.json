Each example involves a background color (white, 0) and one other primary color (red, azure, or orange). The primary color appears as one main contiguous block and potentially several other scattered pixels or smaller blocks. The core transformation seems to involve isolating the largest contiguous block of the primary color found in the input and discarding all other instances of that color, replacing them with the background color. The position and color of the largest block are preserved in the output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
