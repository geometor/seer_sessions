Data:
  - type: 1D array (or flattened grid)
    colors:
      - background: 0 (white)
      - foreground: one primary color C (varies per example: 2, 8, 7)

Objects:
  - type: contiguous blocks of the foreground color C
  - properties:
      - color: C
      - length: number of consecutive pixels
      - position: start and end indices

Relationships:
  - The input contains multiple blocks/pixels of color C.
  - One of these blocks is the longest.

Actions:
  - Identify the foreground color C.
  - Find all contiguous blocks of color C.
  - Identify the block with the maximum length.
  - Create an output array initialized with the background color (0).
  - Copy the pixels of the identified longest block from the input to the corresponding positions in the output array.

Result:
  - The output array contains only the single largest contiguous block of color C, preserved in its original position, surrounded by the background color.
