"""
Identify the single non-zero foreground color in the input list (assumed to be 1D or flattened).
Find all contiguous blocks (sequences) of this foreground color.
Determine the single longest contiguous block among them. If there's a tie, the first one encountered is chosen.
Create an output list of the same size as the input, initially filled with the background color (0).
Copy only the pixels corresponding to the identified longest block from their original positions in the input list to the corresponding positions in the output list.
Return the resulting list. All other pixels in the output list remain the background color.
