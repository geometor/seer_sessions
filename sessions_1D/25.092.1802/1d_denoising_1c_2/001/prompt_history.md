**Perception**

The input and output are presented as flattened lists of integers (pixels), likely representing single rows or flattened grids. Each example involves a background color (white, 0) and one other primary color (red, azure, or orange). The primary color appears as one main contiguous block and potentially several other scattered pixels or smaller blocks. The core transformation seems to involve isolating the largest contiguous block of the primary color found in the input and discarding all other instances of that color, replacing them with the background color. The position and color of the largest block are preserved in the output.

**Facts**


```yaml
Data:
  - type: 1D array (or flattened grid)
    colors:
      - background: 0 (white)
      - foreground: one primary color C (varies per example: 2, 8, 7)

Objects:
  - type: contiguous blocks of the foreground color C
  - properties:
      - color: C
      - length: number of consecutive pixels
      - position: start and end indices

Relationships:
  - The input contains multiple blocks/pixels of color C.
  - One of these blocks is the longest.

Actions:
  - Identify the foreground color C.
  - Find all contiguous blocks of color C.
  - Identify the block with the maximum length.
  - Create an output array initialized with the background color (0).
  - Copy the pixels of the identified longest block from the input to the corresponding positions in the output array.

Result:
  - The output array contains only the single largest contiguous block of color C, preserved in its original position, surrounded by the background color.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the foreground color (the single non-zero color present in the input array).
2.  Scan the input array to find all contiguous sequences (blocks) of this foreground color.
3.  Identify the single longest contiguous block among those found.
4.  Create a new output array of the same size as the input, initially filled with the background color (0).
5.  Copy the identified longest block of the foreground color from its original position in the input array to the corresponding position in the output array.
6.  Return the modified output array.
