The input grids feature one large, contiguous object composed of the primary color, along with one or more smaller, isolated pixels (or potentially small groups) of the same primary color located elsewhere in the grid. The transformation appears to isolate the largest contiguous object of the primary color. All other pixels of the primary color that are not part of this largest object are removed (changed to the background color). The background pixels and the pixels forming the largest object remain unchanged in their positions.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
