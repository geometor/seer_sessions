task_context:
  grid_size: Fixed (4x8 in examples)
  background_color: 0 (white)
  input_features:
    - Multiple objects of a single primary color (non-zero).
    - One object is significantly larger (in terms of pixel count) than others.
    - Smaller objects appear as isolated pixels or small groups.
  output_features:
    - Contains only the largest contiguous object from the input.
    - All other pixels of the primary color are replaced with the background color.
transformation_type: Object filtering based on size.

object_definitions:
  - object: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-background color. Adjacency is defined by sharing an edge (not just diagonally).
  - background: Pixels with color 0 (white).
  - primary_color: The single non-background color present in each input grid (e.g., 2, 8, 3).
  - largest_object: The object (as defined above) with the greatest number of pixels.

actions:
  - Identify all objects of the primary color.
  - Calculate the size (pixel count) of each object.
  - Find the object with the maximum size.
  - Filter the grid to keep only the pixels belonging to the largest object.
  - Replace all other pixels of the primary color with the background color.

relationships:
  - Pixels belong to objects.
  - Objects have a size property.
  - The transformation selects based on the 'largest' size relationship among objects of the same color.
