"""
Identify all contiguous objects for each non-background color in the input grid.
For each color, determine the object(s) with the largest size (most pixels).
Create an output grid containing only the background pixels and the pixels 
belonging to the largest object(s) of each color. All other pixels are set 
to the background color (0). Contiguity is defined by cardinal directions 
(up, down, left, right).
