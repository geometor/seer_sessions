            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The examples seem to represent transformations on grids. The raw data is presented as 1D arrays, but the lengths are inconsistent (`train_1` and `train_2` have length 33, `train_3` has length 32). This inconsistency is unusual for ARC tasks and might indicate a copy-paste error in the prompt. Assuming standard ARC behavior, the inputs should likely resolve to consistent 2D grid structures. Testing different dimensions (e.g., 3x11 for `train_1`/`train_2` and 4x8 for `train_3`) reveals a plausible interpretation.\n2.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0) as the background color and one other primary color per example (magenta '6' in `train_1`, green '3' in `train_2`, orange '7' in `train_3`).\n3.  **Objects:** In each input grid, there appears to be one large contiguous object of the primary color and one or more smaller objects (often single pixels) of the *same* primary color, separated from the main object by the background color.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation consistently removes the smaller, separated objects of the primary color, changing their pixels to the background color (white). The largest contiguous object of the primary color remains unchanged, as do the original background pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
