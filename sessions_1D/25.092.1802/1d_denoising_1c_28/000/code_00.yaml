task_description: Keep only the largest contiguous object for each non-background color.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - foreground_colors: [magenta (6), green (3), orange (7)] # Varies per example
  - type: object
    description: Contiguous block of pixels of the same non-background color.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels forming the object.
      - size: The number of pixels in the object.
      - location: Coordinates of the pixels.
      - connectivity: Pixels are connected cardinally (up, down, left, right).
  - type: concept
    description: Largest object
    details: For a given color, the object with the maximum number of pixels compared to other objects of the same color.

actions:
  - name: identify_objects
    description: Find all contiguous blocks of pixels for each non-background color.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list_of_objects_per_color
  - name: find_largest_object
    description: For each color, determine which object has the maximum size.
    inputs: list_of_objects_per_color
    outputs: largest_object_per_color
  - name: filter_pixels
    description: Change pixels belonging to non-largest objects to the background color.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - largest_object_per_color
      - list_of_objects_per_color
    outputs: output_grid
    logic: |
      Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid.
      For each pixel (r, c) in the input_grid:
        If the pixel color is non-background:
          Identify the object the pixel belongs to.
          If this object is NOT the largest object of its color:
            Set output_grid[r, c] to background_color (0).

relationships:
  - type: comparison
    description: Objects of the same color are compared based on size (pixel count).
  - type: preservation
    description: Pixels belonging to the largest object of each color are preserved. Background pixels are preserved.
  - type: removal
    description: Pixels belonging to objects that are not the largest of their color are removed (changed to background).

assumptions:
  - Grid dimensions might be inconsistent across examples as presented, but a consistent underlying logic applies. (e.g., 3x11 for train_1/2, 4x8 for train_3 based on index changes).
  - For each color present, there is a unique largest object.
  - Connectivity is defined by cardinal adjacency (up, down, left, right).
  - White (0) is always the background color.
