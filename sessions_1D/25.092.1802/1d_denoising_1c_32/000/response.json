Each input contains white pixels (0) and pixels of a single other color (red=2, yellow=4, or gray=5). The non-white pixels form one or more contiguous horizontal segments separated by white pixels. The output grid retains only the longest of these non-white segments, preserving its color and position. All other pixels in the output grid are white.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
