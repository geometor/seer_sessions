task_type: object_selection
description: Identify and isolate the longest contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels.
elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., red, yellow, gray). Varies per example but is consistent within an example.
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - position: The starting and ending column index of the segment.
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    description: Segments are compared based on their length.
action:
  - type: find_segments
    description: Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of the non-white color in the input grid.
  - type: find_longest
    description: Determine the segment with the maximum length. (Assumes a unique longest segment based on examples).
  - type: filter
    description: Keep only the longest segment identified.
  - type: construct_output
    description: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white). Place the longest segment into this new grid at its original position.
input_output_mapping:
  - input_segments: Multiple segments of varying lengths.
  - output_segments: Only the single longest segment from the input.
