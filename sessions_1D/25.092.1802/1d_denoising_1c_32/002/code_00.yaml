task_type: object_filtering
grid_dimensionality: 1D # Based on provided examples
description: Isolate the longest contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels within a 1D grid.
elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Fills the grid initially and replaces filtered-out segments.
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of pixels of the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., red, yellow, gray). Only one non-white color per grid.
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - position: The start and end column index of the segment.
relationships:
  - type: contiguity
    description: Pixels of the same non-white color must be adjacent horizontally to form a segment.
  - type: comparison
    description: Segments are compared based on their length property.
action:
  - type: identification
    description: Identify the single non-white color present in the input grid.
  - type: segmentation
    description: Scan the input grid horizontally to find all contiguous segments composed of the identified non-white color. Record their start index, end index, and length.
  - type: selection
    description: Select the segment with the maximum length. If multiple segments share the maximum length, the examples do not specify tie-breaking, but the implementation implicitly selects the first one encountered during the `max` operation.
  - type: construction
    description: Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white).
  - type: placement
    description: Copy the pixels of the selected longest segment from their original positions in the input grid to the corresponding positions in the new output grid.
input_output_mapping:
  - input: 1D grid containing white pixels and potentially multiple segments of a single non-white color.
  - output: 1D grid of the same size, containing only the single longest segment from the input, preserving its color and position, with all other pixels being white. If the input contains only white pixels or no segments, the output is entirely white.
