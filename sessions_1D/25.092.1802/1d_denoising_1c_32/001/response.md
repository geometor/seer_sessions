Identify the non-white color present in the input grid (represented as a 1D list).
Scan the input grid horizontally to find all contiguous segments composed solely of this non-white color.
Determine the segment with the maximum length.
Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white).
Place the longest segment into this new grid at its original position.
Return the new output grid.
