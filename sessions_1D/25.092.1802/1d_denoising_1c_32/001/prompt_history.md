**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays represented visually). Each input contains white pixels (0) and pixels of a single other color (red=2, yellow=4, or gray=5). The non-white pixels form one or more contiguous horizontal segments separated by white pixels. The output grid retains only the longest of these non-white segments, preserving its color and position. All other pixels in the output grid are white.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_selection
description: Identify and isolate the longest contiguous horizontal segment of non-white pixels.
elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: segment
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., red, yellow, gray). Varies per example but is consistent within an example.
      - length: The number of pixels in the segment.
      - position: The starting and ending column index of the segment.
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    description: Segments are compared based on their length.
action:
  - type: find_segments
    description: Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of the non-white color in the input grid.
  - type: find_longest
    description: Determine the segment with the maximum length. (Assumes a unique longest segment based on examples).
  - type: filter
    description: Keep only the longest segment identified.
  - type: construct_output
    description: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white). Place the longest segment into this new grid at its original position.
input_output_mapping:
  - input_segments: Multiple segments of varying lengths.
  - output_segments: Only the single longest segment from the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the non-white color present in the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid horizontally to find all contiguous segments composed solely of this non-white color. Record the start index, end index, and length of each segment found.
3.  Compare the lengths of all identified segments to find the maximum length.
4.  Identify the segment that corresponds to this maximum length.
5.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with the white (0) color.
6.  Copy the pixels belonging to the identified longest segment from their original positions in the input grid to the corresponding positions in the new output grid.
7.  Return the new output grid.
