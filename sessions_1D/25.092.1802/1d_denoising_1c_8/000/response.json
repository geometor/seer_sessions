These non-white segments vary in length. The output retains only the longest contiguous segment of the non-white color from the input, placed in the same position. All other pixels in the output grid, including those that were part of shorter non-white segments in the input, are white (0). The core transformation involves identifying contiguous blocks of non-white pixels, comparing their lengths, and preserving only the longest block while discarding the others.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
