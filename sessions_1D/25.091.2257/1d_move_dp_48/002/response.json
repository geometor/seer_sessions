            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code attempt failed across all training examples with the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'`. This indicates that while the function signature specified `List[List[int]]`, the actual data passed during execution was a NumPy array. The core logic of identifying the colored block, the maroon marker, and the white gap between them, then moving the gap to the front, appears conceptually correct based on visual inspection of the examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Acknowledge Data Type:** Recognize that the input grid is a NumPy array, specifically a 2D array with one row (shape `(1, N)`). The row itself (`input_grid[0]`) is a 1D NumPy array.\n2.  **Adapt Implementation:** Modify the helper functions (`find_colored_block`, `find_marker`) and the main `transform` function to work directly with NumPy arrays using appropriate methods (like `np.where`, array slicing, concatenation) or convert the input row to a Python list using `.tolist()` before applying the existing list-based logic. The latter might be simpler given the current code structure.\n3.  **Verify Logic:** Ensure the segmentation logic (identifying leading pixels, colored block, gap, marker, trailing pixels) correctly handles edge cases, such as when the colored block starts at index 0 or the marker is at the end. The analysis performed during thought confirms the logic holds for all examples.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe `tool_code` execution confirmed the following:\n\n*   **Input Type:** `numpy.ndarray` for all examples.\n*   **Input Shape:** `(1, 27)` for all training examples, indicating a single row of 27 pixels.\n*   **Row Type:** `numpy.ndarray` (1D).\n*   **Element Type:** `int64`.\n*   **Error Cause:** The code used `row.index(9)`, a list method, on a NumPy array.\n*   **NumPy Alternative:** `np.where(row == 9)[0][0]` successfully finds the index of the marker.\n*   **List Conversion Alternative:** `row.tolist().index(9)` also successfully finds the index.\n\nAll training examples conform to the pattern:\n*   Exactly one row.\n*   A single contiguous block of a color other than white (0) or maroon (9).\n*   Exactly one maroon (9) pixel.\n*   The maroon pixel is always to the right of the colored block.\n*   There is a gap of one or more white (0) pixels between the colored block and the maroon pixel.\n\n## YAML Documenting Facts\n\n"
