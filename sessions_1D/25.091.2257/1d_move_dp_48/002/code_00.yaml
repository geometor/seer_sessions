task_type: rearrangement
grid_dimensionality: 1D (represented as a 1xN NumPy array)
input_source_type: numpy.ndarray # Explicitly state the input type
objects:
  - type: colored_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical pixels, where the color is not white (0) and not maroon (9). Exactly one per input row.
    properties:
      - color: variable (yellow, gray, orange in examples)
      - length: variable
      - location: defined by start and end indices
  - type: marker
    description: A single maroon (9) pixel. Exactly one per input row.
    properties:
      - color: maroon (9)
      - location: defined by a single index
  - type: gap
    description: A sequence of one or more white (0) pixels located directly between the rightmost pixel of the colored_block and the marker pixel.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - length: variable (>= 1)
      - location: defined by start and end indices (immediately following colored_block, immediately preceding marker)
  - type: leading_whites
    description: Optional sequence of white (0) pixels before the colored_block.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
  - type: trailing_whites
    description: Optional sequence of white (0) pixels after the marker.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
relationships:
  - type: spatial_input_order
    description: The pixels in the input row are ordered as: [leading_whites, colored_block, gap, marker, trailing_whites]. Some segments (leading/trailing whites) might be empty.
actions:
  - action: extract_segments
    description: Identify and isolate the pixel sequences corresponding to leading_whites, colored_block, gap, marker, and trailing_whites based on their definitions and spatial relationships.
  - action: move_gap
    description: Relocate the extracted 'gap' sequence to the beginning of the row.
output_state:
  - description: The pixels are rearranged in the order: [gap, leading_whites, colored_block, marker, trailing_whites].
  - description: The colored_block becomes immediately adjacent (to the left) of the marker pixel in the output.
  - description: The total number of pixels and the counts of each color remain unchanged.
