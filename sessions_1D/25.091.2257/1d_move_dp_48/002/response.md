## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code attempt failed across all training examples with the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'`. This indicates that while the function signature specified `List[List[int]]`, the actual data passed during execution was a NumPy array. The core logic of identifying the colored block, the maroon marker, and the white gap between them, then moving the gap to the front, appears conceptually correct based on visual inspection of the examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Acknowledge Data Type:** Recognize that the input grid is a NumPy array, specifically a 2D array with one row (shape `(1, N)`). The row itself (`input_grid[0]`) is a 1D NumPy array.
2.  **Adapt Implementation:** Modify the helper functions (`find_colored_block`, `find_marker`) and the main `transform` function to work directly with NumPy arrays using appropriate methods (like `np.where`, array slicing, concatenation) or convert the input row to a Python list using `.tolist()` before applying the existing list-based logic. The latter might be simpler given the current code structure.
3.  **Verify Logic:** Ensure the segmentation logic (identifying leading pixels, colored block, gap, marker, trailing pixels) correctly handles edge cases, such as when the colored block starts at index 0 or the marker is at the end. The analysis performed during thought confirms the logic holds for all examples.

## Metrics

The `tool_code` execution confirmed the following:

*   **Input Type:** `numpy.ndarray` for all examples.
*   **Input Shape:** `(1, 27)` for all training examples, indicating a single row of 27 pixels.
*   **Row Type:** `numpy.ndarray` (1D).
*   **Element Type:** `int64`.
*   **Error Cause:** The code used `row.index(9)`, a list method, on a NumPy array.
*   **NumPy Alternative:** `np.where(row == 9)[0][0]` successfully finds the index of the marker.
*   **List Conversion Alternative:** `row.tolist().index(9)` also successfully finds the index.

All training examples conform to the pattern:
*   Exactly one row.
*   A single contiguous block of a color other than white (0) or maroon (9).
*   Exactly one maroon (9) pixel.
*   The maroon pixel is always to the right of the colored block.
*   There is a gap of one or more white (0) pixels between the colored block and the maroon pixel.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid, which is a NumPy array containing a single row. Extract this row.
2.  Convert the row from a NumPy array to a Python list to facilitate processing with list methods (or adapt subsequent steps to use NumPy operations).
3.  **Identify the Colored Block:** Scan the list to find the start and end indices of the first contiguous sequence of pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor maroon (9). Record the pixels in this block.
4.  **Identify the Marker:** Find the index of the single maroon (9) pixel. Record this pixel.
5.  **Identify the Gap:** Identify the sequence of white (0) pixels located strictly between the end index of the colored block and the index of the marker. Record the pixels in this gap.
6.  **Identify Leading Whites:** Identify the sequence of pixels (expected to be white) from the start of the list up to the start index of the colored block. Record these pixels.
7.  **Identify Trailing Whites:** Identify the sequence of pixels (expected to be white) from the index immediately after the marker to the end of the list. Record these pixels.
8.  **Reconstruct the Output Row:** Assemble a new list by concatenating the recorded segments in the following order: gap, leading whites, colored block, marker, trailing whites.
9.  Convert the reconstructed list back into a single-row NumPy array to match the expected output format.
