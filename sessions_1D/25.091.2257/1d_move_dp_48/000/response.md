*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   The inputs and outputs are single-row grids (1D arrays).
    *   Each input grid contains exactly one contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels (e.g., yellow, gray, orange). Let's call this the "colored block".
    *   Each input grid contains exactly one maroon (9) pixel, always located to the right of the colored block.
    *   There are one or more white (0) pixels located between the right end of the colored block and the maroon pixel.
    *   The transformation involves rearranging the pixels in the row.

*   **YAML documenting facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: rearrangement
    grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
    objects:
      - type: colored_block
        description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-white, non-maroon pixels. Exactly one per input.
        properties:
          - color: variable (yellow, gray, orange in examples)
          - length: variable
      - type: marker
        description: A single maroon (9) pixel. Exactly one per input.
        properties:
          - color: maroon (9)
      - type: gap
        description: A sequence of one or more white (0) pixels located directly between the colored_block and the marker.
        properties:
          - color: white (0)
          - length: variable
    relationships:
      - type: spatial
        description: In the input, the order is (optional leading whites), colored_block, gap, marker, (optional trailing whites).
    actions:
      - action: move_gap
        description: The white pixels constituting the 'gap' are moved from their position between the colored_block and the marker to the beginning (leftmost positions) of the grid.
    output_state:
      - description: The colored_block becomes immediately adjacent to the left of the marker pixel.
      - description: The pixels originally forming the 'gap' are now at the start of the grid.
      - description: All other pixels maintain their relative order.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the single contiguous block of non-white, non-maroon pixels (the "colored block").
    2.  Identify the single maroon (9) pixel (the "marker").
    3.  Identify the sequence of white (0) pixels located immediately between the rightmost pixel of the colored block and the marker pixel (the "gap").
    4.  Remove the gap pixels from their original position.
    5.  Insert the removed gap pixels at the beginning (left end) of the grid.
    6.  The resulting arrangement forms the output grid.
