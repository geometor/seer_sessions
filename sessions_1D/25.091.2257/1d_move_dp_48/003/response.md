Identify the single contiguous block of non-white (0), non-maroon (9) pixels 
(the "colored block"), the single maroon (9) pixel (the "marker"), and the 
sequence of white (0) pixels located immediately between the colored block and 
the marker (the "gap"). Move the gap pixels from their original position to the

adjacent to the left of the marker pixel. All other pixels maintain their 
relative order. The input is a NumPy array with a single row, and the output
