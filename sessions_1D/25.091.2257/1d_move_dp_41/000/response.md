Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Grid Structure**: The inputs and outputs are all 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN grids).
2.  **Color Palette**: The primary colors involved are white (0) and blue (1). Other colors like red (2) and orange (7) form contiguous blocks.
3.  **Key Components**: Each input grid seems to contain:
    *   An optional block of leading white pixels (0).
    *   A contiguous block of non-white, non-blue pixels (e.g., red `222` or orange `777777`). Let's call this the "main colored block".
    *   An optional block of intermediate white pixels (0) following the main colored block.
    *   A single blue pixel (1).
    *   An optional block of trailing white pixels (0).
4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation appears to be a rearrangement of these components. Specifically, the intermediate white pixels (those originally between the main colored block and the blue pixel) are moved to the beginning of the grid, placed *after* the leading white pixels but *before* the main colored block. The relative order of the main colored block, the blue pixel, and the trailing white pixels remains the same. The main colored block and the blue pixel become adjacent in the output.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1D grid based on color patterns.
components:
  - object: leading_whites
    description: Sequence of zero or more white (0) pixels at the beginning of the grid, up to the first non-white pixel.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - position: Start of the grid.
  - object: main_colored_block
    description: Contiguous sequence of non-white (0), non-blue (1) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Any color except 0 or 1.
      - position: Follows leading_whites.
  - object: intermediate_whites
    description: Sequence of zero or more white (0) pixels located between the main_colored_block and the blue_pixel.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - position: Between main_colored_block and blue_pixel.
  - object: blue_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color blue (1).
    properties:
      - color: 1 (blue)
      - position: Follows intermediate_whites.
  - object: trailing_whites
    description: Sequence of zero or more white (0) pixels after the blue_pixel.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - position: End of the grid, after blue_pixel.
actions:
  - action: relocate_intermediate_whites
    description: Move the intermediate_whites segment.
    source_location: Between main_colored_block and blue_pixel.
    destination_location: Immediately after leading_whites and before main_colored_block.
relationships:
  - relationship: adjacency_change
    description: In the output, the main_colored_block becomes immediately adjacent to the blue_pixel.
    elements: [main_colored_block, blue_pixel]
  - relationship: order_preservation
    description: The relative order of leading_whites, main_colored_block, blue_pixel, and trailing_whites is maintained, excluding the relocated intermediate_whites.
    elements: [leading_whites, main_colored_block, blue_pixel, trailing_whites]
output_construction:
  - step: Concatenate leading_whites.
  - step: Concatenate relocated intermediate_whites.
  - step: Concatenate main_colored_block.
  - step: Concatenate blue_pixel.
  - step: Concatenate trailing_whites.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Parse the input 1D grid into five distinct segments based on color and position:
    *   **Leading Whites**: Identify the sequence of white (0) pixels from the start of the grid up to the first non-white pixel.
    *   **Main Colored Block**: Identify the contiguous sequence of non-white (0), non-blue (1) pixels that follows the leading whites.
    *   **Intermediate Whites**: Identify the sequence of white (0) pixels located between the end of the Main Colored Block and the Blue Pixel.
    *   **Blue Pixel**: Locate the single blue (1) pixel.
    *   **Trailing Whites**: Identify the sequence of white (0) pixels following the Blue Pixel to the end of the grid.
2.  Construct the output 1D grid by concatenating these segments in the following new order:
    *   Leading Whites
    *   Intermediate Whites
    *   Main Colored Block
    *   Blue Pixel
    *   Trailing Whites
