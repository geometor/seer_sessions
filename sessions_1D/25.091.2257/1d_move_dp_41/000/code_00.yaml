task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1D grid based on color patterns.
components:
  - object: leading_whites
    description: Sequence of zero or more white (0) pixels at the beginning of the grid, up to the first non-white pixel.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - position: Start of the grid.
  - object: main_colored_block
    description: Contiguous sequence of non-white (0), non-blue (1) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Any color except 0 or 1.
      - position: Follows leading_whites.
  - object: intermediate_whites
    description: Sequence of zero or more white (0) pixels located between the main_colored_block and the blue_pixel.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - position: Between main_colored_block and blue_pixel.
  - object: blue_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color blue (1).
    properties:
      - color: 1 (blue)
      - position: Follows intermediate_whites.
  - object: trailing_whites
    description: Sequence of zero or more white (0) pixels after the blue_pixel.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - position: End of the grid, after blue_pixel.
actions:
  - action: relocate_intermediate_whites
    description: Move the intermediate_whites segment.
    source_location: Between main_colored_block and blue_pixel.
    destination_location: Immediately after leading_whites and before main_colored_block.
relationships:
  - relationship: adjacency_change
    description: In the output, the main_colored_block becomes immediately adjacent to the blue_pixel.
    elements: [main_colored_block, blue_pixel]
  - relationship: order_preservation
    description: The relative order of leading_whites, main_colored_block, blue_pixel, and trailing_whites is maintained, excluding the relocated intermediate_whites.
    elements: [leading_whites, main_colored_block, blue_pixel, trailing_whites]
output_construction:
  - step: Concatenate leading_whites.
  - step: Concatenate relocated intermediate_whites.
  - step: Concatenate main_colored_block.
  - step: Concatenate blue_pixel.
  - step: Concatenate trailing_whites.
