            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The inputs and outputs are all 1-dimensional grids (or 1xN grids).\n2.  **Color Palette**: The primary colors involved are white (0) and blue (1). Other colors like red (2) and orange (7) form contiguous blocks.\n3.  **Key Components**: Each input grid seems to contain:\n    *   An optional block of leading white pixels (0).\n    *   A contiguous block of non-white, non-blue pixels (e.g., red `222` or orange `777777`). Let's call this the \"main colored block\".\n    *   An optional block of intermediate white pixels (0) following the main colored block.\n    *   A single blue pixel (1).\n    *   An optional block of trailing white pixels (0).\n4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation appears to be a rearrangement of these components. Specifically, the intermediate white pixels (those originally between the main colored block and the blue pixel) are moved to the beginning of the grid, placed *after* the leading white pixels but *before* the main colored block. The relative order of the main colored block, the blue pixel, and the trailing white pixels remains the same. The main colored block and the blue pixel become adjacent in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
