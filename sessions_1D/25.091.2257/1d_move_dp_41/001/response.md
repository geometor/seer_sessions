"""
Identify segments in the 1D input grid based on color patterns: leading white (0) pixels, a main colored block (not 0 or 1), intermediate white (0) pixels, a single blue (1) pixel, and trailing white (0) pixels. Rearrange these segments to form the output grid by moving the intermediate white pixels to the position immediately after the leading white pixels and before the main colored block. The final order of segments is: leading whites, intermediate whites, main colored block, blue pixel, trailing whites.
