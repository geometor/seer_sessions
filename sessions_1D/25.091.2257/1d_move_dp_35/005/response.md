"""
Transforms a 1xN input grid by:
1. Identifying a single 'anchor' pixel (magenta, color 6) which remains stationary.
2. Identifying a contiguous horizontal block of a single color (neither white 0 nor magenta 6) within the single row.
3. Shifting this block horizontally to the right within the row so that its rightmost pixel is positioned immediately to the left of the anchor pixel.
4. Filling the original location of the shifted block with the background color (white, 0).
The output grid has the same dimensions (1xN) as the input grid.
