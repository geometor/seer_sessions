task_type: object_manipulation
grid_dimensionality: 1D (single row)
component_identification:
  - object: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      role: static_area
  - object: target_pixel
    properties:
      color: magenta (6)
      shape: single_pixel
      count: 1
      role: anchor_point
  - object: movable_block
    properties:
      color: non-white, non-magenta (variable: yellow, azure, blue in examples)
      shape: contiguous_horizontal_block
      count: 1
      role: object_to_be_moved
transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift
  direction: right
  affected_object: movable_block
  shift_rule: Move the movable_block rightwards until its rightmost pixel is located at the column index immediately preceding the column index of the target_pixel.
  post_action:
    - Fill the original location of the movable_block with background (white) pixels.
relationships:
  - type: spatial_adjacency
    object1: movable_block (rightmost pixel)
    object2: target_pixel
    condition_in_output: object1 is immediately to the left of object2.
invariants:
  - grid_dimensions
  - position_of_target_pixel
  - position_of_background_pixels (excluding those replaced by the moved block or those filling the block's original space)
  - color_of_target_pixel
  - color_of_movable_block
