Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

The input and output are single-row grids (1D arrays) of pixels.
Each input grid contains:
1.  A background of white pixels (color 0).
2.  A single magenta pixel (color 6).
3.  A contiguous horizontal block of pixels of *another* color (yellow, azure, or blue in the examples).

The transformation involves moving the contiguous block horizontally.
Specifically, the block shifts to the right.
The final position of the block is such that its rightmost pixel is immediately adjacent to the left side of the single magenta pixel.
The space originally occupied by the block becomes white (background color).
The magenta pixel and all other white pixels (that were not part of the moved block's original location) remain in their original positions.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the grid dimensions (which remain constant).
2.  Locate the position (column index) of the single magenta pixel (color 6). This is the target position's right boundary.
3.  Identify the contiguous horizontal block of non-white, non-magenta pixels. Note its color, starting column index, and ending column index (length).
4.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
5.  Place the magenta pixel (color 6) in the new grid at its original column index.
6.  Determine the new starting column index for the identified block. This will be `(magenta_pixel_index - block_length)`.
7.  Place the block (using its original color and length) into the new grid starting at this new calculated index and ending at the index immediately before the magenta pixel (`magenta_pixel_index - 1`).
8.  Fill any remaining positions in the new grid with the background color (white, 0), ensuring positions already filled by the block or the magenta pixel are not overwritten. (Step 4 handles most of this, this is just a clarification).
9.  The resulting grid is the output.
