            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core components (background, anchor pixel, movable block) and the transformation rule (shift block right to be adjacent to the anchor). The Python code implemented this logic. However, the code failed on all examples with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`. This specific error strongly suggests that the code attempted to use a multi-element NumPy array in a boolean context (e.g., an `if` statement) where a single `True` or `False` value was expected.\n\nThe most likely cause, given the ARC environment often uses 2D arrays even for single rows/columns, is that the input `input_grid` was passed as a 2D NumPy array (e.g., shape `(1, N)`) instead of the assumed 1D list. The provided code did not explicitly handle this 2D structure, leading to errors when iterating or comparing parts of the array.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the input data structure (likely 2D NumPy array).\n2.  Modify the helper functions and main logic to operate explicitly on the relevant row (the first row, index 0) of the 2D grid.\n3.  Retain the core transformation logic: find anchor, find block, calculate new position, create output grid.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's verify the input structure and key properties using the first training example.\n\n"

Create a new output grid of the same dimensions (1 row, same width), initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n4.  **Locate Anchor:** Scan the working row of the input grid to find the column index of the single magenta pixel (color 6).\n5.  **Place Anchor:** Place the magenta pixel (color 6) into the output grid's row at the same column index found in step 4.\n6.  **Identify Block:** Scan the working row of the input grid to find the contiguous horizontal block of pixels whose color is *not* white (0) and *not* magenta (6). Record its color, starting column index, and length.\n7.  **Calculate New Position:** Determine the target starting column index for the block in the output grid. This index is `(anchor_pixel_column_index - block_length)`. The target ending column index (exclusive) is `anchor_pixel_column_index`.\n8.  **Place Block:** Fill the segment of the output grid's row from the calculated target starting index up to (but not including) the target ending index with the color of the block identified in step 6. Handle potential edge cases where the calculated start index might be less than 0 (though not observed in examples) by only drawing the portion of the block that fits on the grid.\n9.
